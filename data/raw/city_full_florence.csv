40,“Great overview of the city”,"This is a great value. We saw most of the important sights. We didn't know we would go in the Basilica, so were not prepared with our bare shoulders and were denied."
30,“Florence was not what I expected it to be.”,I expected Florence to be many items of well known art easily accessible and sensibly priced to visit. The town seems to be run by an undercurrent of hawkers who charge expensively to visit the one or two items you wanted to see. I think you do not need a week in Florence only two to three days and that's enough. What Florence really needs is a museum pass system where you pay a sensible price to have access to all the museums. But I think there are two many individual owners to make that work.I was sadly disappointed. I enjoyed Sienna More!
10,“Pritty but stinky winky”,Disgusted by the smell Florence the stinky winky streets are bad to make you sick but the sites are so pritty and nice PS love nacked statues scattered around the out scurts and popular places in Florence.
40,“Great Day Trip”,"Organised a day-trip to Florence from Pisa. 1 hour each way by express train at €8 each way very good value. Florence much more crowded than Pisa. Main Square visited and also the Pone Vecchio Bridge. Food a bit disappointing but that's the luck of the draw I guess and what you get for a day-trip. Although in General, I must say that Italians are selling the food more on name rather than on quality as I think I can get a decent and good plate of Pasta anywhere in the world at €14.00 a go.A ot of explaining to do to kids due t the large number of nude statues :)."
50,“Great place to stay!”,The best parts were the terrace and the location! It couldn't be better.It's just a studio but the terrace is huge and totally makes up for the small apt. space. You will not be dissappointed!
50,“Bellissimo!!”,"I've been here 3 times and I fall in love with Florence all over again everytime. Its such an experience just going around the small quaint shops lining the streets. There's Manelli for leather goods and souvenirs, Matiar for soft, supple leather jackets and shoes. Oh and lots more.By the way, you can check out Alcozer & J for unique costume jewellery.You can also use tripadvisor's cityguide app to go around."
50,“So much to see”,Plan before you go to make the best of your stay. Lovers off art are in Paradise here as well as those who love to go shopping.
50,“Watch out scams”,"Been here 3days,great place to visit many restaurants lots to do museums art galleries,BUT be on your guard of the African street sellers!!they approach you with big cheesy smiles and ask you for the time(strange as they sell watches)then they give you a little present a small bracelet and a little carved elephant ,they say something like its a gift because his wife has had her first baby back home or it will bring you luck,then when you accept the gift he will drive you mad for money for food or for his baby or anything that comes in his head and constantly try's to shake your hand ,BE WARNED they are very persistent tell them no don't even stop as they follow you tell them to go away"
50,“My favorite city”,"You can feel and taste the history and become a part of it. Yes you can look at all of the beautiful art but if you immerse your being you can feel what the city is about. The Florentine people are sincere in the love they have for their home. No dislikes from me, I will be back to share some wine!"
50,"“City of Arts, Romance and History”","Well, i traveled alone on september. It was a great journey. I felt safer than any other cities in Italy. I managed to roam around the city alone by foot."
50,"“Amazing things, good food, easy transport.”","I went with my husband and we had a lovley time, staying for five nights. I think you need that amount of time, at least. You cannot see Florence in a day or two and we still had much still to see when we left. One thing I have learnt when visiting any of the old Italian cities is not to wear heels! There are cobbles and rough flagstones or uneven worn pavements everywhere. With much walking to do, wear comfortable shoes, cool clothing in summer and drink plenty of water. Italy has many drinking fountains and you can fill water bottles in most places.Florence has so many famous sights and attractions and most are within easy walking distance of each other. The local bus services are excellent but remember to buy your ticket from a machine or a kiosk before getting on.We walked round most of it and took our time. There was a lot of restoration work going on, so not all attractions were at their best or open, so check before you go if you don't want to be disappointed. The gardens are worth seeing and there is a wonderful view of the city from the Bardini Gardens. We didn't end up with time to do the Boboli as well, although they were recommended.We also took the bus to Fiesole, which is above Florence and has views over the city. The air is cooler and cleaner and there is a monastery and Etruscan and Roman ruins to visit that are interesting. From those there is also a wonderful view of the mountains. It was good to have a break from the city for an afternoon. You can also get to Sienna, Pisa and other places easily. Trains are on time and very good.The food is mostly excellent, even in cheaper places, as are the wines and and we only had one meal that disappointed.A great place full of history and art with plenty of good things to enjoy."
40,“Fine Florentine”,We ate here twice because the food was good and it was near our apartment. The antipasti and primo were both quite good. I tried both the house red and white wines and they were fine. The waitstaff were professional and the prices were reasonable.
50,“A must see for all travelers.”,"Firenze contains so much fabulous classic architecture, so many world class museums and galleries, so many magnificent churches not to mention the myriad of shops, restaurants and cafes that it would take a lifetime to see it all."
50,"“A ""Must Do"" in Florence”","My first trip to Italy was on our anniverary in Sept 2014. This restaurant was part of a tour I set up through points on my credit card. But, of course, you can contact them directly and their prices are great! Chefs Varinia and Edoardo (Vary and Edo) are your hosts to their home overlooking the Boboli Gardens. Also a B&B, the Giglio Bianco, offer's 2 comfortable rooms with, I'm sure, a wonderfully prepared breakfast daily. Our evening began with prosecco followed by wine. Then a 5-course meal followed, specially prepared with the best seasonal ingredients. A delight to the taste and to the eye. Every course was truly memorable. Your hosts are there to describe each course as it's served. How it's made, why it's so special to them...a learning experience made fun. Contact at info@gigliobianco.it for reservations (a must). Be sure to tell them about your favorite items or food alergies and they will accomodate your every need. Website is gigliobianco.it."
30,“Wonderfully historic but so run down!”,"We were so looking forward to seeing Florence. The first taste you get is of overgrown weedy gardens, rubbish and graffiti. Why doesn't the council do something about it? The relics are wonderful and so steeped in history. That is of course the ones you can see from under the scaffolding. The place is over run by bus loads of tourists and the ever present pick pockets. Not a great day!"
50,“one of the most beautiful historical cities i have ever visited”,"we loved florence,the history,culture,architect,and beauty of nature, what a city,we where there on a cruise stop a must see,we have to go back to experience the museums and the churches,the uffizi and the Duomo,we walked all over the city,looked at the piazza's the buildings walked in the streets and experienced a true italian culture. Love every moment of it. Will go back"
50,“GOLD EXPERIENCE AT THE GOLDEN VIEW”,"We visited FLORENCE in MARCH,2014 and were recommended to the GOLDEN VIEW. The restaurant is ver close to the PONTE VECCHIO, right next to the ARNO river. Great view, wonderful food and excellent service!"
50,"“Ahh, Florence”","The art, the food, the atmosphere! Florence is a place to just be, absorb culture and enjoy history. The areas are safer, there seemed to be more police and less dogged gypsy pick pocketers floating about making it more enjoyable. Located close to the wine region, an hour from natural spa region and mountains, it's a definite favorite."
50,“Favorite city in Italy!!!”,"So much to see in this beautiful and amazing city: museums, works of art, churches, the Duomo. The history of the Medici family and all of the brilliant artists/inventors/architects who lived in Florence AT THE SAME TIME is astounding! And the food is amazing. So many choices for an incredible Florence experience."
50,"“""La Martinicca"", our best restaurant experience in Florence”","On a recent visit to Italy, our second visit, we took 3 day stopover in Florence, The first night we ate in a street side Café, near the ""Santa Maria Novella"", O.K. but pricey, the second night we went to the ""Il Latini"" it was a very good experience, and reasonably priced, the third day there we came across a restaurant at Lunch time, and the clientele was predominantly Local Italian, always a very good sign, we made a reservation for that evening, and we enjoyed the Best meal that we had in either Milan or Florence on either visit, at ""La Martinicca"" The Food was excellent, and when we got the bill we were astounded with the excellent value that we encountered. The service from Katarina, to whom nothing was too much trouble, was also the best that we encountered, We would highly recommend ""La Martinicca"" to anyone who is thinking of a visit to Florence."
50,“Does not dissapoint.”,The facade of the Domo inparticualr is absolutely breathtaking.Watch yourself with pickpockets and pedlars. The latter it is illegal to buy from.
50,“Ristorante La Galleria”,This hidden restaurant is beautiful place in a welcoming alley close to Ponte Vecchio bridge. Staff are awesome and the food was magical. We tried different restaurants in Florence and this is the one that I will definitely try next time that I am in Florence.
50,"“Florence never fails to amaze, visually stunning”","The Duomo, Giotto's tower, the David, etc. are so unique that even have been there many times you get impressed by the history ,art and great restaurants. Just watch out for the bicycles. They're everywhere. It used to be vespas but now the bikes way outnumber the scooters."
40,“Relax and Enjoy”,"I totally enjoy wandering through the piazzas. For me it's a time of rest while still enjoying the sights, sounds, and tastes of the city. Look around, really notice the amazing sculptures, fountains, and street artists. Have a cappuccino and a cheese plate. For a short while, feel line an Italian at home."
10,“Culture and History destroyed”,"Florence Italy is not just beautiful, it is also full of history, art and everything that makes you want to keep going back to it, except its people, their abrasivness, impolitness, lack of hospitality (specially being such a touristic attraction) made me decide I will not visit it again. Wish it was in Portugal where it would be complete."
50,“hidden gem”,"on a day visit to florence we wanted to visit bolboli gardens ,we were drop of at rosa croce square ,just by the tourist information we found a hidden gem called mug cafe,we had a coffee,whilst we waited for them to prepare our picnic,lovely choice of fresh breads,and fillings all kept in the fridge as it was very hot so don,t think they havn,t any if none on display ,the young lady in there was so helpful,after a long hot day we returned before meeting our transport for a long cold beer and were not disapointed had we have realised she had so much choice we would have returned earlier to try the local red beer,lovely casual place,plus very inexpensive coffee1.25,panninis 3.50 beer the same"
50,"“amaing views, a must see!”",we stopped here for lunch and the service was great along with the views of the river arno! great food prosecco and views!
50,“Italy at its Best”,"Firenze is a place to sit on a park bench, gaze at the amazing art work in the piazza, great for people watching, wonderful food, and shopping for leather goods is an experience in itself."
50,“There is a lot to see”,"So many things to see! The Uffizi Gallery, Accademia Gallery, Duomo (skip the inside) and the Pitti palace (wow!), just to name a few. Book tours through Viator a take a full day small group tour for a more complete visit. We had a small group guide for all but the Pitti palace. Enjoy!"
50,“I cried!”,"Firenze is my favourite Italian city! My sweet heart! I have never seen such beauty in my life, speechless! The food is amazing people are very friendly and helpful from there Firenze I took a trip to Vernazza absolute beauty!"
50,“Trattoria Accadi - A Secluded Gem in the Middle of Town”,"My wife and I first went to Trattoria Accadi in 2000, and we have been there on countless trips ever since. It's not very fancy, but the food is to die for - both their main Italian fare, and Japanese dishes. We have only ever seen an Italian menu, but it's obvious to us that there is Japanese menu, too. Toshi, the Japanese chef and owner, is well known, and at least a minor celebrity in Japan - Every time we go there, many Japanese tourists eating Japanese delicacies, as well. The Pasta is wonderful, and the sauces, delicious. My favorite dish is the gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. The salads, appetizers, main course are wonderful. The Steak Florentine is beautiful! And the fresh baked dessert ar great, too.The atmosphere, though not too fancy, is inviting because of the characters serving you. The employees are wonderfully, friendly folks. One year when we were there at holiday time in December, we were invited to stay and share in their annual Christmas party, after closing. Such nice, friendly and more genuine people you could not ask for. Just the type of local experience we always hope to have, on an overseas vacation! We will keep going there whenever we are fortunate enough to be in Florence."
50,“The waiter sat down with us and explained every dish on the menu”,"We ate at Cibreo Trattoria, there are several Cibreo's a restaurant, cafe and trattoria. We went on a Sunday night around 8:30. It was raining and there weren't many people there. We were looking at the menu trying to figure out the dishes as we don't speak italian, and when we started asking the waiter questions he actually pulled out a chair, sat down at our table and went over every single item on the menu. My two kids ordered appetizers (I don't remember what) but after expressing interest in one of the soups I didn't actually order it. The waiter brought me a bowl anyway free of charge because he wanted me to taste it. It was delicious peasant bean soup with bread....yum I wish I had some now. The rest of the meal was outstanding and he also brought us extra side dishes and a dessert which we did not order. Most definitely my best restaurant experience in Italy."
50,“Quick Tuscan Sandwich at Passquai”,"Stop by Passquai. For a great meal on the go. This tiny shop has become a favorite spot for locals and travelers alike to grab a fantastic Tuscan bite and a sip of wine. The sandwiches are traditional Tuscan fare and a flavor experience. I love the famous porchetta, carved up before your eyes. Yummy! The owners will make you feel like a ""regular"" with their warm hospitality. My husband loved it so much, we went back two times... What's not to love - real Tuscan atmosphere, delicious sandwiches, and low prices. A real find if you are a frugal traveler or not."
50,“This joint can make a grateful carnivore weep with joy.”,"As a practised and popular host this Florentine eatery knows how to cater to almost any taste. What holds true for hotel restaurants,doesn't subscribe for restaurants. Italian cities do not usually excel in a variety of cuisines,because they excel in a cuisine that is the envy of most of the rest of the world: Italian.That is where this exceptional eatery shines. To my taste buds,fish is not a Tuscan stand-out,but beef, well,that's a different,sublime,exulted story. Add to that,risotto, the veal and the lamb and you are in culinary nirvana. La Buchetta makes well fed cows relevant in their afterlife. the tables here groan with porterhouses or 'fiorentine',that can make a grateful carnivore weep with joy."
40,“worth it”,"lovely city , friendly people . food , history, shopping and scenery all good. Plan your holiday time table , where to eat , what to do as there are lot to see there."
50,“City of Michelangelo”,"During our visit to Italy, after Rome our next stop was Florence. Best thing in Europe is you can reach one city to other by train in 2 to 3 hrs. And another good thing is there main stations are in the heart of the city and you will find nice and reasonable hotel nearby. Florence is small but beautiful city, full of Arts. From here you go to wonder of the world ' PISA Tower' and if you are wine then to Chianti. so during your Italy visit do not miss Florence."
50,“Absolutely Fabulous!!!!”,"We visited Florence as a second part of our trip to Toscany, it was a very busy small city, with narrow streets, lovely character, full of architecture and tourist, it is a great experience, see the monuments, squares, something is always happening, there was a great concert in the piazza one of the nights, love my time in Florence, and the food yummmmm the Porcheta was a great sandwich, love the fast food is still traditional, no mcdonnals or burguers in city centre! GREAT!"
50,“Twist of fun!”,"As a seasoned traveler and one who loves to eat out I was thrilled when I found ""La Buchetta"".The restraunt is steps from the famous St.Croche square in FLorence and is one of my new favorite places to visit. The food is exceptional as well as the staff.The nights that they offer live music really is a great twist of fun!Give it a go!"
50,“Beware during rainy season!”,"On a cultural visit with 3 friends during beginning of October, the weather was somewhat wet! This in itself we managed to cope with, the sun did occassionally show its face, however, what no- one or no site thought to tell is that due to the river (?) possibly poor drains (?) whatever, that we would be eaten alive by midges!!! Unfortunately, I suffer from any small insect bite, but those bites lasted well into my return home! and most of the girls also suffered very nasty bites as well.So beware dear traveller, take plenty of antihistamine tablets & cream as we did & if at all possible don't go during the rains!"
40,“Always memorable”,"My wife and I visited La Giostra this past trip to Florence, as we have on four previous occasions. The food, service and atmosphere was excellent. This past trip we seemed to be more crowded and rushed than previously, but still quite memorable. We each ordered an outstanding pasta and shared a Veal Lemone. Reminder to all, each meal starts with complimentary Prosecco and antipasta, so the prices are not low, but actually quite reasonable."
50,“A great find”,"On our morning walk through Florence we stumbled across a new restaurant, La Buchetta. It had opened just five days prior-so we decided to go back for lunch. The owner was friendly, hospitable and eager to please. This restaurant is a new venture for him after having success in the chianti region. The food was traditional and simple-yet with complex taste and elegance. Pastas were all homemade. The wine list was varied. The ambience was also simple: new, clean with a twist of modern. The back dining room opens to a beautiful old palazzo. We look forward to returning to this new gem located off the ponte alle grazie. Well done Mauricio!"
40,“No charge for sitting!”,"We were exhausted after walking all day and after seeing the Ufizzi Gallery just needed a good cup of coffee. The Queen Victoria Cafe along the Ponte Vecchio offers good food, good coffee and very friendly service and a place to sit for no extra fee. My husband was not happy with his choice of wine and they gladly exchanged it for another! If you only had a gelato the seat was not extra. Unusual."
50,“Best Sandwich in Florence”,"Pino makes the best sandwich in Florence. During our five day stay in this amazing city, we ate at Pino's Sandwiches four times. Pino's has a great menu but if you can't find what you want, you can design your own. Try the ""Kelly"" if you like tasty roast beef, fresh mozzarella, sundried tomatoes, pesto and a touch of spicy sauce. The price is very reasonable,especially when you compare it to other local shops. They also offer professional wine tasting!"
50,“Osteria del Porcellino”,"If you get the chance try this perfect little restaurant. Great service and super nice! We did lunch and it was a home run. Tomato Capresse over Arugla, Tuscan bread salad, Lasagne bolognese, and cappuccino. Priced right and they have something for everyone.Via Val di Lamona 7r50123 Frienze, Italia"
40,“City is clean and easy to navigate.”,"Florence is a must see while in Italy. The Statue of David is impressively large and the works my Michaelangelo and other artists are something you will never forget. Skip the beer and coffee there if you can, because the prices are a bit high (we brought sandwiches and water and that satiated us all day. BTW, you an do Florence on one day!"
50,"“When you are in Firenze (Florence,italy)”","Firenze! This is the second place i covered in my backpacking trip. florence for me is the best city in italy, (nature,buildings,culture,food,people,river,mountains etc) at its best. As you enter the city from railway station, you see the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore, the duomo (centre of the city). Florence has the best gelato in italy,i had around 9 gelato's (dif flavour) here. The places i loved and visited are : 1-galleria accademia2-pont vecchio3-piazzale michelangiolo (for sunset with a beer at the stairs)4-Then a day trip to siena by trainshopping is like a must if you visit firenze, the leather market is a great place to bargain and buy the leather good made in firenze."
50,“Mamma mia”,"The food the service the wines the atmosphere - so good, so busy, don't miss out, book a table for lunch tomorrow"
50,“Best shopping destination”,Best shopping destination. They have most of the designer names and they have the best deal. For example Gucci shoes for $180. Jimmy Choos from $150 and up.
50,“Walk A Lot”,"The list is endless, from the train station & back.The Duomo,Bobolli gardens,the Museums.Just allow yourself at least 3 days to enjoy Florence.From Pisa to Volterra to Montaione to Florence, this is a beautiful part of Tuscany, I have no words to describe it, if you are looking for, culture, good food, warm friendly people, lovely weather, stick a pin in a map around Tuscany and go, you will not be dissapointed.Ciao"
50,“Enjoy Florence in a day!”,"We have just returned from a mini-break to Pisa and Florence. We had just one day in Florence and followed the trip advisor suggested walking route! It was fantastic and so easy to follow. We set off from the train station to find the Duomo, we decided to climb the Bell Tower (414 steps) and the climb is well worth the view when you get there! And you can stay up as long as you wish (unlike Pisa which is very regimented!) We then followed the route and had lunch at Caffe Rivoire, Piazza Signoria, a lovely laid back affair with time to people watch! The church at Santa Croce is worth the wait in the queue! We also recommend the climb to Piazzale Michelangelo to see the bronze David and admire the views. Enjoy the walk back via San Niccolo and stop off for a beer in one of the friendly bars. Walk along the river bank towards Ponte Vecchio but don't cross, carry on to Ponte Santa Trinita and reward yourself with one of the best gelatos from the shop on the corner as you cross!Thanks for the route Trip Advisor we really made the most of our day here!"
50,“Zsa Zsa Great food and enchanting atomosphere!”,Loved the food and wine at this delightful in the heart of Florence location. Appetizers yummy and inventive. Atmosphere charming inside and out. Can't wait to get back there next time I'm visiting Florence. Wine selection is extensive and food is just delicious!
40,“City tour”,"Very nice city with very old history. Best view on the town is from the top of the Cathedral. You have to go up on 463 stairs, but the view is worth it."
30,“Nothing Special About Florence”,"For all the hype about Florence it's just another riverside city, and for Europe there's hundreds of others that are less touristy and less GRAFFITI. Choose Budapest instead. Still if it's a must see for you then I wouldn't plan for more than 1 day. Also, why is it so difficult to find a restroom or WC in europe?"
50,“Free Parking for Florence Sight-seeing”,"For Americans, best to travel Italy in a rental car with an english speaking GPS Navigation unit. Consider a portable Garmin or Tom-Tom to enable walking your way to and from your destinations and the car among all the winding roads/walkways and tall buildings. For Florence, park free at Piazzale Michelangelo (Michelangelo Square) where you have a panoramic view of Florence and the Arno River and can easily pick-out your down-hill walking destinations: Uffizi (Museum), The Duomo (Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore), and the Old Bridge (Ponte Vecchio) where you can get a taxi back to your car for 11 Euro."
40,“florence”,"i wanted to just warn people about money in florencewe needed to change some spare english cash to euros on arrival. none of the banks in the centre or post offices would change any , we were directed by one teller to the change bureaus outside.so went up to one and put £300 under the glass to change it. when i got my euros i looked at the ammount which seemed low. i then quizzed the commision rate. a whopping 19.8%.nearly £60 to change £300.i got pretty vocal and demanded my money back refusing to pay such a large conversion rate.seeing as they had my money that was that , no deal, and i had to accept it"
50,"“Touring art, history and Jewish history in context.”","Giovanna is extremely knowledgeable about art, history, Jewish history and has a wonderful way of putting all of the pieces into context. Great fun to tour with her and to understand a bit of Florence, Florentine Jews and the impact of politics and art of the early rennaisance. We also toured parts of the Uffizi with her great and equally talented assistant, Eleonora. What a great way to get around such a massive and exquisite museum."
40,“A lot to do....”,A really cool place to visit if you are over in Italy. very nice and makes you feel like you are in the 15th centry. There really is to much to do once you get there. The Acidamia is great along with all the other places that are there to see.
50,“hi”,"I lived two years in Florence near Pontevecchio, literal translation old bridge.In this area there is a lovely wine cellar snack cafe ,Fuori porta (outside door) by what used to be the walls that protected Florence from invaders,alot of battles and civil unrest.Infact my own family once owned Villa Tati on the outskirts of Florence,i believe it was lost through a battle with a rival family very common during the rennaissance period.It is now owned by Harvard university very small but picturesque worth seeing.Of course you must see all the main tourist sites such as uffisi Art gallery with the Mona lisa by Leonardo de vinci a must seeBargello(place of execution)David,by Michael Angelo all around Piazza signoria.Less known is Montepulcianno a castle where the wine is from, beautiful scenery and a fun day out on the outskirts of Florence.Many other sights exquisite fan collection at Pallazzo Pitti,giardino di BomoboloSt croce,sculpures by DonatelloThere is such a wealth of art in such a small area it is mind blowing..............For shopping there is a large market by the station nr Duomo,which is a stunning Dome"
40,“Small and sweet city”,"I had been there in March. Very nice and clean city. Akademia museum is worth. Michelangelo's square gives nice panoramic view of river, Ponte de Vecchio and Florence city. Food quality much better than that of in Rome and even cheaper."
30,"“Amazing architecture, history and culture, but it is just too full of people.”","How can Florence be average? Great to be able to say you've been there, and there are some spectuclar sights,However, it is such a global tourist site, and there are just so many people crowding the medievil streets that it feels uncomfortable. There are also many smaller uncrowded fabulous medieval cities in Tuscany, that are also rather cheaper to eat and drink in. I know that Frienze has an incredible amount of history attached, but stretch out and go a little off the beaten track.It must be a real nightmare to have to live and work in the main tourist areas of the city."
30,“Expensive”,"A beuatiful city with helpful friendly locals. But you are not only taxed 4euro a day for the privilege to be there but everything costs so much: coffee 5euros, bottled water 3euros. They do milk the tourist"
50,“Florence boutique shopping”,"For a unique and personalized shopping experience, explore the little but luxe shops in the narrow, winding streets of the old city with Maren Erickson of ""florenceshop4it.""She's a chic, charming American who has lived here part-time for years and guides her clients to the best boutiques. She plans your outing around your wish list (leather shoes, handbags, or jackets; cashmere sweaters; jewelry; the famous Florentine paper ...). She'll also recommend non-touristy places for meals or an espresso break.Maren's ""business partner,"" Chia, is an adorable little dog who's quiet, affectionate, and beloved by all the shop owners. If you'd rather not have her along, though, no problem, she'll stay home.Whether you go solo, as I did, or in a small group, you'll enjoy her company. She'll offer her opinion IF ASKED--I'm a clotheshorse and found her comments helpful and her taste.Women I met on vacation and my friends at home marveled at my chocolate-brown, reversible, 3/4 coat made of antelope (not endangered) supple and light as a feather. The shop tailored it to fit me perfectly and shipped it to me, pretty quickly!Even my fasion-phobic husband gasped when he saw it, and he treated me to it. All thanks to Maren's magic."
50,“Back to basics...”,"One of the special things about Florence is just being here. The buildings and street scapes in Florence have changed very little over the centuries and today's life fits in around them. Some attempts have been made to restrict traffic in the tourist precinct between Cathedral and river, but on a whole, buses, cars, motorbikes and dogs combine to make most of the central city noisy and dirty. Florence is a living city where economic and industrial activities co-exist with the rich artistic heritage and tourist trade. In the main business centre, Via Tornabuoni, fashion houses and banks are trading internationally from 16th Century buildings that have accepted the need for advertising and computer technology in their stride. The streets and squares of Florence have somehow adapted to changing needs without changing the character of the city.WALK, LOOK at the streets and buildings and sculptures, buy some bread and cheese and sit on church steps (that is the only place to sit that is free). WALK by the river and LOOK at all the bridges and lamps and the buildings on the other side. WALK at different times of the day and LOOK at how the different light alters the feel of the buildings. LOOK at the elegantly dressed locals. LOOK at the shops and the gold and the markets. WEAR strong walking shoes or boots because most of the streets are unevenly paved and try to avoid the dog poo. If all you do is walk around you will enjoy it, and if you go to see anything else, enjoy being in the streets while you are getting there.It is impossible to see everything you ""should see"" or ""want to see"" or even ""wish you had seen"". That is the first thing to realise. There are several reasons for not being able to see things;* there is a lot to see and your time will be limited* things will be closed for some reason such as restoration, siesta, religious holidays, non religious holidays, strikes or just because they are not open.* you quickly get to the stage where you can't absorb any more ""art"" and you might as well be looking at reproductions on calendars.You need to plan carefully and first plan is to come back again. You will probably have a basic guide to Italy or Tuscany which will give details of the contents of museums etc. If not you would be advised to get one.When you arrive go to a tourist Information place to get a map and a LIST OF ALL THE GALLERIES with the TIMES THEY ARE OPEN, CHARGES etc. This will probably be one ""typed"" sheet, hopefully with a date on the back to indicate that it is current.Three such sheets are available;1/ A general information2/ What is open on Mondays and3/ Museums around Florence.When you have decided what you want to see, check it out before you get there - walk past and read what is says outside or check the ticket people. Many places are closed each afternoon and all state Museums are closed on Mondays. I SUGGEST YOU PLAN TO SEE ONE GALLERY/MUSEUM IN THE MORNING AND DO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE AFTERNOON."
30,“Cinque Terre with Alba Travel”,"We booked a day tour to go to Cinque Terre from Florence in September. The tour guide and bus driver were quite pleasant and the scenery was second to none. However, coming back, we could not help but think that we might have been better off taking a train to La Spezia and buying a day pass to access this protected area. This would have given us the opportunity to walk from village to village and be free to spend our time wherever we wanted. If you are in relative good shape and have good walking shoes, walking through each of the five villages is easy. If you get tired, you can continue your visit by train or boat and you don't have to wait for a group of people to catch up with each other several times through the day."
50,“The best Ice cream in Italy.”,If you have a car and find yourself in the Florence area visit the Medici Villa in Poggio a Cainno. Entrance to the villa and gardens is free and it is well worth a look at this country retreat of the Medicis. Opposit the villa entrance you will find cafe ROBERTA. I have travelled the length and breadth of Italy and sampled many litres of ice cream on my travels and this place has simply the best home ice cream you will ever try. Whenever I am in Florence I drive out to Poggio a Cainno just for the ice cream - it is that good.
50,“tuscany in one day tour”,"We had a fantastic trip which took us to Siena, where we had a guided walk through the village and enough time to explore it. In St Gimignano we had an excellent lunch on a wine farm, with a short guided tour, and later on time in the village; then to Pisa and back to Florence. Thanks Chris for a wonderful day, you did a great job!Elizabeth, Holland"
50,“Great Art is Just a Start!”,"A stop in Florence was right in the middle of our three week Italian adventure. There is so much to see and do all over Italy. Florence, of course, is no exception. We chose to establish a couple of ""must see, must do"" priorities for this city. We decided that we must visit The Galleria dell' Accademia to view Michelangelo's David, and The Uffizi Gallery to see some of the works displayed by Leonardo, Raphael, Carragaggio, Rubens, and other masters. Our museum reservations, secured for us in advance by our hotel, proved to be a real time saver. Just to be in the same room with these world class pieces of art is a privilege. Any traveler can spend days in Florence and not see half of this incredible city. But when you decide to spend some time in Florence, do yourself a favor and schedule time for these two museums. You will be proud that you did.Tim and Susan - Arizona"
50,“A big favorite of mine”,"While on a cruise earlier this month, DH and I took another couple to Florence on the train. We were familiar with using the trains in Italy. We started at the Domo - which was very crowded with cruise ship people on ship's tours. Then we walked the pedestrian street to the big Piazza - with the big fountain, fake David, Uffizzi museum. There were a few mimes willing to pose for photographs, the exterior walls are lined with sculptures of famous Italians, then the Arno river and the Ponte Vecchia.Then came the best part. We took a taxi to the Accedamia and used our pre-paid vouchers for admission. And spent time gazing at Michaelangelo's David - we studied the muscles, ribs, large hands, the sling and pebble. Amazing piece of sculpture. My advice to anyone who is visiting Florence - get a voucher to see the David - otherwise you will stand online for hours - photos not permitted"
50,“A lovely taste of Italy!”,"Florence is a fabulous town for walking, and I believe that we put miles on our shoes every day. We walked to shopping areas, outdoor cafes, to our sightseeing tours, and felt very comfortable doing so. From our base in Florence, we were able to opt for a wine tasting tour at a lovely vineyard and found that there were many options for day tours originating from Florence. We loved shopping in the leather market area and the fact that you could negotiate prices, noting that the price often diminished when one began to walk away. Scarves are a hot item in Florence, and the vendors were happy to demonstrate their distinctively unusual scarf tying methods, which we will try to duplicate now that we are home and found that between the 4 ladies on the trip, we purchased about 40 scarves. Okay, some were for gifts, but they may be hard to part with. There was not one bad meal or one nasty tasting bottle of wine in the 4 nights in Florence. The Uffizi Gallery and Galleria della Academia are must sees. One word of advice-purchase a large print, comprehensive street map, as the maps provided by the hotels have teeny, tiny print and can be very confusing and overwhelming. Wish we had done this in advance!"
50,“Historical Beauty”,"This was my 2nd trip to this wonderful city of culture and beauty. The people are warm and friendly, the sights are beathtaking, and the food exceptional.There seem to be no end to the historical and romantic palaces, churchs, and museums. Masterpieces are at every turn and the whole city exudes history.The one drawback are the number of seedy street beggers--but even those were less persistant than my last visit. The new mayor has made significant strides in trying to ensure visitors are not hasseled by these folks.All in all, this is a ""must-see"" city."
30,“One day max”,"Before visiting Florence, I had heard so many good things about it. I dont really get the draw. Yes, Ponte Vecchio is interesting as well as the massive Duomo. But when you combine the noise, crowds, smog, cigarette smoke with the pickpockets, it is best to pop in and pop out to say that you have seen it. I have seen it now and never have to go back."
50,“Fantastic Florence”,"This place is what i loved the best in Italy .Unlike Rome and Venice which is buzzing with human traffic ..Florence happens to delightful in all forms...and less crowded perfect for a relaxed holiday.Tourists frequent Florence for obviously the leaning tour of pisa..which is covered in a short day trip to pisa from florence.Sightseeing in florence can be completed in half a day....but the most beautiful sight one can see here is the Michealangelo piazza...from this place you can get an over all view of the florence city.its lovely out here....do not miss it .2 lovely place is Ponte Vecchio and Duomo - Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.Florence happens to be less cheaper then rome and venice.Leather goods are a steal here,do get ur hands on a good hand bag.My husband got an excellent office leather bag.i got a 2 lovely handbags from a local market near the train station and lovely wallets and small purses as gifts from here.Fridge magnets are cheaper here.When you visit the leaning tower of pisa...do pick up all your souvenirs from outside the main gate of leaning tower of pisa...because its cheaper outside.Florence is a real good city for a weekend getaway."
50,“History personified”,"The most difficult thing about Florence was finding a parking spot outside the city but once this was accomplished a whole new world opened up.Just the walk into the city was a wonder to behold. San Lorenzo was the first of many sites situated in the main market square of the city and the burial place of the Medici family. Not a remarkable building but one of great importance in the history of Florence as it was build in the 4th century AD.The cathedral (Duomo), Santa Maria del Fiore is far more spectacular with its domes, spires and of course its amazing exterior of white, green and pink marble. Its interior being beautiful although to my mind nowhere near either San Marco in Venice or of course the amazing St Peter's Basilica in Rome.The archelogical museum in the basement is something else again. The Byzantine crafted mosaic floor and the gold Cross are marvellous and should not be missed. It does however cost to see this but is definitely worth it.The other sights of Florence are of course the famous Ponte Vecchio Bridge where the jewelry shops are wonderful to look at but beware the prices are up there with best but one can hardly leave Florence with out buying a Cameo or leather. I bought both but not on the bridge. Find a little shop in the back streets and you will get a better deal. I also found the best Pinoccio puppet for my grandson in Florence. Not one of the mass produced ones and reasonably priced. Of course one cannot forget the famous statue of David although one on show is only a copy the original can be seen in the Uffizi Gallery. We could not get tickets so we had to content ourselves with seeing the copy.Laurentian Library where the architectual work of Michelangelo can be seen in the famous stairway and the reading room. This library holds one of the most famous collection of important and prestigious antique books in Italy collected by the Medici family. This should not be missed by anyone with a love of history. You will see books dating back to Ancient Greece and Byzantine. One that comes to mind is a book explaining the defence of Athens in the Peloponnesian Wars and another writing about the 5 known planets and their positions in the solar system.We were only in Florence for one day which was just not long enough but it was all the time we had. Given my trip over again I would have stayed in Florence in order to see more such as the original David and the painting of the last supper. Tickets need to purchased for these in advance preferably before leaving Australia. This I was ignorant of so don't make the same mistake. You can book on line"
10,“Florence airport chaos”,"I will be writing a full review of our magical holiday but wanted to warn everyone of the chaos at the Florence Airport. I luckily was warned by one of our group who left early but be aware that for those of you with a 6:30 am flight out you need to be there as early as possible. I was under the impression that the airport opened at 5:00. Wrong. It opens at 4:30 and I would advise getting there at that time for a 6:30 flight. We arrived at 5:00 and just made the flight. Be very careful about baggage allowances as we were 7 k over and paid 100 Euro fee. I still feel that the cakes, cheeses and olive oil that we brought back were worth is despite what my husband says! They were weighing carry on as well and it seemed that most people were paying extra. The over allowance fee must be paid at another teller and then you have to go back to the original one to get your boarding pass while threading through a maze of frustrated tourists who think you are trying to jump the que. There was also a problem with boarding passes with Air Canada/Luftanza involvement. We attempted to get our boarding passes through the quick check-in and it would not recognize our data so we had to get in the lineup. Apparently there is a problem with computers for Luftanza reading Air Canada info. The good news is we did get on the flight but it is not the exit we would have chosen from this marvelous country!"
30,“City of David and $$$”,"We had been to Florence some 15 years ago for a short stay and wanted to go back. So we returned this May. Beautiful city but not tourist friendly, We had a hard time finding the Ufizzi and Academia. I was also very put off buy there charging to visit churches. I had read about this prior to my visit but is is very disturbing to a Catholic to have to pay to enter a church. Very expensive city but you need to visit at least once. If you come from the states don't plan on shopping Things are allot less expensive in the states."
30,“florence”,"went for a long weekend,found florence very expensive and very busy,i think that rather then stay in florence and visit sienna and san gimiano as we did i would stay in say,sienna and visit florence very good train service from pisa,but not being able to get a direct flight does make it a long journey fo a short trip. The tour buses in florence are excellent and you can get on and off when you wish,they also have earphone commentries,Just north of the duomo is a street market with a small supermarket ideal for stocking up on soft drinks,"
50,“The most beautiful city in the world!”,"We visited Florence for a day whilst staying in Rome. I fell in love with this city as soon as we arrived. It is a truly magical breathtaking place. I didn't want to leave and wished that we could have stayed longer as we didnt get to see as much as we would have liked.We parked our car at PIAZZALE MICHELANGELO which is free parking and has the most incredibly beautiful views of Florence. This was out first experience of the city and the view just took our breath away! It was a great first experience of the city, we walked down to the centre, crossing the river and taking our time to explore!!The city has a great vibe to it, the people are lovely and so much more laid back than Rome. The best day of our holiday!!"
50,“Could stay for weeks”,"Florence could be the best place in Italy to spend time. There is more than enough things to do in the historical areas to fill weeks but it is an ideal base for exploring Tuscany.The people are friendly and helpful. Communication is easy because English is widely spoken or understood though it is always polite to try at least a greeting in Italian.There is food and shopping to suit the most expensive tastes, the most frugal and everything in between. There are free events on all the time and you never know what you will stumble across in a piazza.The city is very neat and very clean. We felt very safe and there are plenty of local police around anyway.A must stay on any Italian trip"
50,“Cooking lesson in Tuscany”,"We just returned from Tuscany where we took the Farm to Fork cooking lesson in Chianti from Ciao Laura culinary tours and it was a truly authentic Tuscan experience. We met our host at the farmer's market in Florence to shop for our ingredients (artichokes were in season and wonderful!) before setting out on our cooking lesson at her cooking studio in Impruneta. When we arrived at the cooking studio, we were welcomed with homemade cake, coffee and hot tea. We made several Tuscan dishes that were really delicious, including fresh pasta which I adore. We sipped wine, laughed and enjoyed each other's company while we prepared our meal that so fresh and delicious and the epitome of fresh Tuscan cuisine. This class was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and we highly recommend it to anyone interested in a non-touristy type of cooking lesson. Tuscany at its best!"
50,“Art Galore in the birthplace of the Renaissance”,"We spent 11 lovely days in and around Florence last March 22-April 2. Can we call this slow travel? The weather was superb, sunny almost everyday except one. Temperature around 17-26C. We chose the Hotel Paris, a 3-star Hotel at off-season rates strategically located between the train station and the Duomo. Couldn't have been happier with the room/hotel/breakfast and staff. Florence kept us busy. Of course, we visited the Academia and the Uffizi museums.We were grateful to have made reservations ahead of time through the internet. The line-ups, even in March were heavy. We spent almost a full day at the splendid Pitti Palace and Boboli Gardens. We also visited the Duomo museum, well worth it. The city is rich in art and history, and you can walk everywhere. The churches such as Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce are by themselves art museums worthy of a visit. We took the city bus to Fiesole one late afternoon. Lovely little place with spectacular views of Florence. To enjoy the countryside, we booked a half-day in the Chianti with Florence Tours. It was well escorted.They took us to a spectacular winery for wine tasting followed by a visit to a small typical town called Greve in Chianti. We also reserved Walkabout Tours' Best Of Tuscany tour and the Cinque Terre Walking tour. Both were professionally organized and escorted. We enjoyed both tours tremendously, especially the spectacular views of the Cinque Terre and the Ligurian seacoast . However, it is a physically challenging walk. You need to be somewhat fit. Finding reasonably priced restaurants in Florence without reservations was no problems. The time of year probably helped. We inspired ourselves from various travel sites including this one to identify the better ones. It was useful but walking around, looking at the locations and their menus worked just as well. On April 2, we continued our trip by train to the small town of Chiusi to pick-up our 10-day rental car for a visit of the Montepulciano and Assisi regions. This part requires me to write a review on its own. Overall, a fantastic trip in spectacular areas of Italy. It encourages me to explore more of Italy."
50,“Cultural Mecca”,"I can not say enough about this place. It is absolutely beautiful. It's a great walking city with little places to stumble upon that you may not read about in the guide books. There are also many internet cafes to help keep in touch. Michael Angelo's academy is unbelievable with David looming in the back. The Duomo houses some of the greatest artist crypts in the world. And of course the Uffizi is incredible. It houses some of the greatest works of art from The Renaissance. If you are a fan of the Renaissance period, this is the place to go from the architecture to the culture to the food NOTHING disappoints."
40,“Cattedrale di Santa Maria del fiore”,"Florence is noted for its Duomo..Frankly speaking,I felt so tired after I climed the campanille.But I had a good position to look at the whole city.It is an amazing city."
50,“Degradation in centre - S.S. Annunziata square”,"Hi everybody, I'd like to tell something about the news of degradation in the historic centre of Florence, S.S. Annunziata square in particular.I live in this wonderful artistic city, just few steps to S.S. Annunziata square, and I can say that my city is tranquil and there's no dangers, neither during the night.The notices that someone has wrote about homeless and other grim persons are true, but the situation is no so bed.In all cities in the world you can see some bed persons and watch some bed situations, unfortunately.. and Florence the same, but these are cases isolated.Florence is one of the most beautiful city in the world, for its culture and its artworks and history, and some bed isolated creeps cannot damage it."
10,“ripped off in florence italy”,"do not shop at MASSIMO LEATHER, we had our jackets(3 of them shipped back to us) all of them were damaged.defective. tryed to contact him more than several times and no response. he told us when we bought any problems he will handle no problem buy when you get back to the states, guess what??? all three jackets and lots of $$$$$ later and no leathers for us. so disappointed to do that to americas visiting. shame on you Massimo you are a good talker. other than our bad experience with that. florence and rome were amazing"
50,“An Art Treasure Of The First Order!”,"If you are even remotely interested in art and/or art history, Florence is the place to visit! Paintings, Sculpture, architecture...all just amazing! The tombs of Michaelangelo, Leonardo DaVinci, Rossini, Dante, and others are in one location, and are simply beautiful!The Duomo, the Square, The Uffici Gallery, and much more. The hills overlooking the city commanding a fantastic view! You can easily spend a week here and enjoy every day. That peroid of time would also allow you to go to the Tuscan country side and admire it's beauty.We were fortunate to find a group tour (something we had never done before, always having traveled on our own) through Vertical Horizon's Travel of Folsom, California. The arrangements were fantastic with accommodations and transportation all arranged, and well planned. Also well planned were the excursions. We particularly liked the walking tours.I highly recommend both Florence, and Vertical Horizons Travel. Both were a great experience!"
50,“Fiessole just a bus ride away.”,"We decided on Florence, the beautiful tuscany city.Many interesting places to visit, have a lovely cappuccino in an old cafe. Everywhere is a work of art, music in the street makes you forget you're tired,Meeting people from every corner in the world!!Then just for a train ride one can visit Pisa and stay for a couple of hours then back to Florence the enchanting old city. One can buy perfume of any scent imagined. I Profumi di Firenze just around the corner in piazza Signoria opposite one of the oldest cafe in FlorenceRivoire 1872.it is worthwhile to take a bus to Fiessole, from where you can see all of Florence from up the hills where your mind wonder and relax.Beautiful Florence it keeps calling you back!!!!"
20,"“Florence/italy: Beautiful, but crowded and Expensive - do not go in August!!”","Beautifull city!BUT: Never go in August. There are no Italiens exept for the waiters. The city is crowded with thousands and thousands of tourists as if it was a open-air-museum. Since the city is not so big, there seem to be more tourists as in Rome.Everything is very expensive (only the leather goods are OK). We took part in a Florence walking tour and payed 25 Euros for running after a giude with 25 other tourists. we were told that the fee includes entrances, but we did only enter in free-of-cost sights, which are very little. For the rest, the guide said: ""Here you can See XY, it was built by XY in the year XY. It is very nice inside, I recomend you to go later, there is a fee to be paid."" If you enter in olny 10% of the buildings you have to pay for, you will get bankrupt!!!The same for the food: Tourists menues are bad and expensive, although not as expensive as eating the regular dishes. (Attention, in Italy, theey charge the tips automatically and you have to pay for the fork... so add 20% to each price). In general, pizza is bad and the stuff unfriendly. The olny time we got good food in a nice restaurant made by nice people was in a restaurant run by indish immigrants at the other side of the river. Our solution was buying salad and bread in the supermarket and eat it in the hotel room.Leaving the car in a safe place costs 25 -35 Euros a day, depending on the seize of the car.Conclusion: Yes, one should see Florence, since the city for itself is realy a pearl. Above all, the wonderfull Cahtedral and the look from the viewpoint at sunset.But no, not in summer. Safe money before going in oder not to get a shock and don´t expect anything concerning service, friendly people or good food. At least in the centre."
40,“Enjoy it while your kids do too.”,"Florence is one of the great jewels of Europe. The beauty of the city is legendary and its ochre-colored stone buildings and bridges are poetic. So much art and science in one place, it's boggling. While traveling in Florence with kids, take the relaxed view and don't overdo the museums – also explore the old city walls and gardens in the Oltrarno area. With unique landmarks such as the Duomo and the Ponte Vecchio, Florence evokes the Renaissance like no other city.   The fun food for kids is gelato, ice cream. Florence lays claim to the invention of gelato by Bernardo Buontalenti, who made it for, who else, the Medicis. Don't go running around looking for the gelateria that supposed to have the best gelato. Just stop into gelaterias often and sample the selection. For really delicious sweets, pastries and cookies, try cafe Gilli on the Piazza della Repubblica.     The indoor Central Market (Mercato Centrale) is chock full of multicoloured pastas galore (a sight in itself), stalls with fruits, vegetables, cheese, nuts (makings for a picnic lunch), and food stalls, where you can sample all kinds of fun food.   The gold shops on the Ponte Vecchio are splashy and fun, little lacy gold butterflies, filagree rings, or enameled cameos are reasonably priced. Leather goods are traditional to Florence – look for purses, wallets, coin purses, key chains with beautifully tooled leather and the Florentine fleur-de-lis motif. Other shops have marbled handmade papers, whimsical paper frames or pencil holders. Kids will also have fun choosing painted wooden boxes or wooden toys. Florence is a wonderful place to window shop. As you're walking down any street, you'll find artisans at work, and beautiful window displays in the shops."
50,"“I thought Paris was my favorite, but I may have to change my mind.”","We had such a lovely time in Florence I doubt I can even begin to describe it.We booked an apartment through [-] The people there were helpful and attentive, and our property manager, Vincent, was wonderful. He upgraded our apartment due to a travel change by another tenant, and even went with my husband to garage our rental car when we made the mistake of driving into the older, auto-restricted section of Florence.No matter how many days you plan to stay, you will find you need to go back. There are too many restaurants, churches, museums and places of interest to ever see all in one trip.Quattro Leoni is a must. The food is delicioso!My only other piece of advice is research the city before visiting. Knowing the history there will give you a whole list of places you will need to see."
50,“A truly romantic city”,"Arrived from Rome nearly about 1.00pm. Trains from Rome that has an onward journey to the north of Italy usually stops at Firenze Rifredi Station. The place you would want to end up in should be Firenze Santa Maria Novella (SMN)., which is 5 minutes by train from the former. Ticket cost EU 1.10 each way. Check the information board for the train schedules. Trains will not always stop at the same platform number.From the railway station at Firenze SMN, exit on the left side where you see a church, there are a lot of hotels around this area.Once we were settled in at our hotel, Hotel Rome, within the square, we first did our foray to Pisa by train, which we caught at Firenze SMN train station. The journey took us about 1 hour. Tickets were EU 5.80/person one way. From the train station at, we took a bus to the site of the leaning tower. Bus will stop right in front of the site.This is one place anyone must not miss during their trip to Florence. The sight of the basilica and tower just beside it was really awesome especially when there is sunlight shining onto the structures. For the ladies, there are several stores just in the vicinity selling leather goods. Quality is good too.We spent almost 3 hours at the site, returning to Firenze SMN at about 8pm.Next day, we did our tour of FIrenze (Florence). Going to Michaelangelo Square. This place has one of the most majestic view of the city from a vantage point. You could see the river running thru town, the basilicas, the houses. It really gave us a sense of easiness and peace.We spent more than an hour here catching the views and taking lots of pictures. Then we proceeded back tot the city where we walked thru it's cobbled streets the whole day, never ever getting tired and we really took our time to soak in the sights. Did some shopping, savoring the food, it's gelato.All the time, my daughter, my wife and I feeling we had a specialconnection to the city.Remember, anyone visiting Italy must spend at least 2 full days in Florence. Give it the slip and you may just regret it. Who knows, it may rekindle the flame inside you, it certainly made mine brighter."
10,“Total Dissapointment”,"Short and sweet...Florence was a total dissapointment! I have traveled for years and had a higher expectation. The city was dirty, the museums and landmarks are not well kept. They charge a substancial amount of money for these places and they are smelly, unkept, and a let down. The people there are not as eager to please. The tourists that I came in contact with were monsters. I was pushed, shoved, and treated like a turd by the European tourists. I was in total shock, I had such different expectations of Italy. I dont mind paying for quality, however the food and attractions are expensive and not reasonable for what you get. I had good food in a few places, but overall not impressed.I came, I saw, I absorbed all of what I needed to from Florence. It could be an impressionable city and it's a shame because it has such a beautiful history. There are tons of historical things to see, I hope that they clean up their act and embrace and appreciate their visitors!"
30,“Help with Transporation needed :)”,What is the best way from Florence to Bologna .. Train/Bus/Taxi ? We're staying in Impruneta and Going to Monteveglio..any help /suggestions please?
50,“City on the Arno river”,"At the reception at the hotel they asked how to get to Piazzale Michelangelo. The girl told where the tobacco shop, where you can buy a bus ticket and what you can get on bus number 12. Tickets cost 1.2 euros and is valid 70 minutes from validation. The bus circled half the town and get to Piazzale Michelangelo 45 min. But at this point opens an interesting panoramic view of Florence. At a distance of a bus stop is the church of the XIII century, Santa Maria Miniato al. Back down from a hill by foot and 20 minutes made it to Santa Croce. This is very interesting and beautiful church full of masterpieces, in addition, here are buried the great Florentines - Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli. During our visit the main altar was closed for restoration, but in Italy all the time something is restored, the world's masterpieces bring a good income, and Italians are concerned about their welfare. The church and the museum beside the church had no less than 1,5 hours, admission € 5.I really wanted to see one of the earliest works of Michelangelo, ""Bacchus"", so we went to the Bargello Sculpture Museum, which is located in the building of the XIII century. Besides the works of Michelangelo where you can see the work of Cellini, Donatello, Verrocchio and the terracotta and glazed work Robbia family. I really liked the museum, entrance 4 euros.Not far from the museum is the church Orsanmichele, the building which was originally used for secular purposes, the upper two floors of the store grain in case of siege or famine, on the ground floor housed the church, the decoration is directed craft shops. Therefore, in the niches you can see statues of saints patrons of the various guilds, St. Mark's patron, St. George the patron saint of armorers shop, Thomas unbeliever patron of merchants.To see the city of Florence from the top you can climb the dome, or on the campanile of Giotto. We chose the latter because it can be photographed with the dome by Brunelleschi, and best climb in the afternoon, when sunlight will fall just at the cathedral. Entrance € 6, open from 8-30 to 19-30."
50,“Flower city”,"Special place - the Jewish quarter of Florence. As if transported in space and time: suddenly all the signs themselves are translated into Hebrew, and roam the streets of elderly Jews in bales and Pace. Young people, for some reason, looking back fearfully, rush to the synagogue. It is built in Moorish style and did it the third largest dome in the city, after the Duomo and San Lorenzo - it can be clearly seen from Piazzale Michelangelo. Money, judging by the size of the building and a rich finish, is not spared, the construction was completed in record time - from 1872 to 1874 years. Architects Treves, Falchini and Michele at the expense of David Levy richly decorated synagogue gilded fresco ornaments, stained glass and mosaics. The floor is paved in marble. True, during the Second World Nazis posted here a warehouse, garage and stables, and during the retreat of the synagogue looted and mined. American engineers have overlooked some of the charges, and the explosion was, but quickly regained.Market before the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi - a world apart. From early morning the sellers are laid out on trays all sorts of things, drinking coffee from plastic cups, smile and exchange news. A little later, there are the first tourists and traders are animated: somehow emerge today? It is believed that souvenirs in Florence to buy it here: leather belts and bracelets, fake brand bags, bright jackets and coats, notebooks in a leather cover, cards, jewelry, t-shirts, ceramics, flip-flops, sunglasses, sundresses, towels featuring maps Italy, etc. The best souvenir, in my opinion - a notebook from the Florentine paper in a leather cover. Market roars and rages until the first twilight, and then sellers are slowly collect counters, stacked merchandise, and wander home to restaurants, from delicious smells of baking."
50,“One of the most remarkable places-and now traffic free!”,"I have been going to Florence for decades, having first come there as a young student at the university, to do a long course in Italian.It was love at first sight. Coming from an equally old city (Jerusalem), the history laden quality was a familiar feeling. But the art, the views, the small size of the city made it special and easy in its accessibility.Thus started a lifelong attachment which has been enriching throughout.But there was always one annoyance, a terrible one: the awful traffic in the center of the city, which was also damaging the monuments. When I arrived last October, it was the day after the new Mayor had ceremoniously closed the entire city center to traffic. People were out in droves, strolling in the main piazze, reveling in a city that had been given back to its citizens.This year when I returned it already seemed totally natural and the 10 days I spent there with my daughter were so enhanced by being able to experience the city as it was meant to be, and was originally, hundreds of years ago.Traffic free Florence is a delight to the eye and the soul- and more cities should follow that example."
50,“My favorite place in Italy!”,"We have just returned from a 2 week vacation in Italy. We traveled from Rome to Florence and Venice. Florence was by far our favorite city! From the amazing shopping, food to the sights, churches and even the clean streets. We stayed near the piazza of Santa Maria Novella which is a beautiful church. Everything is within walking distance and unlike most Italian cities, this one, is hard to get lost in. Some of the must see spots include: jewelry shopping at the Ponte Veccio (bridge), the church in Santa Croce, climb to the top of the Duomo, and eat at Trattoria Za Za! The food their will not disappoint. We had the ravioli’s with a walnut cream sauce and a wild boar type pasta. The Roman artichoke was amazing as well. Florence all around is an amazing, beautiful, romantic city that should not be passed up if you are visiting Italy."
50,“A Week in Florence”,"In our week in Florence, we toured the City's main sites on foot and by local bus. Museum behind the Duomo is small but very good.Using public bus transportation, had wonderful day trips to San Gimignano (Beppone Restaurant) and Fiesole (Perseus Restaurant).Uffizi and Academia very good for Rennaisance art and works by Micheangelo. Be sure to make reservations on line before your arrive. Skip the Uffizi 16 euro art book in favor of a general book about Florence.Missed the Bagello, which we should have seen.Good restaurants were Aquacotta, Accadi, La Maremma, Italian Cafe, and Nella. Have at least one big Tuscan steak dinner, for a real treat.One week was sufficient to get the full flavor of Florence."
50,“tuscan sunshine tours”,"If you want to see the sights of Tuscany, I highly recommend using Franco at tuscansunshinetours.it. My husband and I booked him for a full day trip from Florence to Siena, San Gimigiano, and Chianti wine country and we had a wonderful experience. He was very knowledgable and took us to see little out of the way towns as well as the big sights. Franco was prompt, efficient and always friendly. he gave us time on our own as well as good ideas for places to visit in each area. Well worth the money."
50,“Florence in two days”,"My husband and I visited Florence in early October and really enjoyed our experience. The first day we took a 3-hour tour called 'The Original Florence Walk' by ArtViva and then visited the Uffizzi Gallery (make sure you buy yourUffizi tickets in advance). We were about 15 minutes late for our tour group but managed to catch up with them (they escorted us which was nice). The tour guide was good but the sound was really bad because the microphone she was using was to close to her mouth. It was hurting my ears.On the second day, we couldn't get in to see David at the Academia because we had not reserved in advance and there was a three-hour wait. We decided to skip it. (again... buy your tickets in advance). Ended up going to the Palazzo Pitti which we thoroughly enjoyed. No crowds at all and amazing art...if you stick to the main corridors you'll find artwork from very well-known painters. Amazing place that I highly recommend. Enjoyed this museum as much as the Uffizi! Also enjoyed walking through the Mercato Centrale and buying leather near Ponte Vecchio. When prices are soft.. ask for their best price.Great place for Gelato... Perch no!...Florence is definately on our 'must see again' list."
50,“A breathtaking City to be seen from many angles.”,"What a wonderful, wonderful weekend that was. 3 days in Florence, staying in a hotel on the Piazza della Repubblica.We flew to Pisa and negoiated our way by train into Florence's central station Santa Maria Novella (SMN). Our hotel, Hotel Pendini, was centrally located and made sightseeing and exploring easy.The city is jam packed full of art and sculpture and live music. But it is the lesser known discoveries you can make that are so special. The Uffizi galerry is a must see and I can recommend renting an audio guide to help you understand the art you are looking at (it is far quicker than flipping through guide books). But discovering some art of your own, without reliance on the tourist books makes it s special too. For example, the Fra Angelico paintings in each of the monks cells at Museum San Marco.The dining is broad from tourist menus (10 euros for a pizza and beer) to the fine dining. Or paricualr favourites were Lo Scudo (great house wine and a pear pasta that was to die for and around 60 euros for two), and La Giostra (expensive at 180 euros for two with wine) but delectable flavours, and so memorable.The city is best enjoyed on foot, getting lost taking turns down little roads and alleys and then coming out at a spectacular Piazza. The Piazza della Signoria is a wonderful hang out for a drink al frescoe or cafe correto whilst listening to the live music and admiring the statues which are lit at night. The walk to Santa de Miniato is worth the steep walk for the magnifcient views - and do go and explore the cemetry behind it - no one else seems to. It is the resting place of the author of Pinocchio, but is also touching in the way that lost lives have been remembered.And without doubt go and discover the little side entrance of the Duomo which allows you to (slowly) walk the steep 423 steps to the very top of the dome, with it manificent rewards for those who make it. It is not for those with weak hearts and climb is tough.I am hapy to answer all your questions!Michelle"
20,“Bad experience on bus in Florence”,"Today was my fifth visit to Florence. My first was in 1977 as a college student, and I have come back to see the art treasures every 5 to 10 years. This time, I brought a friend with me to share my love of the art and architecture of Florence. The art and architecture are still here and also still beautiful, but the city has changed for the worse in my opinion in the past 33 years. And the worst thing for us was being scammed by 3 public transport employees on a city bus in the morning.We were told that it is possible to purchase a ticket on any city bus from the driver for 2 euro, or in any bar or tabacci shop for 1,20 euro. We opted to pay the driver this morning. When we got on the bus on route 11 this morning at 9:29 am, the driver would not accept our 2 euro coins and pointed us to the back of the bus. We looked for an automated ticket machine, but only saw the validating machines. Within 3 or 4 minutes, 2 bus ""controllers"" approached us in the back of the bus and told us that we had violated the rules and must hand over our documents or be fined 45 euros each then and there. My friend and I tried to explain that we wanted to buy tickets from the driver. The 2 bus ""controllers"" put more pressure on us and threatened us further and demanded payment. They asked for our names and we gave them our names for official looking tickets, and then they asked for the money. We had the money on us and so I paid them quickly. They gave us each a receipt for our ""fine"" and we hopped off of the bus past the town center.We went about our tours as planned but felt that the scam on the bus was a terrible way to treat tourists who were told it is possible to buy a ticket on the bus for 2 euro. The experience left us both feeling abused and very down about our visit to Florence. The innkeeper heard our story and she was concerned and outraged, and she is making calls to find out why this happened to us.We won't ever be back to Florence, Italy again, I can tell you that much. We made several purchases and visited 4 museums today, and we generally found the store employees and museum employees to be scowling and very rude to us. The city center is overrun with tourists, and at times the lines for the museums can be quite long. The art treasures are still lovely, but it is also possible to see lovely art treasures in Rome with advance reservations on the wonderful 3 day Roma pass. Skip Florence altogether and set your sights on Roma, Milano, Venezia or other cities with better treatment of tourists and visitors."
50,“The capital of Culture and Art”,"Florence has always been a must visit place. Finally after galavanting everywhere in the world, we managed to get there and what is more, we took car as we also had to get to France and monaco, later on.Florence reminds me of Michael Angelo on every step. The city is just like it was in 15th Century and some of the stuff they have going on in Piazza's and the gallery are indescribable. For someone interested in History and culture, I think florence takes over any other city (including Rome & Venice).The duomo was increcibe and so was the Ufiizi Gallery. This one place contains so many renaissance masterpieces - its hard to believe.Its not cheap and a B&B will cost you over £100 a night so go with plenty of money or a good limit credit card. Meals with wines will be £40 per head on average but you have to do it as they have some great restaurants."
40,“A Great Days Bike ride In Tuscany”,"19th October 2010.We had a great day riding around the beautiful countryside of Tuscany. Beautiful weather , great lunch and chianti tasting at the Villa and Barbara was a terrific guide. Thanks to I Bike Italy tour company."
50,“My dream vacation come true!”,"Florence, Italy was my dream trip. We spent 9 days in the city and traveled to Lucca and Pisa via railway which is easy to navigate with a little patience and time. The best viewpoints of Florence are the Piazzale Michelangelo, Duomo’s dome, Giotto’s Campanile, the Ponte Vecchio and Galleria degli Uffizi with such masterpieces as Botticelli, Michelangelo and Titian and the Galleria dell’Accademia with Michelangelo’s statutes in finite and David. Each one holds its own beauty so make sure you have a full day set aside when visiting either gallery. We spent our mornings admiring the statuary around the city and enjoying walks along the cobblestone streets. Afternoons were reserved for sightseeing – the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the City of Lucca and surrounding churches, the Santa Maria Novella and Campanile di Giotto. Of course, one of the most welcomed highlights was visiting the Mercato Nuovo and rubbing the nose ofIl Porcellino, which legend has it that if you throw a coin in the fountain, make a wish and rub his nose, it will ensure a return trip to Florence. Benissimo!"
40,“Fantastic for a cultural weekend break”,"Florence did not disappoint us-it is a beautiful well kept city which is easy to get around on foot and is safe,secure and pleasant place for tourists to stay. Most people we encountered could speak enough English for us to communicate and we tried to participate with a few phrases in Italian from a phrasebook much to their amusement! It is hard to find bad food here and the the only thing that we found was frustrating was the popularity of the sites. If you don't book in advance a wait of 3-5 hours awaits you which eats into your time mercilessly. We got caught out by the Accaddemia closing on Mondays so we didn't see the original 'David' and we couldn't get near the Uffizi-my elderly companion just cannot stand for that period of time. But we saw the Old Palace and the Palazzo Pitti which were fantastic and just walking around the historic centre is wonderful. The shops were beautiful especially the window displays. The market at San Lorenzo was interesting and the ability to travel to other cities from the close-by train station meant we visited not only Florence but Siena, Pisa and Venice in just 5 days."
50,“Great city break and apartment”,"Great city for a short break in October when the peak heat is over and crowds are more modest. Superb old buildings and excellent choice of medium priced trattoria restaurants to eat out.Main attractions are the Duomo (must go up to the dome-top viewing gallery), the Uffuzi gallery (book ahead to avoid the queues), the Ponte Vecchio, the Mercado Centralle and the old town in general.In Florence we stayed at ""Firenze Giardino"" a self-catering house / apartment that we found via the Holiday Velvet online agency. Excellent for 4 people / 2 couples - just 2 minutes from the Mercado Centralle and between 5-10minutes from the Duomo. Set in a courtyard-style garden away from the street and thus very quiet. Two bedrooms each with bathroom and a living room / kitchen. All very clean.Easy access with flights to Pisa and a one hour train journey. Coming back we stayed one night in Pisa to take in the leaning tower and cathedral. In Pisa the Grand Hotel Duomo is very well placed some 200 yards from the tower and cathedral and ok for a short stay - good reception areas, very helpful staff but bedrooms ""a little tired"" whilst clean and comfortable."
50,“Great Hotel in Florence”,Wonderful stay at Hotel California. Great room and reasonably priced.
40,“Renaissance Complete”,"The city of Florence Italy has so much to offer from it's leather experts, goldcrafters, glassware, and to the art of living; that's what I loved about the city.It felt like a small town and not an impersonal metropolis. Of course the museums were fabulous but the street vendors were also fun. This definitely is a city not to be missed on your Italian tour."
40,“A beautiful city but you need to know.....”,"This is an absolutely beautiful city but I was not able to finish seeing some sites because I stopped at a restaurant that had the credit card signs on it's window to have lunch. I had to spend my last euros on my last afternoon -15.00 euros because when I gave them my credit card to pay for my lunch, they said they couldn't take it for less than 30.00 euros! The last time I was in Europe, I charged most of my purchases and food and didn't have to worry about having enough CASH. Nowhere did I read that Florence is mostly a ""cash in hand"" city. I tried to find an ATM to get some cash quickly, but to no avail. Not even the bank would cash my dollars!!Maybe they didn't understand me, but I was really frustrated! Anyway, I was not able to go into the Medici Chapel (which was on my very important to see list). They wouldn't take a credit card either. I hope someday I'll be able to go back.I just think everyone needs to know about cash. Maybe it's this way all over Europe, I don't know.....Disappointed"
50,“Best Sunsets are in Florence”,"Just before sunset, take a cab to the Piazza Michelangelo, buy a snack, and take a seat on the stairs. You will see the most beautiful sunset in panorama over the city."
20,“Florence---the new Disney Land?”,"Florence is still the art city, par excellance. That being said it has become Disney Land times three in terms of the number of tourists. On our recent trip there it was absolutely over run with hordes of visitors. My advice is to carefully pick the time of year of your visit."
50,“Favorite City in Europe”,"This city is an open air art mecca. The food is absolutely fabulous. The shopping is also a great experience. Haggling for prices is fun and expected, Most of the city is very safe. My 3 recommendations are: Il Latini (best meal ever), Camilia, (another great place to dine). and my 2 favorite hotels are (1) Pitti Palace Hotel, and the Hotel Pendini."
50,“My favorite city”,"Florence is magical. Period. Learn the history before you go. Soak up the art and architecture. Ignore the tourists, graffiti, and occasional dog poop. Always remember to look up at ceilings and buildings and down at mosaic floors. Rent an apartment and go to the market daily for the freshest food. And the restaurants are great too. When looking at Renaissance art, be sure to check out the landscapes and clothing details...don't get stuck on the religious nature of the paintings. There is so much more when you really spend time looking! Florence is wondrous!"
50,“Alessandro Cammillo best driver/sightseeing Tuscany”,"On our recent trip to Italy, we had the good fortune of hiring Alessandro to drive us from Florence to Rome, touring Tuscany along the way. He picked us up in Florence at 8am & dropped us off in Rome at 6pm, helping us load & unload all of our luggage. Enroute we visited Monteriggione, Siena, Montepulciano, Orvietto, & visited a castle & a winery where we had a private wine, balsamic vinegar, & olive oil tasting - yummy!That day was the highlite of our trip! (& we spent a total of 19 days in 12 different cities in 4 different countries on a combo land/cruise trip).Alessandro shared his knowledge & his genuine love of his beautiful countryside with us. We cannot thank him enough!I would highly recommend him & the best part is: his rates are by far the best I found! If you are looking for a tour or transfer around the Tuscany area, try him - you will not be disappointed!He does not have a website. I found him on tripadvisor. His email is alecamma@hotmail.com"
50,“Beautiful City”,"I expected Florence, Italy to be just like the other big cities in Italy. But driving in across the bridge was beautiful. The sun was setting on the river which our hotel faced. Seeing the statue of David was a much more emotional experience than I had intended. It was an awesome site that I will not soon forget. The restaurants were fabulous and the owners of those restaurants were even better. Definitely one of my favorite cities in Italy."
50,“Florence Shop 4 It”,"I just got back to the states from a trip to Italy which included three days in Florence. I love fashion and shopping and was overwhelmed with all of the gorgeous things there. Since I had limited time, I sought out a shopping guide. I found Maren, an American woman who lives half time in Florence, and really knows the shopping scene. I told her what I was shopping for (shoes, clothes, bags, leather jacket) and she took me to her favorite shops. I got just what I wanted, and it was great to have someone who spoke both English and Italian. At some of the shops, she was able to negotiate a better deal for me, which was fantastic too! She was also able to answer lots of my questions about how to make a phone call, where to buy tickets, good restaurants, etc. To top it all off, she has a great fashion sense, and helped me to select things that look good on me!"
50,“Shopping in Florence!”,"Shopping in Florence is awesome but can be overwhelming unless you speak Italian and know where to go. Maren's shopping help allowed me to accomplish in one day what might have ordinarily taken a week and cost me a small fortune. She's honest, delightful company, speaks Italian and knows the best shops for whatever it is you're looking for (I was looking for shoes, boots, clothes and handbags) and can negotiate the best prices. Maren saved me time AND money. I heartily and highly recommend her.Contact Maren at: florenceshop4it.comPatty, Dallas, TexasTripadvisor member"
50,“amazing florence”,"What a trip,flew to Ireland spent a few days there.Flew from dublin to bologna, bus to bologna train station,train to florence.Easy to find train takes 30 mins.Florence is amazing beautiful seems untouched.The museumes are amazing book in advance though lines are hugh.We stayed in the Borgaise palace art hotel, central to everything,buffet style breakfast every morning,staff very nice,nice rooms.You can just walk for hours around Florence and not get lost,the city is just amazing"
50,“Wonderful self-catering apartments in Florence”,"Just have to share our experience at Residenza il Carmine situated in Santo Spirito, Florence. Self-catering accommodation situated in a quiet street in Santo Spirito. Probably not the best area but within easy walking distance to all major sites in Florence. The apartments are comfortable and clean with bedroom, small sitting room/open plan kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen is very well equipped and also has a microwave, toaster etc. Even though it is self-catering the owners provided a basket of croissants, butter, jam and cheese on the kitchen table. Yogurts were in the fridge and we were thrilled to find coffee, sugar, oil and vinegar in the cupboard. Everything was scrupulously clean, bed comfortable (TV) and bathroom spacious (hairdryer). There was adequate cupboard space to hang clothing. The apartments are run by charming people who are able to communicate in English. They were extremely hospitable and we were absolutely thrilled to find such a great apartment for Eur79 per day!"
50,“Cycling in Tuscany - day trip from Florence”,"I took a day tour cycling in Tuscany with Tuscan Bike Tours - Keith and Andy. It was well-organized, fun and good value. It's a great way to get out of Florence and see the breathtaking countryside. The day trip includes a visit to Castello Poppiano, a family run vineyard and olive grove. You get to taste both the wine and olive oil. Andy and Keith are great tour guides putting safety first followed closely by a lot of fun for all of their guests. I hadn't been on a bike in years... and it was as they say just like riding a bicycle! Donna, Vancouver Canada."
20,“Hiking the Cinque Terra”,"We took a hiking tour through the Cinque Terra from Walkabout Tours from Florence. We were not prepared for how extensive the hiking portion was and were totally exhausted at the day's end. Be aware that you pretty much are hiking all of the time, some of it pretty steep and dangerous. Yes, the scenery is lovely, but we did not get to enjoy it much as we were too busy watching our feet as there is much rubble on the path and you could easily injure yourself or roll of the cliffs. We had little time to explore the villages. We would arrive, catch the train or the boat and be off hiking again. People we know, who have explored the area, were amazed that we spent the whole day just hiking. They said that most people stay at one or two of the villages and maybe do short treks. We walked four of the five villages. Next time we will stay at the middle or last village and enjoy the beach and the villages.Our guide was just fine, we were just disappointed that we did not have more downtime to relax and actually enjoy the locale. We had no idea how far each village was from each other and that all of our time would be spent travelling. It was a marathon."
20,“Florence- Save your money”,"We just returned from a vacation in Rome and Florence and Rome had a lot more to offer than Florence. As the architecture in Florence is very limited, we found Florence very pricey, with every museum and church costing on average $8.00 to $10.00 to visit. The masterpieces are scattered around the various museums with very little else to offer. For example, to see Michaelangelo's David, you are looking at $12.00 to enter, and besides a few of Michaelangelo's unfinished sculptures, there is little else to see. To go up the Duomo, for a subposendly spectacular view of the city, you are looking at $10.00 a person and you get to climb over 400 stairs to enjoy this view. This price does not include entrance to the actual church and is a real rip-off! Unless you were one of the first ones to stand in line upon opening time at 8:30 in the morning, you could wait for up to 3 hours to enter some of these attractions. Ordering your tickets online to skip these line-ups set you back another 58% of the actual ticket price. The food in most restaurants was average but pricey. Even tap water costs 2.00 Euros and most meals were about 20-30 Euros a person. I sound like a cheapskate, but I am not! I have traveled throughout Europe extensively in the past, and therefore highly recommend that Florence clean up their act! Literally! Graffity is everwhere! You could smell the urine while waiting in line to get into some of the museums and the Italians sitting next to you at the restaurant like to light one up just when you are about to enjoy your meal. (They hate these pesky tourists in their city). In terms of value, comfort, hospitality and attractions, I much prefer Rome, Paris, Prague, Munich and London."
50,“One day Presto tour from Rome to Florence.”,This was our fourth Presto Tour during our trip to Rome. This Presto tour was magnificant. We took a high speed train from Rome to Florence and got there in 80 minutes. Our Presto guide Mietra knew so much about Florence and truely made this trip wonderful. We saw all of the highlights of Florence especially the David by Michel Angelo. Mietra told us so much about Michel Angelo which made seeing The David even more wonderful. I would recommend any Tour Presto gives. They have the best tour guides that are knowledgeable and really. care.
50,“Florence Ghost Walk- Great”,When my husband and I booked the tour we had no idea of what an amazing thing we were going to experience. While walking through dark alleyways guided by ghosts we discovered an extraordinary Florence we would not have seen with the usual tours. We were impressed with how entertaining and interesting or guide was!
50,“Florence with Paola of Florence Guided Tours”,"We took our two teenage daughters on a short trip to Florence in June. We only had a couple of days. We wanted to see the most we could during our visit, but had to be concerned about how our teenagers would enjoy all the history and art. Our private walking tour with Paola had the girls (and my wife and me) completely engaged. She answered our questions in perfect English and gave us insight into the art, architecture, history, politics and religion that surrounded us. Paola’s stories brought the city to life in a way that grabbed our daughters’ attention. We extended the planned tour when it was over, as we wanted to spend as much time with Paola as possible. She also arranged for our 9:00 AM entry into the Accademy of Fine Art, which we were unable to accomplish ourselves. I highly recommend a tour given by Paola. If you are able, take a private tour.Roger, New York, NY"
40,“Best Western is classy in Italy”,"My husband and I spent the last weekend of July 2010 at the Best Western Palazzo Ognissanti in Florence Italy. The double room was nonsmoking and had an ample size bathroom. They offered bathroom slippers to walk on the the tile floor. There was a daily breakfast included in the price. For a 4 star hotel, this was the best I had seen in Italy. It was very close to the train station, shopping and major museums. This modern hotel was a real treat after our Mediterranean Cruise.."
20,“terrible Uffizi apartment in Florence”,"We visited Florence in late July not the best time as it is VERY hot 30-36 C. But of course school holidays dictate that the family can only travel then. I found the service people rude and brusque. There are simply too many tourists there in July so they do not care. This was in complete contrast to the people in Venice and Naples and even in Rome we received better service. There are plenty of nice Italian cities choose another one.In part our negative impression of Florence was due to the terrible apartment we rented the web site description was inaccurate to say the least. UFFIZI APARTMENTS FLORENCE do not stay there. The rooms are hot despite the claims of air conditioning, there are 2 units but one was broken and the windows do not close so there is no hope of the cooling the apartment, was no garbage bags, no soap, no dish washing liquid, no shampoo, no internet despite claims of this, no bicycles etc."
50,“Siena tour with walkabout office”,"Excellent one day tour to Siena-San Gimigniano-Pisa only for 80 euros, lunch at on organic farm included.It is organized by the tour office ""walkabout"" in Florence.Ask for tourisr guide Christina, she'll make your day unforgettable.Thanos - Georgia from Athens Greece"
50,“Walking Tour of Florence”,"Artviva: The Original and Best Walking Tours” http://www.italy.artviva.comI had visited Florence previously but without the benefit of a knowledgeable tour guide. Since I was bringing my sons this time, I really wanted them to get the most from the experience. I had NO idea what I had missed! Sara was so passionate about medieval history that we were enthralled- the fact that she could keep two teenage boys focused in 95 degree heat while walking for over 3 hours says it all! All three guides were great but the walking tour with Sara really immersed us in Florence’s past. I’ve already told all my friends not to miss it on their next visit!"
20,“florence train station”,"For those of you not very familiar with train stations in Europe, I want to give you a tip. When buying train tickets in Florence be sure to ""validate "" them before you get into the train.If you do not do this( there are some yellow small machines at the entrances of the platforms) you get fined inside the train and not for little money"
50,“Florence: a journey to the beginning of renaissance”,"Till it occurred, everything that happened was seen as act of God. But then man took destiny in his hand. David challenged Goliath. This is was you can witness symbolically through the famous sculpture and the numerous art museums in Florence. The Uffizi and the Accademica galleries are filled with artworks from the renaissance period. From masters such as Botticelli, Michaelangelo, Vinci and Brunelleschi to others less well known, Florence is steeped in the story of renaissance art.Ohh and it has the best ice cream in the world. I had not known that ice cream could taste so good, so so so good. I would definitely suggest to rent an partment for several days and explore the city at leisurely pace and take a couple of excursions in to Tuscany."
50,“One of my favorite destinations in Italy!”,"Florence was the perfect city to visit in Italy... it provides all the European charms you expect, but with fewer crowds than in Rome!There are great hotels in the pedestrian area with great restaurants and piazzas within walking distance.There is so much to see and do and not be overwhelmed!I will definitely return to Florence one day!"
40,“Florence Then and Now”,"I went to Florence 30 years ago, as a student traveler, and was so enchanted and completely in love with the city that I wanted to return there with my kids. The Florence that greeted us was not what I expected. Florence still houses some of the great art treasures of the world, yes.The Uffizi gallery is still one of the most beautiful places you will ever go. The artwork is breathtaking, beyond description. But the city itself has taken a huge aesthetic hit. The streets are littered with dog poop which is overlayed with sheets of newspaper which add to the visual mess. Garbage collection does not seem to keep pace with garbage production. The walls of many buildings, even some of the oldest ones, are covered in tacky flyers and grafitti- and I'm sorry lads, the grafitti is really bad. You live in Florence, for God's sake, the cradle of Renaissance art. If you must be a spray can Leonardo, and since the city obviously doesn't remove your work very often, at least check out Paris and Rome for some creative art tips. Florence's civic pride in its architectural heritage seems to be caught up in maintaining the collections and buildings one must pay to enter, but not in making the experience of visiting Florence a pleasant one for the moderately financed tourist. If you have the money to stay in a nice apartment or 4 star hotel then this post does not apply to you. Unlike Rome which has many fountains and piazzas providing the weary traveler a place to sit and cool off, Florence offers few convenient, pleasant, and free, spots, (that I could find on a hot day with two kids in tow) to just sit and gather your wits for the next site. Yes, you can sit at a cafe, many of which will charge you 2 euro per person for the pleasure of sitting in their chairs, plus 10% service charge, and 3-4 euro per coke or water bottle. A brief rest can cost more than you bargained for.On our way to La Specola (a great destination for kids, btw) we grabbed some food at a market but after walking several blocks could not find anywhere to sit and eat it. We were very near the Boboli gardens, and discovered that,for 6 euro each, we could have our picnic on the grounds. It was lovely. But, again, it was almost $8 dollars US per person, (at the time of this post) to enjoy the luxury of sitting.The piazza in the attached photo is Pz. St. Marco, near our modest and very nice hotel (Hotel Cimabue). It has benches, but the noise and smell of traffic whizzing around the square made sitting there less than relaxing.So, is Florence worth the visit? Absolutely. Florence houses some of the most exquisite treasures of human existence. But wouldn't it be nice if the government of Florence did something with all of the money they must rake in from the sights they provide to make the experience of visiting their city as inviting, beautiful and inspiring as the treasures they possess? As inviting, beautiful and inspiring as it once was?"
40,"“Lots to see, so be prepared to walk!”","There are so many beautiful sites to see, so be prepared to do a lot of walking. Definitely think about buying tickets to museums, like Uffizi Gallery, in advance so you don't have to stand in line. Also it's easy to plan a day trip to go wine tasting in the Chianti region, so look into that before arriving. There are lots of great restaurants everywhere, like La Giostra. Definitely a city worth visiting for two days if not more."
20,“Camp MichaelAngelo Florence”,"This campground was on a pamplet that also had ""Camping village Roma"" and ""Camping Jolly Venice"".Out of the 3 campgrounds camping village is by far the best, the other 2 are not even in the same category.Anyway.....Camp MichaelAngelo Florence has a shop that also sells pizza, icecream, small snax, a market that is only open for a few hrs, the grounds you camp on are not very nice, and is on a hill, there is only one toilet block although it has 3 sets of toilets but is in the same location not around the campground.Pay for wireless internet that only works in area by shop, you have to give your passport for internet use, even though you already gave your passport for check-in, and their are no power points where the wireless works. Silly.Would not recommend to others,Overpriced hugly for what you get."

50,“Shore Excursions - Pisa/Tuscan”,"June 2010 - We booked our shore excursion with a private tour of PISA and the tuscan area thru Viaggi D'ambra. Christian was our guide and spoke english. He is very knowledgable with the Chianti region, Pisa, Greve and Lucarelli. He is also knowledgable in wine, cheese and prosciutto. We visited the most beautiful areas (small towns), had a wonderful delicious lunch in Lucarelli and visited an old, but beautiful Winery, Castello D'Albola. Viaggi D""Ambra fulfilled our wishes of visiting Pisa, a winery and going home with Chianti Classico and cheese. Christian also informed us what we can bring back home to the US. I purchased prociutto at a duty free store in the airport and the salesperson told us it was okay to take back to the US. Well, she was wrong (Customs took it) and Christian was right (no meats allowed into US, especially since it is cured and not cooked).Anyway, we had a wonderful time and are more knowledgable of the Tuscan/Chianti region. We were back at our ship (NCL Jade) by 5:30 pm..exhausted, but happy."
50,“A Must See: Museo de Dan Marco”,"A former convent and seminary, the monks' cells boast original Fra Angelicos. Has a lovely outdoor courtyard plus fascinating to see how nuns and friars lived going back to the 15th century."
50,“Fave City in Italy (: SO FAR”,"This beautiful city full with history; is another Rome, but with much more interesting stuff. There are beautiful people as well. Everything seems to be wonderful and Italian guys are so handsome.!"
50,“The Original & Best Walking Tours in Florence”,"My husband and I did the three in a day tour. We had two different guides, one for the walking tour and the other for the Uffizi Gallery and the Accedemia, can't remember their names but they were so informative and knowelegeable about Florence, the buildings, museums and all of Florence's history. It was wonderful tour. It was worth the money. Would highly recommend this tour to friends. Joan & Bill, Arlington, Texasjkolp1011@sbcglobal.net"
50,“Top attractions in Tuscany”,"We have just returned from a short holiday in Tuscany. We went by Ryanair to Bologna and caught a train to SMN station in Florence.After seeing Tripadvisor's reviews, we decided to stay at Corona D'Italia which was a short distance from the train station and yet not far from other top attractions. Excellent hotel for the price we paid with clean, spacious rooms and a generous and varied breakfast.In Florence, we visited Santa Maria del Fiore - Duomo, from inside and also climbed 436 steps to the top. The breathtaking views are worth the climb.We then visited il porcellino - bronze boar - near the Mercato Nuovo, which is said that it will bring you luck.Other great places were Piazza della Signoria, where a copy of Michelangelo's David is and a visit to the Galleria deghi Uffizi. From there we headed to Ponte Vecchio and ended the day by catching the Bus nr. 12 or 13 to San Miniato al Monte. We stopped at Piazzale Michlangelo and a little further up hill to a beautiful church offering spectacular views of Florence.The next day, which was a Sunday, we hired a car and visited Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti, both beautiful and tipical Italian villages.We then headed to Siena, with its jaw dropping Cathedral. Also don't miss the Piccolino Library. Had lunch in Piazza del Campo.We then went to San Gimignano - a truly awesome place. Can't explain the beauty of this medieval city, with narrow alleys and beautiful views and also best ice creams !The next day we only managed to buy Italian cheese and salami from an indoor market near the hotel and sadly it was time to return home.Although our holiday was short, we did manage to see quite a few places with careful planning and advice from other Tripadvisor members."
50,“Florence - Can't Wait to Return”,"In April, 2010, my friend and I travelled to Italy and stayed in Florence for 3 days. Being two females travelling to Italy for the first time, we found Florence very safe and easy to get around. Our main mode of transportation was our feet, but we occasionally used the public transit buses to get into the city centre. The art, the food, the shopping and the friendly atmosphere made quite an impact on both of us. Before we even left Florence, I had made up my mind that I would return on my next European trip. Just one word of caution - if you are intending to see the Statue of David in the Accademia, you may want to book months in advance, and certainly before you leave for Italy. I did not heed Rick Steves advice and sadly could not get into the Accademia during our stay. Although we didn't get to see David, we did have a very good time in Florence. I would recommend everyone who goes to Italy visit Florence."
40,“YOU REALLY CANT MISS FLORENCE”,The only reason I went to Florence was to see the statue of David I admit it- and it didn't underwhelm me. It was great. But the rest of the city was pretty cool too- I really didn't know much about Florence before going but to find out its rich history with DaVinci and Michaelangelo- the Medicis. And then you get up on the bluffs and it looks JUST like it did 500 years ago- pretty amazing really. And seeing that beautiful multi-colored tiled Duomo is pretty neat- not to mention all the other beautiful statues around town. Its a definite don't miss. Not only that but behind the Duomo- AWESOME leather shop with great prices!
50,"“Worth the crowds, a must see for all travelers”",This city has it all: beautiful art; history; shopping; good food; and wonderful culture. Wish there were more places to sit (for free) and enjoy it all. A walk at night in the piazzas is a must.
50,“The Best Tour of Tuscany”,"Yesterday a busload of strangers boarded at the train station in Florence for a tour of Tuscany. As one couple said it was ""more bang for the buck""....it was wonderful.Our guide was Sandra and she was precious, entertaining and we all highly recommend her.Children under 12 are free on this trip!!For your 80 euro you will be pleased.You go to Sienna where you meet a guide who will take you through.The church in Sienna is one of my favorite in all of Italy...check it out. Then on the way to a working farm you will see a video about he palla that takes place in Sienna 2x a year.Lunch is wonderful...probably because of the 4 types of wine they serve you from their own vinyards. The entire meal sans the cheese is from the farm.Then to San Gimignano...the city of towers....a beautiful little town to walk off lunch.Then it's Pisa....I think the architects of Pisa spent to much time at the wine estate....just try to figure out the angles?Then it's back home to Florence.We all recommend it and ask for Sandra!!Sergio was a wonderful driver as well.All in all the entire bus was very, very happy!CiaoDebra Weitala"
50,“Jewelry Shopping in Florence”,"If you're looking for good deals in jewelry in Florence, visit J & S Jewelry ( to your left when facing the Basilica of Santa Croce). Ofelia, the friendly owner, offers beautiful gold jewelry at prices more reasonable than you'll find on the Ponte Vecchio. Her pride in her store and friendly manner make shopping here a memorable experience."
50,“Walking Tour of Florence”,My wife and I and 2 friends recently visited Florence but before going we arranged for a personal tour of the city by a young Australian girl called Freya Middleton who has lived in Florence for the last 10 years. She gave us such a wonderful late afternoon tour of the southern side of the city and it was fascinating! I had no idea of the depth of history in this city and her knowledge and enthusiasm was incredible. I will always try and book a walking tour for any place I go to from now on. Do yourself a favour if you are thinking of going to Florence - email Freya at freyasflorence@yahoo.com and book one of her tours - you won't regret it.
50,“PRIVATE TOUR OF FLORENCE & PISA”,"May 17, 2010We have just returned from Florence and Pisa, Italy where we got the most amazing English Speaking tour of that region by private van and driver/guide. who also spoke French which was great because a couple in our group were from Montreal and primarily spoke French. ROME CONNECTION (www.romeconnection.com) was a highlight of many days of port stops on a recent cruise. Ships frequently discourage you from taking a 'private tour' not connected with the ship for a variety of reasons (they make more money on their own tours). After checking online reviews, I could see that satisfaction with Rome Connection was very high. We booked a van for 8 people. On time and looking professional, our driver/guide picked us up at the ship, drove us over an hour to Florence, and showed us more things than I thought would be possible, including the statue of David, and then took us to Pisa to see the leaning tower. All tours are customizable - let them know what you would like to see, possibly the Tuscan countryside? The guides tended to be life time residents of the city, highly educated and proud of the history of their city. The guide knew which sites would be the busiest and when, so we did our morning schedule to see the sites that would be the most busy in the afternoon. If we wanted to see an attraction that required a ticket, the driver would call ahead en route, say he had people who wanted tickets, and when we arrived, the guide would go to directly to the ticket window to get the tickets; then we were ushered in a different entrance or placed in a different line that eliminated the wait. The guide suggested a non-tourist restaurant for lunch – to save time, the table was already set up for the 8 of us - and the food was great. The guide would take us to a destination we wanted, telling us about the site before he let us off at entrance to let us explore on our own, always giving a time and meeting spot to regroup, and always being flexible if we wanted more or less time there. I would, without hesitation, recommend RomeConnection as a private tour company. I reserved a date, and within 24 hours on Cruise Connection, found 3 other couples to share our tour and the cost. From our ship there were several other vans of 8 also using Rome Connections. All future tours for us will be private tours - not the multi-person ""motor coach"" frequently used by the ship. We paid less for a private tour by splitting the cost, than we would have paid for a ship tour. We saw more of the city and were flexible, than what was scheduled on the predetermined itinerary of a ship tour. We were driven back to the ship in plenty of time for our departure. I also scheduled the Rome Connections for a private tour in Rome, and was extremely satisfied there also. The tours are customizable, so if there is something special you want to see, it can be worked into your tour. These two private tours were the highlights of seeing the cities on our trip. These tours would be very family friendly, and a great way to choose what you would like to see, or have this company suggest an itinerary for you. Very Satisfied Customer!!!Naples, Florida"

10,“Careful of Artviva (The Original and Best Walking Tours of Florence)”,"My husband and a friend recently signed up for the all-day Artviva (Original and Best Walking Tours of Florence) ""Best of Tuscany"" tour of three hill towns in Florence. They were taken to two of the three towns, as promised, but instead of the third, they were taken to a leather factory--in the hopes of getting them to buy things! This was an incredible rip-off. We wrote the company to protest, and never heard a word in response, and no apology.Careful!!!"
50,"“Go deeper in Florence, Italy”","My wife and I experienced ArtViva's (Walking Tours of Italy) unique cultural evening on Friday early May. A chilled glass of Prosecco in a small initimate group, a talk by an artist or author based in Florence and a wonderful interactive expose' of the rich history , culture and idiosyncrasies of Italian life from no less than a Count (or Prince depending on the night). Well worth it at the end of the day's tourist buzz which can some times be soulless. This had heart!Tim Middleton"
10,“Tourists scam - Limited (Restricted) Traffic Zones”,"High fines are sent few month after the visit to Florence for driving in a ""Limited (Restricted) Traffic Zones"".These zones are not well marked (at least not for the average tourist eye) and you can find yourself easily driving in one of these zones without any notice.This can only be described as a scam designed to squeeze money out of innocent tourists. Many people report recurring fines and abuse of the fine collection processes by local renting companies.See more info:http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187895-i68-k2226761-Pisa_Restricted_Zone_Traffic_Fine-Florence_Tuscany.htmlhttp://www.bella-toscana.com/traffic_violations_italy.htm"
50,"“Chef Vary, Florence Italy and Sunny Tuscany, Italy”","March 10, 2010My husband and I have just returned from a 2 week tour of Italy. We had a wonderful time. Florence was my favorite, although we did go to Venice, Rome and the Tuscany area.We decided to hire a guide, which was the BEST decision we made. Our guide was Laura, who works with Sunny Tuscany,(www.sunnytuscany.com). She was so knowledgeable about Florence, she was born there. Laura was a ""driving"" guide so we were able to see a lot of the surrounding area and several of the small villages. We did not rent a care. Traffic is horrible!We went to all the sites, plus with a guide we did not have to stand in the long lines. We had the added perk of knowing the best time to go to the various museums and attractions.One of the highlights of our time in Florence was with Chef Vary. Our guide set up a 7- course Italian meal with this remarkable chef. We went to the Bed and Breakfast (Giglio Bianco near the Pitti Palace) where we were served an EXCELLENT meal. The atmosphere and food was exceptional. Plus, we enjoyed this time with people who were ""true Italians"".Websites:: www.gigliobianco.it and www.chefvary.comOur trip will long be remembered. We hope to return in the futureJudy,Madison, MS"
50,“6 Day Break. Florence and Venice. Fantastic time.”,"Having booked cheap flights with Ryanair from Liverpool, we arrived at Pisa airport. No holdups on arrival and bought a train ticket to Florence which lasts 6 hours from being validated in the machine on the platform. Wanting to have a look at the leaning tower in Pisa, this ticket allowed us to stop off in Pisa and still get through to Florence. Not bad for 5.70 Euros. The train takes about 5 minutes to get from the airport to Pisa Centrale railway station. The leaning tower is about 15 minutes brisk walk from the station but only a 5 minute bus ride. Get the bus ticket from the tabacconist in the station and it is cheaper than on the bus. About 1 Euro for 90 minutes, enough time unles you want to go up the tower.Train to Florence took about 75 minutes. We stayed at the San Georgio and Olimpic hotel just across the square from the station. Pleasant stay, cheap and chearful. Busy at breakfast time but what the heck. If you have a street facing room be prepared for the street cleaners and people passing by at all times of day and night.Florence is a lovely city with plenty of places to visit. We tend to take the City Sightseeing bus tours wherever we go and this one had spectacular views from all around the city. The bus stop was just round the corner from our hotel.Lots of markets throughout the city. Always barter with the sellers. You'll be amazed how much they will lower their prices. The jewellery shops on the Ponte Vicchio are a must to see but pricey.Food was good and we found a lovelly trattoria only a couple of minutes from the hotel. The da Guido, Via Faenza, 34r. is a must. Good food and drink, attentive staff and relatively cheap. Locals use this eating house and that must say something.Next stop Venice. Recommend Florence to everyone."
50,“10 day trip to Florence”,"We recently traveled to Florence and had a WONDERFUL time. Thank you to everyone on TA as I used a lot of suggestions from here! Here is a summary of our trip:Saturday - arrived in Florence from the US, took bus from airport to train station, walked to hotel from train station - Hotel Globus. After checking into hotel, walked and walked around Florence - in awe - such a beautiful city! Had dinner at Trattoria Za Za - delicious!Sunday - enjoyed Florence - walked up to Piazzale Michelangiolo (definitely worth the walk) - the views were incredible and went into the church near there (Basilica di San Miniato). What a beautiful place with beautiful vistas! Lunch at Gustoleo for pizza - it was good and dinner at Trattoria 4 Leoni - very good, had ravioli with pear and gorgonzola - delicious!Monday - went to Chianti region with Filippo of Tuscany Car Tours. Had a wonderful day. Went into Greve in Chiani and did some wine tasting as well as enjoyed a local market and butcher shop. Went to a winery and had lunch there (Trattoria Di Montaglia). Beautiful scenery as we drove through the area. Filippo was very knowledgeable and friendly, enjoyed being with him. Had dinner at Ciro & Sons - it was OK, service was probably the worst we had while in Italy but food was good.Tuesday - went to the Uffizi - our daughter is studying in Florence and we were able to listen in on her Art of the Renaissance class while they toured the Uffizi - so we were able to hear so much about the art work - it was wonderful. After that we went to the Pitti Palace - some of our group went to the gardens and the rest of us toured the house. Beautiful. Then we went across the street to the Cafe Pitti, sat outside, had a delicious bottle of wine and cheese platter while waiting for the rest of the group - my kind of relaxing! For dinner we went to Trattoria Marione - food was good as was the wine. Enjoyed it.Wednesday - took the slow (cheaper) train to Venice. Loved Venice - great place to visit. Glad we did it but if you can take the fast train - definitely do it. It seemed like we were on the train a lot longer than we were in Venice. Had lunch at Trattoria Aquila Nera - nothing special, service wasn't great and neither was the food but we were hungry so it worked OK. We came back to Florence late and were hungry so we walked around the corner from our hotel to Ristorante Regginella - great service, very nice staff, and food was really good. They were very accommodating even though it was so late.Thursday - We took the train to Pisa. Walked from the train station to the Leaning Tower - very nice walk. It is a nice little town. We liked it - people were friendly. We stopped at a gyro place on the walk which was really good and not expensive. From Pisa we took the bus to Lucca. On the bus we asked a local for a restaurant suggestion for dinner - she recommended Buca Dii Sant Antonio. In Lucca we rented bikes and rode around the wall and then through mostly the pedestrian zone. It is a beautiful town - I could live there! We had dinner at the recommended place - a little fancier and more expensive than the other places but the food was very good and different - our adventurous group tried baby goat, rabbit, wild boar and then I had the vegetarian plate since I wasn't feeling as adventurous - all in all a very good dinner. We took the train from Lucca back to Florence around 10:30 pm - it was a nice ride of about 1 1/2 hrs.Friday - enjoyed Florence again. Went to the Mercato Centrale - bought our souvenirs - salami, limoncello, proscutto, cheese, truffle butter, pasta, wine - lots of goodies! The locals were wonderful and even the older ones that didn't speak English we were able to communicate with and they were very pleasant. Walked to Sante Croce and toured the leather shop. Had lunch outside of Sante Croce at an outside cafe called Finisterrae. This was such a nice restaurant and we had perfect weather to sit outside this day. The food and wine were delicious - everyone enjoyed it. For dinner we went to Il Latini - this was a family style dinner and we weren't even given menus. The meal was nice but it ended up being extremely expensive - I don't think I'd go back.Saturday - took a tour with Franco of Tuscan Sunshine Tours to Cinque Terre. What an absolutely beautiful place! The ride to Cinque Terre was nice - passed the carrara mountains with the marble in them - very nice. Franco took us to Portovenere, helped us buy ferry tickets, and gave us directions, map, and times of how to go from village to village. It was really a wonderful day. We had no problems getting on and off the ferry, walked through the different villages - each one gorgeous. Had lunch in Vernazza at the fortress when you come off the ferry - Ristorante Belforte - once again we were very adventurous - tried anchovies, calamari, octopus, sea bass, all kinds of stuff. It was all delicious. Service was very good too and of course we had the Cinque Terre white wine. We were back in Florence around 7 pm, went to Mamma Mia ristorante near the piazza republica - it was good.Sunday - went with Franco of Tuscan Sunshine Tours to Montepulciano and Pienza. It was a rainy and cold day but the scenery was still gorgeous. We were able to walk around the villages (with our umbrellas) and able to enjoy the area. We did some wine tasting at some shops in Montepulciano. Then went to Pienza where we had a delicious lunch at La Buca Delle Fate. The picci pasta was delicious as was the house wine. Service was very good and the restaurant was nice and warm - so we really enjoyed it. Nice shops in Pienza to get some souvenirs. We returned to Florence around 6 pm. Had dinner at Trattoria 13 Gobbi - very good. Service was excellent as was the food. We had the famous florentine steak here and it was very good.Monday - flew home to the US.In summary, this was my first time to Italy and I learned that I'm pretty sure that I was Italian in a previous life :) I felt so at home there, I had no problems communicating with the people there, and I LOVED the wine and food. If I win the lottery, I will definitely move there. I have traveled to many places but right now Italy is my new favorite place! As was suggested on this forum, while we went from place to place I just looked around and took it all in - enjoyed each moment - that is the way to see Italy!"
40,"“Airport, Rental Cars, driving, and toll gates”","Have read disaster stories about this airport recently. However, we came in about noon on a Saturday. There was no one at customs or immigration to greet us into the country. Also, no baggage. We went to the baggage claim desk filled out the appropriate forms, and they gave us each a very nice overnight kit. We had included one change of clothing on our carry-on, so we were OK. Stayed at Loro Ciuffenna, about 20 kilometers SE of Florence off A-1. Our bags were delivered late the next day.Getting to the car rentals is easy now. When you exit the baggage claim / customs area, go through the double doors and do a U-turn to the left and go outside. The rental car agencies are in a building to the left with windows facing outside into the parking lot. There is a building straight head of the exit door but that is not the rental car building. They are farther to the left. The parking lot for the cars is even farther to the left past the building housing the agencies themselves. Note: If you rent a Fiat, some of them, but not all, have a ring around the gearshif lever which must be pulled up in order to get the car into reverse.I'd strongly advise you to google the maps on how to get out of the station and get to A-1 if you're going that way....paying close attention to the directions of roads and exits. It isn't difficult, but it can be if you haven't a clue where you're going. The autostrada (A-1, and others) are marked in Yellow in Italy. Take the maps with you and use them!!!I'd strongly advise you NOT to drive in Florence proper. Since I was taking a train to France from Italy, I was initially going to return the car to the Stazione SMN, but decided to return it to the airport instead, and take a taxi to the Stazione. I'm glad I did.Toll gates are another problem. Getting onto the autostrada is OK, but don't get in the Telepass lane. Get into a lane for a biglietto (photo #1). Most of the time, the ticket will already be in the slot ready to be pulled out.Exiting the autostrada tolls is another problem. Be sure you get into the lane marked with a hand icon in black, signifying the presence of an attendant who can take your ticket and money and give you change (photo #2).I'd also strongly advise you to look on the internet and learn the roadsigns in Italy. For example, a circle bordered in red with a cross or red slash does NOT mean no entry, it means no parking. A red circle with a white horizontal bar across it is NO ENTRY. Learn the autostrada signs and regional road signs if you plan to drive off the autostrada.Beware that gasoline is diesel and benzina is unleaded gasoline in Italy. The benzina pump handles are green. Often, you'll need the car key to open the gas cap. You'll have to hold the cap with one hand and turn the key with the other. Otherwise, the cap just spins around when you try to turn the key. I had no problems with using credit cards at the pump in Italy....France was another story!Europeans LOVE turn-rounds. Seems like EVERY block has another round. Guess it saves money on traffic signals, stop signs, and overpasses. All the autostrada are well-signed with plenty of warning for exits, etc. However, if you plan to drive on small roads, be careful. Some are not wide enough for both a car and bus to pass each other. I had to back up 100 ft to let a bus go by on one occasion. Also, if you're going to drive on regional roads to explore, start with a full tank. Stations aren't always easy to find on back roads.Italian cars make love on the highway....seemed like there was always another cary trying to enter the tailpipe of my car....can't count the number of times I just pulled over to let the other car go by. DO NOT DRIVE IN THE LEFT LANE ON THE AUTOSTRADA if you aren't passing someone else. It isn't uncommon in the USA to find the left lane hoggers just because they can, even though it's rude as hell! In Italy, they're even more rude if you don't move over....and they're right! You aren't in Kansas anymore! In Italy, keep your left turn indicator on until you are ready to move back into the right lane, and then switch indicators. Not before.I'd suggest you buy a good travel vest and use it to keep wallets, passports, and other valuables in while in country. Don't ever leave without your passport. Copy your passport face page and put a copy in each suitcase you check. It'll make it easier to identify your luggage if lost. Also, keep a copy on your person and one in your room. If you lose the passport, it'll make it easier to get a new one.We had international drivers' licenses, but no rental car agency in either France or Italy wanted to see them. All they wanted was the USA driver's license. Don't forget to take it with you!!DO NOT TAKE TRAVELERS' CHECKS. No one will cash them...anywhere....except occasionally a major bank...and then only after a major hassle. Certainly a local bank will not cash them. No stores will take them. Use your ATM card and pay the fees. ATMs are everywhere. Talk to your bank. Sometimes they'll waive the fees for foreign transactions if you're a good customer.It is the custom in Italy for most shops and businesses to close from 12-3 pm. This includes many gas stations (usually not those on the autostrada), and banks. Some stations will have a credit card pump still open during the lunch closure."
50,“Elegant City”,"An exceptionally elegant, gracious and graceful city. Unsurpassed art, architecture and history. Friendly, helpful people. Lively and beautiful streets and public places. Great shopping and dining. Leave at least 3 or 4 days."
50,“Ponte Vecchio gold bracelets”,"(June 2009) I bought three gold bracelets from the famous Ponte Vecchio jewelry shops. At the first shop, I bought two intricately twisted gold bangles, $500 each. At the second shop, I bought a gold link chain for $500. When I got home and wore the bracelets, I found that the two intricately twisted bangles were too delicate for daily wear and bent out of shape easily. I worry that they will break. The gold chain bracelet, however, wears beautifully, even daily, and when I compared it to a similar gold chain link bracelet (a little smaller and lighter from James Avery jewelers--my favorite jewelers), I found that my purchase stood up very well to the similar bracelet from the jewelers that was $1500!! I would buy more next time I go--watching for the more sturdy pieces, of course."
10,“don't drive in Florence”,We rented a car in Rome this year and drove it up to Florence. We drove around the tourist area looking for a parking space and didn’t find one but we did get 4 citations in 12 minutes by camera for driving or stopping in a “restricted” zone.Still not sure what we were guilty of or how we were to know about this but the citations amount to about $800 and the city sends the bill via a collection agency so there is no communication between the city and yourself.This situation has me very upset with Florence and makes it hard to recommend the city to others.
50,“A must see in Italy”,"I was a first time visitor to Italy in November 2009 and I allowed a good amount of time to explore Florence and Tuscany.Some of the highlights for me were:1. Guided tours within Florence - I did a 3hr guided walking tour of the historical centre of Florence with a tour guide Freya Middleton whose stories and explanations made the city and it's history come alive - better than any guide book - especially for me who knew nothing about Italian/renaissance history and art (and nevery really had any interest in it - before now!). As a result of this I also did another tour with Freya of the Basilica of San Miniato al Monte on the other side of the river which had the most amazing views of Florence from, found out about the history represented in the frescoes in the basilica - the sacristy being my favourite, saw the artisan products produced by the monks, and listened to the monks doing their Gregorian chants (which they do each night at about 5pm), the tour finished just on sunset so the views across Florence from the basilica were a wonderful sight.2. Best of Tuscany Tour which was a day tour booked with Walkabout, which was a great way to see a number of wonderful areas in Tuscany when you don't have your own transport - Siena, San Gimignano, a Tuscan lunch at a wine farm, a lovely Chianti countryside drive, and Pisa (Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Field of Miracles) - it was a long day but very worthwhile to see some highlights of Tuscany in one day and great value too. It would have taken me a whole day to get myself from Florence just to Pisa and back so being able to fit this in as part of a tour was great for me and also gave me a taste of where to go back to and spend more time during a future trip to Italy. The tour guide Sandra spoke English very well.3. Palazzo Vecchio - free guided tour of the town hall (previously a Medici palace) and the Medici rooms. I did this based on a recommendation from Freya (and received from her good instructions about how to book it) and it was a great find. You do pay to enter the Palazzo Vecchio (town hall) but the tour itself seemed to be free (no additional cost to the entry fee) so long as you book the tour before paying to enter - you have to walk past the first ticket office where you pay to enter, then at the next desk section on the right you book on a tour, e.g. say you want to book a tour in English (or whatever other language they might offer) - there were a couple of different types of tours being offered at specific times. You then book your tour ticket and then take that ticket back to the ticket office to pay. It's a bit complicated (and not well advertised at the Palazzo Vecchio itself) so it was good to have been given the instructions in advance. Basically the 'guided tour ticket' is a different sort of 'ticket' to that of the general entry even though ultimately the cost appeared to be the same, but you have to book the tour first then pay (even though the tour desk is physically located AFTER the ticket office)! That's Italy for you. I ended up booking a 1hr 'general' guided tour of the Palazzo in English, and found that I was the only person booked on to it at that time, so I ended up with a personalised guided tour for just the cost of the entry fee.4. Salvatore Ferragamo museum - a fun way to spend a couple of hours looking at wonderful bespoke shoes from the Hollywood stars of the past plus others, at a cost of only 5euros and the entry fee included the use of a free audio guide (available in many languages).5. Uffizi Gallery and David statue - no need to say more.6. Gelati - a few fantastic gelaterias in Florence were Gelateria dei Neri (on Via dei Neri), Vivoli Il Gelato (on Via Isola delle Stinche) and Grom (on Via del Campanile).7. Restaurants - a couple of good ones are Zio Gigi (on Via F. Portinari) a great little osteria-pizzeria, and Il Desco (on Via delle Terme) which is a great find in a quiet street - when I had the grilled mushroom cap and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.8. Not having to queue to enter museums etc (November is a good time of year to go!)"
50,“White Florence”,Just to share with all TA friends how beautiful was Florence under the snow on Dec.19/09
50,“www.tuscan-wine-tours.com”,My husband and I went to Italy in April of 2007. I found Rebecca and www.tuscan-wine-tours.com on Tripadvisor in late 2006. It was the #1 on the list of Things to do in Florence. A spot which it held until recently when it was removed from the list due to jealous competitors. Our wine tour with Rebecca was the highlight of our trip to Italy. We ate probably the best meal of our entire trip while on the Chianti tour. Rebecca was an excellent tour guide and even made the tour fun for my husband who is not really into wine. I have recommended her tour to friends who recently traveled to Italy and will continue to do so for the future. When I return to Italy I will not hesitate to book another tour with www.tuscan-wine-tours.com and neither should you.
10,“be aware in florence”,be aware my husband had the video camera stolen from the video bag around his neck at a bus stop near the station around 8pm at night. we are always vigiliant about this sort of thing but it still happened to us in a crowd. they unzipped the bag without him knowing and took the camera.
50,“Explore the Amazing City of Florence!”,"Florence is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Florence is highly admired by tourists for its enchanting scenic beauty, magnificent architectural monuments and the eminent tourist attractions.Florence attracts tourists from all over the world. You should explore the striking city and visually feast your eyes by visiting all the famous tourist destinations. Here is a list of some of the best place to go:Palazzo VecchioIt is known as the old palace and is the most significant building in the beautiful city of Florence. The construction of this path breaking monument had begun in 1299 and it was the sitting place of the Priors of Art. The creator of this majestic monument was Arnolfo di Cambio.The Pitti palaceLuca Pitti had built this architectural beauty in the middle of 1400 to display his power and authority to the family of Medici. The regal palace would arrest your attention and you could do nothing but stare at its magnificence.The CathedralOne of the ornate architectural wonders dedicated to Italian Gothic architecture is the Duomo or the cathedral. This building has been designed by one of the eminent architect of his time Arnolfo di Cambio. The construction of this exquisite monument was completed in 1367.The CupolaIt is one of the favorite destinations of tourists from around the world. A renowned sculptor Filipo Brunelleschi had initiated the construction of the Cupola. It is dome-shaped and the diameter of the inner dome is 41.5 meters which is very close the maximum limit for any stone-based dome. It forms a landmark in the city of Florence.The Basilica of San LorenzoIt is the oldest church in the city of Florence. This church was refurbished in 1060. The present building was conceived and designed by Brunelleschi in 1423. This classic building exudes beauty and a majestic charm, which is successful in casting a spell on most all of its viewers.The city of Florence symbolizes ground-breaking Renaissance art and the glamour quotient of this city is truly astounding. The rich cultural heritage is very well displayed by the standing museums of the city. You must visit the Academia which has mind-blowing creations of the world famous artist Michelangelo."

50,“The Most Beautiful City”,"Firenze is a fabulous city. It's so small that you never need a car and can easily walk anywhere. There are buses and cabs for those of you who don't love to walk. We love to stay in an apartment in order to get the true flavor of the area. That way we shop for fresh produce, pasta, wine, baked goods and cheeses in the local market. The Mercado Centrale is amazing. There is so much to see and do in Florence that two weeks is often not enough time to see all of the museums, churches and statues in addition to visiting the shops, restaurants and parks."
50,“I love this city!”,"I went to Florence in May 2009 with my fiancée. We stayed for 2 weeks and I must say that we didn’t want to leave! Absolutely everything about this Renaissance city is inviting. I actually think I could live here. Florence is located in a large valley in a hilly/small-mountainous landscape. History is calling you as nature is surrounding you. I rank this city very high up there in terms of being walkable. You will want to walk everywhere since cars can access much of the city anyway. Careful with the high heels because your ankles could get hurt because of the cobblestones. The dance clubs are okay, but try not to go to the one or two that the tourists always go to, because then you will wind up partying with a bunch of Americans instead of a diverse crowd. I could spend a few years in this town and still not get tired of touring it. Of the hundred or so things to see, I suggest absolutely going to the top of the cupola of the Duomo. View is unlike anything you will possibly ever see. It overlooks the entire city and surrounding area, and the angle is astounding. The other place to see is piazza Michelangelo. Take the bus there (40 minutes?) and you will be on a hill overlooking the south side of the city. There is a much more nature and tranquility feel about this place, and it is also extremely picturesque/romantic. The gelato is VERY good in Florence, so don’t miss it. For restaurants, I tried Acqua al Due and thought the quality and ambience was exceptional. A tad pricey though, but worth it if you can afford it. Regardless of what steak place you go to, get the exotic types of steak like with raspberry sauce or lemon wine sauce. Make sure you bring mosquito repellent because they are pretty bad in the summer here. Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the city as much as I did. Florence definitely hasn’t seen the last of me!"
50,“A day in Tuscany”,"My husband and I just returned from a trip to Florence and Venice, Italy. The week we spent in Italy was wonderful, and I would like to share with you the day we spent in Tuscany. Our guide was Nathalie (natintuscany@hotmail.com). The day we spent with her was the highlight of our trip. She picked us up at our hotel in Florence at 9AM, and away we went to explore all the castles, small towns and wineries in Tuscany. Nathalie was extremely informative and knowledgeable of the entire region, and a great guide. We made many stops along the way until we reached Siena. What a great small medevil town! We had lunch there and also had time to shop. We returned to Florence around 5 PM. Along with the tons of information we came back with were also great recommendations for dinner. If you are going be in Florence and need a guided tour of Tuscany, I highly recommend Nathalie!!"
50,"“Art and Architecture, you can get it all in Florence”","After being in Rome for a couple of day, we were excited to meet up with our friends (joining us from California) and take a day trip to Florence, Italy. Our fabulous travel agent, Gigi, who was traveling with us, arranged for a chartered bus to take us on the 3 hours (each way) trip. We were considering taking the train there (which would be about 2 hrs each way) from Rome. But then all of us (about 32 people) would need to meet earlier and get to the train station at least an hour beforehand, just to make sure we all got a seat. So getting a chartered bus was going to take the same amount of time considering the bus was pick us right at our hotel. Also, taking the train would have meant leaving Florence when the last train departed, and we all wanted to stay as long as possible (serious shopping takes time!). So taking the chartered bus would allow us to be more flexible with our time.Although we departed Rome at 6:30am! for the 3 hour bus ride to Florence, it was exciting because this was the first day all 32 of us were getting together to officially start our 14 day Mediterranean vacation. Our bus stopped halfway at the Autogrill in the Italian countryside. It was like going to a nice truck stop or 7-11 store in California, where people could stop and fill up their cars with gas, get some great Italian snacks and souvenirs, go to the restroom and stretch, and then get back on the road.When we arrived in Florence around 9:30am, we were greeted by our Florence city guide that Gigi had pre-arranged for us. She had met the guide on one of her previous trips to Florence and was impressed with him as a guide, when she overheard him leading another tour through the city. As we walked through the city, our guide talked about how Florence was an independent city state that became one of Italy’s leading powers for 300 years (from 1434 to 1743) under the banking dynasty of the Medici family. During that time, its cosmopolitan society and wealth attracted artists and architects, who filled Florence’s streets and museums with some of Italy’s greatest Renaissance works. We visited the Galleria del Academia, which houses “the David” statues and many of the famous Renaissance sculptures. Our guide spoke about the meaning of the pose that the David sculpture has (it was fun when he used one of the kids in our group, Garrett, to imitate David’s pose in the Galleria), and the damage and hidden repairs that have been made to the sculpture. A few of us also visited the Uffizi Gallery, which housed many of the masterpieces of famous Renaissance art by Michaelangelo and others. I really enjoyed going through the Uffizi with my friend, Ann, who was an art major in college. She was able to explain to me the differences in the various masterpiece artworks that she remembered from her studies. Tip: need to pre-purchase your Uffizi museum tickets beforehand to avoid the long waiting lines to get in.Walking through the city, more incredible sculptures from the Renaissance era can be publicly seen everywhere. My favorite place to sit and soak in the flavor of Florence was at the Piazza della Signoria, an open-air museum in the center of Florence. We rested in the shade of the arches of the Loggia dei Lanzi, which were erected between 1376-1382 for the public ceremonies of the Signoria - there are many sculptures on display. In the Loggia, there are six Roman statues representing heroines and HERCULES AND THE CENTAUR, by Giambologna. To the sides of the loggia there are two masterpieces: PERSEUS WITH THE HEAD OF MEDUSA by Benvenuto Cellini and the RAPE OF THE SABINES by Giambologna. After our 2 hour tour finished, this area served as a great meeting place, when our group split up into different directions to go eat (some went to have some fine dining with our group foodie), shopping (many went to the leather swap meet nearby), or just walk around and get lost (that’s what the kids did).Florence is filled with incredible architecture everywhere you walk. There is the massive Duomo (cathedral) and Campanile and the famous Baptistry doors. These doors consist of a series of panels representing the stories of John the Baptist preaching to the Pharisees and baptizing Jesus, stories of the Old Testament and representations of the periods of art/sculpture during the Renaissance period. Brunelleschi’s Dome is the largest dome of its time built without scaffolding and took 16 years to build. One can climb the 463 stops to the top (we were too hot and tired to do this) to view the city and see how the inner shell of the dome provides support for the outer shell of the dome.After a full day (and night) in Florence, we welcomed the 3 hour chartered bus ride back to Rome to hear about what everyone did in Florence, and especially what was purchased (many leather goods were purchased at a great price like purses, wallets, jackets, and where the best gelato was, and where everyone ate. Some paid way too much for their food (my daughter must have had the look of a tourist to have paid 12 Euros for a gelato!), but it was fun to share the first of many stories to come on our trip. The only sad part at the end of our day to Florence was that we didn’t get to stop by the Autogrill on the way back to Rome. Until next time."
10,“Florence Hop On Off Bus”,"We recently visited Florence as a day stop on our Mediterranean cruise - Oct 2009. We arrived at Florence Train Station and proceeded to purchase a ticket on the Hop On Off bus. We have previoulsy used the Red buses in Singapore, Paris, Rome and Barcelona and they were great. Beware!!!! Do not use the green Open Tour buses in Florence. They are infrequent (min 40 min wait at stops between buses), bus stops are impossible to find. All the major tourist sites are walking distance from each other, including the main train station. So put on your comfortable shoes and walk. You get around much faster than these buses. If they ever turn up..... For the EUR20 pp you pay for 24 hours, that's a lot of taxi fare if there is more than one of you. Taxis are not expensive, so if your feet give up, jump a cab. Your 24 hours will run out before you get around on these buses!!!!!!"
50,“A World Class Treasure!”,"I recenty returned from my 3rd trip to Firenze and have to say I am more in love with the city than ever. It amazes me that you get to see some much beauty by simply strolling the streets and narrow lanes.The historic center is very easy to cover by foot. My favorite piazza is Piazza Signoria with the Palazzo Vecchio and the Loggia dei Lanzi and the fabulously ornate Neptune fountain as the backdrop. Everytime I step foot in this Piazza I stand and slowly turn 360 degrees to take it all in. (note: do not enter this piazza for the first time unless it is before 9am or after 3pm to avoid throng of tour groups lining up to head to the Uffizi.You can't beat the Ponte Vecchio in the late afternoon for fabulous photos. Stroll across the bridge and gaze at all the jewelry stores with the elaborate gold on display. Stop in the middle of the bridge for great views of the other bridges up and down the river. Notice the ""locks of love"" along the railing and barriers. It's become a tradition for those in love to attach a padlock with their names and date to the bridge.I was disappointed to learn that they now charge to tour the Santa Croce. I understand the reasoning, but it takes away from what I remember. The last time I was there you had to put coins in the little boxes to light up the frescoes. I felt a little nostalgic for the way it used to be. Also, the leatherworks school that used to be in the back is no longer there. On the plus side, since we had to pay the ticket came with access to the cloisters, and crypt. The cloisters are very pretty and it's always nice to see some green in Florence.One fun thing to do is to go to the Piazza della Repubblica and go to the Rinascente Dept. store. It's a very nice dept. store, but the reason for going is not necessarily to shop, it's to go upstairs all the way to the terrace cafe. The view of the Duomo is outstanding!!!The Uffizi museum is one of the best museums anywhere in my opinion. Having said that, if you have limited amount of time you will definately want to make reservations and limit your visit. Just pick an amount of time you want to dedicate and keep working your way through the museum. Your hotel can call ahead for you and get a reservation number for you. At your alotted time just go to the appropriate door where you pay 14 euro total for each ticket and the line up at another door to enter.My sister and niece had never been and we saw all the ""highlights"" within an hours visit and they don't feel like they were rushed or missed out. Visiting the rooftop cafe and the gift shop is not included in that hours time frame. We downloade a free podcast from Rick Steves. It lasts about 46 minutes and gives great info on the museums most important works.I had read for years that the best gelato in Florence was Vivoli and so my niece and I made it a ""must do"" while there. Vivolis is close to Santa Croce. We made it there on our 2nd day. Wow! I was not disappointed. The exterior is understated and the interior is not very fancy either, but oh the gelato. I had mirtilli (blueberry) and it was so dang good!We had lunch and then dinner because we enjoyed it so much at Gusto Leo. I loved my gnocchi con quattro formaggi and bistecca alla fiorentina. I found the prices to be very reasonable. Located just a 5 minute walk from Piazza Signoria. I highly recommend it.I can't wait to go back to Florence and take in even more! Ciao!"
50,“Under the Tuscan Sunset”,"Wandering Through ItalyPart Two: TuscanyThere is much to see under the Tuscan sun, but where I found my most precious moment was under the Tuscan sunset. As I settle into the relaxation and quiet of Fiesole, I saw a gold reflecting off of the stone rooftops of Florence, the buildings of which look as crowded as the streets of the charming Renaissance town. But the gold didn’t stop there. As the sun settled lower the hills took on the richness of light, their green trees and most of all the rocks protruding from within, were coated in a color that I am sure was created solely for that setting Tuscan sun.With Steinbeck in my lap, the taste of wine and cheese of the region on my tongue the memory of the delicious art of the day lingers easily in my mind. I saw David today, and thanks to Eliana from Driver Guide Services (more on them later) I saw him with the eyes of an informed art scholar, giving all of that credit to my gracious guide of course. The Academia was only the start though. (Thanks again to skipping the Academia line.)The Uffizi gallery, albeit overwhelming, might very well be my newfound favorite museum in the world, and at the very least the Boticelli’s are worth the trip. It was incredible. It was a multi-cultural experience, what with the French, German, and Japanese tours that I listened to long enough to identify. Lesson learned: once accepting the crowds as a part of my day, I quite enjoyed the variety of people.My favorite part of my day in Florence, with Eliana and the other four lovely people who were a part of my tour, was that we all agreed it would be more pleasant to head outside of the center for lunch. The restaurant was the definition of authentic. Italians lounged around for most of the afternoon doing their very best to communicate with us, at the very least introducing us to their favorite “Digestivo.” Which is the interesting and increasingly amusing way Italians say after dinner drink. Of course, everything is increasingly amusing the more of them you taste.I opted to stay outside Florence, or rather above the pretty town. Which brings me to my sunset. The perfect end to a perfect day.I have to say thank you to my Irish turned Italian friend from Harry’s in Venice for recommending my tour guide.Drivers Guide Service was wonderful. They are a fourth generation tour company from Rome, though they have experts in every city. You can be sure I will be using them for Rome and the Vatican. Learn the lesson: Those of you out there like me who are averted to crowds and sacrifice important sights to avoid them, Italy is the wrong place to succumb to your fear. The sights there are flocked to by millions for very good reason, and with the right locals to guide you it can be perfectly pleasant.Buon Viaggio!! ☺"
50,“Florence- wonderful flavors of Italy”,"Florence, Italy was a very easy city to navigate in, both on foot and by bus. We were traveling with a private group of about 35 people, and had a wonderful guide. The highlight of the city was the statue of Michalengelo's David and the Baptistry with their magnificent doors. We found the city to be very clean, with lots of interesting shops, and eating places to sample. There were so many attractions to see in our short time, but all were easily accessible and maps were easy to follow. Florence definitely piqued our interest to return to Italy another time."
50,“A night to remember”,"One night we went to a concert of Opera Highlights at St Marks Church (www.concertoclassico.info) onVia Maggio. The singers voice gave us goosebumps. and she was accompanied by the founder of the Opera (started in 1985). All proceeds from the Opera (they also perform full opera shows there) go towards feeding children in India. The price was very reasonable, and a wonderful introduction to those who have never experienced opera, as well as seasoned theatre goers. The setting was also beautiful."
50,“Amazing Honeymoon adventure”,"Our second stop of our honeymoon was in Florence. We arrived late at night from Venice and had no idea what to expect. We had a room booked at the Leopoldo House and it was exceptional. Upon waking up the next morning we found ourselves in a city of wonderful culture and spirit. Everywhere we went we truly felt the Italian lifestyle. We started out day on a great tour called ""Taste Venice."" Toni was absolutely the best! She was so informative and took us on a 4 hour tour of Florence, tasting amazing foods all along the way. We tried meats, cheeses, pastries, oils, vinegars, spices, and of course a lot of gelato. We ended day with a stop by the Accademia to see David. What a sight he was.The next day we woke up a bit late and missed our van to go tour the Tuscan countryside. As the rain began to fall our stomachs sunk. We felt like we were about to waste a whole day. We decided to rent a car and attempt the trip ourselves. It turned out to be a great idea. We saw several castle towns, toured a few wineries, and ended up in Siena for dinner. Such a great day!We end our few days in Florence with some great shopping at the markets and eating more of that great Italian food. Of all of our stops over the 2 weeks I have to say I really felt like I got the true Italian experience while I was in Florence."
50,“Favorite city in Italy”,"Florence was our second stop on a 10-day tour of Italy. After days of rain in Venice, rolling into a sunny, dry Florence was a welcome relief. We stayed at a hotel about a block away from the train station, the Hotel Diplomat. Wonderful place. Not too expensive. Nice sized rooms, an excellent Continental breakfast, and a very nice staff. We dropped off our bags, and headed back outside to do a bit of sightseeing before our scheduled bus tour.We signed up for the Hop on/Hop off bus tour. I'd recommend this tour to anyone wishing to see the city. Our guides were informative and really shared their love of their city with us. We had a 24 hr pass tour, so we rode the entire 90 mins, taking pictures of various sites. We rode along the river, up into the hills. The beauty of Florence was in full view once we reached the Piazzale Michangelo. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.After the tour, we headed for dinner at small, neighborhood restaurant down from our hotel. We had stopped in for lunch. The food was fabulous, so we decided to try their dinner menu. Even better. Rich flavors. Excellent wine. I could have ordered a second helping. It was just that good. What can I say? I could have skipped Rome (at this point) and stayed a few more days in Florence, exploring all the places we didn't get to see, restaurants we didn't get to sample.eI don't know what I expected from Florence, but I was thrilled modern architecture hadn't taken over. That's the charm of the city. It hasn't been overrun by high rises and other trappings of a modern city. It has retained its past, guarded it fiercely. As evidenced by the disdain for the statue we passed of a armless woman, carrying a stone slab on her head. We were told it represented modern times carrying away the past. Some liked it. Most didn't.Florence was bookend between stops in Venice and Rome. Florence, to me, represented a merger of the two. A little bit of the old. A little bit of the new. Just the right mix. It was wonderful."
50,“Best olace ever!!”,"Florence has it all : great sightseeing every corner you go, for all the art lovers you will enjoy Galleria Del' Academia and Uffizi Gallery, do not miss visiting Palazzo Vecchio the rooms and decorations are just marvelous and do not miss climbing the tower next to the Duomo. i would not recommend entering the church if the queue is too long it is not really worth it.. and the rest of the city is a beauty!also you will find great pizzarias and restaurants all over the city, ponte vecchio has a great view specially in winter!!shopping lovers will enjoy it too very much!"
50,“Beautiful Florence Italy”,"A beautiful city with wonderful history. I proposed again to my wife after 25 years of marriage. A wonderful, romantic setting."
40,“My favorite place in Italy”,"A friend and i traveled throughout italy and greece for 16 days in Sept/Oct '09. My favorite, though, was Florence. Great food and relatively inexpensive prices, great gelato, nice people, and the city was a manageable size by foot. In addition, there are plenty of sights to fill your time . .including the Duomo, and the Uffizi Gallery among others."
40,“A few words of caution”,"Others will, rightly, dwell on the art, the sights and the catering, so I content myself here with a word or two on some odd topics that we would have liked to know about in advance.(1) BITING INSECTSWe went in October in temperatures that allowed us to wear shirtsleeves late into the evening. Unfortunately, there seems to be a breed of small, black flying insect that relishes the opportunities we presented for access to human blood. They do appear insignificant, more on the scale of a midge from the Scottish Highlands than the usual fighter-bomber Mediterranean mosquito, but don't be fooled. They are just as nasty. A pharmacy was pleased to relieve us of €7.50 for a small tube of antihistamine - how we wished we'd taken the DEET from home and avoided the problem completely. The little swine were pretty well ubiquitous, but were especially active in the Boboli Gardens.(2) DEMENTED PUBLIC SERVANTSThe Continental tradition of over-employment in public services was evident. On entry to a museum one is taken through airport-style security, usually staffed by one more person than is necessary. No problem to the visitor (except that s/he is paying their salary) - they do not provide additional vigilance, merely solace to colleagues who may feel in need of a chat. Next comes the matter of buying a ticket. On one occasion we approached the kiosk, to be given a slip of paper that entitled us to buy a ticket at the appropriate counter. Mostly, though, one just buys a ticket in the normal way. This is then presented to another official a yard or two away who scrutinises it and admits you. Then past other officials seated on chairs, doing puzzles or chatting. Their function is unclear until the point at which the visitor, lost because of the lack of signage, doubles back to where he came from. Immediately urgent cries will attempt to arrest his progress. If he has any sense, he feigns problems of hearing or comprehension ('Iceland, no English' does the trick nicely). They do give up, eventually.Photography is universally forbidden indoors. I understand why in the presence of paintings, but am at a loss to see why a dose of UV would cause a bronze or marble statue to crumble.Post office clerks will refuse to deal with you until you have acquired a number. We were unable to see how to do that. None of the natives did it and simply formed an orderly queue in the usual way.In accordance with a culture that has a Polizia Idrologica, there are wardens to stop you from eating out-of-doors as one does in a tourist city: the dreaded 'Invigilizia Ambiente' (I may have spelled that wrongly) who respond noisily but at last with a shrug to the 'Iceland' trick (qv). I imagine their appointment is due to a desire to give work to the otherwise unemployable as well as supplying pigeons with as few crumbs to eat as possible. In accordance with that assumption we ate carefully.(3) NASTY ANTI-TOURIST POLICIESThe Uffizi is overcrowded with petty officialdom whose job in life is to refuse to allow you to re-enter doors you have passed through seconds before and requiring you to make a lengthy back-track. The sole justification would be to maintain a one-way system when it's busy, but when we went it was not especially so.At the entrance is a sign refusing entry to anyone carrying drinks. The matter of how you are supposed to survive in their inadequate ventilation for several hours without one is not addressed. Anyway, I left my drink in my rucksack. It was picked up on the scanner and I was required to drink from it to demonstrate its harmlessness. No problem there, but if I had obeyed the earlier signs I would have become dehydrated rather quickly.Relief is to be had from the rooftop cafe - at a considerable price. A coffee cost €4 seated, and you do need to sit. When I was last there 14 years ago people sat on the stone surround to the terrace - now it is fenced off with prohibition signs. There can be no reason, it's just to force you into the highly-profitable cafe (no doubt some specious ElfinSafety case would be cited but it will be twaddle). So, take food and drink with you to the Uffizi and defeat the anti-visitor Nazis who run it.All the guidebooks mention the convenience of buying timed tickets in advance. What neither of ours said was that this costs €4 for each ticket!(4) RIP-OFF TAXISWe arrived by train at Santa Maria Novella station and went to the rank for a taxi to our hotel. The meter ticked up nicely for the seven minutes the journey took to a total of €8, quite OK, I thought - but then the driver hit a button and it doubled to €16. I paid up and only later realised that he had probably pressed something that allowed him to charge double after midnight (eg). It was 4pm, by the way. I'd advise asking for an indicative fare before going aboard. On the way back we used a bus - highly convenient and it cost €1.20 each. Next time I'll get the hotel to give me a routeing using the bus (tickets from hotel receptions or tobacconists). Don't forget to stamp your ticket on entry to the bus, thus cancelling it.(5) AT LAST, A NICE SURPRISEI found that my EU passport demonstrating my venerable age (over 65) got me in free almost everywhere and cheaply in most other places. There are variious categories who can benefit, including teachers in possession of some EU card certifying their status. That saved us lots!And, as ever, overcoming inhibitions and trying out your odd bit of Italian works wonders, even if by mutual consent you immediately switch to English. To my mind, that displays respect for a culture from which my own sprang and to which they are closer.Except for officialdom we found people charming and helpful. Floreat Firenze!(6) CONCLUSIONThe Italian view, demonstrated in so many avenues of their public and diplomatic life, that rules are for mugs, is one to adopt. Ignore the signs and do as you please. If it really matters the officials will pounce and you'll have to comply, but most of the time do like the natives - what suits you best."
50,"“Day Tripping from Florence to Cinque Terre, Milan, and Venice”","Florence served as an excellent base for us to visit Cinque Terre, Milan, and Venice - even for day trips. We saved money by purchasing regionale and intercity train tickets using the machines at the SMN train station, which features English for fast, easy, clear, purchases. To get to Cinque Terre, we took spent just 8 euros taking the regionale train from SMN to Pisa Centrale to Sarzanna to Monterosso and did the same thing going back. To get to Milan, we took an ICN morning train for about 22.50 euros, and a faster train back (which costed more, 47 euros). To Venice, we took a fast train there, the ES (for about 30 euros) and a slightly slower train back. Some say you can't do day trips to those places, but we did and had about 8 hours to at least do the main things we wanted to do in those cities. It was great!"
50,“Florence & Tuscany”,"My wife and I took a ten day trip to Italy for our 3rd anniversary from September 17th to September 27th 2009. We spent 3 days in Rome, 4 in Florence and 2 in Venice. We had a good time in the other cities but Florence and the Tuscany region were by far what we enjoyed the most. We arrived in Florence at the Santa Maria Novella train station and walked with our luggage to our hotel on via Nazionale, Hotel Carravaggio. The accomodations were fine and the location was in close proximity to the train station. Our first day we visited the Church of Santa Maria Novella then had lunch at Ristorante Leonardo. We toured the Medici-Ricardi Palace on our own and then walked to the Duomo area for photographs. We walked through the Duomo and then headed up the 460 something steps to the top of the dome for a spectacular view of Florence. The top of the dome was a great spot for photos and to get a good idea of the cities landmarks. After we descended the steps we toured the Museum of the Duomo and thoroughly enjoyed it.Our second day in Florence we toured the monks cells in the Museum of San Marco and then took a guided tour of the Accademia and saw the David. We headed to the Church of San Lorenzo next and visited the Medici chapels after we walked through the church. We enjoyed shopping in the market nearby for scarves and souvenirs. We browsed and shopped our way to the Oltarno for dinner at La Galleria.Our third day in Florence we walked through the food market and made our way to the Uffizi Gallery. We took a guided tour of the Uffizi to see the highlights and then we were off to the Santa Croce Church. My wife enjoyed shopping in this area for leather handbags while I took photographs by the church. The church was undergoing some renovations and it was actually neat to see the frescoes and the floor being carefully restored. We really enjoyed walking through the leather school and talked with the artisans there. We bought some journals and had them engraved by the staff which made great personalized souvenirs.The next day we headed to the train station to board our bus for a Best of Tuscany Tour. This was one of the highlights of our trip because the landscapes were beautiful, the food and wine was great and we covered a ton of ground. Our guide, which we found can really make or break your experience, was excellent and our first stop was Siena. We toured the cathedral and Campo and had about 30 minutes to walk around on our own. Next we headed to a Vineyard/Farm for a quick tour and lunch with wine and an amazing view of San Gimignano in the distance. We then spent an hour or so wandering San Gimignano which had great views and excellent gelato. After the seeing medieval town we boarded the tour bus and took another scenic drive to Pisa. We headed straight to the Field of Miracles for the typical ""Hold the Tower Up Picture"" and wandered through the nearby market and shops. We were back on the bus shortly and headed back to Florence. After a long day and a ton of great sites we both agreed that Tuscany was our favorite part of a great trip. We would love to go back and spend more time in that region of Italy."
50,“Beautiful City and Beautiful Countryside”,Situated on the Arno river this city give you everything you could want. You have all the cultural attractions and benefits of a city and yet if you go 10 minutes in either direction along the river you will be struck by the beautiful rolling hills and countryside. The people who live here are so very special. They are warm and hospitable and will make your visit even more memorable. If you only have one museum to visit go to the Accademia and Michelangelo's David. This is one piece that lives up to the hype. You'll never go hungry with the many fantastic places to eat and if you make it to the Mercato Centrale find a stand and try a Tripe sandwich. They're delicious.
50,“A Magical Place”,"Florence for 8 days was a wonderful experience. My husband and I rented a flat in the Otrarno district just across the Arno. We were within walking distance of central Florence and did alot of it. About 15 miles per day. The city is very accessible because it is not that large and we feel like we covered almost every square inch of it!We started out each morning, stopping by a local bakery for a fantastic pastry and cappuccino. Quickly we adopted the tradition of napping in the mid-afternoon and then starting out again later in the day and usually staying out until 11PM. The city felt safe and was well lit. We were never afraid and were only rarely approached by a street person.The people were helpful and many spoke a little English, which was great. We had fun trying to communicate and had some hilarious moments.We would have no reservations about returning to this wonderfully historic city. The art is breathtaking and moved me to tears more than once. One of the real gem of the city lies in the outlying neighborhoods, where we were able to walk among the locals and shop in their little markets and street stalls, see the children returning from school and the older people gathered on park benches feeding pidgeons and talking."
50,“Fabulous Firenze (Florence)”,"Florence is a magical must-see. It is filled with energy, artwork, shops, catherdral (the Duomo is magnificent), palaces, piazzas...and it is definitely a walking city. You find magic down each street. Forget maps and let yourself get lost! I highly recommend it. The people are friendly and helpful. The food is amazing - from simple panini to gourmet meals - you will not be disappointed. Visit the statue of David (the real one, not the many fakes). Take a Vespa tour (book through Florencetown and ask for Georgia) into the Tuscan countryside. It was the best part of our ten days in Tuscany."
50,"“Florence, Italy”","My boyfriend and I traveled through Italy and we did not expect much from Florence, but when we got there, we were amazed! Around every turn there was something new and exciting to see and appreciate. It is an amazing city with so much to offer. Lots of history and culture. We were very impressed and wish that we had planned more time to explore the city."
40,“Firenze”,"I studied in Florence ten years ago and the city has not changed one bit. It's so beautiful, though I wish that the Italians would take better care of their buildings and streets. So dirty! Definately recommend going here, if only to sit and stare at the David!"
50,“My Florence”,"I never, ever get tired of Florence. It's like walking around in a huge open-air museum and almost every street offers a peek at the incredible and iconic Duomo. Its magnificent dome watches over the city and its visitors and always looks to me like it's just been sitting there and waiting for me arrive.The shopping cannot be beat in Florence and the food is incredible. Take the time to stop at Pork's Restaurant in the Mercato Centrale and order the tortolini. The staff is very friendly and kind and you'll feel like an old friend when you take a seat."
50,“My Favorite City in Italy”,"Took my first trip to Italy in the fall of 2007, started the trip off with 3 days in Rome, then 3 days in Venice, 3 days in Florence and 2 days back in Rome. The trip was amazing, each city offerred something unique; Rome the Vatican City, Colloseum and Forum, Venice the canals, and Florence the museums, churches and countryside of Tuscany. The surprising highlight of my trip was the city of Florence. In Florence everything was within easy walking distance and the myriad of shops, cafe's, museums, and historical monuments were outstanding. Another plus was the ability to do a short side trip from Florence to the city of Pisa and a climb up the Leaning Tower. Would recommend an Italy trip to anyone and certainly would encourage you to see all 3 cities, but if you have to choose a city don't shortchange Florence. As a tip I found that 3-4 days in each city would give you enough time to see most of the city's attractions."
50,“My favorite”,"Florence is a beautiful and easy to navigate city for tourists. You miss the busy-ness of the bigger towns, like Rome and can walk almost anywhere! The Ponte de Vecchio bridge is a wonderful place to look for nice jewelery and the Duomo is a wonderful cathedral to visit. We were able to go to a church service and the priest was wonderful!"
50,“My Adventure in Italy”,"What an amazing place! This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, going to the city I've dreamed of ever since I started studying art in college (a few decades ago).The Hotel Berchielli was everything I'd hoped it would be - quiet, classy and very convenient to the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi and the Palazzo Pitti. And the breakfast buffet was marvelous.I had wonderful guides in the museums and during a great bus trip to Siena and San Gimignano.I'd also recommend:the Weekend in Florence Web site, where I booked all my attractions ticketsthe Florence Open Tour, hop-on, hop-off bus excursionthe Trattoria Ponte Vecchio for its marvelous food and perfect service and atmosphereI'd go back and do everything the same in a heartbeat."
40,“Under the Tuscan Sky”,"Tuscany was absolutely beautiful! If you're staying in Florence I would advise you to take advantage of the wine tours and day tours that will take you out of Florence and into the beautiful countryside of Tuscany, San Gimignano, Pisa and Siena. But if you're more of a city person, you will be in awe of the Paizza del Michelangelo , the Duomo, and the museums in Florence. Don't go back home until you've seen the Uffizi.I was there on my honeymoon and it was absolutely magical!"
40,"“Best art in the world, but not my favorite city”","You can say that once you have seen the art in Florence, there is no reason to return here. And if you have visited Rome, there is no need to spend more than 2 days in Florence. I found the city to be really dirty, noisy and need a lot of improvements. The Piazzas are nothing like the ones in Rome, and I found the city to be really dirty.You go to Florence to see the David from Michalangelo, the Pietta, the sculptures, but the city isn't that nice. After you have seeing St. Peters in Rome, the Duomo in Milan, St. Marks in Venice, you don't need to see the Duomo in Florence, it is horrible. There are a couple of streets that are nice, like the street that goes to Ponte Vecchio, and Piazza de la Republica is nice as well. Overall, I would spend more time in a city like Rome, Assisi or Venice, than in Florence. Make sure that you make reservations to the Uffizi and Academia before going, if not, you will be on the line for a long time. We made all our reservations before going to italy and we saved a lot of time by just showing up and getting into the museums right away."
40,“Beautiful city..but be aware of some charges...”,"Love Florence but be aware of taking taxis. If you have a Hotel or restaurant call one for you, they charge for the time it takes to get to you. They are VERY expensive!Also, if you travel by rail or bus, be aware of "" validation"" requirement for all tickets. Tickets must be purchased and additionally validate by a machine, or you will be charged a very, very large penalty as we unfortunately were. We were not given the information when we bought our ticket with the english speaking ticket desk."
50,“Florence - what magnificence!”,"My wife and I visited Florence for three busy days in August. We packed in as much of what Florence has to offer as we could, we loved it.Florence provided the best ice creams that we experienced in Italy, having also been to Rome and Venice. We read what wikitravel had to offer on Florence and would agree that Perche No! is the best gelateria in the city.If you would like to sample the magnificent Renaissance artwork on a budget just pop in to any church in the city. Every church that we visited in Florence contained excellent artwork.We attended mass in the Ognisanti church and would recommend the experience to others that are so inclined.Galleria degli Uffizi; the Uffizi contains so much fantastic art that it is difficult to take it all in. A definite must-see attraction even for those not too keen on art.Palazzo Pitta; we decided to buy tickets for the Boboli gardens and modest art collections rather than for the Medici collection as it was a hot but beautiful day. The gardens are amazing and provide simply stunning views of Florence and the Tuscan hills. In particular the view from the Belvedere in the Bardini gardens, adjacent to the Boboli gardens is magnificent.Santa Maria del Fiore/ Duomo di Firenze; if you can tolerate the long queues, scrounging Romany gypsies as well as illegal street traders nearby then visit the Duomo because it is free. I think that the outside is more impressive than the inside but it is worth a visit nonetheless.The Baptistry near the Duomo is worth a look at 4 euros each. The golden doors at the rear are spectacular and worth a few pictures, if you can elbow your way through the hordes of fellow camera-wielding tourists.As a couple of newlyweds in our mid-twenties my wife and I enjoyed Florence hugely and would visit the city and region again."
40,“A family florentine holiday”,"We loved visiting Florence. We booked through apartments-florence-italy.com and had a very helpful service. Our apartment on via Cavour was just right for us, it was close to all the things you need to see, but also close to the student quarter so there's lots going on and some reasonably priced restaurants and places to eat. The mini mart on via Gualfa is great for cheap beer and Il Vegeteriana on via Ruote is great whether you a veggie or not. Three of us ate loads with wine for €35 which is amazing in Florence (very good too). Felt there wasn't as much for our 7 year old to do as we'd hoped, but she liked it and I recommend the playarea on Piazza dell'Indipendenza - a lovely green square - our daughter made lots of friends despite the language barrier. On via Cavour itself is a lovely toyshop, which our daughter wanted to visit daily (its the best toystore we've ever been to). Also there is a serial killer museum - totally fascinating if you like that sort of thing. Shop staff and 'ordinary' people are lovely, the only snotty types seemed to be in the big museums. The Mercado Centrale is just ace, we bought some fabulous food and everyone was really accommodating with our lack of Italian."
40,"“Lovely place, lots to see, a great cultural break”","We were staying at the nearby Norcenni Girasole (about half hour drive away) and parked for free at Piazzale Michelangelo to go and explore this lovely city. The skyline views from here are stunning. As it was so hot, we only took the children around the Duomo, Accademia and over the Ponte Vecchio. The David statue was amazing , such detail in the carving - though as there were 5 of us, the 10 Euros each entrance was a bit pricey. We were only here for half a day as our children wanted to get back to the swimming pools but we managed to see quite a lot in a short length of time."
20,“Beautiful but flawed”,"What more can be said about the beauty of this ancient city, that has not already been said?Breathtaking beauty, engaging historical sites, and an easily navigable city centre made Florence a joy to be in.There are however some downsides to this great city, and I must mention them. Pricing in restaurants, trattorias and other cafes appears to have increased sharply in recent years. I can't imagine it's for any reason other than simply taking advantage of tourists' willingness to accept such exorbitance. The eatieres situated within sight of the Palazzo Vecchio and other city centre attractions are certainly enthusiastic about standing at kerbsides to attract your custom, but I must say that standards of service have certainly dropped of late. Nonchallance and dismissal are commonplace amongst many of the waiting staff we encountered, and many were quite simply just downright hostile and rude to the many tourists. My and my fellow travellers' ability to converse freely in Italian was usually met with disapproval by serving staff who would quite simply just cut you off and speak in English. It was insulting and unneccessary and I cannot understand their attitude. Perhaps they were just sick and tired of having to speak English to the many; my point being that when a guest in your country honours you by speaking fluently in your language, then it seems apparent to me that you should indulge the time and effort to which the have gone to learn it.The greatest marker we had for the poor quality of service was to hear staff at one particular city restaurant speak amongst themselves, to state that ""Florence was over tourism!"" No more needs said on that matter I think. The worst we encountered was a cafe on the Via Maralla (if spelling serves). One young waiter there was simply so rude, that I ended up going to the counter and asking just what his problem was with tourists. He swore freely in Italian to his friends about those he believed to be tourists, not imagining for one moment that some of them might understand him. In this instance, a Scots accent and barrel chest had the desired effect and he came out to apologise, but the damage was done by this point.I've spoken freely about the appalling downside to Florence, but it remains a destination I would recommend for a short stay and first time trip to an Italian city. It has beauty and elegance in abundance, and some of the treats to be found involving local arts and events, including the opera performances, are simply exquisite! Go off the beaten track and discover some fabulous performances by local artists. Ask at your hotel for guidance.The bustling crowds and overpriced entries to museums, galleries, palaces, and eating establishments aside, it' still a great place to see. Standards have definitely dropped in recent years to simply appalling levels, and the smell of urine from the city streets is disgusting. Initially it appears equine, apparent from the many horses around on which to tour town; but quickly becomes recognisable as human. One local friend informed us it was resultant of the city refuse collectors openly urinating in the city streets in the absence of night opening lavatories! The smell in 38C heat wasn't pleasant. That about sums up latter day Firenze; beautiful but completely flawed."
50,“Wine Tasting with Nathalie”,"My wife and I recently returned from a twelve day vacation to Italy (July 24th – August 4th). We were part of a tour group of 40 people visiting Venice, Florence, Rome and Sorrento. While parts of our tour we’re planned, we also had a good amount of free time to spend as we liked.High on my list during the planning stage of our trip was a wine tasting and ride through the Chianti region of Tuscany. After looking into the cost I found that booking ahead with a tour company could be quite expensive. It was then that I decided to look at tripadvisor.com to see what other people have done and how they rated their experience. This is how I came upon Nathalie [ --XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-- ]. Everything I read about Nathalie was just what I was looking for so I went ahead and contacted her.I emailed Nathalie and she promptly responded that she was available during our stay in Florence. Nathalie was very accommodating during the whole process. She was up front with the costs and able to meet all of our needs. I should add that the cost was significantly less than what the tour companies offered. I’m sure this has to do with the fact that she’s able to rely on word of mouth for advertisement. In the end we arranged to meet in Florence and take the tour.When the day of our tour arrived it became apparent that we would be late arriving in Florence. I called Nathalie and explained our predicament. I find being late to be very stressful but Nathalie made my day when she said not to be worried. She changed her arrangements and picked us up at our hotel. She also rearranged the tour to make sure we got the full tour. I can’t thank her enough for that.As for the tour itself I don’t want to say too much. Everyone should experience it for themselves. Suffice it to say that Tuscany is beautiful. Nathalie took us to wonderful places. The sights, wine tasting and foods we enjoyed were spectacular. Not to be outdone by her surroundings, Nathalie was also exceptional. The stories and insights into the region that she shared with us were more than we could have hoped for.I’d compare her tour to a similar experience we had in Sorrento one week later. Seven of us had dinner at a restaurant called L’ Antica Trattoria. The food was excellent, but the waiter Tony made it into one of the most memorable meals of my life. I’ve never laughed and had so much fun during a meal.Bottom line, if you’re looking for an affordably priced top notch tour guide you can trust, Nathalie is the person for you. Nathalie’s able to charge less than other tour operators because she relies on word of mouth from satisfied customers for advertisement. Count me as an exceptionally satisfied customer. I have no problem taking time out from my day to write this after the wonderful time she showed us in Tuscany."
50,“Back from Florence- thoughts on restaurants and tours”,"My husband and I spent 5 nights in Florence this July. It was wonderful. We really enjoyed staying at the Excelsior on the Arno. We took several fabulous tours.TOURS-When I was in Florence 7 years ago I hired Cristina Mariani and she was so wonderful we hired her again this visit. she took us through the Uffizi, Academia and the Pitti Palace. She is so knowledgeable- she works in the winter in the uffizi. she charges 60Euro per hour. we hired her for 3 hours on each of 2 days. Her contact information is [--].We took the Fiat 500 Tours for a drive around the city and into the countryside for a picnic at a lovely winery. we were the only 2 on tour that day. Meg led us in the car in front. My husband loved driving the fiat and the tour was relaxing and beautiful after 9 days of museums, galleries and churches. If you are looking for something different- this is it! Prices vary depending on the type of tour you take. You can find more information on TA and they have their own website. sophie is the owner and very lovely.The next day we took a wine tour of Chianti with Nathalie. We had the good fortune of running into Alessandro and his couple at one of the wineries. So, we got an extensive tour ofone the winerys from both of them. It is my opinion that you can't go wrong with either one of them. They refer to each other when one is busy. We originally contacted Alessandro and he referred us to [--]. Both are frequently mentioned on this site. She charged 230 euro for a full day 9-4:30.RESTAURANTS-The first night we went to Trattoria Cibrea- great food! I went to their white table cloth restaurant 7 years ago so I was anxious to try their trattoria. The same good food, more casual atmosphere and about 1/3 the price. They don't take reservations so show up by 8:45.They only take CASH . I bottle of wine , 2 waters, 4 anti pasto and 4 seconds was 77EuroLunch for 2 at Osteria del Porcellino (near the uffizi and Santa Croce) was recommended by Cristina and it was very good. We had one squid salad, one tuna and vegetable plate, one cheese plate and 2 waters for 31 Euro. They also advertised 2 course specials and water for 12 euro per person.We had dinner at Quattro Leone and it was good except that I would not order the house wine and I would request outdoor seating. I know this place gets mixed reviews on TA but it was recommended by 2 of the tour guides (Meg had her wedding reception there) and we enjoyed it.We had salad with figs, cheeses and salami, beef slices w/ orange, chicken and spinach and house wine for 57 EurosCammillo- located very close to Quattro Leone. Our meal was 79 Euro for water, 1/2 bottle chianti, veal chop, salmon, spinach, melon with prosciutto. The interior was very cute and the food very good.Sostanza-Cash only and the food was very good. However, for me the atmosphere was a turnoff- very shabby- not chic. The fun part was the communal table- we sat with a lovely couple from Switzerland that comes there often as they have a second home in Florence. We had one buttered chicken, steak, greenbeans and a fabulous dessert- meringues- don't miss it if you dine there. We also had house wine that was not very good. the bill was 70 Euro.The most fun dinner we had in florence was acqua al 2. It is very hip and filled with young people. They have another location in San Diego. Their house wine was delicious! We shared a trio of salads, 2 sets of the 5 pasta from chefs choice and one peppercorn filet. The food, atmosphere and wine was great for 57 euro. Instead of the 5 pasta sampler I would just get 2 pasta dishes and share. The chef choice of 5 pastas had different types of sauces and pastas but not much with the pasta- seafood or vegetables , etc. I think you would do better by splitting 2 pastas of your choice.My 2 favorites in Florence would be trattoria Cibrea and Acqua al 2.!Florence was even warmer than Rome!"
50,"“Florence, A must see”","I have just returned from my holiday in Florence and had to advise others on what an excellent place it is. It was filled with amazing architecture, for example the Duomo, i had a shock when i saw its brilliant detail that took 140 years to build. There are also alot of churches to be seen around the city, some you have to pay to get into some you don't.A museum that i visited was called Palazzo strozzi, it was about Galileo's life and what he had done throughout his life. It showed painting of his work and also an in depth study of the astronomy that he focused his life on. When i was there they were giving out free audio guides which came in very useful for understanding some of the artwork.The shops around the city are exquisite, but be prepared to pay alot of money for most items, including Italien leather and the cds and games don't come in cheap over there either. If you are looking to buy souvenirs and are touring the rest of the country then your best bet is to keep your money until you get to Pisa where the prices are a few euros cheaperAll of the restuarants that i visited were delightful, i didn't have one bad meal, and if you enjoy ice cream, pizza and pasta this is definetely the place for you."
50,“I Love Florence”,"Last May I visited Florence in Italy. I loved it. It is my fave city in Europe. I stayed at a really lovely hotel near the Accademia, where David is. I was so impressed because the hotel was just across the piazza from my favourite statue on the planet. Even my boyfriend Peter is jealous of 'David' . That is why he stayed in London. Aside from that Florence has so much to offer in the way of culture, so many galleries, museums and the like. It was fab. Something else really nice about Florence was that the people there are so friendly. I love Florence and recommend the whole world to go there. Im am so gonna miss Europe when I get home again."
50,“Climb the Stairs at the Duomo”,"If you are capable, climb the few hundred stairs up the Duomo. It is so worth the view of Florence. It is a beautiful church and a wonderful, breathtaking view. Since it is a church, please be respectful of what you wear, No short or tank tops."
50,“Florence Trip Report”,"Florence is everything you have ever dreamed!We had set aside on 3 days for Florence and surprisingly that was just the perfect amount of time. A huge time save was buying tickets in advance, online for the Uffzi Museum. When we arrived at the museum the line was 50 yards long, but we walked right to the front of the line with our advanced tickets.Once inside the museum, it is pretty hard to get lost, the museum is mostly made up of rooms off of halls at right angles. After our experience in Rome, we debated over hiring a guide in Florence and decided to give the Uffizi a try on our own with our DK guidebook.We managed to see all the major highlights that were on our check list within an hour. This included Bottocelli's Birth of Venus and the Premivera. There was also Caravaggio's Madusa bowl, Adoration of the Magi, Leonardo da Vinciand Madonna with the Goldfinch by Raphael.However, this place was a treasure trove of other works that would have been more enjoyable with a private guide. Unlike Rome, all of the artwork in the Uffizi had those little signs next to each piece describing the artist, date and with a bit of history,The next day we visited the Acadamia to see Michealangelo's David. There was no line to get in the museum at 10am and good for us, because we had not purchased advanced tickets for this sight. For me the highlight of this museum were the unfinished sculptures of Michealangelo called the Prisoners, because the unfinished works make the figures look like they are trying to escape from the rock. But the joy for me was seeing his chisel marks and the peek at his works that were in progress.Some great restaurants that we enjoyed were: Antico Noe and the Cantinetta Antinori, although the latter was a bit pricey, it was wonderful food and service.Things to watch out for, It seemed like there were more pedestrian areas compared to other Italian cities, but the number of gypsies were no different and you get this uneasy feeling that you have o keep a close eye on your bag at all times."
10,“Not a friendly place!”,"I recently travelled to Europe, for 2 months, with my family (children 11 and 14) and we had an amazing time.....except Florence! It is the only place we have all said we would not return too. Why? Well firstly the people were not very friendly and often rude. The city is expensive esp. when THEY CHARGE CHILDREN FULL PRICE for museums etc AND not just full price BUT DOUBLE normal price. That is, we poor unfortunates that don't live in an EU country get CHARGED DOUBLE!!!! Don't they like tourists in Florence...obviously not from non-EU countries!!!Don't go there! This is my second visit to the city. I was there 18 years ago and didn't like it then, but couldn't remember why I didn't like the place, so thought we'd give it another go. I wish now we'd used that valuable time in other places like extra time in Rome or Cinque Terre. They are amazing places, and tourist friendly!The only good thing was the great hostel..Archie Rossi (see my review)."
50,“Unforgettable trip to Tuscany. Thanks Viandando!”,"I have just been to Tuscany, one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited.Thanks to Viandando we had our best trip ever. We spent 10 days traveling around, visiting amazing places such as Lucca, Siena, Pienza, the unknown Crete Senesi and the wild area of Maremma.Viandando organized a great cooking class in the Chianti, a bike tour on Lucca's medieval walls and a wine tour in the boutique wineries of Maremma with tasting of superb wines and local products.Thanks for making our holiday in Tuscany so memorable!Brenda & C."
50,“so much art so little time to see it all”,loved Florence so many wonderful things to see . Culture and history at every turnDO :-1. get pre booked tickets for Ufizzi and Acadamia in summer the story about the queing is true we did ours through ticketitaly2. Walk up to Piazza Michaelangelo in the day and at night for the view3. Do the Campanile Not the Duomo dome as the walk is easier no queus and the sight of the dome from thatt height is amazing4. Do the Pitti palazzo in the afternoon it is quieter and the ceilings are amazing5. Do the Ponti vecchio bridge from the bridge opposite to get the full effect as it is really tatty close up6. wear comfy shoes and enjoy every stepDont:-1. Buy any icecreams near pont vechio unless you want to pay 9 euros same for anyhing else.2. Be suprised at how tacky that part is but the rest of Oltarno is lovely3.forget that cofee is a pleasure in Italy so drink lots especially proper capuccino4.Forget to read the menu for the prices as a nasty shock can occur when you get carried away with the courses
20,“Another souvenir from Florence”,"I just got my surprise in the mail from the Polizia Municipale in Florence 9 months after my trip. My trip included a one day, 6 hour trip from Florence to the Chianti area. Rented a car only one time in Italy and lo and behold a 102 euro fine. After translating the ticket and reading various postings it seems I inadvertently strayed into a lane for public transportation on Via Senese. To say that I was a little apprehensive about driving in Italy, after extensive driving in England and Ireland, is an understatement. I was wary of going into the restricted zones of Florence and tried to obey all the signage. I knew that leaving Florence on my drive would not be too hard but I was worried about getting back into Florence and finding the rental agency. I was occupied with finding the proper roads to get to the bridge that would get me to the rental agency and obviously missed the sign restricting my travel. During my drive back I tried to make sure that I was following other cars as I tried to find the right roads but the cameras got me. I'm a little upset about getting the ticket in the first place 9 months after my trip but the excessive amount of the fine is ridiculous. When this ticket came I was in the middle of planning another trip to Italy, this time to the south of Naples. Now, I would not give that country another nickel of my money. If this is the way they treat visitors then they'll not get anymore of my money. So, I'll pay my 102 euro fine but the airline, the hotels, the restaurants, and the tour companies will not get the thousands of dollars I would have spent. France, here I come."
40,“My favourite place in Italy”,"I like all Italy., because there live very kind and funny people , too much beautiful places and good weather always.I like art, architecture of Florence. There was so wonderful that I felt happy myself. I very like to paint (because I left art and music school) and want to paint there my pictures. Therefore I'll come back there again. And you?"
50,“a different point of view..”,"Last year I got the chance to experience an intimate short ""cruise"" on the Arno River .On a small boat holding a maximum of 12 people ( without engine!! ) we sailed Florence river for about a mile : in the meantime a licesed guide on board was giving historical/art info and told us interesting stories about the city past..it was just amazing to see Florence from a different point of view!!didn't even know that it was possible.."
50,“A gem in the heart of Florence”,We arrived at this gem pretty late in the evening and very tired from our excursions and were greeted as if we were family. We were shown into our (American sized) room and right away we felt at home. The location was first rate. The room was first class. And Tommaso helped us with every little detail to maximize our stay. We will stay here again the next time that we are in Florence and we will readily recommend it to any friend who will be traveling to Florence.
50,"“Tuscan in Tour - Florence, Italy”","We booked our Florence, Italy tour with Tuscany in Tour in June, 2009 and it was a wonderful experience working with this company. They provided a driver, Massimo, that took us to the two main museums in Florence and provided information about the history of the city and the city itself. Massimo spoke excellent English and had a good sense of humor. He was patient and kind and went out of his way to show us what a spectacular city Florence really is. I would absolutely recommend this company if you are traveling to Florence, Italy. This company will specialize your Itinerary and provide a detailed service that you will enjoy for your entire trip.Massimo provided a special touch for all of us to have a memorable vacation and left all of us wanting to come back to this beautiful city again soon. This was the best tour company we have used when traveling to Florence."
50,“Amazing Place!”,"I have read about Tuscany in one very popular magazine. there also i found an information about tour agency situated in Florence, called Viandando! After writing mail to them, this agency suggested me a perfect trip to Tuscany, including visiting of 9 citiies, which are not touristic but very nice, excelent hotels, very cosy and luxury, the list of best restaurants in this region and the 24 hours assistence in every question. They made a perfect trip for me and my husband! I love Italy and espesially Tuscany!"
20,“Florence is a beautiful city but be careful!!”,"Our first four days in Florence were like a dream! It is a magnificent city. Then, oops, I fell on a stair. I knew I was in trouble when I was transported to the ER in a Fiat ambulance. It was downhill from there (so to speak). Anyway, to make a long story short I fractured my heel (calcaneous) and the ER said I had a severe sprain.I knew it was fractured because I heard it crack - found out for sure when we got to an Ortho in New York. The medical treatment was substandard sorry to say. (No ice, elevation, or compression) They told me I was non-weight bearing on that leg and sent my husband down the street to buy crutches (they don't have them in the hospital). Bottom line, the rest of our stay was a nightmare. Accidents can happen anywhere and it certainly isn't the city of Florence's fault. (Although the stair I didn't see was black and there was no light) Where was my spelunking headlight when I needed it? My advice is to carry a roll of duct tape in your bag just in case you have an accident in Florence. I couldn't find the translation for duct tape in my pocket dictionary. Hope you have better luck."
50,“One week Itinerary for Florence”,"Hello everyone.Over March break, I planned out a one week itinerary to Florence. What an incredible and amazing city. I highly recommend visiting it. The art, the food, the people! Everything blew me away.At any rate, here is my one week itinerary if you are interested!http://www.ehow.com/how_5024867_plan-long-itinerary-florence-italy.html"
40,“Charming Florence”,Florence is a romantic city full of Artand all main historical sites are close to each otherthat it is a nice walk. Also the train station is located 15 minutes (walking time) far from the Duomo.Also typical cuisine is a must!I enjoyed a lot my stay in this lovely city where you can breatheArt everywhere.
40,"“Thought it was Romantic, but proved to be VERY touristic.”","May 2009 - We just managed to come back from Florence, so i would like to share some experiences/details:- We spend three nights in Florence, in Hotel Ballestri.Really nice location, alot of sightseeing in general and many hidden-gems. Either small shops or bars/cafes around the city.- We were not prepared for the big queues, so we spend 2 hours waiting to go in Galleria Academia ( 6,5 euros)....Prebooked tickets, would save us 2 hours but not 4 extra euros, 10,5 euros/each the ticket...We expected more than ""David"" and some other statues/sculptures that justify the 6,5 euros and the 2 hours of waiting....- We didnt have the chance to visit Uffizi, since the queues were HUGE.- Palazzo Pitti and the gardens are nice, but still the 10 euros entrance are not logical.- The Panoramic Terrace next to Duomo, took us30 minutes waiting40 minutes going up the 414 dangerous steps (really narrow stairs).15 minutes going down6 euros each.Reward? the View of Florence only.- There are more interesting sights to see,inside Duomo, Santa Croce, watch the sunset in Piazzale Michelangiolo, walk on Ponte Vecchio bridge, or just wander around the many Florence alleys.- The city in general is very expensive...examples:2.5 - 3 euros for a 1/2 liter water.15 euros for 2 cafes and a small water in Piazza Duomo.4 euros for a can of Coca Cola.pizza changing price from 6-9 euros in the same place!!!(different price for Saturday compared to Friday!!!)However, there are many restaurants around Duomo or hidden in the city where they make special offers, lunch/dinner for 8-10 euros.The food in general was average.- Don't miss trying pizza from some local ""forno"" (bakeries),where they sell 1.4 euros the 100 grams.The downtown at night, offers many street performers, which is nice and adds a special essence to the scenery.- Shopping. - VERY expensive in generalDON'T be mislead, and buy in the price they offer.i bought 2 ""Firenze"" T-shirts/souvenirs 12 euros, with a 24 euros starting price.Try to do your shopping in the last days, so you can compare prices.In general, we felt that people lie to us and face us not as human but as MONEY..Example from a seller:""This 100% leather bag is my production from my factory, that's why it costs only 150 euros"".We saw the same bag 1 hour ago in a street-seller, for 60 euros!!! (even 60 euros seemed soooo much for a -mass production- not sure if leather- bag.).So, you will easily see the same things in shops and sold in streets also!!!IN CASE THAT, you really like something, try to make a market research and to bargain ALOT, before buying.GENERAL CONCLUSION:Apart from the high prices in every step we made, Florence is very beautiful and romantic. There are many hidden gems, many hidden places which are worth being explored.Try to avoid some of the mistakes, we/most people made, and i mention above.I would go in Florence again, but the 2nd time i would be more careful and know where to go and what activities to do."
50,“My Favorite Restaurants in Florence! Enjoy!”,"I am just about to return from a 5-week trip to Florence, and I wanted to share my restaurant experiences. I did my research carefully before I left (and while I was there), so I can't say that I had any affirmatively bad meals. However, I definitely recommend certain places above others. Below I have listed those places I highly recommend (i.e., that I would return to) and then those places that I ate at and thought were good but not exceptional (I would not necessarily return to these). I have also noted in parentheses any special features or notable things about each restaurant (i.e., what to order, if it's primarily a lunch spot, etc.):Highly recommended:-Za-Za (touristy but still good and worth a visit; anything with truffle sauce is good)-Il Pizzaiuolo (fabulous pizza; reservations required)-Cibreino (they do not take reservations; get there are 7 to avoid a wait; order the yellow pepper soup, the polenta, the chicken meatballs, the raw branzino (AMAZING!), and the chocolate cake--although I think everything here is fantastic)-Baldovino (another great pizza spot; this one is less touristy and regarded for some reason, but I thought it was just as good)-Sant'Agostino 23 (authentic; few tourists; Oltranrno)-Trattoria Quattro Leoni (the pear pasta probably has a million calories, but it is divine; make a reservation and try to sit outside if it's nice; Oltrarno)-Fuori Porta (light meal/lunch; great wine enoteca; Oltrarno)-La Casalinga (inexpensive; authentic; not much atmosphere-wise; make a reservation or get there early; Oltrarno)-I Fratellini (my go-to lunch spot; great, inexpensive panino and wine served from (literally) a hole in the wall; you have to eat standing up outside or sitting in a nearby doorway)-Munaciello (pizza; very trendy (but not in an annoying way), not in any of the guidebooks; younger crowd; reservations required; highly recommended; Oltrarno)-Borgo Antica (for a casual meal on a Piazza; not mind-blowing food, but decent and fun; Oltrarno)-Il Rufrillo (my favorite caffe in Florence; panino and pasta at lunchtime)-Cantinetta dei Verranzzano (lunch; fabulous focaccia bread; amazing little focaccia sandwiches and pizza with sit-down place attached)Other restaurants:-Trattoria Sostanza (the bistecca and the meringue dessert are amazing and probably worth a visit alone, but the pastas were really not good; reservations required for one of two seatings: 7:30 and 9)-Coquinarius (one of the few good places near the Duomo; if you can walk further, I think there are better places, but the pastas are healthy and creative, and they have salads!!)-Da Mario (rustic lunch spot; shared tables, brisk service; worth going once if you're in the area; the bistecca is supposedly very good here; I had a good pasta with wild boar sauce)-Del Fagioli (traditional Florentine dishes; no tourists)-Al Tranvai (inexpensive, traditional; no tourists)-I'Toscana (this is actually the one place I had a semi-negative experience; the entree I was served came with a side salad that was literally days old and disgusting; the ravioli with sage butter was delicious, though; ambiance here is lacking; not worth the money overall)-Moyo (aperitivi*; the best aperitivi selection of the three I went to while in Florence; crowd is young (lots of college students); ~6-8 euro)-Noir (aperitivi; older (30's), trendy crowd; great view if you get a table outside; ~10 euro)-Slowly (aperitivi; trendy; ~10 euro)-Il Cantadino (lunch; fixed price menu for lunch (~10 euro with wine) and dinner (~11 euro with wine); no ambiance; no tourists)-FrancescoVini (pizza; cute place but lots of tourists and much better pizza at Pizzauiolo and Baldovino (and others))* Aperitivi is when a bar offers free food (usually from about 7-9 p.m.) if you buy a cocktail (which is usually more expensive than it otherwise would be). It's a good deal as long as you only order one drink.Finally, as far as gelato, I think I became somewhat of a snob because I only ended up liking Vivoli and Gelateria dei Neri (Vivoli was my favorite). All of the other places just didn't compare."
50,"“A must see - Florence, and a must do - Segway Tour”","Florence is a wonderful city - best to stay right in the heart of the city so you can walk everywhere day and night - and one of the most fun things I have ever done is the Segway Tour of Florence - it was wonderful and is definitely the best way to see Florence - do this as soon as you arrive. Very, very informative - our guide Federica spoke excellent English and was just wonderful. Would totally recommend this tour as a great way to see the city of Florence - and money well spent. You have to do this - it was amazing. Don't forget to see the Salvatore Ferragamo Museum (if you are into shoes and who isn't) - he was a very talented man ahead of his time. Also did a day trip to Venice - if you are short on time - only 3 hours away - and you can book through your hotel concierge usually a day or so ahead."
40,“Beautiful but expesive”,Florence is a beautiful city full of culture and hidden gems.The only drawback for us is if you are looking to people watch with a coffee and/or a lager go elsewhere.If you are into churches and history and want to be thirsty you have hit the jackpot !!
50,“4 nights in Florence”,"Travelled to Pisa airport with Ryanair ,landed 20.00 and bought coach ticket in airport for 10 euro which was directly outside arrivals. One hour later arrived at Santa Maria Novella bus and train terminus in Florence. Taxi to Hotel Paris 500 metres but in dark so took no chances.Hotel position excellent, breakfast very nice,room clean with fab drapes and room 337 looks onto lit up Duomo in evening (brilliant). Florence is superb, took ""citysightseeing"" red bus around city for 20 euro and it was well worth it ! Best place we found was Pitti Palace but got sore neck looking at ceilings.... magnificent (12 euro) . Uffizi gallery was like first day of sales to begin with but calms down after 10 mins (14euro) . Enjoyed Uffizi but Pitti Palace better. Ponte Vecchio great place with amazing jewellery shops on bridge which wife liked to walk over several times.On return journey took train direct from S.M.Novella into Pisa airport (1hour 30 mins-5 euro) which gave us a view of countryside. You must stamp train ticket in yellow box in front of train before getting on. Overall, fantastic break in superb city loved it and will be returning.Note of caution can rain late March / April so take brolly !"
40,“Great time spent in Florence”,"Visited Florence for a birthday weekend - travelled with 3 young children 10,8,7.Stayed at :Una Vittoria Hotel - Different but enjoyable.Did the usual tourist stuff, nice atmosphere, felt very safe walking around in the evenings, taxi fares seemed inconsistent.Great food, travelling from Pisa to Florence by either train or bus.Fantastic time had by all.Only One complaint!Somebody on the Florence Tourist Board needs to sort out the terrible problems of dog mess all over the place, of the five in our family (who are generally careful walkers) we must have had around between 10-12 direct hits - It is absolutely disgusting,In so many ways the Italians are so far ahead of the UK, but the volume of dog poo dotted all over the City streets takes me back to Britain 1970's( or probably worse) ."
40,“Beautiful Tuscany experience”,"A beautiful Italian city, full of art and traditional buildings.Had a great time walking around the city and my son loved climbing up the stairs of the cathedral! Not recommended for elders and for the ones who aren't in good shape (too many steps and narrow).Uffizi is unique. Recommend the earlier booking but not via internet they charge too much when you can find at the museums desk tickets for later the same day or the next one for only 6€ on the ticket price."
30,“Driving in Florence”,"Last June 2008 we hired a car and drove from Lake Garda to Florence. We were returning the rental car in Florence and decided to drop our bags off at the hotel in the centre of Florence first. BIG MISTAKE. If anyone is considering driving in Florence I'd recommend not to!!!! NINE MONTHS after our trip 3 letters have arrived from the car rental company informing me that 60 euro has been taken from my credit card for each letter sent in relation to traffic violations. Nobody mentioned traffic violations, permits etc to us, nobody at the hotel we stayed at or the car rental company. It appears we entered zones in which driving permits were required. These zones more or less cover all of Florence. Also take note the 3 letters charging 60 euro each do not even include the fines. This charge is simply an admin charge from the car rental company to inform myself of impending fines and the authorities of my details.It's a wonderful city but this whole business with the fines has left us with a very sour taste and we certainly will not return with a car!"
50,“Firenze is a gem!!”,"Firenze is a magical city and I would urge all fellow travelers to visit.I was accommpanied by my sister and not at any time did we feel vulnerable or afraid walking about at night. People were friendly and extremely helpful.It is very easy to get about and you shouldn't get lost as many tourist attractions are within easy reach of each other. However, watch your footing as pavements and roads are very uneven. Also watch the traffic, especially the scooters!! They drive and ride very fast you really need your wits about you.The food and wine are wonderful, (especially Chianti Reserva), and we did not have one bad meal experience all the time we were there. Whatever you do please have a pizza!!! you can't beat the real thing. Most trittorias serve fresh pasta and you can really taste the differance. Delicious. There are so many cafes and trittorias you are spoiled for choice, but get reccommendations from the hotel staff, go where the locals eat and drink. You can also buy some delicious foodstuffs from SPAR SHOPS!!!! We had a picnic in Giardino de Boboli, (Piazza Piti), remember your wine bottle opener!! There is a Spar shop just 100 yards from entrance to gardens where you can buy delicious hams, cheeses and bread, (and of course wine).We spent a day in Siena, and traveled by train. It takes approximately 1 hour 40 minutes and takes you through some lovely Tuscan countryside. You can obtain tickets from the self-service booths or the ticket office within the station and they cost euros 6.20 each single journey. Remember to validate your ticket before boarding there are small yellow machines dotted about. (This is so you can't use your ticket again)!!! Siena has a very pretty Piazza where you can sit and watch the 'world go buy', with a glass or two of wine of course. Many of the cafes give you 'nibbles' for free which is a bonus. Our wine came with crisps, olives and small pieces of pizza, a lovely touch. We therefore did not need to order any lunch.Before you leave Florence you must try a Limonchello or Limonchello cream, a delicious Italian liquour. Ballisimo. It is readilly available here to buy and I am hooked.I adored Florence and i know you will too. I will certainly be returning in the very near future."
50,“Day Trip to Florence”,"We cruised the Mediterranean last October on the Norwegian Gem. This cruise included a stop in Livorno and we chose to go straight to Florence using Sunflower Tours. Our guide Giovanni took us to the sites we had asked to see and others that we thought were great. Since time was short we skipped the Uffizi Gallery, but did go to the Accademia to see the David. The best unexpected find, to us, was the Mercato Nuovo. Yes, it caters to the tourist crowd, but it was still fun to shop for leather goods and other souvenirs. We also had time after Florence for a quick trip to Vinci, the birthplace of Leonardo. It was great to leave the hustle of the city to relax amid the olive and grape covered hillsides. The one downside to the day was that it was overcast. However, the rain held off until we were on our way back to the ship. Giovanni was a real treat. Never tiring of our non-stop questions and giving us a sense of why he loves the area. He even gave us recommendations on buying a bottle of local wine."
20,“Florence-Beware !”,"We returned from a 5 day trip to Florence and felt compelled to write the following comments.The centre is a wealth of art and history of that their is no doubt. However, it is also full of a large number of restaurants which all consistantly charge crazy prices for fairly basic fare. We expected the trip to be expensive but were stunned at prices for coffee, wine and simple pasta dishes. The exchange rate is not helping a lot of people travelling to Europe but to sit and have a two course meal with wine cost us £70, coffee was £5 a cup, gin & tonic £13 each ! Dinner in the evening was never less than £100 in average restaurants.The street markets are impossible to browse through without hassle from stall owners and illegitimate traders offering fake goods and standing in your path ensuring slow progress. A relaxing time it was not.Threfore,if you are prepared to spend £200 a day for 2 people to eat and drink then this is the place for you personally speaking there are far nicer places in Italy to travel to without having to re-mortgage your home."
50,“My life in Florence”,"To experience Italy, is to experience Florence. I lived in Florence for 6 months and grew to love Italian culture. The attractions of the city are a must see, but some of my best days would be spent walking the streets off the beaten paths and find myself seeing a different side of the city from the resturants which are more mom and pop places and the enotecas that would have walls of wines to try. Everyone was very nice and I never had problem asking for directions."
50,“la dolce vita”,"FIRENZE!!! beautiful city. spent a lot of time at Accademia Gallery (to marvel at Michelangelo's David,) and the Uffizi Gallery (houses Botticelli's Birth of Venus and A LOT MORE). i remember purchasing a single ticket that allowed entry to both. there's a lot of busy cafe's and shops on the downtown sidestreets. Florence is a ""small town"" so it's ok to stray out of the tourist route and explore the surrounding areas. i stayed at Villa Camerata--- a 17th century villa perched on a hillside, surrounded by cypresses and vineyards. i had to take a bus from downtown to get to the villa, but AHHHH, It was worth it!"
50,“Best place to buy leather..”,Florence was one of the most beautiful cities I have ever had the pleasure of visiting.
50,“At the top of my list in Italy”,"There is *so much* to see and do in Florence and there's an abundance of tourist information everywhere, so I won't try. I would advise you read about some of the most famous places ahead of time so you'll know what you're seeing. One of the nicest things is that you can walk to most places.My 10-year old grandson and I had a hotel room just across the Ponte Vecchio, and we walked everywhere we went. (Be sure to have a map. Italian cities are not laid out on a grid and the streets go every which way.)There are many outdoor marketplaces where you can buy the things tourists like to buy, including nice leather goods, and knock-off designer handbags. Try haggling over the prices.Speaking of shopping, it's a great place to buy 18k gold jewelry. You can buy it in any of the ""gold"" shops; the Ponte Vecchio is full of them, but they're in other locations in Florence also. I doubt that you can bargain with them, but you can try if you like to do that.We went in April and the weather was great. Warm in the daytime, but not hot. And, yes, it will be full of tourists, but what can you expect? I suggest making hotel reservations (thru a travel agent at home) in advance.If you're a Michaelangelo ""fan,"" ask about the Buonorati (sp?) house which Michaelangelo bought for a nephew. There is a beautiful carved wood depiction of Christ on the cross. You don't have to be religious to appreciate this beautiful work. There are other interesting items there which you won't see elsewhere. This house isn't well-known to most tourists.Go (walk) to the train station, and get r/t tickets to Pisa. It isn't far, and you can see most of what you want in one day. Lots of vendors there also (right where the Cathedral, Baptistery & Bell Tower are, natch!).As for food, if it's your first trip to Europe and you like to eat breakfast, be sure to eat at your hotel as there are no restaurants that serve breakfast. Eat a light lunch and save your appetite for dinner, which in Italy is traditionally eaten late in the evening. I suggest you ask at your hotel for recommendations for good restaurants.It will definitely be expensive, even with a strong dollar, so be prepared. You can use your major credit cards and ATM cards in many places. Have a wonderful time!!"
30,"“Day trip to Florence, Italy.”","My wife and I took a day trip by train to Florence, for the ride as much as anything. Took the fast train from Rome Termini at around 9-30, arrived at around 11-00 in Florence,had light lunch and ice cream , did two open top 'Hop on Hop off' bus tours, took loads of photos but did not hop off. Wandered around for a while, as usual for Italy no seats to people watch from, exept in station waitng room.Then took the 17-00 something train back to Rome. Not much change out of 200 euros including the 80 cents each to use the toilets in the station, though they were clean, but a good day out and the weather was hot and sunny."
40,“Florence A City Of Art”,"We left for Florence early in the morning,by car from Pancole where we were staying. We were told that it would be better to travel by train as there were many parking restrictions in the city centre, so we drove to Poggibionsi which was the nearest train station. We bought our train tickets which only cost 10euros each. The trip took us almost an hour and we finally arrived at Florence's main train station which was called S. Maria Novella."
40,“nice town for 1 night”,"Florence was a quite town, but very pretty, lots of resturants and a few bars, we went to the irish pub in the square (where Michael angelos 'David' is). which had a good cocktail menu. there was an amazing street entertainer, like charlie chaplin, so funny and the crowd around him was massiv, he was amazing, so funny and spoke english, most was silent comedy getting people out of the crowd, hes been doing to 24 yrs and was great we watched him for ages. then we had a choc icecream and walked back to the hotel. florence was full of tourists from all over, there are lots of statues in the main square where 'David' is, it was bigger than i thought it would be. lots of shops and mrakets too in the daytime. I would recommend for a romantic few nights stay."
50,“A fabulous place to visit”,"We have just returned from a wonderful 7 days in Florence. We went at the hottest and supposedly most crowded time of the year but this did not detract from our enjoyment. If you are sensible and keep in the shade the heat is fine. A couple of times we had a siesta as the Italians do. It was not overly crowded as it is the time of year when the Italians go on holiday, but it is easy to avoid any crowds as there are a myriad of side streets to use in order to get from place to place.We wanted to make a couple of points to help those of you going to Florence in the future.Firstly, if you are flying into Pisa airport, there is apparently one train per hour that goes directly to Florence although we couldnt see it on the timetable. But every 15 mins there is a shuttle train which you catch into Pisa central and from there you get a train into Florence. Also you must validate your train ticket in the little yellow boxes on every platform. You can buy your ticket at the airport and it is useable for about 2 months. We did discover on our way home that there is a coach which goes directly into Florence which is 8 euros, so that may be a better option.Pre-book a tour of the Uffizzi gallery online to completely avoid the queues.Pre-book tickets online (not a tour its not worth it) to the Galley del Accademia to see Michaelangelo's David.If you want cheap but lovely pasta and panini go to La cantinetta on the Borgo San Lorenzo just north of the Duomo.For the best ice cream go to Vivoli on the Via Isola delle Stinche about halfway between the Bargello museum and the Piazza Santa Croce.For the best views of Florence climb up to the church of San Miniato stopping at the Piazza Michelangelo on the way. Also a climb up the inside of the duomo is well worth it as you get to see the frescoes inside the dome up close and the views from the top are fabulous.The Pitti palace and Boboli gardens are a must as there are some fantastic works of art both renaissance and more modern in the palace and the gardens are full of hidden gems.The sunset viewed from the Ponte Vecchio really is wonderful and very romantic but be prepared to share it with lots of other tourists.Having coffee etc in one of the Piazza's is a lovely thing to do but be prepared to pay top prices especially for drinks and then they often add service to your bill. If you are on a budget it is better to seek out the many bars and trattorias that are in the side streets, we had the best food at some of these.We could go on for ever there is so much to do in Florence but if you want a taste of Tuscany outside of Florence then we advise doing a tour. We did one which went to Siena, San Giminagno, lunch at a vineyard in Chianti and finishing at the leaning tower of Pisa and all for 80 euros each, it was well worth it."
40,“Wonderful art galleries & palaces”,"About 3 weeks before I left for Florence, I had pre-booked entry tickets for Galleria Accadenia & the Uffizi Gallery. Visitors could spend long, tiring hours standing in a long. long queue if they don't. But my tip is this: don't go for these expensive on-line reservations through on-line agencies. They are a rip-off (unless you are very wealthy), because the final cost for tickets could cost you up to 3 times as much as you would pay, if you were buying them directly from the Florence Galleries. If you phone Florence directly, 7.30 a.m. if you are in Britain, you will get you Booking No. over the phone, for the day & the hour you want to come; and you don't need to pay anything until you arrive at the gallery, with your booking particulars.But don't take any nonsense from any entrance staff, who may try to keep you waiting in the queue long past your reservation time.I turned up early for my booking at the Galleria Accademia, and the woman attendant simply said: ""Go to the back of the queue""; and as the queue seemed to be about the length of the street and more, I was very surprised. I asked several people in the queue if they had tickets, and none of them had. Then I found a much shorter queue nearer the entrance for people holding reservations, just waiting for their appointed time. As it was pouring rain at the time, I didn't want to stand in it any longer than necessary. Then a very angry American woman came up demanding to know why she had been kept waiting, in the rain, in that long, long queue, for nearly an hour past her reservation time. I felt very sorry for her, because of the incompetence of the entrance attendant, who hadn't told her just to wait a few minutes in the short ""pre-booked"" queue. Fortunately, she was admitted immediately. I'd have been very angry about that too.The Galleria Accedemia is worth a visit, but if it weren't for Michelangelo's David, I can't see that it would be any grander than many other famous galleries which you simply walk into without fuss, and without any need to restrict the daily & hourly volume of visitors.The Uffizi is truly amazing: a bit top-heavy on the altar-pieces and Nativity scenes, but the collection is huge and the paintings are magnificent quality. It takes 3 to 4 hours to go round it, and you can still feel you're rushing it.The Palazzo Vecchio, Palazzo Riccardi, the Medici Chapel, and the Palazzo Pitti, are all well worth visiting and don't require pre-booking. Palazzo Vecchio has a real medieval character to it.The Medici Chapel is amazing for the majestic marble-clad walls and its statues. The Palazzo Pitti is an enormous art gallery, with a large & varied collection of paintings from all periods; and it also has the former Royal Apartments on display. It can take 4 to 5 hours to go round it all, and you can leave with ""crippled"" feet and an abiding hatred of hard, marble floors. (They look very attractive & handsome, but they ""kill"" your feet. Give me good, springy, timber flooring anyday.) if you have any energy left, the Boboli Gardens are lovely, but perhaps better left for the next day.The Piazza della Signoria is the favourite place where all the tourists congregate, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio. You can see a plaque on the ground, where the unfortunate Savonarola was burned at the stake. The real attractions are the Hercules fountain and the wonderful collection of marble and bronze statues"

50,“Great tour guide for a private tour.”,I just returned from a Mediterranean Cruise with my family and some friends. Our favorite part of the trip was a private tour of Florence. I took a chance by hiring Paola Migliorini from reading a couple of reviews on Trip Advisor about how great she was. We definitely were not disappointed. Paoli greeted us at the dock as we disembarked and escorted us through Tuscany for awhile. Our next stop was to a vineyard for a wine tasting (we requested this as a part of our tour). After a delightful time of tasting and learning from a third generation wine maker we were driven to Florence. Paoli was easy to understand and very knowledgeable (her college major was art history). After our guided tour she gave us about one hour to explore on our own after which we were driven back to port. Paoli and her husband run a small business Tuscany Tours and they are fully licensed. She gives tours in 4 different languages. Next time you find yourself in Tuscany treat yourself to a delightful day!
50,“A little piece of Renaissance heaven”,"The first thing that I realised when I arrived for the first time in Florence was the size of the city: pretty compact! After travelling up and down the length of Italy for three weeks previously, I expected it to be much larger and harder to get around by foot. How else did they fit all of the attractions and activities I had read about in my guidebook?? Much better to circumnavigate compared to Rome (I think I had seven blisters on each foot after my stay there, one for every hill in Rome...). Lovely little windy streets and atmospheric lanes, jam-packed full of cool shops and curios.Florence is fantastic: everything is easy to get to by walking (if you love strolling around - like me! - with a gellato in hand and full of yummy Italian coffee on a lovely sunny day). Lots of Medici stuff everywhere you go: from the Boboli gardens, various churches, the Ponte Vecchio...their imprint is everywhere.The main highlights for me were the Duomo and the Galleria degli Uffizi. The Duomo is amazing, spectacular and gorgeous. It fills up the skyline completely - and takes you away to another place. The detail - even down to the bronze doors is precise and exquisite. The Uffizi is a Mecca for any art lovers out there. I love art, but I'm not an artistic person (squiggly stick men are my forte) - so reading the background history for each piece of art was as exciting for me as actually seeing it in real life for myself (favourite piece: Botticelli's ""La Primavera""). The cafe is pretty expensive: I had an Irish coffee there (a prerequisite for any Irish person) & nearly choked on it when I saw the bill. I think I was paying for the view (which was lovely) of the city.For some strange reason, I have also seen Gallileo Gallilei's dead, desiccated finger as an exhibit.... don't ask me why I thought this was a good idea!:)If you like food: my favourite place to go is Danny Rock. I've been to Florence a few times now, and the food (and price) is excellent. The pasta and pizza are lovely, and the house wine is cheap and pretty good. Went to more upscale restaurants, but when it came down to it they didn't offer anything better than this place. It was also full of Italian people, which is a good indicator for good food.Favourite place to chill out: Boboli gardens - beautiful and warm in spring and summer. Great to stroll around - and if you are lazy like me - have a bit of a snooze on a bench by the fountains or read a book. Great little statues and walkways to look at and walk around. Put on lots of sunscreen... you will need it.I love this city and would recommend at least three to five days to view everything. If you have more time to spare: go to Siena for a night or two and explore the wine country (Montelcino, Montelpulciano etc..). Pisa can be viewed in a day, as there is only the Piazza de Mercali (sp?) (where the Leaning Tower resides) that has any 'wow' factor."
50,“A Renaissance Masterpiece”,"Florence is the scene of great museums displaying the greatest treasure trove of Renaissance Art in the world. The Uffizi is the greatest arranged in chronological order which makes it a doable art museums for tourists. The Accademia has Michaelangelo's David along with several other partially sculpted pieces. The Baregllo has great sculpture. There are many wonderful churches with great art - Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita, Ognissanti, Santa Croce, and the Cathedral (Duomo). Florence has great shopping and two fabulous markets. The food is outstanding. Gelato the best - go to Vivoli. I suggest the hotel Croce di Malta, which I have stayed a dozen times. This is a four star hotel, with a swimming pool in its back garden. The front desk people are outstanding people !!!"
50,"“Art, best views,food in Florence”","ART: Do not miss Santa Maria Novella with beautiful frescoes by Ghirlandaio, Museum di San Marco with heavenly Fra Angelico, Santa Maria del Carmine with Brancacci Chapel (Masaccio, Lippi, Masolino). Galleria dell’Academia has not only David but a good museum of musical instruments with a couple Stradivaris and an excellent DVD guide of the music history (with recordings on period instruments), plus a great collection on the 2nd floor (with Lorenzo Monaco) and the largest outside Eastern Europe collection of Russian icons.For the best VIEWS of the city, no need to climb the Dome: go to a veranda in Giardino Bardini (a short, though steep, climb) where Italians come to sit and relax, enjoying in silence the views of the city or reading. For a yet higher point – go to Piazza Michelangelo with tons of tourists; or walk 5 min more to get to an even higher point – Chiesa San Miniato al Monte. Both places offer an unforgettable sunset view!Chiesa Sam Miniato has a great store of products made by the monks from this monastery (the liquor and honey are EXCELLENT). Every day at 5p.m. (in winter) and 5.30p.m. (in summer) monks sing with an organ concert preceding it.FOOD: café “Rivoire” on Piazza della Signoria – if your line to the Uffizi gets too long, you can always try excellent hot chocolate (standing at the bar is cheaper). Indulge in Santa Maria Novella pharmacy’s products, or just looking around it and its little museum is quite pleasurable too. The owner of Famousvini (Via Cavour 30/a) will give you the best recommendation on Italian wines, telling the nuances of each wine with exact knowledge and poetic feel. For a cheap bite of very good pizza go to Pugi (Piazza San Marco 9). Osteria di San Spirito on Piazza S.Spirito is more expensive but serves excellent food (one of the best matches between quality of food and the price that is usually very hard to find across the river in the more touristy part)."
40,“Worth staying and walking”,"My husband and daughter just came back from visiting our son, who's studying abroad in Florence. What a city! it's our second time there, this time we spend more days and were able to walk and enjoy the city.We stayed at a Bed and Breakfast, which offers apartments also. This was a great option for us, we cooked and spend a lot of family time together. Since we did local grocey shopping we felt more like locals than tourist. We recomend this as an option for families visiting, helps keep the budget.The Bed and Breakfast is called "" The Bed and Breakfast in Florence"", located in Via Santa Maria about 3 blocks from the Pitti Palace, mostly locals. We bought homemade olive oil and wine for our dinners!!!FANTASTIC. In the afternoons we would go to the Santo Spiritu Plazza, a lot of young people.Florence is a very dynamic and young city, we walked at very late hours of the night and always felt very safe.The historic area of the city already was crowed."
50,“One of my favorite cities”,I got the priviledge of taking my parents to see the David for their first time. I love this art filled city. Go to Florence. The art is amazing. The gelato is heavenly. The people of Italy are beautiful.
40,“Our 5 day stay”,"We stayed in a 11th century apartment with a mezzanine floor overlooking a men's store...what more can I say! It was just around from the SMN railway station and the Santa Maria Novella Church, which was being renovated. We were in walking distance to every thing and at the back of the railway station there is a supermarket which provided us with our cooking needs including a nice bottle of the local wine, Santa Maria Cristina at a reasonable price.The bus station is across the road from the supermarket and one day we went out to San Gimignano for the day. It drizzled rain most days but we ventured over the Ponte Vecchio and looked in the jewellery shops, bought at the marketsincluding a cashmere poncho to ward off the cold and some Murano glass. Palazzo Pitti is just over the Ponte Vecchio and worth a look at the grounds and some statues and antiques inside. The Uffizzi Gallery is full of paintings, mainly of the Madonna and Christ but the history and size of some is very interesting. Book this in advance to jump queues!Coming back from the Ponte Vecchio in the drizzling rain, the smell of waffles cooking dragged us around the corner where we had two large ones with gelato jammed in the middle!"
50,“A trip back in time”,"A trip to Florence Italy is like a trip back in time. It is easy to be in touch with buildings and locations that date back a thousand years or more. The ease with which the old and the new blend together is simply astounding. You are not in Kansas any more. Bring good hiking shoes and a healthy appetite. The incredible blend of pedestrian, bike, scooter, motorcycle, car, cab, bus and truck on the very narrow streets are a thing of wonder. I had always wondered why Florence had so many piazzas and now I know. It is so you can relax in between walking the streets that take a lot of concentration. The simplicity of the food is so wonderful. The flavors are allowed to show off rather that playing second fiddle. And the wine, need I say more."
50,“Beautiful...”,"Beautiful city! So serene and picturesque! Rich with art, I loved the food and the entire ambience of this city. Its one of those places I could picture myself living for a few years at some point in my life..."
20,“Florence; The City”,"March 24th 2008I have just returned from a five day trip to Florence. Let's put aside the art and the architecture and concentrate on Florence the city.It's dirty, smelly, overrun with tourists, beggars, illegal immigrants selling illicit goods, traffic and the air is thick with pollution. Florence in the summer must be horrendous.Considering the vast amounts of tourist's euros that must go into the coffers each year, the council have done very little to improve amenities. Pavements are broken, buildings have years of grime on them (they are cleaning the Duomo!), public toilets are few and far between unless in a gallery, the clock on the wonderful tower of the Vecchio Palace doesn't work, there are few green places to escape the hustle and bustle and seats are few and far between in the piazzas and the river is not utilised. To cap it all everything is very expensive although one can eat and drink cheaply if you look for it.On the very positive side; the art is unbelievable and the architecture staggering. Visit with your eyes wide open and don't succumb to paying extortionate prices over the net prior to going.The Pitti Palace is wonderful with a huge selection of art from different eras as well as objets d'art; much better than the Uffizi.If you're flying into Pisa, catch the Terravision bus at 8 euros that takes you straight into Florence to the railway station. It dovetails into most UK flights.sandieb@ntlworld.com"
50,“Picturesque Beauty”,Do not visit Florence on a Monday as all the main attractions are closed.If you want to see the Michealangelo Exhibit; do not wait all day in the line and waste your time.Go to the Museum 2 mins away...can't remember the name...close to it and buy the tickets; that way you can get in the same day and avoid the line.Don't forget to visit the marketplace and bargain the vendors; they do bend :)Enjoy your stay..it's a beautiful place...
50,“The most romantic city in the world”,"Florence is a romantic and artistic place with striking buildings, galleries and historical churches. The city is full of elegant appearance like the skyline, all red rooftops and domes, is indeed a picturesque."
40,“Florence in 2 Days”,"Just returned from lovely Florence having followed all the recommendations from the Florence Forum, so here is some feed back.Flew in to Pisa from the UK on BA, and caught the straight through train from the airport to Florence, ( we could just as easily caught a train to Pisa Central and changed if there hadnt been a convenient straight through), I'd prepaid the train tickets through the Trenitalia site and printed the tickets at home , I understand these can just be shown to the inspector on request, dont need to be date stamped in the yellow machines but as no one inspected I cant confirm that. Also I took the 1st Class option for just a couple of euro more but there was no 1st class carriage on the way out. A bit of care is needed in recognising stations, few name signs along the platforms but Florence Santa Maria Novella is the end of that line. Trains stations are heavily graffitted but the service is good.Booked the Hotel San Gallo Palace which was about 9 on the poularity list, a nice little modern hotel on the Piazza della Liberta. We had a ground floor superior room at the back with a good size terrace, not much of a view , bit hemmed in by garden wall with other buildings above. The room was very spacious, king size bed, excellent bathroom with power shower. breakfast was good and all staff extremely courteous and helpful. The hotel has business meeting facilities so fairly well used by businesses (which didnt interfere with us) as well as Trip advisor guests.I think the location was a slight drawback for us, I'd multimapped the post code which showed it to be at the Forte da Basso end of via lorenzo M, but was in fact right up on the Piazza Della Liberta, would ve taken a taxi or bus if I had realised, and the traffic on the Piazza outside the hotel was extremely busy and crossing the roads need a lot of care. The walk back to town was about 10/15 minutes down to the Piazza Mercado the start of the interesting stuff, somehow the walk back took longer and was a bit tedious after a hard days sightseeing.Reserving the Uffizzi and Accademia by telephone from the UK worked really well, got the number from the Uffizi website which also works for other bookables on the same call, and it is pay on the door. Do not use ticket agencies, which cost much more and are prepay. We also visited San Croce and walked up to lunch at Piazza Michaelangelo all as stunning as advertised. Almost too much to see and do.We took a taxi down to the centre to eat and walk in the evening (about 10 Euro each way) had a good meal outside in the Piazza Republica by the carousel, twas cold but the patio heaters were more than adequate, we also had a very good posh meal round the corner at la Poste. we also ate well at Alfredo near the Hotel, there are wonderful coffees and small cakes to be had in the Piazza coffee bars. We still havent got the tipping right, a number of times having checked that service was included we were then acosted by the waiter pointing out that the charge was for the restaurant and he didnt get any of it, so I gave him a tip as well?Returning home we got a taxi to the station (17euro) and the train to Pisa Central (had a 1st class carriage), dropped the cases in left luggage and walked to the tower in about 20 minutes. We booked the earliest tower climb for about an hour later and meantime ate a good lunch outside in the sunshine at an adjacent trattoria. The whole tower experience , churches and surroundings were stunning and really pleased we planned that in, couldve done with more time there but had to catch the plane. All in all a must do trip. And Hi to Linda and Jim from Detroit"
50,“Dolce Vita”,"After a Summer of traveling Europe with Contiki Holidays I found Italy, especially Florence to be my favorite location. The Contiki Coach arrived in Florence on a Wednesday night...all my friends who I made with Contiki and I went to eat out and the most amazing restaurant, ordering Pizza and Pasta and VINO! The food was delicious and I had expected nothing less. Afterward the group split and we went our own ways to experience the Nightlife. Florence at night is another culture in itself. People from the ages of 5 to 75 roam the streets listening to street music, licking gelato and enjoying the scenery. I first went to the famous Ponte Vecchio Bridge where music was being played by a local Italian. The bridge was filled with people laughing, kissing, and listening. So much romance and fun filled the air. My two new girlfriends I made on the Contiki Tour, and a couple of guys split a bottle of Tuscan wine as we watched the performers before we went out...Our first stop was The Red Garter...which was fun, but a little Touristy...we asked one of our tour guides who we saw at the bar where would be better to go...he advised us to go this this DiscoTeca called Central Park...AMAZING! It’s only open in the summer, so I suggest anyone looking for a summer trip go here...it is a huge open roof club with palm trees, four bars, three dance floors and amazing lounges...it was beautiful and fun!After that hard night out till 5 in am...I didn’t think I would have much fun during the early morning, however Florence day life is just as amazing. The architecture and history of the city is magnificent and breathtaking, I had never seen anything so beautiful. Contiki provided a city tour for us, but after half the tour I decided to wander off by myself and sit and watch the Italian life and culture. I sipped on a cappuccino and listened to the beautiful Italian language. Later I visited museums and the David (which is amazing). Everything Florence had to offer was amazing...Later that week Contiki brought us to Venice, a part of Tuscany and Sienna, and I must say this is a country I will definitely travel back to...Italy is a MUST!"
50,“My favorite city for art and food”,"I've been there so many times (last time in May 2007) that it's a joy to write about. I don't do hotels anymore because I've a lovely place to stay with family (wouldn't you love that). We used to stay at the Palazzo Antellesi on Piazza Sta. Croce. Recently it was available through SACO for weekly-plus rentals. Check out SACO apartments online. I stayed there over New Years for at least five years, and my husband and I stayed at SACO properties this year in Glasgow (two months) and London (one week) and they have bedrooms, living room and full kitchen with laundry for about 2/3 the price of a hotel. All were very nice.Before I get to restaurants, soap. Gorgeous soaps in a former church, a monument to beautifully made soaps, candles and herbal remedies is yours at Farmacia Santa Maria Novello. Look it up online - they have three stores now in the US but you have to go there. I love their milk soap (sapone di latte) and pomegranate soap (sapone alla melograno). Also check out leather goods in the markets at San Lorenzo and the old straw market. At the straw market (Mercato Nuovo) make certain to drop a coin off il Porcellino's tongue - he's the bronze boar who will give you the luck to come back to Florence. Hey, it worked for me! Also Ponte Vecchio for gold. No matter the design they sell it by weight. Don't negotiate on price.Art. The Uffizi for sure. They may even have online advance ticketing by now (Italians take a long time to do certain things, and this is one of them, but it beats standing in line for hours). And Galleria Accademia, for David if nothing else. And Santa Croce for Donatello and great frescoes and the Leather Store.People-watching. Rivoire, on Piazza Signoria. Sit outside facing David (copy) and The Great White One and have an espresso, don't order cappucino after lunch. And Vivoli for the best gelato in the world!Restaurants. Most of my favorites are near Santa Croce, because that's where I spent the most time. For high-end, try il Cibreo (cafe may be easier to get into), Cantinetta Antinori, Buca Lapi for bistecca a deux. More reasonable include Pallotino (great frites), Mario near San Lorenzo and lunch only, il Maremma for squash ravioli with sage butter, Osteria la Quinto, Trattoria Anita for ""workingman's lunch,"" Il Fagioli for beans with sausage. I c'e ce ce (ee chay chay chay) for great salmon and frites, fried in olive oil. Badia a Coltibuono, out of town in Gaole in Chianti for reserved dinner as you travel through Chianti country.Walks. Cross the Arno east of the Ponte Vecchio and head uphill past the parking lot/view area by Michelangelo's David (a small copy) and uphill to San Miniato al Monte. Now's not the time to have forgotten your camera in the hotel room.Enjoy! And remember, ""a tavola non si in vecchia mai."" At the table, no-one grows old. Ciao"
40,“Update Mid Sept07 of some building rennovations”,"Having just returned (from a return visit after 15 years) after couple of weeks in Florence and Venice I offer for the unwary (the rest Know that due to the accumulation of 2000 years plus of culture there are Always going to be some parts under repair) -that in Florence the scaffolding outside the Uffizi doesn't hamper the enjoyment inside,(pre-booked tickets are picked up just a few meters beyond it toward the river-before crossing back to the other side before actually entering). However while the niches behind the main altars in both Santa Croce and St Lorenzo chapels have the altars clear, the whole of both niches behind are pretty much obscured at the moment with a lot of scaffolding which may prove quite a disappointment to some. (I do not use flash inside churches out of respect for those who wish to use church for the purpose it was built-so no internal pics. here -there are plenty of post cards etc available anyway.)The weather is starting to break down -so take a good waterproof (and a woolly for occasional use) plus ''good'' shoes as the puddles can be significant on some roads!-If prepared then the enjoyment should remain high....and the queues are much shorter!! (Those on short stay should probably still consider the somewhat pricey 'Prenottazione'' booking system-it cuts down on standing in the rain,even if the queues are now not so huge as they usually are during spring and summer)-While the old Farmacia of S.Maria Novella is an interesting experience- it may prove costly as their produce is truly excellent....but go and just breathe...It's not on all the tourist trails and is a couple of hundred meters round the corner from the bottom of the piazza and is a change from the mediæval, being more reminiscent of the late 1800s -so may be a relief to some. Unfortunately the square in front of the cathedral is also looking like a builders yard at present and there's scaffolding all over the facia of the church,too.....but maintenance takes time if it's to be done to the required standard.There is a small amount of scaffolding near the Baptistry outside the Duomo at present , but this doesn't obtrude too much. (In neither of the first 2 pics was I attempting to highlight the building works-in fact the opposite)-and for those who hadn't heard the Ghiberti doors are now housed inside the Museo dell Opera (at the opposite end of the cathedral piazza,behind the dome )-but at least this means one can get a decent look at what used to be the topmost panels! )We then took a train to Venice and would forewarn anyone not familiar with the Italian railway system that there seemed to be two disparate seating numbering systems In the SAME Carriage,depending which end you enter at - This perplexed a party of Americans every bit as much as we northern Europeans...However the pre-booked (online) tickets proved just fine once we found our seats -and what we had requested...and in the carriage indicated though there were obviously not going to be 84 seats in that carriage (which we had entered at the lower end of the numbering sequence.)...not so much quaint (it was the Eurostar Express -nice and clean ,quiet ,fast,aircon etc) ...more just weird and incomprehensible.-No doubt in a couple of months this update will be out of date, but it seemed worthy of mentioning -especially to those who may only get there once in their lifetimes and harbour innocently overoptimistic expectations. Perhaps others might keep 'updates' going for those who are planning their trips."
40,“Italian life”,"We spent 10-days in Florence and had a really lovely time. it was long enough to get out of teh city and visit Lucca, the coast etc. We found the outlet shopping which was fabulously stylish with a lot of great bargains.We were in Florence for a wedding which was in the countryside just 10 mins out of town. Easy to get to and a real tuscany treat. The city itself is very busy with tourists (though not as bad as Roma). It's a good idea to have a pool because it does get very hot and makes the siesta so much more pleasant. We stayed in an older style 3-bed apartment, with terrace. Hot, comfortable and a brilliant base to share a holiday.We got into the lifestyle of taking things very calmly, eating well, slowing, enjoying life. No reason to stress, if something's not open mid-day, just come back when it is. It was very relaxing and enjoyable for us."
40,“Florence overview!”,"Florence was just a hop, skip, and a jump from Genova once the ferry (Grandi Navi Veloci's Corraggio) transported us overnight from Barcelona...NOT! Once we disembarked (3 hours late), we caught a taxi from the port to the train station and with a little help from a friendly Swedish fellow at the station we found our way onto the proper train for Pisa, where with a little help from a friendly Spanish couple, we found the proper train to Florence and found out the leaning tower was too far away to see in between trains, oh well. We also learned that the automated ticket machines are easy to use, and have an English option, so that's the best bet when traveling in Italy instead of standing in a long ticket lines. Once in Florence, we knew our Hotel, Pension Ferretti, was only supposed to be a 5 minute walk, so we headed out into the city on our own. We were headed in the right direction until we asked for help at a fork from some Americans who ended up pointing us in the wrong direction. It turns out that our street's name was covered up by some construction, so had we chosen the left fork we would have been right there. Instead we dragged our bags around for an extra 20 minutes up and down the narrow streets of Florence until we found the place, only learning 3 days later on the way back to the train station where we'd made that initial wrong turn. And we discovered along the way that numbering buildings in Florence is just a silly game they play, there is no rhyme nor reason to the order, so don't expect 2,4,6,8 etc. on one side and 1,3,5,7, etc. on the other. Pension Ferretti turned out to be a nice surprise, despite its 1 star rating. The front desk is up on the first floor after two sets of stairs, but that was about the only negative. The location was within easy walking distance of everything, the room was clean and had a private bath (and even a hair dryer, which made Brian happy), there was a computer with free internet access, as well as a small but adequate breakfast served daily. The room had a nice overhead fan and wonderful large windows which kept the room cool at night. It was all we could have asked for for 80 Euros per night right in the heart of Florence. Once we'd settled in, we found a lovely restaurant right outside our hotel's doors with traditional food, somewhat fair prices (still pretty tourist level), and tables outdoors with overhanging vines for a real Italian feel! With our bellies full, we took in Florence by night and went about getting shots of the Duomo and Ponte Vecchio at night, and once I'd figured out the special settings on the camera and found a place to rest it, I got some pretty nice ones. That night we also saw the Palazzo Vecchio, Piazza del Signora, Piazza del Republica, and a few more random churches whose names escape me. We really enjoyed the sculptures in the Piazzo del Signora all lit up at night. Day 1 was first spent waiting in line for the Uffizi, which we expected. We did attempt to wake up early, but 9 was the best we could muster. After the 3 hour wait (which we survived by having our characteurs drawn), we were allowed entrance and we took in the beautiful Renaissance artwork of the masters including the Venus and the Primavera to name a few. I did enjoy it, but after a while there is only so many virgins, mother with child, and christs on crosses that I could stomach. I definitely rushed through the second half more than the first. The second half of the day was spent at the Palazzo Piti on the other side of the river, where we viewed their Silver and costume collections, but skipped the massive gardens due to the heat. In between the visits, we did do some shopping and haggling, of course, finally deciding on a leather purse for my friend Laura (hope she likes it) and passing up a beautiful suede and leather antelope jacket for Brian (he couldn't bring himself to spend 600 Euro on one thing for himself). I got a lovely calligraphy set for myself with a fancy purple feather from a shop along the river (near the Ponte Vecchio) and a ""C"" seal and wax so I can send some fancy letters to friends and family when I get home. Day 2 was spent at the Accademia taking in Michalangelo's David, definitely impressive in person, and walking around the Mercato Centrale (just ended up with some T shirts). We also attempted to take in all the sights we saw the first night during the day as well. We do, however, regret passing up going inside the Duomo, but there was only so much time. Overall, Florence was a beautiful old city with loads of art (perhaps too much at times) and a wondeful place to get lost in narrow streets and meander at night!"
40,“florence tips”,"My husband and I got back from Florence last week. What a wondeful city. We made reservations ahead of time for the Uffizi and the Accedemia and were very grateful when we saw the lines. We also explored the Pitti Palace ( and its gardens out back!!), the Duomo,etc, the Basilica di San Lorenzo,the Medici chapel(sp?). We walked across the Ponte Vecchio( didn't buy any jewelry!), ate lots of gelato and steak, bought purses for our daughters and shoes for my husband.A couple of reminders/tips:1) Remember to dress modestly when going to any church or catherdral - it looked like more women were being busted on too much cleavage than too much leg. I think it was at the Duomo that ""they"" would hand out ghastly paper ""robes"" to wear if ladies were exposing too much chest( and it didn't seem to me to these tanks would be considered too revealing in the states). Those robes had to be HOT and looked disconcertedly like what we wear at the doctor's office! Just remember to show some respect.2) Florentine steak is fabulous and fairly reasonable. ORDER SOME! This coming from a Texan!3)If you have the means, explore the idea of a knowledgable guide for some of the museum tours. We didn't always feel like we had enough info to fully appreaciate what we were viewing - esp at the Pitti Palace which had a dizzying amount of paintings in each room and no rhyme or reason that I could figure.4) Restaurants are open fairly late so we figured out that we toured and walked and shopped like crazy until 5 or so, went back to our hotel and took a LONG nap and went back out after 8 and things were just beginning to hop. I had NO idea that daylight savings time over in Europe means that it doesn't get dark until 10.5)Keep a bit of change in your pocket for the occasional place that charges for the restroom.HAVE FUN!"
40,“My trip to Florence”,"Because I relied on tripadvisor for so much, I wanted to give a report on my trip. I will be doing indivicual summaries for each city I travelled to: Rome, Florence, Venice and Milan. We also went to Lucca,Pisa, Montepulciano,Varenna(Lake Como),Sorrento, Pompeii, and Positano. If you will be going to any of these places, my reviews will be posted on the appropriate sites.When planning my trip, I read so much about pickpockets, scams, what to wear, etc. I live very close to NYC , been to many major cities in USA. I found that all these places in Italy were no different than any big city in the USA.One thing I neglected to mention in my Rome report that pertains to all the cities, is the grafitti. It is really a disgrace that ugly scribbling are all over these beautiful old buildings!! the graffiti made the cities look dirty and run down. Someone wrote (in English!!) ""I can't help stop this grafitti game"" along the Arno River wall.As for what to wear, I normally wear neutral tones. But for anyone who doesn't, I wouldn't go running out to buy clothes to look like a local. Except for Milan (all you need there is a pair of jeans, shirt and flats - alot were even wearing white sneakers!!) everyone was wearing white sneakers, flip flops or loafers, shorts, colorful shirts. I think I saw more tourists than locals. I realize that we are tourists and we shouldn't have to try to be someone we are not.Florence: Must see Uffizi Gallery and Accademia - Both need reservations otherwise you'll stand on a long line for a long time. The audioguide worked for us in the Uffizi. The only complaint about them is I would get confuse on which painting/sculpture I should be looking at and the audioguide does not discuss every painting in the room. We spent about 2 1/2 hours there. You'll spend about an hour the most in the Accademia. Therefore if you have 8:30 reservations at the Uffizi, you could make 12:00-12:30 reservations at the Accademia.The day we focused on Florence, it started to storm in the afternoon so we headed to the Pitti Palace which contains more modern art/decor. If you have time, it is worth going to see.I found Ponte Vecchio, the big spot for shopping a waste of time - a tourist trap and if you ever been to the NYC, it looked like the Diamond Exchange and nothing was cheap. The shops along the Arno River were very nice if you want to find something to buy that is different. The only plus is that you can get great pictures of the Arno River and building around the river from here. Shopping in city center are basically regular stores that you'll see everywhere in Italy.For restaurants- go along the side streets, to find the non-touristy restaurants.We took day trips to Chianti Region (Greve), Lucca, Pisa, Cinque Terre and Montepulciano. See review in appropriate forum."
40,“4 nights in Florence”,"We just returned from 1/2 term trip to Florence. Journey started with Ryanair flight to Pisa from Stansted and then we decided on a train to Florence which costs just over 5 euro each one way.The journey is supposed to take 90 minutes but in fact took 2 hours - I would recommend taking the 'Terravision' bus from the airport which costs just over 8 euro but only takes 70 mins.A word of warning about public transport in Italy....you must always stamp your ticket in the machines at the stations or on the buses (we found this out when the ticket inspector on the train fined us 5 euro each for not having punched our tickets at the train station) There are no signs and nobody tells you so make sure you use the machine at the start of your journey.There were 12 people in our train compartment and none of them knew the rules so were all fined!Once in Florence either by train or bus you will find yourself at Florence train/bus station. We stayed at the Holiday Inn south of town which was a bus ride from the centre but the fare was only just over 1 euro each ride and the buses came every 10 minutesuntil the evening when the service was reduced to 1 every 1/2 hr.Holiday Inn was clean and simple with an outdoor pool which opens on 1st June. We decided on Italian breakfast of coffee, juice and pastry in a charming cafe just round the corner from the hotel.Florence was very, very busy with tourists including us, and I would adivse pre-booking Ufizi and Academy museums to ensure entry at desired times and dates. Take passports for proof of age for concessions.On the last day we took the bus to Pisa airport and left our luggage so we could catch a bus into town to see the leaning tower and Cathedral. Well worth the effort!We thoroughly enjoyed our trip and even our 20yr and 17yr old daughters appreciated the sights and art treasures.I would like to have explored the countryside outside the city and visit Sienna but had no time, so will have to return to Tuscany."
40,“First trip to Florence”,"I went to Florence for 3 days last week, I flew from Coventry, UK to Pisa and then took a bus from the airport into Florence.(Terravision 8 euros). We arrived at the main train station, Santa Maria Novella. We then took a cab straight to our Hotel (14 euros). (Hotel Jolly Carlton). This all sounds very straight forward....and that's because it was! After a lot of anticipation and nervous planning, I did the trip and it all worked out well.I'm a mum aged 43 and booked the trip on a whim because I could get cheap flights from Coventry and I had always wanted to go to Florence...soon the month and then days of departure were looming near...I used Trip Advisor ALOT! - I checked out many many hotels and although the hotel I eventually plumped for was not as exciting as a Florentine Boutique Hotel, it was clean, spacious, with a lovely deep bath and a very reasonable breakfast, friendly staff and even a piano man who'd play for you late in the evening after having dinner out.I couldn't get a ticket to the Uffizi because they were sold out on my dates BUT I did reserve online for a voucher for the Galleria dell' Accademia to see Michelangelo's David. We still had to wait in line but only for about 15 minutes and the crowd waitiing were all generally chatty and excited about the visit. It was amazing. I also loved the slaves/prisoner's emerging from the stone, the work unfinished and intentionally so.I also queued for a hike up to the top of the Duomo. (Queue was about 20 minutes total and 6 euros) It is 463 steps but well worth the effort if you can do it. Not just for the view of Florence and the wonderful red roof tops - but once climbed you actually enter in the inside of the actual cupola and can almost touch the work by Vasari and Zuccari (The Last Judgement). You are so high it makes you feel a bit giddy but it is really awe inspiring and you marvel at the work of all the craftsmen especially Brunelleschi.My trip was just 3 days but I walked and walked as literally every street, house, delicatessen is SO beautiful - I think I overused the word 'amazing' as the architecture is just brilliant and you feel almost transported to another time.I used the Lonely Planet City guide to get me around - this was really useful and pretty accurate re: places to eat and other recommendations (only grumble was that the map was just too small - but that's probably my age! However there are plenty of free maps about ie: the hotel etc so I just used one of these instead. On my last night I went over the river and wished I'd gone sooner as there were many lovely shops and restaurants to try out. Major disappointment was the Ponte Vecchio - too crowded and too many sellers flogging fake goods. Please dont' buy from here....go and find a real crafts person - it's what the city is about. A good leather shop with lovely people is Dantesca, Via Santa Margherita, 13/R....in front of Dante's church...and a lovely cheese shop!Most places to eat for lunch and dinner were found slightly off the main squares - generally the food was excellent with fresh pasta, and good service.My review is a little short and perhaps incomplete...and that's because Florence was so wonderful I'm going back soon to see more! Will add more soon."
50,“Florence experience”,"Recently visited Florence on a two city break. There were lots to see and do. Good food and wine. Lots of good shops. It was a most enchanging city by night. We found the Italian people to be both friendly and helpful. We stayed at La Residenza Del Proconsolo which was delightful. The staff could not have been any more helpful or courteous. We also visited Pisa but, after Florence, found it disappointing. We travelled to Lucca just outside Pisa and well worth a visit. Beautiful little town and only 20 mins by trian from Pisa."
40,“See and do in Florence”,"Being country folk ourselves we were pretty overwhelmed by the busy-ness of Florence. God forbid you step off the narrow sidewalk. You'll get hit by a bus/car/Vespa. But the Monna Lisa Hotel is set off on a very quiet street and, although our room had windows right over the street itself, we slept perfectly. The help was helpful, the breakfasts wonderful and the location perfect - just steps away from fabulous restaurants and all the sites you'd want to see. Don't miss taking Bus. No. 7 to Fiesole. And top notch restaurants are: Cibreo (sp?,) Italiano and the one right across the street that was voted, Top Ten in Tuscany. The name escapes me but the concierge will know - it means ""place where they store the carousel in winter?"" Great side trip - Sienna and SanGerminano (sp?). We did all the usual sights but wish we had time for the Bargello Museum - the old town hall and the archaeology museum. Be sure to get advance tickets for the Academia and the Uffize or go before 9:00. The lines can get long. We thought Christmas week would be light, tourist-wise, but we were wrong. It was full of families from all over the world. But our guides told us it was much better than spinrg-fall. And we did NOT get rained on once. Be sure to check out what concerts might be going on. The highlight of our four nights was a free concert at SS Apostoli church of Gregorian Chant. Can't get much better than that!"
30,"“Great museums, art, history; but smoky, dirty, crowded”","We tripped up to Florence from the place where we were staying in Tuscany, with fantastic expectations. We were excited to see the Uffizi and Accademia museums, to see Botticelli and Michelangelo originals, to explore the duomo and other historic buildings, and to experience the legacy of the Medicis.We went two different days: one to visit the Uffizi museum, and the other to visit the Accademia. On both days, we wandered around the city after museuming.The David at the Accademia is amazing and mesmerizing. There's not that much else at this museum, so allowing a couple hours is probably adequate for most.The Uffizi is an overwhelm. 45 rooms, crowded, amazing art, especially if you like Madonna and Child and other Christian symbology. After a couple hours, our feet were sore and our visual processing facilities were exhausted. Much to our chagrin, because the final location was a wonderful DaVinci special exhibit, and we were just too tired to see it. Then there's exiting the Uffizi. Stunningly, one walks through store after store after store before finally finding one's way to -- ahem -- fresh air. Bathroom usage at the Uffizi is an issue -- you need to head to the basement and expect a wait in line.Beyond the museum, we found Florence an extravaganza of street vendors selling leather goods, shops selling fashions, and cigarette smoke, diesel auto fumes, and crowds everywhere. Seeing the historic buildings was a treat, but we were both ready to exit the city quickly.Food was extraordinarily expensive in Florence.Driving in and out of the city was one of the few Italian driving experiences that proved uncomfortable during our two weeks there. It's easy to get lost.A tip: free all day parking at Piazza Michelangelo was easy, tho we dealt with massive traffic getting there (allow an extra hour). It's only a 15 minute walk across the Arno to get to the city from there."
50,“Absolutely gorgeous”,Florence is a must go for anyone that loves art and good food. My husband and I flew from london to Pisa spent one night then took the train to Florence. It is a great city and easy to walk around. Tip- Do not hire a car as there is a charge for entering the city and just nowhere to park. You don't need a car if you are spendiong your time in the city.
50,“Fell in love with Florence”,"Is there anything bad one could say about Florence? I really doubt it. Our family of four recently returned from our trip to Italy- Rome and Florence. We absolutely fell in love with both of these beautiful, special cities!! We walked and walked and walked all over both cities and cried and cried when it was time to come home!We are still crying actually. We stayed at the Hotel David of which I could write endless praises about. Our very favorite restaurant was a trattoria named GiGi's not far from Hotel David. We also loved a trattoria named Beppinos and a restaurant named Fagioli near the Uffizi. The Duomo is absolutely breathtaking. San Mineato Church is really worth the trek uphill that we made. The views from up there are to die for. The entire city of Florence is at your feet and the church is gorgeous. It is south of the river behind Piazza Michelangelo. To walk in Italy, we found, is to discover so many of its hidden jewels!!! Take every back street or side street that you can because you never know what you will find. The people there are as warm as they can possibly be. We never felt that we weren't wanted there. Our taxi driver (we decided to taxi to the train station when departing because of all our luggage- the ONLY time we used any transportation other than our feet!) was a hoot! He was firing off geography and political lessons in rapid, animated Italian of which I caught about half or less! We laughed and laughed! The weather was a little cool but only one day did we have a fairly all day rain-not hard rain but all day. We just pulled out the umbrellas and kept going. Florence is as beautiful to me on a rainy day as it is on a sunny day. It is one of those magical places that appeals to you as much in the day as in the night, cold weather or warm weather--it is too beautiful to stop glowing!!! We soaked in the ambience sitting on the steps watching people, walking the narrow streets with the merchants standing outside, smelling all the different wonderful aromas, eating gellati, of course. There was never a time when we felt threatened or unwanted. We can not wait to go back and I feel extremely fortunate and blessed that I was able to be there at least one time if that were to be my last time. My advice would be to take your time, walk-sit-listen-and just FEEL. A big part of my heart is still there. Thank you Florence for the wonderful memories- even the greatest poets that I have read have not been able to put into words the essence of your wonderful city and the people who live there. Grazie Mille."
50,“Intoxicating CIty of FLorence”,"We just returned from 14 fabulous days in Italy, 5 nights of which were in Florence!For those who have been there before, I am sure you will agree that this city is simply intoxicating. This was my second time, and my family's first time. What a blessing to share this with them. From its twisted cobblestone streets that lead you to the next surprise, be it a trattoria, gelato store, leather shop or museum, around every corner you will take in all of its charm. Our stay at the Pensione Pendini in Piazza della Repubblico shared the local flavor of this magnificent city, and its location and staff were unbeatable!! Just outside its doors you could hear at any given time the beauty of a solo violinist playing her music to the morning crowd, or on an evening stroll, the sounds from an opera singer resounding off the piazza walls as she performed to a small gathering on the corner near the flower stand. A day in this city can be as filled as you want, or as relaxing as taking in the Tuscany ambiance over a glass of wine and watching people walk by. But no matter what your stay is, make sure to visit Michelangelo's David at the Accademia, the Uffizi for art, (make advanced reservations to avoid long lines) or a stroll across the Ponte Vechio to gaze in the shops. A must do photo op is the Piazzale Michelangelo atop the hill across the Arno River. A taxi for a few Euros or a long walk will get you there, but Vivoli's for the best gelato near the Ponte Vechio is always a deserving treat afterwards. Speaking of deserving treats, the view atop the cupola of the Duomo is breathtaking; literally! It is a narrow, steep climb to the very top,(465 steps oneway) so fair of heart and people who are claustrophobic and afraid of heights heed warning. Just make sure you are in the right line, otherwise you will be automatically on your way up the winding staircase. Once you are outside at the very top, though, the 360 degree view of Florence is intoxicating!!!My motto for the Duomo: If you can ENDURE IT, DO IT! No matter what you do in Florence, take in a deep breath, slow down, and take in this city. As I said at the beginning, It IS simply intoxicating!! I have attached photos. enjoy."
40,“Loved the city!”,"I loved Firenze! It has a lot of places to visit, great food, awesome ice cream. What else can you ask for? :)"
50,“Magical time!!”,"I had a wonderful time during my week in Florence.I went alone and I planned to stay only in Florence and not visit other cities. People thought I was nuts, but I wanted to take the time to really see the city and have time to hang out at a cafe on a piazza and watch the world go by. And I did. So not only did I see what I wanted to, I had the time to relax so I wasn't overloaded by the end of the trip and in need of another vacation!The first thing I did after arriving (take an hour nap- then a shower and Dress up! It'll change your attitude) was take a walk to see the Duomo. The sight of it and it's massive size was just overwhelming! It totally changed my mood and made me happy to be there.I had dinner at Il Porcospino next to the Cappelle de Medici. All the waiters chip in and take care of you. Being a Blonde American, I might have gottena little extra attention ;-), but hey, you have to let go and enjoy yourself! The food was delicious!The next day I had 10:15am reservations at the Uffizi and I spent the entire day there. I can't understand how people can runt hrough it in an hour. There are major works of art there that deserve to be seen and savored. I did have lunch on the roofdeck cafe (GREAT views!) and went back and saw some more paintings. TAKE YOUR TIME!!! you shouldn't rush through this amazing museum.Dinner was at Gilli on the Paizza de Repubblica. Paolo was a consummate waiter and took care of me. Just watching all the sights and listening to the classic violin being played was exhilarating. Order the Proscuitto and Melon there. It melts in your mouth!The next Morning was the Galleria d'Accademia. Seeing David when you turn that corner is a heart-stopping moment. It's quite something to see what you've looked at in books all your life looming in front of you ! The other rooms contain Church pieces from the 13th and 14th centuries. It's fascinating to study. Upstairs, they had a special exhibit of Russian and Greek ikons that were really cool. Give yourself two hours here.The shoes in Florence are to die for!!! My favorite store was Calzoleria Bologna and DiVarese.Later that night, I went on a ride on a motor Scooter with a new friend to the Piazza de Michaelangelo. If you go late enough, there are many Italian University kids hanging out and playing guitar. They don't get trahsed like American kids, so there is no puking or fighting. It was fun to be there at an hour when other tourists aren't.I walked all 414 stairs of the Bell Tower at the Duomo. If you get there by 6,7 or 8pm, you can feel the bells ringing under your feet. DO bring your camera, because you'll want to take pictures of the views.If you just want to see the inside of the Duomo, and not go on a tour or walk those stairs, go into the church entrance and say you're there for mass or to say a prayer. You can still see the beautiful Cuppola. Make sure your shoulders are covered, otherwise they will make you wear a hideous smock.The Boboli Gardens are great for a picnic. There are 60 stray, but friendly, cats that live there. They love to play and snuggle with the tourists. I spent the afternoon havign so much fun with them, I never made it inside the Pitti Palace!! But it was worth it!The Medici Chappelle behind San Lorenzo church is also quite breathtaking. there are etchings ont eh wall from Michaelangelo. Make sure to ask for them, since they are not clearly marked, you can miss them. The coolest thing , I thought, were the reliqueries. here were these beautiful works of art that contained finger or femur bones of various saints in them. Kids will love that!!Drinks on the rooftop bar of the Grand Hotel Baglioni are a must!! As is the Hot Chocolate at Cafe Rivoire! And the Spagnulo (black cherry) Gelato!!San Miniato has better views than Piazza de Michaelangelo because it's higher. Take the #12 bus there. They also have Vespers every night at 5:30pm in the Summer and 4:30pm int he Winter. It's in the little chapel downstairs adn it's magical. The monks do Gregorian chants and it's just amazing to close your eyes and listen. There is also a full mass, so be mindful of the genuine worshippers that are there. the rest of the church, especially the graveyard, is also beautiful.Lunch at Mercato Centrale is a must! There are stands that sell lunch and you can sit at tables or stand at the counter. Find Nerod's and have the Zuppa de pomodoro!! It's also great to buy bread, cheese, meats and olives for a picnic lunch!Finally, a trip to Fiesole is a must. Once again, my motor scooter friend took me there, but there are buses. Pack a picnic lunch and enjoy the views!!So take your time and really experience this beautiful city! Leave time to shop on the Ponte Vecchio and other streets. Dont' cheat yourself by rushing through it like so many tour groups do. You'll regret it!!And if you're alone, don't worry. Everybody is so friendly, you'll be making new friends.I'm ready to move there!!!!! :-)"
50,"“Great Food, Fun and People”","Florence has got to be one of the most beautiful places to go in Italy. I began exploring Florence on my own because my travel buddy had already been and didn't want to do the same things over again. So, I began my journey to see what every tourist goes to Florence to see: the David. It was much bigger than I expected. TIP: Make sure to make an appointment, otherwise you will be in line even longer than you already are. While exploring Florence, I met several other tourists and locals that were the nicest people I have met in Italy. A few locals my friend and I met at the bar across from our hotel brought us to a local festival that few tourists go to. It's always nice to see the other side of the city - the non-tourist Florence. I never knew the name of the festival, but it begins in July. Also while there I had some very good food. If you go to the main square, not by the Duomo, but by the hotels, go down the alleyways and you can find some excellent restaurants."
50,"“Florence, beautiful quarter of Santo Spirito !”","My girlfriend and I were so lucky to find a very central, weekly rental accommodation in one of the most beautiful and popular quarters of Florence -- Santo Spirito – where we rented an apartment for a whole week. We saved so much money this way. We have been planning this trip for a while and thought we could never afford a room in one of the over-priced Florence hotels. Instead what we got was a real “Room with a View” -- the rooftop view from the apartment, overlooking a charming narrow street, with a glimpse of the Santo Spirito bell tower and the cupola of the Duomo, were just great. In fact, we woke up every morning to the tolling of the bells of Santo Spirito, instead of the usual sirens or garbage trucks back home in NYC. The Oltrarno area, where the apartment is situated, if Florence’s “left bank” of sorts, and it has so much to offer in terms of art galleries, restaurants, cafes, bars and artisan shops. After a few days of exploring its streets and discovering so many great cafes, enotecas (wine bars), flea markets and antique stores, we felt like locals. What Florence hides behind its famously austere face, it more than makes up for with delightful, one-of-a-kind shops and restaurants. And I haven't even mentioned the museums! After an ""hard day” browsing the many world-class museums and monuments, beginning of course with the city’s crown jewel, the Uffizi Gallery, it’s very relaxing to finally drop by the down the street trattorias and watch the street life. In case you couldn’t tell, we really loved it, and I recommend this experience to everyone. It was a great alternative to a conventional tourist experience, it's like ""living Florence"" instead of just visiting it."
30,“Give it a day then get out of town!”,"Florence is a great city with a lot of great history. The architecture is interesting, the winding streets are fun and driving is a rush! Getting some gelato on the Ponte Vecchio is also a fun deal. The museums are numbing though. Not being a fan of religious rennaisance art, most of it was a yawn to me. However, even a pagan luddite like me had to marvel at Michelangelo's David. Pay the 10 euro and see the big, naked man of marble. Better than everything in the Ufizzi combined in my opinion.Choose restaurants carefully. Find a nice cafe and try that. We found the more upscale we went, the more disappointed we were.We also found Florence dirty, full of Americans, and a little sketchy as the sun went down - especially around the train station. No - we weren't hanging around there, it was between downtown and our great hotel (Starhotel Michelangelo).But do go there and do get out of town. Rent a car and go to Sienna and other Tuscany towns. This is where it's at. For the real adventurers, go east instead of south. Not too touristy, you'll end up in places where nobody speaks English but everyone is friendly. What a blast."
40,“Breathtaking Art--Don't Leave Italy Without Seeing!”,"EuroStar Train Tickets are 29.50 Euros and you should buy them ahead of time (even from American Express Travel Office in Piazza de Spagna). Trip takes 1:35 minutes and a taxi cost about 6.50 Euros to take you to the Academy Museum to see Michelangelo's David (8.50 Euros). At the end of January, we didn't need reservations here or at the Uffizi. Flea Market on Saturday is great for souvenirs! The Duomo, Baptistery, Bell Tower, and the huge Uffizi Museum (8.50 Euros) are all within walking distance, but pace yourself. And, you must wear comfy shoes! You can even be back in Rome to eat dinner and go to the Opera."
40,“love the city”,The city of Florence is BEAUTIFUL. We stayed at a hostel about 2 blocks- the Residence Millenium. Very clean and conveniently located.Just about everything is within walking distance in the city. Very clean and the people were all friendly. Do watch for pick pocters as they are plentiful in all of Italy.
50,“Florence is wonderful”,"Spent a week in Florence in mid Feb. Fewer crowds, weather was chilly but warmer than Connecticut. Rented a small apartment right in the center of town. Had been there before in the summer. Went this time with wife and 29 year old daughter. My wife understands a lot of Italian although for the most part English will get you by. It is really hard to describe Florence, there is so much art and architecture. It is so small, everything is well within walking distance. There is actually so much it can get overwhelming and a day off in the middle of the week is not a bad idea. Rent a small car and use that day for a trip to Siena, Lucca, Pisa, or any # of other towns within about an hours drive. Driving on the main roads is fine, the cities are fairly nuts but we are originally from NY so we know how to deal w traffic and insane drivers. We plan on going back in a year or 2 especially if we can get the whole family (4 kids +?) on board, that would be truly wonderful"
50,“Loved living in Florence”,"I lived in Florence for 89 days while teaching in a study abroad program. I especially appreciated the following: The central market a few blocks west of San Lorenzo church for a real look at how Florentine's shop for food. We shopped there almost weekly. Mercato Nuovo on Via Calimala, a few blocks north of the Ponte Vecchio, for good prices on gifts of leather, wool, silk, stationery. The taxi service. Souvenirs from the stands near Piazza della Repubblica. You can reserve a taxi by appointment, or walk to a taxi stand and wait your turn. The bus and train systems. Be sure to validate your ticket in the machine to avoid a fine. Plenty of internet stations. My favorite was Internet Train. The friendliness of most vendors, restaurateurs, especially if you try parlare un poco italiano. The unique Stibbert Museum (armor!), small restaurants with home cooking.Rick Steve's guidebooks help you save $$$$ with 3 star hotels that are quite adequate for those on a budget. The Edison bookstore on Piazza della Repubblica sells lots of guidebooks and dictionaries in every language. English language movies at the Odeon cinema Monday nights.Fare una passeggiata all around the center of Florence in the evening.The amazing talent of window dressers. Ready access to ATM machines.Trip by train and bus to Collodi, home of Pinocchio's author. Not easy.Stay the night in Montecatini and get directions from the tourist information system. Saturday night in Montecatini is an amazing sight; everyone, but everyone hangs out in the central piazza or window shops.Discovering the city of Orvieto and its cathedral, underground cellars and passageways. WEAR A MONEY BELT everywhere in Italy! Keep a small amount of cash handy for quick purchases. Men, DON'T carry a wallet in the obvious places like your pockets. I was never robbed, but a couple of Americans I know were. Guys, never try to sneak out of a bar without paying--you could get beaten up. Prepare for your trip by building up your walking stamina. Locate the tourist info centers and get a bus map and a few tickets from a tabacchi or newstand. Keep handy for a nice ride around Florence for people watching. Don't forget the Oltrarno district across the Arno. Ask for the ""lift"" in museums if stairs are too much. The secret of the fabulous thick cioccolata con panna is a little starch in the cocoa mix. the cocoa is steamed like cappucino.Vanilla extract doesn't exist. The local wine doesn't ship well; enjoy in situ. Avoid the men sitting on the street with large dogs; may be drug dealers. Stand to consume food and drink at local caffeterias, pasticerias, etc., or you'll have to pay a service fee. Look for the Lush natural soaps store. The leather in some shops was reported in a recent National Geographic as being made under sweatshop conditions.Mosquitos are year round; use the ""vape"" repellent vaporizers in your room,they work. Take extra batteries for any camera; extra digital disks, film. Anything hi tech, like computer disks, etc., costs much more there. Pegna market sells international foods. Ask the locals about restaurants. Don't eat at Ristorante il Bargello-the worst food we ever had, and bad food is hard to find in Italy. Also don't eat at La Vie en Rose, ditto, and odd. We were appalled by the sexist abuse of women by a street performer on weekend nights east of Piazza della Repubblica. Keep a diary as well as photojournal every day. I am forgetting the names of favorite restaurants a year later unless I read my diary. Carry back packs in front, don't use wheeled backpacks-streets too bumpy and crowded. Carry shoulder bags across body, not on one shoulder. Keep a few 20 eurocent coins handy to ward off beggars, or just avoid eye contact completely. ""Basta"" means ""enough!"" the Box Office a few blocks beyond the Santa Maria Novello train station sells tickets for concerts. Read art books or take an art course if you can first. Be prepared to forge ahead when walking; no one yields if you are too polite. I loved my stay and feel homesick for Florence and other parts of Tuscany. Try to fly into Florence airport from Paris-it is small and easy to cope with. Take a taxi from there, or a bus Florence near Santa Maria Novella train station. Taxis are not allowed to solicit your business in Italy; use only taxi stands or your phone reservation. All of Florence goes on sale in Mid-December for pre-holiday post-tourist sales. Summer is hot; winter is very cold; weather is like New England without snow. Above all, enjoy. To ensure a return visit, rub the nose of Il Porcellino bronze boar behind Mercato Nuovo market, then have a gelato at Il Porcellino gelateria nearby. Say hello to Bilal, who likes to play hip-hop music over the sound system.Above all, be open minded and go with the flow. Oh, yes, bistecca fiorentino! A porterhouse steak grilled to perfection over charcoal, I believe, basted with lemon juice and olive oil. Or a rib steak served with fresh chopped tomatoes and olive oil on top. Risotto, yum! The basic bread, a light colored, heavy, whole wheat bread, has no salt in it. It's best use in my opinion is as the base for the next day's ribollita, a ""reboiled"" dish made with the bread, vegetables, beans, and the local black cabbage. It tastes best in the small local restaurants, especially with good olive oil poured over it. You can buy cookbooks in English to ship or take home. Internet Train and other centers will ship your wrapped packages home; it's worth it to use them, insure the package, too. Also, pay for the express postage if you want your postcards to get home, otherwise they are not a priority to the postal service."
50,“I loved Florence”,"Just came back from our first visit to Italy, we felt in love with Florence, is full of art, beautiful buildings and excellent food. I loved walking through his narrow streets, specially at night after most group of tourist were gone. Galery Uffizi and Galery of the Academy of Art are a must!! and of course drinking a capuccino in one of the charming caffes."
50,“Hermosa ciudad”,"Fui con muchas expectativas a Firenze y todas fueron cumplidas. CIudad 100% renacentista, bien conservada y tranquila."
30,“A faire avant d'aller à Venise”,"Beaucoup de gens sont exaltés par Florence. J'y ai passé une journée et fait les principales places de la ville. J'aurais voulu faire le parc, mais malheureusement un arbre était tombé et donc le parc était fermé.J'ai fait Florence lors d'un séjour à Pise, mais surtout peu de temps après avoir visité Venise. La ville est très bien, mais rien à voir avec la richesse de Venise. Du point de vue architecture, il y a énormément à voir. On a vu le Piazza Lorenzo, la San Giovanni et Del Duomo, celle Della Republica, Della Signoria, Le Pont Vecchio, la P. Dei Pitti et on a trainé dans les rues avoisinantes. C'est très beau, mais rien à voir avec ce qu'il y a à Venise, où l'on retrouve les mêmes expériences, mais beaucoup d'autres en plus et en mieux à mon goût - tous les gouts sont dans la nature bien sûr.Petite remarque pour ceux qui feront le voyage en train, il faut valider son ticket dans des bornes vertes de la gare après l'avoir acheté, sinon on a une pénalité de 5 à 40€ dans le train, par ticket...mais ça évidement vous ne l'apprenez que quand le contrôleur vous sort son PV en vous disant qu'au dos du billet il y a un site web à visiter avec les explications - comme si quand on achète un ticket on va sur internet pour voir comment on l'utilise, un vrai piège pour touriste."
30,“Nada especial”,"Hacer un paseo en Ferrari es una experiencia inolvidable en cualquier lugar del mundo. Pero me parece que el lugar menos indicado para hacerlo es en Florencia, una ciudad que es el polo opuesto a lo que significa Ferrari, una ciudad antigua, con mucha historia es mas coherente recorrerla en un carro tirado por caballos o en un vehículo antiguo y dejar la Ferrari para ciudades mas modernas"
50,“Magnifica”,"La adoro ..è uno spettacolo..passeggiare tra quelle meraviglie m'ha fatto fare un viaggio in un altro mondo..misterioso e affascinante. Il tramonto al ponte vecchio e il crepuscolo agli Uffizi accompagnato dalla dolce musica di un artista di strada, sono cose che difficilmente dimenticherò."
50,“Una ciudad espectacular!!!”,"La gente muy amable, la ciudad bellísima. Si les gusta el arte no dejen de visitar los Uffizzi, el Palazzo Vecchio, el Palazzo Pitti y Santa Croce"
10,“Peggior cena”,"Ci siamo recati in questo ristorante convinti dal cameriere che stava all'ingresso ma anche se siamo stati accolti con garbo il cibo è stato pessimo, crostini di pane completamente bruciato e la nostra pasta stracotta. Roba da turisti."
50,“Приятный город”,"Спокойная и релаксирующая обстановка, приятно прогуляться по набережной. Интересная архитектура. Для осмотра минимум два дня!"
40,“Туристическая Флоренция”,"Планируя отдыха в Италии, естественно было решено заехать в этот чудесный город Тосканы, в ее столицу.Сразу можно сказать, что город красив, да, но на 1 квадратный сантиметр туристов больше, чем камней, брусчатки и прочего расходного материала на дорогах или зданиях!Чтобы увидеть всю Флоренцию в ее красе, необходимо остановиться в городе на 2-3 суток.Но давайте не об этом.Хочу вам рассказать о местных магазинах с кожей.Дорого, очень дорого и модели очень страшные, даже не так, не знаю кто придумывает дизайн с перфорацией на куртках, но это выглядит ужасно и такие куртки стоят от 400 евро.Да, скидку сделают аж евро на 200-300, но если им сказать, что только зашли и нужно осмотреться еще, сразу цена станет изначально озвученной.Мне все это напоминало рынок с навязчивыми продавцами.Рынок продуктов прекрасен, но если вы живете в деревеньке, то покупайте все продукты в местных лавках и магазинах, во Флоренции вы потратите денег в 2 раза больше.При подъеме на площадь Микеланджело вас могут остановить парни, которые собирают на лечение наркоманов деньги. Попросят 40 евро. Не ведитесь и сразу поднимайтесь вверх, игнорируя их.Ну и обязательно не забудьте посмотреть на данный мост Понте-Веккьо. Внутри моста продают сувенирную продукцию."
10,“Peggior drink”,"Prima di cena ci siamo fermati in questo pub per un semplice aperitivo, ma era così fatto male che c'è bruciato lo stomaco per ore saltando addirittura la cena. Da denuncia."
50,“magnifique”,"une très belle ville que j'ai à peine découvert en 2 jours, mais j'ai hate d'y retourner: la cathedrale Santa MAria del Fiore, le Duomo, le Palazzo vecchio sont iincroyablement beaux"
50,“Приятное воспоминание!”,"Ездили во Флоренцию из Римини, сама поездка очень приятная и запоминающаяся, старинные мосты, горы - очень красиво. Во Флоренции посетили собор Санта-Мария дель Фьоре, посетили старинный рестаранчик. Лазанья со стаканчиком Кьянти, а потом гуляли по прекрасному городу вдоль реки Арно, Ну и конечно же незабываемый вид с видовой площадки на весь город."
30,“A Firenze per vedere l'arte si paga ovunque.”,"Firenze è una gran bella città d'arte, ma occorre avere un notevole portafoglio, per poter visitare tutti i musei e le chiese.Occorre incentivare la cultura con biglietti più economici."
50,“che meraviglia”,"in pieno centro storico la vera fiorentinita'...mangiato in qsto posto nn proprio economico ma davvero buono , ottima l,idea della pasta fresca....poi se ti guardi intorno .....sei a FIRENZEEEEEE"
40,“Une ville pleinne de charme”,"Séjour de 4 jours en plein mois d'août, Florence est une ville d'un charme fou!!!S'y balader est un régal, même si les touristes sont nombreux à cette période il ne faut pas hésiter à déambuler dans les rues. vous y trouverez des galeries d'arts gratuites attendant que vous.Les visites du Duomo, des galeries et palais sont à prévoir dès l'ouverture où en fin de journée (certains sont ouverts jusque 23h).Un peu déçu du manque d'explication pour les visites sans audio guide (surtout que les écriteaux sont seulement en italien ou anglais).La ville est encore plus belle quand la nuit est tombée et que tout le monde est à l'hôtel. C'est une œuvre d'art à elle toute seule et vous pourrez contempler sa beauté plus calmement."
50,“Pranzo al Mercato Centrale”,"Una SPLENDIDA riqualificazione. Io non c'ero ancora stato, ma credetemi è veramente FORTE.Vi straconsiglio lo stand della pasta fresca. ECCEZZIUNALE VERAMENTE!!!!!!Andateci assaggiate e poi vedrete, anzi Sentirete"
50,“La piazza delle piazze”,"Il cuore storico di Firenze dove confluiscono cultura, politica, arte, gastronomia e tantissimi turisti. Da non perdere."
40,“Magico”,Firenze è strepitosa è una città che ti rapisce.Questo ristorante in centro è molto buono offre sicuramente tanta qualità e la possibilità di mangiare in un posto straordinario.Unico neo non è molto economicoLo consiglio
40,“Da incanto!”,"Una città senza dubbio che merita. Merita di rimanere anche qualche giorno qual'ora si volessero visitare tutti i posti che mette a disposizione. Tra giotto,michelangelo,brunelleschi... Il posto che preferisco è PIAZZALE MICHELANGELO, facilmente raggiungibile che il bus che fa capolinea alla stazione di Santa Maria Novella! ci metterò qualche minuto forse anche un a 20ina.... Ma ne vale la pena. Se sapete di cosa sto parlando,è come il gianicolo a roma,nel senso che da li si può avere uno scorcio romantico della città!"
50,“Linda!”,"Cidade belíssima, cheia de charme, com pessoas muito educadas e simpáticas. Vale a visita, vá ao Duomo, a ponte Vechio, faça um city tour panorâmico, é perfeito. Volterei em breve!"
50,"“Excelente!Cuna del Renacimiento! Obras de Miguel Angel, Donatello, Da Vinci, Boticelli etc”","Florencia es muy hermoso! Increíble en obras exquisitas. uno puede apreciar contrucciones impresionantes como las del Duomo, reliquias muy valiosas y obras de MIguel Angel, Boticelli, Brunelleschi,Da Vinci, Donatello. No hay que perdérselo. Tiendas para compra de ropa de muy buen gusto y dependiendo de la fecha los precios bajan bastante. También se puede hacer compras de lujo en Louis Voutton, Prada, Gucci, etc. Está ciudad fue la capital de Italia en la época del Renacimiento y tuvo muchísimo poder ! Tanto así que los florentinos la consideraban el Paraíso."
50,“Cidade Muito Bela”,Uma cidade com varias opções para turismo. As galerias e Igrejas históricas são encantadoras. Para as compras existem as lojas das grandes marcas.
50,"“Невозможно забыть этот город и всё,что там находится!”","Вчера ездила на экскурсию во Флоренцию. Флоренция -уникальный город Италии! Расположен на границе двух областей Италии-Тосканы и Эмильи, пересекается рекой Арно. Этот город вдохновлял таких мастеров изобразительного искусства, как Донателло, Микланджело, Леонардо да Винчи, Сандро Батичелли и многих других. В центре города расположен знаменитый собор Санта Мария дель Форе. И этот великолепный купол Брунелески, доминирующий над городом. Облик города мало изменился с течением веков. Великолепие дворцов и церквей завораживает вас с первых минут пребывания в этом городе, а узкие улочки так и манят заглянуть в каждый уголок. Сюда хочется вернуться вновь и вновь! Мне очень понравилось во Флоренции. Приезжайте сюда и не пожалеете!"
50,“cidade acolhedora”,"Firenze - Florença - é uma cidade aconchegante e de grandes obras. Berço do Renascimento, se pode conhecer obras de grandes artistas da época. Lugar que não se deve deixar de conhecer."
40,“linda”,"Cidade linda, como é julho, está bem movimentada, muita gente jovem nas ruas, muitos locais acolhedores para comer, muitas vitrines com pizzas, doces, sorvetes.Arquitetura antiga, linda."
50,“patrizia a Firenze”,"Fra le città più belle nel mondo sicuramente Firenze la si potrebbe mettere al 4° posto. E stupenda in tutti i sensi. Con i suoi maestosi monumenti, le sue bellissime chiese, le sue bellissimevie, la consiglio a tutti per una vacanza indimenticabile"
50,“Bellísima”,"Una de las ciudades más espectaculares de Italia y del mundo. Se respira arte y belleza en cada rincón. Una visita imperdible al Duomo, las calles, el Ponte Vecchio y ésta Basílica como cada barrio. Una experiencia única"
30,“sans grande conviction”,certes très jolie ville rien à redire sur les monuments qui sont magnifiques mais sans eux la ville perd de son charme les ruelles sont comme tant d'autres dans des villes. les stars en font des éloges mais elles ne doivent pas faire le vrai tourisme. les boutiques de luxes ne présentent pas de belles et alléchantes vitrines. florence ne serait pas ce qu'elle est sans se monument et sa réputation pour ma part c'est une ville parmis tant d'autres dans laquelle j'ai passé une journée qui m'a couté très cher en parking et j'ai trouvé fort désagréable tout ces vendeurs de contrefaçons qui vous arrêtent constamment. je me suis même enfuit des lieux touristiques pour voir une autre facette de cette ville mais rien de transcendant.de plus les restaurants et bar proposent des prix exhorbitant
50,“Città straordinaria”,Firenze è favolosa come poche città al mondo. Un contenitore d'arte e storia che è affascinante e che almeno una volta nella vita bisogna visitare
30,“Довольно интересно”,"Мы были компанией, нам понравилась программа, если это можно так назвать. Приятно поразило то, что официант понимал русскую речь и делать заказ было одно удовольствие. Также в холле можно было сфотографироваться, примерив мантию :) Вечер получился весёлым :)"
40,“io che ci vivo”,"Firenze, una città magica che molti percorrono solo per musei, chiese o monumanti storici. Ma Firenze è molto di più! Sapevate che molte delle strade che si dipanano nel centro storico hanno una storia alle spalle? I loro nomi derivano da fatti, eventi (a volte misteriosi o tragici) che ci riportano indietro nel tempo. Procuratevi la guida ai misteri di Firenze e lo scoprirete!! Se poi volete mangiare ""alla fiorentina"" non potete perdervi il ristorante Magazzino in Piazza della Passera. Oltre a mangiare bene è collocato in uno degli angoli più suggestivi della mia città!!"
50,“un tuffo nella storia”,"Piazza della signoria, piazza santa croce. il ponte vecchio, la cattedrale di santa Maria del fiore, il forte belvedere, piazzale Michelangelo e potrei continuare ancora ma non riuscirei a menzionare tutto il patrimonio artistico di questa meravigliosa città. In ogni angolo di Firenze si respira storia, cultura, ovunque tu volga il tuo sguardo non puoi che restare meravigliosamente incantato, Firenze è un museo a cielo aperto. Tutta la toscana è bellissima ed è una tappa obbligatoria per ogni turista."
50,"“Firenze, il fior fiore delle meraviglie”","Una bellissima città, ospitale, spiritosa, ricchissima d'arte e di monumenti. Visitare il centro storico, chiuso alle auto, è un piacere: negozi ovunque, prodotti locali e tanto artigianato. Si mangia benissimo un po' ovunque. Fra tutti cito il tipico ristorante toscano <Il Latini> e l'eccellente Osteria di Giovanni, entrambi offrono i piatti tradizionali e gustosi della vecchia Toscana. Poi, per i giovani, la famosa discoteca Space Electronic: divertimento assicurato per tutti.Firenze, la città delle meraviglie!Renzo Vatti"
40,“la mia firenze”,be è la mia città e quindi posso spendere parole buone per negozi che abbiamo all altezza di milano e roma divertimenti quasi ok l'unica nota stonata è il traffico la zona ztl e i parcheggi
50,“Magnífico”,"Adoramos Florença!! Uma cidade que recomendamos vivamente...O estilo medieval dos edifícios, as galerias de arte, as lojas de antiguidades.... É tudo magnífico! Em Roma e Veneza é uma loucura com tantos turistas, enquanto em Florença, apesar de existir turismo é muito mais calmo, mais limpo.... Enfim.... tudo tem requinte e glamour!!"
50,“Grazie Mille!!”,Volevo ringraziare tutto lo staff di questo ristorante! I nostri clienti sono stati entusiasti per il fantastico pranzo che hanno fatto ieri e per la caccia al tartufo che era stata organizzata per loro nella mattinata. Si sono diveriti tantissimo e hanno mangiato divinamente! Good job!
40,“ótima cidade!”,"Um ótimo lugar para se conhecer, de dia pode se dedicar aos lugares históricos, e a noite aos restaurantes que mais tarde se transformam em animadas boates, pqninas, mas bem animado memso, as lojas fecham mais tarde e a cidade é bem movimentada."
50,“Tolle Stadt”,Fuhren mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel ins Zentrum. Die Ponte Vecchio ist einen Besichtigung wert. Toll ist auch der Blick auf die Stadt von der Basilica di San Miniato al Monte.
50,“BAR A VIN LE VOLPI e l'Uva PIAZZA DEL ROSSI A FLORENCE”,"Un pur bonheur, de qualité tant sur les vins que pour la charcuterie et les fromages.Un couple charmant et accueillant, et les conseils précieux de la patronne qui en plus parle très bien le français.nous avons passé une super soirée"
50,“Firenze - Jun-2013”,"Tem tudo que a Italia tem de bom,steak a Fiorentina,é tão bom que é vendido por quilo,tem o melhor sorvete do mundo,com certeza não há melhor em nenhum lugar,os super torrones com pistache,castanhas...,Em volta da praça da matriz tem muitos restaurantes e lojas de doces incluindo a loja da Chocolates Lindt que vende chocolate a granel,a cidade cheira molho de tomate o que mantem todo mundo com fome o dia inteiro.Em termos de passeio ver o por do sol e o anoitecer na ponte Vecchia é algo de muito bonito,comprar uma joia é muito importante dizem que da sorte,tem uma grade na praça no meio da ponte que é cheia de cadeado,dizem que se o casal colocar um cadiado e fechar juntos,depois jogar a chave no rio que passa abaixo,faz o casamento durar para sempre,só que se a policia pegar o casal é multado em 50 euros.A igreja matriz é muito bonita,subir na cupula ou na torre é muito interessante´,só precisa tomar muito cuidado porque a escada é de pedra e não tem muita ventilação,que tem fobia pode sentir mal.A cidade tem o tempo todo a alegria da Italia,muito bom,imperdivel."
40,“Ottimo cibo bellissima atmosfera”,Secondo noi è da provare questo ristorante tipico di Firenze. Si mangia davvero bene e l'atmosfera e calda accogliente ...sembra di essere in una casa! Il servizio e davvero curato e in più c'è anche una bella terrazza dove si può trovare un po' di fresco anche nelle giornate calde. Noi lo consigliamo
50,“Ristorante in centro a Firenze anche per non turisti”,"Dalle colline senesi siamo scesi a Firenze, vicino alla Basilica cercavamo ""solo"" u panino ed una bibita ma non riuscendoci ci siamo ""accontentati"" di un ristorante a pochi metri dalla Basilica e siamo rimasti sorpresi dal Caminetto dove abbiamo trovato una terrazza fresca, pulita e ben esposta, un servizio eccellente e dei piatti curati e saporiti.All'occasione torneremo certamente con piacere."
40,“endroit agréble”,"Très bon accueil, cuisine simple, service avec le sourire, restaurant située en face du Palais Pittipas l'impression d'être pris pour des touristes (ce que nous sommes)très belle carte de vins avec des vins en bio dynamie"
30,“Florens-historiskt och turistiskt”,"Florens har man alltid hört är så fantastiskt så det är ett måste. Blev dock lite besviken till viss del, kanske beroende på hettan den dagen som gjorde att det luktade illa både här och där i staden. Det finns en del riktigt vackra byggnader, den stora katedralen var fantastiskt vacker på utsidan- men ett tips ha kläder nedan för knät och täckta axlar om ni vill kunna gå in, vilket dock kan kännas jobbigt när det är +37 grader i skuggan. Ponte Vecchio var också roligt att se och lite speciell. Vi besökte trädgården till Palazo Pitti som skulle vara så vacker- den var en besvikelse, mest grusgångar och buskar.Ett annat tips. Se upp med glasspriserna om ni köper glass i Florens, det kan bli otroligt dyrt om man ej kollat upp det innan man beställer, 15 euros för en stor bägare lösglass är i dyraste laget då man på andra håll kunde köpa ungefär samma mängd glass för mindre än halva det priset.Vill man besöka sevärdheterna och gå in, så kostar det."
10,“risparmiamola...!!”,"Firenze!! Sono tanti anni (circa 22) che periodicamente , per lavoro e qualche volta per piacere, mi reco in questa (una volta..) bellissima città. L'impressione degli ultimi anni, è di un declino e di un ""eccessivo utilizzo"" di Firenze, che oggi più che mai si presenta , soprattutto in centro, sporca, trascurata, soffocata da un traffico fatto di scooter ""violenti"" e da un numero esagerato di autobus e di qualsiasi altro veicolo in grado di portare un numero sempre maggiore di turisti, che ogni giorno (so di circa 300 bus quotidiani...)intasano una città che soprattutto in estate è sicuramente al collasso di presenze.La città , che sicuramente può offrire tantissimo, si presenta come una bottiglia da 75 cl di ottimo vino, in cui si vuole fare entrare un'ettolitro di vino scadente... Tutti hanno senz'altro diritto a visitare qualsiasi posto al mondo, ma tutti hanno anche diritto di trovare posti ben curati e un'accoglienza ben diversa da quella che si trova a Firenze, città a mio giudizio, diventata ""SCORBUTICA"" con chi invece è traino principale dell'economia. Bisognerebbe potere visitare la città, probabilmente, più nei mesi ""off season"" e forse si riuscirebbe a ritrovare qualcosa di quello che , sicuramente, adesso non c'è più."
30,“Trop chère”,"Il y a beaucoup à voir dans cette ville mais il faut toujours avoir la main au porte-monnaie même pour entrer dans une église! Et que dire du parc Boldoni pas entretenu, les arbres pas taillés, le Belvédère inaccessible, aucune pancarte pour indiquer le chemin et en plus il faut débourser 10 euros pour le visiter.Les musées se réservent par internet on évite des queues monumentales mais le prix est différent aussi 11 euros tarif avec queue 19 euros en réservant cela fait quand même une sacrée différence !!!!!!!!!!"
50,“Como descubrir Florencia y no morir en el intento”,"El mes pasado visitamos Florencia. Cuando llegamos nos dimos cuenta de la gran cantidad de cosas que se pueden visitar. La verdad es que el primer dia nos sentimos un poco desorientados ya que no sabiamos por donde empezar. Tuvimos la suerte de haber contactado antes de viajar con una guia oficial española. Los dos días que nos acompañó fue de una gran utilidad y todo un acierto ya que pudimos visitar muchísimos lugares y no tuvimos que hacer ni un minuto de cola en ningún museo, ya que ella nos había hecho la reserva con anterioridad. Fue la manera más acertada de aprovechar los días que estubimos en Florencia.Slivia, que es como se llama la guia, nos acompañó a los lugares más destacados y nos aconsejó que podiamos visitar por nuestra cuenta. El tiempo que nos dedicó fue mucho mayor al que habiamos previsto, pero nos cobró lo que habiamos acordado en un principio. Aparte de ser una excelente guia es una excelente persona. Si visitais Florencia y pensais en buscar una guia yo os la recomiendo sabiendo que será todo un acierto. Podeis contactar con ella por internet en www.florenciacat.com y vereis como es un gran acierto."
50,“MARAVILLOSA CIUDAD”,"Florencia es una ciudad preciosa con un encanto especial, pasear por sus calles de día o de noche es una maravilla"
50,“Florencia”,"Florencia és una ciudad encantadora , por sus monumentos sus iglesias su comida sus helados su gente , por todo . Estuvimos en Séptiembre y nos encantó , la Plaza del duomo , el campanile , el mercado de San Lorenzo extensísimo el ponte vechhio , que és un puente lleno de joyerias , és una pasada ,la plaza de la señora que hay varias estátuas y entre ellas está el David de Miguel Angel , todo en Florencia és a lo grande, las plazas los monumentos las catedrales etc. la comida buenísima tanto la pasta como las pizzas de frutti di mare ( buenísimas ) los helados fantásticos , el tiramisú excelente la gente super amable , en fín nos vinimos encantados y nos gustaria volver"
50,“città UNICA!”,"quest'anno siamo tornati nella splendida città di Firenze per la seconda volta. per pasqua, volevamo evitare il caldo di luglio della prima esperienza del 2010. questa volta abbiamo scelto di dormire in città, l'anno prima ci siamo spostati nel villaggio di Fiesole. Fiesole è una buona soluzione per evitare l'affa fiorentina. abbiamo visitato il Museo del opera del Duomo, non è molto famoso ma è BELLISSIMO, con la splendida Maddalena di donatello, un'emozione incredibile. poi abbiamo fatto un giro città in bicicletta con una giovane guida Fiorentina, Filippo, che organizza questi giri un piccoli gruppi, eravamo 5 amici. la bicicletta è un'ottimo mezzo per visitare il centro. l'hanno prima avevamo fatto il tour con il bus rosso a due piani: DA EVITARE!!! costa tanto e non si vede NULLA, perchè non entra nel centro storico. consiglio questa città, la prossima volta vogliamo tornarci fuori stagione, tipo al inizio di marzo."
50,"“bela,bella e bella”",Città romantica non grandissima e per questo facile da visitare!Ha molte vie a Zona a traffico limitato e quini attenzione io sono stata sfortunata e ho dovuto pagare......Gli albergatori che si trovano in quelle vie però vi forniscono un permesso appena gli fate presente che siete muniti di auto quindi per i giorni successivi non avete problemi.Dovete sicuramente visitare gli uffizzi e passeggiare sotto i tanti portici.Per gli amanti dei gioielli ponte vecchio è il posto giusto per voi.Non è economicissima ma ne vale la pena.Per me dopo Roma e la città più bella d'Italia.
40,“Schöne Stadt in der Toscana”,"Florenz ist eine sehr schöne Stadt in der Toscana und man sollte unbedigt einen Abstechen machen wenn man dort in der Nähe ist. Sehr interessant fand ich die alte Fleischerbücke, die nun mit zahlreichen Gold-schmuck geschäften ausgestattet ist.Man kann die Brücke nicht verfehlen, von ort aus kann man direkt zum shoppen in die Innenstadt flanieren. Man braucht auf jedenfall etwas gedult um einen Parkplatz zu finden aber mein Tipp, lieber ein bisschen weiter weg, dann wird es günstiger."
40,“Immer eine Reise wert”,"Wer zeitlich nicht gebunden ist, sollte seinen Florenz-Besuch in die Vor- oder Nachsaison legen, dann bleibt man von großer Hitze und vor allem von langen Anstellschlangen weitgehend verschont. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten im Stadtzentrum lassen sich nahezu alle zu Fuß erreichen. Zur berühmten Michelangelo-Terrasse hoch über der Stadt fährt auch ein Bus. Von hier hat man einen fantastischen Blick über die gesamte Stadt."
40,“No me importaría vivir en Florencia.”,"Fantástica ciudad. Hemos estado cuatro dias y no hemos podido ver todo lo programado.Saliamos a las 08.00 del hotel y no regresábamos hastala medianoche.Sus museos, sus barrios, las iglesias, las terrazas,los alrededores, ""i gelatti""!."
50,“Florencia es uno de los lugares más románticos que he conocido”,"Es la combinación perfecta entre cultura, arte, comida, gente joven y paisajes, es tan hermosa que ninguna foto podría retratar la belleza de su arquitectura, no hay nada más hermoso que ver el atardecer desde la Piazza Michelangelo."
40,“Wedding In Florence”,Posizionato perfettamente e ottimo servizio. Personale estremamente gentile. Consiglio vivamente l'Hotel Cosimo de Medici.GrazieAntonella
40,“欧洲文艺复兴的发祥地，“大卫”像 - 巴哲罗博物馆”,佛罗伦萨的建筑我不是特别喜欢，但是许多博物馆的镇馆之宝却是多得数不尽，在巴哲罗博物馆排了3个小时的队，才有机会瞻仰了“他”一眼。
50,“TRES IINTERRESANT ARTISTIQUEMENT”,"La ville se visite entierement à pied, ce qui est tres agréable.c'est un musée a ciel ouvert, églises a couper le souflle, profusion de statues , de tableaux magnifiques, Aa mois de mars, les prix était raisonnables dans les restaurants et l'hotel.pas d'attente a l'entrée des musee.tarifs corrects."
40,“sehr schöne Stadt”,"Zu erreichen z.B. mit einem Billigflieger nach Bologna, dann mit einem Bus vom Flughafen zum Bahnhof (Kostenpunkt ca. 5,- EUR) und weiter mit der Bahn nach Florenz (Kostenpunkt ebenfalls ca. 5,- EUR). In der Nähe des Bahnhofs gibt es gute preiswerte Hotels. Die Stadtmitte mit vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten kann von hier aus zu Fuß erreicht werden."
50,“Firenze mozzafiato”,"Scendi dal treno e già capisci che Firenze ti piacerà. Attraversi la piazza di fronte alla stazione di S. Maria Novella e ti dirigi al Tourist Point per farti dare la piantina della città e farti dare le prime indicazioni per come arrivare al tuo Hotel. Ma una volta liberi dai bagagli, dirigetevi verso la chiesa di S.Lorenzo dove poco distante c'è un caratteristico mercato pieno di bancarelle con tanta pelletteria tipicamente fiorentina di buona fattura, funzionante anche la Domenica. Da lì il tour continua arrivando a pochi passi dal Duomo transitando per Piazza San Giovanni e dall'altra parte non dimenticatevi di S. Maria del Fiore, un trittico di monumenti di una bellezza assoluta. Imboccate la Via de Calzaiuoli e in 5 minuti si arriva a Piazza della Signoria con Palazzo Vecchio e la Galleria degli Uffizi con già dalle prime ore del mattino i turisti in fila per la visita di rito. Ponte Vecchio e le botteghe orafe è lì dietro e sull'altra sponda dell'Arno c'è Palazzo Pitti ed il suo caratteristico piazzale in pendenza. Tornando indietro su Ponte Vecchio, costeggiate il lungarno sulla destra fino a Via de Benci, infilatevi per lo stretto Borgo S. Croce per ritrovarsi la Basilica di Santa Croce, maestosa e piena di significati storici non solo legati a Firenze, da visitare con attenzione assoluta. Se si ha ancora un po' di tempo, percorrendo Via de' Pepi si arriva nel quartiere ebraico di Firenze per visitare la Sinagoga ed il Museo Ebraico. Da lì, cartina alla mano scegliete un qualsiasi itinerario per tornare in centro passando nelle stradine dove troverete anche qualche bel localino dove mangiare un boccone."
50,“Ciudad encantadora y artística!...”,"Ciudad encantadora y artística!...Dante Alighieri, Macchiavello, Galileo Galilei están enterrados en la célebre iglesia de Santa Croce en Florencia; ver sus tumbas emociona. Es una iglesia-museo con una plaza del mismo nombre.....Florencia es encantadora, llena de arte; merece la pena pasear por sus callejuelas, y aún por sus calles más contemporáneas, tomarse un vino y deleitarse la vista, mirando il duomo, il campanile, el baptisterio y la porta del paradiso...mucho arte!...recorrer il ponte-vecchio es una experiencia especial...Florencia es una joya, y vista la ciudad desde piazzale michelangelo es algo que no se te va a ovidar!!."
40,“firenze ma non per tutti”,"Bella città, ma decisamente inadatta per bambini o comunque per famiglie con bambini al di sotto dei 12/13 anni.Decisamente ricca di cultura e arte, che per i bambini può diventare noiosa e priva di divertimento.prezzi medi di ristoranti, cibi, alberghi, sopra la media. la qualità è troppo altalenante.meno sporca di genova, ma rimane piena di stradine, vicoli e vicoletti troppo sporchi per essere vissuti con disinvoltura.consigliatissima per un weekend romantico o per un weekend all'insegna dell'arte.sconsigliata per tutto il resto."
50,“Culla della lingua italiana”,"Firenze fa parte del patrimonio artistico unico dell'italia. Dovrebbe essere preservata e valorizzata meglio ma i luoghi e lastoria, i musei e i palazzi storici sono veramente inimitabili. Oltre alla citta vale la pena di visitare anche le fantastiche colline intorno alla citta.da non perdere"
50,“Nur außerhalb der Hauptsaison”,"Um eines vorauszuschicken: Florenz ist wegen der angenehmen Temperaturen (fast) ein Ganzjahresziel und man sollte den Besuch nicht unbedingt in die Hochsaison legen. Wir waren Ende November da, trafen auf eine nicht überfüllte Stadt und konnten ohne langes Warten in alle Sehenswürdigkeiten. Diese sind von einer Unterkunft im Stadtzentrum aus nahezu alle zu Fuß erreichbar. Zu der über der Stadt tronenden Michelangelo-Terrasse führt man bequemer mit dem Bus. Ein Geheimtipp für Sportliebhaber ist der im November stattfindende Florenzmarathon, der in seiner Streckenführung alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten einschließt."
50,“Kunststadt”,"Museumsfreunde kommen auf ihre Kosten, auch wenn der Besuch nicht immer leicht gemacht wird (langes Anstellen bei Kassen): es empfiehlt sich den Besuch gut im Vorhinein zu organisieren und zB. Tickets schon im Internet zu kaufen (Uffizien, Palazzo Pitti). Die herrliche Altstadt mit dem Dom und den beruehmten Plaetzen muss man einfach erlebt haben. Kommt man mit dem Zug an, ist man praktisch auch schon da und wird gleich vom Zauber der Stadt umfangen: eine empfehlenswerte Anreiseform!"
30,“Le problème de Florence”,"Bonjour à tous,Après un voyage de quelques jours en Italie dont 1 journée à Florence malheureusement pluvieuse au mois de mai 2010, nous avons reçu 2 contraventions pour passage dans une zone réservée aux résidents (précision: aucun panneau remarqué.) Le montant total s'élève à 150 euros). Le problème est que vous n'êtes pas verbalisé de suite donc vous pouvez répéter l'erreur indéfiniment. Certains reçoivent une dizaine d'amendes à qq minutes d'intervalle car c'est une caméra qui vous prend après coup.DOnc avis à tous les touristes choisissant l'italie comme destination: méfiez vous de leur système de verbalisation qui peut vous coûter très cher au retour et vous dégoûter définitivement de l'Italie. Promenez vous sur internet pour vous rendre compte du nombre de personnes qui ont subi ce problème. Scandaleux!!!!"
50,“una vez en la vida hay que ver florencia”,"Yo estuve de viaje de novios, y nos lo habían recomendado antes, pero siempre lo dejabamos para más adelante, y que bien que hicimos pues fue el viaje perfecto como luna de miel, pues es una ciudad preciosa y con un mucho encanto, todo su arquitectura, su gente, comer es algo caro pero ya que se va hay que disfrutar en la medida de lo posible de todo.Tiene mucho que ver además de la arquitectura, también la galería de los uffizi, y respecto al David de miguel ángel podéis ir a verlo a la Galería de la Academia pero hay una reproducción similar en la Piazza de la Signoria.Nosotros visitamos también Lucca y Siena (NO VISITARLOS ES PECADO) y Pisa (solamente tiene la Piazza dei Miracoli con la Torre inclinada, el Duomo, el Baptisterio y la piazza dei cavalieri, por lo demás no ofrece mucho más arquitectónicamente, si no lo visitas no te pierdes mucho, eso si en 3 o 4h lo has visto todo incluido callejear por toda la ciudad).VIAJE MÁS QUE RECOMENDABLE Y MUY MUY MUY ROMANTICO :)"
30,“Gute Idee wenn man viel Geld hat”,"Ich wuerde nicht Florenz an Familien empfehlen oder junge Leute mit kleinem budget, hotels and hostels sind TEUER sowie das essen und trinken.Falls man an eine romantische Urlaub interessiert ist oder Renaissance und Mittelalter viel liebt wuerde ich Florenz nicht empfehlen"
40,“Interessante Stadt”,"Florenz ist sicherlich für die Uffizien bekannt, aber auch andere Museen sind einen Besuch wert, daher sollte man sich informieren und je nach Interesse auch die kleineren Museen aufsuchen. Die Preise in der Innenstadt sind sehr teuer, das heißt vor allem beim Essen sollte man genau hinschauen und vergleichen. Je weiter man aus der Innenstadt draußen ist, umso billiger wird es."
40,“翡冷翠”,佛罗伦萨很小，我们去了圣母百花大教堂。教堂的外墙绘画着各种不同的花的图案。远看，犹如穿了一件花衣裳。登上钟楼可以俯看整座城市，但是四百多级的台阶要一步一步走上去。穿过城市中心，到了河边，可以看到旧桥。很出名，很拥挤。手工的皮制品，要比罗马便宜，值得一买。机场真的有够小。
50,“Firenze”,"Cosa posso dire, per me è una delle città piu' belle del mondo, l'atmosfera è eccezionale, come tutta la Toscana, cibo ottimo, ma sempre meglio farsi consigliare, musei da urlo partendo dagli uffizzi, dove si trovano pitture superlative, ma tutto e' bello, chiese, ponti, palazzi,...tutto, consiglio prima di andarci di leggere qualche libro di storia sul rinascimento italiano e storia dei Medici, dopo ce la si gode ti più, ma attenti alle multe, occhio ai sensi unici"
50,“Che meraviglia...”,"Firenze è una città magnifica. Estremamente pulita, elegante, chic. Non c'è il caos delle metropoli, ma respiri ovunque l'aria di una città che ha vissuto i fasti della capitale. Profuma di storia ma è anche molto contemporanea: i mercatini, le boutique di lusso, il cibo fantastico, il calore della sua gente la rendono unica. E' solare e crepuscolare allo stesso tempo. Più classica che moderna. L'ideale per ogni turista che voglia fare un bagno di cultura, ma godersi allo stesso tempo la spensieratezza di una città vivace e godereccia. Ti consente di alternare una passeggiata sul lungarno e un pomeriggio di shopping a una visita al David di Donatello o ai dipinti del Botticelli custoditi nella Galleria degli Uffizi. Non capita ovunque. Da visitare assolutamente."
50,“embrujados al instante”,"desde que pisamos la hermosa ciudad de florencia,quedamos fascinados por sus edificios y construciones, sus palacios, plazas,y calles. Es volver al medievo, a la época antigua. Es respirar cultura y arte por los cuatro costados. Solo fueron 2días que dieron para poco, pero prometemos volver."
40,“firenze esperienza sensoriale”,"firenze è stata vista in 48 ore ma 2 giorni fatti di un momento di passaggio di lavoro, dove avevo tempo per godermi una città ancora non vista...avendo così poco tempo ho deciso di dedicarmi solo alla zona storica, dove giotto ha lasciato i segni e ai suoi ristorantini intorno, una passeggiata di poche ore ma intensa, fatta di odori della strada meravigliosi, scambi linguistici presenti in ogni angolo, fotografie di persone una diversa dall'altra, tutte insieme che coloravano la zona vecchia come una cartolina di altri tempi, una città dove bisogna tornarci al più presto per poter rivedere e vedere cose nuove, sicuramente con sorprese...ma soprattutto per poter rimangiare ad un ristorantino scoperto vicino al ponte. FIRENZE vista con gli occhi di un turista per caso con poche ore a disposizione"
50,“La culla mondiale dell'arte”,"La perla della Toscana, l'invidia di tutta Italia..Firenze!Nessuna città come Firenze, racchiude in cosi poco spazio cosi tanto da vedere. I suoi musei offrono opere d'arte che spaziano dal Rinascimento fino a tutto l'800. Gli Uffizi, il Bargello, Palazzo Pitti, la Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Palazzo Vecchio, Duomo, Battistero, Il giardino di Boboli, lo Stibbert, il Museo della Scienza, Il campanile di Giotto, Ponte Vecchio..sono solo pochi accenni di quello che offre la città.Inoltre..non possiamo scordarci di sottolineare la cucina tipica della regione che ospita Firenze..LA TOSCANA!La bistecca alla fiorentina annaffiata da un Chianti d'annata, è uno dei piatti piu caratteristici di quest'angolo di Toscana.E per i piu giovani..Firenze non può non essere al pari degli standard europei quando si parla di vita notturna. Numerosi sono i locali dove poter trascorrere la vivace notte fiorentina."
50,“la cultura allo stato puro”,"la gente,il cibo e la cultura che si traspira...basta questo per venire!"
50,“值得一游”,意大利很美，夏天度假的不二选择，可能跟学的专业有关系，建筑历史，满街皆是美景。宏大的遗址，震撼人心。古老的教堂，昏暗的光线，凹龛里的壁画，无一不让人流连忘返。圣母百花大教堂人好多，排半小时队只为一睹布鲁乃涅斯基的墓碑。小礼拜堂的庭院太美，一时无言。乌菲兹怕是每天都去也不厌，可惜匆匆过尔。
40,“La città che mi è rimasta nel cuore”,"E' bella in qualunque periodo dell'anno, è sempre pulita e curata."
50,“Un lugar con mucho encanto”,"Me parece una ciudad con una belleza enorme, a cada paso te sorprende con algo nuevo. Mucha vida en las calles, unos helados buenisimos y muy buena gastronomia. La Plaza Michelangelo es una parada obligatoria si quieres una panoramica preciosa de la ciudad."
50,“uno dei posti piu romantici”,Citta splendida e ricca di cultura.
50,“Firenze - Città d'arte”,"Come accennato nel titolo Firenze non è una delle tanti città d'arte ma è il punto di riferimento a livello mondiale dell'arte rinascimentale; da qui l'appellativo culla del rinascimento.Praticamente ovunque è possibile trovare opere degli artisti di quel tempo.Negli Uffizi si trovano pitture di Giotto, Cimabue, Della Robbia, Verrocchio, Da Vinci e il Botticelli con la sua celebre Venere.Nella piazza principale è possibile trovare molte opere del Brunelleschi prima tra tutte la Cupola del Duomo.Il più importante ricordo che ha lasciato Michelangelo è il David. L'originale è preservato nell'Accademia delle belle arti, ma altre due copie si trovano in piazza della signoria e nel piazzale ad egli intestato.Le meraviglie di Firenze non finiscono qui, molte sono le chiese, i ponti, i palazzi, le ville, i giardini, i parchi... tutte cose che scoprirete visitandola."
50,“Florenz”,"Florenz mit Ihrem Mittelalterlichen Stadtkern, den historischen Plätzen, Palästen und Museum ist zu jeder Jahreszeit eine Reise Wert. Wir hatten das Glück direkt im Stadtzentrum eines kleinen Familienhotels zu wohnen und die Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuss zu erreichen. Stadtrundfahrten mit dem Omnibus, Erkundigungen zu Fuss - was wünscht man sich mehr bei einer Städtereise. Wir hatten den Monat Februar ausgewählt und uns dadurch lange Wartezeiten bei den Museen und Galerieen erspart. In den Sommermonaten gibt es Anscheinend sehr lange Wartezeiten. Anmerkung: Falls möglich sollte man für diese Stadt 5 Tage zur Besichtigung einplanen, es lohnt sich auf alle Fälle."
20,“non mi è piaciuta”,"grigia, sporca, affollatissima e con i dei topi abnormi del fiume cn la gente seduta dentro.. uno schifo assurdo se non fosse per le belle opere d'arte, statue, costruzioni.. belle prese singolarmente ma in un ambiente che.. non mi è piaciuto per niente, ci sn stata in camper e c'era solo un parcheggio sul fiume dentro ad un grandissimo mercato molto conveniente.. ma non prendere la porchetta! troppo speziata.. :D"
50,“Kultur PUR”,"Wir waren nur für 30 Stunden nach Florenz gekommen. Die Stadt mit ihrer Kultur und dem toskanischen Flair hat uns aber sofort in ihren Bann gezogen. Wir haben uns ein Mietauto genommen. Das sollte man aber nur machen, wenn man nicht sehr an seinem Leben hängt. Für einen Besuch sollte man mindestens ein langes Wochenende einplanen.Eine der schönsten Städte der Welt."
50,“Kultur pur und dazu italienische Lebensfreude”,"Die größte Stadt der Toskana bietet einige weltberühmte Sehenswürdigkeiten, welche natürlich bei keinem Florenzbesuch fehlen dürfen. Dazu gehört die Kathedrale Santa Maria del Fiore und die Uffizien. Von der Piazza Michelangelo kann man einen herrlichen Ausblick auf die Stadt genießen und beim Durchgang durch die Kirche Santa Croce findet man die Grabstätten so mancher berühmter Persönlichkeiten der Geschichte (z.B. Amerigo Vespucci). Alles in allem ist Florenz sicherlich eine Reise wert, die auch über ein Wochenende hinausgeht. Wenn man viel Zeit hat, empfiehlt es sich zudem, auch das malerische Umland der Toskana zu bereisen."
50,“また行きたい”,ミラノやローマも良いですが、フィレンツェもなかなか良いと思います。個人的には前の２つより都市っぽくなくて、情緒もありつつ、観光・ショッピング・食事とバランスよく楽しむことができるところだと思います。街を散策するのにもとても良いところでした。海外旅行に慣れてない女２人でも、思いきり動きまわれました。有名どころのドゥオモやウフィッツィ美術館ももちろん良かったですが、そこまでメジャーでなくとも魅力的なところがいっぱいあるので、行く前に下調べして行くのが良いと思います。私はサンタ・マリア・ノヴェッラ薬局という、世界で最も古い薬局に行けたのがよかったです。日本よりも安く買えるというのもありますし、なによりその建物に入れたのが感動。すごく雰囲気あってよかったです。
40,“大卫啊大卫”,作为文艺复兴时期的重要基地，即便没有一点的艺术细胞，在佛罗伦萨的街头趟佯几圈，也是会受些熏陶的。虽然大卫像的街头复制品颇有几个，但排队等上个把小时去看一眼真品还是很值得的，不亲眼一见，确实无法感受其带来的震撼。
50,“冷静と情熱のあいだ”,この町へ行くときは、映画　冷静と情熱のあいだ　　のＤＶＤか本を読んで行くことを薦めます。私は、本と映画を観て、感銘を受けて訪れましたが、実際に町を歩くと、映画のシーンが思いだされ、非常に楽しく町を歩くことができました。
50,“中世ヨーロッパの面影を残す街”,花の都と称されれているフィレンツェは中世の面影をそのまま残した町並みがとても美しいです。ドゥオーモ、ウフィッツィ美術館、アカデミア美術館、ピアッツァレミケランジェロなど見どころが満載の都市です。町の中心を流れるアルノ川の対岸ピアッツァレミケランジェロから見下ろすフィレンツェの街並みは最高でした。
50,“冬場のフィレンツェの移動”,２０１０年12月の情報冬場のフィレンツェの移動は注意が必要です。正確な気象情報を入手、早期の行動判断が必要です。２０１０年12月17日頃のヨーロッパの大寒波の影響でフィレンツェにアクセスする周辺の高速道路Ａ１の出入口は17日夕方 未明から18日10時頃まで全て閉鎖されていました。12月18日朝8時頃のネットの高速道路情報は全線開通と有りましたが、現状は一致していませんでした。（開通が2時間程遅延）12月17日夕方未明 カパンノリ ルッカからフィレンツェに向かうＡ１は高速出口も閉鎖され下りられず。翌朝4時頃迄 車中に過ごし到着は6時を過ぎていたそうです（後日、ツアー添乗員談）12月17日20時頃 ベニス方面から移動していた我々は、ボローニャ駅側でホテルを確保して宿泊して翌18日午前8時出発しましたが、フィレンツェへの峠を越えた当たりの除雪作業が進んでおらず、ﾌｪﾚﾝﾁｪ到着は16時を越えていました。
40,“Traumstadt in der Toskana”,"Es wäre traumhaft im Sommer durch die Straßen von Florenz zu schlendern, wenn nicht diese Touristenmassen wären! Aber abgesehen davon, ist es wirklich super schön. Wenn man es liebt alte Kirchen und Klöster anzuschauen, ist es eine Reise wert. Man sollte unbedingt auf den naheliegenden Hügel wandern um die Stadt von oben zu betrachten, das ist wirklich schick! Das einzige was man nicht tun sollte, ist sich ein Eis kaufen, da fällt man bei den Preisen um!"
50,“不得不去的地方”,意大利的托斯卡纳，一定是众多游客的梦想之地。佛罗伦萨绝不会让你失望。爱看博物馆的，可以在这里看到吐。街头随意的门廊都是大师的作品，餐风露宿的雕塑，都让你忍不住止步景仰。爱吃美食的，街边小店的披萨就足以让你垂涎三尺，冰激凌之琳琅满目更是前所未见。更不用说那肥美鲜香的T骨牛排，一块都在一公斤以上，烤到正好断血，周边稍见焦黄，切开粉嫩肥美，即使不是肉食爱好者，也绝不会轻易放过。配上来自托斯卡纳乡间的醇美葡萄酒，在点着烛光的餐厅里面，来一次你终身难忘的美食饕餮吧。
50,“雰囲気最高です”,イタリアで一番好きかも。建物と建物の間の細い石畳の道を歩くのがお気に入りです。すべて歩いて回れる範囲のため、非常に活動しやすいです。食べ物もトスカーナ牛ステーキが最高で、じっくりと牛のうまさを堪能できます。ウフィッツ美術館はかなり並ぶので朝一をおすすめします。
50,“Die Stadt der Romatiker”,"Florenz ist eine Stadt für Verliebte. Die Stadt strahlt soviel aus. Es gibt dort viele kleine und große Brücken, so dass man von vielen Teilen einen tollen Blick auf die schönen Gebäude hat. Neben dem Dom und den anderen bekannten Sehenswürdigkeiten, empfehle ich einfach durch die schönen Gassen zu laufen und sich die Fassade anzuschauen. Wir sind mit dem Auto hingefahren, wobei das Befahren der Innenstadt nicht ratsam ist. Es gibt auch auch gute Flugverbindungen. Um Ostern ist die schönste Zeit"
50,“ルネッサンスの街。”,フィレンツェは言わずと知れた花の都として、日本人にはとても人気がありますね！そう大きくはないこの街に、これだけ多くの見どころがあるのですから、まさに街全体が美術館と言った趣です。私が特にお勧めするのは、サン・マルコ美術館です。ここには、フラ・アンジェリコのフレスコ画がたくさんあり、中でも素晴らしいのは受胎告知です。建物も修道院をそのまま使っているので、とても雰囲気があります。もちろん初めて訪れるのでしたら、ドゥオーモとウフィツィ美術館ははずせません。特にドゥオーモのクーポラには上って欲しいと思います。冬でも汗だくになる程の急な階段ですが、頂上に上った時の感動はひとしおです！
50,“Kultur und Flair”,"Florenz ist für alle die Kultur lieben eine Reise wert. Wir hatten ein Hotel etwas außerhalb und sind mit dem Zug hingefahren, das erspart die lästige Parkplatzsuche. Unbedingt zu empfehlen ist ein Stadtrundgang, auch alleine mit dem Reiseführer, hier gibt es schon sehr viele Bauwerke und Paläste zu bestaunen. Die Öffnungszeiten der Kirchen sind unterschiedlich, unbedingt nachlesen. Mich hat am meisten das Museo di San Marco beeindruckt. Lieber 2-3 Tage für die Stadt einplanen, man hat mehr davon, als einen Tag vollzustopfen,"
50,“アウトレット”,ローマの後に訪れたのでとても小さな街だなぁと思いました。ホテルのすぐ近くにドゥオモがあったので登りましたが、先頭になってしまい途中休憩なしでハイスピードで一気駆け上がったので、思っていた以上にきつくって、屋上では風景を満喫するどころじゃなかったです。ゆっくり自分のペースで登られることをお勧めします。郊外のアウトレットは日本では考えられないくらい安くて、また行きたいです。
50,“世界遺産の町”,フィレンツェは町全体が世界遺産であり、とても素敵な町でした。夕暮れ時はまた一段と素晴らしい景色が堪能できます。また、観光名所はほとんど歩いて回る事ができます。バスを利用しても便利かもしれません。
40,“フィレンツェの歴史地区”,フィレンツェには２泊３日で行きましたが一日はピサへ行っていたので実質１泊２日の観光でした。クーポラと鐘楼は登らない理由はないでしょう。世界遺産に登録された町並みを見る事が出来ます。特にクーポラでは内側の絵も間近で見る事ができるのでお薦めです。そしていつ行われるのか、何が行われたのかわかりませんが、私がいった時は、ドゥーオモの前に芝生がしかれて、ダビデ像が移動されてライトアップされていて絶好の撮影ポイントでした。そして鐘楼正面にあるBLACK BARというお店でピザやジェラートを買って食べている人が多かったです。私もピザを食べましたがおいしかったです。他にもウフィツィ美術館は有名な絵を多く展示していてとても見ごたえがありました。フィレンツェにはコインランドリーが多くあってバックパッカーの私はとても助かりました。どうやら駅には不法滞在者が多いとのことなのでスリなどに注意して行動してください。
40,“Wunderschöne Stadt”,Florenz ist eine wunderschöne Stadt und wirklich eine Reise wert. Es gibt viel zu sehen und man kann schnell ein Wochenende mit Sehenswürdigkeiten füllen.Möglich ist zum Beispiel auch ein kurzer Bustrip nach Pisa zum schiefen Turm und ähnliches.In Florenz unbedingt den Blick auf die Stadt neben der David Statue geniessen!!!
40,"“an jeder ecke geschichte, kultur und menschenschlangen”","Wer die langen Schlangen meiden will die es vor jeder Attraktion zu jeder Jahreszeit gibt, sollte vorreservieren oder zb auf den geräumigen Platz Piazzale Michelangelo ausweichen. Dieser ist oberhalb der Stadt mit schönen Ausblick auf das Zentrum und den Fluss. Vom Zentrum aus kann am Fluss flussabwärts (richtung westen) entlang von autofreien Alleen sich auch von den Stadtstrapazen mit Laufen/Jogging erholen."
50,"“Klassiker, den man gesehen haben muss”","Für Kulturfreaks führt kein Weg an Florenz vorbei, aber auch Kulturbanausen werden fasziniert sein von dieser Stadt am Arno. Hier sollte man unbedingt eine Hop-on-hop-off-Bustour mitmachen, die auch ans andere Ufer des Arno führt. Dort an der großen Davidstatue hat man von einer großen Panoramaterrasse einen einzigartigen Ausblick auf Florenz.Mit dem Auto sollte man möglichst vorsichtig einen Parkplatz am Rand der Innenstadt ansteuern, im Zentrum selbst kann das Autofahren in der Rush-Hour zum Albtraum werden.Ansonsten ist es aber herrlich durch die Straßen zu flanieren.Vorsicht: In vielen Lokalen und Eisdielen werden Touristen hemmungslos abgezockt. Wir waren so blöd und haben vorher nicht nach dem Preis gefragt, eine normale Kugel Eis kostete dann 4 Euro. War zwar gut, aber der Preis eine einzige Frechheit."
40,“Florence musée à ciel ouvert”,Florence est une ville magnifique où à chaque coin de rue nos yeux sont ébahit par des monuments et immeubles à l'architecture florentine remarquable. Les statues de Michel Ange à la Galleria sont absolument incroyable.Une ville à visiter absolument à n'importe quelle saison
40,“見所多く美しい街”,世界遺産に指定されているフィレンツェ歴史地区には　ウフィツィ美術館はじめ　宮殿や庭園、教会など見所も多い上、ピサまでは鉄道で1時間ほど、日帰りもできるので観光の拠点として　しばらく滞在するにも便利な都市です。
50,“イタリアでお気に入りの都市”,こんにちは、2回目の投稿になります。今まで22カ国行った中で一番気に行った都市は、イタリアのフィレンツェです。フィレンツェには2回行った事があり、1回目はバスでフランスからミラノを経由してフィレンツェに行き、2回目はローマから車で行きました。電車は使った事が無いので、ローマからどのくらい掛かるのかは分かりません。フィレンツェには美味しいレストランや美術館等たくさんあり、街並みもとても綺麗な街でした。レストランは中華料理や日本食のレストランもあるので、イタリアンが飽きたら行ってみるのも良いかもしれません。ミラノやローマ等大都市にも、中華料理や日本食レストランがあります。フィレンツェの観光名所は歩いて回れますが、ミケランジェロの丘は離れているのでバスかタクシーを使った方が良いです。「どうしてもお金を節約したい」という方は歩いていっても良いですが、かなり距離があると思います。イタリアのカフェはどのお店も雰囲気があるので、歩き疲れたら店内で飲むのも良いしテラスに出て飲むのも良いです。フィレンツェから少し足を延ばせば、ピサに行く事が出来ます。日帰りで行けるので、時間に余裕のある方は行ってみて下さい。
40,“美しい街並み”,ミラノから向かいましたがミラノの都会風とは違い、作られたようではありますがヨーロッパの旧街並みがとても美しかったです。歩いて回れる小さな町の中にウフィツィ美術館、サンタ・マリア・デル・フィオーレ大聖堂、ヴェッキオ橋など歴史的建築物を見ることが出来ました。食べ物も値段的には少し高いかと思いますがどこで食べても美味しかったです。２日間で見どころを見ることができましたが次回はもっと時間をかけて行きたいです。
40,“Une ville riche en art”,"C'est avec un ravissement que j'ai pu découvrir cette ville le temps d'une journée. Beaucoup de monuments à visiter, hélas... Je n'ai pu que visiter 2 ou 3 choses. Cependant l'ambiance générale de ville, bien que très touristique vous vous en serez douté, est très agréable. Et je vous invite à y faire un tour lorsque les beaux jours d'été reviendront ! (je ne sais pas à quoi ressemble la ville en hiver !)"
50,"“Florencia, flor de la Toscana”","Florencia es una ciudad preciosa, pequeña pero llena de cosas que ver. La zona que más me gustó fue la Piazza della Signoria y alrededores y la zona del Duomo. Recomiendo subir a la cúpula porque las vistas de la ciudad son impresionantes. Merece la pena visitar el museo de los Ufficci aunque sólo sea para quedarse embobado viendo a Venus flotar en su concha o a la Primavera con su vestido verde salpicado de flores."
40,“mi ciudad favorita en ITALIA”,"Para mi la ciudad más bonita de Italia es, sin duda, Florencia. No hay ningununa otra en la que se combinen arte y cultura con tal elegancia y estilo. Belleza por todas partes, cada calle, cada monumento refleja un estilo particular, único."
50,"“Florenz, die Perle in der Toskana”","Florenz, die einstige Hauptstadt Italien, besticht immernoch durch ihre Autentizität, eine echte Alternative zu Rom, die als DIE Vorzeigestadt Italiens und als MUST gilt. Vielmehr ist Florenz eine Perle in der Toskana, vor allem für ""Essbegeisterte"", das Essen dort ist weltklasse.Kaum ist man etwas ausserhalb des Zentrums, erblickt man die Schönheit der toskanischen Hügel, ist schon mitten im Chianti und Ölivenölgebiet, ein Schmaus für Augen und Gaumen.Allerdings sollte man Florenz nicht im Hochsommer besuchen, da es dann unerträglich heiss ist, Viel eher eignen sich Herbst oder Frühling, alleine sein wird man allerdings auch dann nicht.Etwas gefeilt sein sollte man vor den Strassenverkäufern, die einem gefälschte Ware andrehen wollen, jedoch relativ schnell verschwinden, wenn die Polizei aufkreuzt.Auf jeden Fall sollte man sich einfach mal durch die Gassen treiben lassen um sich plötzlich einem verwinkelten Grotto wieder zu finden. Einfach einzigartig!PS: ein absoluter Einkaufstipp: Lederwaren!"
50,“une ville a y aller absolument”,"ville suberbe, une excellente cuisine et une très belle région"
50,“Schön aber zu viele Leute”,"Toskana ist überall schön aber Florenz, Siena und Pisa sind meinen favoriten Städte. Ich habe immer in Zentral Hauptbahnof mein Auto geparkt und manchmal ich bin von hier mit meinem Fahrrad gegangen in Zentrum. Santa Maria Novella ist die erste Kirke in der nähe den Bahnof. Dann die Kathedrale kommt und endlich die Uffizi und die Vecchio Brücke. Von oben können Sie schönes Bilder haben wenn Sie nach San Miniato fahren."
50,“Beeindruckende Stadt in Mittelitalien”,"Leider hatte ich wieder einmal schlechtes Wetter gebucht für das Sightseeing in einer Stadt. Trotzdem konnte mich Florenz auch im Regen beeindrucken, nicht auszudenken also wie der Eindruck ausgefallen wäre bei strahlendem Sonnenschein. Florenz zeichnet sich allgemein durch eine unglaubliche Fülle an Kultur aus. Unteranderem die Medici-Familie finanzierte unzählige Künstler die beeindruckende Werke erschuffen. Hierbei dürfte jedem zum Beispiel der David von Micheangelo einfallen. Aber auch die Ponte Vecchio ist unbedingt zu besichtigen, insbesondere wenn man sich noch die Zeit nimmt die unzähligen Juweliere auf der Brücke näher anzuschauen. Ebenso der Piazzo della Signoria mit einer Nachbildung der Davidstatur und dem Palazzo Vecchio. Hier schließen sich auch die Uffizien an, für welche man alleine schon Ewigkeiten braucht um sich alle Kunstwerke in den Medien anzuschauen. Und natürlich darf auch zum Abschluss auch eine Besichtigung des Doms nicht fehlen. Ich werde Florenz auf jeden Fall noch einmal einen Besuch abstatteten, diesmal hoffentlich aber bei besseren Wetter."
50,“tolle Stadt insesondere für Liebhaber von Kunst der Renissance und Kirchen”,"Tolle Stadt mit vielen schönen Sehenswürdigkeiten, vorallem Kirchen. Einfach mit einem Reiseführer bewaffnet durch die Stadt schlendern, es gibt so viel zu entdecken.Es gibt viele schöne Märkte, insbesondere den Ledermarkt mit tollen Waren.Einen schönen Ausblick auf die Stadt hat man von dem Hügel auf der anderen Flußseite.Unbedingt mehrere Tage einplanen."
50,“Florenz ist sehenswert”,"Da ist so viel zum schauen .Wenn man Gedult hat und sich rechtzeitig anstellt kann man ins Uffizi reinschauen.Die Goldschmiede auf der Brücke sind auch toll.Mir hat ein Gitarenspieler auf der Brücke sehr gefallen.In den Studenten Viertel habe ich die beste Fischsuppe gegessen .Leider ist alles sehr teuer geworden,aber mann finndet immer etwas kleines als Errinerung immer."
50,“florenz....die urmutter der italienischen städte”,"was ist nicht alles schon geschrieben worden über diese stadt....besonders positives...und auch ich kann mich da nur anschliessen. die sehenswürddigkeiten kann jeder selbst im reiseführer nachlesen. mein tipp ist das erkunden der westseite der stadt mit den vielen kleinen nicht überlaufenen restaurants, innenhöfen und typischen toskanischen pensionen---auch mal was für den kleineren geldbeutel ;)falls man ein paar euro übrig haben sollte---dann allerdings das four season buchen. unbeschreibliche lage --- nur 10 minuten vom dom in einem alten palast umgeben vom größten privaten stadtpark."
50,“Italy at its best”,"Eine traumhafte Stadt für einen Tapetenwechsel. Sie bietet viel Kultur, ein angenehmes Ambiente und eine herrliche Kulinarik.Meine Empfehlung - Vespa mieten um die Stadt zu erkunden und Richtung Piazzale Michelangelo zu düsen (Blick genießen und Rotweingläser nicht vergessen ;-)Ansonsten empfiehlt sich auch eine Segway Tour (lustig in kleinen Gruppen)Zum Besuchen eignet sich Frühling oder Herbst. Im Sommer eher zu meiden (viel los, sehr heiß)."
50,"“Mercato Centrale si San Lorenzo "" da non perdere""”","Quando si visita una città,è bello assaporarne le tradizioni ed i gusti legati a lei.Consiglio una bella visita al Merato Centrale di San Lorenzo in pieno centro cittadino dove possiamo fare vari acquisti gastronomici oppure fermarsi a degustare le specilità culinarie autoctone!Orario 7:00/ 14:00 aperto tutto l'anno dal Lunedì al Sabato compreso.Consiglio di sostare a mangiare un buon panino con frattaglie ( tipico FIORENTINO ) al banco di "" Nerbone"",e per acquistare prodotti tipici ed avere consigli su come visitare Firenze rivolgersi alla polleria TREVISAN, il Sig Carlo è un vero menestrello fiorentino!!"
50,“Meravigliosa Firenze”,"Data: maggio 2010Nelle prima settimana di maggio 2010 sono partita per Firenze assieme a degli amici.Firenze è una città a misura d' uomo (fatto stà che l abbiamo visitata a piedi) ma che possiede una cultura storica immensa.Mi ha lasciato senza fiato per una settimana intera,ho visto e sentito fra i musei,le cattedrali e nella città stessa un'Italia che è stata viva intellettualmente e spiritualmente e fiera di esserlo.Ero già stata in questa stupenda città,in gita,ma ero troppo piccola per vederla davvero,mi ha stupito piacevolmente.A chi sarà il prossimo a Visitarla,auguro un buon viaggio."
40,“firenze con familiarità”,"conosco firenze da sempre, ci ho anche vissuto per alcuni anni della mia vita, forse, proprio per questo, non riesco a farne a meno; non riesco a non tornare sui lungarni, a camminare davanti Palazzo Vecchio, a fare una passeggiata nel verde in pieno centro nel giardino di Boboli. Se volete risparmiare e vedere sereamente la città vivendo una sensazione di familiarità vi consiglio di connettervi al sito www.waytoflorence.com dove potrete scegliere, in base alla grandezza e alla disponibilità, un appartamento in pieno centro storico (le località sono piazza Duomo, Santa Croce, Piazza Signoria). L a cosa incredibile: ritrovarsi magari dietro la chiesa di Santa Croce e poter fare colazione in un giardino di cui non potevi sapere l'esistenza, così nel bel mezzo di quel piccolo salotto di storia che da una vita contnua ad affascinarmi! buon viaggio a tutti!"
50,“托斯卡纳艳阳下”,《托斯卡纳艳阳下》——其实，我是从佛罗伦萨回来后才看到的这部电影，虽然电影里没有给佛罗伦萨城区太多的篇幅，但是仍然唤起了我对那片大区的热烈而美好的回忆。佛罗伦萨是一个容易让人沉醉的城市。空气中弥漫着红酒的甜美气息，生活舒适安逸，太阳似乎照进了每个人的心里，再从脸上映出来，阳光明媚，笑容灿烂。这部电影值得一看，而佛罗伦萨，值得一去再去。
50,“Ein Tag in Florenz”,"Von Bologna aus fuhren wir mit der Bahn nach Florenz. Ein ausgedehnter Stadtbummel durch das Zentrum führte uns klarerweise zum Dom, der als der schönste von ganz Italien gilt, und anderen historisch anmutenden Bauwerken und Plätzen. Im Palazzo Vecchio sind Figuren des einmaligen Künstlers Michelangelo Buonarroti zu besichtigen jedoch nicht zu fotografieren, zum Beispiel David. Die Kopie der Statue vor dem Palast muss als Motiv genügen. Der Spaziergang führte weiter über die Ponte Vecchio. Für die Rückfahrt nach Bolgogna wählten wir einen Hochgeschwindigkeitszug, sodass die Fahrt nur 37 Minuten dauerte. Beim nächsten Mal ist ein längerer Aufenthalt in Florenz ohne Weiteres denkbar."
50,“seit 15 Jahren Toskana und immer wieder Florenz”,"Florenz ist einfach wunderschön. Sei es zum Verweilen in den Boboligärten oder auf Kultur in den Dom oder die Uffizien. Florenz bietet einfach unheimlich viel Abwechslung. Auch das Shoppen sollte man dabei nicht vergessen. Restaurants sucht man sich am besten nicht in der Nähe vom Dom, sondern besser in den etwas außerhalb liegenden Bezirken....günstiger und besser. Das Parken ist in Parkhäusern teilweis sehr teuer (bis zu 7 EUR/Std.). Man sollte lieber Ausschau halten nach Parkplätzen. Manche sind überwacht und kosten 2-3 EUR/Std."
50,“Eine der schönsten Städte der Toskana”,"Leider war ich nur zwei Tage in dieser wunderschönen Stadt - ich könnte mir gut vorstellen, hier eine Woche zu bleiben!Wunderschönes Stadtbild, atemberaubende Architektur, und gutes Essen - was will man mehr?Während meines Aufenthalts habe ich mich fast ausschließlich in der Altstadt bewegt; der Dom, die Ponte Vecchio, und das Rathaus haben mich sehr begeistert. Einen tollen Ausblick über die Stadt kann man von der Piazzale Michaelangelo erhaschen.Autoreisende sind gut beraten, ihr Fahrzeug nicht im Zentrum abzustellen - es gibt so gut wie keine kostenlosen Parkplätze, Garagen sind sehr teuer."
50,“Wunderschöne&Kunstvolle Stadt”,"Florenz ist für mich eine der schönsten Städte der Welt.Als ich dort ankam war ich sofort verzaubert von den gigantischen Bauwerken und dem luxeriösen Glanz den diese Stadt versprüht.Es gibt eine unendliche Breite an verschiedenen Museen und Kunswerken. Doch neben dem kulturellen Aspekt den Florenz zu bieten hat gibt es auch viele Geschäfte von Luxus-Marken die fast alle in alten aber sehr glamoreusen Gebäuden untergebracht sind. Wer nicht so viel Geld ausgeben möchte wird sicherlich etwas auf den wirklich sehenswerten Märkten finden.Alles in Allem kann man sagen, dass diese Stadt Kultur, Glanz und Luxus faszienierend in sich vereint. Einfach eine richtige schöne Stadt!"
50,“不可思议的紫粉色——宛如美女的城市”,佛罗伦萨不仅是艺术气息浓厚，她的天然之美也是摄人心魄的。从来没有见过可以与之相媲美的紫粉色的天与水，桥与楼，那种美远盛过她的教堂、她的雕塑、她的画廊……
50,“die wahrscheinlich schönste Stadt in der Toskana”,"Ich kann über Florenz eigentlich nur schwärmen! Wenn man Kulturliebhaber ist, kommt man um einen Besuch dieser hübschen Stadt im Herzen der Toskana nicht herum!Die Paläste, Kirchen und Plätze muß man einfach gesehen und besucht haben.Michaelangelo hat überall seine Handschrift hinterlassen.Am Stadtrand findet sich ein Sheraton Hotel, in dem man in gehobenem Standard günstig übernachten kann.Mit einer Stadtrundfahrt (rund 20 Euro) kann man sich einen ersten Überblick verschaffen und dann auf eigene Faust die schönen Bauwerke erkunden.In jedem Fall eine Reise wert !"
30,“Una ciudad muy bella con servicios excesivamente caros”,"En mi segunda visita a Florencia no quería que se me escapara nada, ya que en la enterior solo estuve un día de pasada y me quede encantado. En esta ocasión queria patearla a conciencia y no dejar de descubir ningun ricón en estos 10 días. Hay que reconocer que es una ciudad bellisima, llena de arte, y sitios estupendos, pero la verdad es que se han disparado con los precios demasiado, No me parece razonable el coste de museos, comidas, bebidas, etc. Creo que se aprovechan demasiado. Ademas no debes perder de vista la cuenta por que en mas de 5 ocasiones, demasiadas para ser casualidad, nos pretendian cobrar de mas, o cosas no pedidas, etc. Los carteles de los restaurantes son engañosos intencionadamente y salvo alguna excepción (que siempre las hay) cuando ves un menu por un precio, te encuentras con un solo plato, sin postre, al que hay que sumar bebidas (disparates), cubiertos e incluso en algún sitio 15% de servicio aparte. Creo que hacen un flaco favor al turismo."
50,“No dejes de ir a Florencia”,¿Qué decir de Florencia?Florencia es una de las ciudades más bonitas del mundo y una visita obligada al menos una vez en la vida.
40,“歩き回るだけでも十分”,いくつも見どころはあると思いますが、ただ町の中を散策するだけでも、十分風景を楽しめます。お勧めは川沿い。とても雰囲気がいいです。時間がある場合はやはりドゥオモをお勧めします。登るのは結構きついですが、一番上からの見晴らしの良い景色は最高です。天井の壁画もぜひ登って近くで見ていただきたいです。イタリアの中ではフィレンツェが一番気に入り、もう一度訪れたい場所です。
50,“der schönste Ort in der Toskana mit einem wunderschönen Dom”,"Die Innenstadt von Florenz ist autofrei!!!Anders wäre es wahrscheinlich auch nicht möglich die vielen Touristen durch die engen Gassen ziehen zu lassen, die den wunderschönen Dom besichtigen möchten, der etwas beengt zwischen den anliegenden Gebäuden steht, so dass seine Größe nicht richtig zum Ausdruck kommt.Florenz hat neben dem Dom Santa Maria del Fiore mit dem Campanile und dem Baptisterium aber noch andere sehenswerte kulturelle Attraktionen, z.B. dem Palazzo Vecchio mit seinem 94 m hohen Torre d'Arnolfo, die Skupturen unter den Arkaden der Loggia dei Lanzi, die Uffizien mit den Kunstsammlungen der Medici, die Brücke Ponte Vecchio sowie den Palazzo Pitti mit den anschließenden wunderschönen Boboli-Gärten.Florenz ist wirklich eine Reise wert!!!... und man gelang in 1 Std. Zugfahrt für ca. 6 Euro zum Schiefen Turm von Pisa."
50,“Immer wieder Wochenende”,"Florenz eignet sich im Sommer, wie im Winter immer wieder für einen 3-4 Tage Kurztrip. Meine Idealreise: Freitag aus Deutschland mit der Lufthansa für 170-300 EUR inkl. Umsteigen in FRA oder MUC nach Florenz anreisen. Montag Mittag zurück. Der Flughafen Firenze-Peretola liegt nur knapp 5 Km ausserhalb des Zentrums. Mit dem Linienbus zum Bahnhof Santa Maria Novella ist man für 5 EUR in 20 Minuten im Zentrum. Hier kann man auch gleich ein Mittelklasse Hotel für 50-70 EUR dazubuchen. Immer zentral, immer am Bahnhof. Die meisten Strecken kann man dann bequem laufen. Ein Taxi vom Duomo (Kathedrale von Florenz / Santa Maria del Fiore) zum Flughafen kostet ca. 17 EUR. Im Sommer sollte man bei der Hotelbuchung schon darauf achten, dass die Zimmer über einen Klimaanlage verfügen. Tags wird es locker bis 40 Grad heiss und nachts kühlt es nur wenig ab. nbedingt besuchen sollte man natürlich die Standards: Palazzo Pitti, Palazzo Vecchio und die Uffizien. Aber im Sommer gehört ein Besuch des Giardino di Boboli auf ejden Fall ins Programm. Im Sommer finden jed Menge Veranstaltungen hier statt: Das Opern-Festival in 2010 mit sehr professionellen Freiluftaufführungen, die bei 30 Grad und einbrechender Dunkelheit unvergleichlich sind."
10,“Banditi a Firenze!!!!”,"Siamo stati qualche giorno a Firenze. . . Lasciamo perdere i commenti alle varie attrazioni della Città famose nel mondo per cui vale la pena visitare. . .non ci sono parole per la loro bellezza, vorrei però criticare pesantemente l'ospitalità dei Fiorentini che si occupano di ristorazione e turismo l'unica parola che mi sembra appropriata e BANDITI!!! Prezzi folli,qualità da cinesi e professionalità inesistente. . . turisti rapinati legalmente in ogni situazione dal bar in centro all'hotel (Hotel??) ai vari ristoranti pizzeria che offrono un servizio davvero indecente sia per la cordialità zero, che per la qualità dei cibi. . . bellissima la città ma quanti BANDITI!!!!!"
40,“Die Perle der Toskana”,"Florenz ist mit Sicherheit eine der schoensten Staedte Italiens. Der Stadtkern ist ein offenes Museum, jede Gasse erzaehlt von mehr als 700 Jahren Geschichte. Man spuert die Toskana, man sieht die Huegel am Stadtrand. In weniger als 10 Minuten ist man mitten in der bezaubernden Toskana zwischen Olivenbaeumen und Zypressen. Die aelteste Kirche der Stadt liegt ueberhalb dem Piazzale Michelangelo: San Miniato! Von dort hat man einen traumhaften Ausblick ueber die ganze Stadt und im Mittelpunkt der Dom mit der Kuppel von Brunelleschi. Florenz ist eine Reise wert, nicht im Sommer, denn es ist zu heiss. Die beste Reisezeit ist der Fruehling oder der Herbst, wenn die Weinlese beginnt."
50,“la culla dell'arte”,"...una città a misura d'uomo...ricca di arte, pittoresca e romantica...stupenda!!!"
30,“Florenz”,"Florenz ist eine sehr schöne in Italien gelegen Stadt. da sie in der Toskana gelegen ist ist es zu empfelen,dass sie Florenz im Herbst besuchen. Florenz bietet viel geschichte und atem beraubende altbauden. Die altstadt ist sehr schön und bietet viele möglichkeiten gut und günstig zu essen. Florenz hat viele sehenswürdigkeiten und Musseen. Auch für die Damen ist Florenz interessant da es in der Umgebung viele Outlets gibt und man preishaft einkaufen kann."
50,“Florencia tiene una luz especial”,"Florencia es uno de esos lugares mágicos que merece la pena visitar. A mí nunca me había llamado la atención la Toscana, pero me he enamorado de tal modo de esa tierra que algún día volveré.Lo primero que disfruté de Florencia fue la luz, esa luz distinta que tiene al atardecer que la hace única en el mundo. Parece que hasta el color del cielo, del agua del Arno y de las casas sea distinto a cualquier otro lugar.Siempre he oído que el corazón de Florencia es el Duomo, pero a mí me pareció que era su río, el Arno. Si vais a Florencia no os olvidéis de ir al atardecer para ver como se pone el sol y seguro que os gustará también pasear por el río por la noche. Si os gusta la fotografía lo disfrutaréis especialmente.El Ponte Vecchio, el más famoso de sus puentes me encantó. Todos los turistas se dedican a sacarle fotos y curiosear en las joyerías que hay en él.La Piazza della Signora (Plaza de la Señoría) es donde se encuentra el Palazzo Vechio (Palacio Viejo) construido entre 1299 y 1314 por el arquitecto Arnolfo di Cambio. Es ante su puerta donde encontraréis una copia del David de Miguel Ángel en el lugar donde estaba el original y Hércules y Caco de Bacico Bandinelli a su lado. Es también la Piazza della Signora donde está la fuente de Neptuno. También hay allí otras estatuas importantes como Perseo que levanta la cabeza de Medusa.No os podéis perder tampoco el Duomo de Florencia, la catedral de Santa Maria del Fiore, famosa por su cúpula de Brunelleschi.Arnolfo di Cambio diseñó la nueva catedral en 1296 con la idea de que su grandeza mostrara la grandeza que estaba adquiriendo la ciudad. La construcción de la catedral duró mucho años y después de la muerte del arquitecto, otros continuaron su obra pero nadie podía hacer una cúpula de esas dimensiones que fuera esférica. Fue Fillippo Brunelleschi quien diseñó una cúpula de forma muy ingeniosa y fue la cúpula más grande del mundo en la época.Frente al Duomo se encuentra el Baptisterio. Aseguraos de observar las puertas doradas apodadas Las puertas del Paraíso. También podéis subir al Campanile del Duomo y disfrutar de la vista de la ciudad que os ofrece.Si queréis visitar la galería de los Uffizzi os recomiendo que vayáis con antelación a comprar las entradas o que las compréis por internet. De un modo o de otro, al comprar las entradas os dan fecha y hora para visitar la galería. Si no habéis podido comprar las entradas por internet, dirigíos a la puerta 1 de las numerosas puertas de acceso que hay a la galería. Allí podéis comprar las entradas para al cabo de unas horas y ahorraros la cola de aquellos que quieren entrar inmediatamente.En la galería de los Uffizzi podréis disfrutar de las obras de Botticcelli, o la Venus de Urbino de Tiziano.Después de recomendar las atracciones turísticas más importantes de la ciudad, debo decir también la parte negativa de la Florencia turística. Y es eso precísamente, el turismo masivo que inunda Florencia en cualquier época del año. Todo el centro está lleno de multitudes de turistas, siempre en medio de la calle escuchando al guía. Esta cantidad increíble de turistas hace que todo el centro esté dedicado únicamente a ellos y uno deba alejarse mucho del centro para verse rodeado de italianos y sus vidas. Con esto quiero decir que todo lo que encontraréis para comer o comprar cualquier cosa será caro y de poca calidad a menos que esteis dispuestos a ir a comer a las afueras. No pude disfrutar tanto de la comida italiana tanto como lo había hecho en Milán y en Roma, donde encontré restaurantes con un precio decente en los que cocinaban bien. En el centro de Florencia solo encontré bares donde vendían bocadillos fríos y caros, pizzas recalentadas y helados carísimos que en nada se diferenciaban a los que comemos en España (salvo por el precio).Incluso en una heladería nos cobraron 7€ por el helado más pequeño (no dejaban coger nada más pequeño, aunque éste era bastante grande) pero nos lo dieron con la galleta rota y se iba cayendo. Tampoco nos lo quisieron cambiar.Como en cualquier otro lugar, si hay una zona de la ciudad donde solo hay turistas, se aprovechan de ellos para exprimirles el dinero. Ese es para mí, la parte negativa de Florencia."
50,“Restaurant fabuleux à Florence”,"La cuisine est excellente, le service est rapide, et la serveuse ainsi que l'ambiance très sympa !!Je suis réellement satisfaite tant au niveau du service, de la convivialité, de la localisation que du parking gratuit, sans parler du choix des menus !!."
50,“綺麗な町です”,イタリアで行ってみる価値のある町です。ルネッサンス時代のお金に糸目をつけないで建てられた建物は見ものです。食べ物も個性的で肉料理はとても美味でした。お勧めです。
50,“Florenz - das Beste an Italien”,"Florenz - Hier kommt alles Kultivierte zusammen.Lebensstil, Kultur, Historisches, Genuss"
30,“「美」の街とはいうけれど・・・”,貴重な美術品が多く集まっているだけでなく、美食の街、なんて言われますね。確かに美術的には必見物ばかりで、ウフィッツィなどは本気で隅から隅まで観ようと思えば１週間以上かかりそうですよね。（それにしても、予約制が出来たのですね！１０年ほど前に一度行きましたが、その頃は・・・）ただ、食事については、特段他の都市と比べて「美味しい」というほどでもない気がしました。まあ、美味しいんですけどね。ゆっくり美術を堪能するにはいい街だと思います。時間をかけて、滞在できるのであれば。美術にそこまで興味がなかったり、時間がないのであれば、それこそ必見スポットなどをぱっと見て余裕があれば大聖堂の上から街を展望。それくらいで十分かも知れません。
50,“フィレンツェ＆ピサ（２泊３日）”,2009年7月5日～7日にフィレンツェに滞在しました（２泊３日）フィレンツェで是非とも行って欲しいのが、「ミケランジェロ広場」！ここからのフィレンツェの眺めは最高です！あまり映りはよくないですが、写真をＵＰしておきます！ここにはバス又はタクシーで行くことができます！あと、食べて欲しいのがジェラート！特に「Ｇｅｌａｔｅｒｉａ　Ｃａｒａｂｅ（カラベ）」って店は、シチリア風ジェラートで、暑い時には、レモンが最高に美味しい！フィレンツェからちょっと足を伸ばすと「ピサ」に行けます！ピサといえば、「ピサの斜塔」！これは、絶対に登ったほうがいいです！チケットは予約制（人数制限あり）で、日本でも予約できます！これも写真をＵＰしてますので、のぞいていってください！
50,“Piazzale Michelangelo: imperdibile.”,"Piazzale MichelangeloUna terrazza con una vista fantastica su Firenze: si dominano il Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, l'Arno... e sulla terrazza domina una copia del David di Michelangelo. Un luogo rilassante, appagante e romantico, unico al mondo."
50,“不只是艺术”,常说学艺术怎能不来一次佛罗伦萨！但实际上除了艺术，佛罗伦萨还有更多惊喜等你发现。。。在物价普遍偏高的欧洲，这里也许是性价比最高的城市了。你可以看到古迹、名胜，可以领略托斯卡纳迷人的风情，可以逛各种市集、名店，更可以尝到物美价廉的美味。绝对不容错过！！
50,“La ciudad mas bella del mundo”,"No se puede describir lo que se siente al pasear , simplemente, por Florencia ninguna ciudad por monumental e historica atrapa al viajero como esta.Toda es un monumento con un estilo que atrapa y emociona,querria volver..."
50,“florence ville d'art par excellence”,"j'ai séjourné une semaine à florence avec mon mari au mois de mars. Nous avons été émerveillé par cette magnifique ville, qui recèle de trésors à tous les coins de rue en plus des sites mondialement connus.Poussez la porte cochère d'un palais et vous aurez la surprise de trouver une belle cour avec des statues, des fontaines.Promenez vous dans les petites rues des quartiers pas touristiques où le vrai florence vit comme le quartier san ambrogio, santa croze, san lorenzo.Dégustez de bonne glaces au Procopio (via pietrapana).Laissez vous embarquer par cette somptueuse ville où il fait bon vivre.Faites le marché où vous serez comblés par la beauté des étals de fruits et légumes et des charcuteries.Sinon rentrez dans une enoteca pour déguster un verre de chianti à l'heure de l'apéritivo, entre amis .Promenez vous sur les bords de l'arno au coucher de soleil, romantisme assuré.Visitez le plus anciens musée du monde la galerie des offices où vous pourrez admirer les plus grands chef d'oeuvre deBOTICELLI, DE VINCI, MICHEL ANGE et tant d'autres.Sans oublier de visiter le duomo cette magnifique cathédraleAttardez vous sur la place de la signoria ou vous trouverez la copie de DAVID et pleins d'autres sculptures devant le palazio vecchio.Emprunter le ponte vecchio ou vous trouverez toutes les bijouteries.Sans oublier de caresser le groin du sanglier au mercato novocela porte bonheur.et plein d'autres découvertes et visites à faire au gré de vos envies."
50,“サンタ・マリア・ノヴェッラ教会”,最初の教会は10世紀にはあったが、拡大のため1279年再建着工。14世紀に完成。ゴシック様式ながらフィレンツェ独自のスタイルを確立。1458年から1470年にかけて、アルベルティがファサードを改築。現在の白、緑、ピンクの大理石を使った美しい幾何学模様となった。ここもファサード向かって左手が中庭を持つ回廊になっており、そこがサンタ・マリア・ノヴェッラ教会美術館になっている。回廊の壁一面に描かれたウッチェッロのフレスコ画は、殆ど剥落、退色していて見るに耐えない。左奥に入口があり、一番奥の大部屋に壁一面にアレッサンドロ・アッローリの大フレスコ画「マナの饗宴」がある。その隣の部屋にはアッローリのキャンバス画「最後の晩餐」あり。左右が半円形にはみ出しており、珍しい構図。「スペイン人の大礼拝堂」と呼ばれる大部屋に、アンドレ・ダ・フィレンツェが描いた全壁面を覆いつくす大壁画、｢キリストと殉教者ペテロの生涯｣、｢聖トマスの勝利｣、｢ドメニコ会派修道士の勝利｣がある。教会に入るには別に2.5ユーロ必要。美術館の方はフラッシュを焚かなければ撮影可だが、教会は全面禁止。この教会は真に美術館。ドメニコ・ギルランダイオ「聖母マリアの生涯」、「洗礼者ヨハネの生涯」、ジョットの「キリスト磔刑像」、マザッチョの「三位一体」、ボッティチェリ「イエスの誕生」、ダヴィデ・ギルランダイオ「聖ルキア」、ピエトロ・ミニアートのフレスコ画「受胎告知」、ポントルモ「聖女ヴェロニカ」、フィリピーノ・リッピ｢聖ピリポと聖ヨハネの生涯｣、ネーリ・ディ・ビッチ板絵「受胎告知」等がズラリと揃う。
50,“有很多美好的小巷、一条金光闪闪的河流，无数天堂般的感受”,佛罗伦萨的每个时辰都是美妙的。广场的艺术家、小巷里的美食、好喝的酒、夜晚的灯光和月光，加上某部电影的音乐伴随，令我多次在佛罗伦萨的街巷里不想回家。How far can you fly?
50,“La dolce vita!”,"Un mélange fantastique d'art, d'histoire, de culture, de gastronomie et de ruelles charmantes... Laissez vous séduire."
50,“芸術よりお肉？”,ローマ、フィレンツェ、ベネチアと回りましたが、この3都市のなかでは一番落ち着いた街でした。とはいえ、メディチ家蔵コレクション、ウフィツィ美術館は外せません。朝早く行っても相当並びますが、これは覚悟の上で。中には入るとそれほど混雑もなく、ボッティチェッリのビーナスの誕生などたくさんの有名作品を見ることが出来ます。川沿いの道を歩くだけで古く穏やかな空気を感じることが出来、お散歩にもお勧め。街中は広場、小道と多少入り組んでいますが、点在するリストランテでは是非トスカーナ郷土料理のTボーンステーキをどうぞ。キロで頼みますが、家族4人で1キロ、ぺろりと食べてしまいました。お値段はそれなりに張りますけど、ここまできたならやっぱりこのお肉でしょう。イタリアンブランドの買い物もローマほどの混雑がなく、ゆっくり見れると思います。
50,“絵になる景色”,フィレンツェの町はドゥオモの他、観光名所はこじんまりとまとまっています。歩いて回ることができる為、色んな景色を堪能しながらのんびり町歩きをするのは楽しいです。
50,“Una giornata Fantastica sotto il sole dalle toscana”,"Io e mio marito ci siamo concessi il 'lusso' di una giornata in giro per il Chianti scortati e coccolati.Nel sito questo pacchetto è indicato con il nome ""A Taste of Chianti.."".Siamo stati trattati con professionalità e cortesia, abbiamo visitato le colline del chianti e ci siamo fermati a degustare vino in una splendida cantina.Nel complesso abbiamo passato una giornata veramente piacevole ed abbiamo imparato molto sul Chianti (quello vero!) in compagnia di un accompagnatore preparato e competente."
50,“Una maravillosa ciudad italiana Florencia”,"Florencia es un lugar magico tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo en el verano de 2009, fui a finales de agosto la ciudad es hermosa llena de cultura y es super romantica, como la mayoria de los lugares en europa. Para comer les recomiendo la especialidad de la casa el filete a la florentina. El domo es impresionante y vale la pena subir para que vean a la hermosa florencia a sus pies, lugar excepcional para tomar muchisimas fotos. Si van a Italia es lugar obligado conocer florencia. En cuanto a la estadía yo llegue en tren desde Milano y agarre un taxi que me llevo a los alrededores de la estación central la cual esta llena de hoteles. Les adjunto algunas fotos buena suerte y buen viaje!!!"
50,“ルネッサンス発祥地”,多くの芸術家を輩出し、今も芸術的な建築物が多く歴史の芸術遺産を残す街並みは｢屋根のない博物館｣と言われるのも納得です。ルネッサンス時代にタイムスリップしたような錯覚を楽しみました。
50,“豊かな気分になれる街”,大学の卒業旅行でバックパックの自由旅行で訪れました。2月という寒い時期でしたが、川沿いの張り詰めた空気の冷たさが、オレンジ色の屋根の街並みを一層際立たせていた感じです。高台から見たフィレンツェ市内の風景は絶景です。3日程の滞在でしたが、毎日通って眺めました。安い旅行でしたが、何をとってもおいしく楽しい街です。美術館もすばらしく、有名なドゥオーモののある広場ももちろん素敵です。石畳の街を歩いているだけで、豊かな気分になれました。
40,“ルネッサンスのフィレンツェへ”,個人旅行でイタリアへ２週間行ってきました。フィレンツェへはローマからユーロスターで約２時間。ドゥオーモ、洗礼堂、礼拝堂、美術館などどれも最高の思い出になりました。半地下のトラットリア”ブーカマリオ”などで名物のステーキを食べ、フィレンツェを満喫できました。それほど大きな街ではないので、１～２日で回れます。今（2009年10月）は円高でヨーロッパに行きやすいので思い切っていってみてはどうでしょうか。
50,“素敵なところ☆最高です♪”,フィレンツェの街が文化財です。歴史地区です。塔に登って町を見渡すと、それはもう絶景です。ウフィッツィ美術館は、前の記事にも書きましたが、ルネッサンスの傑作が集まって、全部を見るのに時間が全く足りないほど。高い天井にも描かれ、首が痛くなるほど。とにかく見ごたえあり。ヴェッキオ橋も眺められ、アルノ川から流れてくる風が心地よく居心地がよいです。橋の上には金細工のショップがずらりとならんでいます。何と言っても、サンタ・マリア・デル・フィオーレ大聖堂は圧巻！とてつもなく大きく、歓声があがるほど。となりのジョットの鐘楼に登れば、ドォーモを眺めることができるのです。歴史深い町です。イタリアにいったらぜひ行ってください。素晴らしい街並みに感動するでしょう。お土産屋さんも　町のあちこちにあります。革細工も有名です。ｵﾘｼﾞﾅﾙレザー（ジャケットなど）も、宿泊してるホテルまで届けてくれるお店もあります。
50,“Finalmente Piazza Duomo interamente pedonale!”,"Finalmente uno dei luoghi più belli, monumentali ed affascinanti del mondo, parte del sito Patrimonio dell'Umanità costituito dal Centro Storico di Firenze, sarà restituito alla piena godibilità di tutti! Da domenica 25 ottobre 2009, infatti, l'intera area costituita da Piazza del Duomo e dall'adiacente Piazza San Giovanni (dove si trova l'omonimo splendido Battistero) sarà interamente pedonalizzata, assieme alle vie immediatamente adiacenti.Fino ad oggi, oltre 2.000 autobus al giorno, più veicoli privati e taxi, attravensavano la parte nord delle due piazze, tanto che il complesso monumentale costituito dal Battistero di San Giovanni, dalla Cattedrale di Santa di Maria del Fiore e dal Campanile di Giotto, erano stati definiti ""il più elegante spartitraffico del mondo""!Finalmente arriva il provvedimento atteso da decenni, che renderà l'intera area un altro splendido ""salotto buono"" della Città di Firenze, come già lo erano altri luoghi meravigliosi, da Piazza della Signoria a Piazza Santa Croce.E' un fatto significativo, che preserverà il sito UNESCO dalle vibrazioni e dallo smog provocati dal pesante traffico, oltre a restituire questo luogo fantastico alla piena godibilità dei cittadini e dei visitatori di tutto il mondo! L'evento sarà salutato con aperture straordinarie del complesso della Cattedrale e di Palazzo Vecchio, oltre ad un concerto dell'orchestra del celebre Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Un notizia di cui essere felici per tutti gli amanti dell'arte, della storia, della cultura e della bellezza."
50,“世界遺産フィレンツェ”,元添乗員です。イタリアはあまり好きじゃないという方もいらっしゃいますが、イタリアはやっぱりサイコーです！特に私の好きな場所はフィレンツェ。フィレンツェは京都と姉妹都市。何処となくホッとする感じです。料理も買い物もフィレンツェが一番です！トリッパやトスカーナステーキ、ワインも美味しい！一番好きなのはジョットの鐘楼！階段で上まで行くと、フィレンツェの町が一望できます。ドォウモより鐘楼をおススメします。
50,“Under the Tuscan Sun Tours”,"Sono tornato a Firenze per lavoro ed ho deciso di passare una giornata 'guidato' da Andrea.E' stata un'esperienza veramente coinvolgente.Andrea conosce l'arte e la città di Firenze, ti rende partecipe del suo sapere riuscendo sempre ad essere interessante.Girare da soli per Firenze è bellissimo ma con una guida esperta è sicuramente più interessante.Lo consiglio veramente a tutti."
40,“革製品購入するなら”,移動のユーロスターで知り合ったアメリカ人の旅行者の方から聞きました。イタリアで革製品を購入するなら、フィレンツェが安いと。確かに最初の滞在地ベニスと比べると１割は確実に安いです。ラム革の手袋を購入しましたが、値切ることも可能でした。
10,“Teuer und unfreundlich”,"Mir hat Florenz überhaupt nicht gefallen! Das Essen und die Getränke waren völlig überteuert, zudem war der Service durchgehend sehr verbesserungswürdig. Die Stadt selbst erschien mir sehr abweisend -überall geschossene Fensterläden, die Einheimischen waren auch nicht gerade freundlich, als wir nach dem Weg fragten. Für mich muß Florenz nicht mehr sein, zumal die dortige ""Kunst"" auch sehr Geschmacksache ist. Ich war froh, als der Tagesausflug zu Ende war."
50,“一度行ってみたかったフィレンツェ”,フィレンツェにずっと行きたいと、高校生のころから思っており、やっと実現しました。ドゥオーモやクーポラがすごく良かったです。感動しました。建物にも統一感があり、町並みもすごく感動的でした。また行きたいなぁと思いました。
40,“Atardecer inolvidable”,"Atardeceres increibles para ir con tu pareja y sentarte en la ""Piazza Miguel Angel"" a disfrutarlo así como si te gusta el arte, está la galería Ufizzi (Caravaggio, Miguel Angel, Botticelli, etc) y también merece la pena alquilar un coche y visitar algunas ciudades como San Gimigniano o Siena a la vez que disfrutas de un paseo por la Toscana."
50,“フィレンツェの町は歩きで”,フィレンツェの町の中心地は歩いて回れるぐらいの所に観光名所が集まっており、歩いて回ることをお勧めします。細い路地なども雰囲気がよく、小さなお店があったりと楽しいです。ただ、あまり人気のない路地などは危険かもしれません。実際にスリらしき人や後ろからつけてくる人もおり、あきらかに狙われている事がありました。そういう場合は、すぐに大通りなどに出た方がいいです。観光地なのでスリなども多いので鞄は常に自分の前に来るようにたすきがけにしたりと、対策はした方がいいです。しかし、フィレンツェの町は世界遺産だけに本当に素晴らしいので、ぜひ安全に配慮して町中を歩いて回って欲しいです。
50,“時間が止まったような感覚”,「街中が美術館」まさにその言葉通りの町なのです。どこを見ても、趣があり、そしてそれを大切に守ってきたことが伝わってくるのです。日本人が見習わなければならない心だと切に思いました。フィレンツェの町を一望したいなら、ドゥオモのクーポラに上るの一番です。赤レンガ調の街並みを見ていると、時間がたつのを忘れてしまうので注意ですよ(^^ゞ夕暮れ時に訪れたいのは「ミケランジェロ広場」。夕焼けにそまって輝く光景は本当に素敵です。カフェもあるので、そこからしばらく眺めるのもいいでしょう。ただ、最近は治安が悪いようなので女性は注意しましょう。
50,“古都”,旅行中、ローマステイでフィレンツェまで日帰りで足を伸ばしました。あんなに小さな町だとは思っておらず、バスやタクシーであちこち動く予定でいたのですが、すっかり丸一日歩いて移動しました。町中の雰囲気はさすははフィレンツェ、ムード満点。何とも言えない古都の雰囲気がとてもすばらしかったです。何度も映画の舞台に使われているので目にしたことのある町だと思いますが、映画からは伝わってこないアットホームな雰囲気がとてもよかったです。レストランやお店の方たちもとてもフレンドリーで、観光客慣れしているので、とても居心地のよい町でした。
50,“町並みがかわいい”,フィレンツェは、なんと言っても町並みが可愛らしく、統一された色合いで、見ていると心落ち着きます。写真は、ミケランジェロの丘からの景色です。また、ウフィッツイ美術館は必見です。ミケランジェロや、ボッティチェリなど、有名画家の絵が堪能できます。そのほか、「冷静と情熱のあいだに」のロケでも使用されたドゥオモがあります。登って見るのも良いかも知れません。
30,“Dem Florenzhype kann ich jetzt nicht folgen...”,"Von Florenz wird ja immer sehr geschwärmt. Klar, es ist kunsthistorisch gesehen sehr wertvoll und interessant, aber ansonsten.. ich finde, dass die übermäßig vielen Bau- und Kunstwerke alles kaputt machen, da einfach an jeder Ecke etwas steht und die restlichen Häuser und Anlagen sind nicht sonderlich toll."
40,“Ristorante Pizzeria Rubaconte”,"Per chi si dovesse trovare nei pressi di Firenze consiglio il Ristorante Rubaconte, è un posto tranquillo per cenare e rilassarsi.Il servizio è ottimo anche se, dal mio punto di vista, un pò lento;locale pulito ed il personale gentile.Unica pecca:anche se loro scrivono su internet che fanno il 10% di sconto per chi prenota via internet, non lo applicano mai."
50,“Una scelta davvero sorprendente!!”,"Siamo stati nel Mugello a fare una girata fuori porta,e verso l'ora del pranzo abbiamo visto queste indicazioni sulla provinciale tra Borgo San Lorenzo e Vicchio che indicavano ""Ristorante La Casa di Caccia"",ci siamo detti andiamo a vedere dove portano, dopo circa 10 Km siamo arrivati in questo posto, e la sorpresa è stata strepitosa; sia per la cucina,veramente buona ma soprattutto per la vista che guarda l'intera valle del mugello.Davvero una bella esperianza,c'erano tante persone noi siamo andati di Sabato,tuttavia abbiamo avuto il tavolo (noi non avevamo la prenotazione) e il personale è stato disponibile e veloce.ci ritorneremo di sicuro."
20,“perchè mi avete rimosso la recensione?”,"Perchè avete rimosso la mia recensione sul ristorante ""la beppa fioraia"" di Firenze?.grazie"
50,“Delizioso soggiorno michelangelo”,"Abbiamo soggiornato per 3 notti a maggio 1-2-3 al soggiorno michelangelo e dobbiamo dire che è stato molto confortevole e tranquillo a pochi passi dal centro,l'ospitalità e la disponibilità è stata altrettanto meravigliosa .Le camere sono ariose e ben pulite e dotate di tutti i confort.Vi consigliamo sicuramente il soggiorno michelangelo ottimi prezzi e ottimo soggiorno"
40,“Una ciudad con encanto”,"El centro de la ciudad es un lugar muy atractivo, medieval, peatonal.. para pasear mucho y donde hay mucho que ver, pagando y sin pagar,porque por cualquier rincón te encuentras con mucho arte y mucha gente, claro!en el verano debe ser muy caluroso pero en primavera ha estado muy agradablecuriosa la maqueta del centro de la ciudad para ciegos, está en la plaza de la república"
40,“綺麗な街です”,フィレンツェは街自体がとてもおしゃれで、道を歩くだけで楽しい気分になります。カフェ・お店・レストランも綺麗なところが多く、大変お勧めします。
20,“überlaufen”,"Früher, und das ist garnicht mal solange her, war Florenz eine elegante Stadt mit italienischem Flair. Leider verändert sich Florenz, ähnlich Venedig, durch den immer größer werdenden Tourismus nicht gerade zu ihrem Vorteil. Da gibt es zahlreiche Gruppern Jugendlicher und Schulklassen, in den engen Gassen wird es schwierig auszuweichen, die Treppen vor dem Dom werden belagert - zurück bleiben Getränkedosen, Plastikflaschen ec. Zu dem allgemeinen Gedränge kommen Bettler und illegale Straßenverkäufer aus Afrika und Asien, die Ihre Ware auf dem Boden ausbreiten. Man sollte wissen, dass man für den Erwerb gefälschter Ware bis zu 3000 EUR Strafe bezahlen muss! Vorsicht vor Taschendieben! (auch in den Linienbussen)Lange Warteschlangen vor den Eingängen von Dom, Kuppel oder Uffizien (2 Std. Wartezeit - am Besten man stellt sich mindestens eine halbe Stunde vor Kassaöffnung an). Relativ neu ist auch, dass für die Besichtigung von Kirchen Eintrit verlangt wird ( Santa Croce zB. EUR 7); sogar für den Eintritt zum Boboli Garten bezaht man 12 EUR und wird, ähnlich wie am Flughafen, kontrolliert - ich musste sogar bei eher kühlem Wetter meine Jacke auf das Band legen, im Freien versteht sich.Empfehlenswert ist auf jeden Fall ein Hotelzimmer zu einem Innenhof; auch bei geschlossenem Fenster wird man in der Innenstadt bis in die Morgenstunden von grölenden, singenden Passanten geweckt oder auch von vorbeifahrenden Autos mit lauter Musik... nicht nur an Wochenenden.Ich kenne Florenz seit über 20 Jahren, war privat oder beruflich an die 50mal da. Mein letzter Besuch - 2 Wochen im April 2009 - hat mich traurig gestimmt. Die Stadt hat viel von ihrem Flair und ihrer Romantik eingebüßt. Schade."
50,“イタリアの花の街。”,ずーーっと憧れていたフィレンツェ。あの有名なドゥオモからの景色が見たくて。一生忘れられない景色になりました。ウフィツィ美術館も、一日では足りません。ボッティチェリの絵を見られたことも感激でした。あとミケランジェロ広場からの眺望が有名ですが、広場から更に上に登っていったところにある教会からの景色がもっと良いとのこと。両方から見ましたが、確かに！！でした。ミケランジェロ広場にはたくさんの観光客が来ていましたがここの教会は人がちらほらいるくらい・・得したなぁ～と嬉しかったです。
40,“世界遺産の街”,街全体の色調が揃っていて、とても美しい街です世界遺産になっているだけありましたあちこちに美術館があり歴史を感じます街を歩いているだけでも楽しめます
50,“街が芸術”,憧れのドゥオモに感動でした！ドゥオモの中も、頂上から見る街並みもとても素晴らしかったです。美術館も、お店や全ての建物が私には芸術品でした！！この景色は他では味わえません。フィレンツェ大好きです☆
50,“ミケランジェロ広場は朝か夕方がお勧め”,フィレンツェの街を一望できる小高い丘にある広場です。フィレンツェは高い建物がないので街を一望するならここがよいです。サンタマリアノベッラ駅からバス12番か13番で行けます。バスの車窓もまた楽しいです。朝か夕方が陽の光を浴びて綺麗です。
50,“どこをとっても最高です！！”,町が世界遺産なだけあって、どこをとってもステキな町です。ドゥオモに行ってクーポラへ登って上から見る景色もステキです。お隣の鐘楼に登るとドゥオモも風景として見られるのでこちらを登るのもオススメします。ただし、どちらに登るにしても階段しかなかったと思います。。。体力温存してから登って下さい。ポンテベッキオは歩くのは楽しいですが、歩いていると橋自体がみれないので、お隣の橋まで行ってポンテベッキオを見てのもいいです。夕方頃からミケランジェロの丘に行って、フィレンツェの夕景を眺めると本当にキレイで感動します。ミケランジェロの丘へは駅前、といっても駅のロータリーではなく、マクドナルド方面へ信号渡ってすぐの所にある停留所からバスが出ています。ロータリーの券売所でチケットが買えない場合は、駅中のタバッキで購入して下さい。
40,“フラットでの生活”,２週間、フラットを借りてフィレンツェにいました。ホテルと違って気ままに暮らすように滞在できたのが良かったです。アルノ川のほとりにあるフラットだったのですが、夜のポンテヴェッキオを少し離れた橋から見るととてもキレイ！水面に光が写って幻想的な風景でした。初めてのヨーロッパで、建物や美術にもとても感動しました。とても広くて大変ですが、ウフィッツィ美術館はぜひ行くことをオススメします。
50,“日曜日に訪れました”,今回ドゥオモに昇るのが目的でツアーに参加しました。ところが、なんと日曜日はお休みで昇れないとの事。ツアー3日目の夜に知りました。翌日、日曜日のフィレンツェはデパートは営業してるものの、ブランド店や雑貨店など定休日のところがとても多かったです。ドゥオモからの景色は見れませんでしたが、お隣のジョットの鐘楼に昇りドゥオモを入れた風景をカメラに収める事ができ満足しました。楽しみにしていたウフィッツィ美術館も訪れ、芸術に疎い自分でも生の作品を近距離で鑑賞でき、感動しました。その他、市内を一望できるミケランジェロ広場などを訪れました。思っていた以上に素敵な都市でした。
50,“rinascimento”,... rinascimento ..... storia.........la piu bella citta del mondo
50,“Fusion - Un brunch sopraffino”,"Sono stata due settimane fa a mangiare al Fusion, ristorante dell'Hotel Gallery a Firenze. Un brunch delizioso, pietanze calde e fredde tutte ottime ed un sushi da 10 e lode. Che dire poi dei dolci!Il personale riesce a metterti a proprio agio ed offre un servizio impeccabile.L'ambiente di design è piacevole e rilassante ed una volta fuori si è a due passi dal Ponte Vecchio.Lo consiglio per una domenica alternativa, non rimarrete delusi!"
50,“ジョットの鐘楼”,イタリア旅行に弾丸ツアーで行ってきたのですが、回った町の中でフィレンツェが一番お気に入りの街となりました。街自体は数時間で回れてしまう程度の広さなのですが、あの空間はどれだけいても飽きることなく、再度訪れたいと思う街です。建物はこれぞイタリアでしょう!!!!っと思っていた姿を見ることができ、また道も広かったので歩きやすかったです。また、メディチ家について事前知識を得ていけば歴史についてももっと深い理解が出来ただろうと思うので行く前にはちょっと目を通しておくことをお勧めします。そして、フィレンツェといえば大聖堂です！これは落書きがあったことでも有名になったと思います。この大聖堂ドゥオモに登れるんですが、その横にある鐘楼にも登れます。時間や予算からどっちかというなら自分はこっちに登ることをおすすめします。大聖堂のクーポラを目の前に街全体を一望できたこの感動は本当にすばらしい!!!是非機会があれば訪れるべきと思います。
50,“街並みがいい感じ”,橋を見る風景がとてもキレイ。フィレンツェの街は入り組んでいてわかりづらいところはあるけれど。いろんな店があり、歩く度に発見があり、どこを歩いていても楽しい。飽きさせない街だと思います。
40,“美術館”,美術館はとても広く一日では回れないと思います　有名コレクションが展示してあって美術に興味のある人にはとてもいいところだと思います
50,“イタリアで一番のお気に入り♪”,2008年6月　7泊８日のイタリア旅行に行きました。　フィレンツェはイタリアの中でも最高ですね♪　街中は小綺麗で、可愛い日用品雑貨を売っているお店もいっぱいありました。　路地を抜けた先に現れたドゥオモの姿に圧倒され、１2時間もかけて飛行機に乗ってきた甲斐があったと大感動でした。　ドゥオモ建物内部にも入ることができます。　中は厳かな雰囲気に包まれていてステンドグラスから差す淡い光と灯された蠟燭の灯りでそれは荘厳な景色でした。　残念ながらジョットの鐘楼には登れませんでしたがまた来ることができたら必ず上がってフィレンツェの街並を見たいと思っています。ウフッツィ美術館で観たボッティチェリの『ヴィーナスの誕生』と『春』、そしてティツィアーノの『ウルビーノのヴィーナス』。　感動の時間は過ぎていきます。　ウルビーノのヴィーナスは今年日本で展覧会が催され上野の西洋美術館で観ることができたのですが、また観ることが、それもイタリアで観ることができるなんて何という幸せでしょうか♪私が行ったときはちょうどユーロカップが開催されていたのでそれに合わせて行われたのかシニョーリア広場でパレードに出会いました。　偶然にも中世の雰囲気溢れる楽しいパレードを見ることができてとてもラッキーでした。　さらに足を延ばしてサンタ･マリア･ノベッラ教会まで行き、お買い物を楽しみました。　以前から行きたかったフィレンツェですができたらもう一度ゆっくりとフィレンツェを楽しめる旅に行きたいと心から思いました。
50,“ミケランジェロ広場からのパノラマ！”,フィレンツェの街から東南部、アルノ川沿いから小高い丘を登るとあるミケランジェロ広場。ここからはフィレンツェを展望することができ、フィレンツェ独特のバラ色の街並みとドゥオモ、時計台などが見える最高のスポット。地元や観光客も足蹴なく通っている雰囲気も好き。
50,“toccata e fuga”,"Per passare una giornata diversa dal solito consiglio vivamente una gita a Firenze! so benissimo che in un giorno nn si può gustare a pieno la bellezza di questa città.,ce ne vogliono minimo 4 di giorni ma almeno ho assaporato un pò la magnificenza di questo luogo.Il centro di Firenze nn è enorme quindi lo si visita molto bene abbastanza in fretta (se nn si entra in nessun museo altrimenti vi vogliono 2 giorni) si mangia bene e nn è carissima quindi che cosa state aspettando andateci!Da Venezia ci si mette 2h20min con l'eurostar per c.ca € 68 andata e ritorno"
50,“1 semaine de rève !”,"En famille, nous avons passé un séjour d'une semaine à Florence en avril 2007.Ce fut tout simplement sublime et très agréable.La culture et l'histoire, les visites multiples , l'art, les parfums, la douce chaleur du printemps nous ont tout simplement séduit et nous y retournerons très prochainement !"
30,“Molta pubblicità...ma niente di che”,"Sono stato un week end a Firenze.Ho girato moltissimo, i vari musei, le chiese, i monumenti ecc..ecc.Ritengo che Firenze sia una città discreta.Il Duomo è bello, come anche il campanile, le chiese, il battistero ecc...però non mi ha segnato poi molto.Forse è troppo pubblicizzata rispetto a quella che poi da effettivamente.Di certo non può essere paragonata con città come Roma, Venezia o anche città più piccole e meno famose.(sempre rimanendo in Italia)Poi tutto molto costoso e tutto a pagamento.Musei e chiese si pagano e anche molto care.Anche come organizzazione in alcuni punti lascia un po a desiderare.Faccio l'esempio del campanile dove ci si incrocia tra salita e discesa e questo può portare anche problemi di ""mancanza di ossigeno"" a differenza di Parigi dove a Notre Dame i tratti di scala comune venivano regolate da persone che dicevano quando salire e quando aspettare la gente che scendeva.Probabilmente Firenze è più gradevole per esperti di arte che possono perdersi in ogni quadro presente agli Uffizi rispetto a me che sono un profano.In conclusione belle le chiese e belli i monumenti...ma non mi ha lasciato quel qualcosa in più.."
