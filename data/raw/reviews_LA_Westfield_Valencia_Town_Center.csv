Besides having major anchor stores such as Macy's, Sears, Apple Store and several other nice shops, there is also a nice food court with about something for everyone. The mall has some nice seating inside or out. There's even a fire pit outside with seating all around.

40,Nice mix of stores & restaurants,"Westfield Valencia Town Center is better than the average mall, but a bit dead on one side since Sears closed their store. With adjacent outdoor stores and restaurants, the shopping center is a nice destination location, especially with Edwards movie theaters.",Jerry Crawford
40,Better thsn the average mall,This is a smallish mall but is clean and tidy. It has plenty of free parking and many of the big brand shops and a good macys.

50,"Good shopping, great eats!","This is not the largest mall you'll go to, not by a long shot! But! There are good shops to peruse and there are many great restaurants in the center as well. Lazy Dawg, Wokano, and my personal favorite, Bone Fish Grill are all excellent choices for a decent meal. One of the movie theaters is right close by as well, making this a good central location to shop, dine, and see a show.",James D

Perfect for couple and kids alike. Lots of little shops and tons of restaurants. The lights in the evenings are beautiful. A real treat.,joyhope
50,Great experience as always,"We love going to Souplantation. They serve a lovely fresh and varied salad at the entrance, where kids can choose their own veggies. Then, kids can go and serve themselves with as much food as they want, there's usually 2-3 different types of pasta (the Mac n cheese is AMAZING!!!). Then there's pizza, garlic bread, varied flavoured soups, bread rolls, baked potatoes and fillings. For dessert, there's a lovely ice cream machine, kids LOVE serving their own I've cream in the little cones, there's a few types of toppings: sprinkles, fresh fruit, cream, crushed cookies, nuts...There's also a drink machine that serves various soft drinks, sodas and lemonade and there's ice Yes, water, Apple juice, tea and coffee.The staff are very good at keeping up with the dirty plates and taking them away, making space for you to get a new plate of food.The staff are friendly, the dining area is clean and the food is always fresh. An absolute joy to go to and eat as a family.",leila201435
30,Not a bad one of its type,Westfield Valencia is a big sprawling shopping centre with many of the usual suspects for a mid market area. Macy’s. Sears JC Penney et alParking seems plentiful and as it never rains in Southern California as the song goes the lack of cover won’t be a problem except in very hot weather. Convenient for locals,bigvicSydney
30,It's a Mall,Not my demographics. Not much of a shopper but more of a buyer. Amazon is my place. Valencia Town center is nicely located and offers a variety of places to throw your money away. A nice selection of restuarants. That is whu I go.,thibbs1955
20,It's just a mall,News flash another mall. Lol. The usual cast of characters as it relates to stores. The outside area restaurants is a good mix.,1kenny
30,Too many skateboarders,"Malls are about shopping and now that there is an abundance of stores once again, the outside as well as inside should be free of the dreaded skateboarders. (Not) It would be nice to have a skate park, but the signs state no skateboards yet its not enforced.",Opie T
50,Beautiful and inviting!,"This mall is beautiful! It has done an amazing job of marrying the traditional mall with the outdoor mall experience. The traditional mall is open, cool, clean and inviting with many top notch stores. The outdoor mall is gorgeous! There are meandering pathways over ponds that are filled with fish and turtles! There are lots of seating areas with beautiful large umbrellas for shade. It is as if a mall was opened at a park! It is also dog friendly which is evident by the water fountain for humans and dogs that has a container of dog treats on top! I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and look forward to coming back soon.",Karen J
30,Local Mall - Better Eats than Shopping,"The title says it all, hohum sears, jcpenney I thought they closed already and a run down Macys is all this place has to offer from the major chain, the restaurants however have really picked up starting on town center, Bj's, Larsens, Cheesecake, the movies, Golds Gym but the mall itself is TIRED, adult shopping is extremely limited for executive or business clothing",bill g
40,"Small but very nice mall, lots of good shops and food places","Westfield is just a 2-level mall, the main buiilding housing many shops and several restaurants. The town center in general has many other shops. Within the mall, the walkways were very well-designed and landscaped and there are appropriate directional signs for the shops that can be found. Good place to shop and eat.",sabi0james

50,Loved It,"This mall is great. It has inside and outside areas for shopping, a nice variety of stores, and is kept up well. The dining/snack places are also impeccable.

50,Nice Mall!,"I like this nice, clean Mall with plenty of good restaurants and ample free parking. Coming here is far less stressful than going to the more crowded malls in LA or the Valley.",Anne G
50,"One of the best shopping experiences in California -- all the ""right"" stores","In California, if you are a serious shopper, aways start with the outlet centers -- first quality at serious savings. When you are finished with the outlet centers, this mall should be at the top of your list for the northern Los Angeles area. All the top stores are there -- certainly all the higher priced brand names, plus the places never in the outlet centers (such as Apple) and a lot of quite good places to eat -- food court and sit down restaurants.",Edward B
40,Always something New,"In the 18 years I have lived in Santa Clarita, the malls come and go but this one continues to grow, and offer fine dinning and retail",Opie T
50,Fun place to waist time,"If you have young kids they will be entertained here, a small play area inside and one outside, inside is for toddlers and outside has both toddler and bigger kid play area. Located in the middle of the outside mall is a pond with koi and catfish with a few turtles. Train rides can be purchased as well as carousel rides, and of course they have a Apple Store with gadgets galore!",Rob B
50,Lively mall that caters to all ages,"This mall has evolved into a lively place to shop, dine, play, or just hangout. Variety of shops from affordable boutiques to pricey named brand stores. Family friendly that offers entertainment for toddlers and young kids. It's my one stop shop to pamper myself from pedi/manicure, hair, & masage. Finally, to shop and dine.",Sol R
50,Very nice and big Mall,"The Mall seems to be brand new, plenty of brand name stores and places to eat. People here are friendly and the whole area of the Mall is very nice. Worth a visit.",Sergio B
40,A lovely restful place ~,This is a lovely and beautiful place to shop and relax. We live in Lancaster so when the car needs service we wait in the town center. Lunch & shopping an enjoyable afternoon.,A_V_Wedding_Lady
50,A Mall with Everything,"This mall has everything! Here for another soccer tournament and we found good foods, cool temps, ample parking, movies!",webinvisible
50,Shopping,We went there to shop. It was a very nice mall. I liked that there were shops inside the mall and outside. We walked in the fresh air which was wonderful since the weather was so great.We then went inside to the main stores such as Macy's which was pleasant to walk in.This is a very nice mall since it combines the best of both indoor and out.,marcie C
10,Cart vendor,Beware of the cart vendors that are sanctioned/licensed/certified by Westfield at the Westfield Valencia Town Center mall. They are unscrupulous and shady in their dealings. Sportula in particular.It will be a long time before I purchase another item from a cart vendor at a Westfield mall because in my opinion they do a poor job of selecting and policing them.,James F
50,plenty of shoppes,"The mall is very nicely laid out, plenty of restaurants and specialty stores. During the holidays they add extra carts that have nice products.",Dave K
40,Love it!,Love the mall and the stores outdoor space and restaurants attached. Great atmosphere when shopping and eating. The staff in most stores a friendly and helpful. Parking is getting a little tide and some stores in need to upgrade.,Henri B
50,good !,good mall with lots of stores to go shopping and restaurants with good food. Very difficult to find a parking spot.,Basma B
50,Something for everyone!,"This mall is constantly evolving and just keeps getting better! With more recent additions of Apple, Sephora, Lululemon, MAC, Michael Kors, as well as several nice restaurants (Wokano, Lazy Dog, Lucille's BBQ, Lyfe Kitchen, California Fish Market), it has become a destination worth traveling to. All that is now missing ... a Nordstrom and better parking for the patios area of the mall.",KerrieCA
40,If only they had enough parking!!,"Be sure to fill the gas tank when heading to Valencia Town Center (or park way in the back, on the North side), because parking is IMPOSSIBLE!! But, it's clean, and the limited selection of shops is pretty good...especially if you want to browse in a dozen chain jewelry stores, or hit the Apple store.",vinojeff
50,Very well done mall,"I was a mall rat for many years. As a grown up rat, I wasn't very happy with malls I've gone to until I found this one.The mall is very big, and is surrounded by extensive parking on three sides. If walking is difficult for you, preview where you want to go first and view it on Google maps first to plan where to enter and park, it's that big. If you enjoy walking, it's actually a great place just to get in some nice walking.The mall has a huge variety of restaurants, from fast food to actual fine dining.The people who tend to come to this mall are a pretty diverse crowd of nice people, most people in the Santa Clarita Valley are simply families living in suburbia.There are many promenade shops where you can walk in the sun and visit shops, or you can go inside to the huge indoor portion.The mall has Sears, Macy's, JC Pennys as anchor stores. The mall also happens to be located near a HUGE amount of other major chain stores on the surrounding blocks. Shop till you drop, people!They have a variety of clothing stores, but nothing on the ultra high end. Some of the boutiques have pricier and more fancy clothing. But affordable clothing abounds in many well-staffed and well-stocked locations.There really is something for everyone at this mall.The thing is, I feel kind of like a kid again when I come there, I know that sounds nostalgic, but the cleanliness and ""bigness"" of it just takes me back. My wife and I go to this mall a couple times a month, sometimes with nothing in mind other than just walking around.",Michael G
50,Great mall,I had an awesome time shopping here! Had many shops we do not have at home-I like to find something new. Beautiful location - easy to shop.,joburglaura
