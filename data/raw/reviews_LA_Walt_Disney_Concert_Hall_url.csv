Many good vignettes that explained the origins of the project and how it ""fits"" in downtown L.A.

This Symphony No. 2 in C minor, “Resurrection”. Today Zubin Mehta conducted the program, 80 minutes without an intermission.

I was the first human to create progressive inventive architecture like this in LA's once run down 21st century.Don't miss,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovesdogs3
20,Pretty Building,"Nice building, wouldn’t make a special trip to see, unless you have tickets to go to an event. There isn’t much too exciting around (although a short walk to city hall, which is worth a look). I love architecture, and will walk a long way to get a good picture, but big barricade around building (cement to probably keep folk off)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live4Strength
50,Awesome Tour and Great evening,"The docent led tours by the Symphonians is GREAT. You get tour of Walt Disney Concert Hall, Dorthy Chandler, Mark Taper and Ahmanson....for FREE. Being in the Walt Disney concert hall is AMAZING and there truly is not a bad seat in the house. We enjoyed a ""casual Friday"" evening with the LA Phil and guest pianist, with a talk before the show about the composers. Really a nice night out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LocationVacation
50,Wow!,This building is so awe inspiring! Free Tour. Friendly staff. (Would benefit from lists of workers involved in construction to balance many lists of donors!!),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478kathleeny
50,Fantastic tour by Fabiola,We had an interesting and informative tour with Fabiola yesterday. She is super knowledgeable and inspiring about her appreciation for all that is offered ..and I promised her we would go to our first opera after hearing about her experience in being in one. Definitely recommend one of her tours vs. the self guided.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susancR4169CW
50,What a gorgeous building,Beautiful both inside and out this is a lovely building where I saw a magnificient performance of the LA Opera Choral. Go if you get the opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/343eddiew
20,"Enjoy the architecture on the outside and the garden, skip going inside.","We enjoyed walking around the outside of the building and seeing the uniqueness of the metal curves and the garden was a nice place to relax. We did the free self guided tour, it just seemed long and boring, you cannot go into the music hall itself, just the ""hall areas"". I don't even think that musical buffs would think this worthwhile since you don't see the hall itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420jeane
40,Gorgeous but tight seating.,"It's a beautiful hall, beautiful acoustics. The walking areas are great with the interior foyers and atria, as well as the gardens. The bars are easy to deal with especially with the order-ahead for intermission. It was quite lovely.My one star ding here is very specific to me in that I have a leg injury I am rehabbing that doesn't (and shouldn't) merit disabled status. In other theaters I have been able to contort myself in such a way as to keep myself comfortable. The seats here restrict movement (probably for the better in general) in such a way that I couldn't make it more than 45 minutes, and there didn't seem to be any standing areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X975TUstevem
50,Worth it!,Absolutely stunning architecture! The free guided tour is very informative and interesting. Really worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pal09
50,We only climbed the outside,"But what a great space! The fact that they have public space hidden up there is amazing. There are some great foliage, a fountain and even an amphitheater. Wish we lived closer so we could utilize both the outside space and the hall itself to hear some music. Frank Gehry outdid himself here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/difish
50,Establishing a standard for musical listening,"The Disney Hall is establishing the standard and new directions for the art of listening and spectatorship of classical music. The architecture is compelling (just like major music halls of the past aimed to be distinguished), representing the importance that the arts should ave in a community; but it is also set up for new modes of presentation involving video and community interaction. It is worth seeing and experiencing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Musicandartstraveler
50,Among the best acoustics in the world,"I have been here many times for concerts and each time, I am gobsmacked by the acoustics, the seating which offers great vantage (and sound) experiences from every seat. As a lover of architecture as much as art and music, I am as much in love with the exterior as I am impressed by the interior, the acoustics and the various musical offerings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer649924
40,Awesome facility,This is an awesome performance venue. The audio tour is great and all is free. It would have been nice to have seen the auditorium. Unfortunately the day we were there it was raining and we were skirting buckets and towels on the floors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123texastraveler2016
30,Concert Hall,This concert hall is very nice. They have guided tours or self audio tours. We were disappointed that we were not actually able to see the auditourium were the concerts are actually held. It looked beautiful on the TV they have displayed in the hall. Just think doors to the auditourium should have been open even if not allowed to enter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CodyS1227
30,Worth a quick drive past.....,"If you are touring LA then I suggest you at least drive past the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It's an ultra modern steel structure worth a quick look, but not a great deal else to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem
40,Great concert hall with nice cafe,"Any event at Disney is wonderful. The acoustics are amazing and there is no bad seat.Also worth a visit is the Cafe. This is a good spot for a snack or light dinner. There are premade salads and a salad bar, sandwiches, hot sandwiches from a press, and hot entrees with sides. There are usually three kinds of soups. Desserts are premade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankp74
50,The building is the equal to the music,"This is a sublime building, inside and out. This is a good trip for kids who like to go on short tours. The ceiling of the concert hall looks like the bottoms of wooden ships. The seating is divided into sections so that you don't feel like you're sitting behind a lot of people. The acoustics are wonderful. Then, there's the iconic outisde. My grandchildren had a great time (although they were skeptical at first.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donuthole15
50,Took bus tour - day trip from San Diego to Los Angeles,"We live in San Diego and did not want to bother driving back and forth to see Gustavo Dudamel conduct the LA Philharmonic Orchestra so we took a day trip via ""Day Trippers"" out of La Mesa, CA. We were first ones picked up and last ones dropped off of 4 stops on the way to LA. Total of about a 12 hr. trip. Great ride in limo bus. Beautiful concert hall location, about 2.5 hrs free time to walk around and have lunch at various locations near concert hall. We ate in the actual Disney Hall at their Cafe - a bit pricey for soup and salad bar (charged by weight). Other restaurants near by were about 1/2 the price. Beautiful garden on 3rd floor of concert hall. Hall looks like it is closed when you get their early for 2 PM show, but doors are open and you can go up to the garden or have lunch, or see artwork inside too. One block away from Our Lady of the Angeles Cathedral. They also have gardens, exhibits, cafe along with their Sunday Services, but would have been in Spanish for the time we got there. We got to hear music of John Williams and he was there in person and was acknowledge at the end of the concert up on stage - fantastic concert to celebrate our 50th anniversary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonora95
40,nice building,during the day it is wonderful to go upstairs to the roof-top-garden and hang out. I bought some lunch in the Hill.St food-court and had a wonderfull and relaxed time up there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564-knut
50,Beautiful and so well designed.,Saw a one man performance here (Trey) and really enjoyed the experience. They really did a great job so that every seat feels intimate and close to the stage. The sound design is absolutely superb. Plenty of catering/bar options on each floor which makes attending the theater even more enjoyable. Always love my Disney Hall experiences. A must visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MooshLA
50,Stunning,"Stunning building, inside and out. The outside has this wavy shape made of out steel that shines during the day. The interior is beautiful. The sounds just fills the entirety of the hall. The view is amazing regardless of where you are seated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
50,Love the WDCH !,"We love the WDCH, and have enjoyed differtn type of evenings from the Singalong to White Christmas, to the John Williams concert with movie music scores played by the LA Philharmonic conducted by Dudamel. great easy $ 9 parking and really there is not a bad seat in the house",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
50,Fantastic acoustics and comfortable seating,"We enjoyed two concerts here. The acoustics were brilliant and though we sat high up, the sound and views were excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros57
50,Futuristic Building,"The architecture is like nothing I have ever seen. The lines are clean and curved. The acoustics are said to be perfect. If you can't take a tour, do a walk around of the building. Does honor to Disney and a great city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ1912
50,Fascinating Tour!,We recently did the one-hour guided tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The building itself is a marvel and captures your eye amongst all the other downtown buildings.The docent was friendly and provided a well rounded tour of the building but also the surrounding area. Throughout the tour you get to see some inner workings and we even got a sneak peak inside the auditorium.There were only five of us in total on this complimentary tour and it covered areas you couldn’t get to on your own.The garden was such a highlight and was like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of the city. We just arrived 15 minutes prior to the tour and they don’t take reservations in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholastb
50,One of the most modern buildings in downtown Los Angeles,We had a chance to Visit this building in downtown LA. It is just a fabulous work of architecture. The outside gardens and fountains were very interesting. his is one of the most beautiful building in the world... You must go and experience this building. We are glad we had a chance this building while visiting an exhibit at the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627edj
50,"Great sound, intimate setting.","I went for the first time last night, and really enjoyed it! Itzhak Perlman was in concert, and the sound was tremendous.Only thing I had a problem with was the legroom, and room for my big feet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
50,This Frank Geary designed building takes your breath away.,"I do like Frank Geary even though his work does not really fall in line with what I think are appropriate for buildings such as this - think9ng something more like The Academy of Music in Philadelphia! But that is not fair. The buidliing is indeed a piee of sculpture on Grand Avenue. And the concert hall, well the acoustics speak for themselves. i have been here before for performances of the LA Phil and that was the reason for this visit as well. My wife and I came all the way from VT to hear a performance of Olivier Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony. If you ever have the opportunity you shouild attend. And if you can attend at WDCH, well that is even bnetter. Spectacular building, and the music, well words fail me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twomartinilunch
50,Always Sparkles and Impresses,"I have been a subscriber for many years. I continue to marvel at the interior and the incredible sound. Seeing anything here is a treat. Its a ""must do"" for LA visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conniemccreight
50,Amazing concert experience,"By far he best pure ""sound"" available in any concert hall. Every seat has a clear view and you can hear every note so clearly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevensC6641CP
40,"Picturesque place, it does not matter the angle.","I need to start this review with: I did not get in the Concert Hall, just admired it from outside and walk around. If you wanted to read more about it, skip this review.I guess I am writing this for those short in time, without a ticket to get in or without the intention to spend money to get in.The facade of the building is simply put: outstanding. Its shape distract your mind from each of the curves to its sharp angles to the beautiful contrasts between the white concrete of its footpath to the blue sky of California. I pulled my camera as soon as I saw the building, mesmerised with its aesthetics as I continued walking towards it.Get around one of its nook, stand in front of it, under its shade, all around! It is a stunning building and I can only imagine what it looks on the inside. I tried to get a ticket but everything was sold out for the day.Nevertheless, it is a beautiful picture, captured in my memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodrigoelp
50,White Christmas Sing a long - we all sang along!,We attended the White Christmas sing l along on December 22 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. the hall is beautiful and for this special occasion they had place a large screen on stage for us to watch the movie. At the end they dropped tissue paper snowflakes from the ceiling. The theater was packed with folks of all ages which was cute to see but many of the folks were 60+ and enjoyed singing every song! Great idea for the holiday season!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Allegro13
50,Holiday Sing Along,"Came to the Disney Concert Hall for the first time for the White Christmas Sing along. There is not a bad seat! If you choose a balcony seat there is plenty of ""pitch"" that you are not looking at someones head! The sound is amazing too",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorihas2
40,Architecture,The building is very interesting architecturally and it has a nice garden. We were here for a reception and the setting was lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryannS60101
50,Fantastic Holiday Performance,"We enjoyed the holiday sing-along with Melissa Peterman at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on Dec. 22. Our granddaughters really enjoyed the performance and got to sing along. This concert hall is small enough so you can see the stage and performers easily. The seats wrap all the way around the stage, but I would recommend being on the second level off to either side. If you are seated in the rear, although you can enjoy the performance, you will not be able to view the large screen which has words to sing along. This is a very modern and nice concert hall right in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Takara1
50,Salute to Vienna,Our tour included a concert at the Walt Disney Cooncert Hall. There are no bad seats and they were very comfortable. Was my first visit and would visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirleyfoemmel
50,Not a bad seat in the house.,There are no bad seats in the hall. Unlike most performance halls the seating is roomy and comfortable. The acoustics are amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbpotter1
50,Best possible music experience,"Disney Hall offers what's been called the best concert hall acoustics in the nation, maybe the world. The LA Philharmonic is now the best in the U.S., offering a rich combination of old and new music, along with jazz and popular music events, along with the world's best conductors, including Gustavo Dudamel. The building itself is art, inside and out. It houses a smaller venue, Redcat, for experimental music and theater, and both a pre-concert cafe and a fine dining restaurant. Even taking a short tour of the space is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judy93035

50,A great venue for a concert,"Saw Trey Anastasio (from Phish) here in early December. The venue is modern, exciting, and very intimate. Sound is amazing, no reverb or echo. Easy in/Easy out with good flow, comfortably seating, and a great staff to guide you. Parking is plentiful nearby with lots of options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1742TFscotts
50,Fantastic!!,"My husband and I went to the Disney Concert Hall to hear/ see Handels Messiah. What a fantastic time we had. The concert hall is absolutely beautiful. Unique architecture, amazing acoustics and the the show itself was off the charts.We sat on the right side of the center and the seats were excellent. It didn't look like there were any bad seats althôugh I would not choose to sit behind the stage. Highly recommended!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crystalr454

50,great acoustics,"our fourth visit to the hall and second concert this time. the layout of the hall, the acoustics, the whole experience are very special. we have enjoyed the mid-level terrace seating, above the orchestra level, and it has great sound and excellent sightlines. even if you don't see a concert, it is possible to visit the hall to enjoy the architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk

50,Wow! Special Hall for the LA Phil to play; wonderful to listen/watch a concert!,"Have now been to the Walt Disney Hall a few times during our recent trips to LA. What a special place to see a concert, specifically the LA Phil! Not a bad seat in the house, stunning architecture, fascinating choices of woods and colors, not an orthogonal place in the structure....and a truly lively and wonderful sound. This has to be one of the best places on the planet for gorgeous sound from voices and orchestra simultaneously. Highly recommend that you buy tickets on line or in person ahead of time..and not hard to do if you plan ahead. Absolutely a special place to hear live music from a very special group of talented musicians!And BTW, parking is very close nearby; across the street and underground, at least six floors below street level and spacious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smitty09876
50,Must see Frank Gehry,"This is a must see Gehry building that rivals his masterpiece Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, Spain. We spent about 45 minutes studying the outside and we're lucky that a tour or the inside was available. Everything about the venue is extraordinary. LA Philharmonic plays here and would love to go to a concert. Acoustics are extraordinary. But even if you can only drive or walk by YOU MUST.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
40,"Fun to see, but make it a longer downtown adventure",It's definitely an LA icon that's fun to see and knock off the bucket list. I ended up parking a few blocks away down the hill from it for like $9 or something on Black Friday. There are some nice little cafe's near by if you want a snack or some lunch and if I could have seen a show that would have been amazing!!Personally now that I've seen more of the city and if I hadn't been on a bit of a time crunch I'd park and venture around or if possible add a night tour on after. There's lot of history to the city and if it interests you see all you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marisab679
40,"Beautiful, but...","It's beautiful outside and inside is gorgeous wood, but the fabric used and the carpet are completely hideous. Also, using wood stairs when most women go to the opera in heels, which make a lot of noise on wood? NOT the brightest move.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatKealy
50,"Amazing venue, worth a visit even if you don't see a show","We went to Disney Concert Hall and did the tour of the venue which was included in the ticket price for the Philharmonic Orchestra show that we saw. This is an amazing venue with such history and so worth seeing. The performance from the Orchestra (LA Phil) was also mind blowing. We were right up the back but the view was still perfect and it was just spellbinding to watch a show here. Highly recommend seeing a show and doing the tour. The LA Phil shop also has some great and really interesting items, perfect for gifts for yourself or those back at home if travelling o/s. Loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyLyn
50,A Dream Come True,"We visited LA a couple of years ago and wanted to see a concert in the WD concert hall, however it was Summer and there were no shows whilst we were in the area so having kept an eye on shows (that were good enough to get us back across the Atlantic) for the last 2 years we were able to get tickets to see Moby with the LA Philharmonic and the Jason White Gospel singers, the performances from everyone were amazing, including the LA Mayor Eric Garrett who made a surprise appearance and demonstrated his skills playing Natural Blues on the piano, a rousing finish to a fantastic show.We were able to get tickets in the front row of the balcony which I wouldn't recommend for those who suffer vertigo, the tiering is sufficient that you'll get pretty much the same view from the row B.Not only is the building beautiful inside and outside the acoustics are phenomenal, during the performance there was a huge thunderstorm and it couldn't be heard from inside.The coat check is free and large bags will need to be checked as there's limited space under seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/654samr
50,White Christmas Sing-A-Long,We went as a family and every generation enjoyed it. Come early enough to enjoy the Holiday reception before taking your seats.

40,Weird and wonderful,"I have been several times to the Disney, and find it decidedly odd, yet acoustically wonderful. I lived in Dallas, TX for 40 years and went often to the Meyerson Symphony Center which may have the best acoustics I have ever heard. Still, the Disney is not far behind. The building itself is an acquired taste, but I like it, despite the stairs that go nowhere on occasion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCH19462014

50,Awesome to visit,We went to the concert hall because the building looks beautiful. When we went inside we were told we could take an audio tour through the building.

50,Spectacular architecture,"If you are interested in architecture, you should visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It was designed by Frank Gehry, just as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. It does offer tours, and senior citizen concerts at a discount.This concert hall is not on the top 10 must-see sites in LA, probably because LA has too many of them, and the emphasize is on the Hollywood side. However, we were just intrigued by the architecture, the ribbon like outside. You will not regret seeing it if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsiak01
50,Wonderful,Very cool!Parking is underground and easy!There are places to eat - very decent! Nothing five star or table service but good variety and lots of people seem to take advantage of it!There are no bad seats. If you want to be closer it will cost you more but it’s a great place.The sound is ridiculously awesome!The staff is helpful and there are plenty of people to help.It’s a must go place if you find a performance you may like.If you only have time to visit outside - it’s worth it also.

50,Mesmerising light projector show at night,"Stumbled across this on a night walk. They were projecting light shows on the outside of the building, synced to dis year music. The car park across the road from it had been set up as a free viewing area and it was perfect. The staff were very friendly and the show aptly magical.Very easy to get to by both bus and train.

50,Outside is an architecture photographer's dream come true,"I have yet to make it inside the Hall for an actual event but I visit once every other month or more to take photos of the building from the outside.

40,World Class Walt Disney Concert Hall,"We went on a Sunday evening for the Mozart Requiem. There was valet parking for $23 but we went to self-park for $9. Keep in mind that many of the restaurants near the Hall are closed on weekends because they largely cater to the work week crowds, so plan accordingly.Okay, so obviously the Hall is world-class with great beauty and acoustics. There really are no bad seats in my opinion but I pretty much always buy the cheapest seats I can find with a family of seven. Since the seating capacity is just over 2,000 it’s easy getting in and out and it never feels too crowded.Sitting in the balcony, though, does have a few disadvantages. We felt like we were racing to the restrooms and the bar during intermission with very little time to spare. And if you don’t get back to your seat quickly you could get locked out. Five more minutes would’ve been perfect.Finally, if you have the time, make a day out of it. The Hall is close to a lot of stuff, including: The Broad, Little Tokyo, The Cathedral, Angel’s Flight, and much, much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9447PXjohns
50,Stop for photo opportunity.,We stopped for 5 minutes for a photo opportunity. When I return to LA I would have the Walt Disney Concert Hall on my list of places to tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miz_emma11
50,Great free tour when in Downtown LA.,Such a great little stop over when in Downtown LA. The tour is free which is a bonus.You are provided with a headset and you walk about the concert hall and explains about the history of how they built the concert hall and where they go their fantastic ideas from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleigh462018
40,Interesting free tour,We enjoyed an opportunity to walk the interior and exterior of the building which is beautiful and worth the trip. We couldn't look in the hall itself as there was a rehearsal which was disappointing but understandable. Recommend going. Everyone was very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HennessyWhite
50,Free informative tour,"You can self guide yourself through the Walt Disney concert hall using the handheld guide system. The tour is ordered into numbers which you plug into the guide system to hear information about. It was informative and you can take things at your own pace. Understanding how the architecture came about and the planning of design concepts added a layer of appreciation to the concert hall experience. There are toilets on every level, as well as a cafe on ground level if you get hungry. Note: If you do the self guided tour, you can't go into the actual concert hall itself. There are also guided tours by a tour guide, but they have set times for those, so better that check before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352lucyg
50,A timeless architectural wonder,"One may not have the funds to go to Bilbao, Spain to check out the wonder that is Frank Gehry’s Guggenheim but if you’re in Souther California this place is a must. It really it’s an architectural wonder and if you’re just a teen looking for Instagram worthy photos then look no further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1677CVjosep
50,Must-go if visiting Los Angeles,There is music for all tastes and lots of great places to eat nearby. Check the calendar and buy in advance for best seating if you can. There are last minute seats availabe for many concerts too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tongotuesday
50,Beautiful and wonderful,"We had a very good docent guide, a college level music student, i believe, who gave us a great tour. The Hall is gorgeous, of course, and perfectly situated for people visiting LA. Outdoor sculpture and lovely seating areas in drought tolerant landscaping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneL337
50,"Wonderful architecture, even better acoustics","Frank Gehry created a wonderfully memorable building - although they had to buff out the high gloss shine on the exterior panels, because the reflection was melting the sidewalk and parked cars (!). As fun as the exterior of the building is, you really have to visit the gardens in the rear of the hall, because they're very beautifully done and peaceful. And lots of shade, which is a good thing in Downtown L.A.The interior of the building is filled with unexpected angles and warm wood veneers, which offset the metal cladding, warming up the entire space. But you really have to see an event in the hall, because the acoustics are really very good. The whole space feels warm and intimate - and that organ is insane.The cafe has some good food and the concert hall shop has fantastic items, from music to clothing and fun toys for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chappsnet
40,Stunning view,"Especially if you’re into architecture, this building is well worth the visit. A stunning folded envelope blazing with light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crShelidon

40,Nice Gardens and beautiful Concert Stage,We signed in to take the free self guided audio tour and enjoyed learning about the history and features of the concert hall. To get the audio guide we had to give the person a photo ID which was returned after we gave back the audio device.During this visit the actual concert venue was open so we got to go inside to see the stage and decor. The backdrop design behind the stage was an amazing piece of woodwork. I am sure it would be an amazing experience to catch a concert here.We followed the audio guide tour through to the garden which was a nice surprise to see trees and plants growing. There was a lot of shade so one could hang out and enjoy.A set of stairs led us up to the top and snaked around the front of the building. There were nice views of the downtown area but it was hot with no shade and the sun reflecting off the metal walls magnified the effects.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA
50,Stunning Architecture,Even if you aren't able to attend one of the concerts if you are a fan of beautiful architecture it is worth a visit to this iconic Love Angeles location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanas1
50,Amazing,"If like like Disney, this is another great stop! Very interesting to read about how this came to be. The pictures outside speak for themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annapN7702ZW
50,Check out the secret garden on the rooftop terrace,"This is a stunning building. I was roaming downtown and stumbled upon this beauty. There are stairs that lead up to a tranquil shaded garden with excellent views. If you continue walking, you can go all the way to the top level (up more stairs) to get amazing views of this building's unique architecture and downtown. I'm sure the guided and audio tours are wonderful as well, but just the gardens (open to the public) are worth a quick visit on their own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knoe
50,Great building and garden,"This is a beautiful building. There are self guided tours with an audio guide(English only), and docent tours (10:15am and 12:30pm the day we were there- 7/27) we chose the self guided tour, signed in and left an ID for the audio guide and spent an hour and a half taking the tours and enjoying the garden) Keep your parking card with you, they will validate in building parking reducing the cost- and it’s good all day. We had lunch in the cafe at the lobby level and the food was fresh and all we tried was tasty (This is cafe food- toasted sandwiches some composed plate lunches and a salad bar by the ounce- pick your choices pay and find a table.) If you are interested in architecture and or acoustics this is a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MvStory
40,We did the free Audio tour,A great and interesting place to visit. We can learn a lot about the architecture and history about this modern looking structure.What I learnt was that this building is not at all dark and deary inside. The natural lighting comes from outside light coming in via the cleverly designed interiors and glass panels in the rooftop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/budakSFO
50,Great Experience !!,"We went for a concert on a week night. To start they had some wine on the patio and what better way to start on a beautiful February night in LA …. being from Connecticut, it is pretty awesome to be hanging that time of year -winter- without 5 layers of clothing.The concert hall is stunning, both inside and out, and the sound and sight lines were well designed. If you get a chance just go … doesn't matter what the event … it is a great venue",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/old-man-orange
40,Interesting Building,Visited here this past Sunday while in LA. It was free which was nice. We decided to do an individual audio tour rather than wait an hour for a guided tour. The audio tour was narrated by John Lithgow. It was very interesting - we learned all kinds of information about the design of the building as well as interviews from the builder and Lillian Disney who had a vision for what the building should be. The gardens were beautiful and peaceful! I would definitely recommend visiting this place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because we didn't get to see the actual concert hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cttraveler66
50,Beautiful and Free!,The tour is free. Walt Disney Concert Hall is beautiful. We parked our car at the underground parking. The parking was $20. You could park your car at a nearby parking at a cheaper rate. We were allowed to see the main concert hall which is wonderful. The outside balconies offers excellent views of LA. The area is nice and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The building is amazing outside and inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BangkokSachse
50,Spectacular and Sublime,"Do not forget to go and see Disney Concert Hall, built by Frank Gehry. It is an inspiration for creativity, for people who think outside the box. Modern design can be glorious. I totally fell in love with that building. At the back of the building, you'll find a beautiful garden where nature and modern lines meet and agree. Congratulation Mr. Gehry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SylvianeD793
30,Beautiful architecture,"Stunning architecture, well worth a visit, would give it more stars but seemed little to do in the area and also it appeared when we visited mid morning nothing to actually see in the concert hall, but still glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hilary005
50,A masterpiece of architecture and a brilliant orchestra!,"This is one of the places we go to as often as wen can. From the outside, Disney Hall is a masterpiece of architecture, Frank Gerhy at his most brilliant. Inside (despite the dingy dining area, where the food is nevertheless good), the concert hall itself never ceases to thrill me — the orchestra is brilliant, and the hall itself just marvelous. This is a must-visit for cultured out of owners!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
50,Tour was excellent.,"One of the best examples of Gehry's work. Guide was knowledgeable and went to nooks and crannies, even inside the hall, Chandler Pavilion, which I'm told are not guaranteed.Don't test the volunteer guides. They kicked out visitors who strayed from group and photo takers who had been warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFF34
50,Stunning place,Stunning architecture. It was a wonderful experience to hear 2000 people singing in this concert hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afrikaanspoppie
30,Jazz concert,"Place is very nice. Very good acoustics. They sell beverages out in the hallway, but you cannot bring them inside.Seating is terribly cramped with little to no legroom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7794NMdonnah
50,musical wonderland,"We have been season subscribers for a third year now and love it. We are part of a classical music series which is a pleasant change of pace from today's music genres.The acoustics at the Hall are excellent no matter where you are seated. with no obstructed views of the stage. The line up of artists has been world renowned. And the atmosphere always seems festive. Even though we travel a distance (from Huntington Beach), we continue to look forward to each and every concert at the Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcT239
50,One of the World's Finest Architectural Masterpieces!,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is an architectural marvel from the outside and the inside. Most days the lobby area is open to the public and you can do a self-guided tour or a 1 hour audio tour--both are FREE! The attention to detail, natural lighting, colors, textures are awesome. Do the audio tour which provides much of the background information on the various points of interest. The Walt Disney Concern Hall is across the steer\t from the The Broad Museum, so you can combine both for an amazing day of 5-star venues. Both very walkable from the Civic Center Metro station 2 blocks away. Makes a perfect walking tour day in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel92630
30,Visited the gardens only - lovely...but music too would have been wonderful!,We used angels flight and then walked around the Walt Disney Concert Hall Gardens.The gardens are lovely and I’m sure a very peaceful retreat in this presumably normally busy area. We visited on the Sunday Morning of memorial weekend - the gardens and area were deserted!We enjoyed our short walk around but I’m sure perhaps some wonderful piped music or a WiFi Link to something that’s been played in the hall previously would be lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownspeeddog
50,"Acoustics are excellent, the outside is a matter of taste.","The seats behind the orchestra had very good acoustics, which is representative of the whole hall: and that's ultimately what makes a good concert hall. As far as the outside is concerned, it's up to you. Myself, I'm not a Gehry fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthurr4
50,An architectural beauty in Downtown La,"When we were there the building was closed. However, the sight is magnificent and worth visiting. In the roof you can find the blue ribbon garden, an urban oasis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juanfranciscog381
30,Sorry,"Sorry, but Disney Hall disappoints. The architecture though often celebrated is not practical n a sunny climate. The interior is uncomfortable and most important the acoustics are meh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbbloch207
10,Walt Disney Concert Hall,The building as such has a unique design but we only had an outside view as the time was too short to have an inside visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neelu257
50,Amazing and Special Place,"This venue is one of the most amazing concert halls in the country. Acoustically and visually this is an incredibly special place. I feel truly lucky every concert I have the privilege to attend and even for just a tour, it is a must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomKunze
50,"A magnificent building, a shame we couldn’t tour inside","What an outstanding piece of architecture, and a place freely open to the public (between the hours of 10 and 2, to our dismay when we missed the final opportunity to tour inside).The exterior of this metallic masterpiece is readily available for exploration, boasting exemplary views across the surrounding skyline, the concert hall provides a first class venue with a artistic twist.I would highly recommend visiting here, and if I get the chance, I will be returning for a tour inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomNIwona
50,Worth it,"We've park in the car park by mistake, so good prize for LA good location to visit downtown. Pay once arriving to the car park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonicaC1924
40,The LA Philharmonic is outstanding in their own proud Concert Hall,"I expected a very beautiful, formal, elegant concert hall but was initially taken aback by this modernistic, highly stylized exterior. Then when I entered the Hall and found my seat I felt like everything was too modest. There was no stage really and the upholstery was not plus in the way that every other classical music facility had been. After just a few minutes I found myself feeling at home in this great room. The acoustics are amazing. The seats are very comfortable. I did not feel intimidated to be in a classical setting. I felt close to the performers rather than separated. I will come back here again and again and be introduced to a level of music I had always stayed away from as much as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy4413
40,Fantastic architecture...,"We walked around the area where the concert hall is located. We didn't feel the need to enter the building as the reason for walking there was to see the wonderful architecture of the building itself. It is a great example of modern and exciting design, the sun shines and glistens on to the metal and reflects back out... worth a visit just to see the outside of building but if you feel inclined you could book to see something at the venue. There are other interesting buildings near by and a short walk from restaurants and markets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellerm68
50,Beautiful Building,The latest addition to the Los Angeles Music Center downtown on Grand. The architecture of this building is a great reason to visit Downtown when you're in the area. This is where the LA Philharmonic performs now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drdroad
50,Gehry at his best,An amazing example of Gehry's architecture - go see the outside even if you don't go to concert here,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7858QOmarkh
50,Fabulous Concert Venue,"We're used to San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, that is in a conventional building and has traditional auditorium type seating where there is a large seating area in front of the stage and various levels of loges and balconies facing the stage in a horseshoe formation.Walt Disney Concert Hall is something else entirely. The Frank Gehry designed building is wrapped in a silvery metal skin somewhat similar to the Guggenheim Museum he designed for Bilbao, Spain. The inside building has numerous levels of seats, all closer to the stage where the Philharmonic performs, so everyone (and not only those in the expensive seats up front) can have a far more intimate connection to the musicians, which we'd only seen in a concert venue in Berlin. Add to that great sight lines and excellent acoustics, it makes one's enjoyment of a performance all the better....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreeAdvicecom
50,Great experience,"We went to a concert there. We got the seats right behind the orchestra. Interesting seating with close up, back view. It was a great experience. Definitely recommended to visit for music lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackieZ353

50,Art & Architecture,I couldnt believe what I was seeing.Outside those very big silver metallic volumes took my breath.Once inside very high concave and convex wooden ceilings with natural light.Frank Gehry is a great great architect and Disney Hall is the place to enjoy his art.The auditorium and concert hall are marvellous and the acoustic is excellent so if you assist to a great show it will be a unique happening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elklix
50,Amazing building,"Very modern, inspiring and amazing building in LA. This is a true masterpiece. Very fun area to walk around as well, with The Broad nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThierryDeVynck
50,A major WOW!,"I have been an early critic of the architecture of the Disney Concert Hall, as a old fogy who is fond of traditional styles of construction. My recent introduction to the interior of the place has done a great deal to moderate my negativity. My Lady and I had tickets to a symphonic performance at the hall, and I was really enamored of our location behind the orchestra, where we could witness all of the permutations required of the members during the performance. The acoustics were marvelous, and the ability to see what the orchestra and the soloists were doing provided a marvelous experience. Can't wait until we go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum

50,A must for architect and music lovers!,"Disney Hall offers two things - amazing music in one of the best acustic halls, and extraordinary architecture by Frank Ghery. This building looks good from the distance, but try the side steps to go up - if you are a photographer, this is the place to take photos of the sun mirroring in the curves of the Hall outside. This is also quite a popular place for newly weds to take their photo sessions. And justly, as the place is really amazing.For the concerts, check W. Disney Hall website - they offer an exceptional variety of choices - jazz, classical music, opera. For concerts I love the seats above the orchestra, somehow it feels good to see all musicians how they react to conductor, and conductor himself/herself - their emotion usually hidden as we see their back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
50,Nice Outdoor Areas Even If You Don't Have a Ticket to Enter,"We walked to the concert hall from the Grand Central Market. We walked up and around the hall, there are stairs leading to different levels and a lovely roof garden in the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cincin2100

The exterior is as spectacular to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reac2014
50,Interesting Architecture,"We actually stumbled across this building by chance as we walked through town without knowing it was a concert hall. The only interaction we had with the building was to use the facilities.That being said, regular concerts and recitals are held here so if thats your thing, then visit to get jiggy with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTwos

40,Sit closer then you enjoy more.,"Bethoven 9 was very good, but if you have choice take seats as close as possible. Tickets are expensive but we may pay more if knew that it would make difference. Music, voices were great. We were sitting in mezzanine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxanau
50,Christmas Special,"We went in December for the Christmas sing-a-long. It was for a the 2pm matinée. We had an amazing time as a family, and there were lots of families with small children.

50,Sir Andras Schiff meets Frank Gehry,"We were fortunate to have planned a trip to Los Angeles while Sir Andras Schiff performed a stellar piano recital of Beethoven, Brahms, Bach, Mozart, and Schumann at Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall. Though the gleaming silver Concert Hall itself has often been viewed in films and commercials, nothing beats standing before it and gazing upwards at its huge, seemingly disjointed panels. The interior, from the concert hall itself to the unexpected balcony garden, is also a visual delight. Though I've never been fortunate to hear the LA Philharmonic perform here, the acoustics for Schiff's solo recital, which led to sustained applause followed by two encores, were fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul_Har
50,Amazing,"Amazing building, wish we could have seen more of it! Fantastic acoustics, stunning performance center, amazing afternoon with the LA Philharmonic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vonjolly

Clearly, acoustics were at the heart of thinking and planning for the interior. But, the exciting exterior is both bold and enticing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG897
50,Beautiful Architecture and Music,I’ve been to see films with live music (very fun at Halloween) as well as chamber music and special guests. Inside it feels like you’re inside Noah’s Arc! I mean that in a good way. It’s lovely to walk around the back of the building to the little garden as well. Very casual salad bar/dining situation but pretty healthy fare. I also grabbed lunch there while on jury duty. Proud to have this venue in my city. It’s beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobaltViolet

50,Great Place for Pictures,"it was not planned although if you take the staircases behind the Concert Hall it will lead you to above the building, giving you a great view of Downtown LA.

50,Free to tour and worth the time,"We were in town for a couple of days when nothing was playing here, but we did the (free!) audio tour. Definitely worth an hour or so of your time. The architecture is really cool, and it's great to wander around the building. I've been in Gehry buildings before, but this is the first time I've really toured one, and hearing his commentary was also very cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dephal

50,Disney Hall is the Epicenter of L.A. Cultural Landscape,"Much has been written about the seismic shift of Arts and Architecture from Chicago and New York to the Left Coast. No greater evidence of this is the transformation of Grand Avenue with its cultural monuments of the Broad, MOCA, and Grand Park, all anchored by Frank Gehry's shiny concert hall. From the outside, whimsical, lighter-than-air pieces impossibly fit together, leaving the observer wondering how can this place house a world class orchestra venue. Once inside the auditorium, the look softens and mellows dramatically; the metallic exterior gives way to red-hued wood adornments. The acoustics are warm and precise, just about what you would want for a hall this size. The East Coast rightly has reason to be jealous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightPro

50,Must-see architecture,"This building is beyond breathtaking. I cannot stress enough that you must stop by this place if you are ever in LA, especially if you love architectural details. It is a plus if you like photographing places. When I was there, there were a ton of professional photographers taking photos - so it must be a popular location for the local photographers. Some wedding portraits and fine art portraits were taken there. Go see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennymZ2865RA
50,Always a fantastic experience at Disney Concert Hall,"I just love coming here. The place is so inspiring in so many ways. The architecture is wonderful, but what happens here presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic is really impressive. If you do nothing more, go visit the amazing LA Phil gift shop. it is stocked with the most wonderful collection of interesting and fun things. Also, the cafe they have there and is open before concerts is really delicious and tasty. I had a delicious soup and salad meal before a concert and wish I could find a place like that where I live. The acoustics and overall experience at WDCH are world-class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KaneoheBoy
50,Amazing inside and out,We specifically came to LA for 2 concerts to be held at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Outside it is a very unique stainless steel construction and a pleasant patio with gardens. Inside was an acoustic (most important part) and visual wonder. Probably the only negative was the artist was prepared to go further both nights in time but local regulations and/or union rules.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsj5777

50,"Beautiful to look at, Wonderful to listen to","The architecture is visually exciting but I wonder how totally functional it can be. There are free self guided tours between 10 AM and 2 PM. I went to a performance to see if the acoustics were fabulous but to be honest I couldn't tell. It was however, intimate. Combined with a trip to the Broad Museum, it was a great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annkD2707TQ
40,Love the building,"We had 1 day in Los Angeles and I wanted to see the concert hall. We arrived on a Saturday morning and found parking across the street. We just took pictures of the outside, that's all we had time for on our quick day trip to LA.It's a gorgeous building and great for photographers. Some day I'd like to go to a concert there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencX5901KK
40,it was a great experience!,"i took my son to see an aquanauts play and it was fantastic!!! we had so much fun and we did not have to make any extra purchases to be included, or participate in what was going on... he had a blast, the only reason i didn't give it the full 5-stars is because we had to move seats twice because we could not hear what was going on... the sound was off and made it difficult during the first half to follow along, but once i finally got tired of it i asked the clerk and he immediately took care of us! fantastic service, but again this rating is for the establishment as a whole and had the show been sold out we would have had an entirely different issue...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milvetmac
50,I am a subscriber.,"I love this hall. The interior design is a constant source of joy and inspiration. This is the home of the LA Philharmonic which is thriving under Dudamel's splendid direction. The acoustics are suburb! We have sat in 5th row center orchestra and 3 rows from the back wall in the uppermost balcony - The sound was brilliant and natural in both locations. The staff is proud of their hall and happy to assist you. The cafeteria food is excellent and fairly priced. Go early to hear a lecture/discussion relevant to the program the phil is about to play(not all performances, check ahead). I would give 6 stars if I could - a joy to experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2587VOstevenm
50,One of the world's great music halls,"First let me say that we visit the hall frequently. We have season tickets to the LA Phil and the LA Master Chorale. The hall itself is stunning, and the layout is very easy to navigate. Acoustics are some of the best I've experienced in any city. (Our seats are in Orchestra West) The only negative is that the food cafeteria is no so good. Easy to forgive. The hall is for music, not fine dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2131JNrobertd

The sound perfect; the location of the orchestra a stroke of genius.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9269JDmichaelh
50,An Acoustic Masterstroke,"This is a review for the concert going experience and after two concerts I must say it is a truly world class venue! Parking was pretty cheap ($9) and easily accessible since you find yourself right inside the building itself. The lobby is very labyrinthine and maze-like which leads you into the main theater which is truly breathtaking! The arrangement of the seats is like a compromise between traditional concert halls with most of the seats being in front of the orchestra and the vineyard style where the seats are terraced and surround the orchestra (similar to Berliner Philharmonie). I've heard much about the acoustics and after seeing shows from both the very back and right in front of the orchestra I can confirm that they are fantastic, every note sounds crisp and polished and I can hear every cough, paper ruffling, thud, and clearing of throat throughout the room (not that I wanted to hear those last four, but that's beside the point). Gustavo Dudamel is an amazing conductor and the entire orchestra was unbelievable. It was a magical experience and Frank Gehry should be proud of this great achievement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
40,Fabulous Architecture,"From the exterior and from several interior vantage points, this Frank Gehry-designed building is stunning. Unfortunately, you typically do not get to see the concert hall itself when you take a tour of the building - they show a video. But there is still much to see and enjoy, both inside and out. The tour is free, but they ask you to sign in at 2 PM.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertwD7057IG
30,Beautiful,"This Gehry building is indeed beautiful. If you want a l-o-n-g audio documentary, please take advantage of the audio tour equipment (free). I would have appreciated something less (more concise) than the audio tour in writing. The map was not helpful in this regard.We were VERY disappointed not to be able to see inside the auditorium. The signs say that these are not included, but some accommodation should be made (as in other venues) to have some access to this space.One last bit: the parking in the Disney is validated for tour goers (thank you), but since this is a unattended parking facility why the scarcity of machines to pay? As far as I could tell, in this huge complex, there were machines on two of the 7 parking levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesmD3016MY

50,Genius,"Well, its nice to retain a critical edge, finding that higher ledge where you can feel bit superior... but then when you're faced with the work of real genius - Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall - well, I am humbled. I know Gehry's long history of work which took quite a bit of development... often his earlier buildings were cricked for water leaking joints, construction materials coming loose, or idiosyncratic experiments. To walk through this building was an amazing experience. I had met another architect who had worked in his office just before this commission came out... the economy was in recession and Frank's office was teetering. Then this project came along. The individual architectural thoughts here, the expressive wholes, the coherence of the this wild ensemble is simply true greatness. I was in awe wandering around here. It's architect heaven for sure. PS, admission that day was free, which was dandy as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
50,Excellent acoustics and amazing design,"I have fallen in love with this place. Though I admittedly do not go to LA much I have made this place an exception. The design of this concert hall is incredible and the acoustics are outstanding. If you do go I recommend sitting on the side that is, either orchestra east or west. This way you get a very good overall view of the entire orchestra and can see the conductor's face. The seats themselves are comfortable and unlike some places I have been in, the seats do not feel crammed together. I cannot imagine anyone not liking the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cloust

50,Wonderful design and acoustics,"During our trip to Los Angeles last summer we had the great pleasure to attend a concert at this wonderful hall. We've been to numerous concerts in several concerts halls in the United States and in Europe. The acoustics of Disney Hall are second to none. You can hear so much detail and the sound is so rich and resonates even more with the huge amounts of wood in the hall. If you love good music, make sure you attend a concert at Disney Hall. The hall itself is really beautiful inside and out. Well worth a visit just to look at it. Inside it is all lovely golden wood, even the speaker boxes are paneled in it.

We were left tickets at will call and without that I'm not sure I would've have gone there for a concert. We were at USC from out of state for a college visit. The LA Phil produces a great sound and the building does not let down the philharmonic. The parking was easy as it's right under the building. All of the staff were friendly and courteous.

50,Extraordinary Building,"I'm trying to tick off Frank Gehry buildings when I have the opportunity - have previously been to the Guggenheim in Bilbao and the Marques de Riscal in Rioja - so it was great to see this amazing concert hall in Los Angeles. There is an organic beauty to this style which sits in stark contrast to the usual downtown boxes of steel and glass. The Guggenheim in Bilbao is said to have revitalised this dying port town, and the Marques de Riscal winery hotel in Rioja is an extraordinary sight in the tiny, ancient village of Elciego.Whenever I see these magnificent buildings I am always reminded of the Sydney Opera House - a building, designed in the 1950s, of which Gehry himself said ""Utzon made a building well ahead of its time, far ahead of available technology... a building that changed the image of an entire country.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CIHTravels

The venue also attracts world-famous soloists such as Joshua Bell (violin) or Hillary Hahn (piano). The acoustics are outstanding in this Frank Gehry-designed hall, and there are no pillars to obscure your view of the orchestra. There is not a bad seat in the house.

At one point he left the organ on the floor and played a piece on the other organ nestled in the pipes. Honestly I couldn't tell the difference but then again I'm nut the organ enthusiast. It was amazing to watch his hands and feet fly in 100 different directions and to actually hear music come from all that flailing.Stupidity I thought a few Disney tunes would be played or at least a Disney toy in the gift shop for my granddaughter.

If time allows there are many other places of interest within walking distance, ie: MOCA, Ahmansens Theatre, The Music Center, Angels Flight, Central Market, Union Station, The Biltmore Hotel (check out their swimming pool!), Olvera Street, Phillipe's the Original, famous for their French Dip Sandwiches. Park your car at the Disney Hall for $9 and spend the day exploring this area. Lots of places to eat, drink and people watch. The DASH buses will take you all over the area if one is not up to walking. Try it, it's a great way to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spikeandchopper
40,Swirly Stainless Steel,"Looks are free outside. Inside maybe the reputation was oversold - or I'm too uneducated to appreciate the acoustics - if something was special. The music pretty much sounded like ...music. But daaaang, that architectural stainless, what an architectural specimen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoePennington
40,Unique Building,"It has several nice features, for being outdated.It would be amazing to see this facility revised and updated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4288XBdavep
50,Stunning architecture by Frank Gehry,This place was on our list ‘must visit’ and it is really stunning - inside and outside. Unfortunately we did not take the guided tour but you can do self guided tour which is great. The building consists of several curved metallic surfaces reminiscent of a ship. There is a contrast in the materials used inside (wood radiating the warmth) and outside (metal evoking a cold feel). Originally the metal was reflecting too much light and heat so that it had to be treated to reduce the shine. If you have time try to get ticket for a concert as acoustics are fantastic.A must see place in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poplarkins
50,The best acoustics ever,"Even though it looke funky from the outside, the actual auditorium is pretty small and cozy with awesome acoustics. Have been there a few times and couldn't be happier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamS967
50,Wonderful acoustics,"Looks are transitory, but the experience of hearing a concert ( orchestral or Master Chorale) will stay with you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobFromTarzana
50,"This a must see, and should hear if you can","The Walt Disney Concert Hall is an architectural gem designed by Frank Geary and sitting on Grand Avenue with several of our other cultural icons surrounding it. It has to be seen both inside and out. Curved metallic surfaces reminiscent of a ship, curved surfaces throughout the interior, a public park on the terrace level accessible by a staircase from Grand Avenue, the Disney Concert Hall is a marvelous public space. There is a modest café inside, open to the public when there are concerts. I believe there are also tours available. To really experience the Disney, however, you should probably try to attend a concert. The acoustics are fabulous, the interior design very interesting, the organ is not only a piece of art but it is one of the best organs in the world.This is definitely a Los Angeles must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec
40,Attractive architecture,This is situated at Grand avenue close to the city hall walking distance to Union Station Metro. We couldn't go in to the building but had a good view. The architectural design is different and impressive. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aadhes

50,A Masterpiece of Contemporary Architecture and a World Icon,"This is a breathtaking landmark and people come from all over the world to see this as indicated by everyone taking pictures of it around the intersection. You can actually climb around the outside of the structure which takes you around the back to this beautiful hidden garden and back out to the front. I have never seen a show here before (and didn't see one today since it was closed) but once I do I will definitely update my review to talk about the concert-going experience as well. Even if you aren't seeing a show here, I highly recommend exploring around it and going into the garden, as the outside is open to the public unless there's a private event. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This is an international icon and a masterpiece of contemporary architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014

40,Tranquil Self-guided Garden Tour,It is so relaxing to do a self-guided garden tour behind the Hall and chatting with your friends there besides having a close look at the outside of the Hall. I impressed my Taiwanese visitors by exploring this small garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR

50,Art and Beauty Inside and Out,I've had the joy of DJing the Los Angles Food and Wine Festival as they blocked the street in front of this beautiful building. I loved gazing on this structure as the sun set. The architecture alone is nothing less than breathtaking. Go inside to witness the music and you are in heaven. Great acoustics and music on an orchestral level. I love this place. Eat before you go. There are not a lot of good places in walking distance. You won't regret it the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
40,"Beautiful Buidling, Great Music!","The Building itself is a must see and the Music offered is wonderful!Getting to the Concert Hall is HORRIBLE by freeway and parking lots are designed to confuse!There is a Cafe located inside the Concert Hall, it is small with limited seating and high priced limited menu.Employees are friendly and helpful!Restrooms are neat and clean, but limited space makes for long waits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronbR7652TH
30,Interesting for a building,"The Walt Disney Concert hall is near the Broad and the MOCA. On the weekend, we parked on a Sunday for $9 for the day. We wanted to take the 10 am tour but it was cancelled. We took the 11 o'clock tour but it was very crowded. A lot of people were turned away. We did not get to see the actual inside of the hall, just a video. The place is a little strange - it looks like tree trunks cut off. They emphasized that there was an organ.There was a lot of misinformation given about the surrounding services. To clear it up - the MOCA costs $15 not $12. Tickets sold 2 hours before the performance are discounted for seniors or students, not for other people. Anyone else has to pay the standard price.I suggest that you eat before you attend the performance. A cheese plate with a few pieces of cheese and a handful of grapes was $12 and a sandwich with four bites was $10. Drinks were $15.If you want to take the tour, arrive early.There is not a lot to see on the outside of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
50,Unusually Welcoming Tour,This Hall is open to all on purpose and has a great self guided audio tour. It explains how it all came about as well as the architecture and design. WD's widow wanted a feelling of a rose covered small church and this was the happily accepted result.Go see for yourself how this apparent contradiction is resolved!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getitright212
50,Another side to Walt Disney !,I was fascinated to hear all about the Disney Family vision for the concert hall.Take the tour at 12.30 its free ( though sign up at least 20 minutes in advance )If you can't use the free head phones guided tour also good.Have fun .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolWatt
50,Amazing architecture and great place for music,"I have been there several times over the years to listen to classical music.The sound quality is amazing and you can be really close to the orchestra.Food choices are pretty good: a restaurant on the expensive side and a cafeteria with a reasonable choice of hot and cold plates.You should take the time to circle around and look at the building because pictures don't fully convey its grace.Easily accessible via the Metro (Red Line), buses and not too far from Union Station (another great building!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericv178
50,A Unique Concert Hall,"Wonderful Gehry building with different outside gardens and other nooks to find inside the hall. Have been wanting to visit the hall for a performance for years and finally got the chance with a summer chamber orchestra. The acoustics are great, even from the seats in back of the ensemble where we sat under the concert hall organ. All of the sight lines appear unobstructed, although some of the seating in the nose-bleed areas appear quite distant. Must return someday to hear a performance from the LA Phil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ciaran11
50,A Must See Stop,"Obviously if you can stop by for a performance that would be ideal, but simply walking around the Hall is breathtaking.The original metal finish actually blinded nearby residents, that should give you some indication to the architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zapprint
50,"If you miss the music, go for the building.","There is a free guided tour over the building. Very, very worth. You will spend a couple of hours learning about the process of design+build the place.Great to take kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vwarwar
30,Tight tight seating,The Concert Hall was designed for those under 6 feet tall. Seating is very uncomfortable. My wife and I go only if the performances are something we can not see anyplace else. Accoustics are good,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dean01
50,A Frank Gehry delight.,In one respect this is not as good as the Guggenheim Bilbao - it is not as easy to photograph it from different angles and in different lighting conditions. However it is possible to walk around the inner walls - do not miss this - there are steps (and an accessible lift) to walk around a path and small park area with seats. It was so quiet and peaceful after a brilliant visit to the Broad gallery next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueKeo
50,Another gehry wonder,"Architecturally it is a beautiful opera hall, very much of frank gehry style and similar to the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao! Even if you can't get tickets for inside it is a nice place to walk around for free! There is a nice garden on top with an amphiteatre and ceramic structures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler

50,A must-see,Disney Hall is a breathtakingly beautiful venue that could probably make mediocre music sound wonderful. The seating is somewhat non-traditional and my favorite place is high up in one of the gallery seats where you look down on the performance and orchestra guests. The acoustics are near perfect. Love the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/760AndreaG
30,Crazy Architecture,"The view from the street is jarring. This is crazy architecture and does not appeal to me, but it does catch the eye. Not sure how functional it is. Does not add to the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451

40,Very Beautiful Inside & Outside,"Home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Disney Concert Hall is a stunning piece of architecture. Surprisingly the materials used inside & outside are completely different with the outside having a ""cold"" metal look while the inside auditorium has the effect of ""warm"" wood. I believe this amazing bold architecture can only be found by the same architect in Bilboa, Spain. Note that there are very small ""pocket parks"" around the building. Fun trivia: originally the outside metal reflected so much blinding light & heat that the entire building had to be ""brushed"" to reduce the shine! Walk to the nearby Music Center to see the fountain where water disappears into the concrete!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016

50,Wow!,"We were staying not too far from the hall and walked to see it after dinner our first night in DTLA. Having visited the Gehry Guttenberg Museum in Bilboa, Spain, it was a must see for me.

50,Beautiful,"We didn't go in the concert hall but drove by it. The architecture, thanks to Frank Gehry, was really neat and fairly iconic. I was glad we detoured to see it and take a photo, but without Los Angeles Philharmonic tickets, I didn't feel the need to go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pingin505

50,"Get in, if you can.","Sometimes a stunning building can disappoint when it comes to experiencing a performance inside. Unlike the Sydney Opera House, in my city of Sydney, the Walt Disney Concert Hall surpasses any expectations from the outside in. We visit Los Angeles often and watched as the titanium panels were lifted into place on this stunning building. We have since seen a variety of performances there and each time we are bowled over by the beauty of the wooden fittings, the acoustics and the service areas within. One slight drawback is the number of season ticket holders who merely turn up regardless of who or what may be on stage. This reduces the number of seats available for visitors to Los Angeles who may only have a few days to chase a ticket or two. It is a cultural highlight in this city which is supposed to be an intellectual desert. Sheer beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grantmccahon
50,Unbelievable architecture outside and inside,"Attended the opera ""Young Caesar"" June 13, 2017. Amazing visual and audio experience. Unique use of the space. A stimulating evening that I would love to repeat. The LA Phil. New Music Group was actually made the center of performance with unusual instruments. The singers, dancers, illustrations, film, and puppets moves around them. My first experience in this venue and I loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEA830

50,A Frank Gehry Dazzler,"Some day I will attend a performance inside, but in the meantime, I am just thrilled to come gaze upon the structure. It's beautiful. I wish I knew about it before a long journey in Spain to see the 'cousin' building in Bilbao (the Guggenheim). I don't regret visiting the latter, but as a northern Californian it would have been a lot easier to visit the Los Angeles masterpiece, but I didn't know about it until after the trip to Bilbao!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MtWhitney07

As seen from the outside it looks like it will be dark inside until you walk inside and see all of the natural light coming into the building. frank gehry is an amazing architect, and this building really stands out against the sunny california sky and contrasts beautifully, Well worth the stop and walking through the building exploring all the nooks and crannies. While did not have time to see a show, i think it would be amazing to see an orchestra perform inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7823URdanh

50,Last concert of the 2016/2107 season...,"As a subscriber it is always sad to know that I will have to wait a few months until the 2017/2018 begins. But looking back at the 18 performances I attended, there are some great memories to be had from this tremendous orchestra and the beautiful Walt Disney Hall. We do not often get to introduce someone to the excitement of a first visit to the Hall and their first LA PHIL performance. This past Sunday, yesterday we had the opportunity to do just this. And what a time it was. Gustavo Dudamel conducting, Stravinsky, Bartok and Janacek, with Yuja Wang as soloist. We had attended the concert the Sunday before, during her first of the two weeks here in Los Angeles. It was fantastic to listen and to watch her play. However, from our regular subscription seats we do not get a look at the hands while playing. We were so lucky two days prior to the concert, to add on these seats on the other side of the hall and to watch her hand movements. My God, my fingers do move like that; the speed, power, lightness, placement and precision was just thrilling to watch. As were her 2 encores that elicited more standing applause than I have ever seen here. The audience roared with the conclusion of each. We showed our guest the usual routine, an hours drive from Orange County, a light lunch at the Patina Cafe within the hall, 1PM pre concert talk, UpBeat Live, pre order drinks for intermission, and settle into our seats and watch the people enter and be seated. Always amazing to see the clothing, from short pants and Hawaiian shirts, to suits and ties. Barely there dresses, to 1960's hippie style long skirts, no make up to way too much plastic surgery. But we all have in common the music and the love for the LAPHIL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citronjimmerz
50,Stunning architecture,Saw this from the outside only. Incredibly unique architecture with its metallic wavy folds. Took a peek inside and saw a concert hall much like Sydney Opera House's interior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganchowa
50,A visual and aural treat,"The Frank Gehry design sits atop a hill in downtown Los Angeles that has become the culture neighborhood of museums and performance halls. Disney Hall as it is colloquially known is home to the La Philharmonic which is worth a listen anywhere you find them. Music Director Gustavo Dudamel is a gift from Venezuela infinitely more valuable than the oil from his country. His innovative and energetic programs have opened eyes and ears in LA to repertoire that is often modern and drawn from not often heard pieces. There are plenty of traditional programs as well. Disney Hall doesn't have a bad seat in the house. Sight lines are better than in any other hall I know, and the acoustics are even throughout. Do not hesitate to go for the cheap seats in the 5th level where prices are affordable and sound is even better than in the orchestra. L.A. now has one of the great concert halls of the world, ask the musicians, they love it too. An on-site cafe and ample parking (not cheap) are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pherford
50,One of LA's newest icons. Not a bad seat in the house.,"I finally feel like I have visited the Walt Disney Concert Hall enough times that I can really write about it.The Disney Hall is an icon of Los Angeles for so many reasons. It is the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and plays host to a variety of musical performances from classical, jazz, and world musics. Artists include everyone from Björk to Bramwell Tovey. Frank Gehry's architecture features attention-grabbing curving and swirling metal and cool white stone on the outside, juxtaposed with colorful carpets and warm woods on the inside. There is a staircase on the north side of the building that leads to a sculpture garden that has a fine view of Bunker Hill, yet feels cozy and tucked away from the din of downtown.The WDCH offers free hour-long tours during most days, including guided tours for concert goers ahead of select performances. You can also take a self-guided tour with audio narration by actor John Lithgow.The auditorium is an acoustic marvel. Sound carries to every corner without echoes. The pipe organ in the center of the room draws your eye to it with its seemingly haphazard array of pipes (unless you are seated in the rear orchestra section, in which case, you should take some time before the show to admire the organ from a vantage point on the other side of the room). Though ticket sales warn of partially obstructed views, I have sat in these partial view sections, and did not find any obstructions. The auditorium itself is remarkably small (capacity holds 2265 people).The Los Angeles Philharmonic takes care to provide an excellent concert experience, so they take such things as audience punctuality and conduct very seriously. The lights in the lobby will flicker 5 minutes ahead of performance time. If you do not take your seat, the usher will not allow you to enter the auditorium until there is a suitable break in the performance. Photography is STRICTLY PROHIBITED during performances, though you are welcome to take pictures before and after the show. A friendly voice will remind you to silence your electronic devices. If you do not heed this warning and your mobile phone goes off, the usher will send you out if your fellow audience members haven't killed you first.While this is a fairly casual theatre compared to some concert halls, call me a snob, but I think it would behoove patrons to familiarize themselves with proper symphony etiquette ahead of time. It's not a black tie sort of place, but dress neatly and appropriately. Applaud the concertmaster and the conductor. Don't applaud between movements of a musical piece. Sticking to these rules will ensure a good experience for everyone in the audience (and not create unwanted distractions for performers).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GumdropGirl
50,Great Acoustic and Orchestra View from Rear Terrace Seats,"We booked the week before the concert when the best seats available to us were near the back of the Terrace. The acoustics, ambience and orchestra view from our seats were superb at this great concert with Yuja Wang, Dudamel and the Los Angeles Master Chorus. Not inexpensive, but excellent value and enjoyment. Also there is an excellent restaurant, Au Lac, and coffee shop, Prime Grind, right across the street (West 1st Street).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerfN
50,Not to be mussed,"I have lived in LA for most of my life and have been a subscriber to the LA Philharmonic for many years. Disney Hall is spectacular, inside and out. The building represents Frank Gehry at his very best. The interior is stunning - the woodwork is spectacular, the acoustics are near perfect and the LA Philharmonic is among the world's top symphony orchestras. While the price for seats is on the high side, I would suggest that a visitor treat themselves and spend an evening of fine music and beautiful surroundings at Disney Hall",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPG625

You won't be satisfied with lesser halls after you have been here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Local1943
50,Great music in a glorious setting,"This concert hall designed by Frank Gehry is a magnificent venue to hear classical music. We had the opportunity to hear Gustavo Dudamel conduct the LA Phil here, and it was a soul satisfying experience. A superb experience and worth making a trip through the messy LAX airport !Put this one on your Bucket List",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yatriguru
40,Very special,"I would say it's a very special place if you admire music, architecture or just want to find something different in LA! I also believe it's one of the most photographed spots of DTLA (best time would be a sunset if you want to snap a great shot). Place has same intriguing character inside as it's looks from outside. Great acoustics and great visibility from almost any seat. Couple of small bars inside have simple refreshments and snacks but I wouldn't count on having something substantial or special inside, besides there are plenty great restaurants around (like Otium for me). Parking is a breeze!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinaLACA
30,Cool architecture,"Cool to see, and the shop is great for music fans, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. If there's a concert, then it would be a cool place to be. They also offer tours, but I didn't get the chance to take one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
40,Superb Design!,This was one of the activities I wanted to do and I loved it! The design is very futuristic but the curves and shape makes it feel like a masterpiece. If in LA I would definitely recommend this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eloygm
50,Breathtakingly beautiful,"All the other reviewers have covered many facets of this incredibly designed concert hall, from the architectural wonder of Gehry's creative talent to the impossibly perfect acoustics. This place is an opportunity to have your senses dazzled, including the exquisite interior design incorporating three different types of wood as well as the stunning organ. The attention to detail is beyond perfect. From Gustavo to Yo-Yo, it is a sensory explosion to be present for every performance. We are absolutely blessed to have LA Phil in our city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnitaNewportBch
50,Beautiful Gehry building,"Beautiful Frank Gehry building. Free tours are offered weekdays only earn there is not a concert. Check the weekday schedule so you won't be disappointed. If it's sunny out, the metal sides heat up the surrounding areas at least 10-15 degrees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
50,Concert by the LA philharmonic- I am speechless!!!,"The concert hall is such an architectural masterpiece. Beautiful design. Modern, clean, wonderful staff. We had seats on the side upper rows and were able to look down on the orchestra which afforded us not only a great vision of the musicians playing, but also the sound was amazing. Gustavo Dudamel is a true treasure! We were thrilled to be able to experience this concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommal2014
50,Most amazing Gehry Architecture/ Outstanding Acoustics,"This building, inside and out, is a phenomenon! The Disney Company deserves wild applause for what they created in this space. If I lived nearby I'd have to just drag out a chair and sit and stare at it. The sun light changes the exterior. Inside, the orange walls glow and the skylights change color with the help of hidden lights (I'm guessing.) We were fortunate enough to see Yo Yo Ma, Edgar Myers and Peter Thile, all 3 musical child prodigies, perform Bach there. If that were not enough, we came back two days later to hear Gustavo Dudamel conduct the LA Symphony in Straus and Mahler pieces. Put this place and its world-class performers on your bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandoldgirlb
50,Awesome concert,The Yoyo Ma concert was music to our ears as the acoustics were just perfect. It was delight getting in and out of the venue. A great place for a concert,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregL280
50,There's a Dude in the House,"I don't claim to enjoy the classical music scene, yet when Gustavo Dudamet conductors the LA Philharmonic, you should listen. Under his energetic leadership the Orchestra reaches new heights. You will Not be disappointed in the musical program. The Walt Disney Concert Hall is without a doubt, world class. The acoustics were superb. Fans of Classical Music do not miss this scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackE430
50,One of a kind,Great place to see music. The design (by Frank Geary) is amazing and the sound perfect. Worth a tour if you can't see a concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
40,"Beautiful Concert Hall, Patina is in the same Building","The WDCH is a stunning piece of Art inside and out. I love coming here. Patina is in-building if you want to have a Splichal experience. The Broad is next door if you want Otium for dinner. Wander about and sense the architecture, attend a concert here if you like. The acoustics is very good, not excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolola
50,This is a feast for the eyes and the ears!,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics, comfortable seats, a fantastic organ, beautiful rooftop gardens, a fountain dedicated to Lillian Disney, a shop full of music related gifts for adults and children, and an aerial walkway around the top. If you are able to attend a concert here, absolutely do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bstorm
30,Cool architecture.,"If you have time over in LA, I suggest you to drive downtown and have a look at Walt Disney Concert Hall. It has a super architecture and you can get a lot of cool pictures there. And also it's free. I enjoyed it since we had a lot of time, but wouldn't say that it's a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeckaJohansson
40,Great architecture,The outside of the building appears amazingly cool and modern but within it are warm shades and has good use of lighting. Go on the free audio tour or if you prefer a personal touch to join the daily tours available at 1230pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natyip
50,Brilliantly designed building offers beauty inside and out,"Walt Disney Concert Hall is a national treasure. The acoustically perfect performance hall was designed by legendary architect Frank Gehry and opened in 2003, part of the beautiful Music Center complex which also includes the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Ahmanson Theater and Mark Taper Forum.of the Los Angeles Music Center and was designed by Frank Gehry. It is in a perfect location -- with pretty shops and restaurants nearby, and even if you are not going to a play or concert, you will enjoy strolling the grounds, having a cup of coffee or a beverage at one of the outdoor bars and eateries, enjoying the buskers (always talented) and arranging a tour of the building if there is not a concert. Gustavo Dudamel conducts the fabuous Los Angeles Philharmonic, a treat. Many world class orchestras also perform there. Don't miss it. And plan to stay at the fabulous Omni Hotel, right across the street. Fine fare there and often live music to continue your cultural immersion. We have posted many travel stories about this delightful part of town at whereiscookie.com.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whereiscookie
50,One of Gerhy's greatest.,"I live in near San Diego and I made it a point to visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall after moving here from Phoenix. During a recent trip to Los Angeles, I was able to fit it in to a Saturday morning. What a piece of art this building indeed is! I explored all sides and even spent a little time inside. Even if you're not attending an event at the concert hall - give it a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99skidevil
50,A must-see in L.A.,"Not only is Disney Hall an architectural marvel, the acoustics for concerts are superb. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMUni
50,An excellent venu for music.,My husband and I spent an evening at the Wat Disney Concert Hall listening to the LA Philharmonic Orchestra during the Reykjavik (Iceland) Festival. What a fabulous place for music! The acoustics are extraordinary and the building (exterior and interior) are worth a visit of itself. Kudos to the LA Philharmonic for thinking 'outside of the box' and bringing new music to a younger audience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irish_Harry
50,Great acoustics and fascinating architecture,The Disney Concert Hall has great acoustics. No matter where you sit you can see well and hear well.And the architecture is interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Mama66
50,About the Tickets,"Based on my personal experience, if you are planning to purchase ticket for a LA Phil concert, go to the LA Philharmonic website! Don't just search for 'Walt Disney Concert Hall tickets'!This is exactly what I did. I was lead to the Ticket Center website which appears no different than a normal ticket page and purchased two LA Phil tickets which are 3 times priced as on LA Philharmonic website! After I eventually figured out the trick I was so regret but no way to get refund. This is a trap especially for the tourists who are not familiar with the local concert but only know Walt Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28yunm
50,"Great acoustics and a gorgeous, innovative venue","The Disney Concert Hall is a must-experience site in DTLA. The acoustics are wonderful, and the entire building inside and out is aesthetically pleasing. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. Combine a concert here with one of my favorite DTLA restaurants, Baadmash, a wonderful contemporary Indian place. You can walk there easily from The Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,A breathtaking space for breathtaking music,"Frank Gehry's use of steel is well known, and Chicago and Bilboa claim similar structures to this one. But what makes Disney Hall unique is the variety of Japanese gardens that sprung all around the concert hall, accessible from the hallways. It is the most amazing feeling to go to a concert there, and walk out at intermission to the most serene and dramatic garden I have ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129sylvies
50,Walk around inside and out,"This is one of the few venues that you need to walk around, inside and out, to get the full effect. There are doors outside the second floor, and you can get a good view of the city looking outward, and a great view of the building's architecture, looking inward. you don't have to be a fan of architecture (perhaps you are a fan of music instead:--)) to enjoy a walkabout of this building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR
50,Love Frank Gehry,"Self guided tour is a great way to navigate the building and learn about the centre, & its free.The outdoor garden is a particular attraction, a picnic lunch here is perfection, Its disappointing you cannot get into the Auditorium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMANBRAD
40,Awesomearchitecture,Easy accessible and with fantastic shapes of the facades.The small garden and its mosaic fountain also looks nice.Short time visit when you are in the neigborhood. Don't drive hours to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steen123456789
50,Premium sound and concert experience,"Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of the premiere places to see a concert in Los Angeles. The venue was built for optimal sound and every seat is good.It's also a distraction-free venue. They don't allow cell phone use, photos, nor videos during the show, and people are only seated between songs and during intermission, so you can relax and get completely immersed in the night.I've seen Fiona Apple, Ben Harper, Sigur Ros, and more at WDCH - every show has been exceptional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyTravelTalesColette
50,Amazing Sound,"The Disney Concert Hall was built specifically for concerts, and I haven't been disappointed yet. I've attend a variety of performances here showcasing diverse musical styles, and every time it has been a pleasant experience. It truly has become one of my favorite venues in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine80312
40,Walt Disney Concert Hall,An absolutely beautiful building! We loved just looking at the architecture.Easiest is to drive around it to view as parking on the street wasn't really possible. That was you can get a lovely pic.Be warned lots of traffic though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me8ow
40,Great to See this Iconic Building in Real Life!,"As well as seeing the unusual exterior designed by Frank Gehry, you can take a self-guided tour of the interior (but not the auditorium, because there are often rehearsals occurring). The Nimbus art installation in the foyer – a cloud-like formation that changes colour and plays music – is mesmerising. The LA Phil Store has a stunning array of music-themed goodies on sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
50,What a Classical treat!,"I love the Disney Hall in the LA Music Center. Matinees are our favorite since the traffic and parking seem a bit easier.

50,"Beautiful Building, Marvelous Music","We have season tickets to hear the LA Symphony at Walt Disney Concert Hall. Always a great night out. The architecture is stunning, the concerts moving, the museum shop interesting, the cafe very convenient and reasonable. Can't go wrong.The tour of just the building is good too. I've taken relatives on that and they thoroughly enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthotelpatron
50,A Gehry Masterwork,"Downtown Los Angeles is starved of ground-breaking architecture...the kind that makes one stop and wonder, Who designed that and how is it built? The Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of those buildings, and here's your opportunity to get up close and personal with one of Frank Gehry's masterworks.Pritzker Prize-winner Gehry crumpled a piece a paper and conceived of a seemingly random structure, then engineered it to become a world class symphony hall. This kind of architectural conception doesn't happen everyday, so take time to appreciate this amazing building inside and out.The LA Music Center conducts FREE docent-guided tours on most days at 12 noon and 1:15 pm. Self-guided audio tours are from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm. Be sure to consult the tour schedule on The Music Center's website, because some days are blacked-out for tours. We opted for the docent-led tour which lasted one hour and was very comprehensive. The interior hall is closed to tours, but this chance to walk through nooks and crannies doesn't disappoint.This is a MUST for armchair architects and every Gehry fan. Park in the Disney Hall parking garage and have your parking ticket validated at the tour desk in the lobby. The discounted parking rate is $9.00 with validation, and again, the tours are FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonfromDallas
40,Gorgeous design that adds to the modern feeling of DTLA,"Beautiful building and center of culture a part of the Los Angeles Music Center. A must see for photos and, if there the symphony playing, it is well worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legacyLA
50,One of My Favorite LA Places!,"We go to the Disney for a concert series and it remains one of my most favorite places in Los Angeles. It is exquisite on the outside, especially in daylight, but also at night -- a true work of art. The concert hall itself is brilliantly designed, and the LA Philharmonic a joy to hear. Go go go if you're in L.A. (despite the only fair restaurant in a dingy corner of the first floor!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
40,Symphony Hall (UK) is better and cheaper,"We attended a Los Angeles Philharmonic concert and sat behind the orchestra, even so the acoustics were very good. We are fortunate to like near Birmingham (UK) and have access to the work leading Symphony Hall where you can get similar seats for half the price. We pre-ordered wine for the interval and were disappointed to be served poor wine in plastic cups (and it wasn't cheap either). This took the gloss off an otherwise good night out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaymiller
40,"Great sound, comfortable seating, ugly.","We have been there for 3 concerts; sound is terrific. Had great seats and cheap(ish) seats. All were good. Parking ample, but slow to exit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsflady

50,lovely venue,The main room of the Walt Disney concert hall is a lovely space - every seat in the house has a great view of the stage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allanbowers
50,A wonderful experience,"Even for a New Yorker and frequent Lincoln Center visitor, the Disney Center is a treat. Beautiful building, garden, options for walking and dining, all true, but the orchestra itself is amazing. We had seats behind the orchestra so we could watch the conductor-- a truly thrilling experience. Make this a stop and splurge on the tickets. Really, really, really worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imabroadwaybaby
50,Remarkable,A masterpiece of architecture and engineering! Frank O. Gehry and his works are incredible! You must see and touch this building!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaurisB1
50,Unforgettable,What a treat to be able to squeeze in a concert at the Disney. The Frank Gehry designed Hall never ceases to amaze me. LA is so fortunate to have this. Make sur3 you come early so you can walk around and visit the garden on the 3rd floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagnumPI808
50,Truly remarkable architecture and a well-conceived environment,"We have season tickets to the LA Philharmonic but we've been to the Disney Hall any number of times since it opened. There are several distinct possibilities when planning a visit.The most rudimentary is to walk the grounds and building. Frank Gehry's conception is truly remarkable and one gets a full appreciation by walking around the place. There is a garden and amphitheater in back as well as superb scenic views of downtown LA.The second experience would be to take in a concert. The LA Phil is one of the country's great orchestras and the sound within the auditorium is outstanding. We've sat in orchestra, orchestra east and terrace west seats and the sound is good in each section. However, the terrace sections are a bit narrow and my wife experienced a bit of vertigo getting to our row 1 seats. The viewing angle is a bit weird (high and to the side) but it can be advantageous for piano concerts. Terrace is quite reasonably priced for what you get.We prefer Orchestra East or West seats. We're close to the orchestra and having a view angle that is arguably better than orchestra (which is, of course, an excellent section).Also visit the gift shop, particularly if you're a musician or play a musical instrument. A very nice and different selection of merchandise from other gift shops.And for a special experience, have pre-concert dinner at Patina restaurant. Fine dining at a pinnacle.Building parking is ample. You can get to the Disney via the Metro. The stop is Civic Center, but it's a bit of an uphill walk.The Broad Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art, Music Center and Colburn School of Music are within a block and each is worth visiting. And the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is two blocks in the other direction but is a don't miss stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorrinw2016
50,Iconic,"A beautiful display of architecture and interior design. Amazing acoustics , best place to see an indoor concert in a large LA venue regardless of the genre. Seats in all price ranges , not a bad seat in the house ! A Gehry great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArleneD547
50,Unsurpassed,"This venue is one of the most beautiful and satisfying concert halls in the world . Architecturally it is stunning with curved surfaces everywhere that are mellowing, colors that are soft and inviting, There is a public garden accessible from both the street and from the concert hall . The acoustics are nearly perfect . The organ is a sight to behold. It is also honored by all of the world's organists that I have heard performing there . The current orchestra and its conductor, Gustav Dudamel are deservedly world famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3056KAalicec
50,Iconic Architecture,"Make this part of your walking tour of downtown Los Angeles. The building is by Los Angeles architect, Frank Gehry and is amazing to gaze at. You can walk around inside and take a tour or better yet, attend a concert here. The inside is all wood and so it presents the opposite of the exterior metal facade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyk220
50,Wonderful concert hall located in downtown Los Angeles,"Beautiful facility, excellent sound system, unusual decor.Whatever you go to see, the music fills the air and makes you feel a part of the event, easy access, handicap accessible,Have been there in several occasions.

50,Beautiful! Wonderful venue!,Beautiful venue! We went to a symphony. Nice acoustics and comfortable seats. Enjoyed the evening very much!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kb1kurt
50,Stunning.,"It IS an architectural landmark building, especially as a music concert hall. Although more impressive for a distance than up close, the real surprise is the hall itself. If you can get past the miss-guided choices for carpeting and seat covers, it is a stunning hall, visually and acoustically. My choice for best seat in the house? Behind the orchestra, so you're looking at the conductor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25kena
50,Amazing,"Originally, I went there to take some good pictures of the building's architecture after the Broad museum had a huge line in the front but ended up walking in and taking the free audio tour.The hall itself was impressive but going through the audio tour I appreciated it even more. The tour takes you through the building, back gardens and even on the roof (almost roof).It was one of the best experiences I had while visiting LA this time.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilly3851
40,Check out the back yard,"A must see building in LA, worth visiting. For architects it is iconic and they should visit the back yard to see also these views and the trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexiosVandoros
50,Still amazing,A classic piece of contemporary architecture that is still a wonder to behold. Great to be able to walk all over and get glimpses of intersecting and overlapping wings of metal. A glorious building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casuarina639
50,Acoustically perfect; marvellous architecture; $9 (cash only) parking after 5pm.,We attended a chamber music concert inside the main hall; you could hear a proverbial pin drop. A full orchestra sound would be wonderful to experience here. There is good access to the rows; the seats are comfortable and well-raked. Underground parking after 5 pm cost $9 cash.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb

50,Free self guided tour with subsidised parking,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a very interesting piece of architecture. This type of free self-guided tour is surely best practice.You can park underneath and they will reduce the rate because you did the tour. You pick up a small player with the recorded tour and follow the tour points around the building. You don't get to go into the main concert hall which is a little disappointing, however you move around the rest of the building quite freely. The tour is quite extensive and you end up quite high up in the building looking out over parts of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VHD001
50,Great place to hear top notch music in fabulous architecture.,"I love the architecture by Frank Gehry, and it's even nice to just walk around and bring a sandwich to the little garden area behind it, if you are in that area of downtown.They have some great events like old silent horror films accompanied by the enormous pipe organ, at Halloween. The symphony is first class but if the tickets are a bit out of your budget, you can see chamber music for a very reasonable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CobaltViolet

The tour is free! you just have to pay for parking (6$).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinlN7675RJ
40,Fabulous venue! Now help me find my seat.,"Incredible acoustics, so many beautiful architectural things to look at while you enjoy the concert. My husband and I have enjoyed this venue many times. If you are afraid of heights or are claustrophobic don't sit in the higher-raked seats. They are steep and narrow hallways are a worry in case of emergency. Also, in the higher raked seats, be aware the inefficient doors on the restrooms - intermission is short, people should safely and quickly be able to negotiate that issue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendor818

50,A breathtaking architectural wonder,The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a unique space in which to enjoy music concerts.

50,Great Visit,"Four of us recently took the self-guided tour of Walt Disney Concert Hall. The space is absolutely beautiful and the self-guided tour was very informative.

50,Have visited LA many times and 1st time being here,This place is gorgeous! Walking around the exterior gives you some incredible photo opportunities. Just incredible architecture. We were here in February so the reflection from the sun felt great but I'm sure in August it is killer!! You can also go inside and watch a video and explore the interior for free. Next time in LA I will definately get tickets to see a concert. The acoustics must be amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbythec

30,The architecture of the building,"one of the interesting buldings to watch. Unless you plan ahead and book a show, you wounld feel the true essense of the accoustics.

50,stunning building,We went to hear Gustavo Dudamel conduct the Russian romantics one evening and then heard Handels Messiah another night. Both experiences were fantastic. The acoustics here make no seat a poor choice. The outdoor garden is delightful as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100SusanM
50,Expecting the unexpected,"From the exterior, this wonderful structure (which to me always looked like a ship, but I have been told was meant by the architect to resemble a rose) seems like it should house only the most modern of music performances. But one of the best kept secrets is how phenomenal the sound is for any kind of performance, regardless of where one is seated in the house. The soft wooden interior makes listening comfortable and outs the focus where it belongs, on the music. Yet the size and seating arrangement create an intimacy rare in concert halls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebekah_jorgensen
50,Stunning Design,"Located right next the The Broad, just walk a couple extra meters and take a look at this architectural masterpiece!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adroso360

30,OK food in a dark cavern.,"Before a concert, we visit a cafeteria like dining room athr Disney Concert Hall. We feel the food is over priced and, while professionally prepared (by Patina) it lacks sizzel. A salad bar the never changes, nice soups. The people are nice but something is missing. Then lets talk about the actual dining room. Dark, depressing. Built when the money ran out.Management should really do something to improves this experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voxpopla
40,Superb concert venue,We caught the Nutcracker here and we very much enjoyed the show. The venue itself is superb. The acoustics were more than satisfactory and even the worst seats have a good view of the stage. The architecture is impressive. All in all definitely one of the things to take and if you are in or living in Los Angeles. One thing to note is that seeing a concert here is not cheap. This is not the Hollywood Bowl. . But there are limited numbers of cheap seats available but you probably have to book weeks and possibly months in advance to get them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
40,Great venue but the seats are small,I saw Kraftwerk there several years ago and Disney Hall is a beautiful venue and the sound was terrific but the seating is cramped and hard to deal with for hours at a time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adriandN1379ZP

50,DATE NIGHT,One of my favorite LA date night venues. Always inspiring and memorable. I have seen incredible performances at The Disney Hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888contact
50,Beautiful concert hall,"The WDCH is a beautiful concert hall, in every aspect. The architecture of the building (outside) is pretty striking; and, the concert hall itself is really nice. The acoustics are great, so going to a concert is a treat, for sure. I'm not in love with the tapestry of the seats (a bit too calypso for my taste, hahaha), but that's just esthetics ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yayras
50,Great concert and dinner.,"I frequently attend concerts here. Usually very good programing and good parking, (leave plenty of time) Many places to eat close by. The acoustics in the hall are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonViolin
50,unique building,"This building looks better in person than in pictures, and it's already beautiful in photos. We parked nearby, paid $8 for the whole day. Admission and self guided tour is free. To watch a concert you have to get tickets. People were rehearsing, but you are not allowed in that area. It has a nice store and good but pricey cafe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariagovea18
50,For a music lover this is heaven!,"let me say I have never heard any better acoustics in my life, the bass sounds so clean. The instruments are well mastered, the treble, vibratos of guitars, the drums the violin ohhhhhh I get chills only remembering how beautiful everything was orchestraded. I will be going back. No doupt in the world",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lidiakinsley
50,Wonderful experience!!,The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a wonderful piece of architecture unlike most of what we see in the United States. It is a marvel during the day but positively breathtaking view at night. From the outside you cannot imagine the space it contains but I found the public areas spacious and interesting. The Hall is colorful and modern and the acoustics are superb. My travel companions and I sat in the Terrace seating and felt as though the Philharmonic was playing just for us. I agree it is a must see and visit when in LA. We plan to go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clintonlcarbon

50,A must visit!,"Exquisite! What a wonderful Music Hall it is! The architecture, the interior design, pure class, beauty and functionality. The acoustics are wonderful and the feel very intimate despite the hall being quite large. They always have excellent music choices, so everyone can find something they like. It's nice to come out for an afternoon and see the show and go to either lunch or dinner at one of the near by restaurants. Our Downtown is really shaping up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAVict0ria
50,Amazing Experience,We say Handel's Messiah here and the building is beautiful inside and out. Highly recommend it for classical music fans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
50,Architectural Marvel!,"A beautiful uniquely crafted building set in downtown LA, this place is worth a visit just to take in the architecture. The interior hall is just as impressive as the exterior. We attended a concert there to see the LA Philharmonic live. If you plan to see a concert there, parking is available in the attached garage for around $10 (must be out by midnight). Otherwise you can search around downtown to park elsewhere. We found it best to be parked at the venue since it would be late once the concert ended.I believe there are tours available at limited times for the actual building and tickets are available online. Since we attended a concert there, we did not opt for the actual tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4GTravels
50,"Even without a ticket, a memorable visit","Full frontal disclosure: I am an Architect.This structure is unquestionably one of the architectural marvels of the West Coast. The process of design and construction are so interesting that a docent led tour of the building, available without waiting most days, is nearly as entertaining as an actual concert - and cheap, too.The tour will take you up and down stairs to look at details of the structure that the architecturally inclined will find fascinating. The stories of the dramatic and improbable road to construction (Mrs. Disney hated the design and threatened to pull out) contrast with the exquisite intricacy, detailing and finish of the building.You will NOT get to visit the inside of the main concert hall, as most days it is either in performance or rehearsal or some other technical function. But the rest of the spaces, stairs, terraces and lobbies still provide a very informative tour. It's good cheap entertainment, and if you are smitten, you can then buy a ticket for one of the many upcoming performances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8826GWpeters
20,Tour not available on rainy days,We checked online before going to the concert hall and it said the tours were still going on. We made it all the way downtown and were told that the tours have been canceled because of the rain. The architecture of the building and the public gardens outside were nice. It was too bad that the tour was cancelled because of the rain so we didn't get to see the concert hall at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14emilyr
50,Modern statement,"Walt Disney Hall is a treat to view and attend. It is elegantly modern and invites you in and around it. Don't miss the outside stairs leading to a secluded retreat.

50,Wonderful Concert Hall,"Can't say enough how much I love this concert hall. Every seat in the house is good. Sound is amazing. And the atmosphere is gorgeous. I've seen all kinds of shows and artists here. Christmas programs, Brian Wilson, Liza Minnelli, Chaka Khan...the list goes on and on. I love coming here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/566KarenP
40,Concert for the ears and eyes,"This hall is exquisite for its tonal balance, its physical beauty and the wonderful presentations. A visit is a must. Arrive early and attend the seminars usually presented before most performances. The information is generally beautifully presented and It is well worth hearing for aditional enjoyment of the evenings presentation. Location, location, location, going downtown offers a variety of opportunities that are nearby. Parking is easy and the elevators take you right into the hall, so wheather isn't a concern. Sound is exceptional from every location, and I've been seated in the far back, the front, the sides and in between. While the sound is excellent and the building warm and beautiful, long legged people might find the seating a bit cramped come intermission.Food and drink are available in the lobby and the Museum store is worth a look or two. If you keep your eyes sharp, you're likely to see some of the city's elite. Take time to visit the gardens and if you're in town for some time, take a look at the event calendar. When you're ready to leave the building, don't forget to take some photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisar593
50,Amazing venue!,"We have traveled to many famous music venues of the world. Disney concert hall is pretty much in our backyard, yet we never seemed to make it to a concert there. LA is a challenging driving environment when you come from more rural surroundings. But it was with every moment getting there!The architecture is jaw dropping both inside and out. We were privileged to see Zubin Metha and Anoshka Shankhar perform. It was spectacular from start to finish! This is a must see while in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gdr23
50,More incredible then you can imagine,"I expected the Walt Disney Concert Hall is be really great - and it exceeded my expectations. The Concert Hall is beautiful, beyond first class and has the most amazing acoustics one can imagine. It doesn't matter much what you are about to see - just being in the Concert Hall makes it better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardt707
50,Stunning architecture and acoustics,"We walked around the outside of this fabulous building designed by Frank Gehry to capture the many varied views from different angles. It glistened in the sunlight one day, was more subdued on a cloudy day, but breathtaking whatever the weather. Inside is also wonderful, especially the concert hall itself, which is visually beautiful and unusual and acoustically excellent. As New Yorkers who are accustomed to hearing the great NY Philharmonic play in an acoustically inferior hall, we were thrilled to hear how music can sound when the acoustics are really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dobbstraveler
50,Beautiful Architecture and Music Combine,A wonderful place to see beautiful architecture and listen to incredible music. The acoustics are phenomenal. There is not a bad seat in the house.

40,Great architecture but not much else,"Good to spend an hour or so here just to admire the architecture. Go to the top from its outside, and find a nice garden. It requires some effort to get here as it is located on top of a hill, hence you have to hike a little bit to get here on foot. Best to catch transport to reach here.No concerts are available during the xmas break period, so it was pretty quiet and we are limited to just exploring the building. There is a nice garden at the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntonN916
50,The Walt Disney concert Hall,"The Walt Disney concert HallAs I was driving to downtown Los Angeles on July 5, 2016 we passed by the Walt Disney concert Hall. I just can't believe the architecture of the building. It is like gigantic steel plates that are being thrown by the wind. Well it was designed like that. It looked as if the building was made out of metal well it was. It was designed by a famed international architect who made an architectural jewel like no other. I think this concert hall should have more concerts and more events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri

We had a memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrisrosie

50,Music or viewing,"Whether you come for a concert or just to see the sight, you'll have a lovely experience. Only drawback is the steep cost of parking. Love the acoustics, the building has a self guided tour that is well worth taking if you have time to spare during the day. Make sure you walk both out and inside for best experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthC78
50,"Wow, lots of angles.","I did a walkaround outside, and a brief walk thru the inside. The outdside is a photographers dream, so many angles and intersting spots to shoot. Find the outside stairs, great views from above and unique places for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnow39
50,Take your stair climbing shoes,"Honestly, this building is the most fun when you walk on it. There are stairs everywhere offering a new and neat view of the building and the city.

30,Outside Outstanding; Inside Uncomfortable,"We've loved the exterior of the hall and wanted to see the interior. So, on a trip to LA we got tickets to a symphony performance on November 26th. The 'Mezzanine' tickets were $224 for 2. Inside the hall is so different than the outside that it looks like two different buildings. No continuity. As an architect I was very disappointed. The real problem were our seats. I am handicapped (use a cane) but normal size (5'10''; 180 lbs). There was not enough leg room. I was in agony throughout the second half of an exceptionally great program. So here's the warning. Make sure you seat allows your feet to fit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimFHouston

40,Free tour in downtown LA,"If you've never been to this hall, it is worth an hour of your time to take a free tour. It's a unique space designed by Frank Gehry.

Even so, there is a lot to see and admire about this beautiful contemporary building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MumaRules

50,The building is superb!,"This architectural masterpiece designed by Frank Gehry is still as magnificent today as it was 13 years ago when the building first opened. The home of the LA Philharmonic, it's worth the price of admission to go to a concert, hear the amazing acoustics and just walk around.The Walt Disney Concert Hall now serves as a focal point for all sorts of cultural opportunities on what is now affectionately labeled ""Culture Hill"". The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion which houses the LA Opera is right next door and on the other side of the building is new Broad Museum of Contemporary art.There's plenty of convenient, albeit expensive parking nearby, but for just a quarter, you can board a DASH Transit bus which stops practically in front of the building.Even if you don't have time to go inside, this magnificently designed building is worth viewing just from the outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724JimB724
50,Great Atmosphere,"Beautiful design and architectural components inside out! Easy access, planty of parking ($9 for the night). It's better to eat beforehand (my choice would be the Otium in 5 min walking distance - reservation will save time) since they have a few bars throughout the hall, where drinks are more inviting than food/snack options. My only recommendation, if you are coming to a performance give yourself lots of extra time to explore the building from outside and inside - it's beautiful! Good sound and vibe! Anything in terrace level is a bit too far, but it's very personal. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248marinak
50,"Modern building, good place for great picture","This place is right across the street of The Broad, very modern building, the day I was there was a cloudy day, which was rare in Los Angles.

40,"fantastic Structure, unfriendly people","If you just consider the building this is a spectacular place.But, if you for example go to take a photo, and you are a little bit serious about quality and you take a tripod, they will chase you away, call you a professional, and tell you a permit is necessary.. geez. and no, they were not nice about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdBannister
50,Beautiful Achitecture,Walt Disney Concert Hall features a truly artistic exterior by the world renowned architect Frank Gehry. The interior feels a bit dated but the audio tour offers lots of interesting information on the history of the place and gives insights on the personality of Mr. Walt Disney. We have not had the chance to attend a performance in the concert hall so cannot give a review of the acoustics. There was a practice at the time of our visit and the concert halls were closed to the public.Definitely a place worth visiting in Downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eat1226

40,Review for the tour only,"First of all it’s free, so if you are planning on being downtown, check the website for the schedule and you may be able to take advantage of the tour. We went on a Sunday morning and we were the only two people on the guided tour. Our guide was very knowledgeable. Since the performers are often using the hall for practice, the tour does not usually include the inside of the hall where the performances actually take place. We were fortunate enough to go inside since it was empty, and our group was small. Although that was the highlight, I would have enjoyed the tour anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianew166
50,Great Architecture and Technology to witness,"Unfortunately, we could not plan our trip to listen to the great acoustics. But this place is a must visit place to understand the design details to make it a perfect place to enjoy orchestra. One must be willing to spend at least 30-40 minutes to either take a guided tour or take audio guide. Good place for photography. Guided tours take about 1 hour or more and start at 10.15 am and 12.30 pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Royadip
50,Dudamel + Mahler 9,"Absolutely first rate orchestra in what must be one of the most acoustically refined venues on the planet. Went to a performance of Mahler 9 conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and sat on the first level on the left side of the hall. If you are familiar with this particular Symphony, the music dies away into silence which Dudamel dutifully held for an entire minute. You could truly hear a pin drop!

50,Don't miss the terraces and gardens outside,You have to experience a concert inside this beautiful hall. One big advantage is that nearly all seats are good so you don't need to always get the high priced seats. The sound and acoustics are stellar and during intermission you should take a walk outside and enjoy the elevated gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DariusLA
20,Beautiful Pain,"By their own admission, the Disney is uncomfortable for anyone over (as I recall) 5'8''. Sadly, I am over 6 feet. Last Sunday I sat through a performance of Mahler's Ninth, 90 minutes without an intermission. It has taken two days for my knees to stop hurting. If you were born in the last 70 years, do not go to the Disney unless you get an aisle seat.The architecture is superb, the acoustics OK, but the agony...!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162deanm

The gift store is pretty amazing too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolidog
40,Very cool building,"We stopped here primarily because we love the movie ""Get Smart"" and this building features prominently in that movie. We were extremely impressed with the architecture, and the surrounding outdoor area. We were here on a Saturday and had the pleasure of seeing several wedding parties here to take pictures. We went inside the building (primarily because we asked a street vendor for the closest public restroom and he directed us inside) and enjoyed the interior of the building. We unfortunately did not have the opportunity to see a concert, so cannot speak to that experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelrvo

50,Amazing work of architecture,"I am a lover of architecture. My Masters degree is in architectural history, so every trip I take is punctuated by architectural destinations. I was not sure whether Gehry's work would be a self-indulgent set of facades or something special. It was the latter. The fascinating exterior gave shape to interesting and well-defined spaces both inside and out. If you are lucky enough to see the main hall you will be impressed with the intimate feel and magnificent organ / sculpture. It is worth the trip downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W640UPkylew
50,Absolutely beautiful building - inside and out! Great acoustics.,"It is an absolutely beautiful building. Obviously, the exterior is stunning, but the inside is magnificent as well. The acoustics were phenomenal. Because I was alone, I was able to get an Orchestra, 2nd row, slightly off center seat. Fantastic; however, there does not appear to be a bad seat in the house. There's a giant pipe organ that is a work of art in itself. I would definitely recommend a visit. At a minimum, go look at the outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcgee49
50,Inspiring Architecture & Music!,"Whether its the architecture or the music in the round, this venue draws you in to explore and participate in the experience. The exterior is a photographer's delight; take the time to climb the various exterior paths and stairs to enjoy a multitude of discoveries visiting a different times of day to see how the light plays upon the shapes. The music setting allows one to feel as if they are sitting amidst the musicians. And there the intensity of emotion & interpretations can be discovered not only in the music, but in the personal character of each musician, each facial and body expression. This is a real treat and among the best music houses in the world to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2016Patti

We have sat in almost every section inside except the balcony, and there is not a bad seat in the house. There is a cafe in addition to several bars and a fascinating gift shop, as well as extensive gardens and outdoor space. Programming at Disney Hall is first rate and will keep you coming back.

50,Take the tour,"A wonderful hall. We like to sit on the side, above the orchestra, rather than down on the floor -- especially a little behind the orchestra. You can see the conductor's face. You are perched right above the musicians, so you can see them as they work.... Take the tour during the day; you will get to go to the top of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottaY9359AY

Once you get past the parking situation - or if you've been here once it's easy peasy 'cause you already know where it is - you're in for a gorgeous night.The structure and design of the auditorium is just fabulous. It's truly the kind of place that even the furthest seats feel included and close to the performance. If you've got yourself some near and center stage tickets, you're in heaven.The audio experience is indeed all that Disney Hall is touted for.The gift shop is delightful; especially at holiday time.Most musical acts will sign CD's after in the lobby next to the gift shop.You gotta make it here at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SerenaScholl
50,Beautiful venue-L.A. At it's best,I have been to the concert hall several times and each time I am struck by the beauty of the facility. The curve of the setting makes for a seats having great views and a feeling of a much smaller theater. Acoustics are great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/repeatvisitor_BD
50,Fantastic acoustics and service,"We attended the opening night of the LA Phil. Amazing program, well performed, great interdisciplinary work, etc. But I had a panic attack over the height of my seats 10 minutes before the curtain and the usher team resat me without drama and with complete sympathy. I <3 Disney Hall and would go back in a heartbeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phillytraveler71

The outdoor community park is a great place to have lunch or sip a coffee. Definitely worth the trip and ITS FREE!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDPfjl0702
50,Worth just to wander the beautiful grounds,"The distinctive, Frank Gehry designed structure is meant to evoke sheets of music blowing in the wind. While it may be difficult to picture this it is still a striking building and worth a visit even if you don’t venture inside. Surrounding the southern and western sides of the building are very peaceful and lush gardens which you can access during the daytime. It’s a great spot to have a quiet picnic lunch, relax and read a book on one of the many benches or simply seek shade from a hot summer’s day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
50,"Interesting from the outside, roomy on the inside","We recently attended the Stand Up To Cancer Telethon here, and it was a wonderful venue for the event. There was a wonderful room with a bar for the pre-party, a big area just inside the front doors for the press and celebs on the red carpet, and the large concert area itself. The staff at the bar and serving the appetizers were just wonderful. It really seemed like a perfect location for the telethon, and everything ran very smoothly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alyeska13

40,Walt Disney Concert Hall tour,We had an excellent Docent led tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. These tours are on Saturdays at 12:00 pm. Our tour guide was so knowledgeable about the building and history of the Concert Hall. I would definitely recommend attending this tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nestrada
50,Visited the building not to see a concert,just went to look inside and walk around. Its a fantastic walk up and around the building to see the skin close up and to understand how it was built. The plantings are great too. Not handicap accessible to all parts understandably as its climbing up the facade. But some areas are reachable -,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
50,I like the choice of seats,This is a masterpiece of a building. I like classical music and it was easy to see who was playing what instument from the seats I bought,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54aliced
50,Gorgeous Venue,"I've been to the Concert Hall a few times now and can even remember when they were still building it! Designed by world renowned architect, Frank Gehry, it is a masterpiece of metal and whimsy. Home to the LA Phil, it offers the musician and audience perfect listening enjoyment! There's a snack bar and a Patina restaurant inside... that shouldn't be missed! Ample parking across the street and underneath! Definitely visit this spot and take in a show if you have a chance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow
50,What a great facility!,We were fortunate to come on a Saturday when the concert hall was open for public tours. It was wonderful to speak with the docents and learn about the acoustics in the main performance center. The gardens and the architecture of the building were amazingly beautiful. We enjoyed walking up and down the stairs inside and out and it was great to be able to stop for a drink indoors when we were ready for a break.I would love to see a performance at this facility!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Movinup

50,Iconic Los Angeles Tourist Site!,"This site is fast becoming one of LA's iconic tourist sites, and it si easy to see why as you stand in front of it to admire its unique metallic facade.

50,Modern Architecture,"I didn't see any event or concert there (but i'm sure the inside is great). The whole building can be explored while there is no events happening inside.

50,Guiding Tour Of An Architectural Wonder,"We took the free guided tour of the concert hall and it was really cool (if you like architecture and probably even if you don't). The guide was excellent at describing both the artistic/architectural feature and theory behind the building but also some of the engineering challenges behind it too.We got lucky in that the actual concert hall was not being used at the time for a practice, so we were allowed to go inside and sit and have the guide described all of the things that makes the venue so good acoustically but also unique as a concert hall. So if you can make the sunday morning 10am tour, I think you'll get lucky, whereas a normal weekday during concert season is unlikely.The tour takes you inside and out and gives some of the history of the project and challenges faced.Overall it was 2 hours well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelt804
40,Grandeur on a Gigantic Scale,"The building and the hall themselves are imposing and awe-inspiring. The structure appears to have a lot of modern architectural principles involved in its design and construction, and the interiors apparently integrate several acoustic principles that take into account capacity, attendance, and temperature. The sense that comes off is one of elegant opulence along with commitment to a vision. Great pictures to be taken; might be even more visually aesthetic at night. Tour was a bit of a letdown as the guide could have done with a bit more experience in architecture and guide-work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anon00001
40,Can't view during a Concert,"We didn't know that you can't visit when a concert in playing. You can relax and watch the TV, or snack in the snack bar and listen to the music. Enjoyable just as much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA

40,Good Tour but Couldn't They Show Us the Concert Hall,We did the self-guided tour of the theatre which was well worth the trip. There is plenty of worshipful commentary on the various wealthy patrons but great insight into the design process and engineering of a great building. The tour is well marked. Just seems odd that it did not include a stop inside of the concert hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJMJanes
50,Work of Art,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is an excellent venue for a concert. Acoustically, there's not a bad seat in the house. The Terrace level provides a great view of the orchestra and the conductor at work, and I think is a better value than the Orchestra level seats. No matter where you sit, experiencing a concert at the Gehry designed concert hall is fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingangeleno

50,Amazing,"How do they keep that huge amazing building so clean and shiny. The beauty of it takes my breath away. I have attended many concerts here and the seating is comfortable and the sound right on perfect. I have also eaten in the cafe before a performance and find the food good, but expensive. I enjoy arriving early before a performance and climbing the outside stairs to the rooftop gardens. These are open free to the public. High above the city are park benches, cleverly laid out gardens with many variety of flowers and trees and a huge blue rose fountain mosaic to honor Mrs. Disney. You cannot hear the noise of the city from up here. I have in the past taken a paid tour of the inside of the Concert Hall and it was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugarmillgirl
50,Architectural Treasure,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is an extraordinary building that dominates the landscape. The sweeps in the ceilings make you wander around it both inside and outside and marvel. Located next to the fabulous Broad Museum of Contemporary Art it's in a precinct where you can just sit and enjoy looking at it - it's fascinating, with the light playing a part in highlighting its architecture - worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanneg550

50,Beautiful and interesting,"I like the Downtown LA music center area and this is definitely a jewel in that crown. The architecture is impressive and the interior is even more interesting. When I go to concerts or performances there, the first few minutes are spent soaking in the great interior. Initially the acoustics were not great, but now, it is a treat. If you don't have time for a concert, you can walk around and there is even a path that takes you to the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaBalt
50,Awesome spot to gawk at an awesome building,Great spot to gawk at the construction of an awesome building. I have yet to attend a concert at the Disney Hall. Simply a matter of time and money and sometime it will happen.In the meantime I have walked and gawked st the building. It is set up with pathways and portals to invite the casual visitor. Well worth the time to stop and gawk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,What a view...,Went to see the skill and art of the design. Was not disappointed. The place is amazing to see. There is a cafe to visit on really hot days . The inside is nice but does not quite match the exterior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charleso3
40,Excellent venue,"I've been living in Southern California all my life, and am a frequent patron of live performances. I used to have season tickets to the Ahmanson, Pantages, and even the old Shubert... yet never set foot at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, until this Memorial Weekend.Built in 2003, the Walt Disney Concert Hall is home to the LA Philharmonic and in 2009, Gustavo Dudamel (aka ""The Dude"") became the LA Phil's Music Director.My first experience attending a live, classical performance was in Berlin, where we saw Sir Simon Rattle conduct the Berlin Philharmonic. We had seats in the front, and all I saw was the side and back of the conductor.When I purchased tickets to see ""The Dude"", I made sure to get an elevated seat, to the side in Orchestra West, so we can see the facial expression of the conductor. The tickets were not cheap. Ticketmaster charged me $136.50 + $12.50 service fee ... almost $150 per ticket. It was cheaper to go to Berlin.. yikes!We arrived 2 hours early, parked in their underground (entrance located across from The Broad museum) for $9.00. We walked across the street to Kendall's Brasserie for brunch, and arrived at the WDCH a little after 1:00 (for a 2:00 performance).During the third piece, second movement, the fire alarm went off. A few patrons scurried out the exit door (every man and woman for themselves!) and even a 2nd string violinist ran off the stage, only to come back red faced to hear seat.The security people came out, and asked us to remain calm. They kept us informed that nothing unusual happened, and that it was a false alarm. We continued with the program, and it ended quite well.Overall a good venue for classical music. I would recommend my elevated orchestra seats for a better view of the stage. You can really see the performers get into their music, and even follow the facial expression of the conductor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
40,Great free audio tour from 10-2. parking was problematic,"I parked at the Disney as I wanted to take the free audio tour. Before I did that though, I peaked over at the Broad and found that there were only 3 people in the standby line - so of course I ran across the street. After my Broad visit I came back to Disney for the audio tour. It was great! Cannot recommend it enough.I found that they did not validate for more than three hours because I guess the idea is that if you visit the Broad you park there, then you drive across the street to Disney to park there and get there validation. So LA!Trying to pay for parking was not easy. There were few signs and by the time another hapless visitor and I worked it out after running up and down escalators various times, we drove our cars to P4 to the one parking machine they seem to have, and then drove out to Lower Grand - not the exit I wanted to use.So visit was great, trying to get away from the visit not so much.Share validation between facilities, and get more parking machines!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRKPinCH41
50,An iconic must-do when in L.A.,"This building has become the iconic architectural wonder representing the best ofLos Angeles for a good reason. It's wonderful to walk around the outside but even better to take a tour of the interior. The acoustics are perfect - all entertainers who perform here rave about their experience - so, ideally, grab a ticket for a concert and have an epicnight out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxskin
50,Love Frank Gehry,The architecture of this building is amazing. All Frank Gehry's buildings are works of art. The outside does get hot in the sun due to all the metal. The inside is spacious and well designed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
30,uncomfortable seatings,"Although it has been open for so many years we did not have opportunity to visit until a friend sang in a choral performance at the hall. The architecture inside is impressive as outside, but the seats were extremely uncomfortable, reminded me of Staples Center, and we were in better location than when I was at the sports arena! It was OK for a one time but we are not music lovers so I am not sure we will be attending any more concerts there. We are not overweight, I cannot fathom how someone heavier or taller could seat and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbiscuitt
50,Breathtakingly Beautiful,"I believe, in my humble opinion, this is one of Frank Gehry's loveliest creations. The first time I saw it I was awestruck and could only stand across the street admiring his genius. I will admit, after several years the sight of it still takes my breath away. Kudos and well done Mr. Gehry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt

20,garish and uncomfortable.,"Viewing the glaringly sun-reflecting pile of tin in an otherwise somewhat structurally attractive part of Los Angeles prepared us for the cheaply garish interior, but not for the steep balcony stairways nor for the tight seating. Rather took away from enjoyment of the performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wladziu

40,Beautiful Architecture and Music Hall,"Awesome free walking tour you can do by yourself. You can get (90's cellphone looking) hand-held speaker, map and told the general direction you will go. The tour is again free and takes you to many parts of the music hall that are absolutely breath-taking. You cannot see the inside performance hall on the tour. But if you are lucky enough like we were they might be doing something in there and you get to watch. You cannot take pictures while they are working but you can look around and if they leave then you can take pictures. We couldn't they were in there the whole time. It is beautiful and there are lots of pretty pictures online and in the gift shop. Some of the stops on the tour and not that interesting and might be boring for children and teens. But if you keep going through you will see some pretty parts of the Hall. The outside is stunning and with the beautiful LA weather you can take a picnic lunch and enjoy the down-town views.Nice FREE activity. The only thing you have to pay for is parking which is a decent $9. Be sure to get the people at the table to validate your ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25katiec

We have attended a number of concerts there and the acoustics are excellent. If you want to maximize your experience, plan a full day around it. Spend the afternoon at the Broad which is just a block away. Enjoy a quality dinner at Patina, the restaurant next to the Concert Hall. Then top off your evening with a performance at the Concert Hall. The day may be a bit expensive but totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debralynnet

There is a self guided audio tour and a free guided tour available. The interior and exterior are a wonder of design and thought. The docent who led the tour was a lively, enthusiastic lady who obviously loved the building and her part in telling the history. The cafe in the lobby, Patina, has a lovely lunch selection and is not unreasonably priced for downtown L A. This is a must see when you come to Los Angeles. Frank Gehry, the architect who designed the Concert Hall is the premier architect of our time. Don't miss an opportunity to visit as it is truly a marvel of artistic beauty and accoustical design combined for the publics pleasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janepI9693UV
50,Amazing Acoustics,"The hall is wood paneled inside with acoustic baffling, so sound carries very well. The seating is arranged so every seat feels close to the artist. It's a beautiful venue . . both visually and acoustically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282daved
50,Must see,"We knew this was a great achievement architecturally but we weren't prepared for how fascinating and beautiful the place really was. We went on a free tour led by a wonderfully enthusiastic and knowledgeable lady who pointed out so much of Frank Gehry's inspiration in designing the building. The park on level 3 is a must see, with a fountain made from Delft pottery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dnwjames
40,Nice Facility,"I went here for the Chinese New Year Show and Performance. Overall, I like the stunning architecture design of this place, both outside and inside the lobby, gift shop and cafe. The cafe inside, run by Patina, serves restaurant style food, but very expensive. I didn't try, so I can't comment on it.Even the concert hall itself, the seats, and stage were arranged very well. Since I'm not a fan of opera or classical music, I would not come here again just for that. Overall, a great venue, if you just want photos, or if you are interested in opera or classical music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gillurien
40,Brilliant architecture..,Wow is the word. The place enthralls you with out of the world architecture. The Disney has become a tourist attraction in itself due to the the brilliant design. And I did not even know it's existence.Thank God for the driver of our Limo who insisted on taking us here. Great place. Please put this as a part of you LA itinerary. Even as a 15 minute pitstop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania

50,Disney Wins Again,"We piggybacked on an alumni college tour and found the tour guide knowledgeable and interesting. Tour or not, folks can find a shaded balcony fit for a picnic or a place to rest/ meditate after a hot shopping day in LA. Tickets for a concert in the concert hall itself are pricey, but the acoustics and architecture are truly worth experiencing. If by chance you can attend a performance featuring the organ you will be amazed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxanney646

50,Great acoustics!,"Numerous concert visits at the Walt Disney Hall have proven that there are no ""bad"" seats, the acoustics are phenomenal everywhere. The organ is one of the finest ever built in the world. The program has a high variety. Little pricy tickets, in particular when you go as a family, however, money well spent and worth the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UlrikeZ280
40,"Aside from some cramped seating, sonic miracles happen here.","Frank Ghery's sui generis edifice houses the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra…a virtuoso ensemble that plays everything acoustic. Although a ticket is not cheap, if you're in L.A. for a visit or on business you could do far worse in spending a few extra entertainment bucks. When Gustavo Dudamel is conducting the place really lights up. You might even like to get a seat facing the conductor in back of the percussion section by the astounding pipe organ to feel like your part of the orchestra itself.Come an hour and a half before the concert and enjoy their cafeteria offerings which are always fresh and delicious and then mosey to the free pre-concert lecture to learn about what you'll be hearing.You might also like to check out the gift shop to bring your kids or grandkids a fascinating musical souvenir.Seeing the L.A. Phil play together is like watching the finest sports team in synch at the peak of their powers.

50,One of the most interesting and beautiful concert halls in the world. A must-see,"While in LA on business, we took a VIP tour of the Walt Disney concert hall.

The Walt Disney Concert Hall is both incredibly beautiful with stunning architecture, and one of the best functioning musical venues we have ever seen. Be sure to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96ralphd
40,Wonderful Walking Tour,I did not have a chance to see one of the shows here but we went on a independent walking tour and got to see the whole building. Typical Frank Gehry with all twists and turns and the unusual highlights. It is the most unusual building I have seen in a awhile but a real innovator in design and you could tell the acoustics were good at a practice session that was going on inside. Rather small stage for such a large building. I can't wait to see a show there on my next trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
40,WDCH home of LA Philharmonic,"Home of the LA Philharmonic the Walt Disney Concert Hall, designed by Frank Gehry, opened on 24 October 2003. The striking exterior of the hall immediately attracts visitors. While most of the building's exterior was designed with stainless steel given a matte finish, the Founders Room and Children's Amphitheater were designed with highly polished mirror-like panels. The hall is located at South Grand Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArindamGhosh01
40,Visual feast,Despite not much going on in Down Town on the hot sunny sunday that we chose to visit the walk around the outside and roof terraces of The Disney Concert Hall was well worth it.We expected it to be unbearably hot walking around those reflective metal surfaces but instead the garden areas were shady and refreshingly cool.It is a great place to catch photos of the area with such dramatic foreground sculptures.

Also, we happened to be there on a Friday, and the performance by the LA Philharmonic was not sold out, so they had a ticket rush at 6:00 for Seniors and students. We were able to get seats in the 4th row (normally $186) for $20! The concert hall is wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckBrooks
40,Roof Top Gardens,"This was worth the trek from another roof top garden a few blocks away. While the garden itself isn't worth a special trip outside of an hour's drive, it was shady and pleasant. We enjoyed following the spiral path and discovering where each set of stairs took us.The architecture of the concert hall was fabulous! The movement, angles, and wonderment were gracefully spectacular!I will try to post a couple photos . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
30,If you have extra time,"If you have extra time and are visiting here to see other things, drop by for a tour or event a concert. It's one of those things to tell people - I've seen it, I've been there. Of course, if you are in the neighborhood you have to include this visit.

40,"Beautiful building, great audiotour, expensive parking","Impressive from the outside and at every corner on the inside, we enjoyed the concert hall through a great (free) audiotour. Take plenty of time to see it all, including the terrace on the upperfloor and the stairs at the side of the buidling. The mainconcerthall itself is not open for public, but on the tour you can see a video of the interior.We parked our car in the garage under the concerthall and payed 20 dollars for nearly 2 hours of parking. There's a cafe on site, quite expensive for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtistheP
50,Hearing is Believing at Walt Disney Concert Hall,"Frank Gehry's concert hall with it's flying stainless steel skinned structure was quite a shock to traditional Downtown LA when it opened in 2003. But once the LA Master Chorale and LA Philharmonic discovered the exceptional acoustics, the battle was won. I subscribe to both groups and love looking at the at the blond Douglas Fir interior. Besides these two, catch an organ recital when you can. The organ facade was also designed by Gehry. An added bonus is the garden which is a restful area crowned by a huge sculpture of one of Lillian Disney (family donated major of funds) favorite roses. Tours are available. Check out their website for more details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamePeg

50,"Hidden gardens, great music","Even if you are not a lover of music, this unique structure in DTLA is a must. For the architecture aficionado, the appeal is obvious. Take a walk around the structure, make sure to head up to the roof (accessible via the outside stairs) to the great rooftop garden; a quite little oasis in DTLA. The concerts are worth it, especially if you can score affordable tickets and the hall is beautiful with amazing acoustics. Bothe the gift shop and the cafe offer interesting fare and lots of gift ideas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sotraveling

LA Phil's hut is what fueled downtown L.A's urban comeback.Then everything is very close, the modern art museum, the Broad and for those who don't focus only on institutions, Downtown LA is a feast for american architecture: the Continental building is a feast at South Spring and west fourth, then there is the grand central market, the Anthony Quinn mural at 3rd street and my favorite light installation on the bridge over Santa Ana Freeway, at Los Angeles street, that links W Aliso str and Arcadia Str.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek
50,The Sound is Great and the Hall Lovely.,"Walt Disney Concert Hall is beautiful. It is in the heart of downtown LA. Parking is okay, it is for a fee and there is walking involved, but it is doable. The Hall itself is beautiful. Designed by Frank Gehry, it is modern with lots of sheet metal (he really needs to get a new idea) and very interesting. More importantly, the seats are great and the sound in the Hall is perfect. It was designed for concerts. The Phil plays there a lot (it is their home). There are a few god restaurants in walking distance (Water Grill). Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

50,One of the greatest places in DTLA,"I had a wonderful experience last night at the Disney Concert Hall seeing YoYo Ma.

50,Review of outside of building only,"Even if you don't have concert tickets to go inside, this is a downtown landmark that you should definitely visit if you are in the area. Its an extraordinarily bold Frank Gehry steel-like structure with a mini garden on the side that's facing Flower/Hope Street. On any given day, you will see brides walking around as this is definitely a big photo spot. You will definitely see some photo shoots. There is a even a mini circular stage that's outdoors. This is great architecture located next to another great new one- The Broad! So if you are planning to go to the Broad museum, you should definitely cross the street and take a walk up the stairs and look at the stage and garden that includes a cool mosaic water fountain. If you have more time and able to do some stairs, walk behind the stage and you will find another set of stairs going towards the roof where you can enjoy views of downtown from different angles. The concert hall has a lot of glass windows so you will get to see the inside from the top which has pretty neat views. Oh, the garden has a few tables that you can stop and have a snack at or read a book. (Food not sold on site but some stuff nearby).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelinh1
50,Fantastic Concert Hall To Hear Music!!!,Went with my wife and friend to hear count Basie orchestra for Christmas holiday jazz. The band of course was great but what is really great is the sheer sound quality at the hall! It's like being inside of a high end speaker is the only way to describe it. And the seats are all great for viewing as well as listening. The cafeteria has really amazing food for what I can only describe as a high end cafeteria! And the retail store is a treat with all the music and gift items you could want.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillipW826

50,Wow!!,This building is amazing. The story about it and how it was started by Walt Disney's widow is remarkable. The small stories about the heat it generated for the surrounding buildings is also interesting and how they overcame it. We did not get into the concert hall but just admired it from the outside. Next time we will get an inside tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntarcticBound
40,Great architecture inside & outside,"We didn't plan to go the concert hall, but we couldn't get our eyes off of the building and when we found out it's a Walt Disney Concert Hall we decided to pay a visit.Unfortunately the timing was not right. Tour guide was unavailable and though I read in the review afterwards that they provide a self guided audio tour, we did not find that information on site. But they allowed us to stroll around and have a look at the concert hall inside.The architecture is not only great from the outside, but the concert hall is designed in such a meticulous way not only to look stunningly beautiful and modern, but to maximize the audio function of a hall with a touch of Disney's classic behind the modern lines.One of the pleasant thing they have is the lotus garden on the third floor. It's a nice place to wind down and relax a bit before you continue to the next adventure in LA.Public transportation was pretty difficult in this area. Best to use online transport application.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fluffyplo
50,"Great, Free Self-Guided Tour","This remarkable concert hall commands attention. It is gorgeous from the outside and just as gorgeous inside.The self guided tour includes an audio program that tells you many interesting things about this architectural masterpiece.

50,Amazing,"Fantastic place to visit and it's free to go through! We did the self guided audio tour, just had to lodge some ID with the staff to get the audio wands and we were off. You could wander around without the audio but there is so much information you get that makes you look and gaze it how and why they built it the way they did. A lot of detail would be missed with out it.Being in the gardens you don't think about it until they tour says you are on the top floor and there are trees and lovely gardens there on the roof.The downtown city line view was good, we were there on a bleak day so could have been nicer weather but still very good.Expect to spend a good couple of hours to see everything fully, well recommended for all ages.Parking is hard to find but there is a good spot a wee bit down the road under ground that is easily accessible if you can find it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daz233
50,A treat for the eyes and ears!,"Extraordinary architecture and acoustics make this a visually and aurally remarkable place. The (free) self-guided audio tour of the Frank-Gehry-designed building is worth doing. Better yet is to buy a ticket to a performance so that you can visit the inside of the hall itself -- unique seating configuration, surrounding the stage, allows for unexpected perspectives on the performers. We sat behind and above the orchestra so that we were facing the conductor. Unusual and interesting. An exceptional cultural venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EGDandMGD

We weren't able to go into the concert hall that day :( and people were filming in the garden so we couldn't walk completely through there but super informative and educational. Our guide Randall was awesome too. Totally recommend. Offered at 1030 and 1230. Just walk in and sign up in the front at the table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizeryztool

50,Worth the Stop,"We love architecture; modern and historic... and buildings are always a tourist attraction that we don't miss. My husband thought that the building was amazing from an engineering perspective... I thought is was cool, but thought that the architect had too much input for the whole project; ugly outside sculpture and inside carpets! Anyway, it is FREE, and definitely worth the stop. If you cannot make the tour times, they have a self paced audio. Parking below is a good value, and combine in with a trip to the Cathedral or the Broad, and you are good for most of the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieMSanDiego

40,Symphonian Tour,"I went on a free guided tour of Walt Disney Concert Hall, Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson Theatre, and Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and I highly recommend it, especially if you are into theatre and music. One just as to sign up at the foyer of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. there was only 3 people in our group that day and the Guides were most welcoming and very knowledgable about the music centre. You can feel their passion for it just by talking to them! Truely wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicapui
50,Stunning Design and the Best Concert Acoustics Anywhere,"We drove up to Los Angeles for a Sunday matinee performance of the Los Angeles Philharmonic's concert performance of the great Debussy opera ""Pelleas et Melisande"" conducted by the esteemed Laureate Conductor Salonen. Both orchestral music and vocal music blossom in the stellar acoustical environment of this immaculately designed hall. Even from the back balcony, the sound is present and palpable--clear and resonant. No seat is far from the stage, which is hardly the case in 99% of modern shoe-box design concert halls (including the one across the street--The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion). Frank Ghery's sweeping curves and elegant use of wood on the interior please the eye but never overpower the senses. I will take this hall over Carnegie Hall any day of the week!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279kenh

50,World Class Hall in the middle of Los Angeles,"I've been a subscriber to the LA Philharmonic for years, both at Disney Hall and the Hollywood Bowl. Acoustics are amazing in this place - you feel like you are a part of the orchestra. Parking is convenient and on the few rainy days we have, it is nice to not have to walk outside. The little café is fine for a quick bite, if a little pricey. Patina is a place for a splurge. My only issue with the hall is the cramped seating - everyone complains about it. I guess that is why the concerts are rarely over 2 hrs including intermission. But the sound and experience almost makes up for the confined seating. If you are over 6 feet, be forewarned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRwestla

50,The crown on LA's Bunker Hill,"Walt Disney Concert Hall is a must-see in L.A.'s cultural center. The lobby is open to the public during the day, and be sure to go up the exterior stairs on the S. Grand Avenue side up to the garden which has the rose-shaped fountain made out of 1,000 broken Delft vases, a tribute to Walt Disney's wife, Lillian, who collected Delft pottery. (There is also an elevator from street level at the corner of 1st Street and Hope Street). From the garden level you can explore the walkways along the roofline up to the top of the building. If you want to hear the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra play, note that the inexpensive seats behind the orchestra (facing the conductor) are excellent. If you want refreshments at intermission, be sure to pre-order at the bar before the performance to avoid the long line during intermission. The REDCAT theatre lobby bar has a bohemian vibe and better coffee and drinks than the concessions inside Disney Hall; REDCAT is beneath Disney Hall, at the corner of 2nd Street and Hope Street - you can carry your drinks through parking level P3 and up the escalator to the Disney Hall lobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JVPURINS
40,good even to walk around outside!,"We were there late in the afternoon (4 or 5 PM?) so the tours were over, but it was nice to simply wander around outside, both in the front and in the back gardens (there is an outside elevator on the corner of S Hope and W 1st Street to get to the garden).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abh345678

50,Either inside or outside....,A trip to Disney hall can be accomplished either by buying tickets to see the LA Phil during their season. Which of course is an excellent choice. I recently saw Dudamel conduct Music of The Americas...totally wonderful. But you can also enjoy visiting the Hall just for the architecture. There is a little tour that you can do but you can also just go down there walk around take great photos...There's your Christmas Card shot... and then go across the street to MOCA and dine at Lemonade. Then if you feel inspired go into MOCA and maybe then the Broad. A very nice outting indeed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
50,First Class All The Way!,"Absolutely stunning architecture by Frank Gehry.Opened in 2003 and is an acoustic treasure. Any musical performance you see here will blow you away. Very professional employees, very clean and pristine on the inside, valet parking is available if you don't want to deal with searching for a lot or garage and very elegant on-site restaurant, Patina, as well as an awesome museum gift shop. DO NOT miss the hidden roof-top garden patio and the mosaic rose fountain made in honor of Lily Disney. ALL I can say is WOW. This concert hall is aces in my book!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyM265
50,Phenomenal acoustics! Awesome venue!,"A truly signature music and events venue, the Disney Concert Hall is just as beautiful and well appointed inside as it is architecturally appealing outside.

The seats are comfortable, there's plenty of underground parking, the concourses are very wide and roomy, and there are food and beverage options with in. Love attending events there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
50,"If you can't get to Spain, be sure to visit this Gehry piece of architecture","As fine an auditorium as you'd want to visit.

The area is becoming a cultural center with the Broad Museum, MOCA, the new Catholic church and new restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyemlucky
40,Architectural Beauty,"I'd just missed the guided tour, so did the audio tour. The girls at the tour desk weren't particularly welcoming, I felt like I was disturbing them. But I found all the ushers and box office were friendly. John Lithgow is your guide and there are helpful signs following the tour route, so you don't stray from the path too much. It's a lovely building and every material used has a purpose and a meaning behind it. My favourite part was the garden; an oasis in the city.

30,Nice Tour,"The concert hall is beautiful, creative, and probably the most architecturally interesting building in LA (just ahead of the Peterson Automotive Museum. We took the audio tour of the concert hall. It was very informative, although at times it got a little bit dull; I have a feeling that the guided tour wold be a bit less dull due to the human interaction. However, there are people all over able to answer question. The only upsetting part is that you can't see the actual main auditorium (you can't see it on any tour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
50,Great concert hall,"I love this place. The acoustics are magnificent. I've seen everything from classical to Christmas choir music to rock and roll.

Whether listening to a full symphony or a piano recital this is the place to hear music in a perfect setting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expectquality1942
50,A beautiful space for beautiful music,"The fact that I'm giving a 5-rating on the furthest seats from the stage (quite literally the very back row in the highest section of the hall) should really tell you something about how special this space is.My friend and I both have backgrounds in music - she an instrumentalist and myself a classical and commercial vocalist. We were looking forward to a wonderful night of music with the philharmonic, and were both completely blown away by the acoustics of this place, even from our high seats. It's not an exaggeration to say that you can hear a person turning pages on the other side of the hall -- the sounds are so crisp and so clear, that the barest rustle of a page or shifting of the seat can be heard anywhere in the room.The focal point of the hall is the organ, which is truly spectacular, but everything about the interior of this space is special. John Williams actually wrote a piece inspired by the architecture of the concert hall, and we were fortunate enough to not only hear it played as part of the Music of the Americas program that Dudamel was conducting that night, but witnessed the composer himself brought on stage following the performance. (Naturally, he was given a standing ovation.)I would love to come back for another performance, and I am pleased to know that, no matter what seats I end up sitting in, the experience will be nothing short of memorable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittshotts
50,Don't forget the community gardens around the back!,"We've taken friends several times to see the famous and gloriouis Geary building (both inside and out), but this time we walked around the outside too.

50,"Wander in on a whim, or attend a concert: an inviting landmark","Some concert halls hum even without an orchestra playing. Walt Disney hums, and whistles, and sings out loud. It's a fun building that actually far more user friendly than the shiny, deconstructed exterior might suggest. Full of nooks and crannies, the building even sports an inside/outside walkway path than climbs to the rooftop, offering astonishing views as well as look at the internal structure of the place. Right at the top of list of free things to do in L.A., it's also one of the best values even when you pay. Students get in for next to nothing when the concerts aren't sold out, but regular tickets can be had for around $50. Come here or miss the best of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fiftyfourcountries

30,The Exterior is a Wonder of the World,"Seeing it from the outside is breath-taking, awe-inspiring. Inside, it's breathable and the awe is manageable, which is a nice way of saying the acoustics are passable, especially from front orchestra level. Best to go when Dudamel brings the Simon Bolivar Orchestra.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Primo54
40,"Weird layout, but interesting","Unfortunately we were not in town for a full symphonic experience, but we were able to attend a solo piano recital at Disney Hall. The building is an amazing architectural achievement, but as a first-time concert-goer, it was very confusing. Once in our seats, though, I have to say I was impressed with the fact that there is not a bad seat in the house. The way the seats are tiered and set around the stage (symphony in the round) makes it possible to love your balcony seat without envy of the orchestra section. The organ is the definitive center piece. We didn't get to hear it, but it is a bizarre and wonderful work of art. The gardens are a nice addition off the 3rd floor, with a nice view of downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maffyd2018
40,Really cool,"Really cool excursion to Disney Concert Hall. The architecture will blow your mind, and it was definitely way cool to get a nice view of downtown and see the Los Angeles Downtown district.

Instead I was greeted with a very in depth tour about the architecture of building itself. We did learn some interesting facts about the garden but other than that not much. We spoke very briefly about the music hall (which is not open to tours), the stage and organ. Of the whole tour I enjoyed the 10 minutes we spent talking about that. Not really what I was expecting, especially at 90 minutes long! In my mind I would not recommend for any concert music fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877alic

I saw Disney Hall going up and it was amazing to watch. It is one of architect Frank Gehry's greatest buildings and a must see. If you read the history of the building it almost didn't get built. That would have been a disaster.At least go walk around and admire the building. That is free. Or take a tour or better yet attend a concert. Tha inside and acoustics are wonderful.

I sat in different locations on each of the concerts and there really isn't a bad seat. The venue was constructed very well acoustically. In fact, if you would like to know more about the venue you can take a free audio guided tour through the venue, narrated by the awesome John Lithgow. Which was my 4th trip. There is a roof top garden that holds a beautiful lotus flower fountain, as well as a fun view of the city. The outside can be very hot in the summer due to the metal coating.Put it on your to do list if it's not already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellisinla

50,Heavenly Music,The acoustics in this venue are outstanding. Any seat gets excellent acoustics. The program is very varied and you should find something suitable if you survey the program before you visit. But book your seat promptly. Just seating in the auditorium is inspiring.

50,Silver Scraper Full of Golden Delight,"The outside is an amazing architectural wonder. Did you know originally this building was polished, but they had to change the finish to matte because the brightness from the sun actually relfected way too much heat to nearby apartment dwellers, therefore, turning on their air-conditioning units too often? If you're visiting LA and don't get to attend a concert, you'd still enjoy taking pictures of this landmark. The concert hall is state of the art and the orchestra is fantatic so take in a concert if you can. You can take the children to see the outside of the building and then eat in nearby Chinatown or go to Philips for a yummy hot roast beef. Also nearby is the pueblo village where the first Mexicans settle. Across the street from that is Union Station, the train station that has been renovated. Architectural delights!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R0ckettWriter

50,"Beautiful, inside and out","The gorgeous exterior of this venue gets a lot of attention, but the acoustics inside the hall are really well designed for the range of performances that are hosted here, and there doesn't seem to be a bad sightline anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
50,Astonishing Architecture!,"I knew I wanted to see it but I had no idea that I would like it that much. There is free audio tour available that gives you a lot of information about the building and its numerous functions and I really recommend doing it! The interior and garden of the building are are as impressive as the outside. The only ""fly in the ointment"" is that you usually can't see the actual concert hall, which is unique qith the natural light etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/662antoniab
50,One of the finest concert halls in the world,"This hall is a sight to see inside and out with some of the best acoustics in the world.

50,Fantastic Architecture,A very different design and stands out on the Broadway. Also has free audio tours when one deposits a photo identity. Good history of the Disney family's contribution towards its construction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diwyesh
50,Nice building,"Walked here on our own, actually just taking pictures of the building. We were having speed tours on our own, so didn't get in. It's a nice sculpture building and back to childhood and memorable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leowaniel
40,Informative,"Architecture, family involvement - a creation that took a real team effort. It was once designed to be concrete and the architect struggled to accept an aluminum approach. It fits so well into its location. Do the self-guided tour to find out why the name Walt Disney is lightly etched into the entrance - and how the family reacted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697pats
50,"Even the ""cheap"" seats are great","We went here for NY eve & bought 5 seats together late so they were about very high up on the seating chart. Wasn't expecting to be able to see very well, but they were great. Because of the design, you feel like you're right there in the action. Saw Gladys Knight and at $120 each for ""nose bleed"" seats, they weren't cheap, but the venue made it a worthwhile evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NMBomber

10,Bizarre Horrible parking experience,"Parked here as recommended for attending MOCA. Upon returning was forced to travel to all corners of the building to get parking ticket paid and taken care of. Security Officers I spoke with seemed to have heard my disbelief in the nonsense required of visitors plenty of times before. SOMETHING VERY WRONG HERE, DO NOT RECOMMEND USING PARKING GARAGE. YOU WILL WALK A MILE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cubecritter
40,One of the most beautiful buildings I have every seen.,"The amazing architecture attracts photographers at the front, and the world class LA Philharmonic attracts the classical music fans. We watched Itzhak Perlman conduct.The only downside was a major lack of toilets. There were large queues before, during interval, and afterwards. I would not be surprised if some people missed out - not so good being uncomfortable and trying to enjoy a concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2946TZbenjamins
40,AMAZING ARCHITECTURE,This is an amazing structure inside and out. They offer a free self guided tour with audio which most places don't offer for free. Would definitely recommend to anyone that love architecture and music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sebastian825dlb
50,Impressive Architecture,We were lucky to manage to get inside the theater in a closed day so we could appreciate it quietly and admire its iconic architecture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndreiDiaconescu
50,Frank Gehry Does It Again,The architecture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall is nothing short of spectacular. I've been to the Guggenheim in Bilbao and the Marques de Riscal in El Ciego and can state unequivocally that the Hall is every bit as remarkable as Gehry's other masterpieces.Take the free audio tour and listen carefully to the descriptions. It will take 90 minutes and you will enjoy every second.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strassbeee
40,"Interesting, quick activity","We had a few hours to spend on our last day in L.A. before going to the airport, and the Disney hall is located within a short walk from Union Station. They offer several different tour options, one of which is free with an excellent audioguide. Show up whenever you like, grab an audioguide in the lobby (you have to leave an ID as collateral) and off you go. The tour is billed as taking about an hour, but you can move at your own pace. The audioguide is narrated by John Lithgow and includes interviews with the architect, members of the Disney family, the man who designed the acoustics, etc. Very interesting and informative. Employees are stationed throughout the building to help direct you to elevators and stairs throughout the tour. The only disappointing aspect is that you usually cannot go into the actual main concert hall because it is frequently in use for rehearsals, but otherwise you see most areas of the building including outside areas. Overall it's a nice way to see something unique and the fact that it's free and done at your convenience is a bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9001YLwilliamm
40,Amazing building and free on weekends incl FREE audio tour.,Went to this building on Saturday around 12:30PM. It is an amazing building to look at from the outside - but inside is where the beauty is. We were very positively surprised that there were no fee to walk around and see it all inside. If you like (think it is a good idea) there is also a FREE audio tour... very nice place to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCDane

50,"If you live or visit LA, plan to see a show here","We lived in LA for three years and went here twice - once on Halloween night when an organist did the ""soundtrack"" to a silent horror film. Another time was for a philharmonic show. Both were great experiences. The decor and acoustics are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiegoCandela
30,Just went for the self guided tour.,We were next door at the Broad Museum and came here because we saw people up near the roof. It was free and worth every penny!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckCRNA
50,Not a bad seat in the house,Acoustically outstanding venue---I always get the cheapest seats as there's just no bad one in the entire auditorium. Only downside is all the fake walls and spaces everywhere on the outside that have no functional purpose other than decoration. Kind of a waste of materials and undermines integrity of structure,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burbatana
40,Disney Hall - An Architechtural Delight in the Heart of L.A.,"This is a first rate concert hall; likely one of the best in the country, if not the world. It's great fun to visit and just look at. Candidly, and while the acoustics are amazing inside the hall itself, the common areas inside are a bit weird and confining. The hall itself is wonderful and the exterior is wonderful.Very worth a visit to see a show. Worth a trip to see and photograph, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG918
30,nice Building,"i was there but only on the outside, it looks nice but thats it. i was there in the morning and the doors were locked xD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weezlee
50,"Beautiful building, perfect acoustics, not enough leg room",Definitely worth the visit and one should attend a performance of the LA Phil. The acoustics are near perfect. Take one of the free Symphonian tours. Only problem with Disney Hall is there should be more leg room for most of the seats. We have season tickets and I always enjoy the music but after the concert my knees really hurt and I am average height.Parking is reasonable for downtown and it is in the structure. If you are just there for the tour they will give you stickers for 1/2 off on the parking. Tour and the gardens are free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snktlk
50,A concert at Disney Hall is great,"We experienced a concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at Disney Hall. The music selection was excellent, the interaction of the conductor with the audience was very entertaining but the experience in the Hall was the highlight. The design features are very dramatic and, as you would expect, the acoustics are tremendous.Allow some time to walk around the hall (both inside and outside) before the concert begins so you can take in the magnificence of the Gehry design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerald_Froschauer
50,Must see!,This is a beautiful building inside and out. You can take a free self-guided tour most days but you can't see inside the concert hall unless you attend a concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29

50,Scrumptious!,We went before seeing the Count Basie Orchestra at Disney Hall and the experience was terrific. We took a guest from NYC and were so impressed ourselves that it didn't matter that she was over the moon. We had the three courses and all chose differently!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaSenora8484
50,One of the best concert halls in the world!,"Took a tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall over the Christmas holiday. Our tour guide, Judith Amos was outstanding. If you can request her, do so. The interior of this facility is as unique with the many views, mostly ocean or sea worthy, as the architect incorporated this into his design. It is his ""thing"" apparently. Yet, the exterior is what draws the applause. The aluminum sheeting is so unique. The grounds have been expertly designed and maintained. Our tour also included the other three performing theaters in downtown LA. Be sure to do this tour, as it includes venues for ballet, opera, theatre and musicals. LA is entertainment and this section of downtown is worth your time. Tour is free too. Stated to be the best acoustical hall in the world. Booked year round, thus we could not see the interior seating of the theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shuttrrbug
40,Really interesting architecture open to the public.,Did the self guided audio tour (free). It took around 45 min and you got to see the interior and exterior of the hall. Interesting and worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenG269
30,GIRLFRIENDS TRIP,"Parking is expensive... hours are brief...must be fit to climb all the levels outside. Never found ""gardens"". Walked to Grand Park which I had never seen even thoughI've lived here 30 years. Probably should've done more research.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m2happy
50,Modern and unique building,"Converts, orchestra, musicians that come to perform from all over the world are all amazing. I had subscriptions and have been going to the concerts at least 4-5 times a year. My family had very nice experience every time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaR_13
50,Architect and Musicians DREAM!!!,My husband and I are both musicians (teachers and performers) and we were thrilled with the Phil and guest pianist performing an all-Rachmaninoff performance. The architecture and acoustics are amazing! GO SEE!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shchristy
50,Interesting architecture with outstanding orchestra,"The LA Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the highlights of Los Angeles. It is an outstanding orchestra and the WDCH is a more than appropriate venue. It is very modern inside and out and as such a bit confusing. The best way to find your way around is by door numbers. They are in small print on top of every door and also printed on the tickets.An often overlooked part is the garden outside. We always bring a picnic before the concert. If you don't want to go through the trouble, get one at the Patina restaurant in the first floor and take it out. No need to sit in the dark to eat as everyone does.As far as seating goes, there is really no bad seat. The balcony is cheapest, but also far away. If you don't mind seeing the back of the orchestra and still want a good deal, get the seats behind the orchestra. Otherwise the Terrace seats are a good compromise as well.As for technicalities, there is ample parking beneath the concert hall at very reasonable rates ($9) and the concert is easily accessed from the highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalSll
50,Count Bassie Orchestra,"The music was great both old melodies and Christmas favorites.A great venue, I do not think there is a bad seat in the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrmrsmichaelc
50,A Beautiful Venue for Classical Music,"Disney Hall is truly a gorgeous work of architecture, and also a wonderful venue for music. It is uniquely shaped, offering very different angles of experiencing music. You can sit behind or beside the Orchestra. The sound is fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanM1234567
50,One of the best free tours in LA,"I've been here several times for concerts but going on a guided tour has made me discover new hidden spots at this fabulous place. Did you know there's a dispensary for cough drops for concert-goers who may have an itchy cough? This is just so to prevent them from coughing when the orchestra is playing. How very thoughtful, I say! Highly recommend going on a guided tour with an actual guide instead of a audio self-guided tour. You get to hear interesting stories from the tour guide. Love it! And go on a concert if you can, the concert hall itself (not covered during the tour) is pretty neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linaspiration
50,Morning visit,"Visited in the morning, when there was no concert. Spacious seats and lovely decoration. Suitable for concert lovers. The outside all covered with stainless panels is just fantastic to look at, I wish there was more space across the street to sit and enjoy this marvellous image for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek
50,One of the best concert halls in the world,"Wow -love, love, love this place. If you are a lover of classical music, then you must come to a concert here, it is truly a magnificent concert hall. This is one of our favorite things do in Los Angeles. The acoustics are great, and it is a privilege to attend a concert here. One of the great bargains is to sit behind the orchestra facing the conductor. It is a unique experience and you get to watch the conductor conducting and see how he interacts with the members of the orchestra. You begin to see how each conductor has a different relationship with the orchestra. The acoustics are not as great sitting behind the orchestra as the percussion is right there and tends to overpower the other members. If you prefer a more balanced sound, sit elsewhere, although we do recommend sitting here for at least one concert as it is a unique experience and very interesting to face the conductor. There is a cafeteria of sorts at Disney Hall but we are not fond of it as the dining area is not particularly nice -you feel like you are sitting in a big hallway and it just doesn't feel enjoyable. Regardless, be certain to visit. The building was designed by Frank Gehry and is quite an architectural showcase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravelersJD

50,This concert hall is out of control!!!!!!,"The stunning and profoundly designed ""Walt Disney Symphony Hall"", is a force to be reckoned! Obviously, Architect Frank Gehry, was thinking of ""Fantasia""! When Mickey was directing his orchestra, this building, is the movement, personified! The lighting, interiors, and, the show stopping façade, are the fabulous back- drop to the amazing and talented orchestras and symphonies, that play!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eventsbythirteen
50,Not A destination point..,"A beautiful extra modern sculpture building is a point to see.. Tours are available if the interior and a explanation of the boulding..DO NOT drive a great distance just to see it by it self... Lot of things in the area to combine with a visit to it. (Grand Central Market, Bradbury Building, Angle Flight, China Town)UNLESS you are lucky enough to get tickets to a concert or oyher performance... Then go for sure.Interior is anything but what you might expect.. beautiful multi balcony seating that exposes all side of the performance to the audiance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassV8048IT
50,A Magnificent Venue!,"This is the preeminent venue for concerts and chorale performances in the greater Los Angles area. It is a beautiful structure, designed by Frank Gehry, with excellent acoustics. We attended the Messiah Sing-a-Long and found everything about the venue to be outstanding. There is easy access to the upper seating, with both escalators and elevators. There are many helpful ushers providing programs and directions, and everything is immaculate. Probably the only complaint one might have is that the line for the bar during intermission was inordinately long. (I've noticed this at other concert venues, as well.) There is plenty of underground parking, which is a great convenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449dalew
50,Frank Gehry you have done it again--LA style!,"We LOVE Frank Gehry architecture and I think the Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of his best. There are nooks, crannies and commentary about special aspects of this building that are worth exploring inside and out from the actual concert seating to the outside views and gardens. Whatever it costs to enter, make sure a visit here is on your LA sites list. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007

50,Architectural Wonder,"We went to the Disney Concert Hall to hear the Los Angeles Master Chorale perform. This venue is so beautiful, inside and out. It's definitely a must-see. The staff are very friendly and willing to assist you. Just be aware that some seats have zero leg room which makes sitting for a long time very uncomfortable. Despite that, it was a thrill to visit the Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRO_13

50,One of the most photographed buildings in LA - for a good reason,"Frank Gehry's masterpiece, the WDCH is an unbelievably creative building amongst the muck of LA civic architecture, which pretty much stinks. The acoustics are excellent, too. Hear a concert, or just go to gawk - the building appears to float above Grand Avenue. Beautiful garden at the top of the stairs, nice cafe, and great experimental theater - REDCAT - underneath the hall (on 2d Street). Combine this visit with one to the Broad and to MOCA and you've got your culturati badge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suesinla
50,"Great Space, Great Music","Came here for a variety of different events from philharmonic concert to a modern ballet performance, to a cultural music show. It's amazing. There is no bad seat in the house. We were sitting in the ""nosebleed"" section once and you can hear the ruffles of the conductor's page turning. The acoustics are amazing. Love the small and intimate feel of it, and the exterior is so gorgeous. Lots of people take engagement photos here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saikoxpooh
50,Not just hype,"If you are in Los Angeles for a visit, you should definitely squeeze in a concert at the Disney Concert Hall. Yes, it's a beautiful and cool building, and yes there has been plenty of hype about it since it opened, but it lives up to it. A tour of the building is nice, but even better is attending a concert. The acoustics are amazing, and all of the seats are great. Try to catch the LA Philharmonic--you can find reasonably priced tickets, and it's a great way to experience the concert hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FussyGrl

50,"LA Phil, Dudamel, Gehry...the stars shine on","Gehry's architecture is exotic, and it doesn't look like a mountain, but when you go inside it to hear the LA Phil play under Dudamel's direction, you feel that you have reached an absolute summit of orchestral performance. Tip: those who arrive at least 45 minutes early on opening night can hear a lecture about the program that is very worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drwtwilner

50,Intriguing building with perfect acoustics,"Located adjacent to the older Music Center of Los Angeles, the Disney is best as a music venue but also can be visited as an architectural and landscape treat. One can walk around without a guide, visiting all the intimate areas that the unusual structure creates. There are many patios and gardens tucked in and around the building on several levels. There are self guided and docent guided tours. The cafe' is OK and the gift shop has great items.As a rainy day activity, only if you get seats to a concert. The tour is an outdoor activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anacarolina
50,Excellent concert hall,In late November I took my mom to see the LA Phil in concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. What a fantastic venue.

30,Good for Music...Not for Performers,"The exterior of the Walt Disney Concert Hall is it's most interesting architectural feature. Inside is bland and boring. Monochromatic walls and carpet, and not a single adornment. For a palace for the arts it is noticeably, and sadly, bereft of any further embellishment, color, texture, or challenge to the senses. The hall itself is a very deep and narrow bowl with a tiny stage.There are a few rows of seats to the sides and behind, which is quizzical since it is not designed for ""in the round"" performances, but the mezzanine and balcony seats are far, far away from the action. And being up so high, and with heat rising, the mezzanine where I sat was uncomfortably warm. The balcony people must have been unbearably hot. The air movement is poor, obviously, and to see a performer on stage you need at least opera glasses if not small binoculars. I wouldn't be surprised if balcony seats were a hundred yards away from the stage. The famed acoustics were not apparent for singer Kristin Chenoweth who used powerful microphones and a piano player who had even more power and drowned her out on several occasions. I suppose an instrumental ensemble's notes will drift upward and bounce off the many angled walls to the ear's delight, but I'll listen at home in a much more comfortable environment for a lot less money. As much as concert halls can be compared, this one was disappointing. Go with lowered expectations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgY8891TF
50,Fantastic music venue,"Best acoustics ever. Frank Gehry did a wonderful job and the LA Phil has never sounded better. And you can visit the Broad Museum across the street, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3106XUsusanh
50,Spectacular concert venue,"An epic Los Angeles landmark with incredible acoustics and stunning architecture. There is nothing ordinary about this Frank Gehry (an LA original) masterpiece. From the metal clad exterior to the mesmerizing interior (go ahead, try to find a rectilinear intersection!), your eye will be seduced by this sculptural space. Then when you find yourself transported by a sublime melody (hopefully you get a chance to see frenetic Gustavo Dudamel leading the LA Phil) you will realize that this space is also as spectacular for the ears as it is for the eyes. Don't miss hearing world class musicians play in a world class venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/956tedt
50,Amaizing architecture,You need to see the architecture of this building. It looks like waves as a surfer's paradise. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpmessier
50,One of the greats.,"Don't let the name or the glitzy Frank Gehry architecture get in the way--this concert hall is one of the greatest on the planet, and home to one of the nation's outstanding orchestras. Acoustics are splendid, sight lines are perfect from anywhere in the auditorium, and even the ventilation is great. We've heard everything from chamber music to Shostakovich in this hall, with vocal and instrumental soloists, and Disney Hall handles all of them well. The building is also great fun to explore, and there are excellent snacks in the ground-level cafe and bar. The garage--ordinarily a $9 flat fee on concert nights--is a relative bargain and well-run, but you can also reach Disney Hall easily by Metro's subway and bus lines and downtown ""DASH"" loop buses. Best of all, of course, is the L.A. Philharmonic, under its brilliant young conductor, Gustavo Dudamel. Concerts are smart, audiences usually attentive and pleasant, and the atmosphere is never stuffy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lit-traveler
50,I loved this tour,"The self-guided audio tour was very well prepared, detailed and included most of the interior work as well as the outside roof garden. It was fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katka130
50,"Wonderful Sound, Great Sightlines.","We were very impressed with the Disney Center. There were so many things to do there, even if you were not attending a concert. The gift shop had a wide variety of merchandise. Did not try the food in the cafeteria, but our companions had sandwiches and drinks from the snack bar in the lobby that they said were tasty. Bathrooms were large and plentiful. Many halls require one to stand in line for the entire intermission just to use the facilities. That is not the case at Disney. Parking was also easily accessible and did not require one to run a gauntlet of panhandlers and blocked sidewalks to get to ones vehicle. The pre-concert talks held in a separate lecture hall made it possible to actually hear the speaker without a lot of distorted sound. Escalators moved people between floors so we were actually able to move easily into and out of the auditorium. Once in the auditorium the raking allowed us to view the stage instead of the backs of heads and the sound was perfection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maevilyn
50,Beautifull venue and wonderful acoustics!,Saw Kristin Chenoweth last night. Sold out so we had what is called Orchestra View behind the stage. Maybe 100 or so seats. Only $46 and on paper this seems like a good place to put people that couldn't get a regular seat but we saw her back nearly the whole time although she tried to make sure we were included by turning around often. Acoustics fabulous and love the architecture. Easy access for Uber to pick up and drop off. I would love to go again and sit facing the stage next time! :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniedutch13
50,Stunning!,"I was mesmerized by the architecture of this building alone. Frank Gehry's creation does not disappoint. Then, I went inside and was fortunate to see a chamber music performance - the sound was superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954kathleenc

40,Great tourist spot in Downtown los Angeles,Recently visited this to show my cousin the hall. Parking was a bit of a challenge but manage to find a spot to take pictures of my guest with the hall as a background. Nearby parking will cost $10.00+. The best view is from Grand Avenue facing north but the 1st street is good but with lots of vehicular traffic. Weekends will be busy so try midweek.Recommended for ist timer to downtown Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butchrey
50,Music and Architecture in perfect harmony,"One of my favorite venues. Parking is $9 and directly under the Hall and elevators whisk you straight onto the ground floor of the hall. There are informational tours that start an hour before the performance led by docents that are very knowledgeable about the history and architecture. Tours last 30 minutes. The cafe is good but expensive, as are the bars that serve snacks and drinks. You can place an order ahead of time to pick up your drink at intermission, thus skipping the long lines.I've picked up terrace seating for a Joshua Bell recital for under $60. The row was quite cramped, you have to stand to let people pass you, but I still loved the view and the price. And the acoustics are amazing. Don't pass up any concert, recital, or performance here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiscozyskull
50,Architectural Masterpiece,"This lyrical structure continues to dominate the Grand Avenue location, despite the new buildings that have popped up around it. It is truly a magnificent architectural gem, up there with great buildings of the world. It glistens in the sun and beckons to take you on its interior journey. A must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,Majestic Evening,"There's no place in the world quite like the magnificent Walt Disney Concert Hall. Its stainless steel exterior is hard to miss from the streets, and this iconic landmark is easily one of the finest music venues in Los Angeles.My first time at WDCH was in November 2007 to see harpist Joanna Newsom. I remember walking in the building, my wandering eyes wide opened with a smile glued to my face as I tried to consume every precious moment. The amphitheater itself has tones creating a sense of warmth and comfort, yet, it's still embodies so much sophistication and class. I sat in my comfortable seat eager with anticipation. Then - the music began. There were no crazy special effects that you see in many performances today, as this would distract from the talent. Instead, everything was calm, and allowed the ear to focus on the brilliant acoustics created by each individual instrument in the room. The sound is crystal clear, allowing the listener to feel a sense of intimacy as if you're very close to the stage, regardless of your seat location.Seeing any artist at the Walt Disney Concert Hall is such a privilege, and I can't wait for the many shows I'll be seeing here for years to come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydlovestravel
50,Immortal Beethoven and Stunning Architecture,We had the pleasure of hearing Gustavo Dudamel conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and Simon Bolivar orchestra with the Master Chorale in a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. It was monumental and unforgettable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violettini
50,The reason I went to Los Angeles,I wanted to see and hear Gustavo Dudamel conducting in this concert hall. My husband and I heard Beethoven's Ninth Symphony performed by the Los Angeles and Simon Bolivar orchestras with the LA Master Chorale. Having also just seen the Frank Gehry exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) we were immersed! It is a gorgeous hall. a wonderful evening!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VKO1033
40,Architecture buffs must see it,"This place can be experienced at three levels. First, the free outside viewing, is a must. The outside structure is so curious and interesting that you can explore it for an hour. Second, the docent led tour inside, is only medium, because there's not that much to see unless you get inside the performance hall that's not included in the free docent tour. Third, is the performance hall ... and the best way to see that is to buy a ticket to a performance. This space is beautiful, its acoustics excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrasticTraveler
50,A Great Venue With A Stunning Design,A wonderful venue for the arts in downtown Los Angeles. The theater itself hosts numerous presentations and provides a stunning venue for all. The outside architecture is stunning and memorable. Free tours are available during the day,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
50,Stunning building,Off to LA for a conference...little enthusiasm! Oddly the conference hotel was downtown LA. I recall my internal groan. HOWEVER over the past few years they have been beautifying this old tired city. With stunning results. The Walt Disney Concert Hall (and more) is one of the most spectacular concert halls I have had the pleasure of viewing from the outside and from the inside. I heard the LA philharmonic with Gustavo Dudamel. Nothing short of breathtaking. The wood and seating inside the hall is beautifully finished. The sound wonderful. The organ....well look at the pics. They say it all. I returned three times for shows and to look over the building and rooftop garden. If visiting California (not just LA) drop in! All to watch Dudamel is an experience on its own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eremitoexplorer
40,"A must drive by, or quick stop even if you dont have tickets.","Try to get tickets it's a great venue, but even if not, it's worth a visit.

50,Amazing night out!,"The acoustics are incredible and not a bad seat in the house! Truly a must go-to venue. Go early and have dinner, it's a really nice area to walk around.

30,One major flaw,"A great venue! A spectacular concert hall with great acoustics. The views were wonderful. The negative, and a major one, is the limited space between the front of one seat and the back of the seat in front of it. We'd return if in LA and the program was exceptional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petetom

30,A steep hot hike up Bunker Hill,"Yes, the building is architecturally different & unique so I guess it was worth the hike up Bunker Hill on a Saturday afternoon while visiting downtown Los Angeles. But, don't expect to see the concert hall interior as it is rarely open for public viewing due to rehearsals etc. & tours are booked for over a year in advance per the staff on hand. The cafe was closed so we couldn't even get a cold drink but we did enjoy the air conditioning to cool off before we headed back down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debenfl

50,Great self-guided tour,"Disney Hall is a gorgeous building and it's worth taking the self-guided your. You sign up right in front of the gift shop, you get one of those wands with headphones and you're off. NOTE: The tour does NOT go inside the music auditorium, which is disappointing, but the rest of the building is incredibly gorgeous, so it's still worth the visit.You go up and through the interior, then end up on the roof, where there's a gorgeous garden. (I've lived here for 14 years and never knew there was a rooftop garden!) The guide recording is simple and easy to follow -- you're directed to various points of the building that are numbered and signage is clear, so you'll never feel lost. There are also employees posted at various points of the tour if you have questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lillehammer09
50,LA Phil is always Fine,"The LA Philharmonic is one of the finest orchestras in the world, and there's no better place to see them than at their home base in downtown LA.Designed by Frank Gehry, the Walt Disney Concert Hall is an unorthodox experiment in design and acoustics, providing a musical experience like non other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannyrogue
50,Wonderful Venue,This a must visit. This hall has no equal in architectural style and creativity. It boggles the mind as the building comes into view as to how they built it moreover than designed it.The concert hall itself has a different feel all together with curving wood paneling lacing the walls and ceilings. The accoustic are a wonder to behold.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelidecovolo
40,A good concert experience,"The Disney Concert Hall has a unique, very impressive exterior and an attractive interior, although the signage is decidedly poor and it can be difficult to find your way around. Views from anywhere in the auditorium appear excellent and the acoustics are also excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itraveller1000
40,An architectural gem,We spent an hour walking around the outside of this unusual building. It's got a lovel hidden park like area all round it with seats and walking amongst the paths you turn each corner and see another amazing view of this building which is completely different from the last. You can climb steps up and around the top of the building too and get great views of the area. We parked in a parking garage nearby which was very expensive so try and park on the streets and pay the meter instead because you only need an hour and it must be half the price we paid.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sasagnew
50,Beautiful building with amazing acoustics,I had the pleasure of seeing a concert at the Walt Disney concert hall and it was truly such a memorable experience. The acoustics were suberb and there seemed to always be a slight pleasant breeze at all. Times. The architecture and design of the interior really makes the experience one of a kind! Be sure to arrive early- at showtime doors will he closed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisonl994
50,Acoustics are stunning,"It simply cannot be said too many times. The acoustics in this hall are simply stunning. I attended a chamber concert last night and each instrument, each note was crystal clear. (Performances were just grand as well.) If you have the opportunity to hear something by the Los Angeles Phil in this wonderful concert hall don't pass it up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanneKH
40,Unique L.A. Musical Experience,"Attending a musical performance at the L.A. Disney Concert Hall should be on everyone's agenda when visiting Los Angeles. Aside from the striking 21st century appearance of the building's exterior, the ambiance of the interior as well as the musical acoustics are first calibre. When planning your visit to L.A., set aside the time to enjoy and purchase tickets in advance for a really memorable, quality musical experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rafiSoCal
50,Beautiful!,"A true beautiful piece of architecture.We walked around the building and took in the gorgeous fountain and views.We then took the tour inside, along with the audio pack - it was fascinating and very beautiful.Would recommend visiting if you have the chance, although parking is a bit of a hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliciaInfinite
50,FABULOUS! you must go. The accoustics are outstanding,I went to the opening of the LA Symphony with Dudamel. It was borderline life-changing. Maybe one of the best in the world. It is nice to get there early to walk around the building to truly take in the beauty of the architecture. I have heard symphonies all of the world and the sound quality is one of the best. No question.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramM8267TX

40,Stunning Design,"What a great building, this wasn't on our itinerary but its was in the 30's we were enticed in by a sign for a free tour and we were so glad that we did. We took a free self guided tour which took just over an hour, you follow a well signposted route and its impossible to get lost. We got to see inside the concert hall which is not usually open and if we had more time it would have been great to have attended a concert and experienced the full effects. The outside is just as interesting but don't touch the metal skin as in 30 degree temperature its very hot. We loved the fountain in the garden made from broken delph pottery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandJonathan

20,Interesting Architecture,"We had a quick walk through of this place which would be interesting for people who enjoy the arts and modern architecture. I found it spectacular but strangely soul-less.I'm a fan of the Sydney Opera House in Australia and thought that this building was maybe a bit of a try-hard.Plus, I really hated the carpet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishb764
40,The concert hall is a stunning piece of architecture,Inside the concert hall the symphony performance space is beautiful and a wonderful place for the LA Philharmonic to perform,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtraveledSeattle
50,This is *the* Los Angeles Cathedral,"We've been to several concerts here and never disappointed by the experience. The interior of the concert hall is superb, both visually and aurally. The exterior is fabulous, and you can reach interesting places from the inside.For concerts, we've been in terrace seats facing the stage, but also once on the side, almost even with the front of the stage. That side-terrace experience was extremely good in terms of our ability to see the conductor and the performers and to hear the music. I highly recommend trying those seats if you can.Before many (possibly all) LA Phil concerts, there is a lecture (so at 7:00 for an 8:00 concert). It's free and in my experience is always usefully informative. And it will get you to the main event on time so you aren't one of those late arrivals disturbing everybody by clomping in after the first movement. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/originalcurmudgeon
50,Spectacular architecture,I've only been to one concert inside and one outside. We also attended a brunch that was outside the concert hall. What a backdrop. Inside and out the architecture is spectacular! And they gift shop has items at all price levels so fun for all. Well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lkstumm
40,A 2nd & 3rd Of Beethoven At The Disney Concert Hall!,The best place in town to hear Beethoven! I love the Hollywood Bowl because I love the outdoor venues. But this one is beautiful outside and inside! I sat in the upper right balcony of the orchestra. The view and sound was perfect! One customer was upset because I was humming along with the music without even realizing it! The small café was cute and had indoor or outdoor seating. The sandwiches and salads and fresh vegetables are really good! Parking is reasonable right below the venue which avoids the downtown parking problem. Helpful ushers! Gustavo Dudamel Artistic Director was great! Don't forget the free program! Have the house wine and enjoy!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw353

50,Stunning from every elevation with great vistas out into the Downtown area and a serene garden,"We only had enough time to enjoy this beautiful building from outside so can't comment on the interiors. We weren't lucky enough to enjoy a concert this trip.The WDCH is easily accessible by public transit - we used the red metro line.We walked and climbed around all sides of the building particularly enjoying the glorious shady gardens on the second US level. After we had finished we want to the cafe to have a leisurely late lunch, but please note - the cafe closed at 2 pm on a weekday afternoon.It is so true that quality will be remembered long after price is forgotten! It seems there were both time and cost blow outs in building this splendid building, but like our Sydney Opera House it is iconic - and you can't put limits on that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyTeviot

50,AMAZING!!!,"My wife and I had a few great seats to see Chris Cornell at the Disney. We have been there one other time but did not write a review then for some reason. We had third row seats at stage left near the end of the row. Though we were at the end of the row the view was spectacular. Chris Cornell for those that do not know him was the lead singer for Temple of the Dog, Soungarden and also AudioSlave and this was an acoustic set.This room is just incredible. The sound is just perfect. You can just hear how good it is as soon as you walk in. The designers of this hall knew that it would be used for acoustic music including Chamber Music and that makes filling a good sized room with quality sound a challenge. Their design is a home run without compromise. Chris' voice sounded really good and the room makes you feel that you are in a very small venue and that the artist is playing just for you. That is how good this hall is.You just need to see a show here, period. What ever your type of music this is the best hall that you will be able to experience it in.Oh and not to sell anything short the interior/exterior and architecture make this building a a landmark location and even just visiting the facility is worth the time. The organ surround artwork is stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powdercoater

We didn't get to see the performance area because they were practicing. My husband mentioned he wished they'd at least let us peek inside. The audio tour is OK. It was free! Our favorite part was the garden and the beautiful fountain to honor Mrs. Disney.The bad thing though is the aerial walkway during a hot sunny day! It's like entering an oven. Seriously. And you'll need sunglasses. It's skippable though. There's a nice gift shop.Nice, clean bathrooms. Go up to the 27th floor of City Hall to see a great view of it from above!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moonslice

50,"A remarkable venue, inside and out!","We are Los Angelenos with musicians in the family, and we've been to many concerts and theatrical performances over the years. The Disney Concert Hall is a truly remarkable experience --- from ease of parking (but always be prepared for traffic and/or construction on the way and in that area), to ease of accessing the Hall itself from the parking area (a quick escalator ride up), to finding your seat and enjoying amazingly artists. We typically do dinner downtown first, and the dining options close to the Hall are plentiful. However, there are also few restaurants/take-out options on the first floor of the Hall itself, as well as an often crowded bar area.Once you enter the performance space, there is much to see, as it's a unique design with steep, raked seating --- this makes it a more intimate experience than you'd initially expect. Some performances include screens for a visual component, some do not. Even if there is no screen, there is always plenty to see.The acoustics are remarkable in this venue. With regard to seating, if attending an L.A. Phil performance, I prefer one of the seats on the side in order to be able to observe the conductor. You won't regret it! Dudamel is a study in musical artistry, so passionate and exciting to watch. However, even if seated in front of the stage and further back, the raked seating still keeps you close enough to appreciate and enjoy what's happening on stage. This is my favorite venue for musical performances!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7272PMjaneb
50,Stunning,An absolutely amazing building. Unfortunately we didn't have time to do the inside tour but walking around the exterior was terrific. The wavy stainless steel structure was fantastic and I loved the sculpture made from mosaics created from Mrs Disney's willow patterned crockery set,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outandabout1208
50,"MUST SEE, even if you have to make a special trip to downtown LA.","I had been in Gerry's Guggenheim. I had to see this even though I only had 15 min.(was downtown LA for business meetings all day, ran over at lunch break).I could not take a guided tour but the friendly young lady on the 1st floor told me to go to the 3rd floor to see the auditorium( which was open that day). I guess that it is not always available for public viewing.Upon entering, center farthest rear I felt as if I had entered a cathedral, and not just any cathedral but one that rivals the greatest one's in Europe.Then the organ started to play. I could feel the vibrations going through my close.I am not a religious person but I had a religious experience.I was told that because the organ is so overpowering that it has it's own concerts and is not used during other musical performances.If you can see any performance here, GO. If the organ is played pay anything to get to experience it.I was also told that they have the best theater for acoustics in the world. I believe it.The building itself is also a work of art...inside and out. It is harder to see the architecture here (inside) than the Guggenheim but you still can tell that the columns, walls and ceilings are not square.I would love to know how the design can be put on paper? I totally get a 3D model, but on paper?Go. Even if for only 15 min.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3johnb
50,The Gehry designed Hall and watching Dudamel perform,All angles of the building is gorgeous. Be sure to go upstairs to the outdoor garden dedicated to Mrs. Disney. We had seats behind the orchestra so we could watch Dudamel perform. It is amazing to see his energy has he conducts.

40,There's more then you think,"This a great place to see a performance, but what most people don't really know about this place is that it has a very quiet, tranquil hidden garden in the back. Great place to go at off hours and read a book or just enjoy the little hidden gem. Admire the flowers and trees behind the the auditorium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mh974
50,"Music, Sweet Music","If you're a tourist or a local, this is a must-do if you love classical music. I have just one warning -- if you have any fear of heights, don't sit on the side balcony, first row. Also, food is a bit of a problem, but you can walk a block to the Omni Hotel and eat at their casual restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citizenoftheworld
40,Music To One's Ears,Externally this is a unique structure - you could even say odd - but it's a lovely space and I had the distinct pleasure of attending a concert where 950 high school students joined in song - it was lovely.The Hall does offer self guided tours to get up close and personal with their stunning theaters and spaces. The tour takes you through the hall's history from conception to completion.If you're downtown anyway its a great way to spend an afternoon with friends and family.It's right by the courthouse and there is a metro stop nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LenaHollywoodMuse
40,"Perfect sound, tight seats","The hall is gorgeous, the sound is amazing. There is little legroom. If you are over 6' go somewhere else. You will be uncomfortable throughout the concert. The food is overpriced. The gift shop is fun and pricy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janejets0n
30,"Impressive to look at, bizarre to be in!","It cost millions, was designed by a world-renowned architect with some sterling credits, and took about 20 years to build - but the over-ambitious attempt to build something in steel and concrete resembling a budding flower is FRANKLY (! = pun intended) a mess. It does look fab from the outside, in a What On Earth Landed Here? sort of way; but the inside has some of the worst design I've ever experienced, and worse, the acoustics within are distinctly muffled…which was surely the whole point of building this venue?! Best thing I can think to say about it is that the seats are comfy! Otherwise, prefer the now-ancient (by L.A. standards!) Opera House just up the road, in every way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EH517
50,Walt Disney Concert Hall is the best Concert Hall I have been to.,"I have attended many concerts at Disney Hall. I have sat in expensive and not so expensive seats. It is a marvel no matter where you sit. The last few concerts we sat in the portion that faces the orchestra from a position near the organ. We were behind and above the orchestra, looking at the conductor. Fantastic! The acoustics were the result of careful design...lots of wood surfaces that were moved till the sound was perfect. Tour the hall or attend a concert there. If you go to a concert, make sure to attend the pre-concert lecture, erudite lecturers who understand the performance and enhance your experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldLA

50,Architecture of genius,A truly extraordinary building. Every aspect has been thought about by Gehry. There's even a garden nestling in the structure. And inside I've never seen a concert organ that shape! We went on a day time tour - couldn't attend a concert because of our schedule - but next time I go to LA I will plan ahead better and hear something there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdW741

50,Go for the music but don't keep your eyes off the setting,"We went to a concert performed by the California Philharmonic at Disney Hall. It's hard to describe how fabulous this was.It seems that conductors are now taking on a new role. They no longer lead the orchestra in creating special pieces to entertain us, they also personally entertain the audience. Victor Veneer is no exception. You can tell that he loves what he does and he infects the audience with his wit and passion. The performance was Lights, Camera, Action -- pieces taken from various movies spanning several decades.Not only was the music a fabulous treat but the setting took my breath away. I couldn't take my eyes off the incredible angles and curves of Disney Concert Hall. It is stunning and added enormously to our experience.We had seats at the stage level, four rows back, at the center of the stage. The most incredible location you can imagine. In looking around I noted that there is likely not a bad seat in the house. All of the views and the acoustics appeared to be extraordinary. Our advantage was that we could see the expression on the faces of each member of the orchestra, what a treat!Check out the gift shop for wonderful books and recordings as well as other small trinkets.Bars are located throughout the lobby areas.Valet parking is available but we chose to park ourselves. Very convenient in the lower levels of Disney Concert Hall.just an elevator ride up to the lobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fro2

50,Affordable and Different Concerts - Green Umbrella,"Beyond the shining exterior, the sound quality of the hall is worth experiencing. A way to sit in the concert hall without spending bank is through the Green Umbrella series. John Adams has been creative director for the past few years. You might even see him conducting. This is New Music. Composed by a mix of young artists and avant garde, iconoclasts all. The hall responds well to this type of music. Uncharacteristic of most concert hall audiences, you may see patrons under 50 attending. It seems that there is one extravaganza per series season. One year it was a staging of Frank Zappa's 200 Motels complete with glow in the dark giant dildo weilding singers. Crazy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaTravels2014
50,"Must See For Visitors. Take the Tour, See a Concert, Enjoy the Hidden Garden","Gehry is, of course, one of the greatest architects of our times. Just one look at this building and his genius is confirmed. But what many do not know is that this building offers so much more than just a beautiful exterior.Any visitor to Los Angeles should most definitely take in any show that is playing at the concert hall for a chance to absorb the wonderful acoustic qualities of the building. For world and classical music, the Disney Concert Hall's sound is unmatched.Visitors can also enjoy a FREE tour to get a better understanding of the building.But perhaps the greatest part of the Disney Concert Hall is the hidden garden on the upper floor. As a Downtown LA resident I have spent many an afternoon in this beautiful space, relaxing, reading or enjoying a picnic lunch. The garden is a perfect escape from the hustle of the mid-city life. In fact, it transports you out of Downtown into a serene, ethereal world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilmEatDive
20,"Sound is wonderful, seats are awful","I attended one concert at the Hall and was in the nosebleed section. I could not really enjoy the event because there is so little leg room. I was in pain after a half hour and could not wait to leave. I have since talked to other friends that paid more for their seats and sat closer to the stage but they also complained about the leg room. I am not tall, 5'4"". Why in the world would one build such a hall and then pack it with uncomfortable seats and no leg room. Made plane leg room look luxurious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenamX8474OS
50,The Sound of Music at its best,Glorious sounds of a world class oerchestra. Pick a program of music you enjoy - most all concerts are a pleasure- I like the matinees.

40,"Enjoy the beautiful concert hall, avoid the rest of the building","The main concert hall is excellent- great views, wonderful acoustics, comfortable seats. The flowing lines alone are worth seeing, and it's clear Frank Gehry spent a great deal of time on its design. However, the rest of the building feels like an afterthought, especially when compared to the Dorothy Chandler. The meeting rooms, dining area, and even the lounges, feel somewhat phoned in- as if they were fit around the main concert hall by the rest of Gehry's staff (which they were.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgonzo
50,Cool Building and Amazing Acoustics,"The Frank Gehry building is an icon all its own. It's located in the north end of downtown LA and a must see in LA. You can tour the exterior and lobby without buying tickets to a concert there. I believe they also give interior tours when concert hall is dark.I live in LA and subscribe to the LA Phil and if you can go to a concert here, I would highly recommend it. The design of the concert hall itself is equally interesting and the pipe organ is one of the largest in the world (in terms of the number of pipes) and a very cool design as well. Try an organ concert here, you will literally feel the sound vibrate inside you when the pipes are fully open. The organ has a name ""Hurricane Mama"" or ""French Fries"" due to the design.If you come to a concert here, arrive early so you can enjoy seeing the building in daylight and watch how the setting sun reflects off the metal exterior and changes the look. At night, the building glows much more warmly. Don't miss the interior roof gardens, with some lovely garden sculptures and a meditation labryinth. As you walk, you also weave around the curvy exterior and see surprises around the corner.I find something new to enjoy about this quirky building every time I visit. An icon of LA and something we Angelenos are very proud of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvtoSafari

When first built the condo residents nearby pleaded for the shine to be toned down a bit because they were baking in their very expensive homes. It was and they are happy now. The acoustics of the hall are superb and they have a great SHOP with music related souvenirs. It is right beside the Dorothy Chandler Center (plays operas and musicals) with a large and beautiful multi pointed fountain which rises and fall,and changes color all at different intervals.

I highly recommend your going at least once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dqueen1
50,BEST Indoor Acoustics in Los Angeles,"While I'll confess to not totally get the architecture, I do appreciate the talent that designed it. That being said, like it or not, what is absolutely evident is that this is a superior venue in which to enjoy music. There are a variety of shows/types of music you can find here throughout the season, but no matter your taste, your ears and eyes will LOVE this place! I've been here a few times, but my favorite was listening to Dudamel conduct the symphony playing Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker. No ballet, just the music. I adore the ballet, but this was an opportunity to just focus on the music, which is incredible.No matter...go and feast your ears. There really isn't a bad seat in the house!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hugs4u
10,Tear it down,A pile of metal junk. Gets raves bacause it's a Ghery bldg(his style). The Getty which is beautiful and made with elegant materials will still be here in the.future. I bet Walt Disney hall will be gone or more of a pile of junk. The metal causes hot glare on the bldg. across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/schulo310
50,Awesome place!,I love the Disney Concert Hall. My family and I saw Gustavo Dudamel several times with the LA Phil. Great show and nice location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariea285
50,Great date night!,"If you're looking for a great date night in Los Angeles check out the Walt Disney Concert Hall. At this point, it's an iconic venue. The building is world famous and the sound is beyond amazing. Go listen to some music. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyCali74
50,"Wow, architects triumph!","What an amazing architectural feat! Inside and out, curved lines and astonishing burnished stainless steel that are an engineering marvel. Every turn, every angle, every aspect a treat for your senses. And the main hall itself - unbelievable! 10/10!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanGeelong1
50,Stunning,"Fascinating building, great to outwardly admire but well worth taking the regular (and free) docent tour. They are very proud of what they have - and why wouldn't you be. Hard to think of a better use of an hour in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucienOSS
50,Gorgeous,"This is a beautiful building, a fabulous concert hall, and a cultural experience. Whatever performance you catch here is going to be far better than it would anywhere else, just by virtue of the incredible acoustics, but there is so much more. The roof top garden is a peaceful mecca in the hear of LA, offering unique views, while the lobby restaurant provides an opportunity to enjoy a light meal before a performance. Every part of the interior is spacious, and offers a visual experience that sets the tone for the performance. At times soothing, at others exciting, the structure itself is a part of the cultural experience, enhancing the music, while not distracting from its beauty. Bonus: The parking is exceedingly convenient, and not as pricey as other LA venues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970ralphs
40,Beautiful,"This building is quite simply breathtaking, make sure it's on your list of places to visit. Even if you're not visiting for the music make the trip to see the superb aesthetics of the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moscow75
50,More than Just a Pretty Exterior,"Disney Hall first grabs you with its Frank Gehry signature exterior of crumpled paper rendered in metal and glass. Once inside you're treated to more visual splendor but more importantly amazing acoustics.With so many modern music venues failing to meet the standards of old venues--the Vienna Opera House and Konzert Hause come to mind--Disney Hall is a great place to see and a great place to close your eyes and hear truly hear, the music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathand666
50,Very Nice!,"A scenic architecture, a nice program (Cal Phil & Beetle Mania performed Beethoven Sym No. 7 and the Beetles hits - very entertaining), easy parking, and good location for us (we were heading to Little Tokyo after the concert, which was at a walking distance). The inside of the concert hall is as awesome as the outside - Unlike the metallic & modern outside, the inside is has very warm and colorful atmosphere. Our seats were in the first row of Terrace East. You can hear every instruments very clearly, and the view was good, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairecN9259JC
50,"Beautiful, great design, terrific accoustics","Loved the symphony and the ambiance. A treat to go there, and side high up seats are great, much less expensive than orchestra (and can see very well!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanAda2015
50,"Don't know about the inside, but the outside is great","Of course I'd seen photos of the Gehry exterior (and loved it). What they don't convey is the extraordinary relationship to the surroundings. It's not a monolithic building plonked on a street. There are external walkways that weave around and give you amazing views of the surroundings and glimpses of the interior.I haven't seen a concert here, so don't know about the concert hall itself, but would definitely recommend visiting it to walk around and enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G9634GDdavidg

50,Unbelievable.,"We took the free tour of the building that was build by Frank Geary. It was incredible how the inside is different from the outside. If you are an architecture buff, you must see this building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elisnv
50,Impressive building & sound,"Home of the LA Philharmonic, and the Los Angeles symphony this place is a gorgeous architectural landmark in downtown LA. The design by Frank Gehry is astonish and unique ... just like or hate it; I love it. Its a modern masterpiece of architecture that will last for hundreds of years. A steel vision with no straight line on the interior.The superior acoustic makes you believe that you were sitting on stage in the middle of the orchestra ... great views of performers as well as the whole interior.Of course there is a gift shop and if you have time don't miss the gardens on the terrace outside behind the Hall. Is also really charming and a nice surprise walking around the exterior; this can keep photographers busy throughout the day shooting fabulous images as the light shifts every hour.So don't miss this magic place ... look, listen and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coutito
50,A beautifull piece of architecture!,"An orgy of disordred metal reminding of a sailing ship, in full contrast however in peace with the relaxing wooden interior and lushing garden. A masterpiece! We saw the Beiijng concert hall two weeks ago and they a very different and both world class!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78micheld
50,Great sight lines and acoustics,"Disney Hall is an architectural marvel. The sight lines are good from anywhere; the acoustics are perfect. The seating is not so straightforward--ask an usher for help, on every level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tenighir
50,Stunning,"A simply stunning work of architecture and engineering both inside and out. They offer a free audio tour, which is very interesting, and sometimes you can go inside the impressive concert hall itself. Definitely worth the stop and taking in a concert would also be great if you have the time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikekowalczyk
50,Amazing Performing Arts Venue!,This place has to be the most gorgeous performing arts venue (inside & out) I have ever been to in my life! The architecture is impeccable. There was obviously a lot of attention paid to detail when this place was built. It's unique in the fact that there are seats available on every side of the stage. I really don't think there's a bad seat in the house. I can't wait to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,This is stunning,"I had no idea that you can climb through the twists of metal outside of this building, or of the contrast of the atmosphere in the rear of the building. So happy we walked and spent the time exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyBMarlton
50,Frank Ghery at his fruitiest,"Wonderful to visit, with the nearby newly built Broad gallery. Both so very different yet approachable buildings to view. Go inside and be wowed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twins021
50,Amazing concert hall!,"My son had the honor of playing here with the Civic Youth Orchestra from San Diego. What a neat building with incredible acoustics.

40,happy new year in the Hall!,The acoustics were staggering here. And we toasted the new year with a glass of champagne at the restaurant downstairs. Magnifique.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oohlaalaa
50,Free Audio Tour,"We didn't attend a performance here, but we did do the free audio tour during the day. It was a fantastic tour! Lots of detail, and opportunities to learn more at different points if you were interested. It took you for a great tour walking around the whole building, the gardens are particularly lovely. Allow a couple of hours to take the tour and wander around and get some great photos of this beautiful building!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145gemmal
50,Concer Hall Cafe,"Surprisingly good lunch spot for a quick cheap bite. Cafe has a very good salad bar, clean, and quiet place to hang out. Just across the street from the Stanley Mosk courthouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonlight
50,A true architectural masterpiece!,"My husband and I unfortunately did not allow ourselves enough time to be able to attend a performance within this magnificent building, however, we spent some time taking in the amazing building that the Concert hall is, roaming around the gardens and taking photos from every which angle we could. The building itself is truly worth seeing in person as the architecture will not disappoint. Hopefully next time we'll be able to experience its acoustics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3N0
50,Frank Ghery!,Love to see buildings by Frank Ghery and the concert hall in LA doesn't disappoint. A number of other architectural fans stopped to snap pix while I was prowling the street for the best vantage points for good photos. Stunning to see in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddblue33
50,Perfect Acoustics!,"Anything can sound beautiful in the Disney Concert Hall. No time, just drive by and also go to the cathredal of the Angels down the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibumaven
50,Sublime!,"This Hall did the same thing as Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao. Who would have thought that an architectural building would have revitalised the whole area? Apparently, it did just that for Bilbao and Disney Concert Hall followed suit. I have visited this Concert Hall many times and at different time of the day. It's intriguing that the titanium panels are warm and that the Concert Hall looks very different every and each time. It's akin to the Impressionism work of haybales by Monet. There's a tiny garden at the rear of the Concert Hall, which is being used for events and conferences. The rear is probably not as outlandish as the front. In terms of architecture, Frank Gehry is truly a master. It's outrageous and yet, the flow and the layout are practical and efficient. I managed to read the book about the making of this Hall and as confirmed by many other reviewers, acoustic here is excellent. Frank Gehry worked very closely with sound engineer to derive the best sound from the Hall. Besides, the architect himself is a big fan of art installations and so, he's still proactive having himself involved in designing the sets for performances here. Talking about a living art work-in-progress, you truly can't beat this place. An icon for Los Angeles indeed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wiredfrog
50,Want some Culture?,"Hey, come any enjoy a concert here at Disney Hall, whether a one time visit or a subscription for the season. Excellent music venue, check out the website. The building alone is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swallowfield2015
40,Wonderful sound and beautiful environment as well as wonderful musicians. BUT terrible seating!,DISNEY HALL is a place where some of the most wonderful musicians and outstanding soloists come to perform. However if you are large with long legs opt for a aisle seat. It is very hard to get along the aisles because there is no foot room. So one must either stand up or the person going along the aisle must step over peoples feet!fI cannot understand why they didn't take into account how people could fit comfortably in this venue,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolineA705
50,If you get the chance to see a performance here- do it!,"I saw an acoustic performance here and it was outstanding! The sound was amazing, the venue is great too designed so thst the crown is spread around the many different common areas and parking was so easy.For our show we were sitting behind the artist which was no problem as the whole venue feels quite intimate and you are close to the stage.The seats can be a bit hard but if you sre lucky enough to be here hopefully you are not thinking about the seat because you are too engrossed in the entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7430BYsarahh
50,Stunning building,Came here with a few friends a couple of months ago and all I can is stunning. Unfortunately I have been to LA many times but this was only my first time. The architecture is spectacular both inside and outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277darlenef
50,Wonderful music,Beautifully done and I've been told that the acoustics is better then the Vienna Opera House. I don't think there's a bad seat in the house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
30,Cool building,"I didn't get to go inside as it was closed when I visited, but I was impressed with the look and design of the outside of the building. Even in the pouring rain, it was impressive. Will make sure that on my next trip to LA that I get to go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lois233

50,Breathtakingly Stunning!,"Its an absolute gem of architecture and engineering, but the public garden was the real treat, an oasis in the middle of the busy city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melonballx
50,all ears at this consummate Mouse House,"A recent concert of Ravel conducted by Dudamel was our excuse to buy tickets for the Walt Disney Hall. Although we are not Ravel fanatics, we wanted to see Gustavo conduct and we wanted to visit this concert hall ""in action"". Five star checks for both. The building is marvellous, and the acoustics are amazing -- La Scala sounds no richer to my (admittedly inexpert) ear. I have heard Bolero many times (who has not?) and this was the fullest, most sensuous reading of that piece in my experience, partly because of the acoustics and partly because of Dudamel's interpretation -- restrained exuberance. When every composition ended, the conductor signalled certain musicians in the orchestra to rise individually for applause. This was so thoughtful and generous on his part that you couldn't help but applaud him even harder.An added bonus to watch for: some performances are preceded by a one-hour talk about the program, free to ticket holders. Professor and radio personality Alan Chapman leads these mini-programs and they are well worth attending. He may interview the composer of a new work, or discuss the life of the headline composer, or a combination of the two.Parking is easy, right in the building. It flows easily after the show.The only negative: these are very expensive tickets. I ordered them by phone from the ticket office and when I was done, the functionary said, ""Thank you for your purchase. Now would you like to make a donation to the LA Philharmonic?"" ""Feels like I already have,"" was my reply.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParoleAnima
50,Unique architecture,What an amazing building! Beautiful architecture and typically helpful staff. Free audio tours. Impressed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N2365IVpeterw
50,Fantastic,"All the best praises and dithyrambos can't describe the incredible akusticos of this beautiful concert hall!!! It was said that this Hall is the best in the world - it is, believe me, even in compare with Albert Hall, Moscow concert halls, even opera houses in Wienna and Milano. And the Armenian State symphonic orchestra was just in place there and suited the hall. Excellent concert!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716venusp
40,Great orchestra and conductor,"Love Gustavo and his repertoire. Very professional orchestra. Greate hall, very warm and inviting. Heard rumors that acoustics are not the best, but love it anyway. Prices are connected to the quality so no complaints here. Love sits behind the orchestra. Very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Padbsk
50,Make sure you make time to attend a performance,"Excellent experience! The sound system is exceptional and acoustics are incredible. It is beautiful and out. The seats are comfortable for the most part but I thought the fact that I had the additional ""cushion"" of a sweater helped, as the performance I attended was",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sontrell
40,Nice Place,"Little expensive but really nice way to spend the day. Very family oriented, the food is ok but the place is pretty and the staff is super friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ViajerosCasados

Remember, the concert hall is just that, not an amusement park but a breathtakingly beautiful setting for the LA Symphony Orchestra.Go early to snoop around. Make sure to tour the attached gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TigerMama12
50,a big concert hall that gets it right,"the seats are comfortable, the guides helpful, the acoutics amazing and several lovely dining venues in the building. Heard the same musical piece by the same orchestra in 2 different auditoriums what a difference with Walt Disney Concert Hall. Also it is easy to exit the hall and go to your car. Why cant more halls be stunningly striking but so practical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinea750
50,My favorite building in all of Los Angeles,"Spectacular…inside and out. I've been regularly attending performances at Walt Disney Concert Hall since October 2003, and continue to be amazed by the breath-taking beauty of it, and the transcendent music created in it. A great gift to the City of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/convivial
50,Great experience,"We took a tour of the building were you can get to visit all the interiors and the roof, it is very interesting to see how all the pieces fit together both inside and out. Impressive architecture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaC629
50,Nice to look at but you must attend a performance,"The architecture of Disney Hall is quite interesting and is surpassed by the acoustics inside the auditorium. One can view the building from the street and walk around and inside public areas plus a small garden at the upper level but the visit is not complete without a performance. The hall was built for acoustic music and does not work well with amplified sound so plan if at all possible to see and hear one of the larger groups, the Los Angeles Phil, The Master Chorale or something similar. There are seats behind the stage if you want to see the conductor head on but I recommend the Orchestra section (third tier) for best view. I could go on and on about this place which I visit several times a year. Downtown L.A. has become a real city and the Music Center and County park across the street are the focal point of a lively venue. Bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pixer1
50,Excellent Docent-led Tour,"Had a great tour led by a docent. Didn't get to see all the theaters (some were in use), but saw most of them and got a neat overview of the history and design of the architecture. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnmmcd
50,Love it. Acoustics are great. Must see in LA.,"Amazing building. Comfortable. Decent food. However the Pinot restaurant is ridiculous in that it is closed after a concert. Defeats its purpose. Wood is incredible,architecture is incredible. A must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Restman18
50,A pleasure to behold,"We love to attend concerts here both for the conductor of the LA Phil, Dudamel, and the Frank Gehrey building. Every seat is great and the sound quality is magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richie54
50,Fabulous Venue,Everyone should experience a concert at Disney Hall at least once in their life. The outside of the building is breathtaking but you're in for an even better treat when you go inside. The acoustics are amazing! The seating is wonderful and there really is no bad seat in the house. The outside courtyard is a great place to spend intermission. Make sure to go early and check out the gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BThomas2218
50,Wonderful building!,"I have seen it only outside as I was there in the late afternoon on a day in which there were no performances planned, but it is a must-see in LA, if you love Frank O. Gehry architecture!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmanuelaDC
40,Beautiful Concert Hall,"We took the self-guided tour of the hall, which I've always wanted to do - and it was gorgeous. Absolutely stunning. Seeing it from the outside doesn't do the inside any justice whatsoever. They have beautiful gardens, the inside is light and bright...it's totally worth a visit. The tour itself is very informative, sometimes a little overly so, but I'm glad we took the time to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L8BarMom
40,Amazing but troublesome security,"We were walking around this amazing building from the outside, taking pictures and admiring its architecture when i put my hand touching one wall, and an officer yelled at me because i was not supossed to touch it. Very, very rude.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boojua

50,Wonderful achcitectural masterpiece in LA with terrific music offerings,"I have spent many wonderful evenings delighting in musical events from Dudamel and other stellar musicians/conductors. It is a delight to the eye and ear. Considering costs in other cities, prices can be reasonable for seats outside of orchestra.All seats will provide great listening but some seats not that comfortable- too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/450juditha
50,We practically helped play the timpani!,"We sat in the front row of a section of seats directly behind the orchestra during an LA Philharmonic concert. I could practically help play the timpani, it was so close. We also were directly in line with the French horn bells and just to the side of the powerful bass section. I loved every minute of it ... and I'm not sure I want to go back to sitting in front of the performers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JS859

50,Unbeatable acoustics,I love this place. There is not a bad seat in the place in terms of sightlines and the sound of any performance is unbeatable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbeavis
50,Stunning architecture,We took a free guided tour of Walt Disney Hall and the other three arts buildings. The docent was very well informed and gave us a terrific overview of the architecture and art of the buildings. It was well worth spending 1 1/2 hours touring the buildings. The free tours start at 10:15.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936christianew
50,Stunning architecture,"I was there early in the morning and I only walked around the outside of the building and took photos, as the building was closed. I was still very happy as I love this design and admire the works of Gehry. I have driven past once before when visiting Los Angeles and was desperate to have an up close look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrys821

40,Incredible Architecture,"If you're doing the downtown thing - Music Center, New Cathedral, MOCA then lingering on the sidewalk to take in the beautiful architecture of the Disney Center is a must. It is truly a work of art. I've been to two events inside - one a concert and the other a reception. Both were nice but I was a bit underwhelmed by the performance space. Still, it is a theater and I am a sucker for any performance space. Definitely, take the time to really look at the building before you pass it by. You won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
50,Water Passion and the Water Bar,"I love the Walt Disney Concert Hall, but yesterday it was mind blowing. They had the Water Passion concert with the Master Choral and before the show the caterer Patina had set up a Water Bar including a water sommelier. It was amazing to taste different waters from around the globe to see the difference in taste. Really a special experience.Thanks Patina to hydrate me in a very unique way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789susanns
50,Perfect acoustics and dramatic architecture,"If you go for a performance, acoustically there is no bad seat. The building, inside and out is worth a special trip if nothing is playing inside.Even the cafeteria is better than average, and frequently crowded. You can walk all around the building using a series of steps to get to the outside amphitheater, gardens, and city views. But the most moving aspects of the place are the wonderful angles and sightings that abound inside and out. Don't miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cos39
50,See a show--- Hear-Listen to a show here!,"Iconic building. Recognizable everywhere. Amazing acoustics.Not sure if the building is cooler at night with lighting or during the day reflecting heat and sunlight.I've been to the phil here. I came to see the incomparable Arlo Guthrie.Go to dinner nearby at the GCM and then hangout before the show. Of course, next door are the Chandler Ahmanson and Taper facilities.See a show here. Listen to a show here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Ok visit,We visited on a Monday and the tour guides do not work on Mondays. You can do a self guided audio tour but it was lacking something I felt. I also found it quite difficult to find my way around even with the Map do I did not complete all of the tour. Phone or email first before going to check when tour guides work to make the most of your trip. It was free entry but you need to pay for car park if you are driving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy22102
50,Art in Architecture,If you do not like Classical Music (and Maestro Dudamel will make you like it) just being outside the hall and taking in the incredible curves and reflections of the structure is worth it. But do get a ticket to a performance and enjoy the music and the finishes and depth of the interior.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
40,WALT DISNEY MUSIC HALL !!!!!!!,"Ithe Civic Center area of Los Angeles is one of the most remarkable buildings that you'll ever see where the LA Philharmonic performs across street the LA Opera and all the big and famous court cases at the courthouse, Area easy access off the Metro red line subway train from Union Station get off at Civic Center station first and Hill Street right down the street is the famous Grand Central Market where you can find the great food at great prices this area is serviced by the Omni Hotel Kawanda Hotel Doubletree Hotel and Miyako hotel walking distance to Little Tokyo only negative thing because of a government area the streets tend to be empty after 6 p.m. especially on Saturday and Sunday and doesn't get very busy until about after 10 a.m. so if you're a tourist and you're by yourself take note. Because you will be bumping into a lot of homeless people their shelters are past 3rd Street and below Main Street If you need free information check thetransportationgeneral.com for free bus and train routes for most of the major cities if you're lucky you probably catch a making a movie there well good luck",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertcV6096TO

50,Disney for Musicians,"A must see, fantastic architecture and wonderful accoustics. A tour would be wonderful, but getting tickets to a concert is perfect.

Be sure to walk all the way around the outside to really see the structure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodgirl123

50,great downtown afternoon,"Went on the self-guided tour. Park in the building. Free handsets and a walk about tour of three floors, then outside. Descriptions by the architect, project manager and landscape designer. Plan on a couple hours. Also have docent tours, and a wonderful LA Philharmonic gift store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenc67
20,Boring,"Architecturally beautiful place but boring , there is not really what's to come for just aimlessly .All beautiful building but beyond that I was not going back there .Oh there is also a beautiful sculpture garden of the structure of a rose .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909iditg
40,BEAUTIFUL PLACE,State of the art structure nicely located in the city attractions. wonderful experience of this concept walt Diseny style,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/engr_ehsan_elahi
50,The acoustics are absolutely amazing,"If there is any kind of concert the day you're in Los Angeles, really -- get a ticket and go. I'm pretty sure no matter where you're seated, the sound will be phenomenal. Yes, the architecture is stunning, go early so you can walk around and appreciate it. If you're hungry, drop by the cafe, which really does have pretty good food for cafeteria-style service. But the top reason to go is the sound. I've heard the LA Phil play, and I've heard solo pianists (Yuja Wang and Lang Lang) play, and for Lang Lang I was in the very last row of the balcony and even his lightest touch, even the highest notes on his right hand, I could hear clearly, achingly. I didn't miss a single thing, and that's simply not true for Davies in San Francisco, for Zellerbach or Hertz in Berkeley. Once you experience sound like that in a live concert, you won't forget it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardsmom24
50,must be experienced,"Stunning design, spectacular acoustics, excellent seating design. Plenty of parking underneath or catch a bus, train or Uber. Cafe food pretty good. Garden is delightful. Deservedly full last night for the visiting London Symphony Orchestra. Go to a concert and be proud of this arena.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/131paulinek
40,A Marvel,"The building is a work of art. Just missed the last tour of the day but wandered around on our own and that was enough to experience the wonder of this structure. Didn't have time to go back another day to get the tour but, saw and learned enough to know that when next in town, I will revisit and hopefully attend a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJK810
50,Beatuiful Shows,We came for a Christmas themed concert and I must say wow. It is an amazing experience just to try it out one time and you will see why it is a coveted spot here in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
50,Wow,Beautiful building in downtown Los Angeles with great views of the city from the catwalks. This is a free attraction and well worth the hike up Bunker Hill. Great view of the old City Hall building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Latta
50,Best Acoustics in a concert hall,Every seat in this theater has great acoustics. The sound is amazing. Mostly classical music concerts - it is the official concert hall for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Decorated inside with a Hawaiian motif - mainly because this was a favorite of Disney. The only negative is the seats don't have a lot of leg room so be sure to get an isle seat if you are tall.. Architecture by Frank Gehry to look like sails on boats - this is a definite 'MUST SEE and Experience' in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123DRDEAN
50,Audio gives excellent insight,"Our timing wasn't good for the docent-led tour, so we took the free audio tour. Hmmm... I can't recall the last time a facility like this offered such a tour. But what a great idea! The audio had the advantage that you could hear Frank Gehry and other key people explain what they did and why. Gave the whole place a more human and meaningful quality.A great achievement for Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucky_Eddie
50,Great free tour,Really breathtaking architecture. Offers everyday free tours (in group or by your self with audio guide) that is really great. Beautiful garden on top of the building with a wonderful view of downtown Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/repeating
40,Breathtaking architecture no matter what your vantage point,"I wanted so much to do the inside tour, however, I showed up 2 minutes after the last tour at 2 PM, and was unable to explore the interior. I have another reason to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardG310
30,Due to time I only got to photograph the outside,But I know from friends whose kids have played there that the place is exquisite. Architecture is amazing - all the curves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJAhearn
30,Have to see it once,"We took the free audio tour. The interior is of some interest but we could not even get a peek into the concert hall. In photos it's spectacular so this was a real disappointment.The exterior is great as is the garden.Visit if you have time. It was on our check list, we had time so why not???? If you only can chose a few things in LA, find something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAD10977
20,Bad Acoustics and Behind the Times Programming,"The much touted accoustics here don't live up to the hype. And the hype hasn't lived up to itself. I attended a rehearsal in 2014 at which someone asked Deborah Borda why the orchestra wasn't going to ""be miked,"" that is, to have microphones so that those attending the rehearsal might hear better. That question in itself says a lot. Borda's answer says even more: ""We don't want you to hear a disagreement between the orchestra and the conductor."" What? That's right. That says more than just that the accoustics are poor. Doesn't it? Unfortunately, although Esa Pekka Salonen did much to bring the orchestra into the twentieth century when this was his home, the orchestra remains ensconced in pop programming. In other words, the programming is not state of the art any more than is the accoustics. Instead, expect to hear standbys. Don't expect to hear the envelope getting pushed. There is a reason why Anne Sophie Muetter did not perform here a year or so ago and, instead, performed in a small venue in Northridge and also in San Francisco. There is a reason why, next season (Fall 2015), Portuguese pianist Maria Joao Pires won't play here and, instead, will play in San Francisco. Do yourself a favor. Enjoy good music elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinemm147
50,Dudamel fabulous concert,"I love the Hall which is spectacular and also the settings,spectators 360 degrees,the programJohn Adams City Noir and Dvorak 9 symphony was perfect and the tempo of the 9th made me rediscover this symphonyAnd we got an encore!The orchestra was vibrant",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoe646

50,Wonderful Arts Complex,"Confession: It's been more than a year since I was at Disney Concert Hall. But, I do remember it being a superb facility, good underground parking, cafes, wine bar etc, as well as great acoustics. Now, I am in LA for a few weeks I must try and go see something there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/what666
50,"If you like architecture, you'll love the Disney Concert Hall","Although both the LA Philharmonic and LA Chamber Music Ensemble play here, it's well worth doing the self-guided audio tour just to see and learn about the architecture of this iconic LA landmark. Finished in 2003. Majestic stainless steel design by acclaimed architect Frank Gehry. Don't miss the roof garden! Quite the wonderful cafe, too. I will always remember the magnificent arching columns of Douglas fir. An inspiring place. Filled with skylights. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanieC51

40,Deserves 5 stars if you could see the performance hall,"This is great, any way you cut it. The admission is free. The tour is interesting. The building is spectacular. The only thing missing is a look into the concert hall. Definitely worth an hour of your time. I would say it's the highlight of downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWtraveler213

50,AMAZING!,"We saw the LA Philharmonic and the amazing Gustavo Dudamel. Totally memorable and worth the price. The architecture is amazing . . . the sound is perfect . . . the seats are comfortable and decor is impeccable. What a gem!

40,Low key evening entertainment,"The architecture is lovely, the seating and acoustics in the hall is great-- not a bad seat in the house. It's a really relaxing musical experience after a long day. There is also a cafe, which is a bit pricey, but a good idea to fend off the hangries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelinem584
40,Fun and Free (for touring),"We didn't see a concert here, but my wife (who is an architecture nerd) and I did have a marvelous time doing a free tour. The hall is open to the public during the day and allows folks to stroll through the building (though not the concert hall itself), including the extensive outdoor space. You can do the self-guided meander (we did), or you sign up for (no cost) the audio tour. While the indoor space is of course grand, with clean lines, light wood and chrome facings, we really enjoyed the outside of the building. You can go to the top floor and wind your way down to the street level. There are gardens, fountains and great views. Good fun for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Balto-Rob

50,"Amazing building, defies description!","Visited this unusual/beautiful/stunning building to see a performance of the LA Philharmonic. The interior is very nice, but it's the outside that will leave you struggling to come up with adequate words to describe it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rolandws
50,A must for locals and visitors,"The architecture of the place is mind blowing both outside and inside. The place has plenty of parking underground. There is a gift shop and a restaurant as well as a few bars which allow for a one stop, all evening experience. Just arrive early enough as the restaurant seating is limited. However, the main attraction is the music hall and the wonderful music that takes place therein. There are virtually no bad seats. Even the seats behind the orchestra are offering an attractive addition to the experience as they allow for a very up-close look at the conductor as he/she does his/her magic. I went to see/hear the Passion of St. Matthew by J. S. Bach. Although, master chorale is not my cup of tea and the length of the work as well as the German in which the Passion is sung made it a bit tasking , the experience was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dasmarek

Street Parking varies from $1 for an hour to $4 an hour depending on how close once has parked to the concert hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonD28
40,Great venue but the food service is slow and disorganized,"Nice venue for concerts but don't expect to go in and quickly grab a bite to eat before the event starts. The line is long and the galley-style eatery is confusing because there are no signs above any of the selections and you can't see what selections are available until it's your turn to order. They could fix this by adding some signs above the salad and hot food stations. I suggested this but the employees brushed it off. It takes what could be a 5-star experience and makes it a 3, because after driving all the way in from Orange County (1.5 hour drive in traffic) we needed some dinner and it would have been nice to have someone in management actually care about the patrons and give us a nice, organized, quick way to eat before or after the concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margom613

50,"Excellent acoustics, vibrant interior design, convenient and affordable parking.","We visited the Concert Hall on two consecutive nights. Though seated once in front ad once behind the stage, both locations provided excellent sound. The hall itself, and even more, the hallways, are constructed with a feel-good modern design. The parking lot (vast!) is located directly under the hall. If you know which exit to take from the parking, you can exit right into the front foyer of the concert hall itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/your-servant

50,Martha Argerich Concert February 15 2015,We came from Ontario Canada to hear Martha Argerich play. Both the concert and the hall were a brilliant experience. I loved the seating and acoustics. The only disappointment is that no one presented Ms. Argerich with flowers but perhaps that happened at one of the two prior concerts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneP5

40,over hyped,"My husband and I attended a concert here, flying in from out of town to hear a rare appearance by pianist Martha Argerich in her only US appearance this season. The great Dudamel was not available to appear with this goddess/icon of classical music and the replacement was not worthy. The hall is not particularly aesthetically appealing, another modern atrocity without any redeeming artistic quality. The much hyped acoustics were a mix tof good and bad. Yes, the clarity is fantastic but there is no blending of the orchestral sound or much warmth. Everhy rustle or the program, every cough or whisper is amplified along with the music making for a dull roar in the badkground at all times. Argerich, however provided a magic that made all these negatives pale. Possibly the most perfect performance by any artist we have ever heard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teadivamuse
50,Amazing Place,"The building is beautiful. The sound is great. Pick the type of music you would like to hear. Food is good. There is a parking lot that has plenty of parking.

From that moment on this building was on my ""Bucket List"" and I don't even have a ""Bucket List"". Hands down it's the most inspiring building that I've ever seen. I spent two days ""shooting"" the building - mostly in B & W. It just doesn't get better. I've recommended this building to all of my friends as a ""Must See in LA""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geezegood
20,"Look at the outside, forget the inside",Great piece of architecture on the outside. Wonderful from an aerial view.Inside is like any other place. Seats are so close you have to evict an entire row to get through.Go to the Hollywood Bowl if you want to hear the LA Philharmonic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebelruth
50,Music Lovers: Don't Miss,One of the great concert halls in the world. The acoustics and sight lines are unmatched with anywhere I've seen. I can't even imagine how they could be better. Disney Concert Hall is one reason I will never move away from SoCal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssperl
50,Worth a journey,"LA's one truly world-class architectural monument. To see its like you have to go to Bilbao and who wants to do that? It's almost a cliche, if absolutely true, to note that the acoustics are fabulous, and the concert hall interior is as spectacular as the exterior. For the long-legged, though, the seating will feel cramped.The Hall also includes Patina, a top-rated restaurant, and a lovely roof garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdh44laca
50,Elegant and Stunning,"There are no bad seats at the concert hall and you can try $10.00 tickets, I.e.

Good store as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickieD235

50,Inredible concert at a beautiful hall,"Disney Hall's acoustics and beauty are unmatched, if you like modern design. The orchestra has truly become first rate, among the top in the US and the world. We heard Martha Argerrich do the Shumann piano concerto and Strauss's Death and Transfiguration, also wonderful. For tall people a little more leg room would have be nice if not in the very front orchestra but the place is built so that is academic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
50,A beautiful experience.,"The Diz is a gorgeous place to see music. We were fortunate that Gustavo Dudamel was conducting Pictures at an Exhibition, which was of course a tremendous piece of music. Dudamel is dynamic and light-hearted and the music was spectacular. I find the tickets to be pricy, but you get what you pay for. We had front balcony seats and a great view- even better than if we were in the orchestra seats. It's worth spending a little more on tickets if you plan to take in the whole experience. Wandering the building is a must, and there are many great vantage points from which to people watch. The lobby was decorated for the holidays when we went- it was lovely. The gift shop is full of great music, sophisticated LA-themed gifts, and a nice time killer while you're waiting for the parking garage line to thin out. Parking is conveniently located under the building, but be sure to make a note of where you parked- it is a vast structure. No trip to LA is complete without a visit to the Disney or the Bowl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATripp

50,The Sound!,"While this is a magnificent example of Frank Ghery's architecture and worth a visit just for that, you'll be missing an even greater treat if you attend a concert.

50,Stunning facade - what awaits you inside is beautiful,Loved the style of construction. So modern and futuristic. We walked in and picked the audio guide tour around the building. The interiors are completely in contrast to the exteriors. The architect was very thoughtful of each and every detail keeping the Walt Disney family in mind. There is a beautiful water fountain on the terrace garden shaped like a rose and made with Delft pottery as Mrs Disney loved roses and the blue Delft. Took my breath away. The family's tribute to city of LA! must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Priya_T
50,Magical Acoustic Space,"If you enjoy music and will be in the Los Angeles area, get a ticket to a performance -- any performance -- in this venue. The interior is beautiful, the acoustics almost as good as that within the Sidney Opera House and likely the best of any venue in the United States.In addition to being the indoor venue of the LA Phil and the LA Chamber Orchestra, the Frank Geary designed Walt Disney Concert Hall also hosts a wide range of popular contemporary musical artists.TIP: Symphonies for Youth concerts are geared to be entertaining for families.TIP: For those interested in architecture, tours are available.TIP: The LA Metro stops at the location.TIP: If you don't have time to dine nearby prior to the event, there's good quality food as well as wine and beer available on-site provided by Patina. It's prepared salads, sandwiches, fruit and cheese plates, etc. There's ample tables and chairs for dining. Note: No food may go into the auditorium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConduitConsulting

50,Memorable experience,"The acoustics are outstanding, the wood-lined interior warm and inviting, the exterior architecturally stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421dwightd
30,A visual feast...A so so music experience,"This is a very expensive evening if your so inclined to take the plunge. At least the onsite parking is a reasonable $7.00. The Geary designed structure is truly a wonder. However, maybe I'm the only one not singing the praises of the acoustics. while the sound may have a purity to it it seems to reach the seats without much of a punch. The sound lacks presence. It is like having a weak amplifier where you need to greatly turn up the volume to gain a good sound. The hall just doesn't channel the sound with any power. So if you come to LA and have the funds to burn spending over $200 per person for entertainment and dinner then go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul_nancy1
40,Gorgeous architecture,"We were on a grand tour of LA and this was one of the featured places we drive past, but did not stop at. We were here just long enough for the WOW factor and take a few pictures. The architecture is awesome, the grounds are immaculate, and everything appeared very well maintained.

50,A slice of heaven in central Los Angeles,"I've heard some awe-inspiring sounds from the L.A. Philharmonic bounce off the walls of this top-notch concert hall in downtown Los Angeles. Not only is it the winter home of the LA. Phil., K.D. Lang has graced us with her presence here. I've heard the beautiful bliss of Celtic music at Christmastime. Last week I was enthralled with the youth orchestra from Colburn Hall, conducted by none other than Sir Neville Marriner. Some of the best acoustics I've experienced. It's always a n unforgettable time when I venture to Disney Hall. For me the happiest place on earth isn't in Anaheim, it's at that other Disney home in the heart of the City of Angels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reallivewire
50,"Astounding Architecture, Shining Through...","Even if you don't have time to attend a concert at the Disney Concert Hall, it's absolutely worth taking an hour or so and taking the free self-guided tour of the venue - it's truly amazing. As beautiful as it looks in all the photos you've seen, and very cool to go behind the scenes. We'd have taken the more intimate for pay tour, but didn't arrive at the right time, and it really didn't matter. Grab a set of the headphones, follow the signs to the first listening post, and then take your time wandering up and down and around Frank Gehry's masterpiece of a concert hall. You'll learn about architecture and its challenges, you'll see behind the shiny exterior panels to the complex maze of piping that holds it all together, and eventually get to stroll outside. There you'll find a lovely garden, nice views of Los Angeles, and super spots for pictures of your own. We were very pleased with the quality of the narrated tour, and delighted overall.

We also visited the Dorothy Chandler and Mark Taper theatres.I also went back and walked the outside aerial walkway on my own, for some great views.A couple of nights later I went to an LA Philharmonic concert, and thought the hall superb - the acoustics are perfect. Apparently the bottom of each seat is covered with some material so that if no-one is sitting in it, it acts as if they are, so the acoustics can be perfectly calibrated!Such an asset to the cultural life of LA and a stunning building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Beautiful,"I attended a concert with Znaider playing the Sibelius concerto - I found the sound of the hall to be rich, full, and beautiful. I was in the front orchestra but it didn't look like there was a bad seat in the house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flipper775
50,Disney Hall Hall Experience is a Must,"The acoustics in the Disney Hall are unmatched. Of particular interest is the magnificentorgan…it looks like a huge creature from another galaxy but is really quite an artistic achievement both artistically and visually. So highly recommend the concert that features the organ.While every seat in the house is a wonderful listening experience, I do not recommend theseats behind the stage unless on a budget. The artists will turn and acknowledge the audience behind but it is BEHIND the performers. I have attended MANY concerts here since it opened, the last two were in December…the Holiday Organ Spectacular and Chanticleer…both not to be missed even though they were back to back evening performances. Please do not take young children. I attended a concert last June where a baby was crying, was removed but could still be heard in the concert venue even though the baby was crying in the hallway. There really needs to be rules about age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristieC665
50,Fabulous Building. Great Acoustics and Not A Bad Seat In The House,"A spectacular place to experience a performance, home to the LA Philharmonic, Walt Disney Concert Hall is modern and yet warm and incredibly comfortable.

50,Amazing Venuew and Designed for exceptional musical acoustics,"The venue is well organized and even though the Grand Park across the street was hosting a New Year Eve party for 30,000, it was easy to get into the parking at 7 pm. There is 7 floors of under ground parking in the area and it never gets full. Getting out may take awhile so plan on snacks and drinks for after ward. Tickets are easy to get on Ticketmaster. The sound is great in all areas, but I avoid seating behind the stage. I prefer not staring at perfomer's backs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMcClureDVM
50,"Such a Gorgeous venue, such a Fun Concert. Cheers to 2015","The Walt Disney Concert Hall itself probably does not need much introducing/explaining :) But perhaps you have not heard of Pink Martini or even the Von Trapp kids... Either way, they put on quite a show. They are ALL very talented, and fun/funny, and Oh So fun to listen to. Great New Year's eve concert. Very entertaining. If I HAD to find something negative to say - I'd say it was too short. I wanted more - pretty sure so did the rest of the audience :)Oh, a great UP side, parking at the WDCH is only $5!! Almost unheard of in LA. True story :)Happy New Year everyone. Happy 2015",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheQueenR
50,New Years Eve happy place with Pink Martini,"Early program kept us away from the throng at Grand Park and we dressed up classic, - traveled in a Limo from great lodging in Riverside - went for it ringing in 2015!I highly recommend this kind of celebration - we grabbed a quick hot roast beef sandwhiches at Philippe's - a historic hole in the wall - quite near concert - a PERFECT venue on timing and home by 10PM after celebrating in New York time.Disney Concert Hall is fabulous and Pink Martini rocks with such palpable talent - this night featuring the authentic yodeling great grandchildren of the real people in the Sound of Music story as well as a group of Japanese businessmen doing the hand jive and of course the fabulous voice of Pink Martini's lead singer. Humor and musical talent of the show were incredibly delightful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheeryCarol

50,Walt Disney music hall in Los Angeles California,Home of the Los Angeles Philarmonic a great place to visit a must if you are in downtown Los Angeles ...most of the time at 12 noon they have excellent guided tours of the premises or if you are in a hurry they do have audio tours.A big treat will be if you plan ahead and see one of their performances,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/664albah
40,A Fascinating Place!,If you are more familiar with the tradional proscenium arch style of concert hall will need to re-think their thinking. The beautiful wooden interior provides excellent acoustics! I've attended both small ensemble performances as well as the LA Master Choral Messiah Sing-a-Long. The location supports them both equally well. Well worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deniseo632
50,Wonderful World of Disney and Music,"This is a 400 million dollar facility that has the most amazing pipe organ in the world. It has wood throughout that gives the concert hall the best acoustics available. The LA Phil is a world class orchestra whose performers play on instruments valued at 500K or more and the antiquity of these instruments produce a sound that transports you to a heavenly realm. If you have a chance to hear a concert in this hall, you have to go. This attraction should be on every music lover's bucket list. We took our adult children who play the cello, violin and mandolin and they were mesmerized.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieRKay

50,A Superb Listening and Visual Experience,"Our experiences as a Los Angeles Philharmonic season ticket holder are unsurpassable. We love the decor, the comfort of the seats and the various seating locations which provide different listening experiences. But for the casual visitor, this should not be missed. The architecture is so fabulous! On the outside depending on the time of day the titanium plating on the wavy, circular architectural abstractions creates a visual masterpiece. Do not leave your camera behind! On the inside there are outside patios connecting on every level. Plants and sculptures fill the spaces. Many seating areas and interesting views. The main concert hall is a beauty to behold. Many woods and inside vistas. The gigantic organ is spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne7Losangeles
50,"Forget Hollywood Boulevard, this is better!","I visited LA for a day on my trip to California this summer, we did the obvious Hollywood Boulevard trip, but it was this architectural piece that stole my heart! And that's just from the outside! Unfortunately I didn't see anything inside, which I'm sure would've been spectacular in its own right, but I was pretty happy just wandering around the ups and downs of this building's exterior. Perfect for any architecture fan, and photographers alike. It's got some really tranquil nooks and crannies for being in the centre of the thriving city like LA. I loved it. Well worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gateauxblaster
50,Must see! Must hear!,"For visitors to LA, the Walt Disney Concert Hall is a must see for its architecture, but do to do it justice you must attend a concert: LA Philharmonic, LA Master Chorale, an organ concert, or a concert in the recital series. The acoustics are spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfG465YM
50,Spectacular Concert Hall,"Very exciting architecture even more interesting than Bilbao, Spain. The acoustics are terrific but the leg room is tight! The inside is so interesting that every time you come you notice a different angle in the design of the building. Even the outside patio area is interesting with unusual trees, plants and a most unusual mosaic like fountain. This concert hall is a treasure for Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217anitaw

40,Free Tours!,If you are in the downtown area - take the Free tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall!I took the free audio tour w/ my mother in law and we both enjoyed it. The front desk gives you your own set of headphone/audio control & the audio guide tells you all about the concert hall. Its all very interesting and it's a beautiful place both inside and outside. A Must See for any architect / design buff! plus did I mention the audio tour is Free!? - Parking in Downtown - Well that's hardly every free so if you didn't walk from close by or take the Metro to the Disney Concert Hall bring some $cash for Parking. Personally I found a meter spot by the Grand Central Market and took Bunker Hill Angels Flight up to the Concert Hall. Downtown LA does really have some great history/shopping and food! so Make a day out of it! & Have fun walking around the area :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iriegrl
50,If you love architecture,"If you love architecture and you want to see a masterpiece up close, go to Disney Hall. Walt Disney's wife Lillian donated $50 million in honor of her husband but it eventually cost $130 million to build. You'd have to buy a plant ticket to Bilbao, Spain to see its precursor - the Guggenheim Museum. You can see Gehry's elegant design and distinctive titanium curves right here in LA. Both inside and outside you are guaranteed spectacular photos. And of course the next time you see IronMan, you'll recognize the party location. Try booking concert tickets (of any kind) to enjoy the amazing acoustics. At the first rehearsals before its opening, the story goes that Esa-Pekka Salonen couldn't believe his ears. THe discovered that there were wrong notes in the printed parts of the Ravel that sit on the players' stands. The orchestra has owned these scores for decades, but in the Chandler hall no conductor had ever heard the inner details well enough to notice the errors! Book dinner inside at Patina. Or nearby at SugarFish, WaterGrill or Drago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waltona1
50,Downtown's Brilliant Gem,"Whether you live in Los Angeles or you're visiting Los Angeles from near or far, seeing this iconic location and, better yet, watching/listening to a concert is a must. Yes, we've seen a couple of concerts that did not delight us, but we LOVED being there. And when we were there for a favorite concert, it was so worth the effort. So, if there's something that you'd like to see, by all means get tickets and go. And yes, food is available in the cafe (really a decent cafeteria) or in the fabulous Patina Restaurant. Also Bottega Louis is close by, along with a variety of great restaurants. Bottom line: Go and enjoy! Nice gift shop, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heartfeltreview

50,Spectacular,from an architectural stand point just walking around this concert all both outside and in provides for some very interesting and stunning picture taking. We didn't have the time this visit to experience the acoustics with a concert but just walking around the exterior and viewing the interior was worth the stop downtown,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeanM7303
40,A Landmark with Outstanding Programming,"We loved our season tickets to the LA Phil. The performances were unforgettable, and the space feels intimate enough that there's not one bad seat in the house. Parking, dining, and getting in and out are all easy and efficient; we never felt stressed or frazzled, even if we were coming straight from work on a Friday night.Our best recommendations: If you're seeing an LA Phil performance, try getting seats behind the orchestra at least once. It was the coolest! We were close enough to almost read the sheet music, and we got a completely different perspective on the performance as we watched the percussion and brass sections move in and out and change instruments. We also recommend the annual Halloween program: WDCH shows an old silent horror film with a live organ performance to accompany it. Guests often wear costumes, and there's always a little talk first about the movie and the newly-composed score. A really cool way to spend Halloween.My only complaint about the venue is that there is verrrrry little legroom in the balconies, so even shorter folks like me feel cramped. I have no idea where tall people fit their legs. If you need to get up, you will basically have to shimmy across strangers' laps to reach the aisle, so prepare to make some close new friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsLadybeard

Really beautiful music. I wish it was closer to Santa Monica as it is difficult to get there and back on the freeway but the grandeur of the building inside is fabulous, the colors and the billowing of the ceiling is so unique like fabric. Really grand!!!!!! Great audience appreciation and men wearing jackets, oh my!!!! In fact alot of men, oh my!!!! Very very lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73helenew

50,Always a lovely time,"We go every now and again to see the LA Philharmonic, which is fantastic. I love that there is no bad seat in the house. The acoustics are amazing, and there is a real personal touch to the in-the-round seating. It's a smaller and more intimate venue. It is also less hectic in the lobby, somehow, during intermission, than many other sites. We get a wide variety in styles of music and many big names come through here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisd716

40,Spectacular but impersonal,"The Disney is, upon first visit, spectacular to look at, with superb acoustics.

The concert hall has a unique look, with the organ pipes like giant french fries. The acoustics are great, with the lows coming up through the floor and right into your seat and up your butt! The LA Phil is one of the best orchestras in the world, and has a dynamic young conductor (Dudamel - ""the Dude""). We have subscription and go regularly to the concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjmins
30,First class acoustics but coach class seating,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is located in downtown Los Angeles. The beauty of the fancy exterior is in the eye of the beholder, but the hall itself is definitely very beautiful inside and the acoustics are incredibly good. The personnel are very well trained to help the concert goers or the visitors. The only unpleasant thing about it are the seats which are as narrow as the latest seats on airplanes in the coach section. If you happen to be seated next to a big person, and once I was, tough luck, you'll have to scoot over a bit to the opposite side. There simply isn't room enough. It was funny, the big guy next to me seemed to be honestly wondering why his family had bought seats on the row behind us. Was it possible they'd gone with him before?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erwinw2013

50,Disney Hall,"Disney Hall's unique design is surpassed only by it's excellent acoustics, possibly the best in the world. The eclectic music presented is performed by one of the best orchestras and led by the innovative and exciting conductor Maestro Dudamel. There are reasonable parking options and on site dining and at intermission you can spend some pleasant moments in the garden. All in all a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larryk491

I highly recommend taking pictures on the grand staircase in front of the building... you will feel like a superstar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6017SYelizabeths
50,A Los Angeles Icon,"If you are in LA for any reason, get tickets to go. Yes, be prepared to pay an arm and a leg. Go anyway. Music, particularly classics, never sounded this good before. From any seat you can hear every instrument. (And every cough and sneeze so please, no talking during a performance,) And the place is ""old school"" If you are late, you will not be seated until a break in the performance. Fashionably late is a bad idea.From the sky, the Hall looks like a rose, Why? The rose was Walt Disney's favorite flower. The multiple layers of design care and sophistication are everywhere in the Hall. Even with the improvements to the Hollywood Bowl's acoustics, the LA Phil will sound way better here.Some specifics: If you want to try to save a little $ and still experience the Hall, get tickets to a Chamber Orchestra night. Mid-week and small group, good tickets are usually available and are far less expensive than a full orchestra performance. Do try to get your tickets early, events to sell out, even at these nosebleed prices. If there is a pre-program to discuss that nights music, it is worth attending. You will learn new things about the composers and the music you will listen to. Last year I learned the the violin solo in ""Scherazade"" is meant to be her voice in telling the tales of a 1001 Arabian Nights. The one kind of performance I would stay away from is Organ concerts, particularly if the program features modern works. The Hall does have a marvelous built in pipe organ, but when modern pieces are played too fast, the sound goes muddy. Old pieces do not suffer from this issue. My first concert of the season will be Saint-Saens ""Organ Symphony.""See and listen to LA at its finest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishyak
40,Beautiful building with good concerts,"The hall is magnificent to attend for a concert. You can also separately get a tour, including the garden. If you have less time available, the lobby interior is open to the public during regular business hours. Combined with a walk around the exterior, you can get a good sense of the creativity and imagination of the design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEIreland
50,Stellar sound and architecture,Don't miss the outdoor back garden - you can visit and have an al fresco meal anytime w/o tickets to see the LA Phil. But don't miss going for a concert. a nice option is ditting behind the orchestra with a view of the conductor. Usually those tickets are cheaper too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100lat

50,Highlight of my LA visit,"I was blown away by this building, discovered using the self-guided tour. It is an amazing building, brilliantly designed, and the tour helps you understand all the thought that has gone into each part of the final building. I spent hours there, just soaking it in. It looks magnificent from outside, and magical inside. A huge disappointment that there is no opportunity to see the main auditorium. But the building is more than a shell around one venue, there are nooks and crannies and thoughtfulness throughout. And the generosity of the Disney family and other donors has ensured that everything is the highest quality.Biggest surprise was the garden, outdoor amphitheater, and attention to making it an integral part of the city.I am very familiar with the Sydney Opera House, and this building gave me the same sense of wonder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GillianInSydney
50,Wonderful building with a wonderful self-guided audio tour,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a beautiful piece of architecture. I took the self-guided audio tour which you can take at your own speed. The tour is clearly indicated throughout the building, with excellent commentaries by many people involved in the building offering you much insight in the creation process of the building. The tour takes you through most parts of the building except the concert hall due to the many rehearsals that take place there. I never felt rushed and in fact it was clear to see that the many people surveilling the building really love the place and happy to share their enthousiasm with visitors. I took photos all the way along the tour, and no one objected. The fountain in the roof garden is a favourite spot for selfies. Highly recommendable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Henri8888
40,Very good self guided audio tour,"We visited the Walt Disney Concert Hall whilst we were exploring the sights of Downtown LA. We had only expected to see the exterior of the building so were pleasantly surprised to find that you can do a self guided audio tour, and that the tour is actually free!The tour provides lots of information about the concert hall, from its conception, design and planning, to the construction and materials used. The narration is by John Lithgow and also features dialogue from various people involved in the project, including Frank Gehry and Diane Disney Miller. The tour lasts about an hour.Unfortunately, you do not get access to the auditorium, but the tour was very informative and interesting non the less. This is a truly spectacular building, and it was nice to be able to see the interior, and hear about its design, and not just witness it from the street.Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuperTim69
50,the music of architecture,"If you have at least two hours at hand to spare, this is the place to go. It is not just a brilliant modern architecture or the home of the LA philharmonic orchestra but every part of the building tells you the unison of art and architecture.The place offers two types of tours-- self-guided audio tour and group tour led by a guide. Do not wait for the group tour and go for the audio tour. It has an excellent narration and you can see and feel the place at your own will and pace. In fact, there are areas where you can spend more time to understand the acoustics and probably sing a song to see the magic.all tours are free.If you are lucky, you can also catch a live performance at their outdoor auditorium on the third floor. We met a group of Bolivian folk singers.One can also get nice view of other city buildings from the balcony of this hall.Go there in the morning as the tours generally gets over by afternoon. They also have special arrangement for big groups.If Hollywood is the identity of LA the Walt Disney hall is the city's jewel in the crown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaubhadraC

30,Beautiful building,"Would have loved to been able to seen more, but as there was a performance, unable to check out anything more than the lobby. I think we must have caught the staff on an off day as they weren't very receptive to helping tourists learn more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glowach_Family
50,The Architecture is amazing,The beautiful theatre has the signature of Frank Gehry's with those sail designs and similar to the new Louis Vuiton center in France. Lovelly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moniqueashbrook
50,Fascinating Architecture,"LA Phil, Dudamel, LA Master Choral in the most beautiful concert venue on the planet. It's a wonderful place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miandho
40,Impressive,"Impressive, vast curvy structure. A quarter of a billion dollars to build, 50 million of which was stumped up by Walt Disney's widow. Apparently when it was built it was *so* shiny that it was blinding drivers on the freeway, so they had to take the polish off. If you go down the side street and look at the side of the hall, you can still see the original finish though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blowback

50,The acoustics and architecture simply add to the music,"Los Angeles is a better place because of Disney Hall. My husband and I subscribed to the LA Phil before the Hall was built and have attended many concerts at Disney. You can hear a single note, and they are almost always good notes. A wide variety of music by talented artists is played there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCV999
50,"Frank Gehry building, John Adams music, Wow","During our visit to LA, we attended one of the Minimalist Jukebox concerts. What a wonderful experience. The pre-concert talk included Adams, conductor and one of the composers (Naïve and Sentimental Music) and Gordon composer of Sunshine of Your Love (U.S. premiere). Great introduction into music to follow. Be sure to attend the pre-concert talks.The most interesting piece was At the Royal Majestic (world premiere) by Riley. An interpretation of a theater organ commissioned for the The Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Walt Disney Hall pipe organ, and what a great pipe organ both in appearance (as wild as the building) and sound.The exterior of building is very similar to the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, while the interior is a wonderful almost maze of paths winding to the auditorium. Pay attention to directions or you may end up five feet from your seat with no way to get to it.Only downside was getting there, long and torturous drive on I-10 from Santa Monica. I need to learn LA's mass transit alternatives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasL483
50,Beautiful and elegant,"As I walked down grand ave towards this behemoth of a structure, my heart started to pound at my excitement. From outside, every sleek, every curve, every corner was just sheer beauty. I saw a bit of Mickey Mouse in the architecture of the building.Walking in was even more impressive. Te cleanliness, beauty and sophistication inside was unrivaled by any other music hall. I definitely will be returning to see the LA Philharmonic perform.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sirgizzle

He was a part of the Skidrow photography club. A movie about his life was filmed using this Concert Hall as its backdrop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaKeittKalule

50,Love this place,"I try to attend at least two or three concerts here each season. Its an amazing venue and I've never been disappointed. Even if the artist is not my favorite, the venue itself enhances the experience. There is no bad seat, the acoustics are phenomenal and they have something for everyone's musical tates",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels

30,Concert Hall.,I've been to lots of Concert halls in my life and this one was similar. The acoustics were great but I think what all the fuss is about is the architecture. Which is amazing but I guess not for me. i actually shouldn't even write an average review but I feel like if I was going to L. A. for the first time I could find lots of other great cultural places to visit that I would prefer. I believe JANA is a museum close by that is more interesting. But thats just me. Little Tokyo has lots to see as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VanghusF
50,Shut out,Although I checked opening hours on line whe we arrived it was closed for a Saturday rehearsel. The receptionist said I should have phoned to check. Quite rude and the fellow in the shop was even loathe to sell me a post card in lieu of the expected tour of the building let alone attend to the purchase of another visitor. Bah.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908stellaw

Any 40 or 50 y/old musician woulda been hard pressed to keep up with this cat. He's 80 !!OK, the venue has NO distortion, Crystal clear sound and we sat BEHIND the quintet. Took the train from Union Station, ate at Olvera St. and just had a remarkable night. I imagine classical would be wonderful, as well. Nothing was amiss. Beautiful venue, clean and the crowd was appreciative, respectful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daddiot3

Tripods are not allowed however, unless you're off their property.I have seen one concert there and it's a very nice theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddHata
50,Bucket list for music lovers,"Parking is great underneath the hall, downtown traffic isn't too bad on a Saturday night but coming from almost anywhere - leave more time. The architecture inside and out definitely impacts your concert experience. It doesn't have to be the LA Philharmonic but if it is, you'll be very well rewarded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipM312
50,Impressive!!,"This was one of our stops during our LA tour, and WOW, what an impressive concert hall! I'm not an architect by any means but was in awe at the design of this place. Our tour guide took some interesting photos of us along the backside of the building with some illusion effects. We also went inside the concert hall, and I can only imagine how beautiful the music is flowing out of there! I'd love to return someday and attend a concert.

40,Live entertainment,I enjoyed the seating in the building. I found that the closer you sit to the stage the more difficult it is for you eyes to take it all in.

50,A Magnificent Structure!,"I was in a play that had our rehearsals at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, that I had header about but had never visited.

50,Walt Disney Concert Hall,"I have been fortunate enough to see some really amazing concerts at this venue. It's easy to grab a light dinner, the book and souvenir shop is fun to browse in as is people watching around the bar. The acoustics and aesthetics of the Concert Hall are some of the best in the world. To give you an example of musical offerings that I have attended are: Gustavo Dudamel conducting the L.A. Philharmonic, An Acoustic Evening with Ben Harper, Ravi Shankar's Golden Jubilee concert and Mark Adamo's The Gospel of Mary Magdalene (2014). Treat yourself to a wonderful evening or matinee at Disney's Concert Hall, you will have a memorable time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diva_Anonymous

40,Great Architecture,"Having arrived between the docent-guided tours, it was nice to avoid the 45 minute wait before the next one began and take a self-guided tour. A very impressive tour detailing the founding of the hall, some of the philanthropists who donated to it's creation and endurance, and its history. This was a very informative stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/handymanron
50,Magnificent,"If you are in to architecture make sure the Walt Disney Concert Hall is on your list. I was surprised at how much time I spent there, not at a performance, just wondering around the building itself. There is a great self-guided audio tour about the design and construction of the concert hall. Well worth taking. It was a nice place to slow down and break pace of an otherwise hectic holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550ryanl
40,I had the worst seats and enjoyed the place.,There is not much to say here. If you are looking at this you are probably going to go to something down there. A beautiful building and we all had a nice time in the worst seats in the house.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
50,Not to be missed!,If you're in LA make sure you spend a couple of hours here. A stunning building with a superb audio tour to accompany you around the inside and outside of the Hall.

50,"Stunning to admire from the outside, an auditory gift on the inside.","This is a fantastic place to see a show. The acoustics dazzle and the night is classy from head to toe.

50,Behind the scenes tour of a work of genius,"If you like architecture, or even if you don't, go on the free tour of the concert hall. I went two years ago with a guide, and last week again using the audio recording narrated by John Lithgow. Both were excellent, in fact, using the hand held device means you can linger where you want. You can hear architect Frank Gehry speak, along with others involved in this stunning achievement.Next time we are in LA, maybe we will actually get to a concert there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zvic2018
30,"Architecturally Stunning On the Outside, Disappointing on the Inside","I could stand and look at the outside of the Disney Concert Hall all day long, but I would never go here for a concert again. The way it is built, with the seats going up at very steep incline is horribly uncomfortable. I felt like I was in a fishbowl. I have seen several concerts here from classical to David Byrne and Ive not enjoyed a single one. Aside from that, the interior of the hall is far from elegant. When I go to a concert hall to see a performance, I expect the same glitz on the indise as I do on the outside. I have to say, the interior looks cheap. Sorry Disney…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobominkin
50,Great Place to See a Concert,"We have enjoyed going to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. When we go we usually stay at the Omni Hotel. It is walking distance to the concert hall. The exterior of the concert hall is very unique; its a place that many people love to photograph. When going in and seeing a concert, we find that the views from the seats are quite good. Sound system is excellent. It is an enjoyable way to see a show. We have been a few times. Our favorite time there was seeing Big Bad Voo Doo Daddy there on New Years eve several years back. It was an awesome way to bring in the New Year.When in the LA area, we generally check the venue's web site to see what events are going on and see if we are interested in attending. The hall is the resident home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and we have enjoyed seeing them at the concert hall on our recent visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
40,Pretty Cool,"Not much of a theatre or orchestra kind of person but the architecture is simply amazing!!We got lucky as there were free self guided tours that day.If you get the chance take it.

50,Magical building,"You don't need to travel to Bilbao, Spain to see Frank Gehry masterpiece. The Walt Disney Concert Hall designed by the same famed architect showcases and conveys the same magic spirit of steel, light and elegant curves. Walk across the street corner and take in this building in whole. Take the tour (either guided or self-guided) and walk around all parts of the interior, then go outside and venture through the narrow pathways between those steel walls and the garden. Peer down onto the street from the top of the brass wall. You will be in awe just as I am with this building of the wood interior and metal exterior, organic and inorganic melt together in harmony. They rely on volunteers to man the tour so it is only available on selected days. Check their web site for the tour days. I personally prefer the self-guided tour which allows you to go at your own pace and take as many pictures as you please without trying to catch up with the group. It is narrated by John Lithgow and packed with information and stories about the history and design of this building, with interviews including Gehry. You can park at the concert hall parking lot ($11). With the receipt that you have taken the tour (which is free) you will get a refund of $9, a pretty good deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MojaveMaxNewYork

We got to hear a talented pal sing in his Men's Chorale one night and found the entire experience as magical as any Disney inspiration. It was relatively easy on/off the highway; Parking is a breeze; There were ample amenities (including handicap accessibility) for all that makes a fun location, and then some, including souvenir shopping; plus the cappuccino during intermission in the lil' café was Belisimo! Needless to say our baritone star stole the show, but not before we were brought speechless from the lovely architectural elements both on the exterior, and with the well-polished wooden accents inside the interior of the concert hall and stage. Bravo to all involved in conceiving such a breathtaking venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffMateas
50,Amazing architecture,"I've had my second visit to Walt Disney Concert Hall, and it was even better than my first. I wasn't as surprised and amazed as I was the first time, but my experience was even better. On my first visit, I took a tour with a human guide. She did an excellent job, but we had to go at a certain pace because it was a group. This time, I did a tour with the recorded guide, and it was better for two reasons. One reason is that I heard the voices of the architect, the acoustical engineer and such describing building the structure as well as the voice of Disney's daughter describing how her mother was involved in the commission and design of the building. The second reason is that I was able to go at my own pace. I could stop as long as I wanted at any given spot to gaze my fill.I recommend visiting the hall in any way that you like, but I recommend the recorded guide as the best way to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sablatt
50,A visual as well as aural experience,"It wears its 10 years of age very well. Frank Gehry gives the visitor a most intriguing experience with his use of form and volume. What an inspiring use of light and shape, a living work of art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidMinneapolis
50,More Magical than the most Magical Place on Earth,"My husband surprised me with Kraftwerk tickets for a show at Disney Hall. Of course the outside of the theater is a beautiful modern twisted building but the star is the inside of the building. it's one of the best places ever to see a concert. The sound was amazing, and looking around it seemed there wasn't a bad seat in the place. Once inside, you are transported through time and the sense of doing something artistic, and it's an experience not to be missed, whatever you go to see there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codytravelsalot
30,Free Public Tour was trivia filled.,If you like your philharmonic and architecture go for the public tour which takes you through the interior and exterior of the place. I wouldn't have noticed half the stuff were I to wander around on my own. Favourite part was visiting the hall itself which is hardly done unless the hall is not being used - go on a Sunday morning to increase your chances of this. Hope to visit on Halloween when they screen the horror movie and light up the hidden organ pipes!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLPA
50,Mindblowing!,"We took a very good tour of the Disney Music Hall. The architecture is phenomenal and the attention to details (carpeting, wall hanging, etc.) is apparent.

Not only are they beautiful in any season, they also afford lovely views of downtown LA and have tables where you can enjoy a picnic lunch. But if you're lucky enough to attend a concert there, that's when you can appreciate the world-class acoustics and the visual appeal of the hall. We like to round out our concert experiences by arriving 1 1/2 hours early to eat at the cafeteria and listen to a pre-concert lecture. After the concert, it's always fun to visit the amazingly well-stocked gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HermineG_13

The Disney is beautiful inside and out and a truly unique concert setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sbstee
50,Worth the visit even if you don't go in,"I went to visit the outside of the Walt Disney Concert Hall just to take in the architecture and try to find a hidden garden I had heard of. You can walk all around the exterior and take staircases into hidden nooks and crannies with great views of downtown LA. A small garden that's elevated above street level features lovely blooming trees and a huge mosaic tile fountain in the shape of a flower. Great place to wander around, take some pictures, maybe have a coffee, and I hear the inside is even better! An hour is fine to just the outside (and thats free), not sure about time and price if you want attend a concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMW
50,Concert,This was an amazing Concert hall- absolutely beautiful on the inside. Saw the GMC of LA- wonderful.

UPHILL from downtown, so allow breathing time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EJHSydney

50,Very memorable visit,"Even with a short amount of time available it is a very worth while visit to call into the Disney Concert hall.

50,Beautiful place,"What a majestic piece of architecture. Looking at it outside, it just feels like it is a piece of music in mid flow, with a very unique architectural design.Inside, it was divided into really interesting sections and was modern and austere but in a good way. It reminded me of the inside of the Sydney Opera House on a smaller and more modern scale (the interior space).All in all, a wonderful place to visit or tour if you are in the area. The area is a little bit shady in itself so I would park as close to the music hall as possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k

50,Magnificent spectacle of American philanthropy,We stumbled on a free tour of this magnificent building by chance. The enthusiasm of the guide was infectious. She extended the tour and walked us through the jaw-droppingly dramatic building (the architect is a true genius) for 2 hours. This is a masterpiece.

50,A must in L.A.,"This incredible building in downtown L.A. combines great architecture with a very interesting agenda of events. Don't miss the L.A. Philarmonica with Gustavo Dudamel, a great and unique director",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTorre
50,Admirable Architecture,"A masterpiece from a great architect, Frank Gehry. It is a structure of 6664 stainless steel panels. Once inside, you can either join a guided tour or self-directed audio-tour. At the end of the tour, you can linger over drinks and food at the cafe.I was particularly fascinated by the rooftop Blue Ribbon Garden. The garden is an acre in size and consists of lush landscaping that blooms throughout the year. Visitors just cannnot miss the fountain, A Rose for Lily. Frank Gehry designed the fountain athat pays tribute to the late Lilian Disney and her love for Royal Delft porcelain tiles and roses. The fountain is a large rose that's covered in thousands of broken pieces of Delft porcelain and tiles. Seeing is believing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GanL
40,Wonderful place to hear a concert,"I love going to this concert hall because even though it can hold more than 2,000 people, it doesn't feel that big. In fact, it feels kind of ""cozy"" for holding that many. The LA Philharmonic is one of the very best orchestras, so if you have the opportunity, definitely take in a concert here in their home. Many good restaurants are nearby and Walt Disney Concert Hall has a shuttle which picks you up at a number of them and takes you back so you don't need to move your car (the shuttle is free). There're also restaurants in the Music Center run by the Patina Group--Patina, fine dining (expensive, but good!), Kendall's Brasserie, French (across the street), as well as a small cafeteria for a quick sandwich or salad in Disney Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCfoodie92648
40,Downtown L.A. 60yrs. Of experience!,"Many people think of downtown L.A., as a series of warehouses, because of the railroads. However, please keep in mind Little Tokyo, Olivera Street, are the center of Old L.A. . USC Medical Center is close by, many tourists may want to see it all! Please keep in mind, the ""Red Carpet"" and the STARS from Hollywood, gather at the the block near 'Disney Center', Theatre, Opera Hall, etc. I suggest that you stay, at the nearby Hilton Hotel, and walk to all of the attractions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeLa2pups
50,There is not a bad seat in the house!,It's an amazing piece of architecture and something that is a must if your visiting Los Angeles. There are wide varieties of concerts to choose from and there isn't a bad seat in the house. No matter where you sit the sound is perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deniseka
50,Magnificent Acoustics,The appearance of this building is amazing. It truly deserves its own large landscaped park surrounding it. Unfortunately it is located in a downtown area with no hope for a park on the exterior.We did find a garden on the third level of the building which was lovely and so peaceful.The Auditorium is spectacular. The pipe organ was just beautiful to see and hear. We enjoyed the performances of the World Project International Music Festival. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy music that this concert hall should not be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mossy48
50,Disney Concert Hall,"I am a professional musician. To experience a concert in Disney Hall is pure magic. The ultra modern structure may look futuristic outside, but inside you will discover a warm and beautiful environment with acoustics that are ""heavenly."" An Incredibly wonderful structure surrounds the concertgoer: giant dark wooden curves and arches reaching upward while you are seated comfortably in plush chairs, the music surrounding you as if you are somehow ""within the very music"" Like the great concert halls this is a place where the music ""is yours"" wherever you are seated - this includes being on either side of the orchestra or behind it. Having grown up in Philadelphia and enthralled by The Academy of Music ( designed by the La Scala architect ) I was memorized by the acoustics of The Disney. There is a wonderful gift shop with excellent books,CDs, music items,etc. There is also a restaurant/ bar within If you want to hear music the way it was meant to be heeled this facility will definitely engage and enthrall you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeromem117
40,absolute exquisite,the outside will captivate you for 20 minutes before you even set foot inside. the acoustics are amazing. It is truly hard to explain why you need to see it. It is unlike any other concert hall you have ever seen. The entire strip of art venues are worth the visit. Walk and look. you won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hellaneh
40,Lives up to its acoustic reputation,"Experiencing a concert here was on my 'bucket list', as most events are either sold out or beyond my budget. But I was able to get fantastic tickets to an LA Chamber Orchestra recital that was just wonderful; and I'm not partial to chamber music. I found the interior woodwork as fascinating as the exterior undulations, as well. If I ever have the chance to attend another concert here, I would definitely seek out the same seats in Orchestra L (I think this is Door 3, Garden Level).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfvalleymom
50,Gehry Architecture!,Such a wonderful piece of architecture. I was able to walk around the entire structure. Loved the gift shop! Didn't get to tour the entire space because they were having an event. Worth the trip it's gorgeous!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitzstudio

50,Fabulous Venue for Classical Music,This is a spectacular concert hall with amazing sound quality and an enormous organ behind the orchestra. There are seats on all four sides and the seats on the side allow the audience to feel as though they are almost in the middle of the orchestra. Try one of the casual Friday performances when the orchestra abandons their tuxedos and comes in informal dress.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayK280
50,Amazing free tour,On select times and days the concert hall is open and the tour is guided by an interesting person who has in depth knowledge about the hall and the roadblocks it had to overcome to be built 10 years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nanip123
50,Such a unique and interesting building,"We had such a fun and interesting time here. We went early for one of the free guided tours. There were about 15 people on the tour. Unfortunately for us there were rather annoying people on the tour and a number of kids who had been dragged along and were clearly not have their interest held by a building.The tour guide was interesting and did her best to control the group. It was not her fault, just bad luck. The building is fascinating and the tour does give you a really good look around with some interesting facts thrown in for good measure. We would absolutely recommend the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhaleuk

Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lozh_13
50,A Great Place to Hear Music and See It Made,"Disney Hall is truly a beautiful building to tour. However, your trip will not be complete without a concert. If you can obtain tickets to a concert here, any concert here, you will be rewarded with how well a building can function acoustically and visually. We have sat in every section of the auditorium for many different kinds of music and I can safely say there are no bad seats in the house. We particularly like sitting in the seats behind the orchestra, giving us a chance to read the music while it is being performed. The acoustics are so good that amplification is not needed. The L.A. Phil is one of the finest in the world and our conductor, Gustavo Dudamel is amazing. One thing I should mention as well, you can only see the auditorium by coming for a performance. The guided tours do not take you inside. If you love music, you will thank yourself for being smart enough to buy tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,Beautiful gardens and architecture,"The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a must-see.

The outside is chrome looking like billowy waves and then the inside totally the opposite with beautiful warm wood throughout. The balconies are curved and beautifully crafted to look almost like the sides currved sides of a boat. The accoustics are amazing. Then, if you have the extreme pleasure of hearing a concert conducted by Gustavo Dudamel ... heaven!!! Every time we come to Southern California we try to attend a concert here. Well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjn7
50,A Can't-Miss Part of Your Los Angeles Visit,"People come from all over to gaze at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, but why stop at a tour when you can really enjoy it the way it's meant to be seen: by attending a concert. Few shows sell out, and if you visit on a Tuesday or Thursday the tickets are very affordable. There are also wonderful concerts for children on Saturday mornings at only $20 a seat for the entire house. There are also often free events in the various outdoor spaces, and free lectures inside as well (the BP lecture hall is famous to Glee viewers as the ""Round Room"" performance space at the fictional NYADA)The auditorium is magnificent, but the beauty is outshone by the acoustics. Aurally and visually, there is literally not a bad seat in the house. I cannot recommend this jewel of LA highly enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodRichard
50,What a glorious experience,"Full disclosure: I have had season tickets to the Philharmonic, which plays at the Disney Hall, since the day they opened for business. It is a gorgeous facility, inside and out. The floral patterns in the carpet are an homage to Walt Disney's widow, who gave $50 million to build the concert hall. The lush gardens carry the same floral theme forward. As at any performance space, the music inside is not always fabulous, but I'm always glad I'm there. Go if you get the chance. Walk around outside for free if you can't buy a concert ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77
50,Walt Disney Concert Hall - Fantastic venue to see and hear live music,"I've seen classical, indy rock, and abstract avant-garde music performances at the Disney Concert Hall.

50,Amazing Architecture,If you love fantastic architecture and great music this can't be missed. If you just love the architecture that's fine too since you can just take a tour of the building with no square corners.

40,"Beautiful venue, exceptional acoustics, uncomfortable seats","We have been subscribers of the L A Philharmonic for many years. The orchestra is top-notch, the Hall is beautiful inside and out, the acoustics are supurb. BUT, there is poor legroom between the seats and I pity anyone who has long legs. It's like an airplane, the less you pay the less legroom and seatwidth you get. There are also audio or docent tours of the facility and these are very worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyCarolW

The building itself is world class, a architectural classic for the ages ! ! Go early so you can walk around and marvel at the shapes, curves, shadows, take your camera. Walk across to Grant Park and take photos from up close and afar. I had seats in the terrace section - row B seats 34 and 36 and they were perfect for a first time visitor. I could see everything and everyone. Gustavo Dudamel ! ! ! Bravo Bravo Bravo. And yes the acoustics are out of this world. The sounds, the notes, the music, it all carries throughout the hall with such clarity ! You can indeed hear a pin drop. Go to the presentation before the concert, usually one hour before where the line up of all the scores are explained in great detail. ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY ! Thanks to Lilian Disney and everyone who made the Disney Concert Hall possible - a Southern California treasure for the ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pequod77

50,"Neat Place, Even for Pics","We were there in the daytime, but it was worth a visit even just to gawk and take photos. Wish we were there for a concert, probably has amazing acoustics. Downtown was clean and super-cool to visit too... it's a very bustling, alive, clean and fun downtown compared to most cities! We took the red line subway train from our hotel in Hollywood to get there in about 12 minutes (traveling from Hollywood Stars Inn where we were staying on Sunset).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyc302
40,Great program with strange instructions from staff,"A spectacular building, anyone who likes modern architectural wonders must see the Walt Disney Concert Hall. A really bravely designed unusually formed building, and the concert hall is truly amazing with all the wood around including the wonderful organ. We went for a ""Casual Friday"" Brahms concert with star conductor Gustavo Dudamel and the fantastic pianist Emanuel Ax and it was great. What was embarrassing was all the instructions from the Concert Hall staff before the show: we arrived a little early and were wondering around in the beautiful building, wanted to take a photo of the concert hall when it was practically empty yet and one of the staff members came to us saying photography is prohibited in the Concert Hall. When I asked why, he said the organ design is with copyright.... Are we kidding....? I have photos of quite a number of opera buildings, concert halls, theatres around the world, and this was new news to me (after the concert I checked and there are many many photos of the organ on the web). Then we stood at the top of a staircase to look around, when another staff lady came to us saying we were not supposed to stand at the top of the staircase, shall stand somewhere else. What? And yes, she told the other two visitors the same. I am not sure why the staff can't let people be, this is unnecessary and only frustrates people without real reasons... this had an effect on the otherwise perfect experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761peterm
50,Fabulous,An experience not to be missed but book well in advance if there is someone special you want to see. Only comment is the acoustics are not as good as expected for such a prestigious place but lucky for us it didn't spoil the performance too much.

Each music piece was preceded by actor/actors who played out certain scenes from that particular play. The part of Romeo was played by none other than Orlando Bloom. Each actor was excellent and the orchestra was flawless, but the real star was the acoustics. The concert hall lives up to their reputation. Highly recommend that you attend a concert there, given the chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805deborahw
40,Hearing the pipe organ and Bach's St. John Passion at Disney Hall,"Enjoyed the marvelous sounds produced by the Los Angeles Master Chorale and Orchestra conducted by Grant Gershon in Bach's St. John Passion at Disney Hall. The hall is celebrating its 10th year of being open in 2013-14, and is definitely newer than some other famous concert halls, such as New York's Carnegie Hall, a favorite, or Philadelphia's Academy of Music, or Cleveland's Severance Hall or Los Angeles's Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. I paid extra to sit in an aisle area at Disney Hall in case I needed to make a hasty exit.Hearing the pipe organ at a special concert for the 2004 National Convention of the American Guild of Organists, the acoustics made a tremendous difference from one side to the other. The first half I felt that I was not hearing the best sounds from the fine Rosales/Glatter-Goetz pipe organ.. it was sometimes muffled. The second half, when I moved to the opposite side of the hall, I enjoyed hearing the organ with much more clarity.This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. If you have a really good seat, I am sure that you would give the Hall 5 stars.Before the concert, there was a talk by Grant Gershon, conductor of the LAMC, hosted by Alan Chapman from KUSC(the classical music station of USC in Los Angeles.) It was stimulating to hear the conductor's ideas about the work. There is a gift shop with a variety of souvenirs, CDs and books to tempt the musician and audience member. A buffet style restaurant is available in the Hall. Tickets are usually high priced; sometimes one may obtain a discounted price from the performing group or from Groupon.Parking costs at least $8, sometimes more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsBach

It is a breathtakingly beautiful building, and the creamy wooden interior is not only beautiful, it makes for perfect acoustics, no matter what the concert. My favorite concert was the estimable Hector Olivera, organist, who made those gorgeous post-moderne pipes rattle the building, and my soul.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/208kirkf
50,"Architecture, acoustics, and ambiance!","What more could you ask for? A great location in downtown LA, beautiful to look at inside and out.

Not the sort of building you come across every day so well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParqueTropical

However, we saw John Legend with his piano, a string quartet, and his arranger on guitar. Like John said, the intimate ambiance of this Hall was like being in his living room with 2200 other people immersed in the sound of his music.

At this point in our LA trip we understood that it's just easiest to park where you can find it and pay the freight! We took a guided tour as there was a matinee coming up and they were not allowing the self-guided tours that day. It was very interesting, free and worth the time if you like architecture.

50,A Fabulous Concert Hall,"My wife and I were going to see and hear a famous organist give a recital on the wonderful Disney Concert Hall organ, but before the concert, we were urged to attend the pre-concert presentation. This, we were informed, is usually given by someone knowledgeable of the performer, be it orchestra or individual. However, we were delighted to find that the organist herself, Ann Elise Smoot would subject herself to a Q & A with the audience. This was conducted in an anteroom for half an hour an hour prior to the performance. It was very fascinating, as she told stories of her own life, from Pennsylvania to two degrees at Yale, to the Royal College of Organists in England, where she met and married her husband. She talked about their 2-year old daughter, Emily. Emily and her parents now live in Windsor Castle, as Emily's father was recently appointed Music Director of the Chapel Royal in Windsor Castle.We walked all around this magnificent structure, started with money from the Disney family, but it took a long time to construct and substantially more monies were required to complete the edifice and the organ. The building itself reminded us of one of Disney's fantasy castles, as it has uneven ramparts providing views of the city. Also among the 'ramparts' are a fountain and a children's outdoor amphitheatre.Inside, it is opulent without being gaudy. It has many rooms, but the main concert hall is impressively large with a wild organ frontispiece looking like huge children's building sticks stuck into the stage floor.When the concert began, it was obvious that much attention to acoustic details had been given.It was a wonderful evening in a magnificent concert hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelvilleP_13
30,Amazing design by Frank Gehry,Certainly a different building overall. Very minimalistic. We were disappointed that you could not enter the actual concert hall. Spoiled it for us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/234Joost234
50,Free tour,We took the free audio self guided tour. I was totally amazed and moved by the design and story. Our only disappointment was not being able to see the main concert hall. The gardens were a lovely surprise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prairiegal523
50,Beautiful,Spectacular building with a modest sized concert hall. Frank Gehry masterpiece. Wonderful acoustics. Worth a tour if no performances scheduled.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suturedoc
50,Magnificent to see and experience,"We had an extended layover on our return trip from Hawaii and had 6+ hours to spend in LA and choose to come here. The building is simply a wonder to take in from practically every angle, mostly from the exterior. Inside there is a small but reasonable self-service cafeteria and a gift shop which sells some nice memorabilia for both the structure itself and the LA Philharmonic. Not to be missed if you are visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Volkolas
50,Beautiful venue,"This is the second time we have been to the Walt Disney Concert Hall and it was beautiful both times. We attended the Holiday Sing Along featuring Julie Andrews and were thrilled. The hall itself is beautiful and the acoustics are top notch. The ushers do a great job of making sure no photos are taken in the hall and they are very helpful getting you to your seats. The seats are ok for the average person, maybe a little tight for larger people. There isn't a bad seat in the house. We can't wait to go back for another show. The parking is very easy to find and escalators take you directly into the hall. This is a must see for anyone visiting Los Angeles if you are able.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveln4
50,Awesome!,"Having heard a concert in the evening, we decided to come back in daylight to see the building. It was a wonderful experience. We used the telephone style guide which meant we could stop and start at our leisure. After seeing the garden we decided to go down to buy some lunch from the café and bring it up to the garden to eat. Food was pleasant but not wonderful. Views from the garden were superb and there were various photo-shoots taking place, which were quite entertaining. The building is awesome. We particularly liked the colours of the chairs in the small hall and the wood interior was so warm and enveloping. Bravo to all involved in providing this marvellous building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMP49
40,Time on My hands,Expert selections and good food for the locale! Hot food and sandwiches with a wide selection to drink! Quick service and friendly atmosphere!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LongBeachTexasT
40,"Nice garden, friendly tour","The garden has been featured on TV, the visit is much like the TV show. We got a free tour by arranging in advance. The tour was informative, but the garden is accessible even when the building is closed, so it wouldn't have been necessary. We haven't heard a concert there, but I'l bet it would be great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_Jones2014
50,Terrific concert hall.,"The exterior of the building was only surpassed by the interior. The building and quality were extraordinary. WOW! The parking garage was convenience and made for easy access into the building. You must take a tour to see everything. Our guide was passionate and loved sharing her knowledge about the Disney family and the history of the music center. Highly recommended. Next time, I want to see a performance in the music center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy2645
40,Interesting building,Nice architecture. The building was interesting and unique. Parking was a challenge though because it is located in the downtown area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mutiaw
40,A very exciting experience!!!,"We're from Cancun, Mexico. So having the opportunity to see the whole orchestra live on stage is amazing.We purchased tickets on line for the All Brahms performance with members of the Los Angeles Philarmonic.With that said, we were looking foreward to an unforgettable evening of some of the finest music performed live.So it was impecable! The acustics of the place, the glamour, the settings and the magnificent seats we had. We even had a wine testing session at the hall by the entrance which was very nice.Our only disappointment was the number of the musicians performing!!! Only 3 in the first third (1 violin, 1 horn and 1 piano); only 4 musicians in the 2nd third (2 violins, a viola and a cello) and only 4 in the 3rd third (2 violin, 2 viola and 1 cello).We were expecting the whole orchestra!!! Maybe my fault for not checking deep in the program but I thought if you buy tickets for the Disney Concert Hall's All-Brahms concert, you get the whole enchilada haha...However, I cannot say we had an amazing time (my wife was more disappointed than I was). Going to one of this concerts is a must do if you visit Los Angeles. Check on the program though... :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/349miguelb
50,Impressive building,"We take a side trip visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the tour is free last for 1 hour, the tour guide give us very detail tour, very interesting architecture , we learn a lot about the sound proof concert hall, the colorful floral carpet, don't miss the outdoor garden - giant blue rose sculpture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purpletravler
50,Maria Rita concert,"I just went to see bossa nova concert by Maria Rita. This Concert Hall is amazing, it doesnt matter where you sit you will always have a nice view of the performace. The stage in right on the middle of the stadium therefore the views are amazing from every way. The architecture is amazing and it looks that is form out of this world",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therealtrue
50,Architecture at its best!,"On a Grand Tour of LA, we were mesmerized by a surprise view of The Walt Disney Concert Hall - wish we could have seen the interior! Such a statement!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S8663OTlaurah
50,Amazing!!!!,"We did the self-guided tour that meant we could go at our own pace. The exterior of the building is just incredible. The interior was such a surprise, full of beautiful timber and soaring ceilings.......just fantastic. Well worth the visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynA536
40,Interesting,"I went there because my brother is an archi student. I am not so interested at architectures but this building blows my mind. It looks different at different angles and the way they curved the titanium is impressive.We did not take the tour but simply walking around is good enough. The reason why I did not give it a 5 star is because there are too many tourists. I had to wait till everybody left to get a good photo taken. But then another group of tourists arrived..Anyhow, I would recommend visiting this place. It is very impressive and interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cottoncarmen
50,A whale of a visit,Free walking tour of the concert hall's interiors (but not the auditorium itself) and the 3rd level gardens. A beautiful place inside and out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peter515
50,"Amazing acoustics, the garden, the LAPhil and John Adams too!","The Disney doesn't have a grand staircase and giant Chagalls, but it has some of the best acoustics in the world. Made of warm inviting wood on the side and gleaming steel curve on the outside, the Disney Hall is welcoming and practical. The intimacy of the hall makes you feel part of an audience, rather than like those big barns from the sixties. My husband and I grab some sushi from Bristol Farms and have dinner before the concert in the garden which wraps itself around the building a story and a half above the street and has the most amazing views of downtown Los Angeles. Or, we eat in the cafe in the basement. The LA Phil, Choral music, chamber music, frank zappas 200 Motels - There's something for everyone at the Disney Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57sharond
50,"Wonder of modern architecture, and superb acoustics","Visited this during my birthday. Had a private tour of the building and was able to see it all, inside out.Definitely worth listening to a music program if you are able to get tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taco_Connosieur
50,Lovely concert hall with a great resident orchestra,"I have been aLos Angeles Philharmonic season ticket holder since Disney hall opened. I have sat in every section of the hall. The acoustics of this hall are fabulous in every seat. If you like classical music you must attend a concert here. If you are over 65 or a student you can get RUSH tickets for concerts for $10. My daughter got a ticket in the fifth row. Call before the concert to see if there are RUSH tickets available. When inside, walk around this beautiful building. Be sure to check the fountain in the garden. The building represents a sailing ship. There are also windows with great views from the upper windows. They offer tours of the building which do not require a ticket but going to a concert is the best way to see this building. All in all Disney Hall is a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
50,Something new for Halloween,"We joined a few friends and made our way to the Disney concert hall. They were projecting ""Phantom of the Opera"" accompanied by a live pipe organ. To see this classic film and hear the most amazing live score on Halloween was the perfect way to celebrate. The place was packed and it looks like every seat in the house is a good one. We enjoyed this unique experience very much. Some people in the audience dressed up, others just came in jackets and ties. It was a grown up evening and the ticket price was more than fair. We liked it so much I think we will return next year. This was our first visit and the programming seemed to have something for everyone. The place is beautiful and if you haven't been, be sure to check it out. This is a must on a visit to Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welovetravelsf
50,Spectactular building,This building does leave you gobsmacked. How did anyone think to build anything like this? If you are a fan of abstract photography you will love this building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH
50,Beautiful,"It truly is a work of art, architecturally speaking.The concert was fabulous! Loved the experience of enjoying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pilivds
30,Stunning building/Horribly uncomfortable seating,"OMGoodness, the place is wonderful, but they totally forgot about ""form and function"" when they designed the ""cheap"" seats. They are bench seats, w/backs that are at a 90 degree angle to the seats. Your feet are right behind the necks of the people in front of you. There is no leg room if you are tall, or larger than small. Everyone, young, old, thin, good-postured, no one was comfortable, everyone was fidgeting in their seats. AND if you sat in the top two rows, in regular seats, you COULD NOT HEAR the orchestra. ONE interesting/excellent thing, when you sit in the cheap seats you are sitting facing the conductor, really cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiFran
40,very interesting building,we only visited inside the building while being in LA and it is a pretty impressive one. Hope to be back there to see performance. we had a lunch there and it is pretty yummy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olaBrisbane
30,A site to behold...but the tour does not take you in the concert hall,"Short visit, was not interested in the program being offered at nite in the concert hall, so we opted for the tour. The docent new his stuff. The tour consisted of seeing the added venues on the property. Found out 3/4 full that we would not see the inside of the concert hall, so we bowed out of the rest of the tour. The structure of the Concert Hall is a site to see. The walkway and the observation tower are stunning. My friend (who lives in LA) enjoyed the tour too. He indicated that it was so nice to see the building when not bustling with people. It was very enjoyable. But again, if you expect to get into the concert hall...it is not happening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sbenjamen
50,Catch the LA Phil and get a cheap thrill!,"We sat in the cheap seats behind the orchestra. I initially had some doubts, but they soon evaporated. We were in the second row just 20 feet from the musicians and totally immersed in the music, which was so very involving and exciting to hear this close up. It’s as close as I’ll ever get to being in the orchestra! We enjoyed watching the interaction between the great Emanuel Ax and the orchestra, and watching the direction by conductor Robin Ticciati. If I lived in LA, I’d be there for every concert!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rick_in_San_Diego
50,The free tour is fun with informative docents,"We completely enjoyed our tour of the concert hall and found all the tidbits about the place very interesting. We even got to sneak in when a rehearsal for something was about to start so you could see all the activity. It's nice when they can let you in to see the actual theater (b/c I believe sometimes they can't, depending on what's going on that day.) We were surprised this was free over all and would do it again. Make this place a part of a fuller downtown LA field trip and it's worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikki777
50,Fascinating,Really great building and concert space. The tour with headphones is well worth doing and it's completely free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caram61
50,Fabulous ...but NO taxis,"Be warned that taxis do not wait outside in anticipation of the concert's crowd exiting & looking for a ride. Really -- are most visitors locals with their own transport? We were there in Dec, arrived by taxi from our hotel and assumed it would easy to grab a cab after the concert --- NONE, zero. Could not believe it -- had to walk back. Weird, so be warned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outoford
40,Another Ghery project,"We've seen other Ghery buildings before so weren't awed by the exterior but can understand why others might be. There is no question that it stands apart from the other buildings in the Music Center, or in the entire L.A. area for that matter, and you are either a fan of this kind of architecture, or you hate it. The tours of the interior don't usually include the concert hall itself, but it was open the day we visited and someone was practicing on an organ. The visual layout itself is a bit distracting but the acoustics are amazing - it felt like the music was going right through our bodies. I wish the orchestra had been performing while we were in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChubbyElf
50,Beautiful place for a concert,We attended a New Years Eve concert with Sergio Mendes and Sheila E. Great Acoustics and also very beautiful architect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TapsGrange
40,great architect,"The Frank Gehry designed building has many angles to explore outside and little gardens and fountains tucked here and there around the exterior. I didn't take a building tour inside, but it is worth knowing that the restrooms inside were available for use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshhikes
50,Magnificent !!!!,"This concert hall was designed by noted architect Frank Gehry (of Guggenheim in Bilbao fame) BEFORE he designed the Guggenheim. The stainless steel skin and undulating curves are similar. The building relates well to its surroundings in downtown LA--near the Dorothy Chandler Pavalion and the Mark Taper Forum, but is a wonder in and of itself. I particularly loved the juxtaposition of the steel and concrete with the beautiful, soft, textural, and fragrant garden plantings, which are hidden from view to anyone driving by--you must be in the inner courtyard to even know that this lovely garden exists--and it makes the building that much more remarkable and beautiful, as well as defining the human scale of the project. Everyone in our party loved every element of the audio tour describing the architectural details,with John Lithgow's melifluous tones, and the added enriched commentary by Diane Disney, Walt's daughter, as well as Mr. Gehry himself. We all loved every element of this building except for the carpeting, named Lillian, for Walt Disney's widow, who worked with Mr. Gehry on the design. I attribute this misstep to the fact that Mr. Gehry wanted to appease Mrs. Disney, and tried the best he could to be as innofensive as possible with the ultimate design. She wanted the carpet to be floral, and he compromised with an abstract floral, however, it still doesn't quite work in the space. No matter--the rest of the elements are all right on target--a masterpiece.You simply must tour this building while in L.A.Although a minor part of the building and the audio tour is an exhibit from the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. on Danny Kaye and his talented wife, Sylvia Fine, it was revelatory about these geniuses, their gifts, accomplishments and their charitable natures. It was wonderful to learn that Danny Kaye, who played numerous wonderful roles in the theatre and the movies, including as Walter Mitty the first time ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" was a movie, was also the first Ambassador of Goodwill for UNICEF! This exhibit alone, was worth the trip--but go for all of the wonderful design elements. They have a beautiful gift shop with fabulous art and music on sale, and a cafe as well, and the building is open to the public for the free audio tour during normal operating hours, which vary, so call or check on line for more info.We parked right across the street on a parking meter, so there is no excuse not to go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reginalampert
50,Wonderful venue for music,"Great acoustics and lovely venue. Parking is difficult and expensive downtown, but it's worth it on occasion. The building is a must see as it's quite unusual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892LindaW
50,Excellent guided tours,"As one of the famous buildings in Los Angeles, we decided to visit it. They have a free guided tour that shows and explains you the details of Frank Ghery project. You can walk out and inside the building loking and understanding that master piece of the modern architecture. You have to take it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GustavoBuenosAires
50,A wonderful concert in a state of the art concert hall.,The acoustics of the Walt Disney Concert Hall were incredible. The orchestra's rendering of the concert version of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quertosomo
40,first impressions are not always true,"Although the outside of this building is mesmerizing, upon entrance the lack of elevative uplifting structural presence can confuse you-and that is the only problem with this place: the entrance--a little claustrophobic. The dining area is also jaggedy and confusing. The music hall itself is as good as it should be but after the entrance it is extreme. Obviously the external design is a masterpiece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julial771
50,do not miss,"I would rate this venue as the Number One attraction in LA. You need to do two things. No. 1, take a guided tour of the facility with a real person-----they are offered for free at 1:00 p.m. some days of the week. (but you will not step into the concert hall). No. 2, you must attend a performance in the concert hall to experience the best acoustics of any concert hall in the world---it does make a difference. No. 3, you must go to the Criminal Justice Building across the street and take the elevator to the 9th floor to the food service area and step out to the balcony and view the concert hall from there----it is the best view of the downtown area and contrasts the graceful stainless steel curves of the concert hall with the monolithic columns of skyscrapers in the background. This is my favorite building in all of California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Continent8
50,Scheherazade – wow!,"First time to the Disney Hall and hopefully not the last. The LA Philharmonic performance of Scheherazade was fabulous, and the Hall is a true masterpiece. Beautiful venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Isle-to-Isle
50,AMAZING SOUND!!,This is without a doubt the best place to catch classical music.. The music just fills this place. I will for sure visit again when I am back in town,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623biancaj
50,Stylish,what an architecture and accoustics ! just fantastic and so easy to get along with ample parking in the same building. Great - we enjoyed the concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vima2
50,one of the best places in the world to hear music,"No doubt, one of the best places in the world to hear music. From resident companies LAPhil and LA Master Chorale to special events, there is no better place to hear a concert. A great pipe organ, and the hall is as nice to look at as to listen to music in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedml
50,So cool,"As a fan of architecture this was a must see for me. I was not disappointed, this Frank Gehry masterpiece is simply stunning.I viewed it just from the outside and still feel in love with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EXgeMMy
50,Best concerts performed in resplendent building,"As a keen fan of high-quality musical performances I was simply stunned when saw Walt Disney Concert Hall for the first time. Not only it looks really impressive and contemporary, but also the interior makes you feel a little bit more special about your day. The concerts in Walt Disney Hall are of a great variety yet you can be sure that the sound of performance and comfort of audience will be provided in the best possible quality. I really enjoyed my time there and will certainly visit it again on my next trip to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ronnie_O_B
50,Frank Gehry is Love,An absolute feast to the eye of architecture enthusiast like me. I could spend the whole day admiring the design.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ONEROSSCOLLADO
50,"Beautiful architecture, amazing acoustics","Situated atop Bunker Hill, close to the financial district of downtown L. A. and almost across from the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the mind- boggling architecture of the Disney Concert Hall has become a landmark of Los Angeles and is not to be missed. Even if you don’t have the time to go inside and enjoy the exquisite acoustics during a concert, or just to admire the beautiful décor, you can use the stairs outside to go from one side of the building to the top and then down on the other side. The inside tour could be enhanced with the help of an audio self guide; check the website for free, live guided tours. At the street level there is a very good gift shop and “Patina” Café/Restaurant - good for a coffee, a cold drink or a lunch. If you have the time, another LA landmark, the City Hall, is about 10 minutes away on foot, going right on the 1st Street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldnomad_01
50,Great venue,"The music here is always top notch. The venue itself is worth the visit. We have even taken visitors here just to see the outside, it is that special. They have a great gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgalambos
40,Getting Into Music Mode at the Disney Concert Hall,It is always good to listen to good music. It relaxes and puts you in a good mood. The architecture of the hall is modern but blend well with its surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosannaV228
50,A must-see and if you have time a must-hear,Los Angeles is a vast city with so many wonderful attractions to occupy your time. The only way to complete your trip is a visit to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The grounds are beautiful with walkways that take you up and around the outside of the structure and leads you to different gardens.Take some time to buy tickets for the LA Phil. The acoustics are terrific!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PasadenaLion
50,an architechtual gem,"This is the best of downtown LA. Make sure you bring your camera. If possible attend a concert, the acoustics are amazing and there is no bad seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annel692
40,Beautiful place to hear music,The Disney Concert is beautiful inside and outside. The acoustics are great no matter where you are seated. The ushers are very thoughtful and helpful. One has several parking options including parking under Disney Hall for $8.00. Very easy getting in however getting out tends to jam up. You pay going in. There are seats that might be considered in the nose bleed area it is of course a matter of price. This venue in not cheap but they do have some outstanding and varied performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burnied
50,What Concert-Going is All About,"The hall is incredible, the acoustics wonderful, the parking more than adequate, the public transportation available (with a little effort) and the concerts are well-chosen, well-staged and well-received. This cultural icon shows that LA is a serious part of high culture in America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321georgem
50,What a venue,"I had an hour to kill on the day I was leaving LA. The Walt Disney Concert hall has a self guided audio tour you can do in and around the hall. What an incredible building. If you are interested in architecture, green structures or just interesting buildings, consider walking around here. It is so not what you would think. There is the main concert hall, gardens, outdoor amphitheaters and other interesting spaces. It was interesting to listen to what went into the hall and some of the spaces and designs. I would actually like to go back and see a program in the main auditorium which is not included on the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLB125
30,more of a sculpture than a building,"Could only visit this from the outside, but it is a real cornucopia of geometry and metal plating. The architectural quality unfortunately is not great when you look at the building up close... but from a distance it is truly a wacky building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canswiss
30,Grand Architecture,"I visited LA in 2011. The tour bus stayed here for 10 minutes. I never had a chance to walk in. However, its design is cutting-edge. Different shades of day light could be reflected from the metal panels at different angles. As a Disney fan, and as an admirer of Walt Disney himself, I stood looking at this spectacular building and felt awed. One which can be ranked the top 500 contemporary structures in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neverlandalice
50,An Amazing Experience,"This is the home of The Los Angeles Master Chorale. In itself it is an architectural wonder. A magnificent structure. But architecture alone is not enough, as they say- the proof is in the pudding- and the hall itself surpasses the exterior. I have sat literally in every section there is- from the side terraces, to front, middle orchestra to the very last back row and yes, even at the back of the orchestra facing the conductor and the acoustics were all equally phenomenal. To listen to The LA Master Chorale- directed by Mr. Grant Gershon is one of the best musical experiences you will have.Enjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nili99
50,"Did not go in, but outside garden was nice","Besides the amazing architecture to be seen in this building, there are spaces around the building that you can walk around in. They have a small garden on one side and stairs that go from one side of the building to the other all while outside. You can easily spend a half hour here as there are many great photos that can be taken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Stylish venue for wonderful music,"We were lucky enough to be taken to hear the LA Philharmonic playing at the Hall's 10th Anniversary concert. A beautiful spacious building with lots of glowing golden wood, marvellous auditorium acoustics and outdoor balcony gardens for the interval. Your experience will probably be as good as the programme you hear - ours was wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterL861
50,Amazing Venue with Amazing Acoustics,Just to see the amazing achritechture is worth the visit. Any musical performance will prove the true genious of this building. The design delivers amazing sound. It looks so amazing and I did not expect to discover how functional the music hall is designed. Easy parking under the complex nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMcClureDVM
40,Beatiful,"Would love to go back for the free tour, unfortunately we didn't have enough time. But from the outside, it is a really stunning piece of architecture and close to the art museum. Hope to get back for the tour and to see a concert some day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wegoplaces4589
50,"exquisite sound, performances, architecture","We have been to a few concerts here ove the years and have loved every moment inside and peering at the outside of the building alike. A great LA gathering place. The patina cafe inside is great for a quick bite, and the real Patina restaurant is beautifully done and worth the splurge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evilexis
50,Beautiful concert hall; free and informative tour,"We visited the Walt Disney Concert Hall on a Sunday morning. We took the subway to the Civic Center from Hollywood, which was quick, easy, and inexpensive. It was a short walk to the concert hall.The Walt Disney Concert Hall has amazing architecture. The building is beautifully constructed. Guided tours are offered most days and are free of charge. Our tour guide was very nice and knowledgeable about the hall's construction. The tour took about 45 minutes. It was interesting to learn about the history of the hall and how it was designed and constructed.As others have noted, you do not get to go in the concert hall. While we were on the tour there was an organist practicing. We were shown a live video feed. It would have been a nicer tour if we actually could have gone in the hall, but I understand that performers need to practice without interruption. The tour was still enjoyable without actually going in the hall as there's so much beautiful architecture to see outside the hall.Note that tours are not offered every day, and they're only offered a certain times. Check the schedule on the web site before visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radx4
40,Unfortunately no music.,Another beautiful building with interesting details like a beautiful garden on the balcony. I would have love to hear the sound of music in such a beautiful concerthall.

50,Amazing!,"Such a beautiful building, inside and out; but in a strange location.I don't think there is a bad seat inside, and the music was amazing. I couldn't believe how relaxing the evening was.The champagne is a little over-priced, even for L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jewels_Travels
50,Concerts at Disney Hall,There is parking provided and the concert hall is beautiful. A must while you are in California. There is also food and drinks/cocktails available for purchase.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/njcrocker
50,One of the Seven Wonders,It's a Frank Gehry building (not unlike the Museum in Bilbao and much the same design)It is a must see when in Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David82605
40,"Fantasic building, short changed with concert","Incredible building and stunning auditorium and the LA Phil sounded amazing, acoustics first rate. However we paid $107 dollars per ticket and only go 1 hour of concert - we felt very short changed indeed - check the programme carefully. However that said this is worth a look as it is an impressive construction.We went on casual Friday so orchestra and audience were very dressed down and atmosphere very accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuneHerts
40,Great architecture,"Didn't have the opportunity to see the insides, but it's a beautiful building to admire from the outside too.Although I should say, I only went looking because I was in the neighborhood. Combine it with the contemporary museum just down the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyP247
50,Beautiful architecture,"This Frank Gehry creation is absolutely beautiful. The design is unique and the use of metal gives its facade a stunning look. Inside is spacious and with excellent acoustics, which can be felt even if -as in our case- we were during daytime and there was not a concert. The pipe organ is magnificent. A must visit place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rgkattan
40,Visually Stunning,Only viewed this magnificent building from outside but was mightily impressed. Next time in LA I will definitely try to see a concert.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarEastTraveller33
50,Penultimate Acoustics in the US,I love Classical/ Concert Hall music. By now everyone knows that the Frank Gehry architecture is AMAZING. What everyone may not know is the acoustics (I guess in my less than humble opinion) is the best in America. Treat yourself to a concert there even if the program during your trip is not your favorite. I think it is the ultimate in live music experience.

50,Not a bad seat in the place,"Loved, loved the WDCH. Stunning to look at inside and out. We saw the LA Philharmonic and sat in the front row of the balcony-- fantastic. I don't think there's a bad seat in the place-- my advice is to buy the cheapest tickets you can. The acoustics are phenomenal anywhere, and the venue is small enough that even in the last row of the balcony you wouldn't be far away (plus you'd get to view the gorgeous architecture). The seats BEHIND the stage looked fun too-- you'd feel like you were in the orchestra.By the way, it was fun to come early and just wander around the venue. Nice rooftop garden, a talk going on, available cocktails... very, very nice! I'm jealous that I don't live in LA, especially since on Halloween they're showing Lon Chaney's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA accompanied by their magnificent organ. That would be an experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerminusEst
50,Worth a look,If you are downtown LA give the concert hall a visit. Outstanding architecture and you can wander around the foyer without charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orkneycat
50,Exquisite Concert Venue,If you ever get the chance to attend a concert here - do it. The place is wonderful to walk through and around. The hall is so elegant feeling and the LA Symphony... expuisite! The splurge is worth it. Make an afternoon or evening of it - dress up and enjoy. Parking right downstairs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAOnTheRoadAgain

Great place to visit. Loved the gift shop, great christmas tree ornaments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinigal67
50,Wanted to see a Frank Gehry Building,"Ever since I saw photos of the Frank Gehry-designed museum in Bilbao, Spain, I have always wanted to see one of his buildings in the flesh, as it were. This dream became a reality when we visited the Walt Disney Concert Hall last week in Los Angeles, California. And it was well worth the wait. Not only is the exterior magnificent as I was sure it would be, with its gleaming panels reminiscent of a ship in full sail, but the interior is breathtaking. Inside the hall you are enveloped in the warm burnt sienna/ochre color of the wooden walls and roof, hardly a straight line anywhere but lots of elegant curves. It's warm and magnificent at the same time, and the organ pipes are a masterpiece in contrast--instead of straight up and down pipes, they are all at angles to each other like pick-up sticks in free fall. The overall effect as you wait for the music is that you're in a reversed tallship. We were up in what used to be called the gods and almost as far back as it was possible to be, and yet it was easy to see the platform and the musicians, and the acoustics are superb. This was definitely a peak experience, and the music, all Beethoven, was performed superbly by members of the LA Philharmonic in small chamber groups. Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneS53
50,"Music, Tours and More","The Walt Disney Concert Hall is celebrating its 10th anniversary with spectacular specials for a variety of events this season. Tours during the day are free, and the Red Line subway is only a block away. Hike the stairs outside to find hidden amphitheatres and a garden with a unique fountain. Linger with a picnic lunch or make it a quick stop during a longer downtown day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb

40,L.A. Downtown must see,"It was a great place to visit regardless if you live in L.A. or not. We came for a concert one evening, first time ever and it was very nice. Easy parking nearby, around $8, safe and walking distance. Arrive early so that you can walk around the concert hall, one of the most places people would come for wedding photos, therefore you should come and check it out yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kitty-hello
50,Absolutely incredible. Beautiful beyond words.,"This place is so wonderful, you just have to see it for yourself to believe it. It is so beautiful, so moving, so incredible that words cannot possibly do it justice. I did the guided audio tour and took a long time to see this place. You need at least an hour to go though the automated, free audio tour. So grateful to have seen this most impressive world landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnK662

40,try and see the secret garden if the weather is good!,"our friend really wnated to check this place out so we went for a nose round- there were not any shows on a t the time so we had a mosey round the gift shop where my friend spent some time chosing the right musical note ornament for her christmas tree! have some unique gift ideas there but some of it i found to be overpriced, while in the gift shop i found a book with places and things to do in the area and the concert hall was mentioned with a hint as to a roof top garden- if you come out of the gift shop and turn right you should see some steps up to this garden which is well worth a vsit if the weather is good- wonderful views and such a peacful place- has some tables and chairs dotted about if you wanted to get a coffe and sit and read a book and geta away from it all would recoomend this place- was no one else up there when we went as well- blissful! if only we had our swimming costumes we would have sat in the lovely lotus fountain as it looked so inviting on a hot day! we settled for our hands having a dip instead. :p",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimiquinn
50,"Unique, Get away from Riff-raff, and into Cultured Peace","I like coming here for jazz concerts and symphonies. I feel I'm actually part of a civilized culture, compared to the ghetto attitude we all have to pretend is somehow ""equal"" or ""superior."" If more people came here, they'd realize music could also be art. This building is a place of inspiration and awe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MitsoukoRussie
40,Vintage Gehry,An enjoyable free visit with a good audio as guide. We were lucky that the theatre was open and we got to see it which isn't usually the case.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MjM247
40,Great venue for world music,"I'm a world music subscriber for the last five years. The acoustics is spot on, mostly when the performers recognize how special WDH is. It's built to amplify and project the performer's voice without a lot of reverb or distortion. Even the seats in the very back ""nose bleed"" section is very good. Seating in back of the orchestra still sounds good, but you see a lot of backs. Parking is easy. It can be a bit confusing as to what floor you're on, but there's always a space. Dress code is business casual for most concerts. You can grab a drink or a bite to eat inside at the cafe or bar. The World Music selection is a good grab bag of different musical styles. I've also attended other baroque, organ, and other classical series. It's an experience that is nice to have in the heart of downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N00dleW
40,Take the Symphonian tour!,"If you have time, definitely take the Symphonian tour! It covers all four venues, including the Ahmanson Theatre, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Mark Taper Forum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. I had a good time admiring the architecture and the feature that our tour guide pointed out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjoelseow
50,Great music in a great venue,"I've attended two Symphony performances at Disney Hall and both times was amazed at the exceptional sound quality and the performance of the symphony and soloist(s). Beethoven is my favorite and hearing his ""Missa Solemnis"" performed lived was an experience I'll never forget. It's my favorite Beethoven piece and hearing and experiencing it in such a marvelous venue was truly a treat. I hope to go back again soon.Parking was easy - just across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLS5775
50,Trip to LA? Do not miss the Disney Concert Hall,"This venue is absolutely exquisite. Parking is easy, plentiful and organized for a downtown venue. The structure is a marvel and just gets better and better. Easy to find photos of the interior, but you really do have to experience to feel the wonder and magic of the hall. The wood is absolutely alive, like a living cathedral to sound. I sit center, about five rows back, which are excellent seats, but the venue does not seem to have a bad seat. Regardless of where you sit, I cannot imagine it not being intimate.Do not miss the talks in the corridor, prior to the performance. So worth arriving early. You will hear the history behind the piece that will be performed, and have question and answer. It truly enriches the entire experience that follows.I would suggest arriving quite early downtown, having an elegant meal near by (reservations a must), then sauntering over for a pre-performance illuminating q&a.We have such a jewel here. Perhaps bring someone that has never been, to introduce them to the experience. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276amandaa
50,Free admission - wonderful building,Great free tourist attraction wonderful building inside & out with good views over downtown.

50,Fantastic Building and Views,Amazing building and after climbing what seems a staircase to heaven the views were worth it. Great gift shop too. A must if you have a chance to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/164traceyc
40,External view is much grand than what would appeared inside,"My sister and I took our parents and uncle's family from Australia here for a string String Quartet. The concert hall was nice but to my surprise, it was proportionally much smaller than its exterior facet (just an observation, nothing negative about that). I was happy with their snack bar as the food selection was decent and sold by the weight. I came straight from work, so it was nice to be able to grab a bite without paying an arm and a leg for decent food in such a nice venue. It was a nice experience being there, but I think would have been even more great if I chose to attend a piano concert instead of string.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HaL143

50,Frank Gehry's design is fantastic - and so was the concert!,"LOVED the architecture. gorgeous outside. concert was beautiful - and it fit into our incredibly busy schedule, as we were there for a series of parties. Gift shop is terrific. did all my souvenir shopping there. only disappointment was the the Dude (Gustavo Dudamel) wasn't conducting at this concert. quite a magnificent building",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari0nP

Throughout the tour, you'll go and learn about the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Ahmanson Theatre, the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion, and the Mark Taper Forum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheKidCritic
50,Impressive!!!,"I had the opportunity of visiting the outside area of Walt Disney Concert Hall when visiting LA downtown, and must I say, how incredible this place is! The silver-color walls are astonishing and beautiful to look from far and close. You can walk up the stairs on the side and reach a place that is cozy with flowers and some seats to have a meal. I was only sad that I didn´t book a tour to visit the inside area before going there but I´ll certainly do that next time I go to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaM479
50,Chamber Music at the Disney Hall with Wine Reception,"Principal Concertmaster Martin Chalifour is amazing on the violin, and if you haven't been to the Walt Disney Concert Hall before, designed by Frank Gehry, you are missing out. An incredible piece of American architecture, this building is one of a kind inside and out. The acoustics have been carefully tuned so that every seat in the house has great sound, and the chamber music series is relatively inexpensive for the world class music you get to hear. Not only that, but there is a complimentary wine reception before every chamber music event (two series, CH1 and CH2) for subscribers. Highly worth the trip to downtown LA to see the space and hear the sublime music of the Los Angeles Philharmonic musicians playing in a more intimate setting. Recommended without reservations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573gregs
50,Excellent concert venue,"Sang at a concert here in 2009 which was unforgettable. The hall has great acoustics and a very varied set of concerts to suit all tastes.

50,The Best Show in LA,"My favorite concert hall in LA, and I live in LA. It might look a bit awkward from outside (typical Frank Gehry architecture) but I like it. When you go inside the concert hall it is all covered with cherry colored wood, and the acoustic is supposed to be one of the best in the world.If you bring into account that you will listen to LA Philharmonic with Dudamel conducting it, or the Master Choral which is supposed to be the best in the world, or a mixture of both, what are you waiting for if you like classical music??? By the way they also have special concerts for world music which I love also.Try to make reservations ahead of time, a lot of the concerts will be sold out if you wait for the last minute. You can reserve on-line and the tickets will wait for you at the box office",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tirza_ha
40,Great building,I was breathless & stunned when I saw this building from afar but more when I was closer. It was just beautiful and the view from the top was just great. Sad thing was I was not able to go inside coz it was closed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maan24
40,Stunning theather,"Beautiful building inside and out. Self-guided (free) audio tour is informative but quick.

50,Worth Checking Out!,"You cannot be in the Downtown area of LA and not notice the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The place is truly stunning. We tried to do the audio tour, but missed it by 10 minutes as it closes at 2pm.

(Useful tip: Sometimes you can get deals with ""Rush tickets"" at a fraction of full-price)It is a beautifully designed hall with great acoustics.During intermission we always go out to the roof-top garden to catch a breath of fresh air,view the flowers and gaze at the city-scape. Music, culture and nature all together - what afine combination!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Kells
40,Take it all in.,"While there is almost nothing like a performance here, I was lucky enough to visit during a rehearsal. The acoustics are legendary, and I felt certain they could hear me breath, as well as I could hear the quietest notes of the tuning cello. The cafe features a wide variety of deliciously quick items, and while not cheap, the quality is immediately apparent. Rather than eat here, take your food outside, upstairs, to the garden in the back. What a delightful piece of peace in the busy downtown area. The water baths your mood, and is as soothing as the herbs scattered through the garden. Parking: This is no place for people on a budget to park! We found better parking at meters, several building away, near the court buildings, on a Sunday. Quick Art Sighting: Do be sure to checkout the courtyard of MOCA, across the street, even if you don't go into the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christina_onthe_road

50,The Sydney Opera House of L.A.,"One of the signature architectural monuments of L.A. Designed by Frank Gehry (after the Bilbao Museum), sonic design inside by Yasuhiro Toyota (Sapporo Concert Hall), you have to attend a concert here to get the amazing clarity of sound (if you're lucky, Gustavo Dudamel conducting the L.A. Philharmonic). The building is open to the public, and surrounded by gardens and fountains. On a sunny day, the glare glinting off the stainless steel can be blinding. I was there (in black tie) the night this was inaugurated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalhasa
40,intresting tour and its free,"We got the metro down town and spent a few hours exploring the area. At first the Concert Hall looked closed but on closer inspection we found the doors were unlocked. I nice lady explaned we could do a tour of the building using handsets, cool.

50,Gehry's jewel,"I adore this building!There are things to delight the eye around every corner, inside and out. The hall is magnificent too, in a totally different way- warm woods vs shimmery metals. If you can't afford the concerts, or just not interested, take the tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suz91101
50,Over the top beautiful and incredible architecture,"The hall is an architectural gem that was constructed with incredible detail and blow away by the difficultly to create a simple stainless steel panel. The inside of the concert hall is acoustically perfect and every seat is a great seat. Recommend going to the garden level and seeing the rose constructed with broken plates. If you have performed tile work for your home and you see this tile job, you will be blown away. It is the biggest puzzle I have ever seen and the grout lines, spacing, and level of detail is incredible. It is the nicest work of art I have ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ToddB252

40,Great Concert Venue,"I had a very enjoyable time during my visit to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. I attended the Lang Lang concert in May 2013 with my boyfriend. We are both fans of Lang Lang and were thrilled to find out he was going to be playing a concert at the WDCH during our vacation in LA . The facility is beautifully designed. The acoustics in the concert hall were also top notch. As a former viola player who's participated in my fair share of orchestra concerts, I was very impressed with the sound quality in this facility as well as the layout of the concert hall. There really didn't seem to be a ""bad seat"" in the entire concert hall. I am looking forward to visiting the WDCH again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docsurglace
40,Roof top garden,It was a great place to visit in downtown. Obviously a historic place to visit. Only regret is that I was not able to take the self-guided tour (hours for self-guided tours are only between 12 noon and 2:30 PM),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidban
50,The building has become a monument,"The outside of this building belies the interior. If you are a classical music lover this is a must, otherwise enjoy the outside. It is a few blocks from the modern art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc
50,Great Family Music Experience,"I have been to the Disney Concert Hall four times and have toured it twice with Girl Scouts. The concert hall, inside and out, exudes architural pleasures second to none. The acoustics are wonderful. We have had seats behind the orchestra and high up to the side . . still a great experience. Their family offerings are very much appreciated by our family. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885janeth885
50,Make time for this modern architectural landmark,"In this hub of the entertainment world surely the Walt Disney Hall stands out. The architecture is striking in so many ways. Take the daytime audio tour to appreciate all the nuances of the building. It's free & takes an hour or so. Then book a performance to experience the full effect of how architecture can enhance your enjoyment of music. At the performance of the LA Symphony Orchestra I understood the comments I've heard through the years of how ""bright"" music could sound. It seemed that every note was clear & beautiful. No doubt the orchestra & conductor were responsible for most of that, but I think the building made it possible. Don't worry about where you sit. It will be spectacular no matter where. And you can go early & have a nice light meal at their cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolshodge
50,"Amazing Place, whether as Performer or Patron","Several years ago, I had the honor of singing here with my college's choir. It was ironic that the first time I ever entered the building was coming here to represent my college in Indiana, even though I am an Angelino from birth ;-)In 2010, after I had come back to L.A. finally to plant roots again, I got to see the L.A. Phil perform there with a friend's kind invitation. The acoustics were as perfect from the seats as they had been in the front, more than five years earlier! Not to mention the wondrous interior. A controversial edifice to some, there is much more going for it in my mind",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybelle08
50,Grand Hall! Not a bad seat in the house,"I went with my sisters to a concert. The acoustics were amazing! We bought the cheapest seats which put us in the ""nosebleed"" area in the very back. But we felt like we were just fine Its always better to be closer in any concert but if we had to be in the back this was the place to do it. Seats were pretty comfortable. Staff was courteous and helpful. For some reason our ticketmaster separated our group by one seat. That was annoying but no one ended up in that seat so we all just moved over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnysout
50,A highlight of LA,"Make sure you do the free self-guided tour of this incredible Frank Gehry building! The audio is fabulous - succint and very interesting indeed. You will hear from the architect, the project manager, designers, the Disney family etc. etc. The views of the city from the roof garden are wonderful too and the garden is incredible. We were lucky that the auditorium was open on the day we visited :)Lunch at the cafe was delicious and very reasonably priced too.This was definitely a highlight of our trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S0rrelS

50,A must see in Los Angeles,The hall is a must see. The wood is spectacular. The sound is excellent anywhere your seat is. You can get really close to your concert by sitting behind the stage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyB938
50,"Gorgeous building, flawless acoustics.","The building is absolutely gorgeous, Frank Gehry at his best. It is impossible to miss the silver nautical-themed edifice while driving South Grand Avenue in Bunker Hill. The Walt Disney Concert Hall is one of the buildings that comprise the Los Angeles Music Center.The concert hall acoustics, designed by Yasuhisa Toyota, are ""perfect"". Every seat in the hall is an excellent seat, but because of its perfect sound properties, if you are late, you will not be admitted into the hall, until an intermission. You may be seated outside in very comfortable leather sofas or chairs and watch the performance via monitors.The building has but one enormous painting entitled ""Water"" which is complimentary to its theme. If you look carefully at the building, you will find what seem impossible angles, a whale or two, a maze, and lots of [abstract] sails. Use your imagination and come armed with a good camera when touring the Hall, but not during a performance, please.This is Los Angeles, are you worried about parking? Don't be. The Hall has underground parking, and you have other possible options: a) a large parking lot on South Grand and West Second Street, b) the parking structure for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, and c) another large public parking on West 1st Street and Olive. All parking options listed are within a block of the Walt Disney Concert Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carmtea

50,Great facility,Obtained a Groupon for wine tasting and classical music concert and turned out it was all you can drink...hard to stay awake afterward. Incredible acoustics...highly recommend taking the tour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotts321
50,"An iconic, wonderful place","Like many buildings that are now renown, Gehry's concept was reviled by many. Personally, I love it, particularly the interior. For many years, my wife and I have had a series to attend classical concerts on various Saturdays, so I have many things to say, and I will try to sequence them as we would experience upon a concert night.Parking under the hall is easy, and reasonably (for a major downtown) inexpensive. We arrive early, to attend the preconcert lecture and ALWAYS park the car facing out (we back in) because this makes leaving much much easier.Escalators take you from the lot into the hall (we take the stairs, my wife's vertigo precludes escalators), where we attend the preconcert lectures.The lectures are given by music professors from USC, UCLA, and the Cal State music programs and are a wonderful education about the music, the composers and the the artists. Often the conductor or composer is on hand for comments. We have learned so much about music and composers from these lectures. Knowing what to listen for and subtleties of the the composition add immensely to the experience. The area where we sit for the lectures is a joy to observe, with its curving wooden walls and soaring heights.To our seats.....the ushers are numerous and helpful. Restrooms are clean and accessible, and let's face it, make it easier to sit through over 2 hours of music. We have seats in the middle section and the stairs can be quite steep. Ladies in heels must very careful, and elderly or infirm individuals should give themselves lots of time.The music.....I could go on for hours....The conductors we have seen; Dudamil, Thomas, Esa-Peka and fabulous guests are living legends and rightfully so. Violinist such as Gil Shahan....incredible pianists. Also, we have friends who are orchestra members, and we love watching them play. The programs are packed with the great classical composers, as well as journeys into modernism. Personally, I am not a fan of the Russian composers, but being exposed to new music, I often find new favorites such as Glass and Salonen. The orchestra is truly world class. They play with energy, and force and enthusiasm. The tone and expertise they display has spoiled us for life. The conductors and guests are drawn from Europe, America and South America.The hall itself is marvelous. I find the forms of the ceiling to evoke images of cloud shapes. The organ pipes are a frozen explosion of power. The acoustics....well, I'm not an expert, but they seem truly great to me.We have also attended non-classical events. My favorites include organ recitals, as well as an intimate 3 person show put on by the wonderful singer/songwriter Vince Gil.At the end of the concert, it is not difficult or lengthy to drive out of the parking lot onto the nearby freeway onramps.In summary, I would say that the Disney Concert Hall is a world class treasure and a high water mark for the city fathers/mothers of Los Angeles. Somehow through all the controversies, committees and compromises, a truly great and iconic venue has been created. I hope it endures like a European Cathedral, for many generations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrKeithEvan
50,An incredible space,"Even if you're not there for the musical performance, the Disney is an experience to see... and they do have tours. The architecture is unique and stunning.

50,Music to my ears and eyes,"Stunning building, both indoors and outdoors. We have seats behind the orchestra, which allows one to watch the conductor. I like this as it reminds me of my high school band days. The acoustics are excellent. There is usually a pre-program that is always enjoyable. The leg room is tight and some of the steps can be steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KAS57

40,"If you have short legs, have fun","Acoustics are great, but how to sit in the side sections without being miserable? For us elders, I have fear of descending a steep stairway with a long drop and no railing to hold. Knee space is sparse unless you pay for ground floor position. Stopped all attendance for this reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaullMD

That's the only way to get into the actual concert hall. We were way up in the balcony and the acoustics were perfect. When all the nearly-100 musicians were playing, the sound enveloped you, yet you could hear individual instruments. When one musician was playing softly, you could hear her take a breath. A fantastic experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiamiMitch

50,Absolutely worthwhile,I simply walked the grounds and the lobby and I was thrilled with the architecture and photo opportunities. Found the Delft fountain described by another reviewer (in the surrounding grounds in back) and was equally charmed. The gift store was a nice browse too. Highly recommend to anyone remotely interested in architecture or art on a grand scale--the building is a sculpture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umbeijo
40,"Great architecture, poor signage, hidden treats","This building is the newest cultural attraction in downtown Los Angeles and serves as the home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and other music events. The building, designed by Frank Gehry, is spectacular to view and makes an iconic statement in the heart of LA. Whether you go to a concert here or not, be sure to walk around on the outside of the building, up and down the many stairways to see the lovely spaces and fabulous views of LA. It is a bit of a hike but good exercise as well as rewarding on the eyes. The gardens contain a lot of examples of the Naked Coral tree. If you go inside the building you will find a disappointment. The structure inside doesn't give you much sense of where you should go or what is going on inside, and this is made worse by the completely inadequate signage. (For example, tickets say to enter through a door on the 3rd level but the signs all say Garden Level. And some of the upholstery and tables look like they had to save money on them in order to pay for the grandeur of the outside of the building. However, once you're in the main hall, you are returned to a magnificent structure with wonderful acoustics, at least for the piano recital I heard. My only complaint inside is what looks like a bit of a junk pile of large red sticks which serve to hide the pipes from the pipe organ. I prefer to see the pipes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelF411

No. Why on earth not.If an attractive facility cost too much to built the best response it to have music in the building morning noon and night.Each time i visited I met photographers from around the world who were trying to capture this uncaptyrable building.P.S. the sky walk is lovely.

The orchestra pit and the choir seating take up half the space.They space really tends to go upward versus outward. Great for the acoustics and makes for a much more intimate concert experience. This building is a must visit spot. Go see the LA Philharmonic or any guest show.Tip- The cafe a few doors down off the Music Center is a better food bet than the Patina offered right below.

50,Beautiful venue,Attended a concert (Idina Menzel) there on New Year's Eve. The place has great acoustics and an intimate feel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeLikesThis
50,What a venue!,The sound here is as wonderful as we'd heard it would be. What surprised us is that it feels much more intimate than we expected. It is a superb venue for musical offerings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LabMAK
50,Love it!,"Besides the fantastic artchitecture of the Hall, the show, the seats, the view, the sound, the price of the tickets, everything was perfect! The show was crowded but it was no problem getting in and out. Security was manageable and we were promptly guided to our floor and seats. We truly enjoyed our seats on the side and up higher, with an un-blocked view of the stage and the performers. It was an excellent evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraw6682
40,What a building,"If you find yourself in LA on a wet day, (or any other day come to that) this is an excellent free attraction. Designed by the same architect that built the Guggenheim in Barcelona, it is a fine example of what modern architecture should be, bright, bold, innovative, but above all functional and beautiful. As I said it is free to enter and have a look around, and at the reception desk at street level they will lend you an electronic tour guide with which you can (self guide|) your way around at your own pace. There is an outdoor garden on the roof, and, if it raining, they will even lend you an umbrella!. Be prepared to leave some form of ID at the desk when picking up your guide, and enjoy. There is a good cafeteria style restaurant, but with fairly restriced opening hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philntrish
50,Great architecture,"World class architecture. If you like to walk, take the stairs that lead to the roof, for great views of the downtown and of the building's exterior and through sky lights the interior. Also walk the garden in the back and visit the ribbon of gardens that flow between the buildings across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Guide827681
40,Stunning,"We spent over 2 hours just walking around the outside and taking photos. We arrived too late to do an inside tour so that's on the bucket list for next time. We also went back late at night and snapped off some cool night-lit photos so if you're taking the train home, it's worth the short walk up the hill as a detour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mad_ELK
50,Wonderful excellent,This concert hall is definitely worth a visit. Even if your just there to see the hall the inside and outside are equally fascinating. Take a tour to learn all about the hall and it construction and then stay for a concert. Maybe you can get a seat behind the orchestra. It's pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geogh3
50,Amazing venue,"To see Idina Menzel sing on New Year's Eve we would have stood in long lines in the cold, fought for parking and suffered on hard seats - but we didn't have to! Going to the Disney Concert Hall was smooth as Idina's voice. Parking - underground parking in a warm underground carpark was a breeze, exploring the wonderful venue and admiring the amazing Frank Ghery architecture was wonderful. You could wait in the buzz of the crowd or find a quiet corner to sit down. The hall hugs you with its gentle curves and excites you with new surprises with every twist and turn.It was easy to find our seats. Comfy and every seat has a great view. The acoustics are perfect. The main hall is spectacular. Before the performer arrives you are already entertained by the quirky beauty. A funky organ with floor to ceiling pipes in unusual shapes is a center piece. Look up and down and all around - wonderful.And...Idina Menzel was super! What a warm wonderful and generous performer she is.Leaving the carpark was a dream - no nightmares here. Everything is easy and beautiful. Just what you want for a lovely night out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l1nda1
50,Take the Tour,Beautiful venue; it's an interesting tour of a world-class music space and architectural wonder. We did the self-guided tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veggiejan
50,Not that fond of Frank,"The hall itself has excellent acoustics and sight lines. The Orchestra view seating is different and fun (you seat facing out to the audience, behind the orchestra). Patina Cafe is pricey, but very good. A wonderful, modern ambiance. (I don't care for the exterior design.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeniceLE
50,One of the top concert halls in the U.S.,"This is a wonderful venue for great music. I have attended concerts of the Philharmonic, the magnificent organ, jazz, and Great American Songbook.Sound is wonderful, although they have had some difficulty adjusting amplified sound. It's at it best acoustic. I had chills hearing Barbara Cook sing Lennon's ""Imagine"" without mike for an encore.Seating and sight lines are excellent. A truly wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JacquesC378
50,Like no other sound experience,"In years past I had season tickets to Disney Hall, seated in the center of the top balcony section. What amazing sound, with a full view of the hall. Recently I booked a seat behind the orchestra, just to see what that was like. Same amazing sound, and it was interesting to see the performers from that perspective. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.My only caveat is that the sound is so delicate, so nuanced, that the one time we saw a rock band perform here it was awful - It was just too many purposely-amplified sounds bouncing off the acoustic surfaces. Otherwise, this place makes my heart sing, it's truly fabulous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyloans
30,UNIQUE VENUE BUT SOUND QUALITY IS DISAPPOINTING,"My wife and I have heard so much about the Disney Concert Hall and all of the millions of dollars and years of effort that went into the creation of this location. The building is very unique and the interior is unlike any other venue I have seen. Based upon the many reviews we had read/heard, we expected much more. The music sound quality was pretty good overall however, you cannot make out voices/singing at this location. The voices of singers (whether singly or in a group) are simply washed out by the music and when there is no music the voices are blurred and unintelligible. We were very disappointed by the overall sound quality at the location and we do not understand what all of the raving about the hall's design was about. The seating in the higher up seats is also cramped with little to no leg room and they are set at a steep angle so anyone with verigo would not do well in the higher up seats at all. We have been to older and less sophisticated locales that have presented a much better experience overall. If you go to this venue, do not waste your money on the high priced seats as it will not give you any better bang for your buck. The acoustics at this location are not any better than anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevencH4861VJ
50,Genius Design,"To be in a hall created by a genius architect is indescribable. To listen and learn the reasons behind the design of every nooks and crannies of this great hall is just overwhelming. I like the tour because it was very detailed, If you like architecture and design, this is definitely a place for you. Although parking is quite expensive, its worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penoytraveller
50,fantastic venue,"we saw the Chanticleer Christmas concert, great venue with a great pipe organ, acoustics are wonderful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DVE11044
50,Might be the best acoustic.,"We have been to Walt Disney Concert Hall on several occasions. Last one being earlier this year for Dee Dee Bridgewater and Al Jarreau show. There is not a bad seat in the venue, no matter where your seats are, you are a part of the concert. Acoustics are unbelievable whether you are up for jazz, classical or world music (we regret missing Paco de Lucia concert). So, pick whatever suits your musical taste, go and enjoy. The venue is wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kruzers19
50,Get Smart,Right in downtown LA lies these jewel of architecture. Niemayer like curves designed by Frank Gehry made this one of the most beatifull buildings in the world. A must see if you come to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacationeer999
40,Take the self-guided walking tour,"We had intended to just have a quick look at the Centre but were told the audio-guide tour was self-paced and free. We had to leave our passports at the desk which made me a bit uncomfortable, but there was no problem. Throughout the centre there are staff (or perhaps they are volunteers) to answer questions and ensure you don't get lost. There are also plenty of places to sit down when you need a break and plenty of restrooms.The tour was very interesting, with a good mix of facts and figures, and occasional sound bites from the architects, the Disney family, etc. The tour doesn't include the actual concert hall but you can see all the remainder of the facility.For me, the most amazing thing was the large ""rose"" sculpture in the garden area. The rose is a huge mosaic made from delft pottery and it is, well, just amazing. If you are interested in mosaics, and in pique-assiette in particular, it is a must-see.The tour took well over an hour, but you could do it more quickly it you wanted. We found the information on the art works, even on how the building is cleaned, very interesting.There is a cafe and a gift shop with some unusual gift items, as well as the usual post cards, art books, etc. Needless to say, I bought postcards of the rose mosaic.Next time we are in Los Angeles I would definitely try and book to see a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binduAustralia
50,Worth it,Quick stop. Great for photos. From here we walked to the Cathedral of our Lady of Angles and the LA City Hall. It was nice to see something other than big houses :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahH111
50,Beautiful in so many ways.,"World class musical hall. The acoustics and seating design in the concert hall are spectacular. Modern and accessible, the curved wood panels in ceiling and tiers combine to create a chamber that allows the music to soar or whisper. (okay, I personally do not like the fabric choices but, oh well) LA is fortunate to be home to fantastic musicians and the Phil just keeps getting better and better. Their ambitious programming offers something for everyone. If you are in town and enjoy music, buy a ticket and you won't regret it. It is accessible to the Metro from the Civic Center station or easy paid parking just across the street. But you don't need a ticket to appreciate the architecture. The public garden is open year round and is secluded offering a small urban oasis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanneKH
50,Best Acoustics of Any Concert Hall in the World,"I wonder if the L.A. Symphony realizes how fortunate they are to have a one-of-a-kind venue to perform in. Even if you don't go for a concert, take the tour. There's a moderate fee, but it's well worth it. You'll learn a lot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaltK255
50,Iconic and excellent,"Great venue: wonderful architecture, great acoustics, love the garden with flowering trees covering all seasons. Sensational organ - amazing with its wooden and wood-sheathed pipes - very organic looking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJinCA
50,Stunning Architecture,"A great place to visit. Viewing the place from the different angles and climbing the stairs ""inside"" the architecture give you a new appreciation for what architecture can be. Highly recommend visiting it. I didn't attend a concert which is also supposed to be amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mathyew
40,A great concert hall,This place has one of the best acoustics I have heard. The design inside and outside is also very unusual and well worth a visit.Went to see the LA Philharmonia play Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony. There were excellent. Went on a dress down Friday so had the conductor and music director provide a question and answer session at the end. It was very interesting and educational.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UKJohn88
50,Spain like you have never known before,Went to the casual Friday performance on Friday the 17th of November. The performance and sound quality was brilliant. This is a breathtaking beautiful building and it is a pity that a fascist usher stopped us from taking a picture of the empty stage. I can understand refusing to allow photos of the performers and using flash photography but we were three tourists visiting from Australia and just wanted a photograph of the stage.That aside it was really easy to park and enter the building before the concert and extremely easy to exit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twotravellers79
50,Stunning,"Much like its counterpart in Bilbao, Spain. This is a modern masterpiece. The sound quality equals La Scala in Milan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Esopstables
30,Take a look if you are in the area,"I was staying in the area as my husband was at a conference and I just had a wander around the exterior on a very hot day. There was a lovely quiet area to the rear of the hall with tables and chairs, shady trees, and an impressive mosaic water feature. I was more than happy sitting here contemplating life. There are some nice aspects of this area - although I wouldn't make a special trip if I was staying in another part of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbeforeyoucant
40,Beautiful sights and sounds,The first thing is the crazy architecture and design of the building. You could spend the day just walking around it let alone through it gaping in awe. Plus the music. So many different concerts go up there it'd be a shame not to check one out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
50,"A must-visit, outside and in","The building's appearance is still a jaw-dropper, although I've seen it many times. Inside the space is broken up but generally cosy. The concert hall has to be experienced. The sight-lines are superb anywhere, as is the sound. The 'talent' is world-class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KayT917
50,In a class of its own,This is unquestionably the best (and most dramatic) concert hall in the country. The accoustics are unbelieveable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HenryLosAngeles
50,Amazing Space,"We attended a chamber music concert here. The musicians were top notch and the concert hall itself is a work of art, both inside and out. A little tricky to get to, but worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizajane47
50,Great venue!,"I love coming to Disney Hall. I especially enjoy the Tribute to Vienna but any concert there is amazing. Great architecture, great acoustics, great shows. A must see in LA. Close to great restaurants as well :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimmiep2000
40,beautiful venue,Great concert experience by a very good orchestra. Concert hall was beautiful with excellent acoustics. Could have more reasonably priced food options in the vicinity. Had some problems getting a cab after the performance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elanor03
50,"Spent a New years Eve seeing, Pink Martini.","A great place to see a show. The sound was amazingly crisp, the architecture is something to behold and the staff were very friendly. A must to visit on you next outing to downtown LA. Lots of great restaurants close by and other downtown attractions too. The Metro-link stops close by as well to save on gas...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyM164
50,only from outside,visiting it from inside is embarrassing as it's on fixed hours and round tours who last a bit long.... but just from the outside it is breath taking... you can spend some time to walk around it... besides the Bilbao Guggenheim it might be one of the most amazing cultural buildings of recent history... not to be missed on any LA tour....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClocloLuxembourg
50,Dudamel can have any woman in LA - from 18-88,"More thrilling than any conductor I've ever seen, live or not, with the exception of Leonard Bernstein. Dudame's LA Phill is an experience not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aliqua
50,Concert Hall and Gardens,"WOnderful venue, and the gardens are spectacular! Now being maintained by the landscape architect who designed them, Melinda Taylor, they are impeccable! Certainly take a tour , or stroll through the gardens, they are open to the public!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanievl
40,Great music venue,"Not only is it a beautiful building it has one of the best conductors! Go and see Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, quite beautiful to your ears.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5estrelasTT
50,If you have any interest in architecture don't miss it,This is a world class architectural masterpiece. You can do the tour in about 1 hour. The food in the coffee shop was great (for a coffee shop). We walked the building and ate a bite then walked it again. The gift shop was open and had some interesting stuff for the thinking person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/workTraveler54
50,Beautiful concert Hall,Great concert hall with excellent seating and excellent acoustics. In a good area to walk and enjoy downtown LA. Near the music center and the Cathedral of the Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
40,Amazing architecture,The concert hall offers free selfguided audio tours. It guides you through different floors of the concert hall (not the auditorium) and into the garden. John Lithgow is the narrator of the audio tour and does a good job. The concert hall is quite spectacular and is definitely worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kengedahl
40,Most beautiful and most uncomfortable,We have a Casual Friday series so we attend at least 4 times a year. The concert hall is incredibly beautiful and the sound is exceptional. The LA Philharmonic is world class and never disappoints. But why did they pack in coach class seating to this wonderful venue? Our seats for the first year were on the side with a great view of the musicians. The seats are so close together and so uncomfortable that I refused to renew our subscription unless they moved us. We have been in the orchestra section the last few years. The seats are still uncomfortable but have slightly more leg room. I am not a tall or large person. We love Dudamel and the LA Phil so we put up with it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler445
50,"Fine music, beautiful venue",Four of us went to a concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic directed by Gustavo Dudamel.Dudamel is a young (31 ) Venezuelan who came up through the Venezuelan children's music program and conducted la orquestra infantil de Venezuela prior to coming to L. A. His dynamic style is worth the price of the ticket. What a treat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NPNan
50,........another frank gehry masterpiece........,...........take an afternoon tour.....bring fun money for the gift shop and then cross the street and see a great exhibit at MOCA!!!!!!!!!!!! then for two bucks ride the blue line to santa monica and eat at forrest gump's restaurant on the pier or find a great restaurant on the 3rd street promenade!!!!!!!!!then take the 3 bus transfer to the 6 for a late night 18 screen imax experience at the howard hughes center! .......the bus trip one way is $1.50!!!!!!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepriceCBSnews
50,Incredible Architecture and sound quality,Your eyes never stop moving as they explore the lines of this building insdie and out. The curving lines mean there are few part shapes of this building occurring more than twice. The sound in the concert hall is clear and lush from most any postion. We brought tickets behind the stage and could see the conductor. The second half of the concert we moved to the front of the stage and the sound didn't change. Most other concert halls sound dry in comparison to this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfarren
50,Gorgeous!,"The architecture is amazing! Beautiful venue! Diverse artists pass through here. I have seen Bobby McFerrin here, and I also saw the incredible Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic. Dudamel is a must see! Great place for out of towners to go. Gotta see downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2Connelly
40,BEAUTIFUL,Have to go just to see how beautiful the building is. Saw a few shows here and is also beautiful inside. Members have better and first choice seatings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allansavory
50,not a bad seat in the house!,The sound was sensational and the seating was excellent. Very intimate feel for a music hall venue. And the exterior is quite pleasing to the eye as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecarrie
50,love,always a joy. I am forever pleased when going to the Disney concert hall. I am reminded of the beauty of our city. I enjoy the downtown energy and feel lucky to have such a gorgeous place to listen to Dudamel and Bach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renej721
50,Building structure is very different!,Is just a building with a unique architecture. Not much to do unless you have an event. In front of this building there is a park with a nice fountain where you can relax and have a good time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diana0418
50,Fantastic Concert and Fantastic Concert Hall,"This is the new home of the LA Philharmonic, designed by Frank Geary, with a beautiful, acoustically wonderful auditorium. I heard one of my favorites, ""The Rite of Spring"" conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and I just have to say it topped any other performance of this wonderful piece I've ever heard, including one conducted by the composer (Stravinsky) himself! SUPERB!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whitsiepoo
50,Stunning,Striking architecture. Guided tours need to be pre-booked. Beautiful garden terrace with cafe hidden up top round the back! Would love to go to a concert there next time we are in town...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniep773
40,only saw it from the outside,what an amazing building! it was 92 deg fahr and sunny so with all that concrete and reflective metal the area was brutally hot. but what a neat building! we did not have a chance to go inside but did take a lot of pictures from various angles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boxsterbenz
40,Stunning building in the heart of Downtown,"I did a self guided audio tour of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Narrated by John Lithgow, with lots of input from architect Gehry, the project team, and the Disney family, it was a really interesting way to spend an hour. The building is absolutely beautiful outside, and there are areas you see on the tour, that you wouldn't know existed from the street, so do go and explore! I took lots of photos.It's a shame that there is no access to the auditorium, and I did think the interior would be a little more grand!But well worth a visit. I have to go and see a concert now, just to see the auditorium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison
50,Great space,"I've been here about 4 times, and I love this building for tours and for concerts. Even getting a last minute ticket in the last row of the concert hall was a good deal... it sounded great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kknew
50,wow!,"saw the l.a. phil with dudamel conducting the rite of spring. tix were easy to get on line, directions and parking very easy. the acoustics and sight lines were wonderful.. the hall is intimate, seats very comfortable and design striking. a great venue for music. would go back over and over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cara-in-italy
50,excellent!!!!!!,"Spent only one day there but was not enough. At each ''game'' there was a very big queue, so you lose a lot of time in waiting. Not only for kids, adults also should go there for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FOXYSP
50,A Great Hall,Unfortunately there were no concerts during our stay in LA so can't offer opinions on the venue from that point of view - but self guided tours of the building are free and well worth doing. There's no need to book - just turn up. We've seen Gehry's building in many cities but this seems to be his most successful. Can't wait to go back for a performence.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Feckenhamsters
50,great music,I will not speak about the building but about what happens inside the building. The acoustic is amazing. The concert hall is very tall but even in the last row each individual sound is clearly heard. I would recommend to try to get (well in advance) at least a ticket for one of the informal afternoon session. In practice: a lesson of music where the member of the LA orchestra explain the details of a specific piece of music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giulonragu
50,Architecture at its greatest,We were just blown over by the magnificence of the design of this building. Amazing doesn't seem superlative enough. Search the internet for info before visiting. We went inside to the concert hall which is beautiful but unfortunately we had plans and could not attend a concert. Had we done some research beforehand we would certainly planned a concert along with our visit to LA. In the summer there are free concerts in the Plaza amongst beautiful skyscrapers and the Museum of Modern Art. Very worthwhile to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumbleboo
50,Amazing architecture,The Walt Disney concert hall is a magnificent example of Frank Gehry designed architecture. The building is beautiful from all angles inside and out. We were not there for a concert but were able to peek into the concert hall while practice was in progress. The hall itself is amazing with staggered seating in the round so that every person had a perfect view and listening experience. We were not allowed to take pictures inside the hall but I have included many pictures of the other areas. A must see- next time I will purchase concert tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fitzga
50,"Fantastic Building, inside and out.","Feel free to explore the amazing building's exterior. I love the 'rose' fountain, made of chips of Dansk. The big concert Hall is even more impressive, but at this writing it is NOT on the guided tour, so you'll just have to buy a concert ticket to experience it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Regi184
50,LA Philharmonic,Saw the LA Philharmonic and it was phenomenal. The acoustics are unbelievable. One of my favorite places to go in downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmartin8
20,not worth it,I didn't like it there was a lot of constructions on the street we couldn't find a parking and there is no good spot to take a good photo for the building it didn't worth it at all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nnnnnnnn1919
40,Free Self-Guided Tour,"No one has mentioned that most days visitors can take a free self-guided tour. Leave a photo ID and pick up a “wand” (like a large mobile phone) and map. Walk around, punch in the number for your location (which the signs indicate) and hear the history of the WDCH, interviews with some of the principals, and interesting tidbits.The last wand goes out at 2:00 PM because they close at 3:00 PM.One of the interviews, with Walt Disney’s daughter, reveals that her mother’s vision was of a “brick church covered with ivy”; in other words, a warm, welcoming place. By that standard Gehry failed; the building looks like metallic sand dunes, unearthly and cold. Inside, however, the use of warm wood creates a homier atmosphere. I did not like that nearly every square foot of the place was covered with the names of individual and corporate donors; a monument to ego and vainglorious immortality.Because the auditorium was dark that day, I was able to step onto the fifth-floor balcony and look around. Down on the stage, two workmen were speaking in a normal tone, their backs to me. I heard them perfectly! What acoustics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raymundo02
50,"Go with your kids to the childrens concerts, they are terrific.","This is a wonderful building, especially if you are going for a concert. Some of the most fun experiences have been with my kids, first to the Pillow Theatre, and later to the The Toyota Symphonies for Youth. Both are very reasonably priced (although they do get booked up fast).If you goto The Symphonies for Youth, make sure you turn up at least 30-40 minutes before the concert. They have all sorts of fun activities all over the hall. I always like the instrument petting zoo in the roof garden, which I think is my favorite part of the building. There is also a rather amazing roof walk over the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fxsam
50,Gorgeous!,"The space is amazing, even if you just go to any event, being there and enjoying the space is worth it. We went for the LA Phil and had a wonderful night. Definitely look into nearby restaurants that provide a shuttle to and from so you can do dinner and a show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6to82008
50,"A Lovely Building, Excellent Design","This is such a stunning building and if your into clever and practical architecture, then this is a must see. Worth the effort and have a good walk about as there's some twists and turns in the design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmbassadorBas
50,"Amazing, Very InformativeTour","We caught the 90 minute, docent-led tour of the entire 4 theater complex including the gardens. It was breathtaking! Although we didn't get to see inside the Amanson because of a Mary Poppins rehearsal, we did see the set for Red inside the MarcTaper Forum, the Founder's Room (with magnificent chandeliers and artwork) and theater of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the beautiful Walt Disney Concert Hall. Outside it's stunning, inside it's light-filled and every detail works together. Our guide Kathryn was so well informed and really helped us see what an amazing undertaking (and the amazing people) it took to build the complex as we see it today. I thoroughly recommend this tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckg88
50,Well worth a visit,"You can wander around on your own, take a guided tour, or take a video-guided tour of this architecturally stunning concert hall. Don't miss the gardens, which are worth the visit alone. And it's free, with an interesting gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alcaldeellen

50,LA's outstanding landmark. A Must See!,"Everything about WDCH is stunning. LAPhil's could not be any better, thanks to late Lilian Disney for making it happen. Whether you go see a concert conducted by the fabuloso Gustavo Dudamel, or an independent concert produced by a local LA promoter, you're in this place for a treat. Patina Catering's food is delicious (an expensive) and the small cafe at the lobby offers great quality food at an affordable price. The architecture is brilliant, so is the staff. You can hold your private events at WDCH's BP Hall or the Founder's room if you will. I have produced a concert here back in 2008 and had a fantastic experience. Walt Disney Concert Hall brings another great angle to LA's cultural scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bitil

50,Do NOT miss!!!,"The architecture is outstanding and you really need to take the docent or recorded tour. We always take out of town guests here and they have all agreed. Problem is you really haven't seen the W.D. Concert Hall if you haven't seen a concert here, preferably with the LA Phil. Hard to get tickets, but you are not allowed in the concert hall unless you are there for a concert and it is worth every cent if you can get tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiDiMarinaDelRey_CA
50,Nice architecture and shows,The shows there are always great and the building itself is very nice. During summer it's even better because it's a full and interesting program during the whole season,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaudioBrazil71
50,Great architecture!! Go inside too.,"We really enjoyed taking pictures in front of this major L.A. landmark. Go inside too. We didn't have time to take the full guided tour but we just saw the concert hall. It was amazing. While you're there, you can go see City Hall too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolynD788
40,AMAZING Building,this building is a Gem a real architectural piece of Art. Not matter where you stand you get a great view of the building. Walk inside and admire the great workmanship. The acoustic is perfect. If you see Gustavo Dudamel tell him that he is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WittyK
50,I Toured the inside of the Disney Concert Hall,I walked over from my Biltmore Hotel in LA and took a self guided tour with headphones. The design of the building on the outside really catches your eye. So for an hour I walked through this beautiful building that was given to LA by Mrs. Walt Disney.........over 50 million dollars. The staff is on the ground floor to help you get started. Be sure to do a walk through at least.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike403
50,Totally worth a concert,"Took a ""guided"" tour before our concert and found this free, drop-in tour very interesting with a highly professional docent. The only thing that amazed me was she said ""if we told people they could come inside for free, they wouldn't buy tickets."" !!???! Yeah, buy a ticket. The concert hall is amazing. So is the music. You'll want both, I assure you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnsheepishlySeattle
50,Defintely worth doing,The self guided tour (narrated by John Lithgow) is free and very informative. The only down side is that the concert hall (stage) itself isn't included on the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissCathy
50,PHOTO OPS EVERYWHERE,"inside amazing music, outside stunning- easy walk to Grand Park. Make sure you get up and around the outside to all the hidden balconies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkynSea4me
50,Highly recommended!,"I thoroughly enjoyed my recent visit to the Disney Concert Hall. It's an interesting place to visit - both inside and out. I took the (free) tour with a guide. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable and I learned a great deal about the history, architecture and current use of the Hall. The rooftop gardens are beautiful and are well worth spending some time exploring. I would love to come back one day to attend a performance here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oztripper_1
30,One of the few free things to do in Los Angeles...,"...is to get a tour of the Music Hall. The story of the halls funding, how the gardens were constructed and the architectural challenges and changes to this hall were quite interesting. The LA Phil went from having 3,000 seats to 2,000 seats to have this music hall and the hall has an echo factor of 2%. 15% is considered better than average. If you like architecture and thinking about music, this will be a very interesting trip. The music hall hosts free tours at 10 am and noon on Saturdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceM447
40,arrive before 2 p.m.,"The self guided tour gave me independence and let me avoid the large group of tourists. There was a lot of information and if you're not interested in a particular fact you can just move on. The tour was in and outdoors and not very strenuous. Nice bathrooms. I wished for more time in the hall itself, but they closed it up after the large tour went through and I was at the end of the day. Free entry with parking validation (park underneath just because it's easier than finding street parking).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynnes537
50,Gorgeous Hall,"Classy place with all the most amazing artists in the world. I love it. The acoustic is great, the design is very unique. LA needed this kind of quality performing center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veronica2001

40,Must take the tour,"Great for architecture buffs or music lovers! There is an audio guided tour which takes about an hour and gives you all kinds of interesting information about the building. Apparently if you're there on the right day, you may have the chance to sit in on a rehearsal of the LA Phil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker
50,GREAT EXPERIENCE,You can go just to see the architecture. You can go to check it out and eat from their very good ($$$$) cafeteria. Or you make it an amazing evening with dinner at Patina and a concert with Dudamel.Walking outside on their roof top area at all hours is a fun thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
50,Rooftop garden is not to be missed,"This is a must-see on any trip to Downtown LA, even if you don't care for classical music. Go upstairs to see the architecture alongside amazing, native-style gardens and quite places to sit and absorb the beautify of the building. Great place to let kids let off steam, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SantaBarbarian
40,La Boheme,Went to WDCH for the Opera. Sat at the Lodge Level. View was good even for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FelipeP753
40,lots of points of interest,"we managed to get on a guided tour which filled you in on the finer points of the history of the building and some of the features which we would not have known if we just wandered around. the tour guide tended to talk alot about not much but you can wander away and enjoy the building catching up as the group moves on. the concert hall was open to the public when we visited which was a bit of luck apparently. if your into buidling with crazy lines, the arts or just like wandering around expensive projects it is worth a visit if you're in downtown LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelooks
40,Beautiful architecture and awesome acoustic in the hall,"Get a guided tour if you can - it is free and you can definitely learn alot more about the place. I went on a self guided tour, the place was beautiful, has state of art acoustic systems, will definite come back for a concert. The hall is amazing and the organist was playing when I was there - you will be touched by the acoustics in the hall!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RLim
30,Definitely a landmark but...,"It's a must-see if you're anywhere near Downtown LA, and interesting. But being a civil engineer, knowing one of the design engineers, and having an office overlooking its construction, I saw the cost overruns and the architectural errors that the supposed genius Gehry made, and I just can't like it much. So much wasted money that could have been more productively used elsewhere. The building's aesthetics are very interesting and unique, but an ugly monstrosity that looks like a pile of random metal junk (in my very subjective opinion).Concerts are great there, but for such a new bldg the acoustics could stil be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeMc666
50,Unusual building facade - Put together marvelously,"Uncommon outer facade. If you have time go inside the concert hall and the garden with a lotus shaped waterfall. Admission is free, parking is NOT free but you can get a validation ticket in the lobby which will give you a discount of around $5 if i recall correctly. Typically you can see this attraction in approximately 1hr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasVick

50,fantastic architecture!,The WDCH is a masterpiece of Frank Gehry architecture. You don't have to be a connoisseur of music or building structures to enjoy the free docent-led tours that are offered. In my view it's a must for a sightseeing day out in Downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trudyscrumptious_12
50,Free tour,Free tour to view the outside and also inside. Cool architecture and fun for young kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonN894
50,Definitely Take the Tour,We stopped on a Sunday morning and took a guided one-hour tour (there was a rehearsal going on so no self-guided tours). We really enjoyed hearing about the process to build and details of the theater- and that's two 14 year olds who liked it as much as I.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857JenniferM
50,"Gorgeous building, gorgeous acoustics","This is a gem. The building is so beautiful, and the acoustics are superb. The home of the LA. Phil, there are lots of fantastic concerts; chose any and you won't be disappointed. Have sat behind the orchestera, in the terraces on the sides, in the balcony; acoustics are brilliant and sparkly no matter where you sit. The seats aren't great in the terraces; there is very little leg room, but all that means is that if someone wants to get in, they can't climb over you; you have to stand up. Not a problem. A wonderful concert hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461carolb
30,Nice But Take The Tour,"We visited the concert hall and it was nice; but, we did not take the guided or audio tour. I wish we had because the self guided tour is kind of lack luster. Be sure to go out on the balcony as it is very pretty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ltlmsmfft
50,Cool! Awesome architecture!,"We loved this building, and took the audio tour inside and out. It also led to a garden on the 3rd floor, and onto a balcony, which showed you some of the surrounding buildings and the infrastructure behind all the metal panels which make up the exterior. The inside was very tasteful and the garden had many samples of plants, often labeled for info. Loved the shady garden, and the sculpture dedicated to Lillian Disney. Good views of nearby city streets below the garden, too.One disappointment was that we were told that we'd be able to see the main concert hall, but that was retracted later on, since they then had someone practicing inside. It would've been nice for them to tell us to hurry and go in before it would be unavailable. We don't make it to the L.A. area very often. In case you don't remember, this building was used on the ""Get Smart"" movie, and we actually brought that along with us on our trip, and watched it again after seeing the concert hall: Lots of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bakacha
50,Don't miss the self-guided tour,"Well worth spending a hour or so on the free, self-guided audio tour. This is a remarkable building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlebunch
50,Amazing Piece of Architecture!,I have to admit that when I first saw this buildings exterior I was in awe. What an amazing piece of architecture designed by Frank Gehry. Just passing by this structure outside makes me applaud the modern design combined with the playfulness of the composition the wave like forms of the walls does. I had not been inside yet but I can say that this place should be included in everyone's MUST SEE's!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieConti

40,Music to my ears!,"I was so excited that there was a audio tour. I loved that I could walk around at my leisure while learning about each part of the building from why and how it was designed. It defiantly stands out from all the other buildings in the downtown LA area and so it should. I loved the roof top garden the best, you really forget how high you are up. I would recommend this to anyone interested in architect and music in general.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiemarshall21

If you haven't been to a concert there, you have missed everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/90042
50,Not to Miss!,"It's utterly magnificent! The audio tour was so informative of the fascinating history of the design and making of this phenomenal structure. The garden out back with the ""rose petal"" pool decorated in the finest Delft tile was exquisitely gorgeous! The gardens are designed that something will be blooming year round.

50,The building is a work of art,"If you are in downtown Los Angeles then definitely take the time to check out this beautiful Gehry building. It is a favorite of television commercials.

50,An Absolute Must-Go When in LA,"It's really worth a trip to this Gehry-designed classical music mecca, for the exterior as much as for the interior. The architecture is a vision in steel and you won't find a single straight line on the interior. Definitely for the classical music lover, although you can also find world music, jazz, and contemporary classical. A special treat: the magnificent organ.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuntressCA

50,Fascinating architecture,"We spent a rainy morning touring the concert hall. It's a fascinating place designed by Frank Gehry. While the outside stainless steel construction is probably the most eye-catching part of the design, the more subtle design of the interior is equally interesting. While we weren't able to go inside the main concert hall, the smaller recital hall is beautiful with the Douglas fir paneling and the curves of the wall. The self-guided audio tour of the building is well-thought out, and best of all, it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dswgr6

50,You have to get to a performance.,"This unique architectural landmark on Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles is a must see for visitors and residents alike. Its a dynamic Frank Gehry design for one of the world's best concert halls. The exterior of the building is one thing, but its the concert hall inside is a handsome, acoustically-near-perfect orchestral hall. Unfortunately the frequent tours only give you a narrow look at the beautiful concert hall, so try to book seats for an event. Even the cheapest seats will give you a good appreciation of the concert hall. The new conductor of the L.A. Philharmonic is animated and a joy to watch conducting the marvelous orchestra. There is parking underneath the concert hall, but there is a charge associated with it. Nonetheless get some tickets, park your car, and enjoy viewing one of the most unique great-architectural and handsomely-designed buildings that America has to offer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgeblomme

50,Magnificent building inside and out,"Frank Gehry's design for this concert hall is amazing and you can get a great view of it just form the outside. But the real way to appreciate it is to go inside - either on one of their tours or, better still, see a concert there. We saw the LA Phil there during our short visit from London and were very impressed with the interior too - a great view from pretty much everywhere in the auditorium and lovely use of wood in the decor. There also have a very posh (and expensive) restaurant, Patina, and a much more manageable cafeteria, which we tried pre-concert and was just the job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan8552

50,ARCHITECTURAL MASTERPIECE!,"We were thrilled to be able to see Frank Gehry's futuristic Walt Disney Concert Hall. Unfortunately, we missed the last tour due to traffic problems. So plan ahead so you can tour the concert hall. We had just come from Sydney, Australia and a tour of the Sydney Opera House. We felt that in a short period of time we had been fortunate to see two of the world's modern architecture wonders. The location of the Concert Hall is of course not as stunning as the Opera House but, in my opinion, the curves of the architecture are as breath-taking as the Opera House. Check the tour times and leave early to get there. Go down Wilshire to miss the freeway if traffic is bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAChuck

50,An architectural and engineering marvel,"I have never been to a performance at the Disney, nor have I even been into the main theatre, but I have taken the free self-guided tour of the building. It is breathtaking in size and scope. If you are interested in architecture, design and engineering you won't want to miss it. It also has great outdoor public spaces, accessible without entering the building, where you can sit and have an al fresco lunch or just take a load off tired tourist feet. A pretty good shop as well and a cafe, which I did not try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PogoJ

The acoustics are amazing and the inside is decorated with warm wood tones. The lighting is well done.Based on our concert experiences, we would recommend mid-section seats in the orchestra east or orchestra west sections - great view of most everything on stage, but not quite as pricey!Parking is in a multiple level structure across South Grand with the parking entrance off of South Olive. Note: they only accept cash and it is typically $10 per car for an evening concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLPlovesPE42

50,A big Wow,"We were fortunate enough to be there on a Saturday when there was a 12:00 PM guided tour and the hall and gardens were open for touring. We of course were awed by the interior and exterior of the concert hall although (being organists) we suspected that the acoustic was a bit dry at 1+secs reverb for optimum organ sound. Nevertheless, the interior appointments and comfortable seating and of course the architecture and the care that went into every detail are just overwhelming. We were somewhat ""underwhelmed"" with the lobby spaces although this is obviously what Gehry had in mind. The spaces could do with some wonderful artwork sympathetic and congruent with the ""Gehry concept"". The little pre-concert talk area on the main floor was delightful. Overall - a big ""wow"". Seeing three Gehry designs within a month was a ""once in a lifetime"" experience (Wiseman Museum, Mnpls, The Getty in L.A. and the Disney).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/koolbill

Designed by Frank Gehry, it's visually dramatic, acoustically perfect and located to be an integral part of downtown Los Angeles. It even provides a moderately-priced cafe for quick and well-prepared meals before or after concerts (in addition to the two pricey restaurants in other parts of the Los Angeles Music Center). If there is to be any criticism, it's the comfort of the high terrace west and terrace east seats. These are spectacularly sited way above stage left and stage right, but they are tight and in very long rows without dividing aisles. Everything else in the hall is just about perfect. Any concert in this hall is an exciting treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bibliodude

50,A Feast for the Senses,"Seeing the Disney Concert Hall from the outside is a visual feast for anyone who appreciates brilliant design and extraordinary architecture, but attending a Philharmonic concert inside the magnificent concert hall is an unforgettable experience. We had seats in the last of 4 rows in the balcony (the ""cheap"" seats) and they were perfect - and we even had adequate leg room. There is not an obstructed view in the house, the sound is clear and fills the hall, the curves of wood are everywhere and give the space an incredible warmth and beauty. The place is a masterpiece and an architectural wonder. One of the three pieces were heard featured the organ - and it would be hard to exaggerate the beauty that those pipes spread in the hall. If you can get to LA, make plans to attend a musical event at the Disney Hall - and if you can really afford the splurge, try to have dinner before the concert at Patina, the 5 star restaurant attached to it on S. Grand Ave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerlady28

As a result, we were able to see the conductor work his magic, and we felt surrounded by the choir, as we were in the first row at the bottom of the section. The venue is beautiful, and despite the seating capacity, it has a very intimate feel. Although we were in an unusual location, the acoustics were amazing, and I would return to this venue again in a second for any musical performance! PROS: great acoustics, quality refreshments available, super convenient parking below the theatre.

40,"Excellent acoustics, but no leg room","It's a great music hall with some terrific performances, but beware of the incredibly tight leg room especially in the cheap seats high up. Also, the viewing angles from high above are not really very good. If you can't get decent seats down below, closer to the stage, this may not be a good value. Special tip: for some performances you can get seats behind the stage, looking at the conductor over the orchestra. There are just a few rows of these seats. They are very good.

This year she said she wanted to see the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Their website offers information about tour dates and times.They offer several tour options, most of which are free. There are self-guided tours from 10-2 most days. Visitors are given maps of the complex and are welcome to explore at their own pace. Self-guided tourists also have the option of utilizing an audio device that narrates interesting facts about each portion of the complex.They also offer guided tours. These start at specific times, so be sure to check the calendar on their website.There is also a Symphonian tour, which is not free. But it sounds pretty awesome. You get to tour four theatres. includes architectural highlights and a historical overview of the Music Center. It takes visitors into all four Music Center venues, including The Ahmanson Theatre, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum and Walt Disney Concert Hall, asWe did the self-guided tour. It was awesome. The architecture and acoustics are amazing.Unfortunately, the gardens were closed that day for a private event. That was kind of a bummer, but I visited the next month with my parents and was able to see the beautiful gardens. I was struck by how such beautiful landscaping flowed seamlessly with the looming intensity of the stainless steel exterior of the building.Tours do not include the auditorium. Because there is almost always some sort of rehearsal happening there, it is impossible to open the auditorium to tourists.My mother-in-law had a great time. We all had a great time.ALSO, it is close to public transport. I highly suggest using Metro as parking prices are insane!! We took the Gold Line from Pasadena to Union Station, then we took the red line to the Civic Center station and walked to the hall. Its not that far, but there are a lot of stairs at the subway station!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uber_critical_diner

Downtown LA is home to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a titanium icon of the power of architecture, designed by Frank Gehry.The building has been donated to the city of LA by Walt Disney's widow. Because of her passion for 'Delfts blauw', a huge artwork made of smashed Dutch China has been erected as a homage to Mrs. Disney on one of the buildings terraces.Inside as well your eyes are challenged and your ears spoiled.

Very interesting, sometimes boring (but hey, something for everyone I guess) but a must to see all areas of the concert hall. The interior is also fascinatingly ""wow"" and the way different materials and room separation has been used is innovative!The gardens are my personal favorite though (yes it has gardens!!). An oasis of peace and quite in downtown is just extraordinary!You can't visit the concert hall itself as it is in constant use of rehearsal, but there is enough footage outside (including filming of the concert hall itself) to enjoy the concert hall as well.I took a bit more than an hour to visit and I had to hurry, so try to aim for 2 hours and maybe even take a (free) guided tour!Combine this with a visit to the Queen Mary in Long Beach for a nice sightseeing trip.

You can hear so much detail (e.g. the harp) and the bass is so rich (e.g. you can actually hear the string basses) and resonates even more with the huge amounts of wood in the hall. If you love good music, make sure you attend a concert at Disney Hall.

This was our first time to the Concert Hall. We were so impressed by the gardens, architecture, design and acoustics; it was even better after hearing the LA Phil and Dudamel Conducting Fellow David Afkham.The pre-concert talk is a must as the information truly enhances appreciation of the music.The best kept secret? Bench Seat tickets.These comfortable church-pew style rows are directly behind the orchestra. Due to my husband's vertigo we abandoned our seats and the usher directed us to Row A. (I didn't know that the interior was similar to a ski bowl and that we'd be sitting in what felt like taking off on a double black diamond run.) Watching the conductor from the view of the musicians was exhilarating.Prior to the pre-concert talk we meandered through the gardens and reveled at the architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhonda123itsme

At night, I didn't get a really good look at the outside architecture, but the concert hall itself looks almost as splendid as it sounds. Wonderful acoustics!Tip: be flexible about when you go and where you sit, and you might just luck out and get a ticket on pretty short notice as I did. If you know about it more in advance, book early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReisenistmeinHobby
50,Great architecture,"The concert hall is a great building in LA. The design by Frank Gehry is striking and on a sunny day (i.e. most days), the stainless steel outside reflects the light wonderfully. You can take a free self-guided tour of the building for free which is well worthwhile. In particular make sure to walk around the building not at street level but at the level of the small garden which gives great views of the building and the area around it. If you only see one thing in downtown LA, this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karabiber
50,Don't believe the one star reviews!,"The reviewers who called the Disney Concert Hall ""boring"" and denigrated the acoustics are just plain wrong. It is a gorgeous building -- worth seeing even if you don't go inside. And Walt Disney's widow was intimately involved in the design and creation of the building -- there's a garden and fountain dedicated to her on the uppermost level. I think the aforementioned reviewers would probably be happy on a ride at Disneyland, but if your tastes are broader or more sophisticated, please don't miss a visit to Disney Hall. And if you can score a ticket to a concert, all the better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astandstill
10,Boring. Don't waste your time.,"This is a free attraction but unless you have absolutely NOTHING to do don't bother. They give a 1 hour tour but since there are near constant rehearsal they don't let you see the inside of the concert hall itself except on a video screen (they warn you of this in advance). The tour shows you the lobby, some hallways and the outside. The building itself is ugly and the inside is decorated very strange. Walt and Lilian Disney would not have approved of the design. It is not Disney like or creative at all. Waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christyreznor02
10,"Save your money for the tour of the hall, instead of on a concert","Beautiful outside, terrible sound inside. Worst music level ever heard, the Hollywood Bowl has better acoustics than this! Tour of the hall is a must, an architectural gem, but not for concerts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lolali
50,Tours of Concert Hall,"When I was in Los Angeles this spring, I had some extra time one day and went to the Disney Concert Hall. It was time very well spent! Some days have guided tours and at other times there is a ""taped"" do it your self tour, which I took. I believe the price was $15. I have talked to people who have not taken the tour because you can not view the concert auditorium itself. Please do not let that deter you. The tour is well worth it. On the tape, much of the narration is by Frank Gerry, the arcitect who designed the building. You see many details of the interior and exterior, including the famous ""Disney Rose"" sculpture, composed of broken Delft china. Also, there is public parking in the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DCTraveller40
20,Stout Lady With Fancy Hat,"The architectural statement...exterior architectural statement...is dramatic, if by the time of it's opening, a little bit more of ""another"" Gehry. Still, it does please this eye. Views from the interior to the terraces, from the terraces to the city, are interesting and quite handsome .The interior public spaces are mundane at best, user un-friendly at worst...and there is a lot of the latter. The best public space views (excepting the auditorium itself) are in the staircase to the garages, and much of that has to do with the sole use of color in the paint scheme. The shop is a shop is a shop. The cafe is a cafe and the dining space is dormitorial. Flooring in the dining area is dull, ceiling low, lighting poor, service area inconveniently placed. Air conditioning blows the light pendants; bring the dramamine. The first floor toilets, male and female, are separated by many yards. The men's has one of the newest hand flush urinals: one...I repeat, one. The lighting here results in your shadow cast into the facility. If you are looking for visual guidance for accuracy, forget about it. Also the only brand new hand operated sink I have found in the city, one in which electronically operated water sources are the norm.The hallways are shaped by the demands of the building. Thus, you go form cavernous and impractical space to funnels. Signage is very poor. There is a need for a lot of help in finding the correct door to the auditorium, thus there are a lot of people working the halls and the doors, a kind of Disney Hall full employment act. Very nice workers, by the way. The carpeting is distinctively awful, worthy of a low end chain hotel. All of the walls are white; lots of wall. Some of the shapes resulting from the skin of the building, something unrelated, by and large, to the auditorium, are interesting abstractions if you like constructivism and/or Arp.The auditorium is stout, perhaps rotund. It is paneled completely in light wood and the chair fabric is undistinguished. The seating is ungenerous and the angle of the leg is uncomfortable. This was done by people who do airlines seating in tourist class, I am certain. Even standing, giving passage to a new arrival is tight. There is a bleacher behind the stage which makes me think of Fenway Park. I waited for the peanut vendor during the chamber concert but he never came.The acoustics of the hall are such that if a wrapper is removed fifty yards away you can hear it. For chamber music the experience is more like overhearing rather than hearing. I would expect the orchestral use makes great sense and the sound experience would be quite good, with dead spots unlikely. The most dramatic use of light is behind the top seats in the bleachers, where blue spots are pleasing. Lighting casts head shadows all around in the top row of the two top decks as seen from the normal rear of the hall.Ours was a first visit which we looked forward to. We had taken photos of the hall during construction and were excited by what it would add to the landscape. In the end I think of the hall as A Stout Lady With A Very Fancy Hat. I trust Mr. Gehry will get on to designing buildings from the inside out and retire his milliner's sign.This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of TripAdvisor, Inc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpmcestmoi
50,Incredible Sound and Seating,"I took a hard hat tour of the hall in early April while the seats were still being put in, and was very impressed by the atmosphere and intimacy of the hall. It is seating in the round and there really isn't a bad seat. There are no overhangs and there is ample view from each seat as they are quite steeply raked. Not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless2397
