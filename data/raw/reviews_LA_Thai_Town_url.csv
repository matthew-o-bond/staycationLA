50,The best Thai in Mid-Wilshire,Let me just start with the Rad Na. This may be one of the greatest soups that I have ever eaten in my life. I have now ordered it at least 7-8 times and it always comes out perfectly. It is a must try. I had a fried chicken dish on garlic rice and this is such an amazing indulgence. The place with the plain name is also the place with extraordinary Thai food!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Staffing_Man
30,experience a little of thai culture,One of the unique things in los angeles is the concentration of ethnic neighborhoods and thai town represents the thai community. The easiest access to here is one can use the metro red line and exit at hollywood/western then its a hundred yards down hollywood blvd to the restaurants and shops. The largest gathering here usually takes place during the songkram festival (thai new year) which takes place around mid april.My main reason for visiting here is I developed an addiction for taro chips which i can readily find here.On other ocasions when I was just interested in doing a long walk i've walked from thai town up to hollywood/ vine to catch another metro station to head home,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
30,Place for Thai food 24 hrs,"As the an LA ethnic community landmark, Thai Town has not much to offer other than shopping and eating for Thai things. The area is located along rundown Hollywood Blvd. with a few rundown motels scattered along the area. However, if you want to buy Thai things and eat authentic Thai food, this is the place to go. Some restaurants in the area open 24/7 and some with live music at night as well. Day time is a little more deserted but at night the place is lively and filled with car. It is a block walk south of Hollywood West Metro red line station. Recommend for food, not sightseeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
40,Real Thai food here,"For Thai people living in CA ... this place is a gem!!Real Thai food, The dessert, Thai cooking ingredient, and Thai Massage.Prices are acceptable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soloista-Soul
40,Just another of Los Angeles' ethnic surprises!,"Visited the Thai Town area with my Thai partner to look for an authentic Thai meal and found so many restaurant options that it was hard to decide. When we finally made our choice we did in fact enjoy an authentic Thai meal served by a lovely young lady who epitomized that famous Thai hospitality. We later searched out a shop that specializes in Thai sweets and since I'm a fan of traditional Thai desserts I was in sweet nirvana,the incredible variety of all manner of confections was amazing and the best part,the shop will ship your purchases home for you! There are also small food markets and other interesting shops so for anyone interested in Thai culture or its now so popular cuisine a trip to Thai Town is highly recommended!

40,Love it!,"Last time I was in Thai Town was over 20 years ago and that part of Hollywood Blvd wasn't so great. I'm glad to see they cleaned it up and turned it around. Being half Thai, I wanted to visit here but was nervous about taking my son since I only remembered how it used to be. So glad we went and he got to see Thai Town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingParent1
