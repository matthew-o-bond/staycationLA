20,Severely Understaffed,"This bowling alley has seen better years, although it is not that bad-- but, yes, some pin-setting equipment in lanes (mine) kept malfunctioning. However, my biggest gripe is that on a busy mid-day Sunday, they were severely understaffed. They sell food, but they are slow as molasses with the orders; their bar area seems to be ok, but it wasn't busy. I'm not sure that I would recommend this place for bowling.",ricsandimas
20,Old school dated bowling alley,"Bowled here with my daughter while on a pass through trip to Vegas. We paid by the hour but the lane kept breaking down. They moved us over a lane, with the same results. The bowling balls are beat and the bathrooms old and filthy. I wonâ€™t be back! Cheers!",Randy J B
