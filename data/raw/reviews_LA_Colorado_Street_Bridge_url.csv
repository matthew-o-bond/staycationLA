30,Nice landmark,"Unfortunately the beauty of this bridge is being diminished by the city adding fences for safety issues. Not really a destination but if you are driving through kind of a nice drive. Remember this was the only way to cross the arroyo back in the day. If you do go here, drive over to see the rose bowl and then drive south along S Arroyo Blvd. to view beautiful homes and the arroyo. You will see a couple of other bridges built in the 1920s. This route ends in South Pasadena on mission if you stay on Grand Ave. there you will find nice local restaurants.",KenPa24
40,Old school since 1913,This bridge is famous for all the wrong reasons - people jumping to their deaths. It's a beautiful landmark and it's now partially ruined because of the ugly anti-climbing fence running on both sides of the street.,Creeping_Death_LA

50,Stunning,"I believe this is the oldest bridge in this area & while it's not used as much, most people get a better view while traveling the newer freeways & seeing it across the way. It is truly a beautiful structure & one of the prettiest bridges I've ever seen. Viewed in lots of movies & also know to locals as suicide bridge.",takatrp

50,The Bridge From Big Bang,"All of The Big Bang Theory fans will recognize this iconic bridge - it has been featured several times in the show. It was fun to see it in real life both from the 210 and actually driving across it at night. If you're in the area, make the effort to experience traveling across it.",Alan T
30,Used to be nice till chain link fencing ruined the look,"Due to the amount of suicides on this bridge dating back to Great Depression, the city decided to put chain link fencing down both sides of the bridge to deter jumpers. It’s supposedly temporary but not only is it ugly, it’s a sad reminder of the issues of mental health facing our city.",tmboc
30,it Couldn't Last,"Alas, for years this was a place to take visitors for a stroll and the good views. The bridge itself had its own history, charm and nostalgia. Returning there today brought back some memories of those things but the recent security measures have diminished the spot. Smog has also taken its toll on the views. Still, it does have some importance in the history of the city though kids might find it all a bit of a bore.",Drumraine

20,Ruination of a Landmark,"The Colorado Street Bridge USED to be an iconic Pasadena landmark.

The bench areas are now totally blocked off by chain-link fences, an ugly reminder of the bridge's nickname, which I will NOT mention here.",ScottWhitfield
30,Maybe a Side View Would be Better,"OK, I know this bridge is ""historic"" but from both direction passage on a motorcycle, I found it to be just OK. I guess it could have been a 1 or 2, but 3 = average was all the excitement I could raise. Next.",Robert A
40,"Nice and attractive bridge with a sordid history, that is ongoing","This is an old bridge that has become famous for people jumping to their peril. They upped the security so that it is more difficult to do so, but people are still jumping, according to a neighborhood person I talked to recently. There is a new housing project development just under the bridge on the south side that makes it difficult to get a good view.",deathblosom

30,It depends upon how you feel about bridges,"The Colorado Street bridge is a very attractive curved bridge crossing over the Arroyo Seco. It was built in the early 20th century to make for an easier connection between the cities of Pasadena and Glendale. It has a dark history as the ""suicide bridge"" and in a recent renovation high iron fencing has been added. However, that has not been enough of a deterrent and now wire fences have been added around the lamp posts. I cross the bridge frequently because it is convenient, and in late summer a street festival is held on the bridge, which I have not attended. From my perspective, it's just there as a convenience!",Joseph H
40,Interesting to walk out on the bridge,You can park your car at Defender's Park in Pasadena (just north of the intersection of Green/Grand) and walk out onto the bridge. You get a good view of the arroyo below and of the Rose Bowl just to the north. It is a quick activity - no more than 30 minutes but is worth doing. You see much more than you see driving over the bridge. The experience has been a little degraded by all of the fencing put up to deter jumpers.,So_Cal_Illini_81
50,Hollywood icon in Pasadena,Hollywood icon in Pasadena. The bridge has been a”stand in” for locations around the world. Many commercials and television shows have also been filmed there.

50,Always a treat to drive across it,"When one of our daughters was a child, she said she would love to have her wedding on this Bridge, as it reminded her of a wedding cake.We said goodbye to this lovely Bridge today.

50,It's a bridge...right?,"It's an iconic bridge that is featured in just about any film shot in Los Angeles.When my grandmother was young, it was called suicide bridge as there were no high railings and it is perched 150+ feet above the ""Arroyo Seco"" that splits Pasadena from the rest of the world. I'll let your imagination do the rest.It is worth the drive over just to say you've been there when you see it in a movie. Not to mention, it is rather beautiful!",Old Pro
30,"Surprised this is one of the ""attractions"" listed","I guess thanks to LOTS of Hollywood movies and the most recent one is the La-la land I guess, this gets listed as one of the attractions.

50,HISTORIC BRIDGE,"Construction of the bridge began April 15, 1912 and took 18 months to complete. The cost of the original bridge was $235K raised by the City of Pasadena and LA County.In 1913, the Colorado Street Bridge was an important visual landmark that helped link Pasadena with Los Angeles. It was the first high level crossing of the Arroyo Seco, and at that time the longest and highest arch bridge of its kind. It was 1,468 feet long and 150 feet high and represents one of the finest examples of concrete arch bridge construction of its era.Colorado Street Bridge (CSB) is one of the most spectacular scenic structures in the Southern CA community. It quickly became popular among strolling lovers and suicides that leaped into the Arroyo Seco so often that it was popularly tagged ""Suicide Bridge"".The CSB is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (1981), the Register of Civil Engineering Landmarks (1975), and as a Pasadena Cultural Heritage Landmark (1979).The CSB was closed on November 14, 1989 because of fears about its seismic safety. Rehabilitation and seismic retrofit of the bridge began in March of 1991 and was completed in November of 1993 at a total cost of $27.4 Million. The bridge reopened on December 13, 1993 exactly 80 years after its original dedication.The renovation is expected to extend the life of the bridge 50 to 75 years.",amaloyan

50,Absolutely love crossing this Bridge,"About ten years ago, our youngest daughter bought a house on the Eagle Rock side of this Bridge. We visit her many times during the year, and love to spend time in Pasadena, so crossing that Bridge is a must. On this visit, we are staying in Old Pasadena, as our guest room in her house, is now a nursery, so no more free room and board for us. We cross the Bridge twice a day, and it is always special.This very beautiful concrete arch Bridge was built in 1913 at a cost of less than $200,000. It is almost 1500 feet high. The Beaux Arts design, arches, light standards and railing are very distinctive. There is a narrow walkway/sidewalk, but we have seen very few people crossing the Bridge on foot. No pull outs along the way, so the only opportunity for photos is from your moving car, unless you drive down into the Arroyo Seco below, where the Rose Bowl stands.",NYU62
