50,L.A. History,"I’ve known about this place for a while and I don’t know why it took me so long to visit but I’m glad I finally made it. I loved it. We went on a Saturday for the 1 o’clock tour. Our group had about 10 people in it. The tour was about an hour twenty minutes. Only the first three houses are complete, the others need extensive renovation work on the inside (which is expensive and they are are a nonprofit so easily said than done) but are still cool to see. After the tour we were free to wander around and take pictures (not inside the homes). Lovely way to spend an afternoon. I would recommend pairing this with a visit to Lummis House just down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bookish_B
40,Another hidden gem in LA !!,"If you have any interest in architecture or victorian homes, this is a “must see” attraction. Outstanding paint job on the Hale home.Real surprise is the donated drug store at the end of the street.....Literally 1000’s of retail drugs, cosmetics, chemicals, used in the drug store of yore.A steal at $ 8.00 admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelroc12
50,Very cool,"The guided tour is very interesting, the houses are beautiful and the colonial drugstore was amazing. Also, I would recommend leave the rambunctious, energetic toddlers at home. Too many things to knock over and break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/euichki
50,Victorian Los Angeles History,"I’ve heard of this place before on the internet and thought it sounded really cool so I figured I’d check it out and it’s a fascinating bit of history! It’s a great collection of 19th Century Victorian architecture from around the area that was moved to this location as a means of historic preservation from urban development. People don’t usually associate LA with Victorian architecture compared to say San Francisco, so this place is here to remind us that the style does indeed exist here and has some really charming examples.The tour guide was very knowledgeable and provided a lot of details about the homes and the era in which they were built. I like how she didn’t hold back on some of the more controversial details of the past and just told things as they were in an objective way. I forgot her name but she was great and it was wonderful being able to see the interiors of these beautiful homes. We also saw a drug store exhibit at the end of the tour which contains actual, unopened drugs from the era that filled the whole room with a strong medicinal aroma.The best preserved buildings are towards the front of the entrance with the ones in rougher shape towards the back. Regardless of their condition though, the interiors of the four houses have a lot of peculiar details like a niche at the top of the Perry Mansion stairs to help transport coffins in and out of the house. I highly recommend people check this place out if they’re into learning more about Los Angeles history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Victorian Los Angeles,"A delightful 2-hour tour of a number of Victorian houses saved from the wrecking ball and moved to a spot just off the Pasadena Freeway. Apparently, a couple of the houses are haunted, particularly one that is octogonal in shape. Try to get on a tour with Dana Amann, who was particularly good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimP988
50,Tons of Victorian and Architectural History,"The tour is well worth it's price. There are many Victorian era homes, lots of antique furniture, a depo, and more. These homes are furnished with era appropriate furnishings and on one home, there is a surgery with all sorts of old medical equipment. It was truly interesting to go in and look at how they lived. One house in particular has a beautiful garden with heirloom vegetable patch and rose bushes. The Museum is doing a lot with these old homes, refurbishing them back to original conditions. This is a worthwhile trip to make, especially the octagonal home and the drug store. One could spend a lot of time viewing all the old medicines and things there. I hope to return again soon. It was fun and educational, and would make a nice outing with family, grandchildren, couples or solo. There are tables on the lawn for sitting outside and enjoying the peace and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMTESQ
50,Wonderful Victorian Houses & Tours,"I was recently at Heritage Square Museum for their annual Lamplight celebration and I was completely impressed. Volumes of volunteers dress in period costumes and help tour visitors through the Victorian homes as part of a mystery plotted adventure. Some play music from the era in the parlor. If you were part of this event, you also celebrated after your tour with snacks and sangria and an opportunity to shop with fun vendors that were present. You can also visit on weekends for tours. This place will transport you from urban Los Angeles to a small town feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,GREAT VICTORIAN HOMES FROM AROUND LOS ANGELES,"The only draw back of visiting Heritage Square Museum is the parking. The museum is located at the end of a very narrow residential street just off of the Pasadena freeway with very little parking, at the end of the street you double back on a dirt path and park as you can. We had a long walk back to the entrance of the museum.The museum consists of 5 housed, a train depot, carriage house, church and drug store all moved to the location from around Los Angeles and dated around 1900. The of the houses and the Drug store are fully furnished and look great inside and out. The church and two houses still need a lot of work before they are finished. This is really an amazing group of buildings to tour.We were there for an Annual Halloween & Mourning Tours event and it was showing the 1918 Spanish Influenza outbreak so we learned a lot about customs of that time regarding death, burials, medicines and the history. The tours were very good and interesting with ALL of the people doing a great job portraying their persona.If you are interested in turn of the century houses and buildings this is a must stop for a four hour tour Friday thru Sunday only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
30,Interesting Museum right off the freeway,"Not sure how large or what to expect, they were having a special for Halloween where they put on a Mourning Tour. First off parking is very difficult. You drive 500 yards along a very narrow one car only residential street then turn into a dirt parking lot. Large vehicles may have a difficult time. In speaking with other tourists, many found the museum difficult to find. We arrived before they opened which allowed for parking. There are 5 structures that have been preserved for touring. This particular weekend you could tour each house on your own, but from what I understood normally there are no self guided tours. The volunteers were in period dress. This weekend was about the Spanish flu that hit in 1918. There was the Perry Mansion where they recreated a Phantasmagoria. There was a re-enactment of a funeral procession from that time period. One structure is the Colonial Drug where on display was every medicine in the original box that was offered back then. The volunteers were all very knowledgeable and very much into the time period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,Great Collection Of Los Angeles Historical Buildings,This place was a little hard to find and even more difficult to get to. It is at the end of a long residential street with cars parked on both sides. There is only room for one car to go down the middle. It is fun when there is also someone coming from the other direction. But it is all worth the effort. If you like history and architecture this museum will show you a collection of very old houses and their history.When you arrive you will purchase your ticket and wait for the next guided tour. You can enter the site for free but you can not go into any of the buildings unless you are on a paid tour. The $10 is worth it. Two people in period costumes will guide you through each house and give you the history. Each house is fully furnished for the period. The two guides are very knowledgeable and will answer all of your questions.The building are great to see if you like history and architecture but the tour is really made amazing by the tour guides and their knowledge and enthusiasim. This place is a great site to see if you are in LA and like history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Interesting guided tour,"Due to the concern of misusing the photos of houses here, no photos are allowed inside the house. Knowledgeable volunteers gave interesting information about each house. The heritage park itself was not as good as the one in Calgary, but you can tell their efforts to maintain the history of the city. Pay a visit and make donations are the best support to the team.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monrabdog
20,Not what we expected - why here?,"Just putting this out there because I had not seen any comments about this, but what a weird place in L.A for the location of this museum. We thought we had taken a wrong turn. The museum is at the end of a dead-end street (Homer St). When we pulled off the highway, the first thing my wife noticed was someone spray-painting on the corner, what appeared to be a gang symbol (marking their territory). When we turned down Homer St, cars were parked on both sides of the road which made Homer so narrow that only one car could fit....and there was a car heading in our direction as we drove down Homer. So they had to reverse into a small space to let us pass. Parking is in a gravel lot next to the shoulder as you reach the end of the street.And then the kicker was...as far as we could tell there were only a few houses, and it was going to be a while before they started another tour. By this point my wife, whose idea this was, had lost interest. So to be transparent my rating has nothing to do with the homes - we didn't go in. But as an attraction, was this really the best place they could find for re-locating these homes for tours???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadJunkie
50,Beautiful Los Angeles History,"This a great way to learn about some Los Angeles' rich history and beautiful architecture. If you want to travel back in time, then visit Heritage Square and take their walking tour to do it. These homes are amazing from the outside and even better walking into some of their spectacular rooms filled with marvelous wooden works of art. Houses now a days aren't what they used to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AM90031
40,Very interesting collection of homes,"I've driven by this collection of antique homes many times, and vowed each time that I would find an opportunity to visit it. My Lady and I took advantage of a recent tour of local museums and historical displays to visit here. It's a collection of mostly Victorian-era homes that have been relocated to this assemblage, some of which have been restored to their original splendor, and most in their as-found condition. We enjoyed the dialogue provided by the docents who attended each of the homes, and had to snicker (at ourselves) at how much many of the homes replicated many of the features that we had lived with in our childhoods. Each of the homes had significant character, and had a story to tell. I was particularly intrigued by the Octagon House, which made a very good use of its floor plan to make a very livable home. In all, it was a very interesting and enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
40,Very Interesting,Our tour guide recommended we go here and it was not a mistake it was quite interesting and the building in itself is beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katemonroe195
50,great museum gem in a town with great tourist options,The heritage square museum is a great living history of LA. The buildings that they have and have restored are great to see and the guided docent tours are extrodinarily informative. A must for anyone that likes architecture or histroy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levicj
30,"A Small, Less than Superb Sample of Vintage Architecture","The ""museum"" is a collection of historical homes from a bygone era. If you are interested in vintage homes and architecture, you'll find this museum somewhat interesting. For the adult price of $10.00 (Seniors $8.00) you'll get a docent-led tour for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Natalie, our docent was excellent. In vintage dress, and with a delightful sense of humor, she was able to tell us about each home, its owners and answer any questions we asked.Unfortunately, restorations are not complete. We were not permitted in the upstairs portions of the homes and the octagon house was closed on the day we visited due to film shooting.Part of the tour included a visit to a drugstore, complete with an antique soda fountain and countless apothecary jars full of substances that were used in the formulating and compounding of prescriptions of bygone days. I found this place to be the most interesting in terms of looking through all the cases of the products that were sold at the time and found myself grateful to the individuals who were able to collect, retain and restore such an enormous collection of products. One could easily spend a couple of hours in the drugstore alone but that is not allowed. Individual touring is not allowed and all touring must be docent-led.The old adage ""You get what you pay for"" is appropriate with this museum. This advisor felt reasonably content with what I got for my $8.00 admission fee and can recommend this as a stop if you have a couple of hours to give and find yourself on the 110 Harbor Freeway around exit 27. Otherwise, continue on your way to Pasadena for an absolutely outstanding visit to the Huntington Library and gardens where one can never be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PAAbee
30,"Great architecture, but sadly not restored well.","These are beautiful buildings, and on/from the outside, they're historically accurate. However, take a tour and unfortunately you'll only see the first level of a few of the buildings, just to be told that much of what's in there is not historically relevant to the houses, and also you will see evidence of inappropriate renovations/modernization and irrelevant donated items that they don't seen to know what to do with.Some of the inappropriate renovations were apparently done after the houses were reassembled onsite, including the removal of the old kitchen in the first house in order to make room for mannequins displaying period dress. I really, really can't understand what the curator was thinking when they made the decision to do this.The tour, although interesting, was VERY long. In face, we left part way through as it became a bit repetitive and the kids got tired of having to answer questions instead of being told about the homes without having yo already know the answers. I think it was an attempt to get them thinking, which might be appropriate with school groups of younger children, but was a bit boring for teens.Although I clearly have issues with the management of the site, I do appreciate the importance of preserving such lovely homes and I'm so glad that they've been saved from demolition. However, the lack of genuine preservation and restoration is very disappointing, particularly when you're told on the tour that this has been done in part by the current caretakers.I would recommend visiting for an hour, taking photos and skipping the tour & you'll leave with a more positive view of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dromomaniac
40,Sunday outing,We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very enjoyable. We have been to a lot of historic homes before so I was a bit bummed that you couldn't go beyond the first floor and some of them were barely restored on the inside. I know it takes lots of time and money so I'm thankful for the work the preservation society has don't already. The drug store in the back was a nice addition. Lots to look at in there and it was only half the collection of the donor!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
40,A Victorial Village off the 110 - Who Knew?,"During a visit from my Parents, my mother found and picked this as a Saturday Activity. Tucked off the 110 the village houses about 10 different Victorian houses salvaged or replicas from actual Los Angeles neighborhoods. You can only tour the houses with a guide. Our guide, Dana, was dressed in period costume and very well informed of the buildings and their history. The exteriors of the houses are beautiful and well crafted from an era well gone. The interior were fun to see but did not have matching time period furniture. The tour lasts about 2 hours, visiting about 5-6 houses ending up in the ""new"" pharmacy/drug store at the end of the lot.If you are a die-hard Los Angeles History buff or an architect junkie - you will love this place. The have some great Holiday events planned. I have been living in LA for 12 years now, I had never heard of this place. I am glad I went - though I do not think I would have gone on my own. It may be a little boring for the younger kids and difficult for persons with walking disabilities. The buildings are not wheel chair friendly and you do have to walk up and own steps and on a gravel driveway.DO NOT GO if there is an expectation of RAIN. If the tour has already started and it starts to rain they will finish the full tour. However they will turn away visitors if it is raining. The cranky women at the front desk will not be nice about it. She won't even let you use the bathroom after they turn you away.The Fluffy Orange Tabby Cat that greets the visitors was extremely friendly and loved having its picture taken though will not sit for selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142lp
40,Halloween is a special time,"This place is only a few miles from home and I could see it from the freeway over the years. Today they had a Halloween event and I finally made it. There are about 8 structures and today there was a collection of old hearses. You can only visit the first floor of the houses. If you run out of things to do, it is kind of cute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Starviagera
40,A Group Of Victorian Era Homes From The LA area,This is a very pleasant place to visit just northeast of downtown LA off of the 110 Freeway. The collection of buildings is awesome and the docent led tour is well worth the investment of time to be able to see the interiors of some of these 19th century homes.The homes were moved to this site over time from other sections of LA like Bunker Hill and Boyle Heights. There is also an old pharmacy where the tour concludes and a church that can only be viewed from outside.The place where the tickets for the tour are sold is an old rail station from Palms that was used in a Laurel and Hardy movie.AS a resident of the area I have wanted to visit for some time and finally found a free Saturday afternoon to take the drive over. Very glad I did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bccrab
50,experiencing a bygone age,I would agree that the ride out to the museum is not great but it's well worth it. I was amazed at the houses and history. As a visitor from the Uk I am used to seeing much older houses bit these are so much a part of the history of Los Angeles it was a privilege to see them and the old railway station where Laurel and Hardy filmed one of their films. We would have liked to know that the tour takes about 2 hours and didn't leave enough time so only got to see the first 3 houses but that was great and we will re-visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caroline-Bennett
50,Authentic experience of a different time,"The homes are amazing, especially the Hale House. These homes were formerly in or adjacent to Bunker Hill, or environs like Pasadena, Lincoln Heights. Great photo ops too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickdaHammer
40,A pleasant distraction - 3.5,"Collection of Victorian houses in LA - one wouldn't expect to find. This is a fairly extensive tour, and our docent was certainly enthusiastic; that is, he had his note cards well prepared. On specific items placed about the houses; well.... One house for instance had much 1930's furnishings, accessories and implements, which seemed to come as a complete surprise. Even the architectural review was a bit spotty if one knows these things. The odd thing to this easterner was the reverence accorded to very common everyday objects. Flea market finds in some cases, and we who actually live and use homes that are 125 years old as residences (I owned one that was 1888) find it odd to worry about a stray child touching the staircase bannister! Still, it's a nice introduction and if encourages people to take up an interest in history then mission accomplished.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,A Gem,This place is a museum of wonderful old houses. It is a gem in a nasty neighborhood. The homes are well kept. You can travel back in time just by visiting this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickMcNally
50,A Treasure,"We found this attraction simply by going to the GPA and looking under Leisure and Attractions. I expected an old historic part of LA. We drove there and it was located in a so-so neighborhood. Initially we were going to leave. I didn't think my son would like it. However, I said to myself that I should see it now because we probably wouldn't return. It turned out to be great. It consists of several older house representing various time periods which have been moved to this small park. A tour guide took us through the houses and talked about the social aspects of life at the time the houses were built and also included artifacts such as an old icebox, etc. My son, who is interested in history, had to admit that he really enjoyed the tour. Our tour guide was named Rose and really made this a great experience. I fully recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanBachrach
50,Take a step back in time,"Allow about 2 hours for a wonderful docent tour of this Museum. You may recognize from several movies such as ""Saving Mr Banks"" and ""Legally Blond"". Period houses which are fascinating to explore. They also have a church and stable which you can only view from the outside. Old railway station where you buy tickets and has a gift shop. Best of all is a fully furnished Phamacy which a vast range of interesting items dating back to the last century. Easy acces off Highway 110. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventureExploreFun
50,Fascinating,"We saw Heritage Square Museum from the highway the year ago decided that with visited on an extra to Los Angeles. We were not disappointed.Heritage Square has about 12 Victorian houses, an old Methodist Church and a wonderful drugstore. Not all of the houses have been refurbished, but you do get the opportunity to see a couple of the houses via a guided tour. The museum is only open at weekends, but well worth the visit. There is ample parking. We did not find the admission charge $10 as being expensive.Perhaps the most fascinating part of the tour was the drugstore. It certainly brought to life some of the scenes that we only see at the movies. I had no idea the reason why drinks was sold in a drugstore until I visited this particular parlour. While you waited for your concoction to be made, why not sample soda hot drink. Simple really. The drugstore is full of personal collection of memorabilia of the pharmaceutical industry. It's one of those places where you say, oh I remember them!To the houses we used in the film ""Saving Mr Banks"".A wheelchair could disabled people be useful. It is a long walk from the entrance to the furthest exhibit, the drugstore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stelondon
50,Wonderful way to spend a Sunday,"I took my mother here on Mother's Day. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour of several different style homes, structures, and the pharmacy at HS. The tour is leisurely, so if you're in a rush come when you can stroll and absorb the architecture and knowledge of the volunteers who run this gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JewDontKnow
50,Wonderful events,"Heartwarming to think in this town where everyone is for sale that there are sill people trying to preserve and celebrate Los Angeles before she was nothing more than the seat of the entertainment industry. This is the place to go to remember once upon a time LA was home to someone glad to live there and live the simple life. Go for one of their events, better yet, dress up and really enter into the spirit of things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiacZ4570GI
30,Victorian Houses & Pharmacy Museum - Slightly Frustrating,"Heritage Square has several Victorian houses & a pharmacy museum that you can go through on a guided tour. People who are into architecture or antiques would probably enjoy this museum. I was a little frustrated since the pace of the tour is slow, the phone message and the web site were not accurate on the hours of operation, and the houses are not that much different than what you would find in the eastern United States. The tour group seemed to come alive at the end of the tour, when we went into the pharmacy exhibit since most young people were totally unfamiliar with what pharmacies used to be like (soda bar with stools).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ralph_MB
50,Hidden treasure,"It's sad that the average Angeleno doesn't know about this place. For mere $10 (or $20 for some events), you can go back in history living the Victorian era. The houses are well kept and they give tours very Sunday to teach you about the history of each house and it was moved from different locations around Pasadena/ la area. A must do when you are in la.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randajam
50,New Pharmacy Museum a real treat,"A significant new addition has come to the Heritage Square Museum -- the Colonial Drugstore museum, which houses the George Simmons collection. Just opened in early November 2012, the pharmacy is full of pharmacy artifacts and includes a soda fountain. Don't forget to go in the back of the shop and look into the prescription department!It is an excellent complement to the Victorian homes that make up the rest of Heritage Square.The treat of Heritage Square is interacting with the excellent docents in the midst of the old houses and buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadisonGrog
50,Victorian beauty,We took a tour of several victorian homes which were moved to this area for preservation of beauty and history. Very worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lopernc
50,Great museum for special events with the family,"Visited here for the ""Halloween Mourning Tours"", held every year the weekend before Halloween. For the adults, the tours of the homes focused on death in Victorian times (hence the title) and had actual docents weeping at a funeral, getting a reading done and celebrating the Dia de Los Muertos. Our kids were able to make crafts, go trick or treating between the homes and pick a pumpkin from a pumpkin patch. It was a great time and I'm glad we went. Of course, the docents also talked about the eight structures there, which have an interesting history all their own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justforreviews
30,Los Angeles architectural history,"Los Angeles Heritage Square is an indoor/outdoor museum adjacent to the Pasadena Freeway at Avenue 43. Here, the museum is relocating and slowly restoring historic houses and other buildings. The highlights are a couple of Victorian homes and the Palms train station which was used as the “Pottsville Station” in Laurel & Hardy’s 1929 short, ""Birth Marks."" For the $10 admission charge, Heritage Square might be disappointing to some; however, due to the low attendance, you would likely get a very personalized escorted tour. I recommend it, if you are interested in architecture or Los Angeles history. You can combine your visit here with a trip to the nearby Charles Lummis Home and the Southwest Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fromdelmar
