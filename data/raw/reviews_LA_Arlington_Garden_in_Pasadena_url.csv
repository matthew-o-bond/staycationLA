50,Hidden gem,What a wonderful hidden gem - I never knew it existed. I found it when I was looking at a google map of the area and the garden popped up. It's the COVID-19 days and as we were walking around while everyone kept their distance from each other. I love that they have so many sitting areas to relax and take in the quiet peaceful atmosphere. More cities need to add these gardens to their neighborhoods.,Creeping_Death_LA
30,Nice Community Garden,"It’s nice as a community garden to sit down and enjoy a peaceful afternoon in the shade; however, it is not a destination in itself. It is very small and overgrown. I like that it is overgrown because it gives more cover for animals. The birds were singing and some flowers were blooming. Overall, nice if you are in the area; but, not a place to go out of your way to get to.",teacherextraordinare

50,A gem of a garden,"I live about a 3 min. drive from the garden. I LOVE IT! It goes to show what vision, good design, and dedicated volunteers can create out of nothing. It's lost it's 2 founders, and is now being managed differently. I miss not going to the Art On Palm event there. Not sure why they can't include them ie. a great event and would earn the garden a nice income. Perhaps this needs to be re-thought for the future. Still love the place. Hope it succeeds going forward.",hbelleCalifornia
50,A great rustic and relaxing garden in the middle of urban chaos,"The Arlington Garden is a real hidden 100 karat diamond on the de facto 210 Freeway connector to the 110 Arroyo Parkway. It is located on 3 acres of land owned by Caltrans bought for the now defunct 710 Freeway. Leased by the City of Pasadena and run by a 501(c) non profit organization, the garden was inspired by Jan Smithen's book entitled ""Sun Drenched Gardens: The Mediterranean Style."" The founders have created a public, water-wise garden that celebrates Southern California’s Mediterranean climate and the garden demonstrates how beautiful and practical a well-planned, water-conserving and climate-appropriate garden can be. It is a joy to stroll through the various parts of the garden which have different themes and beautiful landscaping. A joy to sit and behold or stroll and have a great time.",geotech522

50,A Hidden Jewel,"I had heard about Arlington Garden for a few years, but never visited, choosing larger venues in the LA/Pasadena area. This visit was at the encouragement of my sister as a pleasant, uncrowded alternative.

It is intensely personal and soothing, a tribute to California species.",Randall W

50,Gardeners Should Not Miss This Extraordinary Garden,"Huntington is the grand dame of gardens and we loved our visit there, but we enjoyed the Arlington Gardens more. The plant combinations with an emphasis on combinign plants with contrasting leaf shapes and sizes, focal points featuring an attractive grouping of plants around artwork or planters, fabulous rows of columnar evergreens, private and pretty small seating areas that are often shaded, xersicape plants only, pretty winding pathways, great textural succulents and cacti... really a treat to visit.",Jane S
50,Take a trip to Italy,"Outstanding garden. One of the best, public or private. Quite large but with enough 'garden rooms' that I never felt it was crowded. Some lovely, inspirational hardscape design elements. Only thing that could make it better would be more plant info that is printed on the plant labels.

Great place to go and forget your cares for a while.",Andy1614

As you have no doubt figured out the Boss just loves the place.,David L
50,Great Place to Spend Some Quiet Time,"Very close to Huntington Hospital. Perfect quiet respite for a small picnic lunch - they have little tables. Plenty of shade umbrellas and little paths for the kids to explore and follow. Right off a VERy busy street, but once you're inside it's quiet - squirrels, birds, butterflies, calm.

It's really beautiful and somewhat secluded right off Pasadena Ave. Yet, once you're walking around inside, it's really cute and almost it's own little garden getaway. The people who curate it have really done wonders with this little space. Nice place to take pictures also. Come in the afternoon and enjoy the warm afternoon glow.",MrBalan
30,Very good for what it is,"This was an abandoned cal trans lot which a couple adopted and turned into a nice little garden. The signs in the park describe it as having several different ""rooms"" with different feel to them. There are several seating areas. When we were there two different couples were having picnic lunches. We walked most all the paths in about 15 minutes. There are some signs with qr codes and some interpretive signs too.I see reviews describing it as serene. That puzzles me as it borders Pasadena Ave, a very busy street with lots of traffic whizzing by. I guess if you lived nearby this would be a pleasant place to walk you dog or to sit and visit with a neighbor.I wouldn't say it is a place you would go out if your way to see. It is though on the way into Pasadena (from the south on the 110 freeway) so if you were visiting for the day it would be worth a stop. Especially if the Storrier Stearns Garden directly across the street were open it would make a good short outing. Or if you were at Huntington Hospital and wanted to go somewhere nearby and rest for a while.It is free.",So_Cal_Illini_81

50,Beyond expectations,"When I read about this park it seem like a small place to see native plants. On e we got there we notice although it appears small all the small trails and plants make this place feel much bigger. All within the park there are sitting areas. You may feel like a lot of families brought their yard furniture and made an area out of it. Some areas feel artistic other eclectic and other wild.I would not this a whole day activity, but it can be park of a day in the pasadena area. You can visit old pasadena, the tournament of roses park and the Arlington park.Fun and relaxing garden.",lxjuarez

30,Arlington is for the Able,"A friend and I visited the garden last week, on a warm sunny morning. We found nearby street parking, but from the info on the web I had expected there would be parking on site. The garden is not accessible for the handicapped, since we couldn't find a curb cut, and steps in the garden have no railings..If you are mobile and and enjoy hiking on trails, you will love the wilderness atmosphere. There is the bonus of many places to sit and read or have a little picnic. The garden was scented by a species of lilac I had never seen before. If there is access to drinking water, we did not encounter it, and we didn't have a map. If you can find that on the web, be sure to bring it, or enjoy exploring. It is indeed an unusual garden in the midsy of suburbia.",MARGARET L

I found Arlington Garden just five minutes from my house. It is a small garden with little bistro tables and chairs and Adirondack chairs placed in little nooks throughout the garden. There were several other people enjoying the garden when we were there but it seemed like we had the place to ourselves the way it is laid out. My dog enjoyed walking the different paths and smelling the different flowers and plants. I can just imagine that it is even more beautiful in the Spring. There are even orange trees that you are allowed to pick one orange for yourself to enjoy. It was very clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend you seek out this quiet little slice of heaven.,Debbie W
