50,hidden gem,"We've been to lots of aquariums and this was great for kids and adults. No, doesn't have the big tanks with sharks, but has lots of intersting small tanks and lots of explanations in different buildings. There is a touch tidal pond and much more. Check out all the buildings.It is free with donation asked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wineanddine32
40,Hidden Gem in San Pedro,Great little gem in San Pedro. This is not like the big aquariums that draw in the tourists. Much more of a native gem. Admission is by donation with a suggested donation of $5 per adult. Exhibits are small but informative. There is an interactive touch pool and you can cap the visit with a tour lead walk to the tide pools. This was a nice way to spend our afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanabear77
50,"Great location, free admission",My 6-year-old granddaughter loves visiting this aquarium in San Pedro. The highlight of the visit is always the Tidal Touch Pool! The exhibits of various sea creatures and the real skeletons of huge sea animals command attention.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63
30,It is ok,"It is small and there is not so much you can see. All your visit can last 30 minutes, but the good think is that it is free and the staff try to to their best to make and keep this aquarium interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
50,So much to see and learn here!,"What an amazing and fun little Aquarium! OK - it's not as flashy as the one in Long Beach (it also was not $$$ - suggested donation of $5 adults and $1 kids) and there were many things to do and see. My grandchildren loved the touch tank, the seahorses and jellies. There are multiple exhibits and the staff couldn't be more friendly and really wanted to get the kids involved. We learned so much about the ocean environment and local sea life. Based on fun events coming up (Sea Scare and Grunion Runs) it made total sense to buy a family membership for the year for $75.00 - much less than one day would cost at an amusement park. Even the library is amazing, the kids loved the special children's area. It's right on the beach with a picnic area, playground and well stocked gift shop, really can't ask for more for a nice family day out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thankgodforbooks
10,You get what you pay for.,"The place is a disgrace. Free is free, and you get what you pay for. Dated, smelly, tiny, old. Go to Long Beach and invest in an experience. The “manager” here Matt yelled at my wife and autistic son, so the place is also apparently run by bigot/bullies who don’t welcome children of all abilities. All that aside, it’s just not a nice aquarium. Not even a good one. I wouldn’t recommend it even if you’re dirt poor, because you’re still losing hours of your life on a crappy experience that will leave you mentally out of pocket, if not financially.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scarlettba
50,Family FUN,"The best interactive low-priced ($5 donation) aquarium experience. Touch tank with starfish, anenomes, even sharks. Tide pools,beaches, fire pits and pier nearby.Easy access, parking at beautiful Cabrillo Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catmanlarry
30,Small local museum,"Located feet away from the beach, this small aquarium is a nice spot to learn about various sea life. Great place for families with small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PepperNewJersey
40,Cabrillo Marine Aquarium Tour,"This aquarium has lots to see from fish tanks to touch tanks to beautiful (?) jellyfish. That is not all Habitats Hall shows though for there are exhibits showing the natural habitat of other species of the surrounding area. There are wildlife exhibits, bird displays, and snakes and lizards and such. Also there is a separate building called the Aquatic Nursery to explore sea horses aquaculture protecting certain species along with research projects. Now I’ve seen larger aquariums, but this shows a good example of what most people do not get to see in when they visit the seashore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,the wedding,This was a perfect place to go not only for the wedding but wedding on the beach!! Two events at the same time no one can complain!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terridavidson82
30,Free small aquarium,"Well its free admission so can't complain too much, the interior is a little run down and smells fishy but the creatures are well maintained and look happy. You can see some interesting Jellyfish and even seahorses. Its worth a stop with young ones if you need a inexpensive day out. You can relax on the beach at Pedro afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Amazing Aquarium Excellent for Kids,"Unlike famous aquariums in Chicago and Monterey, Cabrillo is run on donations and caters to kids and school field trips. Beware, on any given day more than 300 kids could be around.Once you pay your $5 donation, you will enjoy quite an extension collection of marine life in various settings. Kids of all ages will love the selection. There is a touch tank but only open for tours at certain hours (during the week not open until 1:30PM).There is also in interactive center where you can check out artifacts and spend at least 30-60 minutes. Another area you can see how marine life comes to be.Right across the way from the beach which features a small playground and bathhouse. Good idea is to bring a picnic lunch and also to visit the USS Iowa a few minutes away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LGspartan
50,Excellent small local museum,"I have been going to this museum ever since I was a child, I really like going here, a nice place to stroll and relax. Some of the old whale bones are the same ones when I was a kid. They also have a small tide pool pond where you can touch the marine life. Kids really like this this. In the other building adjacent to the museum, there is a marine laboratory and a gift shop. Enough things to see without getting saturated. The tide pools and the beach are in walking distance, so you can make it an event for the entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esethebomb
40,Old school but very cool,"Very informative exhibits with a great combination of detail and live animals. This was a great couple of hours checking out live developing shark embryo, lots of jellyfish, sea horses, star fish, and the list goes on. Loved this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckC545
50,Perfect for a young family,"We had never been to this aquarium before (had been to many others) which is on the small side, but oh so perfect! We planned this cub scout activity (in conjunction to the Pt Fermin Lighthouse) over a year ago and had a PERFECT day. The young boys loved it here. They were able to go at their own pace and ohh and ahhh at everything, then we turned around to pick up what we missed before going to the little nursery area, then into the touch pools. This was such a great activity for younger people and tight budgets (we operate on pretty much nothing but CAN afford to make donations). We saw plenty of new and exciting things we had never seen before at larger aquariums. We will come back with grandkids. The day was a major hit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjsr
50,Lots to do inside and out,"We drove out from the desert on a Friday to explore this free museum with no real expectations, ended up having a thoroughly enjoyable day with my 3 and 6 yr old. The aquarium is on the small side but there are so many displays of live specimens, models and skeletons hanging from the ceiling, a small touch tank in the back with large, colorful starfish and anemones, and a great exploration room with stuff under microscopes and more live specimens. The beach is right outside- no waves, combed sand, and a playground -perfect for my younger kids, they loved it! The real tide pools are a short walk away, as well. Lots of anemones, snails, and tiny crabs. Again, my kids loved hiking over the rocks and looking for sealife. The place was practically empty, it was great, and parking was super cheap!Cost- free but suggested donation $5/personParking- $1/hour, AMAZINGDownside- traffic leaving town is a nightmare during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B2823EHalisonc-s
50,Exciting for kids,"A free entrance , though they recommend $5/adult and $1/child. Our 3 yr old grandson loved the exhibits. We spent about an hour there and were never bored. Not a large commercial aquarium, but a value alternative. You can also go to Cabrillo Beach across the parking lot or tide pools about 3 miles away at White Point Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisVal
50,Not a big fan of the large aquariums..... this is a jem,"This little place was enjoyable and educational, we gave a $5 donation per adult and spent 4 very enjoyable hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacG4605RS
50,Nice Easy visit,"Easy to spend an hour or more. Lots to see. Volunteers on the weekend, youn teens very knowledgeable about their subject. Very reasonable admission. My guess would be 50 exhibits in one building. A second building was really neat with a lot of hands on things for young children. Also a library and gift shop with snacks. All ans all very nice time for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judpma012
50,Such an awesome little Aquarium next to the ocean and free!,"This truly is one of the better aquariums. While it may not be the most nicely decorated ones, but it houses some pretty awesome sea creatures. admission is free, but please donate to help support such an awesome organization. Besides the main displays area which houses a LOT of live and preserved specimens. It has a kiddy area where they can interact and learn. expect to spend at least half a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fr0stiex
40,Cool philantropic research center.,"They seams to be focused on their research and preservation of water environment. And we are visitors that can look at it while they are working. That was cool. Free entré. We donated 30 USD for seeing the place and visiting the mens room. Our children likes it, too! Plan for one to two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonasr890
40,Lovely little aquarium - great educational value!,"What a lovely little aquarium this is. Focused largely on education, this was a great place to come to with kids. It helped break-up a regular beach day and the kids ended up spending hours in there. There is a touch pool and different tanks with animals to look at and they have an arts table and pretend play corner to extend (and possibly deepen) the experience.This aquarium is a great way to introduce kids to the local marine life (that they can actually see in the nearby tide pools by the ocean). It puts things into context and thus has great educational value. It's not overcrowded and has ample (paid) parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ReiseB
40,Well worth it!,Got to see an octopus pick up a rock. I was impressed. Was interesting to see things I have never seen before. Easy parking. Nice staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7924WRsarahg
40,$5 well spent,Very nice place to spend some time inside. Ample parking and very friendly staff. Touch tank was a big hit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
40,Showing its age but still free,"I love this place! A little free gem at a beach forgotten by most. Start your day by checking the tide charts and go at low tide. The staff can tell you how to walk to the tide pools along the cliffs. Enjoy nature naturally (wear appropriate shoes) and then go inside and learn about what you saw.Cabrillo has a live education/teaching lab now too and we had the opportunity to interact with very sharp high schoolers tending to their experiments.If you can, check out a Grunion Run. Great late night fun watching fish spawn in the sand.There is also a live tide pool touch tank that opens on a schedule so either plan ahead or be flexible.Bring a picnic to enjoy at the beach and make a day of learning and wonder.Great staff who are almost all volunteer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglasl16
30,Interesting stop,The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is a fun place to stop and learn about many of the creatures that inhabit the nearby Pacific Ocean. Worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Fun,"This is a fun place. It's a local, educational aquarium. If you're looking for a large aquarium, with beautiful displays, you should go to the Aquarium of the Pacific. If you're interested in a smaller local place, with friendly staff, this it's your spot. We went for a grunion run, and thought the program was wonderful (even the 1960s film) and well organized. We'd recommend this to guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinnesotaFamily2
50,Totally awesome for a more personal and educational visit,I love aquariums. I wanted to go to Aquarium of Pacific but lateness of day and tiredness of child dictated an alternative. Since we were in San Pedro we decided to go here instead. Wonderful! Get right up to tanks. Learns about various creatures. Had a touch tanks. Got to hatch Grunions. This is a research place and has a library and lab. If I lived in town I would visit frequently. Would have loved to pair with visit to beach - big wide sandy beach - but water quality was bad that day. Oh And donation recommended - way better than Aq of Pac. Recommend for ages 4-up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynthiatucker
40,Hidden Gem,"If you're looking for a fun and inexpensive way to spend the afternoon, try a visit to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. The staff are extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions and the exhibits are really nicely done and very informative. Kids will love that there are signs every that say, ""Please Touch"" which is just the opposite of what you might expect. I visited on a recent solo trip and can't wait to bring my entire family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summervacationeer
50,Great Aquarium,"The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is lesser known and smaller compared to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, but it packs just more bang for the buck!The Aquarium is free to enter, but has a suggested donation of $5 per adult.They have several exhibits that are easy to navigate, and their touch pool is nice and big so everyone can enjoy it at the same time. They have some unique exhibits that you wouldn't see at another aquarium.They also have a great program where you can hatch grunion eggs inside little jars. The grunion are released into the wild, and hopefully, will return the following year during one of the grunion runs.This truly is one of the best kept secrets in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burculian
50,Wow! So much to learn and see!,"The quality of the exhibits and resource/educational information is awesome! I found some of the exhibits to be MUCH more interesting and complex than those at the Aquarium of the Pacific because there are more species, more natural ecosystems and more natural objects in each of the exhibits. There are fewer tanks and exhibits overall, though, but if you're interested in quality over quantity, you have it here.Of course you won't get some of the species here that you will at Aquarium of the Pacific, but you also won't be paying an arm and a leg! This place is donation-based and if you really can't afford it, you don't have to pay, or you can just give $5 or whatever you can to help continue the maintenance and educational value of the place.The depth and breadth of educational info is also incredible! You could spend an hour just browsing through, or you could easily spend ALL DAY here learning, or watching the miniature ecosystems work along, doing different things. The touch pool is a very good one, too. There's a special building where they raise baby marine creatures, and another for hands-on learning activities. The gift shop is also really great, with lots of fun and very educational items at good prices!We're going back soon, we can highly recommend this little GEM!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinSPH
50,"Hidden gem, lots to see/learn awesome tide pools nearby",We had a wonderful afternoon of discovery and informative exhibits. Go in after 2 pm to avoid school groups. The layout is easy to walk through. A great alternative to spending big $ at the Aquarium of the Pacific. They ask for a donation to keep this wonderful place running. We liked the predatory snail display. They also had shark egg sacks with baby developing sharks easy to view. Look up the low tide levels and try to visit the nearby tide pools. There you can see many sea anemones hermit crabs etc.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T1656CIjenniferf
40,"Interesting, Educational Small Aquarium!","A little tired of long days of driving and sightseeing in Southern California, we wanted to find a few fun things to do in the San Pedro area. The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium was a pleasant three generation family experience. Admission is free, but donations are encouraged! It is a small aquarium that focuses on Southern California marine life. It is very educational and the exhibits are interesting and entertaining. There is also a small touch-tank that my grandchildren enjoyed. The staff were all friendly, knowledgeable and helpful! We enjoyed our time at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKTBE
50,"Wonderful ""Little"" Aquarium","Better than expected, some told us not to bother if we've been to the bigger exhibits. I felt it was still well worth the effort. Docents were very friendly, most passionate about their topic & apparently very knowledgeable. The displays were well done and illustrated the sea creatures nicely within their budget constraints. A couple hours flew by touring the relatively small facility. Check their website for the dates of the terrific Grunion eventsHighly recommend to all ocean lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockrotator2016
50,Enhancing our world with education and respect,"I recently was faced with end of year donation requests. When an article written by a young person stated the importance and respect he gained and promoted about our ocean, my decision was easily made. Yes I joined and doubled my senior dues this time. Right away I started receiving emails about events and am going to one this weekend with a friend, Tide pool walk. Also visited the gift shop and was warmly greeted by the lovely lady who runs it. I asked her about acquiring my cards to sell there as I am an artist and thought my ocean birds and underwater scenes may go well there. We chatted and I look forward to many more visits. Also visited the nursery to see the sea horses and jelly fish and baby rays. Really wonderful being a part of this, thanks!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabelsart
50,Beautiful rainy day,A nice little getaway w/my son. When you think you've seen it all there are more creatures I've learned about,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/344margaretv
50,Hidden treasure of an aquarium,"This aquarium, no admission fee, is dedicated to the marine life of Southern California. Research and educational projects to view with tanks of jellys, fish, and all one would find close to shore in the local area. Perfect for all ages, with staff and volunteers to answer questions and increase your understanding of the local marine environment. You'll be happy you visited and will want to donate to their facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nana672016
50,Great for kids of all ages!,"This is not your typical marine aquarium. It is on a smaller scale with more emphasis on helping the environment and conservation. There is a moderate sized touch tank with different type of marine life for the kids to actually handle under the supervision of a museum official.Admission is free but a donation of $5 is suggested. This is a really good destination for kids (especially in the 2-6 year old range) because it is adjacent to a small, calm beach with no waves and a great grass area complete with a few different playgrounds for the kids to enjoy. Restrooms are nearby and while not fancy, are definitely serviceable. Parking is the real cost here, you might spend a few hours if your kids are having fun. Great photo opportunity here as well.If you like to fish there is another nearby spot for fishing on a concrete pier. The opposite side of Cabrillo beach has another, just as pretty, sandy beach with big waves for bigger kids or surfers. With the weather being so nice year round, you don't have to come here just in the summer.Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
40,Beachfront Museum,Great place to teach and learn about marine biology on your way across the parking lot to the actual beach! Fun for kids and adults with $1 or $5 donation to enter.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RozDe
50,Home town Tourist - preferred destination,"Hidden jewel - especially if you have kids to delight & entertain them for a few hours. The exhibitions are fascinating & the museum is small & well designed flow allows for giving kids some autonomy/opportunity to get lost And explore. Afterward a hike along the trails around Cabrillo beach to tide pools or picnic at the beach is really nice and makes for an easy, affordable day.For older kids I recommend checking out the excursions 1/2 day & full day trips for whale watching or learning about our local coast. Get them out of their comfort zone!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hampy8
50,Great aquarium and beach stop,We were debating between Cabrillo and the larger aquarium in the area. We decided on Cabrillo and were so happy we did!The aquarium entrance is by donation ($5 adult and $1 child is appreciated donation). Parking is by the hour but reasonable with a $9 max. The aquarium and beach share the same lot. We were there about 90 minutes and our kids ages 11-1 were all engaged the whole time.The museum is focused on local species. They have a great tide pool touch tank. The best part was at the tank we were talking to an aquarium employee and she pointed us to a place down the beach and tide time to go find urchins and other animals. We then headed out to the beach and spent a few hours exploring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herd_of_6
40,Fun and educational,"This is a must whether you're on your way to the beach or just a visit. The aquarium is not big, but has enough things to see and do to keep kids of all ages entertain. They have a touch tank, many exhibits, a library, nursery, and gift shop. Entrance fee is based on donations. They have a lot of helpful docents. And, if you're up to it, you can take a short hike to the public tide pools and see nature in action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7511QWhelenc
50,Awesome FREE Aquarium! So much to learn!,"I came all the way the from Arkansas to visit the Cabrillo Aquarium. Well, for family and stuff too, but this really well-done place was on the list. Compared to many zoos and aquariums the Cabrillo packs in so much more information and explanation into its many exhibits. We could have spent all day. We also went nuts in the gift store to support the place. Go visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skippydg
50,Cool place,"Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is a great educational and research facility. We walked the whole area and saw all the exhibits in a little over an hour. The price was a suggested donation of $1.00 for seniors and children and $5.00 for adults. $10.00 entrance is well worth the price. They have tons of live sea life in natural setting tanks. They have several different species of star fish, some are huge. They have live jellyfish, octopus, Sharks, snails, kelp forest and many more live plants and creatures. They have a live touch pool for the kids and adults I suppose, we left before it opened. They also have a nurseries for pacific seahorse and other species. This nursery is staffed by students and volunteer scientists in a great learning atmosphere. They also have a aquaculture kitchen growing algae doing studies and running experiments on living sea animals both helping endangered species and as a sustainable food sources. We enjoyed out afternoon and recommend those with or without children to come enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870eileens
10,Your parking meter is a POS!,"We got there early at 7:45pm for the grunion run last night, very unfortunately. Only thing good about it was we found a good parking space. However the parking meter is a joke be prepared to use a credit card because it won't give you change! It's a POS because it offers you parking for $3.50 for parking until 11:59pm and yet it does not accept coins! So I inserted $4.00 and it didn't know what to do next and just froze. I pushed different buttons and must have pushed a wrong button somehow and ended up voiding my transaction and printed me out a receipt that says no refunds. So it basically ate my $4.00 and I had to scramble to find a credit card and at the same time with a long line behind me. The aquarium itself was good for 30 min where you see small aquarium exhibits and a short grunion film from 1960. The rest 2.5 hours before you can actually go to the beach and catch some grunions we just went back to our car and rested. The grunion run didn't start until 11:30pm and their parking lot closes at 12:00 midnight. Just about the most idiotic set up you can imagine. There you are with a thousand people on the beach going after the few grunions that are out there and you have 30min to do that. Luckily our kids were good and we caught a couple and released them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daikin
40,Good Diversion For Young Kids,"We headed to the Cabrillo beach to get away from the heat. Saw the museum nearby. They accept donations (suggested $5 per adult, $1 per child). Parking is $1 per hour.Nice fish tanks inside with lots of small sea animals. Our 5 year old son was most interested in the tide pool exhibit. His next favorite thing in the aquarium was a play area where he could dress up in a stingray costume and play with sea animal puppets, like a lobster. Some of the buttons on some of the exhibits were not working. They have a nice library upstairs, with a particular emphasis on children's books dealing with aquatic life.Originally thought we would finish the aquarium in an hour, but my son found things to amuse himself, like a mural painted like a shark, and he could stick his head in the mouth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Wonderful place to spend a few hours with Toddlers,"Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is a great place to go to if youre looking for a fun and inexpensive way to spend the day with your kids. My kids are 4 and 2 years old and they had a fun time. As other reviewers have stated, its not as big as the Aquarium of the Pacific (which we had also been to) but its still a great place to visit and definitely a good place for the kids to learn some things about sea animals. There is no set admission price, they operate on donations only so please give give give! My kids loved the display with the jellyfish and the little crayfish and even the room dedicated to sharks and whales. Across the way is the beach and nice views of the Pacific. Parking is about 1.00 an hour which you have to prepay before you leave your car at little kiosks that will dispense a ticket for your dash once youve paid. We stayed for about 2 hours which was more than enough time to take in the whole aquarium ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaAllen
30,Grunion run,"We came for the grunion run. It was interesting but a little disappointing. We got tickets online. Did not save us time in line and it was more expensive. Also paid parking with automated meter was confusing. Person in front of me did not have coins or credit (dollar bills not taken). He left and when I tried to pay for me mine I paid for his. ArghYou get into the aquarium around 8, see a short film, and they let you hatch some grunion eggs. That was cool. But then we had to waste time until 10:30 before we went to the beach. Other people were there who did not buy tickets. But parking may be an issue if you do go via the aquarium.Disappointing part was the grunions came ashore too far away. Took about an hour before we were allowed to go into that area and there were maybe 40 on the beach at a time. I was expecting more. If you go, stand where the sandy beach is, the closest spot. And don't go where the rocks are. Only a couple came by the rocks.The museum itself is geared to educating young children. Only entertains an adult for 30 minutes or so",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4253QTcarlosr
50,Day With Grandson,I just heard of this Aquarium and it's been here 80 years!!!! What a fine everything is geared for touching. Loved it and the price was great!!! $5 for Adults and $1 for Kinds and Sebiors they have tidepools across the street. and a small one inside this is a find! Parking $1 an hour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaB540
40,Great time visiting,I had a great time visiting. I would have to say the Georgia Aquarium was better but this wasn't too bad either! Would recommend visiting at least one though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redrocke
50,Wonderful educational facility for both children and adults,"My nine-year-old granddaughter loves to visit Cabrillo Marine Acquarium and now I know why. It is obvious their goal is to educate and they do a wonderful job. I really enjoyed our visit and my granddaughter was so excited to show me all the wonderful exhibits, including the seahorses she has watched grow up, the nursery, and the tide pool touch area. Enjoyed this aquarium so much more that the larger, commercial one nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PasCaLady
50,Best outing for a family,We love the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium for their great learning experience offered to the guests of all ages. the Aquarium is also very creative for the activities offered. We choose the all day at sea by Catalina Island experience. real Hands on science on board and quite a day away from the city.This Museum is definitely less commercial than other outfits in the same area code and more geared towards shaping the next generation of lovers for all the marine life that California offers.Enjoy the great volunteers on staff while visiting !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meherio
40,Good spot to entertain young kids for 1-2 hours,"This aquarium is small but works very well for entertaining young kids for a couple of hours. There is a touch tank they can explore (during certain times) and plenty of exhibits in the enclosed area. We went on a weekday and there were only a couple dozen others there. The staff was very friendly. Our children aren't old enough to read all of the exhibits, so just about the time they started to get bored of looking into the various tanks, we were through everything. Entry fee is a donation, which is nice since it is small so you wouldn't want to pay a huge amount to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivaLaVida98101
30,Decent afternoon with the kids,"Cabrillo Aquarium is right across the parking lot from Cabrillo beach. Being on the smaller side, we were done in less than 2 hours. If you wanted to come to the aquarium and then make a beach afternoon out of it, you'd probably have a decent and fairly inexpensive afternoon. Parking wasn't horrible, $1.00 per hour. The aquarium doesn't have set prices, they ask for donations instead. I gave them $20 for a group of 8. Not bad considering Aquarium of the Pacific charges $28.95 per adult just to get in. They had some really good creatures to see. Giant star fish, giant lobsters, eels, crabs. No seals or otters or rays like at Aquarium of the Pacific. But it's definitely enough to keep your attention. The displays are well kept and super clean. They also had this cool set up where you see the tanks from the front, and then when you turn the corner, you can find a darker hallway and suddenly you're seeing the tanks from the back! And the kids had fun with this because then they kept seeing each other through the tanks and waving. They do have a touch tank area, but it only opens for 20 min and they announce it to you over a loud speaker. We enjoyed the whale section where there were life sized whale bones on display to give you an idea of how huge these creatures really are. I had a group of kids ranging from 13 years old to 2.5 years old. The 13 year old hated the experience. She said there was an odor everywhere and was bored for most of the trip. The 10 year olds and 6 year old enjoyed themselves just fine. I felt it was the right size for the 2.5 year old. No stroller needed, it's not that big. It gave him enough room to explore without it being too crowded or large of an attraction where he could get lost. They also have a lovely library upstairs with books about the sea and animals. Nice to have a few quiet min where the kids could color and we could get some nice a/c on a hot day. They also have an area with hand puppets and costumes for the kids to dress up in. We took some pics and had a few laughs. Again, geared more toward little kids. My teenager couldn't wait to leave. We packed our lunches and had them in a backpack and they had a really nice shaded courtyard where we just sat down and ate when it was time. No one bothered us, so I assumed it was ok! I would also like to compliment them on their bathrooms. They were VERY clean and ample. Being a mom of four, I can appreciate a clean bathroom for kids & families. All in all, it's a step down from Aquarium of the Pacific, but if you're on a budget, I'd say to go, at least once. I wasn't crazy about the touch tank. Not too many creatures in it and the fact that it was crowded because they only open it for 20 min. If you really want a good experience getting to touch sea life, go to The Sea Lab in Redondo Beach. I've reviewed that and actually prefer it to Cabrillo Aquarium. It's also on a donations system and you get a 1 hour tour with a docent who will tell you cool information about the animals and you'll get to touch WAY more things. So if you're on a budget, have an afternoon to kill and maybe want to hit the beach afterwards, I'd say check out Cabrillo Aquarium. But if your kids are too old, then you may want to skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenaC647
40,Small and Quaint,"I've been to this place too many times to count since I was a kid for field trips and luckily it's gotten better through the years. They are a small aquarium compared to the one in Long Beach, but it's great for a day trip and less expensive. It has a great location next to a small beach with playground equipment for the kids and plenty of picnic tables in tree shaded areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMT504
50,Great aquarium,"This aquarium is a great deal, has a wealth of information and the exhibits are fun for adults and kids. There is no fee but a suggested donation of $5/personI would definitely recommend young couples, families with kids and seniors to take a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnotton
40,Still a Great Hands On Aquarium,"Cabrillo Marine Aquarium reminds me of an aquarium built in someone's garage. This aquarium continues to be a great hands on place for learning. They bring the Ocean to you! Funky, small, accessible, awe-inspiring, and the entry fee is a donation to keep the aquarium running. Go, enjoy, and learn in an uninhibited environment. And the location is breathtaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
40,"Good for kids, you can go see tide pools with some of these animals nearby in the wild.","Small Aquarium more suited to younger kids. No admission cost for the museum. You have the Cabrillo State Beach in the same parking area. If you want a big aquarium with sharks and yellow fin tuna, go to the Long Beach Aquarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276kevinp
40,nice quaint aquarium,"This aquarium was directly across from the beach/ocean we went to stick our feet in. There was no cost, only a suggested donation which was minimal. It's a small facility but with a lot of information and animals. There was a hands on area for the entire family which was cool. This was a spur of the moment place to visit and we are glad we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecC4863MA
20,Not worth the drive out there,"If you're in the area, go to the Long Beach Aquarium, don't bother with this one. It reminded me of a visit to an elementary school that was having an open house. Yes, they have some small things in tanks like baby fish, some sea urchins, sea stars, and they have some bones that have washed up on the beach, but to truly appreciate our marine life off the coast of California, you have so many other better aquariums to see. The Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, the Long Beach Aquarium, the Monterey Aquarium - all of them are much better. So if you have a choice, go there. Otherwise, this is a cute visit if you happen to be at the nearby beach with the little kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalEncinitas
50,Why fight the crowds? This is a terrific aquarium.,"The ""donation"" will not break the bank like other aquariums in the area and the docents and learning stations are wonderfully done. The kids loved this aquarium and we all learned something! The displays are very well done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/autotraveler10
50,Wonderful Experience,"My family had a great time. There is so much to learn about sea life; very educational. There is an area where you can touch certain animals and the staff is there to provide you with information and answer questions. Aside from live animals, there are also many fossils you can see. They also have the lab where you can visit and you can observe certain species or parts of animals through microscopes. You can also see the staff's work in progress. There is really no entrance fee, but a small donation to help feed the animals. It is so good that we can all help preserve this wonderful aquarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123sylviar
50,Cabrillo Aquarium,"This little place is really cool, and it's all done by donations, so it's just really neat that they keep it going just to preserve the history of the sealife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39donnah
50,Perfect size for little kids.,"this is an awesome museum and aquarium. It includes live animals as well as fossils. Perfect for visiting as an educational outing. Not too big nor boring. It allows kids to touch several animals and it has a fun hands on learning area with displays, theater,experiments etc. I had a hard time getting my kids to leave. It is in front of the beach with a nice picnic area and playground where we spent the afternoon. A great place to visit leisurely,stroller friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/950marm
40,Up-close sea creatures,"There's not much reason to go to San Pedro unless you're embarking on a cruise, but the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is a pleasant diversion. They've made the most of a relatively small space, and it's very clean and easy to navigate. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and the admission price makes it a real bargain: technically free, but a suggested donation of $5 for adults and $1 for children and seniors (compared to the $15-$60 range at the Long Beach Aquarium). Even the gift shop prices are reasonable! Cabrillo offers lots of educational activities for kids and grown-ups, and off-site they conduct research and a periodic census of marine life in the area. There's even a working laboratory that's open to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VagabondKatt
50,Wonderful Visit for the Family,"Set right next to a very pleasant beach and tide pool, this aquarium is not the most flashy attraction, but easily does a wonderful job in educating visitors on marine wildlife. Parking is $1 an hour, but admittance is free (they encourage donations) and I believe most of the employees are volunteers. These volunteers are very cheery and extremely helpful. The displays are educational and enjoyable for kids and adults. My family and I really like the touch pool. Once your done learning, you can go enjoy the tide pool and beach!Throw in a picnic, and it's a great way to spend a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeisterTibbs
50,Worth the Visit!,"Thank you, Trip Advisor, for the good reviews that convinced us to visit the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium.Kids will enjoy this place. The touch tank tide pool is a highlight, and there are quite a few exhibits that our nephews (ages 8 and 5) enjoyed. They were thrilled to see the leopard sharks and the eel on the other side (non-touch) area of the tank. The $5 suggested donation for admission is very reasonable. We spent about a couple of hours and that seemed fine for a visit.The main building has the touch tank and the other tank exhibits, which grab the kids’ attention. The buildings on the other side of the aquarium have more of research focus, and they’ve set up several things to engage kids with microscopes at their height level, etc.All of the staff were friendly and helpful including suggesting a nearby place for lunch.Parking is easy, inexpensive and plentiful.Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cagarcia1
40,Fun Little Aquarium.. Worth the Visit,"This aquarium has... only $5 suggested donation admission.Touch Tank Tide Pool where you can touch urchins, sea stars, and anemonegiant lobsters, and many other marine animals, a fish nursery, marine museum section, and a cute little gift shop. Parking is just a dollar an hour and it is located in San Pedro near a great beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781bettym
50,Perfect family place!,"The aquarium is nice with many fishes and other sea creatures; It takes 1-2 hours to see it depending on how much details you want to look at. There was no entrance fee but you could donate to feed fish. The aquarium is located near the beach where you can visit the aquarium, prepare a barbeque and spend afternoon swimming and enjoying sun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vita_n_81
50,Very Good,"We came here in March. I wanted to go somewhere different after visiting the Long Beach aquarium last year so we decided on the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium. This place was really good and it proves that it is not the size of the attraction that is important but the quality. This place was educational and being able to spend time with some of the sea creatures was really worthwhile. There happened to be a special event, on the evening that we visited, to see the grunion run so we came to see that. It was really interesting and very worthwhile if you are around on those special days when they run this grunion program.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419KenL
50,Perfect for families,"Spent a few hours at this impressive little aquarium. We have visited lots of aquarium around the USA and this one is small but so educational. My kids (10, 9, 7 years old) all loved it and wanted to stay longer. They have 2 sides to visit and make sure you do since they are both totally different and both awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123Veronica123
50,Unique and worthwhile,There are displays here that will awe you even if you've visited larger aquariums. You pay for parking and a donation is suggested. There are tide pools there so check the tide schedule and visit the museum beforehand to know what to look for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandaw974
50,"Focus is on the animals, not a fancy building.","Our group of 10 (ages 5 to 70+) were blown away by this aquarium. We've been to lots of aquariums and this was our favorite. While it's not at all fancy, the exhibits are really interesting and it's clear that the animals are well-cared for. We saw things there that other aquariums don't have. The requested donation of $5/adult $1/kid is well worth it, but they aren't pushy about asking you to pay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The touch tank was a favorite with the kids and the staff was SOOOO patient. We really liked the ""pickled"" deep sea fish and the shark/skate eggs that were backlit so you could see the live animals inside. We would definitely go back. There is also beach access there with picnic tables.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanneD1
50,THE BEST LITTLE AQUARIUM,This is a fantastic place especially if you have kids and money is tight. It's FREE!! It's right off the beach so when your done you can go play in the sand. There are a lot of hands on exhibits and a tide pool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/579kk
50,Intimate and easy!,"We visited here last weekend with a 4 year-old and a 7 year-old. They had a delightful time. They really enjoyed the touch tank and the jellyfish exhibits. They suggest a donation, but the facility is free- what a treat! They also have an awesome summer program for older kids. And you are right at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarbaraF388
50,An Aquarium that loves and nurtures animals. Excellent place!,"5 star for CMA. Mike, the director runs this place fantastic. He cares about all the details and it shows. This is my favorite Aquarium in Southern CA. All the animals are well taken care of and loved. They are family here not just an exhibit. I have been coming here for years and my Twin girls volunteered here for years as well. Everyone is a joy to speak with and the care and effort that goes behind the scenes is exceptional. All the donations are used properly and the animals benefit. This places teaches you so much about the ocean and the treasures it has. All schools should come here and bring the kids so they can learn valuable information. The volunteers and employees go out of their way to teach the visitors. Their events are fun and well planned. There is a lot to see so don't let the size fool you. Entry is also very affordable compared to other Aquariums. You do pay for parking but CMA has no control over that. If you are visiting do come here. You will see how animals eat, what they are fed and how a place like this takes good care of them. Join the tours and do visit the beach. It is a learning experience and a joy to see the little creatures being happy. The Moon Jelly Fish dance in their tanks and the Octopi show off their array of colors. Go see the lab which gives you an idea of some of the special things CMA does. Take a look at the shark eggs and don't forget the touch tanks. Your donations and visit helps this place continue and helps it nurture our sea creatures. This is also a famous place where TV crews come out and even a movie was shot here on location. I am glad CMA is here and all the teachings it provided to my children and myself. I will return many more times and for years! Come visit and learn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeataBallo
30,Inexpensive learning opportunity,"The aquarium requests a $5 donation per adult, and $1 per child. They have a fair number of exhibits, and are not as commercialized as other local, and much more expensive aquariums. There are not large marine mammals, just fish, crustaceans and the like. They do have an added bonus of a tide pool near by. Its not very large, but is down by the beach, so between that and the aquarium, you might be able to make a day of it. We were able to see everything (except the movie) at the aquarium in under two hours. We helped hatch grunions, which was kind of neat. Also, you must pay for parking - $1 / hour up to a $15 max per day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPVTravelmore
50,A better alternative to higher-priced aquarium attractions,"The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is one of those gems that families should discover in another hidden gem of a city: San Pedro.The aquarium is great for young children and has many large tank displays of various marine life, including a touch tank that is open several times each day and my daughter's favorite - a tank that stimulates wave activity. I've brought my daughter there several times with friends and they are always engaged and delighted by a close-up look at the colorful starfish, clams (watching them eat with long tendrils is a real treat), collections of fish, spiny lobsters, etc. The touch tank is a great opportunity to reach in and gently contact anemones, starfish, etc.The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is also well-known for it's research division and fish nursery, where school groups often come during the week to see how work is being done to nuture the marine environment. Children can do craft activities or even dress up in sea creature costumes and perform.There are opportunities for those interested in marine science to come and volunteer too.Best part of this experience is the price: donations! You can give as much as you want, and for a family this makes a wonderful day's outing. There is also a gift shop and a lot of educational aspects to teaching the importance of keeping the oceans clean and healthy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veewat
40,What a fun afternoon.,"My dad and I spent the afternoon at the aquarium. Very nice place, not the biggest or best by far, but for a small donation of $5.00 per person it was pretty cool. The tide pools are not that good, but saw quite a few Sea Hares. The Laguna Tide pools at Shaw's Cove are much better. All in all I would recommend a visit here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Firemann2003
40,Great little afternoon outing!,"Looking for something different to do with the kids? I've been bringing my kids here since they were old enough to walk and well now they are 12 and 13. We come every few years to see the tanks full of sea life and participate in the outside tide pool where you can see and touch some small animals. My kids and I have always had a good time and it's fairly inexpensive. Once, you're done with the aquarium, you can take a walk on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Older but a good one,I remember coming here when I was a little kid and I always thought it was the coolest place. So when my husband and I were in the area I said we had to go visit. There is technically no admission but we gave the recommended $5 donation for admission for each of us. The aquarium is older but it has this certain feel to it that you just don’t get at the other aquariums. The exhibits all showcase animals from California. I would recommend you visit this aquarium and then if you want more to visit the Aquarium of the Pacific. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and they even have a cute little gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsummer22
40,Mellow Visit,Enjoyed the open air aspect of the museum. Friendly staff. Sandy beach. Allow 90min for museum. $5 donation. $1/hr to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelmog
40,"Great combo - aquarium, beach, tide pools, pier","The aquarium is located in a state park which seemed very popular even at 9 AM on Sunday. There were lots of people set up to picnic and cook out, and many early fishers on the very long pier. We enjoyed walking the beach and pier, watching the pelicans and surf boarders, and then walking out to the rocky beach edge to examine the anemones and crabs in the tide pools. After that we went to the aquarium, which had many interesting exhibits and close-up tide pool tanks. We spent about 5 hours at the park all together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlbob
40,Better than expected,"My adult daughter and I visited this aquarium on the spur of the moment while touring other sights in San Pedro. We were pleasantly surprised by both the quantity and quality of the displays. Between the touch tanks, aquariums with descriptions, and employees answerering our endless questions, we learned a tremendous amount about the marine life in this area. This was a much more personel experience than the big aquariums we have visited. Admission is a suggested $5 for adults, and parking is $1 an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbielab
40,Fun for all ages,"This aquarium proves entertaining for toddlers to older folks. We especially love the touch tanks and unique displays. Yes, the aquarium is dated but it still provides information that is relevant today. There is something at every turn. PLUS- the tide pools are close by as well. Parking is easy and admission is by donation. Such a great stop with amazing views to boot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srfangel33
40,"Nice aquarium, ""interesting"" area","I went to this aquarium because I had a mandatory assignment to go there for my Marine Biology class. That being said, both my boyfriend and I had a great time! It was much less crowded than the Long Beach aquarium, and the marine life was much more diverse. Coming from LA, it probably isn't somewhere I would go all the time, but I'm glad we went. The only problem I had with it is its location. Frankly. even though it was the middle of the day, I wouldn't have felt safe grabbing a bite to eat somewhere close by. The aquarium itself was safe, lots of families, and the surrounding beach was...somewhat safe-ish seeming, but the few streets leading up to it after the freeway were filled with homeless people. The type who scream as you drive by. I'm just saying, honestly, go there but be careful! Oh yeah, one other great thing about it is that it is completely free (suggested donations only).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KATIEPIXIEDUST
10,Watchout for the rude sercie at the information center,"I visited the Aquarium today. As I walk my bike (NOT RIDING) toward the information booth, the 1st thing that I was greeted by a nasty and mean grumpy old me. He start to yell at me that I should not have my bike with me in the patio (but there was no sign any where that bike is not allow). So I politely acknowledge. Then I ask where can I get the water or is there a store that sell the water. Then replied me with a very rude manner. Then there was a nice lady sitting next to him direct me to the water fountain near by.As I finish refill my water bottle and try to find my way out, that grumpy old me start of yell and broadcast in the intercom ""no bike in the patio get out of patio"" couple times.So, be ware when you go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarylC808
50,Amazing Quaint Aquarium,"So many areas to visit! They have a research library upstairs, large auditorium, exploration center, aquatic nursery, large exhibit hall, salt marsh, tidepools, native garden and beaches. There is a simulated rocky shore tidepool exhibit where you can touch sea urchins, sea stars, giant keyhole limpets and sea anemones! It opens for 20 minutes at a time on weekends opens at 11:30a, 12:30p, 1:30p, 2:30p, 3:30p. Weekend hours are 10am-5pm, weekdays Noon-5pm. Check out the calendar of events for special events or activities for families. Staff is nice, friendly and informative. I take my out of town family here during the holidays and for good low tides. Parking is $1 per hour cash only, no atms. I've been here for multiple college field trips because it showcases Southern California Marine Life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinicupcake
50,Great Aquarium,We took our 10 year old granddaughter here. This aquarium allows pre teens and teen to interact with the researchers. It is great opportunity to expose career possibilities.The aquarium is excellent in its own right and has a low admission cost. Either $1 or $5.Gift shop is very nice as well.A must if you are visiting Los Angeles. It is close to the Port of Call shopping area with restaurants and shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickb1312
50,had no idea how fascinating a tide pool could be,"We've been to the aquarium before and have always enjoyed the exhibits. But this time as we were about to leave we decided to check out the tide pools to the north side of the parking lot along the ocean. Lots of people just wandering on their own among the rocks. Right at our feet were octopus, squid, crabs, sea hares (YUK), snails, etc. One pool had even been colored fuchsia by either an octopus or squid's ink. We're definitely going back. Definitely a great place for all ages.The aquarium itself has no fee, but $5 donations suggested with $1 for children. Parking is $1/hr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7seekers
50,"Impressive science destination, great for families and adults alike!","Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is a facility under the umbrella of LA Parks and Rec, I was surprised to discover. When taken in that light, this ""small"" aquarium is especially impressive. In addition to their display space, they are also a working research facility (and you can tour those areas as well!) This impresses the heck out of me, in a day and age when science falls further and further from what is considered public interest.The aquarium consists of several separate-but-joined areas to tour: the nursery/research facility; the exploration center, the exhibit hall, and a research library. There is also a lovely, winding courtyard between the touring areas with additional hands-on displays (fossils to touch, statues, art, face-cutout cartoon stands for photos, etc.) A nice gift shop rounds out the offerings.The touch tank is very popular, but is only open on a cycling schedule, so be sure you check that day's schedule and work your tour around it if you want to participate. A docent gives a talk while the tank is open.The facility is focused on research and conservation relevant to the immediate coastal areas, so these are the sorts of displays you'll find in the exhibits. You'll discover this doesn't make for limited offerings, thanks to the hugely diverse ecosystems the area is home to. Just don't expect to see displays from worldwide, like a larger aquarium attraction might have. (Visit nearby Aquarium of the Pacific for a ""bigger picture"" type attraction. Much larger, takes more time to tour, and is more expensive . . . but worth it, if that's what you're looking for.) They do a good job here staffing (both volunteer and paid, I discovered) with docents available to answer any questions. The media equipment is very modern, giving large, clear views even to those who must stand further back. Hi-def microscope cameras and monitors catch the action of the tiniest critters - it really is fascinating!Parking is ample when I've visited during the off-beach season, but I suspect they are more full when the adjacent beach becomes more popular. Even so, you shouldn't have to walk far to enter the aquarium facility. Parking is free for 20 minutes (nice for pick up/drop offs) and is $1/hour up to a $9 max - a real deal in LA! Plan on at least two hours to see the whole facility - more if your group has the attention span. A nice day trip might be to see this facility for half a day, eat a picnic lunch (or buy from the burger cart vendor) on the adjacent beach, have a stroll through the lovely park, and then visit nearby Marine Mammal Care Center. Whale Watching is also available nearby, and could round out a day nicely.Be sure to check hours before you visit, they are a bit variable from day to day, and at present the facility is closed to the public on Mondays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoonOverJupiter
50,The Aquarium is Great,"I really like the Cabrillo Aquarium.It's small and easily accessable. They are doubling the size though, so it should be a lot better. While it doesn't have the pizazz of the Old Marineland or the San Diego Aquarium - In my opinion it's MUCH more interesting. They have numerous displays - that you can get to UP close. I haven't been to the Long Beach Aquarium lately, but again, I really like the educational aspects of the Cabrillo, where you get a much better picture of the seashore life. Of course, you can also visit the tide pools which are adjacent. Check their website, the Daily Breeze or San Pedro.Com's calendar for events, lectures and tours.The price is certainly right. It's FREE. They do have a donation box though and parking is $7.How much do you learn about the Ocean from watching whales jump and do tricks anyway?I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest30699
