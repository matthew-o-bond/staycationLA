40,Small but well worth a visit.,"This small museum holds a fascinating collection of neon signs and neon art. Friendly staff and clear labelling make the story of exhibits clear, and help in understanding how the signs work. My favourites were Lincoln Market and, of course, the huge dragon sign from Grauman’s Chinese Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3495UPandrewb
50,Has come a long road since inert neon discovered,"Popularly associated with advertising signs, this museum also shows another aspect, namely the art of neon lighting.Some engaging pieces are on radiant display. It was great strolling around the few rooms admiring the portrayals of imaginative creations in luminous glows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Cool experience,Small but cool experience in downtown Glendale. Plenty of food options nearby and great people watching in this area. Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MG02116
40,"Good, small museum",The museum is on the small side with a small hall for temporary exhibits and a larger room for the permanent collection. If you like neon art or nostalgia this is worth a visit. I liked the museum very much but I would not recommend driving more than one hour to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packedandready2go
50,If you like color and cool then this is your place.,The ultra cool museum of neon art located in beautiful downtown Glendale and be simply electrified by the colors and shapes that this one of a kind temple to signage can offer. Basking in the glow of our noble gas offered some amazing instagram opportunities at this revolving showcase of all things that glow in the dark. Not to be missed is the killer gift shop which really had some amazing gifts to brighten up anyone's day.Full video review on my youtube channel TravelClast,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therealserrini
10,"What a sham and disappointment, there was barely anything there! Not acceptable and not okay to charge $10.00!!","I have always been fascinated with neon and love everything neon. I own several neon pieces and everyone raves about them when they see them. I have wanted to see the ""newish"" MONA museum as the last time I visited it, it was in downtown LA, which was small, but they had some interesting neon signs.Wow!!! this is really a ripoff!!! $10.00 for NOTHING!!!...I drove over from the westside and asked if I could use the restroom before visiting the museum. The lady selling tickets told me no. Now I realize why--if I had gone past the museum to use the restroom, I'd have NEVER paid for that. She told me if I bought 10 used books outside, they would give me a discount and I had asked if I could use the restroom, then go look at the books. So, with the answer no, I paid for the entrance and went in. There is barely any NEON??? WTH? a few signs and then there was this exhibit that had nothing to do with neon and quite frankly looked like a high school art project exhibit!! boring and naff. I was so miffed and think they need to be more honest about what is actually on display--maybe 5 neon signs or less? way less than they had in their small space downtown. I do not recommend this place and I think they are doing a diservice to the public by not explaining that there is little to nothing to see and that you are paying their rent. End of. Total disappointment and I do fee they are cheating people. Not cool and not ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoleilLosAngeles
50,Surprising,"It looks small from the outside, but it was very impressive on the inside. Different signs, not just from Glendale. very good history and backround information",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesbV3248LY
30,Glow,"I enjoy discovering new things so when I came across a museum on neon art I thought YES!It’s located in Glendale with lots of restaurants and shops to enjoy. The museum itself is small, so you won’t need a lot of time to enjoy. It’s cute, the staff is eager to answer any questions, but I was disappointed on how small it was . The collection of signs were cool, I just wish they had more.Worth a visit if you don’t have a lot of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauramaldonado34
10,Save your money.,"$10 should have been a suggested donation not a required admission fee. I'd probably pay $2 if that. I do like the concept of neon art. For $10, I expected more exhibitions. It was one level and the sounds are American Horror Story creepy. No curator. Shameful!For good neon art, go to Sunset Blvd at night or any bar with neon lights, which I did later that night.Lesson learned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrK302JI
10,A Complete Waste of Time,"As someone who has long enjoyed visiting museums...the Museum of Neon Art was a huge disappointment. The museum is extremely small, and offers nothing in the way of a history or description of their neon pieces. For anyone truly interested in neon art, I would suggest that they simply walk along any large city street......where they will see a far more extensive extension of neon signs. Given the tiny size of this ""museum,"" I can't imagine anyone spending more than 5-10 minutes to go in-and-out the front door",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Longstreet7
20,FOILED,"I would LIKE to write a review and I feel sure it would be positive...IF I could have gotten in! I'm a pretty serious historic neon sign collector in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. A visit to MONA has been on my list for some time. Earlier today, I flew to L.A., a day ahead of a business meeting. In a pouring rain, I programmed my GPS to drive from West Hollywood to Glendale to see MONA. Took me and hour and fifteen minutes in stop and go traffic. I checked before leaving to be sure it was open on Friday and that I would be within the posted hours. FINALLY got there, and there was a note on the door that it was closed for the day while they worked in the back on a new exhibit. That would have been something that might helped if it was posted on the website...not on the front door. Bummed and wasted about 3 hours of intense driving!! Don't think I'll be going back...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbL1839FX
50,Neon heaven!,"We came to Glendale to shop, and literally stumbled on the Museum of Neon Art. Small but wonderful. Great examples of neon artifacts from all over SoCal, and all lit in their neon glory. If you have any interest in mid-century modern stuff, this place will delight you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3464RJjayl
50,In the Valley now. We visited MONA when it was on Olympic in L.A. A great place to visit1,"If you are a fan of neon, this is the place. The saved neon from stores, gas stations, car dealers and other locations are bright and illuminated for your pleasure. It is a step back into the early days--now most signs are plastic with bulbs behind them--nothing can compare with the beauty and craftsmanship of authentic neon. It's a great place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Westwood1der
30,OK for Neon Lovers,The tiny museum that has rotating exhibits of old as well as contemporary neon can be visited in half an hour. Some nostalgic pieces that those who grew up in the 50's through 60's will remember.A lovely patio with native plants provides a nice place to sit and relax.The $5 entry for Glendale residents is worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZuzkaE
30,Somewhat disappointed,"I was excited to see we had a museum devoted to neon as I grew up in the 50's and remember all the old neon signs. That's what I expected to see in a museum. Much to my surprise they only had a couple of the old neon signs in the lobby. The museum itself consisted of one very large room with modern art made with neon. It was rather interesting but certainly not what I expected. Hope they will bring in the ""old "" original neon art of the 40's to 60's. And by the way, many neon items were for sale if you like the modern stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inajeanb
40,Interesting and fun,"MONA is a long time LA establishment and moved a few years ago to their beautiful new home in Glendale. Their collection encompasses some of the most iconic signage art from Los Angeles's long history. It doesnt take long to see it all, but the exhibit is well done and enough information is given about each piece to make the visit very worthwhile. At certain times you can actually watch the neon creators work the tubes and fabricate the neon pieces through a window that looks into their in-house classroom and repair shop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluecarrot
30,Okay way to spend 30 minutes.,"I'd never seen a museum like this before so decided to give it a shot. It's interesting, but there's not much to see - the paid admission area is just one very large room with a few dozen neon figures in it. It's dark (by design so you can see the glow from the figures), but that also made it hard to read the signs accompanying the exhibits.The front of the museum includes the gift shop and some neon signs and there's no cost to stroll through there. You'll get a good sampling from there and I would personally skip spending the $10 to see the back room exhibits unless you have a real interest in neon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhlmkh
40,Small unique art museum,"Outside the museum there are a couple of pieces neon advertising art. That led me to expect that this would be a collection of nostalgic neon signs. The ticket seller reset my expectations. These are new artworks which have nothing to do with advertising.There is also a glassed-in workshop where (I assume) neon artworks can be made, although it was not in use while we were there.While this museum is small, it is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomrU3097LH
50,De light ful,"We found this boutique museum across the street from the Americana At Brand shops. What a delightful find it was. The gallery is one large room and holds rotating exhibits. The one we saw was the Art of Plasma and it was true to the museum's focus on art. The room was dark to allow the colorful and dynamic pieces to shine; think of the novelty plasma ball twisted and forged into artistic creations. The application of scientific principles to art makes for a unique experience not found in traditional art museums.The entry fee is comparable to other museums but given a single exhibit room, some may find it high. If you consider the unique nature of the subject matter, then the fee isn't bad. Besides, there are discounts for seniors and kids are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33GS
50,Love NEON well make sure you visit MONA,This neon museum found a permanent home in city of Glendale. Kim the Executive director has toiled for years to bring MONA to our city.Collections change so visitors never know what you may discover.Classes in how to make and execute neon offered at very reasonable prices too.They have guess demonstrating lamp work and glass related class too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henryandyolandac
50,Check it out,"We walked by and just had a few minutes until we had to meet up with friends. Enjoyed the sins outside and went in to the gift shop. The exhibits rotate and this one happened to be plasma. Since we aren't that interested in plasma and only had a short time, we didn't pay the entry fee. However, we spent ourhalf hour loving the gift shop. Lots of very cool retro things there. Bought several items for gifts and for myself I bought a very slick tiny fan lowered by my cell phone. For those of us women over 50, it is a lifesaver! Anyway the bottom line is, the giftshop is free to enter and even if you don't get to see the exhibits it's worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biblecat1
50,Neon the lost art,"I grew up in Hollywood and remember a lot of these old grand signs.Neon unfortunately has become rather extinct for many reasons. Seeing these lit up old signs brought back many childhood memories when my father would take us on drives thru our city at nite. It was fun to people watch and see the spectacular the neon signs that lined are streets.The restaurants, bars, bakeries and pharmacies seemed so glamorous and I was always so curious about how they were made. Not many to see any more. I think for nostalgia it really a wonderful exhibit. Be sure to watch the movie in the back room its very interesting. The gift shop has some really cool items and the people who run it are very welcoming. I haven't yet been able to watch the classes thru the front window but I am anxious to see how it all works. Check it out!! I believe if you are a resident of Glendale its $ 5.00 but don't take my word.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevenss
50,Truly Unique! Glad I Went.,"My boyfriend and I are huge art lovers and were looking for something different than the typical museum/gallery experience. What really makes this place is the location. Glendale is a hell of a lot more manageable than LA proper, with lots of parking. There is a beautiful shopping area not far from the museum with tons of places to grab a bite and a pretty area to walk around in.The museum, itself, is in a really interesting building. The collection that we saw (plasma work) was really unique and cool and I'd definitely go back to see any new collections. The cost is a little pricey and the museum a bit small, but I do think it's worth it for the unique experience. You don't get to see this kind of stuff often and the space is really well laid out for the type of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink
40,Really fun place to see examples of neon art,"They also do a tour on a double decker bus of neon art in LA, which is a fun evening. This is located right across from the Americana on Brand, parking all around, and at night that area has other neon signs/art to look at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
50,Wonderful small museum,"What a wonderful surprise!There we were in Glendale and wandered into this magical place.The artistic factor was a big hit, but the historical background made this a truly memorable visit. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR510b
30,Not worth the Entrance fee,The entrance fee was quite pricy for a small attraction. I expected more since this was one of the top things to do in trip advisor. But i would have to say everything is pretty to photograph.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680juliusc
50,"As a lover of neon, this is a must see","The art and science of making commercial neon is dying out as signs are being replaced by LED and other technologies. However, there is nothing like neon to capture your attention and the folks at MONA know that. They have collected an impressive array of WORKING neon signs and even have a shop on-site dedicated to allowing neon ""tube benders"" to show their skills in front of the museum-going public. Enter and exit through the ubiquitous gift shop and be prepared to be dazzled by light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsimonis
50,I never knew that there were so many kinds of neon lights,"I was traveling up Brand Blvd. when I saw this black building with a neon Marque on its roof, then I saw its sign and just had to see what could fill a whole building with neon art work.I highly recommend this to anyone what enjoys quirky things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
50,The best there is: neon lives here,NEON is no longer something from th e'olden days.' Th eNeonMuseum has captured the heart and soul of the neon signagefrom the olden days AND it also has a gift store with reasonably priced items for memories of your Neon Experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027

50,Walk down memory lane at the Museum of Neon Art,I was born and raised in Southern California. It was very cool to see some of the old neon signs I grew up with. Small and convenient museum. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209reneeh
50,Small and worth it,"My favorite was actually one of the least significant, the horse racing in the front. Now that I understand the town history, its prime influencer and developer, Leslie C. Brand, was a huge horse fan, so it's all the more fitting. It's all very cool and shows a much higher level of technology than I expected in the more historic pieces. They don't open until noon, so enjoy your morning elsewhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
30,small but fun,"This place is fun to visit but on the small size, However, if you are nearby its worth a visit. They have some large iconic neon pieces with a history blurb to explain the signage. I was there with a group which was really too large to fit into the space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
50,Awesome Neon Art,"The Neon signs are simply stunning up close and worth a good look. The museum isn't very large, but you absolutely get your money's worth, especially if you're a resident of Glendale. They also do bus tours, and it is on my list of things to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracR3443DJ
50,Best of Neon!,"If you are in Glendale, you should be spend an hour at the MONA. Great selection of neon signs, including the famous Brown Derby sign. The museum is small, but it was just enough! When you leave you will see how many places still use neon sign and it's becoming trendy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4866EJjenniferk
40,"Great old neon pieces, small exhibit","We had seen the place on earlier trips to Glendale, CA, but it was not open yet. Very interesting neon work and old signs. Some still need restoration, small exhibit hall, a bit of a disappointment from that perspective. Still happy we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650RichardC
