40,Nice Area to Walk,"I didn't actually attend an event, but I did walk for hours around the grounds which had plenty of paths surrounded by lovely landscaping. Sitting by the huge fountain was relaxing.",greekbecky2016
10,RUDE GUARD!,We visited the Convention Center to stop by the Visitor Information booth-what a disaster! A female security guard (long hair tied into 2 ponytails) accosted me and rudely asked if I had an 'event name tag'...I told her I was just trying to get tourist information but the booth was closed. She rudely told me to leave if I was not part of an event! I said I was waiting for my husband who was in the bathroom and she told me to wait outside! Just then my husband walked up and we wanted to walk the few feet to another exit to check out the Pacific Cafe-the rude woman BARKED at us to use the nearest door & exit immediately. Never been treated so poorly as a visitor to any city and such a shame Long Beach pays the salary for this rude treatment of its tourists. What's the big deal about walking thru the city's convention center anyway?,geezergal55

Beautiful inside and out, and in a great area filled with restaurants and tourist attractions.As with all convention centers, food and drinks inside are overpriced, but a short walk will take you to just about anything you could think of.",IanArnold
40,HUGE,This huge building stands out on Ocean Blvd. Inside the convention center the layout is fairly intuitive with an open feeling. The downside is the parking that is listed on the website but without a specific street address is hard to access with a navigation device and also visually difficult to find.,GlobalGypsy_13
40,Nice place,"I attended the Legon Sports Festival here to compete in and assist with the Amateur Athletic Union Olympic Lifting and Feats of Strength compitition. Had a great time with the Amateur Athletic Union as always. There were other interesting events going on as well. Lots of different sports and athletics related booths. And had a good crowd both days.The Convention center itself is well centered in Long Beach. The staff did a excellent job of keeping the place , including the bathrooms clean while I was there. Loading and unloading was convenient. There was food at the event but you would be better served going upstairs to the restaurant there which served us a good lunch. Plenty of parking for fifteen dollars a day.Although a good experience and a excellent staff. Will be happy to return.",Mikel M

40,Midsummer scream,Went to this event April 3rd. Would have given this event of five if it wasn't for the Hall of Shadows mazes. People were going in coming out almost as quickly as they entered they were waiting 45 minutes to an hour in line for the Maze and they had nothing inside them they lasted for approximately half a minute into a full minute. Out in the main body of the event where the vendors were that was an absolute five. The vendors were knowledgeable there was plenty I mean plenty of things to look at. My wife came home with several ideas for this year's Halloween in our front yard.,Craig B

40,No water fountain tho?,"The facility itself was kept nice, although the elevator from the parking lot smelled like urine.... My one beef with this place was that there was no water fountain to be found. I even asked the staff and they couldn't tell me. They do have concession stand there, so technically, you could buy the beverage, but I feel that there should be an option should one decide not to spend a fortune on little bottled water.",Satoka E

40,Completely Changed from years ago!,"We had a conference to attend and specifically did not stay in this area as we understood years ago how bad it was. Well, Well, Well....much to our surprise... we wish we had stayed in this area. There were many shops in the area and the Aquarium of the Pacific was fabulous!! You can pick up a whale watching tour from this area or a tour of the harbor. You can also catch a free red bus ride to tour the Queen Mary. I felt this area was safe and had many things to do while at a conference. Any of the hotels in that area seemed suitable but the Hyatt was really the place to stay. There is a PF Changs, Outback, Hooters, Bubba Gumps and many other restaurant options in the area. There is also a Laugh Factory which seems a lot of fun!",Pam1775
40,Great Facilities,"Attended a conference there as an exhibitor, and really enjoyed the layout and atmosphere. The staff members were all really helpful and friendly.

30,Food Show Business Trip,"Over the course of my stay I ate here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I would definitely eat here again for lunch or dinner, but breakfast was overpriced. I had eggs, bacon, and coffee for breakfast and mine was free cause I was staying at the hotel and a Diamond Member. However, my colleagues cost $30 a person (included tip/tax) for the same meal. Lunch I had seafood enchiladas, which were amazing! Then for dinner I had ribeye steak, broccoli, and potatoes which were also excellent.

10,Horrible venue for business events,"I attended an expo sponsored by my company. I have been to a number of convention centers: LA, Anaheim, Vegas, Reno. The LBC Ctr is the worst I have been to.First of all, there is no coffee onsite. You have to walk across the street, or walk to the adjacent Hyatt Regency to obtain coffee.Secondarily, the equipment is dated. The skirt covering the panelists table was teal: Teal?! What is this the 90's?! In addition, there was no wireless mic to allow questions in the audience to be asked so everyone can hear. Likewise, there were only two mics and there were three panelists. Lastly, the restroom had a dated soap dispenser that was loose.Thirdly, the food was bad. I could only attend one day of the expo ($165), and we were given a box lunch and had to get our own water from a dispenser. There is no coffee shop or snack bar to obtain other drinks.The LBC Ctr is the lamest set up I have ever seen. Its very surprising bc the outside and entrance area looks shiny and new.",KeoPAloha

40,Nice Space & Staff,"Staff were extrememly pleasant and helpful. Exhibit space and conference rooms were easy to navigate. However, I did find the elevator/floor numbering ackward, 3rd floor elevator has conference rooms numbered as 200s. Ramps are at each end of the building, which if you use the evelator to avoid the initial steps going in is in the center.I liked there was food available in the center for a quick lunch, both salads, sandwiches, flat breads.After navigating the Pine Ave hill up and down for several days (using cane due to disc issue), I learned from the doorman at the Hyatt that there is promenade from the Marriott to the center that is a straight shot.

30,mmmm....Conference food,"I've been to numerous conferences in Australia and the food has always been pretty good, so I was looking forward to the equivalent in the US.To be honest, the size of the conference is big, so I appreciate that providing food for a couple of thousand people is hard. Breakfasts were a burrito (day 1), a turkey and cheese muffin (day 2) and french toast (day 3), with juice, fruit and muffins on the side. Coffee and tea, although no fresh milk for either...only the little pods.Lunch on day 1 was nice (chicken), day 2 not so nice (rice and beef), and day 3 yummy (table service at the Jane Fonda session).The cocktail session was okay, although terribly slow service. Why not have open wine bottles and let people serve themselves rather than having to line up for 10 minutes for a super tiny drink?",malomax

40,"Great venue for conference, not a tourist attraction",We had a great conference here. There are several restaurants and shops in very easy walking distance so that makes breaks nice.

20,Poorly Managed,"While attending a convention, we felt both the attendees as well as the vendors suffered for having chosen this venue. This conference was supposed to start at 10am but attendees were forced to enter single file in line. Some didn't get I used till 11am. I'm not sure if it was the convention sponsors idea or the center but the center shouldn't allow it for the sake of their reputation.Inside , raffle ticket drums caused yet another bottleneck! Not well coordinated or thought out.Many vendors could not get a wifi signal and therefore couldn't process sales therefore could make many!For a Saturday-Sunday ONLY convention, the venue simply CAN NOT run out of food for lunch a 12:30pm on Saturday! At 12:30pm on the first day, they ran out of hamburgers and one of two salads, forcing people to wait 25-45 min for a burger!!! They were missing the seminars they paid to see or not able to eat! Those giving the seminars lost audience due to their need to eat. Again, there WERE only FOUR ITEMS on the menu, a burger or chicken sandwich and two salads (Greek or wedge). STAFF EVERYWHERE but no food. Staff simply told customers they weren't in charge of cooking... ridiculous!Sunday a CLOSED sign was place on the ladies restroom outside the conference. No sign to an alternative restroom, nothing.This venue is old enough to have such details ironed out!",FromOurManagement

Or meet & greet with the Disney characters. It is too dark to take pictures with them inside the arena. It will be nice if at the end of the show, they can turn on all the lights and all the characters standing inside the rink and audience can take selfie with them. That is what parents want... pictures of the happy memory for their kids!!Many booths selling merchandise and food & beverages. There is also a photo booth picture with Frozen characters.

40,Good food,"First Conference center ice been to in a while with healthy food: sandwiches served with grapes, gourmet salads. Thank-you for not serving hamburgers and hotdogs like everywhere else!Also clean building and BEAUTIFUL bathrooms.Building is very cold though...bring a coat!",Kelly M
30,"Better than some, not as good as others","Slightly tired convention center, dirty bathrooms, broken fountains, outrageous food prices, better than average staff in terms of helpfulness. Loading in and out as an exhibitor is as bad as any, loading docs are halfway blocked with building maintenance equipment, on an angle that made loading trucks in the rain a little dangerous. Took us 2 hours to get out having had a 10 x 10 booth.",Nils M
50,Great Place for a large convention,"ASNT arranged for its 75th year annual conference and exhibition at this convention centreExcellent roomsAdjacent to the Hyatt which made it convenient to attend for several visitors from out of townGood secrurity arrangementsSeveral eating places all around and also several hotels, motels and Inns located within close proximity",Scalfern57
10,Excessive Parking Charges,This was very disappointing situation their lack of technology and extremely poor customer service requires cash for parking one day credit card the next claiming that their credit card devices are working. This is the year 2016 technology is robust.It's an extreme hassle to be forced to go to an ATM get cash and come back to the garage then get to our booth on time.Very bad service. I won't come back,Sharon S
40,Great location for our Convention,This convention center is good because there are wonderful hotels within walking distance to the center. The staff are very friendly. The biz rooms can be very cold so make sure you bring an extra shawl or sweater- brrrr.,Rita T
30,Conference at the LB Convention,First time at the convention for a conference.... it's a really large venue and it's a lot of walking. There is construction going on and some locations are closed off. It's hard to locate the elevators over in the breakout rooms and with this injured knee it's pretty painful. The attendants are nice and friendly.,Yessenia31
40,Conference,"We visited the convention center for the NACO Conference in July. A job well done by the staff in accommodating such a large group. The facilities were spot on and everything went well, with a great floor plan and hospitable staff that provided the traffic control to the different meeting rooms.",Jim A
40,Great conference venue,"I have just spent 4 days at a conference there. The facilities are very good and well located to several hotels that surround it. I found it to physically be one of the best facilities I have visited related to size, layout, design and function. We did have some minor issues with staff; however, I would chalk that up to sheer size of the convention and the probability something will go wrong. They worked hard to correct it. Overall great facilities in a beautiful setting. As a bonus, there is a feature outside the center that is no listed as an attraction. The Loop at Ocean and Pine is a cool piece of public art that adds to the center, like the arena being painted like an ocean scene.",Grover R
50,Event location,"Smaller than Anaheim or Dusseldorf's Messe, the LBCC overlooks no detail and is a worthy venue for large trade shows.",VictoriaTravelsToo
40,Gymnastics Nationals,The convention center is easy to navigate and has many restaurants close by. It was clean and well organized for our activity.,Stephanie G
40,Scuba,"went for the scuba convention its great because it has enough space to accommodate all the vendors . And it is also close to many eateries, shops and especially the beach. If you have never been to the aquarium. But overall the convention center is a big area for big events",ShaeMyles
50,Nice Location,"Having attended/worked several conventions here, I am pretty familiar with the center! It is centrally located, surrounded by all the amenities you might need!",lehook1031
50,Great Location easy in and out!!!,I work in the tradeshow industry and love working at the LBCC. There is always something happening and there's new shopping right across the street and tons of restaurants to chose from. We love Islands and a little bit further are restaurants right on the marina and shoreline village.,kayzzze2016
20,Bathroom issues,Came for an event. There is a small parking garage and large parking lot which both connect. The inside had a restaurant a a few small concessions. The main area was nice because of the 360 seating. No matter where you say you are able to have a good view. We couldn't believe the few bathrooms that were available. Super long lines for the ladies bathroom. The had many portable toilets outside but only a few were open. 2 stars given because of this,John J
40,Went for an Herbalife conference,"I was with 13,000+ of my closest friends at a conference here. It was a beautiful arena, great signage, awesome location, but the bathrooms were few and far between. The lines were crazy long and to have only a few bathroom options seemed unacceptable.",Jcburlew5
20,"Arena needs an overhaul, conference fine",YMCA gymnastics nationals competition held in area. For spectators the seating is the worst. What a crap-hole. Bathrooms were not supplied well with paper product & the couch/benches in the women's rooms are disgusting. Concessions employees were ridiculously slow. Don't think I can blame anything else on the convention center. I'm sure someone else was to blame for the food issues. Glad I only had to be there for one day.,TroyAndCarrie
30,"Large hall, but lots of walking","The Long Beach Convention Center is very large, so be prepared for lots of walking. The bathrooms are a bit hidden, too. The staff was friendly.",Seiderjps
40,Beautiful convention center,Beautiful convention center right next to our hotel. There is a man made water pond that displays water shows. Building in itself is also nice to look at.,daikin
30,Average space but close to many other attractions,"I do not know the age of the center but it looks like it is dated. You are able to get to the different rooms easily and there is a deli/coffee shop inside. It is close to the Hyatt and the waterfront and shops so if you have a break, it is a short walk to restaurants and attractions.",FamilyontheMove_12
40,Beautiful at night for a nice stroll,"There are lots of lights, trees, various colors, and with a moonlit night, the color extends into the sky. Add some color from other local buildings and across the water, including the bridge, and this is a beautiful place for an evening walk.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
40,Long Beach Convention Center,"We just had a booth as an exhibitor at the Long Beach Scuba Show. We've done this show many times, and this year was probably the best yet - lots of enthusiastic divers looking for a destination. The convention center is very user-friendly, with one exception. Another group using a different hall had somehow gotten exclusive use of the parking lots at the center. Not sure how or why. Even as a vendor trying to get near the entrance with heavy gear, they told me ""you can go park in the grass, over there somewhere"". Even they didn't know or care where they were trying to send me. They said ""the Scuba Show doesn't pay for parking"". But the truth is, each car pays for parking, and I was ready and willing to pay. I hope in the future, the Convention center doesn't allow one group a monopoly on the parking. It could certainly affect the attendance at the other events.",Jeff L
40,Very big and spacious with killer views,"Located right near the waterfront, with lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance and with plenty of parking, this convention center is very user friendly. The inside is nice, very light and airy and easy to get around.",Sam S
50,Impressive,"Modern facilities in an historic building. Excellent location near the long beach waterfront. Beautifully bright on sunny days allowing the rays of the sun in over most of the expansive common area. The ballroom is particularly impressive although this can be said about everything here. Love the decor, the light fixtures, and framed artwork.",Amin A
40,Pleasant enough,"This is really your typical waterside convention center. It is not as maze-like as many and has a clean, open feel to it overall. Quite serviceable for small to medium gatherings",Michael V
40,Great conference facility.,I attended an international Fire Chiefs' conference at this facility. The Hyatt Regency was the host hotel for the conference and is conveniently located right next door. The facility is modern and comfortable and the staff is helpful and very accommodating.,Andy M

50,A great place for a convention.,"I was pleased with the convention center. They had tourism info available, snack place, and the food during the conference was actually very good. Design was nice and the break out rooms were easily located throughout the building. I also liked the surrounding shops, hotels, waterfront.",Teresa C
50,One of the most convenient and unique convention centers is all of California,"This convention center is an absolutely great place for a conference of meeting. Situated on the waterfront withiin walking distance of a myriad of restaurants, an aquarium, and convention outlet mall shopping. Furthermore transportation within the downtown is free using the downtown shuttle. No real need to rent a car with transportation from the nearby Long Beach Airport very affordable....and nowhere in America can you beat the weather in Long Beach!",Les R
50,Great Place for Shows and Conventions,This a very modern and spotless convention center that is laid out very well with plenty of seating in the halls when you are worn out. I like this place much better than the LA or Anaheim Centers.,PatrickLongBeach

40,An Expansive Multipurpose Arts Center,"Long Beach Performing Arts Center is an expansive multipurpose complex - including an arena, two theaters, ballrooms, exhibit halls, meeting rooms and access to The Convention Center: And a fabulous fountain feature fronting Ocean Avenue.The Terrace Theater is a full production theater with seating shaped in a comfortable continental style while The Center Theater Is more intimate. It is beautifully decorated and offers visibility from any seat.While The Long Beach Arena can be utilized for events such as exhibits, concerts, and sporting events-including ice events; our very own Ice Dogs, a professional ice hockey team played until the end of the 2006-2007 East Coast Hockey League ( ECHL ) season. At the time the team folded, it was the ECHL affiliate of the Boston Bruins of the NHL.The Pacific Room is in the Long Beach Arena - is hip in-that-it brings together sight, sound, and space.These Long Beach facilities are also used as garage space for the Champ Car Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach every April.",TGDino
50,"Go to a LB Symphony concert, you will be glad you did","Outstanding venue, great acoustics, ambiance OK. Those big screens help, and we were glad to see maybe 75% of the orchestra members were women seniors, glad they keep going.

30,Typical Center. Friendly Staff,"The Long Beach Convention Center is a typical conference center in an above average destination. The space is large and comfortable, the amenities are pretty standard and the food is woefully average (think pizza, burgers, etc.). What stands out here is the friendliness of the on-site staff (for the most part) and the convenience to downtown Long Beach and its cute (if commercial) Pike area with newish outlet shops and eateries. Truthfully, the convention center in Anaheim is far superior in terms of facilities but the Anaheim area (which I've often said is where fun goes to die) can't even come to close to comparing with Long Beach. I'd pick this convention center for that reason alone every time.",mere13
40,Good Sized Convention Center,It's a good choice for expos and the cost of parking is about $10 which is average for Long Beach. It's really large too so be prepared to get a good walk in on the day that you go. I've only been here for travel expos but would like to check out more expos if they are offered here.,Tamara V
30,LB Convention center was ok.,A little dated on the arena side of things. The pine avenue side is more updated. Not any great quick meals.,DougTMesa
40,Gymnastics Competition,Attended a gymnastics competition there this weekend. Overall the facility was nice. It is very large though and there was no signage or staff to ask directions. Took awhile to find the right location and really feel like signage would help attendees.,Cheryl
50,Spacious,Great for educational and business conventions. Main room is gigantic an additional rooms are well equipped.,Cleo A
50,International Ag Show,"Attended the IA (International AG) show at the Long Beach Convention Center and I will say one of the better places I have attended a show at. Liked the restaurants within walking distance, also the Long Beach Aquarium and marina, and who doesn't like Cali weather when you are used to snow this time of year.",O8659NRjohnd
30,Nice But Have Been To Better,Nice modern look but was disappointed by the lack of staff that was present or was not present. Been to a lot of convention places and this is about middle of the road,MOONSTARS M
40,Excellent venue and location for any type of event,"My wife and I have been here numerous times, we have booths at various trade shows held at the Long Beach Convention Center. It is close to a whole row of restaurants within walking distance and of course, we have the Queen Mary, beaches, Seaside Village, Lighthouse, beautiful paths to walk and ride bikes. Unfortunately some of the shows are not held here anymore, I am wishing they would come back to use this facility again. It is well kept, clean, classy and practical, and there are plenty of parking garages nearby as well as street parking.",roydio1948
40,Great Convention Location,"Came for the ASCP convention. Just next to the Hyatt Regency and across from the Pike. 2 stories of conference rooms with a small food court on the first level. Stairs, elevator and escalator make it accessible for all. Very nice facility close to all the Long Beach attractions. Would return for another conference.",suefromCalif
40,Annual meeting,This is a nice convention center. It is right next to the Hyatt and within a short walking distance to other hotels. There are numerous restaurants and night life establishments across the street.,John D
40,Its a convention center...,"Not sure what else to say but it does have some nice interactive displays with maps to help find your way. The various exhibit and room areas are pretty spread out so it can be confusing. The place is in good shape, there are plenty of areas to sit and chat with people outside the rooms/exhibit areas and even some nooks with plugs/recharge receptacles for devices. Parking is close by, but pricey; and plenty of eating options in walking distance.",Kelly E
40,Great conference venue,Attended a conference at the venue and it measured up to international standards. Great view and food,Joe O
40,A mid-sized but full-service convention center in a very accessible location,"Have come here for a number of conventions, both education and travel-oriented and enjoyed all of them. Parking's not unlimited but you won't spend an hour looking for your car either. Surrounded by fine hotels and walking distance from the New Pike and Rainbow Lagoon, a highly pleasurable place to attend a conference.",wmteweles
50,Easy to navigate!,I attended a conference here in Long Beach in October. The problem with many convention centers are that they are very large and difficult to navigate around. This conference center was nicely organized and easy to find the rooms I needed to be in. The rooms were clean and spacious and the temperature was controlled nicely. There were a variety of room sizes to meet any need.,Marge B
40,Pretty Convention Center,Nice and open space and love the free following walkway just outside. Nice to enjoy some California Rays while having a conference.,SCJFL

40,Very good Convention Centre,"Nicely kept, clean facility. Sometimes concessions were unavailable but when they were, they were good. Everything worked well, including WiFi and parking, which is a nightmare in a lot of the State",Serious_Neatfreak
50,Proximity to Downtown Long Beach,"The Convention Center is all about proximity to just about everything. With the exception of the Queen Mary and Cruise Terminal, the LBCC is centrally located and within walking distance to just about everything. NOT to be confused with The Aquarium of the Pacific. Due to its circular shaped structure and mural of the Wyland Whaling Wall painted on the exterior, people often confuse it for an aquarium. By far, one of the the most logical and strategically situated locations for a convention. Great weather, beach and ocean view. Gateway to Catalina Island. Long Beach Grand Prix in April is spectacular. Grand Prix race cars at 150mph zip thru downtown LB. Pretty amazing site.",Eric B
40,Great venue,"The E Hula Mau competition was held at the convention center. There's really not a bad seat in the house.If you're performing, the stage and back-stage area are well maintained.",akra_meesh
40,Location and size,"I went for Perform Better in August/2015. It has a good size, many rooms, it's right at the main point of the city, a lot of restaurants nearby. No cleaning problems. But the biggest ballroom doesn't fit more than 400 people I believe.",EstelaAltoe

40,Great location for conventions,"The LBCC is huge. We were here for a dance convention. Plenty of room in the ballrooms except it was so cold in some rooms. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The indoor food stands had good fresh food but a bit pricey. It was nice when food trucks were outside for some variety. A number of restaurants are also within walking distance. The convention center itself is very clean, bathrooms are well maintained, adequate seating and tables and some charging areas for electronics. Plenty of underground parking too. The theatres on the other side of the convention center are also well kept with good seating plans to view the stage. Easy to get to using the free Passport bus as there were stops right outside the LBCC.",DinaMBS

10,Restroom Lockout,"I attended Trident University graduation. Love the design of this facilities. Great location. I do have a concern with, either the facility or those that rent the facility. There seem to be a real big misunderstanding that restrooms for such a large group are a MUST. The staff working the event sent people to another hotel, across the street or just turn people away when ask to use the restrooms. This should be in the contract. What a let down.",CaliforniaWellness

30,Nice interior; nightmare to get around,"I just attended a conference here. The meeting rooms were nice but the exhibition hall was a big of a hole...shabby, poorly kept and the bathrooms were dirty. The main problem was not having any idea of where to go. There was no signage and no directions and lots of other groups holding functions in the same space. Once I was coming back from an evening lecture and we walked in one set of doors to get through to the other side of the center and we couldn't find another set of unlocked doors. I had to go find security who gave me a lecture saying ""this is not the way"" over and over again. Not very helpful.",qallisong
50,Great conference site,"The convention center is located next to many fine hotels, restaurants and close to the Waterfront. The room were spacious and clean. The onsite food and beverages were expensive. The coordination of our keynote speakers was fantastic. The multimedia presentation shined in the center's ballroom.",Jason L
30,Long Beach Convention,The Long Beach Convention Center is a basic convention center. The staff is great and very helpful. The location is convenient for hotels and restaurants. There are multiple loading docks so loading and unloading were efficient. If you are looking to have a convention in the greater LA area then this is a good spot in a safe neighborhood.,jeralbre

30,NRF conference at Long Beach,Not sure what you can say good or bad about a convention center - really comes down to whose show it is. Recently attended the NRF show and between both parties everything went smoothly. Plenty of room for the expo plus all the numerous breakout meetings. Nice outside area for the drinks receptions - but it was hot!!!,Gus S

30,Nice Venue - Good Location,"We recently had a nursing convention here. It's certainly a nice place to have a convention. The rooms are comfortable and there is lots of space. The location is great because it's close to plenty of shopping and restaurants. There's a Starbucks as well as an additional coffee shop/cafe. My biggest complaint is that there is no complimentary Wi-Fi. As a matter of fact, the Wi-Fi is a ridiculous amount of money. With a 5 day conference, it's insane to ask us to pay $80 to connect to their Wi-Fi. Our conference has a great app that we could use but it did no good because most didn't want to connect to the expensive Wi-Fi.",KendraDawnRN

40,Great location for any tradeshow or conference you are having!,"This is were my convention has been held at for YEARS! and I absolutely love all the recent remodeling they have done in the past couple of years. Believe me if you are an exhibitor and have been doing tradeshows here, you have noticed the difference. From the bathrooms, to the carpet to the meeting rooms to the ARENA which received the biggest renovation. All I can say is YES!!!!! I do hope the roof of the convention center is next on their list. We haven't had a ""flooding"" due to rain in awhile LOL which is a good thing or an exhibitor say ""it is raining in my booth"" which is even better. But still, just in case, I do hope that is next on the list!",Misscutie75

Should have better parking or access to parking. There is only 1 lane that goes into the parking structures.

If going to an event there, get there early.",mooki x

20,Bathroom shortage,"This conference center looks really nice from the outside. Upon entering, you'll find a little cart cafe with seating on the first floor. The bathroom nearby the coffee and food? Six stalls in the women's. Really? So, you have thousands of people coming for a conference, you offer them food and endless coffee and the closest bathroom has only six stalls? That is some poor planning. There are other bathrooms, all with six stalls, so there are other options. I was just shocked at the one by the food was so small.I'm not sure if this was just apparent at the conference I attended or whether this is a function of the convention center itself but I felt like the badge checking people were particularly aggressive. They were rude, unfriendly and quite demanding even when your badge was pretty apparent. The box lunch provided at this facility was quite a bit worse than I have had other places. There were no gluten-free options and one vegetarian. There was also only water to drink, no soda or anything. There was supposed to be breakfast at the conference I attended but I think they cleaned it up within 20 minutes because I never saw any. And when they say 15 minute coffee break, seriously, the free coffee will only be out for 15 minutes maximum and then was cleaned up by employees.The rooms were a nice size and comfortable and it was easy to get around so those things were a plus.",lrice422
40,Conference,"The convention center is huge and comfortable. In all the sessions I attended, there were no problems with noise from other sessions 'bleeding' through the walls. Concessions were pricey but offered a good variety of food. If you're a diet coke fanatic, bring your own.",4teens
50,Excellent Location,"We attended a travel expo at the LB convention center. We stayed at the Renaissance Inn which was fab, and right across the street. The hotel has the closest Star Bucks if you need a fix.There are lots of eating establishments within walking distance, and they do allow you to bring your own food. We did not know this fact, so we ended up standing in the long for sub-par food, that was over priced. Hubby did say that the burger and fries were good. I am a vegetarian and they did offer a veggie burger that I did not purchase. I advise that you bring in your own, or go out if you can for lunch across the street at California Pizza kitchen.The center is large clean, and we enjoyed very much attending the Expo in this location.",Travelwithnise

30,The Nutcracker,This review is for the play The Nutcracker not the Theater. The play was average at best. The dancers were very weak and not trained enough to show professionalism and higher skills. The dances were mediocre but at least the costumes were beautiful. There is a live horse on the play which is probably the highlight of the night.,Therealtrue

50,Was Here For Convention.,The large meeting halls have good access and ample seating. The venue was great and so was the service there. Our event should have provided better maps so we could get there without wandering all over hell's half acre. This is a nice building for a conference. There are many nice sized rooms and lots of poster rooms downstairs. I was also pleased with the staff.,Halfmac

50,Great!,Loved this venue! Plenty of parking and very scenic. We used a smaller auditorium with plush theatre seating which was very nice. Beautiful area and lots of restaurants in the Pike area.,Sharon
40,Great location,"This place held my companies Convention and was laid out nicely, but there was a problem with bathrooms. There are not enough of them!! I felt bad for the ladies, but then they only gave us guys one bathroom to use in the whole place. Not a good situation. I don't know how this place ever got permitted with so few bathrooms!!! We had over 14,000 people there. Not enough bathrooms!",Mark N
50,Remodeled and spacious,"In addition to working here in the past as CVB concierge, I've attended many events. From Cirque du Soleil, to the annual ISSE Show, Latina beauty show (I'm also a licensed cosmetologist), Toyota Grand Prix expo, ASR show (early 90s), LB Marathon expo...The convention center has lots of brochures and magazines for visitors to take. Don't be shy about grabbing a visitor magazine as it can help you figure out what you want to do while in LB. When there are big conventions, the concierge staff in the booth can assist with dinner reservations and recommend what type of cuisine you're looking for. They are also knowledgeable about the history of Long Beach and art-deco buildings nearby.",XConciergeLB
30,Average Convention Center,"This is a very average convention center in the middle of a really boring part of SoCal. I have no idea why the Convention I had to attend would choose Long Beach, unless it was cheap. The convention center was fine, little fanfare and nothing special, but nothing bad either. The bad part is having to spend a week in Long Beach when there are hundreds of other cities we could have been in.",wilbur24795
50,Convenient and STATE OF THE ART,"Lots and lots of space abounds. The best part is the amazing new capabilities of the Arena. If you have a good sized conference coming up, do let the Convention Representative show you how they can transform this space from a hockey arena to a classy and intimate hall for formal celebrations.",MBiblis
50,LifeVantage Elite Academy,"The Convention Center is beautiful and very centrally located. Had a great time!!! We were able to walk to the restaurants we wanted, walk along the pond outside and had spectacular views of the harbor.",alaskanannie
40,"Decent space, would have liked to see more of it.",Attended the recent Long Beach Comic Con. The space used was essentially one of the large rooms in the lower area of the center and of good size for the event.Easy walking and seemed to be enough parking either on site or near by.Not much in the way of food or refreshments on site (Starbucks and some Center run catering) but across the street are a number of decent resturants at the Pike and up the road into the main part of downtown.,Rob C
40,Very impressed,"Of the major Southern California convention centers I've had the experience of working at: Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Anaheim, Long Beach was a treat. Colorful and well-maintained, it was a joy to work at. The city of Long Beach is very nice, too. Hope to return.",Kay O
40,Good Convention Center at the Harbor,Easy walking distance from hotels. Parking is a bit tricky but walking or taking a shuttle is easy. Nice areas to visit around the Convention Center.,Thomas S
40,Picturesque convention centre,Nice meeting rooms but lots of walking. Beautiful views from the promenade. There is a distance between the convention centre and the arena for large events and can be confusing to find your way around. Better signs are needed. But centre is very clean and food concessions are good and handy,Amey L
50,Beautiful and convenient!,"The lobby area was beautiful, with plenty of coffee and delicious fast food. The restaurant Bogart was very efficient and conveniently located, with few, but delicious, selections. The main arena area was very comfortable and was easily entered without long lines.",CarolNJID

I found the accommodations truly help make this a life time gor me and my family. Thr locstion is close to the train s , where several of our families whee able to connet with us.

40,Nice location for our annual conference,Attended our annual conference and this is located near waterfront in an area that has a number of restaurants and some shops. Easy access and nice views. the Hyatt is adjacent. We stayed a few blocks away and was easy walking distance. Facility was clean and well-staffed.,bills83au

40,"A Bit Small, But Good Location","My first time at this convention center. It was nice with lots of light. There were very good hotels and restaurants within easy walking distance. Major lack of choices of places to eat or drink at the convention center. I was there for the three day World Tea Expo. On the last day, worlds collided between tea lovers and Comic Con. It was amusing.",jrskk
50,Tea Expo,There are multiple entrances for this facility. It would be helpful to be marked better.The facility itself is clean and conveniently located.,SMJ46
50,Great Event Venue,"Attended the World Tea Expo there May 2014. First time there. Great venue. A block from the beach and Queen Mary. Very airy lobby area, close by to excellent restaurants.

40,Adventure Travel Show,"I attended the L.A. Adventure Travel Show at the Long Beach Convention Center. Great show and well worth the visit for anyone planning vacation travel. Adventure doesn't have to mean strenuous or dangerous - just different from what you normally do. You'll love this show with lots of speakers, cultural entertainment and opportunities to taste a few exotic dishes.",Robert P
40,Nice Manageable Place for a Con,"After the hell that is San Diego Comic Con, the Long Beach Con, at the much smaller and more manageable Convention Center, seems like hanging out with friends. Good facilities, easy to reach rest rooms, convenient parking and restaurants within walking distance. And they don't gouge you on the food inside the exhibition rooms.",Brian H
40,"Nice facility, Dress warmly, cold inside","I came here recently for the Travel and Adventure convention on Feb 8. It is a nice facility inside. I had a good time here, talking with the vendors, and getting some good ideas for my next vacation! I saw two presentations, Rick Steves, and Samantha Brown. Steve was ok, but Samantha is awesome! She really had a great personality, and a good speaker, with many funny tales to tell from her shows, and her adventures. The only downside, is that it was freezing cold, sitting for the speakers. It was like they really crank up the ac, you can fell the cold air coming down from the vents. Next time, I will look up, and try to find a seat, the is not near any of the overhead vents. Also, on a side note, as this was my first time here, I did not see any signs from the paid ($10) parking lot to the main entrance. We just followed other people, and eventually found the main entrance. Overall, I would attend the next Travel Convention here.",flyboymlc
30,NOT PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED FRIENDLY,"We went to the Long Beach Convention Center for a travel show. I must say that having Handicapped parking almost 1/2 mile from the door is horrible. Further, handicapped patrons were required to climb up and down stairs in the parking structure and at the entrance. There was poor, faded signage that, if you saw it, directed challenged patrons to a small elevator just below the main entrance.The show was very crowded. The aisles were narrow and cluttered with displays.",Chuck8700
40,Always nice,"Nice and clean, helpful people. There is plenty of options for food and drink nearby and parking is close. The place seems clean. The inside food venues are expensive but only average, that's what you have to expect I guess.",TRGarcia
50,Motorcyle Show,Excellent parking and close to the event. Everything was clean and the people that worked there were very friendly.,William F
50,A busy center,"Usually, you have 3 - 5 conventions going on here at any given weekend. Long Beach has one of the most convenient convention centers around. Its got direct metro access from Los Angeles. A number of shops and restaurants around for your dining pleasure (although some are of average quality and in a run down or declining area). Its also proximal to the Harbour. Parking is convenient and the venue attracts some big time conventions. Attached to the very dated Hyatt (see review) but non the less, a beautiful center",SonicSpringBok
50,Joyce Meyer convention,"The Convention Center was choc-full of happy people and the whole environment, in that regard, was great. It seems I waited in unnecessarily long lines for a cup of coffee then a pretzel the next day, and the line for the bathrooms was out the door, even though they opened up the men's facilities cuz most attendees were women. That said tho, I don't know the set up of the convention center and/or if more workers were available to help w/ the concession stand(s). Joyce's staff - the people selling her books and stuff in the dedicated area - seemed to be much smoother and faster at getting me through the purchasing process.",Mary Kay W
40,Long Beach Arena,"Went to hear Joyce Meyer speak. Over all a good experience. Parking was good. The arena seating is so that everyone can see the stage, the chairs were ok comfortable but tight together. The only not good thing was the ""house lights"" were on the whole time, kind of blinding.",CaliforniaCattygirl
50,A great place for a concert!,"I attended ""The Monkees"" Concert here on Tuesday, August 12th. I go to a lot of concerts but this was the first time at Long Beach Convention Center. The location was great! The center is near the ocean, with a wide variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Parking was easy to find and I was able to park on-site for $10.00. Once we walked in to attend the concert, the auditorium was well designed and the staff was very professional. I will definitely attend concerts at this location whenever I can. This is one of the best venues in Southern California!",Brenda L

The Center has beautiful common areas, great breakfast and lunch selections, attentive staff and comfortable large and small meeting rooms. The Exhibit Hall is very large and easy to maneuver. Some of the rooms did get too hot in the afternoon, but then again there were up to 300 people in the room. Overall, a terffic venue for a large conference.",Darrell D
50,great wheelchair venue,"We attended 3 days of meetings at the Long Beach Arena. We found the walk to and from the Renaissance hotel to be pleasant and the elevators worked well for getting us to the ground level, and when we went to nearby restaurants and shops there were elevators there that made the wheelchair experience very doable.",willh2o
40,E3 convention....,"Attended the E3 convention. This place is massive! I am not sure that we covered all of it! Parking was simple which is not always the case with convention centers. The Food Trucks are usually something I avoid, but the smells made my stomach growl. I had one of the best gyro plate that I have ever eaten!",Susan B

40,Very Big but well organized,"We went to our first Scuba Show this year and had a great time. Amazing how Long Beach has changed in the last 20-25 years! The show was layed-out well, the staff was helpful, and everything you needed was available (restrooms, food and drinks)My only complaint was as we walked from our hotel, the only sign for the scuba show was pointing to some stairs that led to a parking garage, and we finally ended up in a Herbalife convention... The person who finally gave us directions to the Scuba Show sent us the long way around the building... A few well placed signs geared for first timers and walkers from the main street would have saved us some time... It's a big place!Once there we had a blast!",beachfeetSoCal
40,"Nice facilities, good parking for conventions","We attended the 2013 Scuba Show at the Long Beach Convention Center in downtown Long Beach, right on the waterfront, and we had a great time.The Convention Center is very spacious and well kept up. Facilities are bright and pretty well marked. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Restrooms were plentiful and very clean. Our particular convention was very well organized, and parking was conveniently located underground directly next door to the Convention Center, so it was easy to park and simply walk across the street into the center for our show.We've actually attended two large conventions at Long Beach Convention Center in the past and we always look forward to coming here. This is a great venue for large or small events.",DiveMoreWorkLess
50,Grand Prix and more,"Attended my 3rd Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. Both the Arena and Convention Center were open for business (big business) with lots of vendors, activities, shops and food. It was wonderful to stay indoors and air conditioned on a VERY hot Friday...a great facility...too bad the Ice Dogs aren't around...",elliotts321
50,"Bright, airy, and well designed!",Our convention lasted three days! The venue was good! The sound and lighting were never an issue! There were lines at the ladies restrooms but that is the case everywhere. The food vendors didn't seem to be very efficient but they were slammed with lines at every break. The food quality was good but the wait too long. This is a nice facility overall!,Suzanne R

40,Excellent facility in the heart of Long Beach,"The convention center is well thought out, located near a number of restaurants and walking distance to half a dozen good hotels. Parking is $10, a reasonable price given the area, though the ""no in-and-out"" is a small problem.",TahoeMark
50,Impressive facilities,"I was very impressed with the convention center. I was here for a weeklong conference and the facilities were amazing. The exhibit hall was huge - they were giving out free popcorn at one end!The rooms were a nice size and comfortable to give a presentation in. The facilities were very nice.A nice location, especially if you are staying at the Hyatt as you can just walk across from the lobby.",Tui B
30,Travel and Adventure Show Times Two,"This was my second visit to the Long Beach Convention Center and both were to go to the Travel and Adventure show. I thought that the facility could have been better. I was excited to hear one of the speakers, but I was sitting under an air vent and it was so cold that I could not stand it. Several people sat next to me and they couldn't take it and changed seats or left before I did. I didn't want it to beat me, but in the end, I left with a runny nose and goosebumps. In other areas it was slightly warm. I should have known better because the same thing happened the year before. The parking is $10 and the walk was LONG to get to the event. Some of the walkways inside the event were crowded based on how many people were there and to me, if they would have organized it a little better, people would not have pushed me around so much.The bathrooms had several stalls out of Toilet paper and the lines in the bathroom were long when I came in and when I left. That is ridiculous in my opinion. Also, it was hard to see if the stalls were occupied.I asked a question of the Long Beach attendant when I was leaving and they had no knowledge and then started ignoring me to take a personal call.Overall the show was fun but the convention center itself could be better run in my opinion.",LAtoEverywhere
50,Great Place For A Trade Show,"Beautiful view, excellent meeting space. Can walk to numerous restaurants and beach not far. Cafe food in lobby was actually pretty good with healthy choices.",SanDiegoHotel
40,Perfect home for LA Travel & Adventure Show,This year I visited LA Travel & Adventure Show at the Long Beach Convention Center for the first time . I liked the set up and the ease of navigating the center and overall I think I liked this show better here than at the bigger brother--LA Convention Center. Very clean and nice facility is located right next to The Pike. There are plenty of awesome restaurants and the parking was relatively easy since we came early. We had a nice time afterwards exploring the area.,Tatiana G
40,"Great venue for shows, not always easy for exhibitors","This is my second year of participating in the LA Travel & Adventure Show at the Long Beach Convention Center. I like it considerably better than the LA Convention Center, but it's not always easy for exhibitors, especially with getting our booth materials out. The physical layout and limited elevators make for a somewhat frustrating experience trying to get materials to our vehicles, as well as long waits for elevator service.The food concessions at the convention center are ludicrous and ridiculously expensive at best, and blatantly incompetent at their worst (watching them try to just cut and serve a slice of pizza was like watching the Three Stooges in action). If you are going to an event at the convention center, avoid the concessions at all cost and go to one of the actual restaurants available within one block of the center.The bathrooms were kept clean, though one did have to wonder what it took to get soap to actually be produced from the automatic soap dispensers. People were doing the sink dance going from one sink to the next, just trying to get some microscopic dollop of liquid soap to wash their hands (in the midst of flu season).Still, we always get a great crowd at this convention center, and the staff seems professional and helpful, so we'll keep coming back.",Steve B

40,Nice Convention Center for Large Conferences,"The American Astronomical Society has apparently settled on this convention center as one of its ""standard"" places to hold its annual meeting. Of the convention centers that are used for this convention, I like this one the most. Well organized room layout, nice main convention hall, and centrally located.",Jeff M
50,Very user friendly and wonderful staff,While attending a 4-day conference in Long Beach we were very pleased with this facility. It was easy to access from our hotel and the meeting rooms were very comfortable. We appreciated the consistently good seating and temperature of the conference rooms and the restrooms were impeccably clean. Must mention that the staff was really great. Our final evening of the conference was a very large dinner that the banquet staff handled so beautifully they deserve a very special thank you!!!,happy4travel

50,Best in the West,"We hold two annual events at the LBCEC. The staff there is incredibly responsive and capable, and the facility is very well-located in the southern California market. They have plenty of affordable parking spaces (always a challenge in SoCal) and easy access to public transportation. The building itself has recently undergone a renovation and will be absolutely lovely once they change the carpet (the last phase of the reno).This Center is one of the finest to work with, and is well-located with easy access to hotels and restaurants. It's about a 30 minute ride to LAX or about 20 minutes to Long Beach Airport.",Martha D
30,Uncomfortable seats,"Went to Cirque du Soleil this weekend. Seat was very uncomfortable. I could feel the metal on the back of the cushion. I even switched seats with two other people and they were all the same. One of them was a little better so I sat in that one. We called some maintenance people over but they would have just moved one of us and that wouldn't work. Also, it was very dark going in. It was hard to find the row numbers. Don't understand why they kept it so dark 1/2 hour before the show even started. I could see that maybe a few minutes before but we were very early. Maybe they don't want you to see how dingy it is. Nothing worse than sitting in uncomfortable seats for any performance. Also, tight legroom.",tripper1805

50,Many wonderful events in this unique building,"Whether it's a car show at the Grand Prix, the Dalai Lama, the Women's Conference, or any number of other major events, the LB Convention Center, located near the Queen Mary, the Aquarium, the Pike, and Shoreline Village is probably the best on in Southern Cal. It's giving LA a run for the money! And you can get there by water shuttle, too!",DSclar
50,International Quilt Show at the Long Beach Convention Center,"The Long Beach Convention Center was very easy to find and parking was easy too. The signs to the convention center were easy to follow and we didn't get lost on our first try. The International Quilt Show which was held at the convention center when we were there was amazing. The people that organize this quiltshow are good at what they do. There was no waiting in long lines to come into the center and the staff was very helpful and pleasant. We had a good time there and enjoy the show. Whether you are a quilter or not, this show is something to see. It is held here at the Long Beach Convention Center every summer in July I am told. I plan on taking a trip again next year if I am in the area.",Anita D
40,From a Vendors Point of View,The Convention Center people were very organized and did a great job of getting our exhibit in and out of the vendor hall. The concessions are extremely over-priced and underwhelming.,atlohi
30,Meh,"There were two large tech-ish conferences happening, and one non tech-ish conference ... so 3 conferences. And they only had their coffee stand staffed with TWO people. One to take and make orders, and one to ring up the order. Poor planning in my opinion. And this was at 8:30am, still prime coffee ordering time in my book.The 'vegetarian' meal was the saddest thing I've ever seen. It was about a cup of baby spinach, 3 slices of tofu (1in x 2in x .5in), handful of baby tomatoes, and an overly vinegar-y balsmic vinegar dressing. Blech.Parking only took cash. Who does that at a conference center? Had to turn around and go find an ATM.",Sophia C
