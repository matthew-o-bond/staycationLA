50,Great walking/hiking!,"we've gone several times as its only minutes inside Beverly Hills north of Sunset...surprise with lake, good parking...",Trudi G
50,Stunning,"I found this gem by making a wrong turn. It was one of my highlights of my trip. They're were filming something when I was there but didnt pay much attention because the overlooks, the river EVERYTHING was stunning. Coming from Chicago these areas are not accessible. Truly fantastic and if I was prepared I would have spent time hiking.",chevoughnd76
30,Good for young childern,Good for young children and it is peaceful . Pond has ducks turtle. Be careful of Poison oak and snakes. Small easy trails It has an amphitheater and interesting classroom,sorabh
10,Not worth it!,"First, the reservoir is badly silted in, so it doesn't look anything like the TV footage. Second, it's overcrowded. Third, they aggressively ticket visitors using cameras,and the fines are $175. The video footage showed me stopping, but they wouldn't give any flexibility. Who needs this aggravation!?!",JKD-LA
20,Watch out,The MRCA oversees this pretty place by paying their bills with scam tickets from stop sign cameras. This is not a way to encourage community access nor gain public support for protecting this parkland! Why not figure out a respectable way to fundraise to support this place instead?,natasha
10,PSA,Don't drive or park there unless you're prepared for $100+ tickets. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority will photograph and video your vehicle so they may send you tickets in the mail. Tickets you legally have to pay. Horrible that this is allowed to go on while people are trying to enjoy nature with their families. It never ends in LA.,Lace V
50,Walking In Franklin Canyon,Franklin Canyon is an oasis in the heart of Beverly Hills where only the rich and famous can afford to live. But the Canyon is a place where people from all walks of life can afford to go and get away from the hectic pace of Los Angles' hectic city life.Franklin Canyon which in its past was the scene of television shows as Andy Griffith and Combat (as well as numerous television commercials) is now a state park open to the public. And it is here where one can relax and take in the park's natural beauty where there are nature trails excellent for hiking and ponds where there are ducks. Tall coniferous trees abound here as well to relax from under the hot summer days and there is a no smoking ban in place due to the many wildfires that take place throughout much of California.,Scott P

50,Fun Family Adventure,"Franklin Canyon Reservoir Loop is a great family experience! The trails are family friendly.We would suggest rugged outdoor-geared strollers only.Bring lots of water.The bathroom is clean!Ducks, geese, turtles, and frogs can be seen near the water. *sorry, feeding the ducks is not allowed*Lots of poison oak but if you stick to the clear trails you will be just fine!The roads are small and tight a be careful of oncoming traffic and move to the side to let others pass.Cell phone service for Verizon is sparse but available along the roads.Use this address for best access:2600 Franklin Canyon DrBeverly Hills, CA 90210United States",Elle F

50,Nature in the middle of Beverly Hills,"This little park has a cute lake with turtles in it and a pond with ducks. Lots of plants, good place to walk the dogs. It is also near the Tree People where there are more nature trails.",eyemlucky
50,Nice place for family outing,"The area has many different trails that will suit all in the family. Small kids can walk leisurely around the lake. Many resting places and plenty of picnic areas. There are ducks, turtles and koi fishes. The trail around the lake are mostly shady. There are other trails that are more challenging. You will be rewarded with an overview of the lake area or the valley depending which trail you pick. There are also visitors center and amphitheater. When you drive in, please make a complete stop at the stop sign. There is a camera to catch people who do a rolling stop.",Jim S

10,"DIRTY, CROWDED, NASTY COPS","Little parking. Filthy conditions. Vicious, fat, nasty cops to ruin your day. Hard to get to with lots of extra traffic at all the wrong times when you'd like to use it or access it. This is not a place that is friendly to pets at all.",TravelPlenty5
50,Take a step back in time in the middle of LA!,I adore this little secret hideout. The path around the pond is like going back in time to when the Indians lived here. The history of this little pocked in paradise is well worth the winding road to get here. I've been coming here for over 40 years to get away in the middle of a crazy day. Sometimes a 2 hour lunch in a quiet nature preserve is exactly what the soul needs. Nice place to re-set.,510kerryg
40,Surprisingly quiet area just minutes from Rodeo Drive,"We drove up here after seeing the holiday decorations on Rodeo drive and though it's only a few minutes away it is worlds apart. An antidote to the hype. Definitely a little off the beaten path (though like anything in LA, you're not going to have it entirely to yourself). The 'heavenly pond' as it is called on hikespeak.com had multiple types of ducks, as well as koi and turtles. Good way to find a bit of space on a Sunday afternoon!",WestwoodTrekker

50,I Shouldn't Tell You About this Hidden Gem,"Went in the afternoon on advice of a friend. Only 8 other people were seen in the park. Hidden ponds in a canyon off Mulholland by Coldwater Canyon Rd. Lots of colorful water fowl - Wood Ducks (the most colorful) and beautiful mallards. Turtles in the water and frogs at the edge. A path all around the ponds made for great photography with lots of natural blinds. Great park.(Psst, don't tell to many people or you'll spoil it.)",Stanton M
50,Stunning Place,"Decided to try Franklin Canyon instead of Runyon this time. Absolutely loved it here. Not so many people, green landscapes, water, turtles, lots of birds - difficult to believe you were only a couple of miles from Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Now our most go to place for a walk. Check out the Heavenly Pond and the main lake, and the trails leading off the road. The turtles are amazing and very inquisitive! Saw Bull Frogs for the first time too. A special place.",MarcusM777
50,hidden treasure,"this is a great place to take kids, there are turtles galore .. it is directly across from tree people on muhulland and coldwater canyon. follow the street through the neighborhood and eventually you will find it. i took a few students there on a hike on a monday (5pm) part of the trail is on road which during rush hour, can get a bit busy. we had to stop numerous times to let the cars pass. the kids loved it. make sure you stop at the stop signs! they have cameras and are very vigilant about full stops! tickets are over $150. i rolled through a stop sign...it was in the middle of nowhere and when i did stop, obviously it was too late. but the scenery is lovely.",suzzbuzz12345
40,nice place for a run/hike in beverly hills,"Not a huge park but plenty of room for hiking and running. Many old tv shows/movies were filmed here, including my WW 2 favorite, COMBAT!. Nice area for picnics. Not a real hiking destination if you are far away, but if you're staying in the area it's the best in Beverly Hills!",knightline
50,Awesome Park!,"Awesome park for walking, hiking, picnicking ... For a park tucked into the hills, it was a wonderful gem; we saw dozens of turtles and some ducks around the lake and lizards on the hike, and many birds. Picnic tables (all under trees) scattered around the scenic grounds with garbage cans everywhere. Wonderful hiking trails; mostly shaded. I was so impressed with the cleanliness!",lm1109
50,Visited to see where the Andy Griffith show opening was filmed,I visited solely to find the spot where Andy and Opie walked to the fishing hole. A beautiful and tranquil area that's not far removed from the craziness of LA traffic.,Marblehead750
50,Shady and attractive,"This is a great place to walk or hike on a warm (hot) day, as there is actually a lot of shade.The signage is not great, but you can find information online about hikes and trails here. There are a lot of options at different levels of difficulty.Be aware that the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy relies on traffic tickets for a portion of its income. They have lots of stop signs with warnings that you will get a ticket if you don't stop. Take these signs VERY seriously, and make sure you come to a full stop in the right position. We got a ticket in one of their parks a few years ago. They spend money on video surveillance, rather than restrooms, benches, better signage, and other things to make the park more comfortable for visitors. They record your license plate and mail you the ticket, with a link to the video showing that your stop was not perfect. If only they cared as much about picnic tables and toilets!The park was not crowded, despite it being a Saturday. I don't think this area is very well known. The parking areas are small, but we didn't have trouble finding a place to park. We chose a short walk around the lake, where we saw turtles and ducks. There are a few picnic tables in odd spots, and a couple of places where there are benches.The walk around the lake was very easy. Part of it can be done on a level paved road. The dirt trail is a bit narrow, and some parts of it are a little bit steep or require going down a stairway to access. Overall, this is a very easy hike. Some of the other hikes in the area appear to be more challenging, so there is something for everyone. Bring water (and food if you are going to be there for the day).",Rosemary W
40,"A little confusing, but very pretty","There are many trails to take--and even the main road is nice. There is a lot of wildlife. I saw a coyote, large turtles (not afraid to come right up to people), ducks (very friendly), swans, etc.",Allise W
50,"GORGEOUS, TRANQUIL,GREAT HIKE","Beautiful park off the beaten path. You get there through lower Coldwater Canyon onto Beverly Dr, and if you keep on going you come out on mullholland and Coldwater Canyon. Huge pond to walk around. If you bring a dog, keep it on a leash as there are plenty of coyotes around. A number of small parking lots for your car. Lovely grounds. A hidden gem.",Jean H
50,Beautiful piece of nature close to Beverly Hills,"This is so close to Beverly Hills, it is amazing, the lake is gorgeous with always lots of ducks and geese, it is great to walk your dogs around the lake ( they have to be leashed or you will get a ticket) and if you are a hiker there are so many trails .",MakeMyBed
50,"Beautiful, quiet park","A stunning park, so close to the bustling city. It's quiet and rugged, with great paths for hiking. There were dog walkers and joggers but you get the impression most tourists don't know about the plave. Highly recommended as a way to escape the city!",Sarsywarsy
50,A Hidden Forest in Beverly Hills,"Who knew!? Locals consider this canyon/forest such a treasure, that I almost feel guilty giving its ""secret"" away. Yet Franklin Canyon Park is the first place I recommend when visitors are looking for a delightful slice of nature just minutes from glitzy Rodeo Drive and the mega-mansions of Coldwater Canyon. There are trails for hiking, a nature center and a vast grassy area for playing football or picnicking. But my favorite spot is the lake/reservoir that's hidden among towering redwood, pine and oak trees, and is home to ducks, fish and rather formidable turtles that may well be the offspring of terrarium pets abandoned here by their former owners.",JulioGM
50,Hike and relax at Franklin Canyon Park,"This park is owned by the Federal GovernmentIt is wonderful for hiking, picknicking and relaxing.

40,"Hidden gem, makes you think you've left the world behind","Took a hike here with friends on Saturday morning. Lots of parking in the lot and bathrooms if you need a pit-stop before your hike. Our hike was about 2 miles-first 1/2 seemed nearly straight uphill, but we were rewarded with beautiful views to the west-we could see the ocean, but if it had been clear it would have been stellar!We did a loop hike and came down the road the last 1/4 mile or so. Great way to get your heart pumping and very family and pet-friendly (just please remember to pick up after your dog and take your trash with you).This is a real hidden gem and although we saw other hikers, it was easy to forget we were just minutes from Beverly Hills.I look forward to returning!",Saranger
50,Wanna Get Away??,"What a lovely escape from the hustle and bustle of LA!! My dogs and I absolutely LOVE this park. Lots of great hiking trails, picnic areas, and peace and quiet. Highly recommend.",Teresa P
40,Great hiking trails,"Interesting to us being from out of state. The hiking trails are numerous and with challenges suitable to most physical abilities. The outdoor education classroom has exhibits on local animals and plants and very clean washrooms. It has a small gift shop with vending machines and the park was well patrolled and supervised. A great place for views of the city and the hill top homes. Admission and parking is free. We spent a couple of hours walking the ""easy"" trails while more fit and younger members did the loop trails. Well worth the time.",fishingdavep
40,Kids loved the ducks,Had a very enjoyable morning walking around the lake. It is a little hard to find. Easy walk for kids(2 year old and 9 year old). I saw couples with kids and lots of couples of all ages.,wilywizard
50,Perfect out for young/young and old/older,"Sunny day during winter break and we wanted to get the kids out of the house after a couple of rainy days. Thought of going to the zoo, but once we got into the car, we headed toward ""the road not taken"" and that indeed ""made all the difference"".The park is simply beautiful - the combination between the hills, the trees and the water create a tranquil feeling. There are pathways to follow - perfect for kids, who want to run around, but not too difficult for their younger siblings or grandparents.The best part were the birds and the ducks in the water and banks. They were so peaceful and not afraid of visitors, which allowed us to get a good view and observe them.And the best part was that it was free: no entry fee, no additional costs for the ""extra"" and no vendors selling balloons or ice cream. Freedom of Nature and a few apples to munch on.",Judy Y
50,Physically Moderate Hiking Trails With Awesome LA Views at Top,This is a wonderful natural park with many options for either biking around the small lake or hiking up into the mountain trails. Some trails are fairly steep and the climb to the top is a good 45 - hour or more depending on level of experience. It's best to start in the early morning or late in the day to avoid the hot sun during warm days if your taking the hike up the mountain trails. I've biked it and hiked it and enjoyed both experiences. The best part is the view of the LA skyline along the way and the entire view when you hit the top. On a clear day you can see for MILES! Great for families.,tishtop

50,Great early morning hike,Went on a great easy morning hike on a recent visit to LA. Love the area & the great hiking trails it offers. There is a lovely lake with ducks & beautiful vegetation. It's also easily navigated on foot so can be a great venue for families.,Debby S
40,Hidden Gem in the middle of the city,"One of the best parks in the city. If you're looking for an alternative to Runyon Canyon, this is it. A lot less crowded, cleaner , a lot more green and most important. tons of free parking!! I bring the kids for little nature walks and there's a prefect trail that goes around the reservoir lake, it's about 30mins walking and they love it. There's also a little pond filled with turtles,Koi and ducks where you can just come and have a little peace and quiet. If you're looking for something more challenging, there are tons of trails of different levels of difficulty.This is also a great place for photography, between the reservoir lake, the pound, all the different plants and just all the scenery in general, there are plenty of great shots to take.This is truly a gem in the middle of the city, would give it a 5 star if it wasn't for those sneaky stop sign cameras. If you decide visit the park be aware of those stop sign cameras!! Make full stops at the signs and you will have a great time. If you don't, you will get a $100.00 violation via mail and it will ruin your experience.So make full stops, bring water, bring your camera and have a good time.",Fernando M
40,A great place to go hiking,There are so many different hikes you can do here it's great. You won't believe you're in Beverly Hills once you enter the park with lush trees and even water with resident turtles and ducks. Hike with the locals while you're on holidays (but you'll need a car to get there).,Wanda6969
40,A Little Peace and Quiet in the Big City,"Was recently in LA and had an hour to kill early on a Sunday morning. Looked for a park via GPS and this came up close to my location. It was a great place to take a nice quiet walk - indeed was amazed it was so quiet (except for some dog who was upset about something and the occasional airliners that started flying over after 9 am or so). Highly recommended.p.s. it is the first place that I ever saw ""redlight"" cameras for stop signs.",interceptpubs
40,Great urban hiking grounds,"Not as crowded as other hiking trails in Los Angeles (a great alternative to Runyon Canyon), this park is also more green (for a bit more shade on the long walks), and includes a reservoir lake (where ""The Andy Griffith Show"" filmed) and a pond (with turtles, koi, and ducks). Some of the trails are very steep, and can be somewhat tricky in dry weather (ground tends to give way in parts where it is all loose rock and dust). Bring water, stay on the trail (to avoid poison oak or rattlesnakes), and watch your step. Once you get up to higher elevations, you can look down and get nice views of western Los Angeles, and some of the Beverly Hills mansions that are tucked into the hills, and would otherwise never be visible to you.",Ray Q
40,Great hiking!,A great place in the middle of the city to go for a hike ... there is a reservoir at the top where you can sit and enjoy watching the ducks!,Robin R
50,Very cool park and lake,Enjoyable drive throughout the park and canyon. Places to park lakeside to sit or enjoy water fowl. Great place to bring a picnic.,sjmbdm
50,Great urban retreat,"Visited Franklin Canyon Park on a Wednesday morning while staying in Beverly Hills. We hiked to the top of the Hastain Trail, which afforded fantastic views of the canyon, LA, and the Pacific beyond. We saw a few other people along the way, but it still felt quite secluded and not in any way crowded.The total distance was about 2.5 miles round trip with enough elevation gain to get the oxygen and blood flowing, but not too strenuous. The trail was easy to follow and perfect for some fresh air and exercise.The park was easy to get to, with entrances set in neighborhoods below Mulholland Drive. Be aware of the stop signs and low speed limit within the park, as you don't want to be ticketed.Parking was ample and free, which is not the case in many other places.This park has also played host to Hollywood and rock stars throughout the years. It may be best known as the setting for opening of The Andy Griffith Show, and you can still trace the same steps around the lake.If you're looking for an alternative to Runyon Canyon without the hassle and crowds, this should be it.",ADemonDeacon
40,Nice Quiet Park Within Los Angeles,"This is a park with hiking trails, good bird watching and pretty vegetation in the Santa Monica Mountains near Mulholland Drive and Coldwater Canyon Ave. north of Beverly Hills. Great area to walk dogs or hike up the hillsides for beautiful views. The bottom of the canyon has a road with parking and bathrooms. No food or drinks are sold here. The trails go off in different directions up both sides of the canyon with views at the top overlooking Los Angeles. On clear days, you can see the coast and the island of Catalina. This park gets a little crowded on the weekends, so I recommend early morning hikes here.",alanmhersh
50,shhhh. . . it's a secret!,"This is one of my absolute favorite places. It has not been bombarded by all those annoying tourist buses. Thank goodness! It is a bit of the countryside in a big city. And if you are coming to Los Angeles to visit, it is a wonderful place to enjoy - peace, quiet and beauty. There are lots of ducks and some other wildlife. Kids will enjoy looking for turtles and bull frogs. If you are lucky you might see a rabbit or two. There is a hill to hike up with an amazing view on clear days. On the other side of the park is a lake and a pond.It is best to rent a car to visit this place. Just know the roads are very narrow and people walk every where - so drive safely.",josephine1996
30,Best Hike Ever!,"Best hike, walk, or run don't be surprise if you are jogging or walking the trail with Keenan Reeves. Very safe place! Maybe you would like to enjoy yoga etc..

50,Whistle the Andy Griffith Theme When You Find the Lake!,"We went to Franklin Canyon Park on a quest to find the location that was used for the opening to the Andy Griffith Show. We found it! The upper lake, Franklin Canyon Lake is only about 3 acres, so you can easily hike around it on the trails. Part of the lake has a marsh where there are turtles and ducks galore--perfect for up close photography. My husband spotted the location of the Andy Griffith Show theme, and we took many photos in that area. The lake and forest are very picturesque, so bring a camera. A water bottle is good on a warm day, but the hiking here isn't too extreme. They have a large visitors center, where they also teach classes. A hidden gem.",cynsha
50,Fun relaxed hike,"It was so beautiful here. There were two ponds, lots of trails, beautiful trees, and a very cool visitors center. I'd definitely go back again",paigelewis4

50,HIDDEN GEM,"If you want a quick escape from Beverly Hills, Hollywood or the Valley and you're tired of Runyan Canyon or Fryman Canyon, this is the place for you. Franklin Canyon Park is truly a beautiful quiet hidden gem that is a must go to if you've never visited it before. Drive up from the city or the valley and you will be shocked at the size and beauty of this park that is hidden in a residential area. I am always surprised by how many people who live in LA have never even heard of this park. It has 2 beautiful lakes and many dirt trails that traverse the hillside. You can also walk around the lake on the paved road. There are bathrooms at the Sooky Goldman Nature Preserve which is part of this compound. The park is over 600 acres and has 5 miles of hiking trails. There are many birds to watch here especially ducks on the pond. You can walk your dog on a leash. Just be careful of the cars that cut through from Beverly Hills. Also, for those of us who have already been ticketed, make sure that you don't come to a rolling stop at any of the stop signs in the park. There are cameras that photograph your license tags and you will get a hefty ticket in the mail. I can't recommend this park enough. You will feel that you are in on one of the great secret respites in LA!!!Some interesting trivia: The park was originally a summer retreat for the Doheny family in the 1930s. The Lake was the “fishing hole” in the opening credits of The Andy Griffith Show, as well as the lagoon in the Universal Studios film Creature from the Black Lagoon.",interplanetary
