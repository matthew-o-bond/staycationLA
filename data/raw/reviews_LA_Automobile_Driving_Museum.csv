40,Interesting Car Museum close to LAX,This is a high quality small car museum close to LAX. It is unique in that you are allowed to sit in most of the cars if you wish. It is an interetsing collection from the earliest motoring years until approx. 2000.The industrial building that it is housed in is nicely restored and suits the collection. We visited on a Tuesday but apparently on Sundays rides are offered in selected cars.Well worth a visit for the small donation requested.Obviously created by someone who likes the cars to be used not just collected for the sake of it. Exceptional.,Fredbloggs2014
50,A great place to visit,"This museum is wonderful for those who love vintage cars. They have a wonderful collection of restored vehicles and very knowledgeable folks to share information with you. Paul was particularly helpful and provided wonderful information. Most of the automobiles were available for people to touch and sit in, too!",Maryann R.
50,Sunday: Ride in three Cars day,Go on Sunday if at all possible! They bring out three cars (it rotates each week) and give rides! We all enjoyed it. The cars are gorgeous and they let you sit in most of them. We had one 11 year old and one in an electric wheelchair so we did not go in the special tour room but could look from the outside. We heartily encourage visits!,dashdashdashdash
40,Quality collection of classic cars,"Great collection of classic cars including docent tours of some that are glassed off. Good sized collection too, perhaps 50. Both exquisite and ordinary ones. Will not disappoint classic car aficionados. Was an office event so do not know about entrance, food etc. located in an industrial type of building in an industrial part of El Segundo",reggie300
50,Brother In-Law Car Lover,In-laws were in town and we don't live to far from this place. My brother in-law and I went down for a quick 2-3 hour visit. Its a neat little place with some high end vehicles but mostly middle of the back collector cars. It was very cool to see the old cars displayed from back in the day. It was an enjoyable afternoon.,Fearless52621020071
50,Best secret in town.....,"Surprised by the effort taken. Voluntary contribution (no entrance fee) and the possibility to look, sit and touch every vehicle displayed. Beautiful cars. You have the opportunity to make a ride (I did) in 1, 2, or 3 cars. Do NOT miss this museum as it deserves your visit.",G. op het Veld
50,A great collection of vehicle history,"If you love cars and the history of automobiles then The El Segundo Automobile Driving Museum is a must see.Offering Car rides on Sundays, Event hosting and loads of history. The collection ranges from 20th century, up to 60s and 70s muscle cars.You can actually touch and get inside the cars. A pretty cool place and its fun for the kids",Wanderer802867
50,A MUST visit place,"What a find!!!!Our son is a massive car fan, this museum is fantastic. You can sit in almost all of them. There are some rare cars here, and even an English corner. If you visit Sunday's you can be driven around in one, pity we could get there.VERY knowledgeable hosts can answer all your questions.",mehereinthepool
50,Fun museum,"We went on a Sunday, not busy, all kinds of cars you can actually get in and touch them. Also on Sundays, they give you a ride on one of the cars they have available for rides.",lv2trvlSanDiego
50,A Fun Car Museum,"Not only do they take you for a ride in a significant old car, you can open the doors and sit in most of the cars. Only a few are marked do no touch. I had a ride in a 1941 Plymouth that was smooth riding and quiet and a 1951 Packard done up as a police car. The Packard's straight 8 pulled strongly and the Packard designed and built Ultramatic transmission with the worlds first lock-up torque converter was flexible and effective for a 'one-speed'. I sat in older Packards, Cadlillacs, a Lincoln Continental, a Frazier, and my fave, a 1941 Dodge, where the clutch pedal action was remarkably smooth unlike the other cars.",JamesRobinsonLowe
40,Fun in El Segundo,"We visited here with friends and family - really cute and neat to see cars from the past. We made an afternoon of it - after a look at the cars and the gift shop, we went to lunch nearby.",Kim K
50,Greta place to see vintage cars,The Automobile Driving museum is a wonderful place to see vintage cars and it is an excellent venue to hold any type of event.,BGL46
50,Super Fun!,This is a great place to visit and learn about classic cars. They even let us take pics inside the cars!,LivPurple
40,An Unexpected Delight,"Because I work in the industry and was staying in the neighbourhood, I had planned to look in on this place anyway, but we actually stumbled across it while looking for a place to eat. They were hosting a ""car show"" which included a bunch of vehicles you don't usually see at car shows (station wagons, a Chrysler Newport, an 80's Honda Accord, etc) and the museum was free. I dragged my family (wife, two teenage daughters) in against their wishes and they ended up loving it! Not only do they allow you to sit in a lot of the cars, but it is such an eclectic mix that there is something for everyone who has ever been in a car...and most of the vehicles aren't trailer queens (meaning you can get up close and personal with them). Our two minute visit turned into well over an hour and we all had a great time. Highly recommend!",jerminator67
50,Great for Events!,I’ve been to several events at the museum now and every one has been a treat for the senses. They have rooms and areas inside and out that you can freely wander and even an olde ice cream parlor that makes me wanna be 10 again. The main showroom is a great place to get nostalgic as you visually caress the curves of cars from days gone by. Not sure how often they change the themes around but it’s been different each time I’ve been there. Classy place to meet and it’s super clean and the folks there are very nice.,loritastic
50,Hidden gem!,Some truly rare & beautiful cars here. Mainly run by volunteers everybody was friendly welcoming & helpful. They allow hands on interactions & offer an old school ice cream parlour. Definitely recommend to spend a few hours here.,Sarah E
50,Great little museum,"I was pleasantly surprised by the collection here, mostly American cars from the 1910's to 1970's and a nice cross section of vehicles. They may not be of the prestigious level of the Nethercutt or Mullin museums but are all worthy of preservation. The setting is very comfortable and the docent I spoke to was very knowledgeable. I hope to go back for one of there numerous special events or Sunday rides. A great days outing when combined with the nearby Flight Path Museum.",corvette2005
50,Go for a ride and view an excellent exhibit of older cars.,"We really enjoyed this car museum. Since our time was short, we did not take the offer to go for a ride, but our guide took us into the special section with the glamorous cars. We liked the format here which is not seen in many car museums. The cars are positioned separately so one can walk around each car and observed the detail from all sides. The other bonus is that the cars go from the pre 1900’s to the 1960’s and there is no dominate brand nor style, with varied manufacturers. The price for this museum is very reasonable and that is a real treat.",4cents-worth
50,Absolutely worth it,"This was one of the places we visited while in LA, went at opening and had an amazing time, the docents are knowledgeable and very friendly, Sunday's are take a ride in one of their car days, they change them up every week, so much fun for a car enthusiast, and my teenage daughter. 🙂",Chris C
50,Beautiful Cars!!,My buddy from Santa Rosa met me at LAX. We'd come to see cars and the Automobile Driving Museum got us off to a great start! Beautiful cars of every make and model. The stars were 3 breathtaking Packards and a '31 Caddy that ranks with the most beautiful cars I've seen. We spent several hours there and really enjoyed our selves.,Bob A
50,What a great collection - a hidden gem,"Due to an unplanned layover in LA, I had a sometime on my hands. Turned to TripAdvisor and this recommendation came up. The museum does not have set entry fee and asks for donations. I spent 2 hours looking at the amazing collections of cars from all eras of automotive history. There are plenty of activities for family / children too but my family were not traveling with me but they would have enjoyed it. Highly recommended.",Simon C
10,closed for private event,Call before going as they don’t bother to let people know on their website that they would be closed for a private event.,Cristina C
50,Delightful Family Afternoon,This was an absolutely fascinating exhibit of vintage cars....enjoyed by six to sixty (plus!) year olds!,Mary Jo S
50,Very cool hole in the wall,"Went here for a company event. What a surprise, little hole in the wall museum had some great cars to look at. Its not a all day sorta place, but definitely worth an hour or 2 to check out",Kevin M
50,Cars and more,"Great collection of vintage cars. Have been there a couple times when they have had functions with the museum as the drawing point. Possibly best part, is that they have a plan for Sundays where you can be driven in one of the classic cars--I know this was done in the past, haven't been in a while, so check it out so no surprises",barry1817
40,Great Collection,"Different from most collections, you are encouraged to is inside the vehicles which affords a appreciation what driving was like in a model T or other early automobiles. Excellent collection of Packards. The museum will sponsor themed weekends throughout the year, buest to check their online schedule. Parking is free and adjacent to the building.",6_Speed_Automatic
50,Great place to spend some time!,"Lets just say this place is not big but not fancy! Its fun!They encourage you to sit in the cars and learn about them! The owner is a PACKARD enthusiast so there are a few of those there but lots of other cars as well!You'll only need about 2 hours but its worth the trip and 410 entry fee. All proceeds go directly back to the museum! Cute 50's style dinette as well! TIP: If its there while you visit, try to see if you fit in the little blue electric car way in the corner!",Joe A
50,Fantastic Collection of Cars,Having seen lots of gleaming American cars in the movies it was just great to get up close and see the real thing. They were all in amazing condition - and you could sit in most of them.,BobandJosie
50,A Fun Afternoon!,"I was privileged to be part of the group sponsored by the Annenberg Photo Field Trip. They closed the museum just for the group to allow us to photograph the cars with less interruption. The museum is small but is packed with a great collection of cars, that they rotate out so each visit is different. Most of the cars you are allowed to touch, open doors and sit inside. On Sundays they drive you around the block in specially selected cards!! I got ride in an Edsel. So much fun! I am going back for mini car day!",L P
50,Hidden gem for auto enthusiasts,"Attended a retirement event at the museum. A very impressive collection of well-kept, drivable vehicles.",W1798XGericb
50,"Excellent historic car museum, go on a Sunday and take rides in restored cars","This museum has been on my bucket list for a few years. While the museum collection is excellent, schedule your visit on a Sunday to get a ride in 3 restored cars. It was a nice sunny day and the two convertibles made for an awfully great experience. The drivers have great stories to tell you about the history of the cars and accessories.",Dennis H
40,"a quik stop..but, it very worthwhile","i had only learned of the museum late in my visit. so i did not have enuf time left to make a 'full' visit. instead, we went just to see the hi lights and decide if we wold want to see more on a subequnt trip.yes...will be back to explore all that is there. im glad we took the time for our mini visit..it will help us enjoy our 'real' visit next trip...staff were very informative and helpful..btw, it only about 5 minutes from lax...so one can sneak in a visit on their way out of town.",jhatwo
50,Car freak central,This museum has a great collection and they are always rotating the vehicles through various collectors and private owners. Sundays are the prime days to get into a classic car and go for a cruise. Saturdays are the car show days with different car clubs showing up to display their pride and joys.,Creeping_Death_LA
50,VERY GOOD AUTO MUSEUM,"We were on our way to the Los Angeles airport and had some extra time so we stopped at The Automobile Driving Museum. They had a really good collection of classic autos from the 1880's to the 1980's and they allowed you to sit in most of them. There were lots of Lincolns, Model T's and even a 1956 Metropolitan. My first car was a 1958 Metropolitan so that was interesting for me. On certain weekends it is possible to actually drive some of the cars on exhibit.",DarylJ552
50,Fantastic collection!,"This place is an unknown GEM. They have an impressive collection and you can actually get in the majority of the vehicles! The docents are so knowledgable and friendly. The vehicles are all housed in one large warehouse. They have a fantastic and very large party room if you wish to celebrate on site. If you are a gear head, you have to visit this collection. Absolutely superb.",Tess F
40,Mostly older classics,Lot of cars from the 20s to 40s. Great ccars but only a handful of newer cars. Well done. Quiet during a weekday afternoon. Good for 45min to an hour. Not overly big but well laid out. All in one room pretty much. Very friendly staff. Minutes from LAX,bruce p

50,A hidden gem,"I come from London, so I hate paying for museums. But this is outstanding value.It's a laid-back atmosphere, and the love that's been shown to the exhibits is obvious. I regret that I had time constraints and could not stay longer. You could easily spend four hours here.Thoroughly recommended.",W4Peter
50,Very interesting,On Sundays you get to ride around in a couple of classics. The volunteers at the museum are all very nice and full of information,Gordon R
40,Worth a gander around and if you are lucky...a ride,"I enjoyed the look around at the antique cars - but liked the docent style guy that shared his knowledge even more. If you are lucky you may get to take a spin in one of the antique cars - now, that is FUN! They also host parties and events which can be a great way to see the cars and have a good time.",nancyjesca
50,They are Passionate about the Museum,"What makes a museum top dog? There is a lot of competition for where to go on the weekends. The difference here is passion. They love their museum, the cars, and the space. There is always something going on, car shows, food trucks, kid activities. They also have a ice cream parlor and popcorn for the kids. Our kids love going on the weekend, Especially when the hot wheels show is going on.",NickellFamilyTravel
40,Nice little museum to visit,Nice little museum to visit. They have a pretty decent collection of cars. Check there website for any upcoming events and donation are always welcome. I like to take my son once a while a Mattel does show up once in a while showing up their cars but is not the greatest. I think they should bring out there better cars but that just me. You can have private events but you must call for prices and listing. I like their little restaurant where they serve ice cream great for the kids. It's always good to help a non profit organization.,Selvyn C
50,Something Nice in a Random Spot,Good to kill an hour or two here. The cars are well kept. All beautiful. Have some historical context that makes it not just for the eyes.,William B

50,Great experience showing how U.S. history influenced the Automobile business,We recently visited the Automobile Driving Museum in El Segundo. On Sundays they have 3 cars you can get rides in. We rode in a Packard Caribbean convertible and my husband also rode in a 1941 Lincoln. This museum has over 130 cars and I enjoyed all the signs which showed automobile history in light of U.S. history. It was a very enjoyable outing. The docents and employees were very friendly and knowledgeable. There is an ice cream parlor on site if you can get in between children's birthday parties.,Donna T
50,Make time to visit this place,"Make sure you go there on the days they offer to drive you around in the old cars. On certain days on their website they will tell you what cars are going to be available to take a ride in. We rode in a model T ford, a Buick and another car. It is a fun experience for the whole family.",112Lee
50,An other kind of museum,This is a unique little museum where you actually can touch and sit inside almost all of the cars. The staff was so nice and on your ticket you get tree rides in different cars a really good experience. This is the best automobile museum I've been to. Dont miss it.,Henning252
50,Nice Time,"If you are into classic cars you must visit. My nephew 2 1/2 years old even enjoyed the cars. Fun for the one person, couples or families.",Diane L
50,Best Car Museum in Los Angeles---next door to LAX---and NO crowds!,"If you think that going to the Peterson Museum is the be-all and end-all of car museums in Los Angeles, you're wrong! The Automobile Driving Museum is fantastic. 50-60 cars on display, all with detailed descriptions and friendly, wandering docents to give you background info. But the best part, with a few exceptions, is that you can sit in the driver's seat of the cars---from a 1909 Model-T, to Porches, Packards, Edsels and many, many more! Be sure to visit on a Sunday--that's when they pull 2-3 of the vintage cars onto the street and give docent-driven rides. We rode in all three today---a 1965 Mustang fastback, a 1957 Ford Fairlane Convertible and 1947 Packard Super-Clipper (with 3-on-the-tree transmission). A truly fun outing. Kids under 10 get in for free. Also, they rent out the space for parties and events. Have a kids birthday party or even a wedding there!",like_national_parks
50,Fun auto field trip,"Fascinating collection of mostly very old American autos. I took my 90+ year old father a few years ago and he loved it. Small and easy to get around. Free, but a donation is appreciated. Lots of fun.",TRmichaels
50,Hands On Car Museum,The ADM is a great local car museum which has a nice collection of Packards and assorted cars from the 60's and 70's. The facility is very spacious and well done. The docents and staff are very knowledgeable and pleasant to talk with. Well worth a visit. I found many of my friends who work in the aerospace industry were familiar with the building but had never visited it before. You can actually step into the cars and feel what they are like unlike other museums who only allow you to look at their cars.,BoboTravlr

50,Car lovers must see!,Really enjoyed seeing this museum and what a wonderful collection of cars. From old to new ton of history here in the bowl worth spending an hour to going throughout the museum. Very close to Los Angeles international Airport and convenient easy Uber ride over there for just a few dollars.,bb9000cde
50,A great collection,"I love auto museums and this one doesn't disappoint. Especially if you can get someone to give you a complete tour of the buildings that surround the place. The collection is fun. It doesn't include million dollar collector pieces, it's of what a car guy would get if he thought it was interesting.And they also have good popcorn.",Pat B
40,Well wroth a visit,"Smaller Auto museum with good section of vintage cares on display from early 1900 to sixties. very friendly and accommodating volunteer guides, cars are generally in good condition and few in very good state. nice touch is allowing visitors to get very close to the cares and in some cases even seat in them.\Tickets are inexpensive and it even includes a ride in vintage car after the tour..",vahehg
50,Exceptional,"Admission is by recommended donation but don't let that deter you. If you've got a larger group or usually get a discount, they expect you'll donate on par with what you think it's worth. If you come on Sunday, you may get to ride in a vehicle since they keep them operational (3 cars get taken for a drive each Sunday).","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Good place to spend a hour and see history,Its a good place to see historic automobiles from a lot of era's. Its family friendly and they change the displays every 3 months. Its a short walk across the parking lot to see the air and space museum. So i suggest seeing both. You can see both in 3 hours so it makes sense.Fun place.,Gary B
50,Fun place to visit on Sunday,"We got to ride in five classic cars! A 1964 Chevy Impala, a 1956 Cadillac, a 1956 Oldsmobile, a 1936 Cadillac Limo and a Packard that I'm not sure of the year. In addition, we got to visit the museum and take lots of pictures.",lmmarley
50,Always a treat,This is an eclectic collection that is worth seeing. The facility is very nice and on Sundays they take three cars out of the collection to drive visitors around the neighborhood. The docents are very knowledgeable and are more available than clerks at Macy's to answer questions. The cars are rotated so every visit has something different to see.,Bill W
50,For Those Really INTO Cars,"This is one car museum that you can get INTO, literally. Visitors don't have to drool at a distance from these cool cars. You can sit in them, & on sundays RIDE in them. On this my second visit, I got to ride in a '35 Chrysler Airflow. Where else could that have happened.",Markian
50,Memory Lane,"Had a great time with family (especially 18 yr old grandson) remembering some cars our families have owned. Docent was very knowledgeable and friendly. Took time to go over any questions and obviously loved his job! We rode in 2 vehicles and drive/docent hopped out to take pictures of us all!!The variety of ages and models made it enjoyable for any fan with favorites. Personal touch made this a much more enjoyable experience than bigger ""sterile"" types of museums.Go on a Sunday for the free rides (with admission of course).",Cynthia W
50,Great hands on car museum!,"On Sundays, they have about three cars (check their website for the models) that you can ride in, plus they let you sit in and touch most of the cars in the museum! Now what museum does that! They also have a special room with very high-ended old cars. They have a little ice cream parlor like the one's from the 50s. They also do parties with a show piece car. Easy to get to in a nice mixed commercial buildings and hotels.",Jackie M

They also had a cute ice cream shop off the gift shop.",tink8009
50,One of my favorite places in all of L.A.,"This is a wonderful, small, easy to navigate museum where you don't feel like cars are delicate crystal sculptures. Cars are solid metal, they are meant to be touched and ridden in!The ride schedule is posted on their website and it's great fun to plan ahead in hopes of getting to ride in a special car you have always admired.The docents and drivers are so kind and extremely well informed about the cars. That said, they are ""snobs"" about it and they are happy to talk to kids and adults alike about all of the great vehicles on display.I have visited at least 10 times and I can't wait to go back!",QuirkyTravels
50,GREAT AUTO MUSEUM AND RIDE IN AN OLD CAR,This is a great museum that does not receive the reconision it deserves. They work on donations and have a good sized collection of old cars many you only hear about but never see. There is also a good sized private collection you can view also either thru a glass wall or you can be escorted inside. There are quite a few reaqlly nice Packards in the collection. A good mix of old and modern classic cars.If you ask a docent you may be able to actually sit in a car and most docents will also give you a guided tour. On Sundays they get out one or two cars and for a $10 donation you can go for a ride in one.There is an small Ice Cream Parlor if you need a treat. If you would like to have a party they have a large room next to the cars you can rent for a fun party. The museum staff are great to work with.The museum sponsers many small car events on Saturdays and there are some auto workshops put on by the Girls in the Garage group. So check with the museum schedule if you are interested in an upcoming specific event. They also have a small gift shop.I am sorry I waited so long to get over to visit this museum and will definately be coming back often.,707clayg
50,Great Automobile Museum,Take advantage of this museum on a weekend and you may actually get an opportunity to drive a classic car. Unique vehicles - many one of a kind. 1886 Mercedes Benz is amazing. The best part of this museum is the ability to open a car and sit inside. Always ask a docent first. Great ice cream parlor next to their gift shop.,Nick B
50,Ride in a classic on Sunday's,"I have lived in El Segundo for years and never knew this place was there.

Walking in after making a donation of $10 I was greeted by another friendly gent who escorted me around to several that caught my eye. Antique cars have been in my repertoire since high school when my Dad gave me a '53 Cad. Later I acquired two more classics: a '57 T-bird and a Jag XK 150. It was fun for a few minutes to pretend while strolling through the museum. I was ""chauffeured"" in a Packard as we cruised the neighborhood to cap the afternoon.",sbducky

It was a truly unique experience to be able to ride in [some of] these old cars and sit in the display cars. Have you ever tried to get into a rumble seat? Fun.

50,"woo-hoo, a HANDS ON museum","Selection is not over the top, though they DO have a Stutz Monte Carlo, a 16 Twin-Six, a Saxon (when have you seen one?) and some very nice mid-late 30's Packards, but they key thing here is that you can TOUCH (and sit in) the vehicles. Well, I never! On Sundays, they give rides in a select few. Conversant, friendly and obviously dedicated docents. I would volunteer if I didn't live 2300 miles away. Right by the airport, unassuming, you need to stop by and budget some time to talk to the guys and gals. FIVE stars for the interactive experience.",scott r
50,Very strong luxury car collection!,Off the beaten path but well worth it if you like classic luxury cars. What a great collection.They accept donations and suggest that adults pay $10 for entrance.They also have an event center for special events,Steve E
50,Near LAX Nice Car Museum,"If you are near LAX or want to go to a car museum this is a good one especially for a Sunday Visit. They will let you take a ride in a couple of their Antique Cars only on Sunday. Museum does not take long for most to go through, but the ride is a fun part. I think it is the only Automobile Driving Museum in the US (they drive and you ride).",CalifSue
30,Ok if you have time,This place has an interesting automobile collection and would be worth visiting if you have sometime and are totally into older cars and can appreciate the collection. As a tourist must see I would say there are so many interesting things in So Cal that you might want to consider skipping this attraction.,heumanntouch
40,Suggested Donation is worth every penny,"The cars were fun to look at, but the docents were amazing, in sharing their knowledge and history of the vehicles.",Ts04935
50,Go on a Sunday,"Great place near LAX. And if you go on Sunday, they'll take you for a ride in a selection of their cars! The admission price includes a docent-led tour. Our docent - and all the volunteers we encountered - obviously love being at the ADM. Free parking and when we were there, was wonderfully un-crowded.",2Alaska09
50,Wonderful!,"Almost felt like family. Both to the cars and people who volunteerthere. Visited on Saturday, (couldn't drive) but after some ""car talk"" was invited to sit in one of the classic Packards.Especially enjoyed seeing some plain, unrestored cars ('56 Olds) that probably wouldn't have made it to a more grandiose museum. A soulful place. Thank You.",Robert S
50,Classic car's,A great collection I have not seen such a collection in one place in that good of a condition.Great to see employees with that much passion,Medhat T
40,Here's a chance to ride in an antique vehicle,"They have a much larger collection of old, classic, antique and one-of-a-kind vehicles than you would expect by the size of the place. It is sort of hard to find on a side street, but most of us have GPS. Most of the cars are street worthy and they actually take people on rides in selected vehicles on Sundays. The museum is also available for a unique event experience.",rjrj
50,Fabulous cars and off the beaten track,"The Automobile Driving Museum is a hidden gem! I've lived nearby for 30 years and found out about it just a year ago thanks to a friend's retirement party! They have a beautiful collection of cars, many are one of just a few left in the world, several were owned by Clark Gable, and each is jaw-dropping gorgeous. This little museum is well-laid out with interesting facts about each car on display. Parking is free. We spent about 1.5 hours here and saw everything at a leisurely pace. Some of them will bring back memories, others will make you feel like you've walked into a BBC period piece. We visited on a Thursday but if you visit on a Sunday you can actually go out riding in one of their cars! And -- if you have a special event coming up . . . this place has a great party facility and, of course, great decor!",GandC71187
40,"Fun, Fun, Fun","Automobile Driving Museum is a treasure. The museum isn't real big, but can occupy your time for a few hours.Tucked into an old brick building in El Segundo, there is plenty of parking and the donation amount is worth it.You will find quite a few Packard models as the owners love Packards, but there are plenty of other cars to see. Each car has an information sheet in front of it so there is plenty of reading and history passed on.On Sundays they pull 3 cars out of the museum and offer rides. Check their website for the calendar on which cars the docents will be driving.The Sunday we visited we were able to ride in a 1931 Ford Model A, a 1932 Buick 90 Victoria and the 1936 Packard Phaeton owned by Joseph Stalin and used quite a few times in the Rose Parade. The cars are beautiful and to ride in them is an extra fun experience.After you have enjoyed the museum and car models that fill a display case, stop in to the old fashioned ice cream parlor for a trip back in time and a treat.",beetrvln
50,Great place to spend a few hours,"Great little museum.The staff was so friendly and accommodating, offering to allow me to climb into any of the cars, with their oversight, and offering to take photos for me.Recommend all car enthusiasts visit if nearby!",SNEVMAN
30,Very good but comparatively a little overpriced,"I love cars and I found this car museum to be very interesting. It's very easy to find and there is no problem parking free outside.Where I have a little difficulty is with Value For Money and I really can't help comparing it with the Petersen in LA. With all due respect to El Segundo ADM, the Petersen is head and shoulders superior and they charge $15, only $10 for seniors. ADM charges $10. They call it a donation but you won't get in unless you make it, so they might as well talk straight and call it what it is - an entry fee! OK, ADM offers a ride on Sundays, but I couldn't make it on Sunday, I'm not all that interested in riding the old gals anyway and it's the same price without a ride the rest of the week. If they dropped the price to $5 (I think it was that a year or so back) I would probably not hesitate to visit several times over a longish period and they'd actually make more out of me overall! I'd love to score it 4 stars but lowish VFM forces a drop to 3 stars - sorry.I don't regret visiting - I definitely did enjoy it. But I'd be very hesitant to visit a second time, especially with companions who didn't actively share my enthusiasm for old cars. Please don't let me put anyone off - I'd hate to see this place fade away. But maybe leave some feedback about a lower price perhaps earning a slightly greater income, overall.",John-Tropi
50,ADM ...a Ride Back in Time,"The ADM is a few miles south of LAX. This museum has a collection of various years of cars with an emphasis on Packards. Admission of $10 (donation) includes a guided tour and a free ride in three vintage cars that ADM has chosen..........but only on Sunday. ADM is open Tuesday through Sunday 10am to 4pm.The museum is small but it is more up close and personal with the cars. With assistance from the docent, you can have your picture taken in a number of the cars on display. Allow 2-3 hours. Whenever we have visiting guests we enjoy taking them to this intimate automotive museum after we have picked them up at LAX.",Esther K
50,Great Car Museum in LA (Not Peterson).,This place was great! It is close to LAX. They have a great collection of cars from many decades. Well worth a trip!,DissDog
40,This is a cool collection,It is a little out of the way but a great place for any car enthusiast. What makes it special is every car in the collection is a driver. They have a schedule of what car is driving when and my plan is to go back and have a ride in a classic,ianbeavis
40,Fun to ride in old cars,"Museum is located just south of LAX. They have a warehouse full of interesting cars, many from the 1920s and 30s. A docent led our group of 10 around and she did a great job of explaining the unique features of many of the cars. On Sunday they take out four cars and take you on rides in them. We rode in a Model T and a 1951 Packard police car.",xsteves
40,Nice short stop,Lots of neat cars but it didn't take more than 15-20 minutes to go through the whole museum. They do have Sunday afternoon rides but we weren't able to make it. Not the largest or the best in LA but a nice break regardless.,MommaMia21
50,Interesting Museum,"This museum is a collection of many old, meticulously maintained, vintage, special cars. With a very few exceptions, they are American cars. What makes this museum even more special is that on a Sunday they bring a few of the cars out front and, for a small fee which really goes to the maintenance of the facility, you can be taken for a ride in one of the cars. Check their website for details of which cars will be available for riding in that week. That is why it is called a ""driving"" museum. You can still go during the week and view the cars, but no rides then. There are ""docents"" around who are only too happy to describe the different cars to you. See also the electric train set up high in the reception area!",A D
50,A birthday surprise.,"This ended up being a perfect place to host a surprise party. The staff was so helpful and fun to work with. We were able to bring in catered food, tables, and our own bartender. Guests could check out the autos as well. And the big parking lot allowed us to get an I ice cream truck for everyone to enjoy. It was a hit and I would gladly go back for a visit or event!",Kljack19
50,hidden car paradise,"This is a relatively small but surprising museum. Great and enthusiastic staff that will share their knowledge to anyone who would like to listen. The entry fee is actually a donation with suggested fees. This includes a ride (on Sundays) on a well preserved classic car (this alone worth the entry fee). Unlike other museums, here, the staff will encourage you to touch and take pictures inside some cars!Small suggestion - the museum is very close to the LAX airport, you can stop by before taking off (3 hours is more than enough).I had lots of fun! Thanks!Say hi to Liz!",Shachar D
10,too high priced and very poor attitude of 'workers'.,"we were made to feel like we were an intrusion to 'their' day. they didn't want to talk to us about anything, untill we paid. so we walked away. if you love souped up snazzy cars, go to some other 'show', where you might feel like a valued customer",Karen L
50,"Superb collection, unique experience!","What a wonderful little treat this museum was. Not only do they have a beautiful collection of classic cars - mainly old American models, but even as a a nice surprise to this Brit a few of ours too - they are not only for show. I went on a beautiful morning and was given a ride in a couple of the cars. What an amazing experience. While I was there, several people stopped by in their own classic cars, which added even more to the visit. If you are in the area and you like cars, you simply have to go.",TripTravelling
50,Ride in a Classic Car - Only here!,"The Automobile Driving Museum has its name referring to the very interesting fact that all the cars in the museum are ready to drive on the street. This is quite a challenge to keep all these machines ready for use on the street, Really Amazing. Another point of interest is the note that the museum's admission charge is a recommended donation. Note only recommended. The autos are in one large room with about eighty cars. There is a glassed in room that visitors are not allowed to enter that houses the ultra rare classics that can be viewed from a distance. There are cars here that are in the Rose Parade each year, cars that have carried dignitaries and even one customized Packard Pickup conversion. I found the quality quantity and condition of all the cars to be excellent. After talking to one of the docents I learned that they had several cars on loan from the Peterson Museum. Quite an honor to have loaners from such a prestigious museum. The Automobile Driving Museum also has multiple additional warehouses with several hundred other cars that they rotate into the displays. This makes the museum ever changing and always interesting. Each Sunday they choose three cars and give people rides in the cars. Every Sunday they choose three different cars. Wow! and if you check in with Yelp there is an offer for Free Ice Creams. What a deal! The quality and selection of autos is marvelous and it is a worthy stop for anyone. When I was picking up my son who came in on a flight at Los Angeles International Airport, it was a simple 5 minute drive to pick him up. I found the museum to be a much more satisfying stop than a cell phone parking lot at the airport. So, plan a little extra time into your airport pickup or drop off and enjoy The Automobile Driving Museum. It is another one of the many small museums in beautiful Los Angeles area.",CharleySays

Set up as an old time luxury dealership and a garage, all the cars are driven.The cars are arranged in a logical time line and looked after by some very dedicated and knowledgeable staff. Allow yourself a couple of hours to go through the museum.This is a down to earth presentation of cars with no pretentions. They were cars that were driven by ordinary people and will bring back memories.",Phil S
40,"A great collection, if not gigantic","If you are near LAX airport save a couple hours to stop in and enjoy this fantastic auto museum. The autos range in age, type and purpose from just about every era. If you are a real good scheduler, you can arrange to ride in one of the autos as they periodically drive them around the block on a rotating basis to keep the seals oiled. Give them a call and plan your visit!",johnc_19

I just know everyone will have a GREAT time !,YardSaleLdy
50,Ride in Museum's Cars on Sundays,My husband and I enjoyed our visit to this fun car museum. The range of automobiles is excellent. Perhaps the most unique feature is the opportunity to ride in selected cars on Sundays. We live in the area so it is easy for us to get there but there is also an opportunity for travelers passing through LAX on a layover. The museum is about a ten minute taxi ride from the airport.,Debra-Lynne T
40,Great antique car museum,"We happened to be in the are so we stopped by the museum. There is no charge only suggested donations. Since we were visiting with small children and wouldn't be able to stay too long I gave less than the suggested donation telling them we wouldn't be able to stay so long because of the kids. They were very understanding and did not pressure us to give more at all. They do accept credit cards. The museum was very interesting. They have the cars in sections by the age starting with the late 1800, 1910s, 1920s, etc. It was interested to see. My son liked seeing the original prices of the cars. We had some questions and they were able to provide one of the staff to act as a guide for us which was nice. Here was very informative. There was 1 non-working car that they let the kids go in. If you go on Sundays they give rides in the local streets. I believe they said you need to be either 10 or 12 years old to get a ride in the cars.",amm101

It's not a huge place but has an eclectic collections of old cars. Admission is ""suggested"" at $5 each, which is well worth it. The highlight was the opportunity to take rides in the half-dozen vehicles they had pulled out of the collection. We rode in a Packard that once belonged to Joseph Stalin and a 1941 Cadillac. Fun!",badgergirl68

My daughter is totally into the old model cars, vintage looks, and this place has it all. The banquet room is very large, and the coordinator Jodie and her staff were very helpful and supportive. This turned out to be the party of the year for our daughter, she just feel in love with this hidden jewel!A must see even if just visiting the area, no cost for the museum, just asking for a donation, and you will enjoy the classics that they have house here.",Koollet4600
50,Unique and Special Experience,"My husband and I went to the Automobile Driving Museum as a meet-up with our local Smart Car Enthusiast group. I'm a Los Angeles native (36 years) and I'm still surprised when I find a local treasure that I've never before encountered.The Automobile Driving Museum is definitely a local treasure!To be honest, I'm not even all that interested in cars. My husbands is the one who loves them. I enjoy museums and doing activities with our group.The museum managed to catch and hold my interest.They have a great collection of classic and unusual vehicles. The showroom is set up in a way that allows visitors to get close to the exhibits. Unlike the Petersen Museum, you can walk right up to the cars and see all of the details. This was the first time that I really appreciated the elegance of classic cars.The best part of the museum is the staff. They were so welcoming and provided a wealth of knowledge. These people really love and know their cars!What makes this museum very special is that on Sundays, you can ride in a classic car. Our guide, Alan, took us for a ride in a 1948 Studebaker Starlight Coupe and a 1946 Packard Clipper. I had never ridden in anything older than the late 60's, so this was a real treat. I felt like I was filming a movie! The interiors were massive, with plush seats and tons of leg room. Alan was awesome, giving us insight into the cars.This museum is a real treat and a local gem!Like my review? Check out my blog!",Karen H
50,Oh WOW !!!! Do not miss this treasure !,"When we were staying at the El Segundo Marriott Courtyard in April, we noticed this place down the street. However, our schedule was so busy, that we had no time to investigate.This time, we were dog sitting in the area, and decided to check it out.This Museum is large enough to keep you interested, but small enough that you do not get tired. Beautifully restored automobile collection, which is beautifully displayed. We absolutely loved it. There are volunteers who know the history of these cars, and do not bore you with statistics, but impress you with their knowledge and interest and passion. Just ask away ! The Museum is a true feast for the eyes, and we are still talking about all the stunning and vivid colors of these automobiles. (You walk out on Sepulveda, and all you see are black, white, silver and beige.)Do NOT miss their crammed library. It is tucked away behind the small cafe. They must have every single book and magazine that was ever published about cars. The person in charge seems to know everything and anything about autos, or he can look it up for you. Much more fun to look at the actual books and manuals, then to ""google"" for information.Admission is by donation, and the suggested amount is $5.00 per person. That is a steal for the entertainment value you get out of visiting this museum.",NYU62
50,AussieBruvSis - Rare wonderful find,"A small museum hidden away , entry was a $5 donation, the quality of the exhibits was unbelievable and so varied.

50,nice sunday outing,the museum has primarily studebakers. They have docents working there and they are so knowledgeable. We were so impressed with the history and detail given regarding the autos.

40,Quaint museum near LAX,We visited this museum while staying at the Marriott and waiting for our flight. My husband is a huge car fan and I was quite impressed with the types of cars they had on display. The guy was very knowledgeable and it was interesting to hear the history.

50,An Unexpected Treasure Close to LAX,"I missed this gem of a museum last year as I only saw their gates on East Mariposa Avenue which were always closed. It turns out that the entrance is on Lairport. They have promised to put a sign on the other gates.I was really impressed with the museum which mainly has American cars and is something of a history of the US auto industry. I wrote a blog about my visit at: http://www,speedsportblog.blogspot.comI joined three other people for a very informative tour run by one of the volunteer guides. The place is staffed by volunteers and is a not-for-profit organisation. In addition to the cars there is memorabilia including a great collection of old petrol bowsers. There is also a library, second hand and new books for sale and a cafeteria. I spent three hours looking, photographing and talking. Great fun! I think that most Sundays they have some of the cars out and will take visitors for a drive. You can't get better for $5 in LA.",pierrekiwi
50,Really Friendly!,"I have been to classic car museums all over the world, but I could see this one was special as soon as I walked in the door. Rather than trying to gouge their vistors with a huge admission fee, they ask for a small donation. The collection isn't huge; there are around 80-90 cars on display, but is a good cross section of mostly American cars, with an especially nice collection of Packards. What really sets this place apart is the friendliness and enthusiasm of everybody working there. They obvously have a great passion for the cars and are eager to share this with their visitors. I was asked if there were any cars I wanted to know more about or to sit in (rare in a museum). Best of all, on weekends they offer rides round the area in a variety of cars. The drivers obvously enjoyed talking about the cars and really made the visit special.",DMC697
30,Disappointing,"We arrived right on opening time and they appeared not to be quite ready for customers. The whole time we were there only one person spoke to us and that was to tell us that we were in an area not open to the public (They hadn't got around to roping it off). Unfortunately the place was full of exhaust fumes which didn't enhance our visit. Maybe we just got them on a bad day? The place was also a lot smaller than it appeared to be on the web. However, if older cars are your passion you will probably enjot this place.",station

50,"Ride in authentic classic cars on Sundays and tour a unique collection of automobiles in the museum, Tuesday thru Sunday","I am very glad to have found the one-of-a-kind museum, on another website, listed under El Segundo attractions. Housed in a 27,000 square foot facility is a display of 150 rare and eclectic cars, depicting over a hundred years of auto evolution.Famous head of state cars include President Roosevelt’s and First Lady Eleanor’s 1932 Plymouth Town Car and Joseph Stalin’s 1936 Standard Packard 8. Another vehicle on view is the Heisman trophy winning football player, Anthony Davis’1968 Lincoln Continental with an autographed picture on the hood and his helmet on the car roof. See the car valued at a million dollars, a 1955 Packard Caribbean, that Howard Hughes gave to his wife, actress Jean Peters.Other notable vehicles include the 1942 Packard, a foreboding, hearse-like World War Two ambulance; the 1929 customized Packard Speedster race car, the only one ever made, and the 1904 Schacht Auto Runabout featuring high wheels, a wagon undercarriage. There is even a 1951Nash, designed to watch drive- in movies, while lying down, with fold down seats and a big, wide angled rear window. Many more beautiful and awe inspiring automobiles are on display.I strongly recommend taking a private, docent lead tour of the museum. The volunteer guides are car aficionados, who point out interesting features of each vehicle and facts not necessarily listed on the information placards. The docents also have access to the otherwise restricted areas and can answer questions. While pictures are allowed to be taken in the museum outside of autos, the docent must be present for photo opportunities when people sit inside guide selected cars.In the gift shop, is a replica 1886 Benz, before Mercedes, know as the first car to have an internal combustion engine and not run off steam or electricity. This motor wagon is an interesting combination of three wheels, which look like bicycle parts and revolving chain, a wooden wagon body with padded seating, a steering toothed rack metal bar, and an engine mounted on the back, in the open. The Benz had no lights, no brakes, roof or doors, but it is capable of a speed of approximately 7 miles per hour to complete with a horse, therefore; having a one horse power engine. This is the only replica in the entire building.Don’t’ miss the rare opportunity to ride in the museum’s cars on rainless Sundays. Joseph Stalin’s 1936 Packard has a smooth, sturdy ride. The 1982 DeLorean interior is made for tall people and while the seats are comfortable, the headrests are at the wrong height for short people. This car looks like the one in the movie, “Back to the Future”, which has a cosmetic, upwardly slanting unusable dashboard and gull wing doors. The 1915 Model T ran remarkably well for a car that is almost one hundred years old. The Tin Lizzy has a top speed of 40 miles per hour and at 25 mph the ride feels much faster in this car. The docent demonstrated the precision drive, turn-on-a-dime steering, of the 1989 Porsche 911 Speedster. In contrast, the 1940s and 1950s Plymouth and Buicks, luxury cars, glide with a “float” feature which rocks the car from side to side, like a boat.The rides start at 10:00 a.m. and end at 3:30 p.m., as the museum closes at 4:00 p.m. Check the website to see which three cars and correlating dates are available. Children must be at least 10 years old to participate in the rides. Each cruise lasts approximately 5 minutes traveling around a few city blocks. Everyone is required to sign a waiver before riding.In addition to the museum, there is also a research library filled with hundreds of books on cars, which is open to the public, during museum hours. In case you get hungry, hot dogs, ice cream, coffee, cookies, chips and sodas are available at the V 8 Grill snack bar. A large event room is also available on the premises. The gift shop currently sells a variety of mugs, bags, baseball caps, t-shirts, posters, magnets, polo shirts, hooded sweat shirts and car related items with the possibility of postcards in the future.All proceeds go to the museum and a worthwhile five dollar donation per person helps to sustain this nonprofit organization. Allow at least 20 to 30 minutes for the car rides and one hour to 90 minutes for a private museum tour. We look forward to riding in more cars in the future.The museum is housed in a large brick building, located in an industrial area, just one block east of Sepulveda Boulevard, with cross streets being Mariposa and Maple Avenues. The city of El Segundo is south of the West Los Angeles Airport and north of Manhattan Beach. The closest freeway is the 105. On the side of the building is a free parking lot and there is plenty of parking spaces on the weekends, when most manufacturing companies are closed.",catnewman
