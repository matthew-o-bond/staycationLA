50,Eaton Canyon - Nice hike,"Eaton Canyon is really close to DT Pasadena. Really pretty hike, but know that the last 1/2 mile to get to the waterfall is a bit challenging with multiple creek crossings. Water was ankle deep when we were there, so not a big deal if you don’t mind getting wet feet if you slip on a rock.",dcthomp3
50,Eaton Canyon,Family fun hiking trail. We went hiking with 4 children and they had so much fun. I would like to go at least twice a week.,Valentina z
40,Pretty Hike,"This is a very pretty hike but the most wildlife you will are humans, the birds are lovely but scared off by noise, why do you need to walk with music on a speaker?? The waterfall is pretty and it’s an easy hike.",GP1357
50,"Nice local hike, but really crowded","Great place to bring the kids with a nice waterfall at the end of the trail. You will not experience solitude on this pleasant hike through Eaton Canyon. Expect lots of people. Kind of like going to Yosemite Valley on a summer day. You will see lots of dogs on the trail as well. The trail crosses the creek a few times, and after a recent rain the creek can become really swollen and dangerous. However, it is usually shallow and you won't even get your feet wet.",rjuricich
50,amazing and fun hike!,Be sure to wear shoes you don't mind getting wet. I was so much fun. There is a bit of climbing to do but not difficult. Good place for the whole family to hike and enjoy nature!!,Esmie C
40,Beautiful hike,Beautiful place. Parking lot was full but we waited a few minutes and were able to get a parking once somebody left. It was definitely a pleasant experience. Easy hike. I did get my shoes wet because I lost my balance while walking on the rocks but it was fun!,carmen r
50,No waterfall in summer,We're so lucky to have so many mountains around the city with only a short drive to get there. It's summer time so the small waterfall doesn't have any flow of water right now. We hiked for four miles on an easy to moderate trail right before sunset. We found a small black tarantula on the way back just relaxing on the trail.,Creeping_Death_LA
50,Great hike,I finally tried this canyon near my house early in the day by 7am before you get crowds of inexperienced hikers. I prefer starting the hike up by the bridge where you don't have direct sun. Be prepared for lots of rocks and streams. If you are not sure footed get a hiking stick.,bbarnett12williams
50,Eaton Canyon Falls Hike,Length: 3.5 miles out and back Effort: easy Climb:436 feetParking: Park along side of the roadDogs: on leashThe waterfall here awesome for Southern California’s desert. The hike is easy and there are multiple trails in the area so follow the map. The trail is fairly flat and is a favorite of people in the area so plan on having others hiking with you. You also cross the river multiple times but there are stepping stones to keep you out of the water. I always wear my hiking sandals as I’m a klutz and its better for me to walk through than jump from rock to rock. –Besides then you can get into the water at the end without having to trudge back in wet tennies.See more at simonemcfarland.com,Simone McFarland Travel
50,Fabulous oasis,"Visited with a resident of Altadena on a Sunday afternoon, when it was quite busy. It is a marvellous opportunity to see a version of the desert, but brimming withe flowers and plants at the time of year we came.If you really want some seclusion, go at another time, but it's fascinating to see what the native countryside and adjacent mountains can offer.",Donald G
40,"Nice place for a walk, very nice nature center for kids","Spent the morning here looking at the nature center and some of the trails. Our group did not hike to the falls due to rain. Great small nature center for kids, nice walking trails. Also saw a nice equestrian staging area for horse riders.",rebecca d
30,Beauty ruined,"This is a tough hike, not real long (about 4 miles round trip), but it's tricky with about 8+ river crossings, plan on getting your shoes soaked. This trail is NOT for kids, it's very dangerous, but I saw a lot of people dragging their kids through here, it was a horrible site. Aside from that, people with dogs off the leash and graffiti covering the walls next to the waterfall. Defacing a natural wonder? wow...Low life's, it's tragic, would have loved to come back, but will not too much riff-raff.",Brian L
40,for trekking. so so,frankly.not bad but little bit boringthere's no many flowers but also little water and tame landscapes,정순 박
40,Eaton Falls,A beautiful hike with lots of tree coverage so you’re not baked by the sun. Because of the rains the stream is wide & you have to cross it several times but it’s worth it. Go early because it gets crowded.,Ltonti
40,Easy hike,"Busy place but easy hike. Great for family outing even a lunch picnic. The trail are well marked some graffiti. The water flow better after the rain. Wear nonskid hiking shoes and wise brim hat, not much covering.",Sugaylange
40,"Six days after rain, still your feet will be wet! But worth it.","So my type of hike is a lazy and clean hike. I didn’t expect to run into at least eight or so creek crossings that will drench your feet. Even six days after rain, the waterfall must have been flowing well and hence the creek is running strongly. I have to say though that I still really enjoyed it and didn’t think I would just come to accept hiking with mushy feet. We visited on 3/16/19 and think that the last rain was 3/10/19. I saw some parents with their little 4 week old babies in stow. I would highly argue that this is unsafe.Also hate that there so many self centered uneducated angelenos that blast their music into everyone’s ears with their portable speakers. Also this is the same population that is probably spraying the graffiti at the waterfall. Hoping educated Americans will pass severe laws to penalize those two things. Otherwise we still enjoyed it.",EuCy
50,"Easy, fun and beautiful!","My husband and I had brunch downtown and then drove to Eaton Canyon to walk to the falls. The walk is easy but due to all the rain, we did have to walk and balance on some rocks which for us was easy but thought we should point that out. The recent storms have made the stream strong and the sound is lovely. There are a lot of families walking together and lots of doggies which was really nice to see. The falls are small but it's a lovely walk. We timed it so we would be returning as the sun was setting and it was gorgeous.",Deniseka
50,Right After a Rainstorm is the Perfect Time to Visit!,"Having wanted to hike at Eaton Canyon Park for some time (or just about the entirety of my LA residency), my girlfriend and I took the opportunity to visit the gorgeous nature reserve after a near-weeklong rainstorm, meaning that the park’s featured waterfall would be in full force.A great idea, no? Well, it just so happens that half of Southern California thought similarly. However, as crowded as it was, it did not negatively affect our trip.We parked in an overflow lot and made our way to the trailhead. To the right of the park entrance is the Visitor Center (make sure to stop in before you leave, whether it be to look around, purchase a souvenir or to simply use the restroom). There are also porta potties lined up on the right hand side as you walk past the sign.From there, we encountered our first of many creeks for which a line was formed to cross. We waited our turn for easier passage via large submerged rocks and continued on our way.About ninety minutes (or one and a half miles) of beautiful views later, we finally made it to our destination, an awe-inspiring, gushing waterfall.Overall, I would only recommend this hike immediately following a wet spell. But also keep in mind that this does slightly increase the trail’s level of difficulty due to all of the creek crossing. However, it is most definitely worth it!",Adam Kassel
40,Great Walk and Some Climbing Experience,"A beautiful park right at the feet of the Sierra Madre, no entrance fee, good for level and mountain hiking. The nature path instructs on plants and animals in the area. There are facilities for a cookout and shelters. Parking area closes at 5 pm, but one can stay in the park longer.I ventured into Coyote Canyon, marked by a sign. The views I got overlooking the LA valley are impressive, especially at sunset (as one faces West). However, it is not possible to climb up in the Canyon to the end, as it is getting steep and, if one continues, actually dangerous. It would be good if the park posted a sign informing about this and not just indicate the name of the Canyon. There are instructions about all sorts of things (what one is to do and not to do), but the only safety instructions are given regarding the Upper waterfalls, nothing about climbing in the Canyons.Longer trail hiking is possible going up from the Walnut Canyon Trailhead, leading for various hours up to the Mt. Wilson Observatory.",Y8718GGandreask
40,take your water,"Nice walk, keep following the trail and when you come to the bridge, go down to the dry river bed then continue walking along. Not well marked. Very dry so take plenty of water and perhaps a snack to enjoy at the waterfall.",Roberta C
50,The hike to the waterfall was excellent.,There are lots of rocks and inclines and so this hike is not for the faint of heart. Wear climbing shoes and be prepared for them to get wet. Take it slow and enjoy the experience. Easily done in an hour or so.,Henry R
40,Worth the hike,"The first mile in is not too exciting and an quite an easy walk in, the next 1/2 mile is much more enjoyable. You will have to cross the steam several times before getting to the falls and the small pool of water it dumps into. The falls may be dry during to dry season, I lucked out and it had rained the day before and the falls was running good. Its about 40 feet tall and worth the trek in.",hfdad
40,Great hike - but don't expect to see waterfalls in autumn,"I hiked in this Canyon last week. I highly recommend it if you're looking to return to nature/get away from the busy city.Notes: because it has been so dry, the waterfall was barely a trickleMost of the signs are in poor condition (see pic below) so make sure you have access to the trail directions before you stop hiking. I accidentally added an extra 4 miles and 2000 foot elevation gainI read several reviews on alltrails about this being a shady hike, but if you hike it after 3 p.m., it isn't. Take more water than you think you need.Parking was plentiful and free.",1seethecityseethezoo1
40,Waterfalls in LA?!,"It’s only a short hike to the waterfall. I think 4 miles or less round trip. Go early in the morning 5am to 6am. It’s a popular place to visit and there’s tons of foot traffic. As with all natural places in LA it has litter. So if you visit here, and pack it in, pack it out. Please. Also in the summer time. Beware of rattle snakes so stay on the trails. I saw one last summer. Luckily they are more afraid of us. Regardless, stay back especially if they start to rattle.",Christophe H
40,Weekdays and mornings...,"We regularly hike the canyon either from the parking lot below at the Nature Center or entering from Pinecrest further up the route. Either way, on a clear day, the views are great of the SGV and if lucky downtown LA appears very clear.I would highly suggest hiking outside of the busier times like weekends and holidays otherwise you are guarantees to be with a lot of other people.Mornings are best for the coolness of the air and the sun is blocked by the mountains on many of the trails.Highly recommend to bring water.",_leland_
50,Great Hike Away from City Views,"This is a beautiful place to get outside and away from the city!Family friendly: YESThe trail does have a slight incline to it that little legs will need to take their time on.The path is not smooth so I would NOT recommend a stroller, even a rugged outdoor one.Pet friendly: YES (on a leash)Hats and Sunscreen: YES, The trail is not shaded for the majority (99%) of the trail.BRING LOTS OF WATERThere are clean, air conditioned restrooms available at the nature center near the paved parking lot.*There is a LOT of poison oak just off the path so if you stick to the trial, you will not need to worry*The nature center is a great little education station. They even sell little packets of sunscreen and bug spray in case you forgot any.FREE PARKING",Elle F
40,Accessible nature and hiking,"Easy hiking if you stay on the path, or more difficult if you climb into the wash and clamber on the rocks. The first waypoint is the bridge path that comes down from the street to the west of the canyon. That takes 30 to 50 minutes depending on your speed. This path is generally uphill with some more strenuous portions. Then you can take a stream hopping excursion to the bottom of the waterfall (another 30 to 40 min). Bring water. The initial path is mostly in the sun.",Howard A
50,Great Hike,Wonderful hike with a waterfall at the end. Sometimes the waterfall pool is deeper than other times we’ve been. The beginning of the hike is not shaded for awhile so it can be hot later in the day. Recommend going early. Once in the trees there’s shade off and on so much easier handling the California sun. Lovely hike we had on a Sunday late morning!,Cheryl Lyn R
30,Over Crowded,"Too many people & a lot of noise... I prefer a better hike w/ less people so that I might focus more on nature & my surroundings, not having to make my way through groups of people w/ children...It is outdoor hiking and over-rated.",Auntie-Nanuuq
50,See the waterfall,"Altadena's hidden delight, a shaded canyon with a year round waterfall and a shaded trail to JPL. Parking and overnight camping available, watch out for Bears.",Jim V
40,Nice for the Area,"If you are staying in LA and looking for some nature, head up to Eaton Canyon in the San Gabriel Foothills. There are several hikes in different canyons, but the most popular is the Eaton Canyon trail to the Waterfall. Parking is plenty and if the main area fills up, there is an overflow parking lot that is only a short walk away. The trail is nice and wide for the first mile or so. It is a sandy base and gets hot in the midday sun. After about a mile, the trail splits in a Y. Take the path on the left and you will go under a bridge. From there it gets more rugged and is slower going. You cross the creek twice, but there are stepping stones so you don't get wet. At this point you are surrounded by nature. At the end is the Falls that end in a small pool nice for wading if it is hot. I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone with a spare hour and a half that don't want to stay inside.",geomom01
50,Great little hike,Really nice hike the waterfall was more of a trickle but still really pretty! Well worth the time!Make sure to bring a bottle of water it gets pretty hot!,Ana R
40,Challenging hike that's not too long,When you arrive you can park on the street or drive in and hope there's room in the parking lot. If you go to the waterfall there is absolutely no way to get lost on the hike. People are coming and going (but it isn't crowded).The last half mile to the Falls is challenging: You're walking on rocks over shallow streams. Takes about an hour+ to get to the Falls. Definitely worth it.,Murgatroyd14
50,Be sure to follow to the end!,"Beautiful, scenic walk. Be sure to wear good hiking shoes and be prepared to get them wet! The hike can get a little rough in spots but be sure to follow the trail to the end for an amazing surprise. It is well worth it! Will go again when I’m back in the area (and the weather is a little cooler). If you go in the summer be sure to bring plenty of water",whc200
50,EZ Access To A Great Hike!,"With Altadena backed up against the foothills, accessing hiking trails is SO expedient and EZ! Parking: Free, as it's all street parking. BRING WATER!! Some people don't really THINK, as hiking these trails does task your system more than sitting in a great Pasadena restaurant sipping beverages! lolYou'll quickly (within 15 minutes) have GREAT views of the entire valley, and the hike to the top is SO worth it, mostly for the awesome view! The Boy Scouts and others keep the trail in GREAT shape, too. Please be polite and step aside for hikers passing.. This is a pleasant 3 hours or so!!",Mitch D
50,Great hike!,"Close to town. Easy to hike. A nice place for a picnic, there are a lot of trees for shade. At the end is a beautiful waterfall.",bkute65
50,Hike to the falls,"A nice easy hike to a wonderful waterfall at its end. A bit dry and underwhelming in the beginning until you reach the bridge and it becomes lush with a meandering stream, oak trees and lots of people especially on the weekend.",Henry S
50,Easy Hike,This is a nice area for an easy hike. We went on a weekday morning and it was a bit crowded with school classes.,Dominique
50,Great view,Great view and walk. Nice place for a date and to sit in the moonlight. But don't stay out too late!,Salvatore F
50,"It’s not big, but challenge.","Better go inside earlier, otherwise, out of canyon late, without light, it’s dangerous. There is a river deep inside of canyon. No road, you have to take shoes off and walk through the river like “z” way. Fun. Watch snake before walk to the river.",pldj m
50,Stream-Crossings and a Waterfall Payoff!,"Hiking the Eaton Canyon Trail to the waterfall is a must-do for Angelenos tired of the 405, 101, 10, 134 and every other congested highway we spend too much time on. This is a perfect walk for dogs as well, but be aware that it is very busy on the weekends with lots of large canines in tow. The walk to the waterfall is very pretty as the canyon narrows and the walls steepen. There is a stream which you must cross over several times (not difficult to do) which keeps things interesting, and the surrounding trees and foliage are lovely. Of all the hiking we enjoy in LA with our dogs-- Runyon Canyon, Franklin Canyon, Fryman Canyon, Hollywood Sign-- this is by far the prettiest we think. It is our favorite hike with dogs along with the Old Zoo at Griffith Park. Highly recommended.",Shelley R
50,Nice all-around hike,"On a recent visit to Pasadena, we had the opportunity to visit Eaton Canyon (after reading about it on Trip Advisor). We were not disappointed. It is a very safe, beautiful area to hike. There is a perfect amount of diverse terrain ranging from flat, even dirt to mild to moderate rocky terrain and a few water crossings. We found we were able to manage the difficulty of the rocky terrain by just scoping out our path. It starts off warm (we got there mid-morning) but when you get into the actual canyon, the temperature cools off as you wind through trees and shade while cris-crossing the meandering stream. We saw a total range of people walking, from obvious ""pros"" to family groups and even a few strollers (although I don't know how a stroller could make it through the rocky parts).Definitely take a water bottle with you. When you get to the falls, sit on a rock or wade in the water and just enjoy the serenity.We would definitely do this hike again. It was a wonderful way to exercise and enjoy some fresh air.",Melanie R
40,We have been going for decades,We are so fortunate to live right near the canyon. It has been so much fun to go with friends and family to do a quick hike to the waterfall. Great memories!!!,Cape-SoCal
50,The waterfall is still 1/4 full.. 🤣,"I revisited and am still very happy for us hikers are positive-thinking people... Although not half, the waterfall is still 1/4 full!! The left was taken in January and the right is mid October. Safe for solo female hiker. Round trip is about 1.5 hours without stops. No elevation and plenty of parking.",HappyGeekyWoman
40,Adventure into the Wild,We had an early evening stroll along the lower section of the canyon trail on a very hot and sunny day. Boy was the scrub parched. Views of the higher canyon walls impressive. Came across both a small lizard .... and also a small snake basking on the path in the late sunshine.,BobandJosie
40,Favorite Spot for Locals,"Start with the visitors center. Then a walk to the waterfall, crisscrossing a small stream bed that actually has water in it part of the year. Hardy visitors can access the Mount Wilson Toll Road (now for use only by the Forest Service) and hike all the way to the Mt Wilson Observatory. The hike to the falls is easy, and with adult supervision, accessible for children.",camusfan
40,Average Hike,"Lovely hike in shaded area which works out toward your favour. I'd advise to take bug spray though as we were bombarded by a lot of bugs. Apart from that, it was lovely!",Nas S
40,Favorite place close by to hike,Nice trails and the hike to the waterfall is well worth it IF you time it right. Our first hike it hadn't rained in a long time so there was no water but the second time we planned it after large amounts of rain (for this area anyway!). Gets a bit crowded on weekends so the earlier the better. Also much of the trails are not shaded so be sure to wear sunblock. Cute little museum in the information center that had some interesting exhibits and facts.,Tori L
50,good hiking,Great place to go hiking...nice waterfall and pretty easy to do the hike...Bring water and start early,travelshooter71
50,Nice hike,Nice easy hike. A few areas- moderate. Getting to waterfall was worth the hike. Nice views of the canyon. We passed two gentlemen volunteers who were picking up trash- ( they go each week) they even were carrying a ladder that was used to vandalize the natural rocks. Unfortunately - heartless people destroyed many spots along the hike with graffiti. A nice morning trip.,Ruthie A
40,Very pleasant for a walk or hike,"Visited Eaton Canyon with the GF and her small dog, did a hike up the trail toward the San Gabriels. Lots of interesting geology, some strange tree formations, great views of the mountains. The main park area has picnic tables, nice areas for kiddie play. Very enjoyable.",DonaldYokum
30,Not so easy,"read on tripadvisor this is an easy hike! I do not know the american standards for ""easy"" but for those working in an office and not going on weekly hikes, this is not easy at all. It goes up and down, you have to cross rivers jumping on stones, not to mention the heat. It is indeed a very nice hike but not so easy ... The waterfall at the end is very small.",Marie-Ange C
40,Nice easy hike to 50 ft waterfall,"Eaton Canyon is a favorite to take beginner hikers to see some S. CA nature.A hat, good hiking shoes & water are needed.",Pam T
40,Short and Easy hike,"A nice hike and sort of easy. Except the last 1/2 mile, you need to climb a rocky slopes. Along the way, you will need to navigate some creeks. It depends on the month, some may have more water than others. From the beginning, the hike is pretty flat. If you go early, most of the trails are shady. Don't go on the weekend, too crowded. Wear good shoes and maybe a stick to help you cross the creeks. Watch out for poison oaks. Ample of parking is you go from the Altadena pass New York Dr. entrance. At the end, you will be rewarded with a cool water from the waterfall.",Jim S
50,"For an amazing view of LA, take the hike to Henniger Flats","It's not an easy hike and not for everyone, but if you are in shape and out for an adventure, take the hike to Henniger Flats. Two things are required for this hike: time and water. The hike up is 3 miles which means the hike back down is also 3 miles. It's good to keep that in mind and to also realize that the steep hike down can also be hard on your legs. Once you reach the Flats you will find yourself in a pine forest with cool breezes and an incredible view. You will also find a wonderful campground and primitive toilets. Mind the signs: ""Beware of rattlesnakes"".And don't be intimidated by the many young people in training who will run past you as they jog all the way to the top.Go for it!!",PapaT0ny
40,"Nice hike, climb with great views of LA. Just crowded","We climbed up to Henninger Forrest today. The lower, flat trails were not great. Large crowds of slow and loud people (think boom boxes without headphones). Once we started the hike up the mountain it got dramatically better with great views of Pasadena, downtown LA and all the way to Century City. The crowds thinned out quickly. It was about 7.5 miles to top and back. At the top there is a wonderful pine Forrest with great views. Absolutely Brian sunscreen and tons of water.",Mikelemberg

50,We've been walking in Eaton Canyon for forty years!,"There are many entrances to the canyon with generous parking at the trailhead, and along Altadena Drive. On busy weekends parking might be a problem. Go early. There are many trails to follow....some along the creek, others higher up leading to Henninger Flats and beyond. Lots of dogs on the weekends all on leashes. Visit the Eaton Canyon Nature Center where you will find an excellent snake exhibit. It can get very hot in the canyon. Bring water. There are bears occasionally in the upper parts, and dear are fairly common. Great views of the valley as you ascend. Enjoy!!",David B

40,Easy and Difficult hikes,"I live close by so I come here often enough. Over the last 8-10 years, a lot of the hiking trails in the area have become very popular and unfortunately crowded. I drive by the parking all the time and there are many cars parked here every day of the week. Most people hike to the waterfall which is a pretty easy hike which will take you about 2 hours roundtrip. To avoid the crowds, there is an upwards hike near the bridge. It's a good hike with some views of the San Gabriel Valley area, but there is not much shade. If you take this trail, make sure to do it early in the day. Side note: There are people who are gravely injured or die every summer here because they decided to climb in areas with signs that say ""do not climb"". Don't be stupid unless you want to win the Darwin award.",Steve L
40,Eaton Canyon has changed.,Eaton Canyon seemed to be greener than ever.+Very crowded in 2017 (80's and 90's peaceful and not crowded)-Eaton Canyon Nature Center very informative and perfect for the kids+Some hikers carried their loud music on their backpacks. I felt it was rude for the other hikers that were trying to enjoy nature's sounds of birds singing and wind blowing through the leaves. --,preciadogeli
40,Good place to hike,"The place is pretty popular for people to hike, however I don't think this place is the safest, (not because there've been stupid people who doesn't have the best judgement and hurt themselves badly or require rescue) the path could get narrow and slippery with the dirt. Has nice view though, just have to be careful that's all.",Miumiu1985
30,Close to Pasadena but very crowded,Eaton Canyon is a beautiful place- the only problem is that a lot of people agree. I went on a Sunday morning and it was way too crowded. I found it difficult to get close to nature when your surrounded by herds of people. Recommend trying a weekday or off season visit.,Alicia S
50,Lovely waterfall with stepping stones crossing the way to it,Great walk to the falls. You had to cut across streams using stepping stones and branches. It was really relaxing and fun. You had to concentrate on your footing so this forces you to relax think and be in the moment. We had lots of fun watching people getting there trainers wet by accident. Glamour Photo shoot was happening when we were at the falls. Made us smile. Plenty of friends splashing under the falls having a great time. Real feel good day and some exercise. The photo isn't of me 😂,Safari606660
50,Serene trail,Large parking area and overflow parking at the nature center. It gets crowded on the weekends. Easy canyon trail with access up to Henninger Flat and beyond. The hiking trail to Eaton Canyon Falls is rocky and you cross over the river many times. Once you reach the end of this winding trail you see the falls cascading off the mountain.,Inoque1
50,What a find,"My husband and I love nature and waterfalls. We frequently visit Hawaii for that reason. We were so happy that Eaton Canyon, although not Hawaii, exists in our backyard. We took our three year old with us for the hike. The hike is 5.5 miles round trip. You cross many creeks filled with cold water from the recent rains. It's a nice moderate trail surrounded by beautiful nature. Everything is green and pretty right now because we have had so much rain. At the end of the trail you are greeted by a gushing waterfall. I will return with both my daughters in the summer with bathing suits so that we can swim under the waterfall. My only complaint about this place is the sensitive people on the trail that hold up everyone because they refuse to go in the water and get wet. Bring water shoes and be brave, it's just water people.",Hxa0063
50,Great if you love hiking and nature,"Located just north of Pasadena towards the San Gabriel Mountains is Eaton Canyon park. A wonderful natural escape from the hustle and bustle of modern civilization. A beautiful hiking trail is well executed leading to a waterfall at its end.

40,Hike to the waterfall,This is an easy hike a few miles to the end of the canyon where you will find a beautiful waterfall and pool to enjoy. Mentor through trees and over rocks. Northing difficult.,PilotMichael
40,Nice but noisy...,"The Eaton Canyon trail is obviously popular as evidenced by the number of people who visit. Not only is there a lot of foot traffic, but it is quite noisy -- some people even bring their own music and blast it from their backpack. So if you are hoping to be one with nature and enjoy the quiet beauty of the trail, this may not be for you. To be honest, I felt like I was at the mall. The hike itself is nice, with a few hills. The trail is wide the last mile or so is very rocky. It took us about 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the waterfall. Make sure you have good shoes (or have assured footing if not wearing trail shoes). I also recommend you stay away from the high cliff areas because rocks are constantly falling. In summary, beautiful trail and a challenging walk for beginners.",Traveling with T
40,Fun Hike !,"This is really a fun place to hike . We came twice, once in June and once last winter. Both times were really rewarding when we saw the large waterfall both in Summer and Winter months. One time we went with family members including a 7 year old and 8 year old kid and they had no problem traversing this trail . Although for some paths you will need to cross along the creek via a little rock hopping, it is fun for kids and adults as well. We found a summer time after a good winter of rain is most adventurous and fun time to hike here since you can enjoy rock hopping from big boulders and small boulders above a rush of water in some parts of trails. Come earlier in the morning since the trail and waterfall get very crowed mid day. Highly recommended.",MandC0218
30,Can get very busy,"Great hiking close to the city. Can take the dog and eventually reach a waterfall. Only downside is that it can get crowded, especially with those playing music from their phones or other electronics. I personally go hiking to escape that kind of stuff. I've also found people who are intoxicated or bums hiding off the beaten path. I do not feel comfortable hiking alone here.",Expertpacker87
50,Hikes that teach,Love this place. I can go myself and just wander about or take the grandchildren and get and give an education. The visitors center is a museum or sorts. Going there first gives one the highlights of what to look for while hiking in nature. We will also go for the longer hike to visit the water falls at the end. All in all you could spend and hour or a day at this wonderful place.,Erin C
50,Hike to the falls,We are all over 65 years and in good health wear good sneakers as you will have some rocks to climb over near the falls and when you return the incline at the end is a little steep.,ProudNanaof2

50,Great for hiking,"This is not only a great place for hiking , but offers both short and long hiking. You can bring the kids and dogs. and it is just beautiful.",pasadena4life
40,Our Hike to Eaton Canyon Falls,"Our hike to the falls in the summer of 2016 was a wonderful experience. The trail was worn and easy to hike on until the very last 15 minutes which required us to climb over some large rocks to get to the falls. The waterfall was small (because it was about 95 degrees outside) so it would probably be more fun to hike this in the winter when there is more water to play in at the end. Also, the trail is much longer than you would think.",MaryMargaretMcMertz
50,Great hiking place and fun family time,"We hike this park about 5 times a year. We usually come during all the different seasons. The park looks and feels different every time.From the parking lot at an easy pace with kids it may take about 45 minutes. 18-25 running with no kids.The trail has areas with shade and no shade. Bring water and sunscreen.Kids get to cross the creek several times, over rocks or logs.This is a popular hike so expect people. It is popular with locals as well.Worth the trip and the price is a nice water fall at the end. My kids always get wet, water is always cold. We bring snacks and sandwiches.There is a small nature center at the parking lot.",lxjuarez
50,A nice hiking spot,"Eaton Canyon is just a nice spot for a casual hike. There are a variety of different trails; inclines and descents are not terribly steep. Lots of beautiful native scenery. It's a dry area, so you see primarily California-friendly plants that are highly drought resistant. Lots of parking in the 2 lots inside the canyon, and street parking outside.",TrampingAuntie
50,Great place to hike,We hiked up to Henninger Falls. I believe it was almost an 8 mile hike round trip. It was great. The trail is smooth and there were a lot of people with small children doing the hike. It is very doable.,Csnana02
30,"Pleasant, But Crowded Hike/Walk","As other reviewers have shared, this easy hike can be quite crowded w/ not only lots of people, but lots of dogs on leashes. While walking on the main dirt road the various collection of hikers is quite entertaining to see, but when you have a back log at stream crossings, the number of guests can dampen your wanderlust spirits and make you think about cutting your hike short and turning around. IF hiking here, start early, or be prepared to meander your way. An hour walk will take you to a stream area that you can cross over a few times in a pretty, shaded area.There is a decent sized parking lot close to the trail head, 2 port-a-potties, and a few covered picnic tables. Strollers will work for a short stroll, but then the road narrows down to uneven, rock laden pathways.",overworkt
40,"Nice Hike To a Waterfall, But Footing Is Not Easy","This is a very nice 3 +- hour hike that ends at a waterfall. Most of the hike is not hard, but toward the end you have to cross a stream several times, and the footing going over rocks is not easy for those who are less agile. That being said, there are lots of kids and dogs, etc.",PrinceConsort
40,"Beautiful, but crowded on weekends","This beautiful canyon is only a few miles from my house, and I go here often with my dogs. It’s a perfect place to visit on a weekday in the morning, but be wary of the waterfall trail on weekends. It gets incredibly crowded, which has a real impact on your enjoyment of the natural beauty. If you visit, please be considerate and don’t litter! This popular trail loses much of its charm when inconsiderate visitors leave their trash lying about.The first part of the trail is a flat and easy hike -- great for families and seniors. If you choose to hike up to the falls, be aware that the last half mile of the trail is very rugged and requires going across (shallow) running water and climbing up some small rocky areas. Nothing a family can’t handle, but not recommended for anyone with mobility issues.",Kristin T
40,A great hike,"Hiked here to see the Lower Falls - a nice spot and an enjoyable hike. The trail is relatively flat, but as switches back and forth across the river, with many large rocks and boulders to scramble across. Not recommended for persons with leg/knee problems, and comfortable shoes a must!",Ice_D_8
40,Enjoyed our walk,We enjoyed our walk to see the Eaton Canyon water fall. It was quite a walk so make sure you take plenty of water. It would be nice if they added more signage telling you where you are and how far you need to walk to enjoy the waterfall. It had rained the day before our hike so crossing the creek several times can be challenging if you don't want to get your shoes wet.,kansas_traveler38815
50,Easy hike and fun family times,"This is a great spot to hike. Thete is plenty of parking, a nature center bathrooms. Once you star the hike you will walk for about 15-20 minutes on an easy trail. Few parts have shade. Then you reach the 2nd half of the hike. When you get to the bridge, follow the trail under the bridge. From there you follow the river/creek up stream for another 15-20 minutes. Most of this part is with shade. At the end you reach a beautiful waterfall. You can get wet, bring a backpack with snacks, sandwiches and drinks and just sit and relax. Please do not leave any trash. This place is popular on weekends. Low crowds during the week. Perfect for running, jogging or walking a pet. All pets must be on leash. $150 fine. Great place for even little kids. We have been taking outlr kids here since they are 2 years old.",lxjuarez
40,Easy & Scenic Hike,"I took a group of kids ages 11-20 years old on this hike. It was pretty easy and safe for them. There were a lot of other youth groups hiking (so no quiet time along the way) but it was still very fun and relaxing. It's pretty easy to make it to the waterfall, the water is a little cold, but fun for the kids. Bring a lunch and a trash bag to being your trash back with you. Will be doing this hike again soon. Enjoy sunny Southern Cali! ☀️",Marina V

40,Nice Hike!,"If you have 90 minutes or more and are somewhat physically fit, take this hike all the way to the natural falls. You will need to cross water on rocks for about half of the hike but it is worth it. Lots of people take this hike so start early to get parking and avoid the crowds.",dmgart

50,Don't Die on Coyote Trail;),"I just hiked this the other day, and it is a fun hike, though I did not make it up the the hilly part in the most conventional way. We took Coyote Trail, which is pretty short, but we decided to hike up the mountain toward the telephone lines and probably went about 100 yards up a 70 degree incline rock-climbing and had to turn around because it is pretty dangerous unless you are an expert rock climber (even then there isn't a lot to grab onto rock-wise, mostly soft packed soils and rocks that fall out of the soil as you climb). It was worth it for the view, but just be careful on the off-the-beaten-path trails. If I lived closer I'd be here ever weekend; it is a gem of a hiking area.",klindsied
40,Hiking Options,"We went for hike on January 1st, after the parade, the park was officially closed; however, we could park on the street and walk in. There were not marked trails, it was more a matter of deciding to follow the more, or less, beaten path. We chose a less beaten, it was a good width, and very steep with great views at the top. We then went down, crossed a bridge, liked along stream bed and made it to the falls. Even though there has been little rain, there were falls. The park was technically closed, and there were still quite a few people. It really is a nice park, the 4 instead of 5 rating is due to the lack of markings. The first trail was very steep, many would have had to turn back, and the directions to the falls were all from other hikers not signs.",IreneDJ2
40,Pleasant Hike With A Nice Waterfall,"Elevation gain is minimal as you walk up the stream. If there isn't a lot of water present you'll find it downright easy. If there has been a recent rain, many people will be stymied by the flow. Regardless, the waterfall runs year round. If they get that far, most people stop there. This is also a way to access the trail that goes up Mount Wilson, which is a pretty hefty hike or bike ride. Eaton is scenic and free, so it's highly recommended.",Dave N
50,Love it,Ok so first take either wet shoes or .. shoes u don't mind getting wetBecause u have to cross the little stream and sometimes u don't step right so u get your shoes wet .. there is lots of trails and if u love this stuff for sure u won't regret it the waterfall is so amazing,mayra o
40,Easton Canyon - Not the Only Place to Hike,"Sturtevent Falls, also located near Pasadena is an even better place to take a walk. Take the trail from Chantry Flats for an short, easy hike, except for the last 0.6 miles back to the parking lot which is all uphill. See everytrail.com for directions.",CrimeInParis1
50,"Fun, easy hike; crowded on weekends","Eaton canyon is a great hike that's interesting (not a long paved sidewalk) but not challenging, except for some stream crossings and a couple places you have to climb up a small hill. From the parking lot to the bridge is fairly flat, level, and kind of boring, but from the bridge back through the canyon makes you feel like you're miles and miles from the city. It can be quite crowded on weekends, and don't forget to bring more water than you think you'll need - it can get hot!",ennaidc
50,Popular Hiking Destination,"Very popular with hikers, I live right above the canyon so I see it year round. Be sure to stay on the trail and DO NOT CLIMB THE WATERFALL. I hear the helicopters very frequently making rescues of those that have tried. There have been many deaths, at least 1-2 every year so please don't risk it. Great place to hike as long as you play by the rules.",up2snuf
40,Easy hike with a great waterfall,"Weekend mornings are for hiking!What I like about Eaton Cyn Park is it offers you options. The contingency being your own skill levels and how much of a hangover you woke up with from the night prior.Some trails are fairly easy other than some creek crossings, and to those who have more gusto in 'em, Eaton also offers trails for the more experienced.Saw some some houses and cottages which I thought was a little strange.One thing that was evident was the abundance of doggies all over the place. Now don't get me wrong, I love pups of many shapes and sizes, but what I don't like is having to hot foot it because of the potential stinky mess that might get stuck on your shoe. Pick up after your dogs people! Just cause its out in nature, doesn't mean it's going to take care of itself!Best part is the end of the trail which leads you to a really gorgeous waterfall. Something about waterfalls that always brings about a certain calm. Ah I love it.",Rho K

40,Scenic trail for all tastes and abilities,"The Canyon provides a set of trails, from very easy (South gate to waterfalls) to quite complicated (several shortcuts on the mountain side). Please choose your path carefully: every year a dozen or so daredevils are evacuated from various points, unable to do that themselves.Park is open sunrise to sunset, but no one enforces your return even past the dusk (still it is really wise to pass the difficult parts in a daylight). Parking closes at 7 PM. North gate (closest to the waterfalls) closes at the sunset. Stepping away from the trails, keep close eye on the bushes and rocks for occasional rattlesnakes.",Ivan M

50,If you like the out of doors.,"I don't like to go on a hot day but cool days are nice. Hike the trails and remember to take at least 12 oz of water for each hour you will be out, even on cool days. One can stroll the grounds or take a serious hike up the side of the mountain.",Robert L
50,awesome mild hiking,"Unlike many hiking trails in southern California, this hiking trail offers plenty of shade on the way, especially once you enter the trail starting at the lower waterfall area. You see a lot of families with dogs/kids. On a nice day, it may get a big crowded and you may have to park pretty far from the trail entrance. You do have to climb some rocks to get to the main waterfall area. Overall, I love this trail.",jojo0215

40,Great hiking!,"There are two great hikes in Eaton canyon. The first day we took a wrong turn, the lack of signs and 1 vague map can be confusing for first timers, we were trying to find the waterfall but ended up hiking up Mt. Wilson.That hike is several miles up hill with amazing views.The waterfall hike is the complete opposite. Fairly flat and easy kid friendly. It is again hard to find, the path goes under the white bridge, follow that and you'll be fine. It was well worth it beautiful. My only complaint was the graffiti and the garbage. It's shocking that people just throw their water bottles on the ground at the bottom of such a beautiful waterfall.",holly w

40,Great Place to Hike - No Adventure Pass Required,"This is a great place to take a short or long hike. Start at the nature center and then hike up the canyon. If you hike far enough, you will encounter a bridge over the canyon. This would be a good place to make a circle hike by hiking up the dirt road to your left. Want a longer hike? Continue up the canyon to Eaton Canyon Falls.",TerrywHamilton
40,Find the Amazing Waterfall,"This is a beautiful California Canyon at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.There is a large free parking lot. You will also find a well maintained Nature Center near the parking lot with some interesting displays and even some live snakes.My favorite trail is the one in which you follow the water (stream) into the canyon. The reward is an amazing waterfall with a cool, refreshing deep water pool!One word of warning - watch out for snakes! This is rattle snake country!",James S
30,One of the easier hikes around Pasadena,"Around the Pasadena area, most hikes you take will end up being straight up a mountain. Eaton Canyon winds in between peaks to a small waterfall. Depending on the time of the year, you'll encounter a little lake--or about a bathtub's worth of water. The nature in the canyon is pretty and you'll be in shade for most of the hike. However, be wary of many ""river"" crossings which are hazardous not due to water but due to the loose rocks. Additionally, this hike is very crowded, so I'd recommend you get there as early as possible, probably 7 to 7:30 am.",Constance F
30,"Nice place for a hike, with water","I am sure that before the drought this was a great place to visit. Now that there has been little late fro four years, this sis not particularly exhilarating. Also the is the smog. As the hills capture all the pollution, which can be seen from the hotel, this is what you breath when you while here. I would recommend going else where for your health.",waiake1
30,Easy hike but crowded!,"We went here on Memorial day... expecting it was going to be crowded... so we got there around 4 pm. It was packed of people...The parking at the main entrance was full... but there is a larger parking off the New York drive.The upper fall is currently closed due to fatal accidents. We hiked the lower part only. It took us less than 2 hour round trip including stops for photo ops.The first part is pretty easy hike and has some shades. Once you pass the bridge, it becomes a bit rocky, passing some water creeks... then pass the water break. Everything becomes quite dry after that. It is another 0.5 mile from that point. We were a bit worry that there won't be any water flow because the water creeks are very dry... anyway, There is a water fall not roaring but there is water!It is however packed of loud people... so it is hard to relax.There is some trash on the way but not full of trash like some reviews mentioned.The park is closed at 7 pm. There is security/sheriff park in the parking...so it is quite safe.Overall, it is not a bad hike but I would probably not come back. It is better to hike Sturtevant fall which is a bit harder but less crowded!",kukulimoku
40,Great Hike if you want to get off the main trail and explore!,We took the path less traveled and found ourselves hiking a very vertical route to the top. It was the challenge that we were looking for as there many groups hiking on the main trail. The views from the top were spectacular and we chose to hike the main trail down.,dmcnitt
30,experience spoiled by urbanism,"I visited this place excited to see my first local waterfall. It was ere but along the way there was an unreasonable amount of graffiti.

40,Enjoyable Hike,I have hiked to many places but this was by far the best one yet. The area beginning with the town is a very nice place. I did not have a difficult time finding parking and I parked my car in the residential neighborhoods. You do have to be careful because there are signs saying you may not park in certain places on weekends. The canyon is beautiful with plenty of shade. I say this because other places I have hiked have none and it can be slightly draining for me after the third hour. It is a clean place with the exception of the graffiti on rocks that are scattered. The creek that leads to the waterfall is nice and the water is freezing but clear. It reminds me of Yosemite. It was an easy hike of about 3 miles round trip. The first mile is flat and there is a bit uphill but not too much. It is family friendly and child safe. There are two different parts to the waterfall there is a lower and an upper I learned that after we had left but we only went to the lower part. The only downside I can think of is of how packed the place gets. Otherwise I think its a nice family hike. There aren't very many waterfalls in Southern California being that we are in a drought so finding some like this one is a pleasant suprise. It was an enjoyable hike.,em74365
30,Nice walk in the wild,This is a nice place to walk and hike. There is a nature center and the trails are well marked. We saw deer. It is very popular.,Jay B
50,GREAT LOCAL GETAWAY,"Eaton Canyon is located at the northeast ""corner"" of Pasadena. It's a canyon with plants and a small nature museum that offers plenty of hiking paths to water falls, across bridges, etc. I love coming here on the weekends to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. It's so easy to get to because it's right in town, yet away from it all. It's a great place to have a picnic, go hiking, visit the nature center...or just sit and enjoy nature and the view of the mountains. Parking can be tricky on weekends, because the place is popular.",Tina C
40,Altadena not Pasadena!,"This great hiking trail is located in Altadena, not Pasadena, but that does not detract from its loveliness. But do go early unless you like your nature served up with a huge helping of humanity on the side.",CarmichaelVentura
50,For the Bird Watchers,"The third Sunday of every month is Bird Watching day. These hikes are lead by amazing birders who will share as much(or as little)information that you can process. The hike leaves from the Visitors Center, just inside the park. Get there a little early as the main parking lot fills up fast, leaving you running from the more remote parking to catch up with the group.There are several leaders who know the park well and will hike to the spots where the best birdwatching is, don't forget to take your binoculars, a watch list is handed out, bring a pencil and check off your finds. We were out for 2 hours and saw over 20 species of birds, including hawks and woodpeckers.Encourage your friends/family to marvel at the birds in your own backyard.I have found that I now walk looking up, listening for tweets and flapping wings.This hike has been my go to every third Sunday.",Wallaceneff
50,Enjoy the other option...,"The gate to Eaton Canyon opens around 7:30 so arrive early to avoid crowds and to snag closer parking. If arriving late, park in the huge overflow lot. Trail maps available on-line or in the nature center. The center doesn't open until 9am, but porta potties are located near trailhead.Everyone's destination seems to be the falls, but if steps matter, head to Henninger Flats with an elevation gain of approx 1600 feet! The path is on a dirt fire road and on a clear day you can see downtown Pasadena and LA! Once at the top, stop inside the visitor center and check out the diorama and artifacts. Before heading back, be sure to take a peek inside the old fire lookout tower. For more info on Henninger Flats, see write-up under Angeles National Forest.In summary, logged about 21k steps and 8+ miles r/t on exposed road. Tips: best during the cooler months; bring sufficient water; enjoy the other option!",Shimadog
10,Trash ruins the experience,"I usually hike to Eaton falls once or twice a year and every single time the tremendous amount of trash simply ruins my experience. It is just unbelievable that people leave so much trash behind! Countless plastic bottles, clothes and even used diapers (lots of them!). Trash is not inspiring and despite the fact that the trail is nice I can not possibly enjoy it because all I see is trash!Its always crowded with ghetto and extremely LOUD people. I love nature and love relaxing in nature but here just isnt the place for that.I always volunteer to pick up trash but honestly it is in vain. Even a local told me not to waste my time.The parking lot closes at 7pm and I was just minutes late because I was picking up trash. Guess what? I got a ticket! Unfortunately Im giving up on Eaton Canyon :(",rodito75
40,Nice easy hike,"We did the hike to the waterfall which was nice and relatively easy and saw people of all ages along the way.There can be some tricky spots along the way involving crossing streams by walking over rocks so be careful you don't get a wet foot like my friend did!The waterfall itself was quite small but still worth visiting, and we even saw a hummingbird on the walk back!Could be a bit better signposted at certain forks in the road but wasn't too much trouble figuring it out.Would recommend!",marenate
30,Pleasant walk. Go on a weekday.,This is pleasant walk/hike. All moderately uphill in. Last 1/2 mile involves a lot of rock hopping. 50 minutes to the falls and 30 mins back down. Lots of dog walkers. Large parking lot was full when I came down at 10 am on a Friday morning.,RuthMN
50,One of My Favorite Hiking Spots,"Whether you are a seasoned hiker or new to the concept, Eaton Canyon has it all. You can take the short hike from the parking lot to the first pool and teeny waterfall, walk into the big pool and waterfall, or hike the Mount Wilson Trail for miles to Mt Wilson. My only complaint is that there are no garbage cans once you get going and you cannot dispose of unsightly dog poo unless you bag it and carry it back to the parking lot.",karynrn52
40,Best done at full moon at the night,"Else it's crowded or too hot, often. You see LA lights at night, it's scary but still feels safe. If the moon's out, you can see the path lit up everywhere except under some of the trees, which adds to the adventure.",infinita29
50,"Beautiful walk, run, climb, hike.","You can definitely go at your own pace here. You can choose to walk along the path until it dead-ends, hike up all the way to the camp ground, or climb your way through all the way to the back where a beautiful hidden waterfall waits you. You may also see some propelling down the waterfall.Its a beautiful place to visit and just let your mind breath.",bfigueroa18
30,Eaton Canyon Falls Disappointing,"We had a beautiful fall day to hike up Eaton Canyon and the walk was good, but you hike the last half-mile over river rocks and boulders as the description indicates. However at this time of year (this year at least), the stream has dried up mostly and the waterfall is barely a stream.So, a good fall hike, but depends on your expectations at the end?",BogeyPeter
40,Hiking on the rocks,This is a splendid park for walking on a creek bed full of rocks in the shade of a verdant valley. The payoff is the modest falls at the end of the trail.,Scott M
40,Walk worth experiencing,"Taking 30 cadets up the canyon was a thrill, especially meeting locals out walking. Watch for pet owners who do not clean up after their pets, but the views were so nice, the higher you go the better. Only the serious make it to Henninger Flats.",Opie T
30,A hike to a waterfall you can't really interact with,"The hike is ok, it's not difficult, but there could be more shade during the first half. The view during the hike isn't anything special. The waterfall at the end is nice, but I wasn't satisfied because there is only 1 thing to see, it isn't amazing enough to stand on it's own, and you can't jump off of it unless you want to risk dying the way many people who have tried did.It's a good way to kill time if you live in this area, but I wouldn't make a trip out for it.",Craig
50,HIKE!,"So easy to get to the base of the trail. Park and get going! Moderately challenging with both uphill and flat trails. Not a ""loop"" trail, so just turn around when you have had enough. Great views within 30 minutes or so.",VeveK
50,Nice and Easy Hike,"The trail to Eaton Canyon waterfall trail is very easy. There are many other trails that you can extend to Henninger Flats. The trail starts in Eaton Canyon Nature Area, bathroom :-) Follow the trail along a typically dry creek bed. One mile of wide flat dirt trail which can be uneventful.... and plenty of sun along the way.After a mile, the trail to the falls crosses under a bridge and enters the San Gabriel Mountains. Atop the bridge is Mount Wilson Toll Road, this is the trail that can lead you to Henninger Flats. Once you pass under the bridge, you have to cross some streams. Be especially careful on this section of the trail, which crosses rugged terrain, can be slippery. This nice stretch is over far too quickly as the falls are just half a mile past the bridge.Since it is too short of a hike, I decided to continue to Henniger Flats (on my next review). Even they have 2 parking lots, it gets full easily on the weekends.Park Open Daily from sunrise to sunset • Nature Center Open Daily from 9am to 5pm",orcaandbeluga
40,Eaton Canyon,"I've hiked to the waterfall at Eaton Canyon a couple of times. The hike is fairly easy, especially enjoyed crossing the streams. Although crowded during the weekends it's still nice to get away from the city. The hike is made better by how much shade is along the trail. However, the beauty of the place is ruined by trash, in particular dog poo, and graffiti. Who really hikes all the way to the waterfall and tags the rock wall next to it? Overall still lovely.",madhatter_cad
50,Nice place. Hard to believe this place is so close to la.,"Love it. My kids are still a little young for this place, with the boulder hopping and all, but I can't wait to take them.",Mark W
30,Nice Vigorous Hike,"We hiked alongside the stream to the waterfall. One member of our group had the foresight to get a map at the visitor center before we took off. Probably would have been okay without it, but better safe than sorry.The trail is flatish and very easy for the first half mile. After that, there are several ups and downs and stream crossings. There were no bathrooms along the way, so the modest should take care to use the porta pottys located at the entrance. It's likely that you may get a little wet in the multiple stream crossings, especially if balance is not your strength. This hike is also not suitable for small children unless they are harnessed into a child packing apparatus and you are prepared to carry them. If you can, it's best to visit during the workweek because the crowds are less likely to an issue. Signs directing you to overflow parking are a good indicator of high crowd levels.The magnificence of the waterfall is dependent on the recent rain fall. Our local hosts informed us that there were several inches of rain earlier in the week, so we were in luck. Several people elected to pack picnic lunches on the hike and eat in front of the waterfall. We passed a very young couple on our way back from the falls, where the young man had taken the picnic basket idea literally compete with a baguette. IMHO, a backpack is much better suited for this type of activity.Some small children with parents lacking common sense were wadding in the frigid water at the base of the waterfall, but for the vast majority of people swimming will seem like a bad idea. Start to finish this little jaunt took approximately 2 hours. If you plan to go, sunscreen and adequate water are a must.",cococobb
40,Difficulty: easy,"I have been here to EAton canyon few times. The trail is very easy. Your toddler and small dogs won't have any problem exploring the trail. The waterfalls is OK. But if for a beginner hiker and wanted to see waterfalls at the end, this is the place for you. I'm disappointed for the other hikers who leaves their trash behind and other irresponsible who vandalizes some trees and rocks with spray paints.",RexrayPhotography
50,My first experience here!,"My daughter and her girlfriend asked me to go on a walk with them, but I never imagined our walk would be so adventurous. This 3 mile hike was filled with running rivers, some rock climbing, balancing across waters, beautiful scenery, awesome photo ops and a beautiful waterfall at the end of the trail. Not being an experienced hiker or even walker, I thought I wouldn't make it all the way to the waterfall and back, but I sure did! I felt proud of myself by the time we were back at the car and would definitely try it again! Take some light food and water with you because you're definitely walking through the wilderness all the way through.",irtorres
50,"Wow, what a view",Great canyon and exellent walking paths. This was something I happened to stumble upon and was glad that I did. It is worth the trip. And the best thing is it's free.,Austin916
40,My neighborhood hike,"Pleasant hiking trails in a corner of LA county that is about as wilderness-y as the area gets. The paths aren't too challenging (mostly) -- we've been bringing little kids and dogs for years. But you do have to be aware of the stream if it's been raining, there's no guarantee there's an easy way across. And rattlesnakes are always possible, so watch the kids and pets.",Jimverbose
40,Good for hiking,"It is a nice place for hiking. It is not extreme. Go prepare: hiking boots, water and nutritive snacks, as well with some friends. Keep on the trails.",Itsia
50,Fun and Easy Hike!,"This is a great place for a hike! The trail is not difficult, and it's fun crossing back and forth over the stream. The falls are always refreshing-perfect for wading on a hot day.Sometimes the trail is crowded. If you go on a weekend, be prepared to see lots of families and groups on the trail. Weekdays are more quiet with more freedom to really enjoy the peace and solitude of being outdoors.There is a huge parking lot, bathrooms, and a nature center at Eaton Canyon, as well. Great outing for individuals or families!",Meredith B

40,Very nice urban hike,"Eaton Canyon is conveniently located on the north edge of Pasadena. A dirt-trail 1 and1/2 mile hike leads to a 60 foot waterfall. A nice, small visitor center/museum is located at the trailhead, with lots of free parking.",bverbos

40,Great Hike!,"Can't get better than having this in your neighborhood... plenty of trail options so you can choose just how hard you want to work. Only problem is it gets pretty packed on nice days, hot days, and weekends.",Emily A
40,Nice hike and not too demanding,We went all the ways to the falls. This isn't a demanding or technical hike. I saw people of all shapes and sizes doing the trail. There are a few places to stop for a snack or picnic. This whole area is great for jogging. Take this in if you are in the area.,RADARSHE
50,Great Hike,Great Hike and beautiful view for what it is. Not to tough of a hike.,ostokes
50,Eaton Canyon Hiking,Great hiking in this area. Hiking up to Henninger Flats can be easy or strenous depending on your speed. Give your self a little more than an hour if you park in the lower parking lot. When you arrive at Henninger Flats you will find the Ranger Station & water fountain.,diverdownfbh
40,Eaton Cnyon review,"There is a trail to the fall, also it is a little shade, but the trail is well maintained, I enjoy to walk on this trail. There is exhibition on the premise. it is good for ther kids..",chien C
40,Get your hike on!,Great nature preserve for the new to advanced hiker. Do be carfeful to stay on the marked paths as hikers often get stranded at higher elevations and there are rattlesnakes that are often spotted here. The kids will like the nature center and the waterfall is worth the hike. Enjoy!,bgrrl
50,What more can you say..... GREAT place for hiking,"Yes, what more need to say for Eaton Canyon, free parking, great place to hike and friendly hikers!",kitty-hello
40,Low Key in the Canyon,"Eaton Canyon has fairly good parking, a nice small visitor's center, and well groomed paths near the parking lot. It is a nice place to go with a young child or for a short nature walk. Beyond the Visitor's Center area, hikers can take their dogs for an adventure that includes an interesting stream and then continues up the mountain.Good for all levels of fitness and outdoor interest.",Traveler103
30,You have to get back into Canyon....,"it's quite a walk to get back through the wash to the canyon itself...then it can be pretty nice. However, usually really over-crowded, especially weekends, and consequently often trash along trail.",cvcalifornia
50,Like being a champion,"Right before the last sharp turn towards the first lower waterfall, there is a trail that involves some serious upward rock climbing. This leads to a beautiful hike trail leading up wards from one waterfall to another and another. Each presenting us with a different strategy on how to climb further and further. It's like a hidden paradise. Things get greener, the water gets clearer, the ground gets softer. Wonderful.My suggestion for the best parking is to avoid the main parking lot. It causes you to have to walk further in the sun by almost an hour more. Thus, taking away from the time you could be spending within the paradise area and in the challenges of the extreme hike if so you choose to go down that path.The best place to park is to take Altadena Dr. straight up towards the mountains. About a couple miles up from the freeway you will see it curve to the left. Arrows are places on reflectors here. Following this in a residential area to your left and the mountain and the road fence to your right, you will see on your right side a small little dirt parking area across the street from the residential. Park there. There's an opening in the fence here with a trail made just for those coming from this lot. I usually park here or across the street in front of the houses or in the lot. by the houses are better because we all take off our shoes and socks and rest of our wet clothes when we get back. After a 5-6 hour hike through water and dirt, you want your feet to feel air again.",Pastfloydart
