40,Not bad,"Nice place to walk around and relax. I wouldn’t go out of my way to go here but if I’m the area, certainly worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slidermuzz
40,Calm,A big park in Los Angeles.Here are a beautiful pond and for sure a lot of different birds. On the downside are the homeless people. No danger but still.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Highcoaster
30,Average park,"MacArthur Park is south of Hollywood Blvd and isn't worth the effort, its an average park and looks like it could do with some tlc in more ways than one, brief stop on our tour of LA didn't seem attractive enough to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
20,STAY AWAY if you have kids and definitely not a date,"It's unfortunate because the park itself doesn't look too bad. However, its PLAGUED with homeless people and drug addicts and it reeks. I don't give a damn how politically correct people want to be, this place attracts trash. Come here during the day, check out the tunnel murals (which are pretty neat) and walk around a bit. Whatever. Other then that, there's just so much more to see in Los Angeles. Definitely not a date spot or family friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanBigBossMan
30,Walked around at night,"I chose to go for a walk in MacArthur Park around 9 pm on a Saturday. Yeah it's filthy, and there's plenty of homeless people, but nobody bothered me. Even took the underpass. There were also plenty of people just hanging out, playing... It was alright. Just sad to see the pond so dirty, and the park in general. Used the outdoor workout equipment, that was fun. Lots of ducks / geese.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassemPrime
20,Nice view of the city if you can stomach it,"You can see the classic view of the city rising above the lake but I wasn’t able to do it without being hassled by the homeless. Doesn’t seem dangerous during the day, just irritating, including lots of rubbish and bird excrement. There’s a metro station next to it so easy for a quick look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
20,Not a family park.,"Don't want to be too critical but unless you're homeless, looking for drugs, a cop or really, really brave...don't go there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bev_and_Katie_travel
40,From the song in the 60's,"Always wondered if there really was/ is a MacArthur Park and now I know yes, there is. Good view of the park from our open hop on hop off bus along the route",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chaunceys2016
20,Appalling,"After lunch at a nearby deli, I wanted to take a walk around the MacArthur Park lake in a misguided attempt to indulge pangs of LA nostalgia. Sadly, what should be maintained as a neighborhood showpiece stands as a shameful example of city neglect. You'll find no fresh air in this once-beautiful park, only the putrid stench of human waste and stagnant water. The parks administration has clearly abandoned this property as there is no evidence whatsoever of any upkeep of the facilities. If any sanitation regulations exist, nobody's enforcing them. Garbage and filth are everywhere--in the grass, in the water, along the walkways. . . The local residents deserve better. The homeless people camping out there deserve better. *Heavy sigh.* Although I doggedly insisted on circling the entire lake, I recommend a visit here only to those involved with social services or charities who may want to help some of the denizens congregated in this park. A Korean Christian group distributed lunches while we were there. The church members walked the lawns and roused people from their naps for a midday meal. That was very heartwarming to see. After our stroll through this environment, my sheltered, suburban adolescent son certainly had his eyes opened about the living conditions that some folks have to deal with. A daytime field trip to this venue could be beneficial for a local kid with a case of ""affluenza.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Square-on-Wheels
20,Neglected,"Well it may not be melting in the dark anymore, but it has been neglected for many years, even though it's in the middle of the city. Was once full of drug dealers and a bit sinister. Could be gorgeous and important.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
20,Stay away,"Our uber driver warned us to be careful here, we kept clear of the numerous homeless and the park isn't in great condition and garbage but OK for a walk. We quickly went to the Metro station located here and left..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grommet22
50,Great!,"Super nice park!lots of shady and crazy people who smoke crystal meth.we met a homeless Mexican on meth.he showed us around the neighbourhood.a funny guy :)after an hour of guiding us, he pulled out a Stanley knife and after that we took the subway back to our hotel in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonnyp2018
20,Tent land for homeless,Very run down and now a tent land for homeless people all around it.Very degraded and needs major cleanup.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwe003
30,Would Be Nice Park If Just Maintained A Little Better,I grabbed some lunch across the street at Langer's and made my way over to sit in the park. It's small but offers a handful of places to sit. It's a pretty cool park. It's just not maintained all that well. Lotsa of trash and duck poo all over. The city really should work on cleaning things up a bit. But it still was nice enough to be able to sit there for a little and enjoy my lunch and some people watching.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
20,The smell,Went here more as something to do with seeing something similar to it in GTA and I was going to Hollywood on Metro Line so I thought I'll see it in person. Basically something for every sense but not really in a positive way. I was there about 15 minutes to get a few pictures and then left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SkyCommander
10,No. No. No. No. You Could Get Hurt. No. No. No.,"It is really sad that MacArthur Park is such a dump, but it is. Stay away. It has a lake which has been cleaned. There are little boats that you can rent for the small lake. You can bring lunch and picnic under a tree. It all sounds so lovely.While you are there you can also get meth, coke, crack, fake IDs, stolen property, mugged, harassed by the locals that hang out there because they have no where else to go.I have lived here all my life. Trust me. Stay away. I will let you know when it is safe.Stepping on a dirty needle and getting a disease is not my idea of a fun vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,. . ..needs the attention Echo park lake got,"Grabbed food from a food truck at the end of Ciclavia at MacArthur Park. the City of LA cleaned up Echo Park and made it a much nicer place , this place should be next in line. Wouldn't have stopped here if not for Ciclavia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV
30,Closest you're going to get to Nature by downtown,"Lived by MacArthur for a while now and it still takes some time getting use to it.Pros- nice track around the lake for exercising purposes, ducks and pigeons to fill your hearts content, 99 cents storr, mickie d, yoshinoya, langers across the street if you want to snack before chilling, nice geyser in middle of lake, and depending on the time of the month, you might catch a fair. Also nice tunnel full of graffiti that takes you to the other side of the park that has a stage and soccer field.Cons- Home to a lot of homesless people and addicts, I normally go during the day (not at night)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y4576RDjaneb
20,Giant Beachballs,The lake was filled with giant beachballs when we got there which was a fantastic sight to see. Unfortunately we did not feel safe and the smell was pretty bad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaaaayyyyyeeeee
30,Nice to know,"If you have some time to kill and are crossing through the area, make a quick stop to see the spheres at the lake. The park has a lot of homeless and it feels a little decayed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTorre
30,Slightly run down but still worth a visit,"Iconic and famously in the song MacArthur Park is not in the best shape these days. The surrounding area is run down a bit and a lot of people seem to live and sleep around the park. It is also full of brightly coloured large ballon like orbs which move around with the breeze, these are a spectacle in their own right. So if it is on your list do visit but be aware it may not live up to expectation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U6003AQjohnm
40,Special Art Exhibit Near Downtown Los Angeles,They cleaned up the park for the Spheres of MacArthur Park Exhibit. Worth seeing. It is usually a hang out for the homeless. It's so good to see the old park with a new look. It looks like a lake full of beach balls with flowers painted on them. I like the flowers though.Take pictures! It's so colorful! I see it every day on the way home from work. Right across the street from the MTA Purple or Red Line Train. Parking is a problem. I suggest taking the train. Be careful in that area though. Don't roam around too much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw353
30,Spheres of MacArthur Park 2015,"The recent art installation of MacArthur Park brought us out this morning to see it and the surrounding area. I have lived in Los Angles all my life. Even though something is right in our back yard we should not overlook it. Get out and see your city. AND when there is something special, like an art installation, go visit now!Afterwards lunch at Phillipes is a nice stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538pamelas
10,Homeless Park,"The park STINKS ! Bird craps, human feces, beer bottles, garbage pile, trash bags you can find them everywhere. This park was neglected . The Life size statue of Gen D MacArthur ( hero of the Pacific War ) is so dirty. Water is colored black because of the litter that polluted it. I want to rate this as negative but there is no category that is less than zero. A lot of homeless people. The air smells like a dead rat that has been rotting for days. This is the first time that I went to a park and vomited. UNBELIEVABLE ! Never seen a park so dirty in my life. DO NOT GO here. Please see the pictures I took.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
30,A mixed bag,"I think it would be hard to relax here and is definitrly another area to avoid at night. I had to frame photos carefully to avoid those sleeping rough - and I went at 1pm!Lots of poor people in the area, possibly drawn by the 99c Store.Park undergoing upgrade works at the moment. Back side of lake has good views to the financial district.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
40,"Lively, inviting, friendly, and fun","I ran to, and in, MacArthur Park with some initial concern. I'm a runner, and Mac Park was only a few blocks from my hotel; but the running websites had more than a few warnings that one could feel uncomfortable at best and threatened at worse. Maybe I just happened to hit it on a couple of good days, but my misgivings vanished in a flash, and the lively sights & sounds of the park truly energized my running. However, I suppose someone who's white like me and has little or no experience of deeply urban life and perhaps being the only white anglo in a big crowd may nonetheless feel uneasy. Yes, there are the homeless and yes, park staff have to scramble to keep the facilities presentable. But these are the facts of U.S. urban inner cities everywhere. Mac Park is clearly cared for, I was bothered by no one about anything, the families with children playing soccer were everywhere ... as were water birds of every size and description. And if you, like me, happen to be an aging Boomer, this is the ""don't miss it"" location of the 1968 incomprehensible monster hit ""MacArthur Park."" Before you die, don't you want to stand on the very spot where the ""sweet green icing was flowing down""?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desrlmt
40,Beautiful oasis for an after lunch stroll,"Very pretty park. Birds. Island and fountain. Enjoy it with the veterans and every one from the neighborhood. On a sunny day with a belly full of Langer's Pastrami you have to get out and walk and visit the statues, especially the one dedicated to Douglas MacArthur.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillipJalowiec
50,This park brings back good memories ❤,"I met my boyfriend back in 2011 & we both live in Norwalk . while roaming the city of LA , we ran into this park & stepped out. It has SUCH a beautiful view of the city over a huge lake ❤ this is the only reason why we come here is to enjoy the view & take pictures & feed the ducks & geese but over the years it changed. Now the park is filthy and trashy and smells like pee everywhere & there are bums sitting there drinking. Now we don't even like going there when we come to LA now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dessiiboo
20,Don't come here if you don't have too,"I've lived around this park my whole life and it's not a place I would recommend to anyone coming to LA. The park is dirty, the water is filthy, and you'll find illegal activity going on inside and outside the park. There are better parks in LA so don't waste your time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blaugrana10
