50,The Music Man Play,What an amazing performance by the Theater Experience of Southern California. The theater is beautiful and so historic. It has hosted so many people and performers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyayersrdcs
10,Shen Yun,"Let me preface this review by saying my husband and I have never walked out on any show, and we have seen many. Also we have never written a review for a show afterward. At first we thought that the show was going to live up to its hype… No way! Except for the costumes, which were very pretty. The show was very amateurish. I felt like we were at an elementary school show. The show also promoted propaganda and religion. This should be advertised with the show, to let people know what they are paying for, Tickets are pricey.Now the theater and the operations of the parking.They had a shuttle coming from the parking lot that took forever, As all the parking lots were full near the theater. We waited about 40 minutes for our shuttle on a very long line. There were many people that were disabled on our bus, my husband and I are older as well but we are able to get around fairly well. When we finally arrived at the theater, the men at the doors Kept saying hurry up hurry up the doors are going to close. When we got in the theater it was black dark. We were not able to go to Our seat even though the show had not started until the curtain closed. When it did close, the usher taking us to our seat sped ahead of us with a very small flashlight that had no light. The aisle to our seat was pitch black. I just had a knee replacement, I’m surprised I didn’t kill myself. The seats at the bridges auditorium did not have much of a pitch and I couldn’t see that much, unless I moved my head from side to side.By intermission my husband and I had had enough and walked out. It was our anniversary and we really thought we were going to enjoy a very special show in a nice theater. I don’t want anyone to go through what we did so that’s why we are writing this review. The show was very disappointing and the set up of the theater was very dangerous, And the parking situation was terrible.I would like to commend the Leticia from facilities. She was kind of nice and took us back to our vehicle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nannymokey
20,Ugly,"This Pomona College auditorium is not just old, it's exceedingly ugly. It is, however, convenient for the college's students, and there is relatively convenient parking for visitors. Good accoustics. Uncomfortable seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
20,Shen Yun,"I have been planning to see Shen Yun for years after seeing the billboards and commercials. The Shen Yun performance was European ballet modified to tell tales of Chinese mythology performed to classical Chinese music. The main theme was how Communists ban and torture Falun Gong practitioners. Shen Yun is seriously promoting this belief. The Dunhuang Erhu or Chinese 2-string Violin performance was the best parts of the show. Half the stories told involved martial arts battles and the performers clearly had zero martial arts training. Moves were so repetitious from dance to dance the only difference was the change of costume. The singing was the worst part, all political with little to no vocal quality and extremely loud. This show went all out to make the crooked Communist Chinese government the bad guy beating up on the Falun Gong. There was a computer animated backdrop that the performers regularly interacted with. The animations were very rudimentary with quality you would expect to see in a middle school talent show. All this for $150.00 a seat plus tax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyNest
