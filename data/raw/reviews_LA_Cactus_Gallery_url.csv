50,Cactus Gallery worth the trip,"Whether you are a visitor to Los Angeles or a long time resident, a trip to this small, artisinal gallery will be worth your while. Featuring original art, pocket sized to wall sized, of local emerging artists this gallery has an abundance of cool things to look at. Located in an area affectionately nicknamed ""Frogtown"" due to its proximity to the LA River, this neighborhood is adjacent to the York Avenue arts corridor which is the hub of the brilliant North East LA monthly art walk (http://nelaart.org) every second saturday. Also, keep your eyes open for the Frogtown art walk (http://www.frogtownarts.com) during which other galleries and art spaces in this neighborhood open their doors, local bands play, and the residents, young and old, all get out in the street and boogie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahCalifornia
