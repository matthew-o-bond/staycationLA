50,Incredible views & worth the effort,"This is a difficult trail, you need to be in somewhat good shape to hike, but you hike all the way up to the summit and when you get there you can see the ocean on both sides of the island. Incredible views as you hike and once you get there. Bring plenty of water and be patient, it will be worth it. It took us a about 2 hours to hike from Avalon. You go through the Wrigley Memorial & Botanical Garden and pay the $8 admission fee at the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luism896
