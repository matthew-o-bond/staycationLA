50,A dogs paradise!!!,"My boyfriend and I decided to do a 9 day road trip with our large breed dogs from BC, Canada. When we rolled into California we started researching a place where we could let the dogs really have fun after just being allowed road side pee's for the last 24 hours. My dogs went bonkers with excitement. The waves arent too rough. I didnt find there to be undertow. The sand was soft and the dog section was pretty bid. There were tons of dogs there to socialize with. I saw one altercation but most nice dogs.There is fresh water up at the bathrooms near the parking lot.The parking lot was a paid lot but I remembering thinking the price was very reasonable.It was so great that when we looped by thru Long Beach again on our way back North we stopped in with some chairs and picnic so our dogs could really get tuckered out.",Allisonj7

50,An LA County rarity!,Not many beaches that your dog can run free in LA area so this is special. Best to avoid weekends if you can.

50,Our spot for our dogs....an we drive a long way to get here,Not many places you can take your dog to the beach legally in LA. The only other spot I can think of is in Huntington Beach and that is even farther south from us. This is nice place for dog fans to meet other people of the same ilk. Dogs can race up and down the beach and into the water. It's relatively clean....as clean as a dog beach can be. Its rare you walk into poop just sitting there. Most ppl are good about cleaning up. On a sat/sun during the day there could be a couple hundred ppl there with dogs. If you dog can be socially anxious best have them on a leash at first bc it can be overwhelming for them. All breeds are there too....from yorkies and great danes.,John R

Off to the side is a people beach (which I was going for) but the dog owners don't seem to respect the boundary very much and wander over on the people side.

Watching them meeting new friends discovering the water and going around making new friends was so relaxing. Warning, this is a DOG beach. Expect dogs to come over and greet you, walk on your blanket, stick their face in yours, sniff your food and run around kicking up sand and shaking water off on you. I loved this!! If you don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt go. If you do go that is on you not the dogs or their owners.",Missy M
50,Worth Driving through LA Traffic!,"Our beloved service dog was diagnosed with bone cancer. Our trainer had always asked us to stay away from dog park areas because of the potential for aggressive dogs to injure our dog. What we went through to get a credible and amazing service dog was incredibly difficult and since this dog was doing his life-saving job we never wanted to take any risks with him getting injured. However, he LOVES water and LOVES to play with other dogs. I wish we had taken him sooner, because all of our fears about aggressive dogs were unfounded. All of the owners are respectful and our dog had the best time romping through the waves. This beach made Red so happy he seemed to not feel his cancer pain for many days after our beach trip.Parking is easy.Bathrooms are nearby.Beach was clean.People were friendly.Dogs were friendly.Wish we had our dog to go again.",M.R.
30,Excited and scary. Be careful.,"We are visiting the area and looking for dog friendly location to let the dogs stretch their legs and run. We were excited to learn about Rosie‚Äôs and drove by the night before to check it out. It looked great. The following day we took the dogs to Rosie‚Äôs, however, once we walked to the waters edge to walk the beach were surprised by the amount of trash on the beach. Very sad to see all the plastic, straws, wrappers, and glass. But the scariest part was when we came across hypodermic needles in the sand! We had removed our shoes to walk. The park is great but owners need to show some respect for the park and clean up after their dogs. We came across multiple droppings that owners had not cleaned up. I hope this place will be around for the future dogs and owners but some TLC and caution will be needed by those that visit.",DFW_NRGTX_Traveler
50,Great place,"Mum was missing her dogs whilst we were on holiday so we took her here, I wish we had places like this.Although the toilets were very very dirty as they seemed to be all down the beach. We also noticed some poor ladies handbag on the wall near our car with contents across the floor, it wasn‚Äôt there when we arrived but was when we left, we tried to find a policeman or some security to tell them but there was no one around, not sure if this is a usual thing or not but made me hold mine alittle tighter",BritinEgypt10
50,Love this dog beach,"Every time I take care of my friend's dog, I'll make sure we head over to Rosie's. The moment we turn into a parking spot off Ocean Blvd., she gets so excited (you can park along the road for free and don't have to use the beach parking lot... Most of the dogs we encounter are friendly and everyone seems to be getting along. Never had an issue here and having her run off leash is a huge plus. The dog beach does get busy during some parts of the day, I prefer going early morning or midday.",Henning F
50,Great Dog Beach!,I love coming here early morning early mornings. Plenty of parking and no crowds. It‚Äôs a great way to start the day. My dog loves it!

30,DOG BEACH?????,I love taking my dog to the beach. I normally take my dog to HB Dog beach but in the summer this beach and be too busy and it's hard to find parking. I tried the dog beach in Long Beach and I was not very happy with it. First the sand is not really sand but river silt so good luck trying to get the silt out of your dogs coat after. I had to wash my dog quite a few times for all the silt to get out of his coat. The water is super dirty from the port. I probably will not bring my dog back here again. At least Parking was abundant.,SteveFawley

20,Dog Beach,The only other dog beach I have been to is the one in Huntingtin Beach which is really good.I think Rosie‚Äôs Dog beach is a 2. It is great that it is even there and a lot of credit goes to the man that made it happen - Rosie‚Äôs owner.The main issues I have is it is too small and there are aggressive dogs with bad owners that go there. Perhaps if it was bigger you could get to a spot where other dogs would not bother you.Two different people told me their dog was attacked and killed there.We have taken our dog there 4 times and each time had a problem with an owner or aggressive dog. We have a Golden Retriever that gets along with any dog and any person.If you go go early on a weekday and avoid weekends!,Tatabooboobax

40,Fun for the dog and the people,"Rosie's isn't as big as the Huntington Dog Beach so it can get crowded and occasionally you get people who should really be in better control of their animals, but overall, it's a good place for our red heeler to chase his Chuck-It ball and romp in the waves while doing so. He loves to run on the beach. He doesn't care about the people or any other dogs and dodges around them in his pursuit of the ball and its return.Rosie's does have a small dog wash area on the way to the parking lot, in case you decide to hose the sand off of fido.",JLFERG

We attempted to pay for parking across from the Aquarium but there was a private event going on there and we were asked to leave.Since this was our son's request, we ended up dropping him off and letting him go to the festival while we went into town.This was our first visit to Long Beach and were very impressed even though parking didn't work out.",Dan W

You will also need to be DILIGENT about picking up after your dog (that's just courteous anyway, right?)Be aware, this is long beach harbor, so there is trash and odd debris around.

Amazing how just one or two people can screw the whole thing up. And if your dog is a bully or likes to attack other dogs because you can't control them, get some professional help and train your dog. I live close so sadly I've run into all kinds of things here.

50,My Dog Loved Going to Rosie's,"I lived in LB for a couple years and loved taking my dog to Rosie's Dog Beach. Rosie's is a perfect way to get your dog some much needed off-leash time. I took my dog Dexter a couple times a week, usually first thing in the morning or in the evening. I found those times had minimal crowds and it was mostly dogs, so we could get some good running and playing in (versus early afternoon when the beach would be crowded and there would be a lot of non-dog people there).Rosie's is a nice size and the boundaries are clearly marked with plenty of trash receptacles to dispose of your doggy bags, and people were pretty good about cleaning up after their dog. There's parking right there as it was about 4 miles walk for me from my apartment on 6th street in downtown LB. So I drove because I didn't want to make my dog walk when I'd rather him be playing off-leash. There's also the bike/walk trail and volleyball nets outside of the off-leash area. There's plenty of non-dog beach area too, so if you don't have a dog, please consider that Rosie's is for dogs and let the dogs have that space. If you're in LB or the LB area and have a dog, definitely go check out Rosie's.",LAThompson
50,My dog keeps taking me back there!,"Great location. Broad, flat beach with small surf ... big enough for the dogs to have fun but small enough to easily dive into to get a tennis ball.

50,Afternoon with family and dogs,"My family plays volleyball at this beach. While the kids are playing volleyball I take my granddaughter to the shore to play in the water and in the sand. We are always surrounded by the friendliest dogs who come to see what we are up to. Many lie on our beach towels while their people are around, many bring balls for us to throw and the dogs people are always smiling. This is a friendly place to go, to get dog love, spend time with family and enjoy the beach. People usually pick up after their dogs. Even though I do not own a dog it is one of my favorite places to hang out.",JuanitaB0nita
40,The ONLY public dog beach in Los Angeles County,"This beach is clean and easy to get to. Lots of metered parking and showers to clean up after your outing.Dogs can go off-leash if they are under control of the owner. It's a small section of the beach and waves are petite so it's perfect for small dogs and first-timers. Most owners are super friendly and welcome doggie interaction.For high-energy dogs (like my crazy running fool of a mutt), Huntington Dog Beach is better-suited, but it's farther for me, parking is more expensive, access is a bit more of a hike down the hill and there are no showers for cleaning up. So it's nice to have Rosie's in Long Beach.",imbernj

They will run up and trample your beach blanket and get you all sandy and wet... Just to say hello. :) so be ready and don't get upset. We loved it! A couple did bring a small 2-3 year old, and a dog knock her down. Again, just a friendly hello, but be smart... It's a dog beach not a baby beach. If you go a few feet south, you can sit and watch and be out of range. Nice beach, tons of shells, public toilet. Great day! Great view!",SunSister1

50,A great dog date,"Easy parking (bring quarters), you can let your dog off leash to frolic. Then walk to 2nd street where there are many dog friendly restaurants and have a libation. Then walk back. Your dog will love you for this. PS there is a dog wash place by Chucks, and this is also the closest restaurant to dog beach if you don't want to go to 2nd street",Howardniner R
40,The dogs have fun - the owners can be a bit much,"Rosie's Dog Beach is , I am told, the only dog beach in LA County. (I have not verified this) It is part of the beach of Long Beach. Dogs are allowed off leash to play with each other, frolic in the waves and dig holes in the sand. It is convenient to 2nd St which has many dog friendly restaurants should you want to continue the day with your best friend. Parking is very convenient - it is paid parking - $0.25 / hour so bring quarters. In general, it is a good group of dogs and owners who play well together. Rosie's is part of the Long Beach so people do walk by who do not have dogs and seem to get offended when they get sniffed or barked at or splashed. Also, some of the owners have dogs with behavioral issues and don't tell the rest of us until their dog has tangled with our perfect angels. Despite some of the people challenges, the dogs love it - and it is very convenient.",jsteadley

20,Dont care for the buried poop,"We have been to this beach with our dog and also Huntington Dog Beach. Rosies beach seems to be cluttered with people who do not like to pick up their dogs poop, just bury it. Sucks because not only do you walk into the stuff, but so do the dogs. I wish people spent more time watching their dogs, playing with their dogs and cleaning up after their dogs then on their cell phones and letting the dogs run wild. Not all other dogs like to be charged full throttle face first. Seems to have a better class of people at the Huntington Dog Beach then at Rosies.",Susiy R

30,"Crowded, erergetic off-lease dog beach","Now granted we chose to visit this dog beach mid day on a Saturday 8/15 so needless to say it was incredibly crowded. Our dog is a huge fetcher so having access to the water is critical since she we play until your arm is tired of throwing.Best to describe in simple pros and cons.Pros:- the only off lease dog beach within 25 miles of LA County- for the most part, responsible dog owners- lots and lots of dogsCons:- traffic to get there was frustrating- not the best signage indicating location for first time visitors- too congested - you basically had to carve your linear spot and watch to make sure dogs do no collided with each other- lack of public bathrooms- beach and ocean not the cleanest- parking was a bit nightmarish but not expensive- not very big (long) space which compresses the area of play for you and your dogBut I will say this. Since we could not make our normal trip to Ventura where the dog beach is open and relaxing, this place served its purpose. She was able to play in the ocean for about an hour and then we headed back home. Maybe it is better in the fall and less overcrowded. Will try again.",Mark H
40,"All sizes, breeds and colors, welcome !!","The beach is clean, with well marked perimeters indicating where the dog portion starts/ends. Pet owners are generally courteous and mindful of others and their pets.The only reason that this is not 'excellent' is that the bathroom was filthy and had no toilet paper. With the paid parking being $1/hr, I do believe the restrooms should be clean and stocked. Since there is no sink to wash hands either.....it was a bit disconcerting !",Rebeka C
30,Better Than Nothing,"This beach is way to small. It's easy to spot from a boat out in the harbor because even from a half mile a way you can see miles of almost empty beach, a hundred yards of crowded beach (Dog Beach), followed by a couple more miles of empty beach.

50,Great place to bring your dog,I am so glad this dog park exists and hope it continues to be open. There are very few places around this area where you can take your dog to the beach so both of you can enjoy the sun and surf. It was my dog's first time seeing the ocean and she loved it. She gives this beach two paws up. Lots of dogs and owners there enjoying the weather and socializing. The beach is clean and for the most part owners are responsible and clean up after their dogs. Dogs are allowed off leash as long as the owner controls them. It is a bummer that there is a charge for parking (parking meters) but I was happy to pay it so my dog and I could go to the beach together.,Diane H

When we moved up to Orange County and went to the dog beach at Huntington Beach, our hearts sank. Between having to scale rocks to get to the sand and having to leave early because other owners in Huntington apparently don't want their dogs to socialize, it was a real disappointment. Then we found Rosie's Dog Beach in Long Beach! First of all, PLENTY of parking and the parking is right on the flat sand. Such easy access all around. And the people at Rosie's are much more friendly and seem to just ""get it"" unlike the snobs at Huntington. This is a great beach and I highly recommend it. Your dogs will love it!

In fact, I have experienced that the dog owners who take their pups to Rosie's are down to earth. I've taken my dog to dog parks where people bring dogs that don't play nice with other dogs, but not at Rosie's. Let's face it, it's fun to let your dog run free and play in the waves and given the other dogs and their owners, I think Rosie's is a great place to take your pup for some exercise and for some ocean views for you.",Katie F

Also, you have the greatest amount of free space. My dog lives for the beach, so this is a go to for us. Your dog doesn't have to know how to swim if you are just enjoying the sand, but if it is going in the water, that tide is strong and they will have to be confident swimmer. Also, keep track of your metered parking. They love to give out tickets!",Betticat
30,Short and definitely a locals spot,"We come from Santa Cruz where we have several nice, long beaches to walk dogs. This beach has a section where dogs are allowed off-leash. We kept ours on-leash since he's a great pyrenees (off-leash - dis-a-pyr). The dog area was not very long and the people seemed rather un-friendly. There was a pit-type dog that was acting aggressively towards people walking by; the owners called him off and put him in a sit-stay. But didn't put a leash on him. Made me very nervous; and others seemed uncomfortable also. Apparently many So CA beaches are off-limits to dogs so I suppose this is better than no access. But we were not very impressed. Huge sign with lots of rules at the parking lot -- read and follow the rules so it stays a dog-friendly beach.",Deb_Mich

50,Excellent Unleash Dog Beach In Long Beach,"My husband and I used to take our dog here quite often when we used to live in Long Beach. There was always plenty of free street parking, but most of the time we lived close enough to ride our bikes over.The section that is coned off for dogs is right at the shore on one side of the beach and there were always plenty of people and dogs here in the afternoon and early evenings. Owners were pretty good about picking up after their dog and so this dog beach was pretty clean.Even our shy little dog enjoyed coming out here to run along the shore with my fianc√© and bark at the waves (I'm guessing he is either thinking the waves are growling at him or he thought that he had some kind of special ability to make the waves go back).Weather was always perfect and the waves were calm. I miss coming here and watching my dog enjoy his time here rolling in the sand and digging in the sand (make sure you bring a towel for your little friend or friends). This is a must place to take your dog if you live in the area and want to give your dog a new scene from his typical walks. Just don't forget to bring a few bags in case your little pup needs to use the restroom, bring a towel to dry him/ her off (and some doggie wipes for his/ her feet) and put on your sun block (and a hat with sunglasses couldn't hurt either).",meowmix318

50,"Good Dogs, Good Owners, Great Beach","My boyfriend and I recently adopted a puppy and since he's got lab and shepherd in him, we figured he might grow into a water lover. I'm glad we discovered Rosie's Dog Beach in our search. We listened to reviewers on different sites and arrived earlier in the day. Not only were the majority of dogs well-behaved off leash, but the owners were just as outgoing and friendly. When our pup was obviously too nervous to even go near the waves, numerous people offered us helpful advice. The beach was clean (owners cleaned up immediately after their pets) and a pretty good size. I imagine it could get overcrowded if you go in the afternoon on a hot weekend, but otherwise, you should be fine.Also - for anyone who might have a lengthy drive to Long Beach and is nervous about having to bring home a sandy/wet dog, there's a self-service dog wash just steps away.

50,Was Awesome,A great place to take the four legged member of the family! Not a huge beach but pretty nice indeed!,Arlene E
50,A Family Dog Beach,"We were just visiting but the dog beach was amazing. The small family like atmosphere not only insured individual ""puppy time"" but allowed you to interact with all the other puppy lovers. If you wanted to. In fact aside from a few accidents it was one of the cleanest dog beaches I have ever been to. The owners seemed to really care about there pooches and when I had run out of bags ( as it was a day) one regular was only too happy to help out with my bag shortage. It really was the best dog beach I have been to in Southern California. Its a little difficult to find as there are no signs but it was well worth the hunt!!! Its no wonder locals want to keep it to themselves!!!",laura w
50,Our favorite dog beach,"I take my borzoi, Goose, to Rosie's beach everyday as the proximity to my place in Belmont Shore is less than a quarter mile. The stretch of beach for the dogs to use isnt huge but increased this year and is only too small on really busy weekends. There are no fences or walls, only the ocean and a few cones and markers, so generally the dogs here are very well behaved and better socialized than dogs at typical dog parks. My dogs love running on the sand and taking a dip when the weather is hot. There are showers nearby to wash your dogs and a pet groomer within walking distance. If you are lucky you can see dolphins playing in the water as your dog runs on the sand.The only thing to watch out for is people who have left trash/food and the beach cleaning machines sometimes start late on weekdays and will still clean the beach even if dogs are playing. the drivers seem very unconcerned for the dogs, so be on watch.",MattA55
50,great beach for kids and pooches,Must take your dog here if you have one. Rosie's dog beach is made for our canine friends and their humans. A place for your dog to run around and have fun.,cloudb310
40,Day at Rosie's dog beach,"We had planned a trip to Long Beach to got Hydro biking with our dogs and decided to stop by Rosie's dog beach to check it out. It is great for parking. You can actually see the water from where you park. It was very close. We are used to going to the Huntington beach dog park , There is more room for your dogs at the huntington dog beach, but this is a nice little beach. We went during It is nice because there are no big waves which makes it better for my dogs. You need to bring coins for the parking meters, they don't take cards. they are open stalls with no doors. Luckily it was only friend and myself in there. And they had the door open so anyone could see in the first stalls. All in all this was a great beach to take your dogs. We will be going again...but just not using the restrooms.",252LisaC252
50,Totally Wonderful Pandemonium,This is a great place to take the pooch. Dogs rule as they frolic and race around on the beach and in the surf. Beautiful site and very poplular.,Martin Z
50,Highlight of our trip!,"Rosie's dog beach is located near the Belmont Pier (just about 4 miles from downtown Long Beach). It is the perfect place to play on the beach with your dog. Dogs can be unleashed to roam and play with other dogs although you must still supervise your dog just as you would a child. Don't forget to bring your pooper bags, they are a must! We will no doubt be back to Long Beach often because of Rosie's Dog Beach. This experience was the highlight of our trip.",Rhonda G
50,"Bring your dog, or come see the dogs",I love the way the dogs interact with each other. All they want to do is have fun. I just go there to watch!,Toni M
50,Rosie's Dog Beach,The only off leash dog beach in all of Los Angeles County. The area has recently been expanded and it's just the nicest place to bring your dogs and watch them swim in the ocean and just have a great time. We all owe a debt to Justin Rudd who worked hard to give us this beautiful place to bring our dogs and meet with our neighbors.,Pam C
30,Lots of dogs,I like the idea of taking your dog to the beach but the owners need to make sure they clean up after their pet. We were walking along the beach when several wet smelly dogs ran up to us and started shaking. Needless to say we smelled like wet dog. Owners just sat on the beach talking while the dogs ran all over.,Juanita K
50,Cute!!!!!,This was our puppies first time EVER at the beach and it was GREAT! She loved it and all the owners were very attentive of their dogs.,lonetraveler25
40,"Fun For All, Even Us Dog-less Humans","Let me start by saying, I do not own a dog, and generally am not a huge dog person (I prefer cats, so shoot me). That said, I LOVE this beach. My boyfriend and I had encountered the trash and horror that Long Beach beaches have become famous for, and were looking for a nice, safe beach for our most recent trip down. This beach was so much more! It was beautiful, with views of downtown and the Queen Mary, clear, beautiful water and smooth sand.We sunbathed, went for a swim, and watched the dogs playing and running in the water. The dogs were very well behaved, it's expected that only trained, friendly dogs are brought here. We had a few visitors run over and want to play, but each time they were timid, and nice, and quickly retrieved by their owners.Parking- metered parking available in a lot. However, if you don't have coins, there is free street parking just a bit farther away, but still quite convenient.I would recommend this beach for any dog owner, or any dog lover. In addition, it's just a wonderful beach for anyone looking for an afternoon on the beach. If the idea of dogs running around off leash does bother you though, just continue down Ocean Drive as the numbered cross streets increase, and the dog beach will end, and you will have a beautiful beach just for humans. Just be sure not to head towards the lower cross streets towards City Beach, because it will get dirty and unpleasant. Stick to south of Belmont Pier, and the beaches are lovely.",Michelle R
40,Dogs are everywhere!!,"We don't live near the beach, so we wanted to take our dog to the ocean to see what she thought of it all. We found Rosie's Dog Beach near our friend's house and went down to give it a try.There were tons of dogs everywhere having a blast. Everyone was getting along and enjoying the beach and the ocean. Our dog, JoJo, decided that the ocean was a little scary and didn't want to actually go in the water, but she loved running around on the sand.It's a great opportunity to take your animals to the beach, the only downside is that there are a ton of dogs and people down there in that narrow strip of sand. It's a shame that there are restrictions on animals on the rest of the beach because it seems as if dog owners know that picking up after your animals is part of the responsibility of owning a dog. Why segregate? Where's the doggie love?",mauiwolf
40,Fun in the Sun,"My dog loves to go to the dog beach because he gets to see a lot of other dogs and people! Lucky for everyone, the people of Long Beach (including myself) are rather responsible when it comes to raising dogs. It's a nice way to let my dog enjoy running around freely with new friends!",Denise C
50,One of my dog's favorite play areas,"To my knowledge, this is the only dog beach in LA County. My pit bull Stella really enjoys romping on the sand and in the waves as she chases a tennis ball or frisbee. During the summer, this help both of us beat the heat. Also, on some evenings, free moves are shown nearby where she can lie on a blanket with me as we watch family oriented entertainment under the stars.",davidcatcohen
50,Nice dog beach,"A great to be at the beach with your best friend. Very nice beach for our four legged friends to interact and play in the ocean. Very small waves, so not a threat to any dog. We always see all sizes of dogs getting along. Our dog love to go.",BigBill45
50,DOGS LOVE IT!,"I could go to this dog beach with my dog and watch the other dogs go crazy and play their hearts out. It make me so happy to see all these dogs so excited and happy. They would run into the water and come back out and chase other dogs in the sand. Some will dig holes in the sand and bury themselves in it. Others are more shy and will just stay with their owners on the beach towels while watching all the other dogs play. The beach is small. There are cones designating where dogs are not allowed to be. Just stay within the cones and you're fine. During my couple hours here, I saw all owner picking up after their dogs. Which is a good sign. I haven't seen anyone not pick up after their dog.",nlee1220
30,Nice beach,"My pup just got all of his shots and us finally old enough to go out to the doggie beach. We went yesterday and it was a little disappointing. The area sectioned off for the dogs was pretty small in comparison to how many dogs were actually there. Also, I guess some of the owners don't understand their dogs need to have manners at a place like this. There were a couple dogs that would run up to other dogs and growl and bark at them. Not cool. If your dog has a tude, why bring them here?? Lastly, apparently you can't walk with your along the beach path...you have to trek across the sand thru the vball courts (while people are playing) to enter and leave the beach. We got scolded along with another couple by beach patrol for doing the opposite. All in all, not a horrible place...just not my favorite. Will probably stick to the doggie beach in HB.",woofy576
30,It's a Dog's Life,"So we're told there's a Dog Beach where dogs can run free with the breeze in their fur. When we arrive, there are two sticks with flags on them a few yards apart and they say ""Your dog can run between the sticks only. After that they have to be on the leash for face a citation."" Like a dog running free with the breeze in their fur is going to know what sticks mean. Less than impressed with the situation. Fee for parking.",Flynn123
