30,A peace of history,"Great rates and the newest movies. I love the vintage neon signs and the surrounding business. Yummy ice cream next door, wish we could bring it in! Plus they hold classic movies on certain days of the week, so much fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellisinla

50,Great Local Theater,"The facade out front is old school blinking neon lights, but inside every theater is stadium seating. They have first run movies and even a classic movie series that runs throughout the year. During the week there are kiddie matinees for the little ones and their parents to attend. I think the kids even get in free. Plus if you go to their website you can download a coupon for a free popcorn with the purchase of a drink. There are also discounted prices on a couple of days during the week, so seeing a movie doesn't necessarily have to break your budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jusshl
50,Good theatre in whittier,Time weighted prices make this theater a good value.Parking can be challenging but it's worth it.Generic design inside but the uptown area does have some charm,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/utt959
40,Best Theater Experience in Town,"Located in Uptown Whittier, this theater has about 8 screens showing the latest movie releases. The prices are the best you'll get of any theater showing newly released movies. If you attend any movie before noon, it's on $5, before 6PM it's only $6. Of course it's a little bit extra for 3D movies.If you print up the coupon from the website you can take if for a free small popcorn when you purchase at large drink. They will even upgrade to a large popcorn, you just have to pay the price difference. Since their popcorn is freshly popped, I always make sure to get the largest size. Another added bonus is that there is one free refill for the large drinks and popcorn!Every theater comes with stadium style seating, so you don't have to worry about the person in front of you blocking your view. Some of the theaters are a bit small, but it just adds to the intimacy. If you're coming from a surrounding city, it's definitely worth the trip because of all the money you'll save compared to going to one of the big movie establishments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FitTeacher

You can go online to the starlight website and print out coupons for a free large coupon. Starlight has over 5 popcorn topping including caramel powder. so good. There are tons of pubs and restaurants on the same block as starlight. I live a few minutes from starlight and I prefer to see a new movie on the weekday.

50,Whittier Village Cinemas,"I live in Whittier, CA and I love going to the Village Cinemas in Uptown Whittier. It's in the middle of the historic and trendy part of Whittier. There are a lot of shops and restaurants around the theater - a multiplex style theater, and they tend to stay open late to accommodate the post-movie crowd. The theater shows the newest films on their opening dates, and seating is ample. They also have special showings of ""old"" movies during the day and early evening, during summer. They keep the children in mind during these special showings - quite a pit of Disney and other animated favorites.It is clean, well lighted, and there are 2 snack bars. The ticket prices are reasonable, and may even be a little lower than the large theaters. Seniors (55 and older) get in for $5! There are children and student rates, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisCabrera

40,"Really takes you back in time, yet updated.","Went to see a movie not knowing what the theater would be like. It's not typical. Outdoor, covered entrance with narrow hallways for concessions. Prices are great before 6. The theater we were in was a bit small, like 10 rows with steps seperating them in the middle, so was concerned at first. Once the movie started, the screen enlarged and the surround sound blasted and all was well. It's nestled on this lovely street with all the restaurants and shops, etc. and takes you back to the 40's and 50's but is somewhat updated. Nice experience! Not huge like corporate theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djz032070
