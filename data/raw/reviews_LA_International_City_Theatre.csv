50,Can't wait to return!,"I love this theater! I just wish I lived closer so I could be a season ticket holder! The acting and singing was amazing! There is a charge for parking. I arrived early and crossed the entry drive-way and went up the stairs to a fountain area. From there, one can access a second story walk-way. I followed that for approx. a city block and took a walkway/bridge over to the convention center and went down stairs. There are a bunch of restaurants in the area. Really a great time!",Lucky RN
50,Great theatre experience,"This area of Long Beach has been redeveloped and is just a beautiful area. Nice job by the city. The theater itself is very nice and intimate. Recommend catching dinner nearby and walking over to the theater. We ate at 555 East Steakhouse, parked our car at the valet for eight dollars, and then walked over to the theatre. It was a short walk and just a word of warning, it was a somewhat steep hill for people that might have trouble with that.We saw Billie holiday there and it was fantastic. It was only a cast of two but held our attention. Great show!",SMB4_1958
50,Great production(s). Current Durang play great.,"I never cease to be thrilled by the ICT's productions, acting, quality and value. Tickets are very affordable. The acting is top notch and they bring quality productions to Long Beach. A frequent must see on our list.",Jeffrey S
50,Excellent!,We attend ICT whenever we can fit it into our schedule. Every performance we have seen here is excellent. The comedies are outstanding. Highly recommend you check it out for a fun evening in downtown Long Beach!,Carol C

30,Poor choices,I have attended several plays here in the past. All of them were sub standard. I get there advertisements via email very frequently and most of them do not interest me. I keep hoping that they will improve. their pricing does not match the quality of their presentations. The Long Beach Playhouse and Music Theater West are much better venues.,murjoe
50,Treat Yourself!,Great local theatre just 4 miles from our home. It's an intimate venue and there isn't a bad seat in the house. Every production we have seen was completely professional and excellent. And you won't believe how affordable it is. Add in a light meal at one of Long Beach's great restaurants and you have a wonderful evening out that won't break the bank. Enjoy!,Carol C
50,Small theater with Big City Talent,"Every play I've attended at ICT has had excellent, professional actors and actresses doing top quality performances. The staging is masterful and the the small theater makes for real connections with the cast as well as great sight lines, so you don't miss anything. The theater itself is reason enough to attend and share an intimate performance experience.",TrinaSchoon
50,Top-notch live theater in Long Beach,"We have been subscribers for years now, and the quality of the productions just gets better and better. Artistic director caryn desai carefully selects the productions so you have a subtle theme for the season and a variety of experiences. The actors have all been excellent, some are award-winners. The theater is fairly small so you can see well from any seat.",crbandlsm
50,Beautiful Theater Experience,"We loved this theater! We went to see a play at the last minute that was excellent, but were really impressed with the theater itself. All patrons were seated to the center and slightly to the sides of the stage. Every seat was good. They had all seats filled in, and they curtained off and covered sections not being used so that the theater felt full. I thought that was marvelous, for the actors on stage as well as the patrons. The lighting was good and acoustics were excellent in this small to medium sized theater. Drinks and snacks were available both before the show and during intermission. We really enjoyed our experience and hope to return the next time we are visiting in the area.",Jodie D
50,Great place for intimate and unique theatre.,"I have been a subscriber to ICT's theater series for five years. The always offer up a diverse and interesting line-up, combining a few well known small shows with many regional debuts and unknown shows. The theater is quite small, and there are really no bad seats. The audience tends to be on the older side, but the shows appeal to any audience and cover some controversial and topical subjects, as well as more historical contexts. It is a real shame that the people of Long Beach do not do a better job at supporting the arts, we lost our Broadway series a few years ago, but this is an excellent opportunity to see a good show in Long Beach.",downinit
