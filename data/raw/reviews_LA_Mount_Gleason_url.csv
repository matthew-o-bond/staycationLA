50,Very Cool !!,"Mt. Gleason - one of the highest peaks in Los Angeles, CA. The ride to the summit was beautiful. We were one of three autos in a two hour period (and it was a SUNDAY!) The L.A. basin/San Fernando Valley regestered around 85 degrees, so we were wearing shorts ONLY ! Once we reached the top of Mt. Gleason, we were shivering in the 40 degree air, so bring a fleece. The views from the summit warmed our souls (but not our bodies). After a quick look, we found our bearings - the L.A. skyline looked tiny, the twin towers of Century City were so small, one could easily miss them. The curve of Santa Monica Bay, Palos Verdes, Catalina, Long Beach were clearly visible but distorted due to the 6,000 ft. elevation as well as the position of the peak in relation to the rest of L.A. county.As I now travel the Ventura Freeway (101 N), I look to the north and I see Mt. Gleason, looming in the distance, reaching high among the sky, towering above the Verdugo Hills and find it hard to believe that I've driven to that beautiful, majestic peak.**** (five stars) !! :)Tre Gibbs, Los Angeles, CA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stay405
