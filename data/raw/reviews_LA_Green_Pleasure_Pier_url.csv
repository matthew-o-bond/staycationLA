40,Avalon - a pretty little town,"Avalon was a pretty little town nestling around a bay at the foot of hills. There were many restaurants and touristy shops. The Green Pier was much smaller than we’d imagined. The Casino building was very impressive, dominating one end of the bay. We wanted to walk there and see the famous ballroom but were disappointed to be told that we could only look inside if we booked a tour at the Green Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaview5
50,Red Semi-Sub at Green Pier,"We stopped for a quick bite to eat on the pier prior to taking the red semi-sub which docks at the far end of the pier. The tour of the fish sanctuary was marvelous, with amazing fish including the golden garibaldis swimming all around you. It's a tour you shouldn't miss when coming to Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnniversaryVoyager
40,Day trip,Really enjoyed our time on Catalina Island. We waited to get off the ferry and we shouldn't have waited. By the time we got off there weren't any available room on excursions or transportation (golf carts). Had to wait and therefore didn't get to see as much if the island as we wanted. Make sure you get off first.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armandoe123

30,Interesting pier,"Well you have to take a walk on the pier and check it out. It's a bit busy since it has some shops and small restaurants. A bit touristy, but that should be expected. Past the chaos, you can find some hardy fishermen which is interesting. Of course you get a better view of the harbor there. There are also some cool boats tied up including the sub.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
50,Pier fishing gem of California,"You don't need a license for pier fishing. It is a very cost effective fun time if you like to catch and release. Most of the fish by the pier are either less than 14"" or protected species. You can rent the fishing rod and buy bait from The Edgewater on the main broadwalk itself. I got a nice strong rod, a filet knife, a towel and a pack of squids for less than $20. I spent 3 hours and the rental was for 4 hours. I gave away a few of my squids as I have had enough fishing by 2pm. It is very beautiful to sit by the bench and enjoy the company of other tourists and even a pelican who waited for my catch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realtor_Chupco

So many choices on the Green Pleasure Pier -- snacks, scuba, boating, submarine tours, fishing, etc. Or just enjoy the people watching, from dawn until well into Catalina's often-lively nights. The Pier is also an excellent landmark to photograph or film when you take a can't-miss hike onto one of the high ridges surrounding Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690

50,Iconic Symbol of Catalina,"This pier has been here since I was a kid, and that was a VERY long time ago. Back in the days when we used to come to Catalina Island via the big ship instead of these fast little boats they have nowadays. Back then it took a long time to reach Catalina and part of the fun was the leisurely cruise over there.There's still lots to do on the Green Pleasure Pier, from the embarking site of the submarine tour (semi-sub) to the famous Glass-bottom boat tour, seems every water/sea tour begins and ends here. We even went on the flying fish tour here. There's a small dive shop where you can rent gear ranging from tanks and masks to simple snorkel gear. As you near the small beach area there's a huge public restroom very close to the Green Pleasure Pier. This also serves the sandy beach area on either side of the pier.Tons of fun for the whole family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven

40,Place to book island activities,"Not a large pier at all, but its a great place to rent gear for water activities, book island activities, or grab a quick bite. Its great for picture taking, as it sits back from Avalon a bit and gives you a closer look at the sea of boats in the harbor.I think there are only about 2-3 places located on the pier where you can get food from - mostly lunch/snack bites. There are several of the activity vendors located on the pier for you to book activities, see maps, etc... This is not a place to 'hang out', but its worth a quick walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578brandic
40,"Small, but the turquoise is indeed a pleasure for the eyes.","This pier is quite small but the turquoise paint surely will catch your eye.
