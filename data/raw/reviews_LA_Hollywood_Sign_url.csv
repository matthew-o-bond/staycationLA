50,Getting to this place is not so easy but when you visit it you will not regret the time and effort spent this place is c,"Having visited this place, I experienced a storm of emotion , this is a truly fascinating place , something that is really worth visiting and visiting every person, it is not just an inscription or some sign, it is a sign with its own history. The sign was first erected in 1923 ‚Äî during the beginning of the Golden Era of Hollywood, when movies were just beginning to bring in fabulous revenues. The sign is almost the same age as Hollywood itself. Then it was planned that it will last only 18 months. But there are also and cons for example , such as a sign not to get too close because he was watching NCIS Los Angeles and so if she sees that people come too it can get you arrested , but if you are an American citizen and deport you from the country. In General, I think this place is really fascinating and amazing in all of Los Angeles .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Q9884RL
30,Difficult,Only a couple ways to see this up close all of them are a pain in the rear end. A private streets were people really don't like you driving or parking in front of their homes. I can't say that I blame them. Take a look at as you drive on one of the surface streets and leave it at that. Ain't much else to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldProChef
50,A visit to Los Angeles isn‚Äôt complete without seeing ‚Äòthe sign‚Äô!,"We used the Big Bus company for our hop on hop off tour, which took in seeing the sign from several streets giving us good views of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tauntonholidayers
50,The most beautiful experience,"I took the almost 2 hour hike, but stopped short of the Hollywood sign, instead turned where the trail led to the Observatory.Then circled around and the vistas opened up revealing the wonders of the various skylines: Burbank, Glendale, Downtown, Century City, Wilshire District and Hollywood. It is a faultless hike, perfumed by the fauna and flora of the environment , and having made oft treks there, developed my own secret garden there.I can not wait for the spring so that I can immerse myself in the timeless beauty of my past experiences.Especially now, when the virus rages, I can't wait to find my piece of paradise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamg36
30,Famous Landmark,"We saw the Hollywood Sign several times while we drove up and down Mulholland Drive. We did stop at the Jerome C. Daniel Overlook above the Hollywood Bowl. At the overlook there is a staircase (it's not terribly long or difficult) to get a better view of LA and you can see the sign from up there. it's not the best view, I'm sure there are better ones, but it worked for us. Minus an actual hike, there doesn't seem to be a great way to see the sign close up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Betsyat240
50,Landmark to visit,Its a landmark to visit if you are in LA. You can visit very near if you take a hike but there are many points which will take you as close as we can see in picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DandaN40
50,Once in a lifetime Hike,"It was indeed a long hike from the Griffith Observatory .. I did made a mistake to start my hike quite late in the afternoon, 3pm and reached the back of the Hollywood sign around 530pm.. and the journey back was basically in darkness but luckily I was able to get back to the Observatory safely... Well, it is once in a lifetime experience since it is my first visit to Los Angeles after missing two opportunities to visit USA back in 1999 and 2009....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennyLWT79
50,Highlight of trip,One of my fave films is Friends with Benefits and I always said 1 day I would go to the Hollywood sign & at last I did.I got a taxi as far up as was allowed although he tried to fob me off with the view at Griffith Park 1st but I wanted closer lolOnce I got out taxi there was construction work further up so wasn‚Äôt allowed unless a resident I did say I was but he didn‚Äôt believe me üòäSo I got as close to the best shot possible for me and then walked down and just admired the views. It really did it for me & made my LA experience even better well worth the trek üëç,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sallyalfie
30,Really long walk to go there,"Well it was a pretty rough hike up there. We had way too little to drink with us. It is really steep in some parts and lots of rocks and dirt so better to have proper hiking shoes (instead of sneakers etc). Took about 2,5 hours with absolutely limited breathers and 5 mins at the sign. Sign is behind the fence and You can see only the top of the letters. I am not sure if this is the place to visit, unless You really enjoy hiking a lot! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simothehill
50,HIKE,"We did the hike, was amazing not easy to do. full of nature and good sight of the city, take water with you.

40,Best view is from Griffith observatory,"Great view from Griffith observatory- also overlooks the entire L.A. area.Many people go there, and take pictures from the overlook. Parking will cost you, and we should have paid, but we went there on January 2nd, at about 8am.We drove up, and only planned to stay 15-20 minutes for pictures.Nobody was collecting for parking, so we got our pictures and left.Definitely suggest to anyone visiting the area for a few days to go here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidn0209

50,Tick off the list when in LA,"You can't go to LA and not get a picture with the Hollywood sign. GPS will take you to the best viewing point but mind you it is very crowded and parking is along the residential streets so can be hard to find. Also the viewing point is very crowded so hard to get a picture without strangers in it. You can drive around the windy residential roads in order to get close to the sign. However since roads are narrow and residents have their cars parked, at times there could be a traffic jam with incoming traffic. Also do not even think about parking in no parking zone as the parking patrol officer does roam around the area and will issue a fine. Can hike to get close to the sign, however we did not so cannot comment on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyaV661
30,Hollywood Sign,The Hollywood Sign is best seen and photographed from the Griffith Observatory which is very close by. There is no blockage and the sign is bright white against the setting sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels

Whenever you are able to get a decent picture driving by, you are as close as you are going to get without an enromous headache. We went to the recommended point for photos, and it was a giant driving, parking, walking headache and the pictures of the sign at the observatory were no better than the ones we could've taken from the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CR141
40,No Lights on Sign at Night,"The iconic Hollywood sign is a cool thing to see, but don‚Äôt look too hard for it at night because it is totally dark and you won‚Äôt be able to see it. Disappointing.

50,A long walk,"We started from the bottom parking lot and the walk up to where the observatory parking is was steep,, but after that it is pretty gradual climbs.

40,A fun visit,"A fun visit to find a spot to see it but do not make it a main attraction. If you get to a spot where you can view it in the hills, take your pics and go. Be careful of parking in the hills as there's alot of no parking areas and they ticket you fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilsonLin

50,Easy way to get near sign. Your phone will send you the wrong place.,We used our phone for directions and it sent us to a closed road with no view and no parking. SOOOO .This is my suggestion. Do your search to get to Canyon Lake Drive or Lake Hollywood Park as shown on my attached map. Lots of parking at the park and open space for lots of shots of all types. You can also go a bit down Canyon Lake Dr and catch a dirt trail for about 1/2 mile to get a more special view. You will see people on the top of trail and can decide if you want to do that or not. Please like my post if you found this helpful. Cheers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1naturalist

50,Hollywood Sign Hike,"Can be a little bit tiring but, in my opinion, absolutely worth it. You get very nice views on the way there as well as on the top.It takes about an 1h to get to the sign and then slightly less to get down.The paths are are rocky and sandy so don‚Äôt bother wearing your brand new designer shoes. Also make sure you have a bottle of water with you.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/683kristinez

40,Iconic southern California hike,"The Hollywood sign is famous, and after multiple trips to Southern California we finally managed to hike to it. Look online for hiking routes - the closest one is currently closed due to disputes with neighborhood home owners. The route we took (via the Brush Canyon Trail) was about 6.5 miles total out and back. It took us about 3 hours.We first went up the entire way to the top of Mount Lee, with views of the back of the sign. (There are signposts directing you at trail intersections). Then we headed down but took the .4 mile side spur to the water tower area, for views and photos of the front of the sign. I was glad that we did both; the different perspectives were interesting, and you really get a sense of how large the letters are when you're right above them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SnowyShasta

50,Really cool. Gotta work to get there.,We walked from the Observatory and took an unpaved route for over a mile (a bit scary) but ended up on a paved road and walked to the back of the sign. Cool view! We then walked around to get a good pic of the front. Lots of walking but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jammro18
50,Iconic Hollywood stop!,"Iconic Hollywood stop! Be sure to take an Uber or taxi to the start of the hike as street parking around that area is reserved for residents only- you will get a ticket.

50,To think it began as a promotion for a residential development,"One of the most famous images in the world had a rather prosaic origin. Erected in 1923 as an advertisement for a residential build, it then spelt out Hollywoodland in huge capital letters.It became such a popular symbol that the original intention to take it down it was shelved and in the late 1940s the final four letters were removed.We saw it from many parts of the city but probably best vistas were from Griffith Park and Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,hollywood,"The sign was nice. It was crazy to see billionaires living such high class lives with homeless people right at the end of the driveway. What makes it better is the rich are so uptight and greedy that they wont even fix the roads they live on, they merely have drivers or don't drive according to the law so it doesn't seem to reflect on them. If the pollution/fog don't getcha, one of the homeless or walking crazies will! I was so disappointed. I find it embarrassing and I don't even live there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerriVice
40,Worth the Trip!,"Depending on where you park, this can be quite a walk. We were about 2-1/2 hours round trip. Look carefully for a map or at YouTube online. The trails are marked, but depending on which way you're walking, you might miss them and find yourself a bit lost! (we did) Also, there are NO BATHROOMS or trashcans anywhere on the walk, so be prepared! We walked from the canyon to the front of the sign...highly recommend walking to the front of the sign, as the backside of the sign is mostly towers and equipment. The trail is wide and well-kept. It is pristine, except for one piece of trash we saw! From the top, you can see the whole sign and a very beautiful vista of LA, including out to Palos Verdes and the ocean. It really is spectacular! We also recommend walking in cooler weather, as it is a bit of a hike from the canyon, and in summer it would be VERY hot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodToGoGirl

50,A Great Walk,"One of the highlights of our trip. We caught an Uber to Beachwood Canyon and walked to behind the sign. The paths are wide and well sealed so you don‚Äôt feel unsafe at all. There were stunning views of LA and loved being so close to the sign that we had otherwise admired from a distance.There is no shade from the sun so I think the walk in the cooler temps of winter was perfect.We were so exhilarated by the climb and view that we decided to walk to the Griffith Observatory. This took us about 1 hour 45 mins with a few photo stops.We forgot water so we were glad the weather was not hot. There was just one water stop on that walk and it‚Äôs quite a way in. Also, there are no toilets until you reach Griffith Observatory.We definitely spent a lot longer doing the trails than we had planned but it was wonderful to be out in this wide open space in the middle of LA.Google Maps does have the footpaths on their maps which are really handy if you get worried about which fork in the path to take.You can easily catch Uber from the Observatory and there is a cafe there for refreshments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimandCliff
40,Iconic Photo Stop,"Though you can view the signs at many places from the city (eg. Hollywood & Highland Center & Griffith Observatory), we decided to drive to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive to take some photos for the iconic sign.The place was filled with people and parking took forever but we made it. It is quite a steep slope to walk upwards or downwards so please be cautious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoinahJaeb

40,Iconic Sign & Great Views,"There is not much to do in the area except to see the famous Hollywood Sign and take in the nice views of the city from the hills. The Hollywood Sign is fenced off so that you can't get right up to it but you will be able to get some great photos from there. If you are driving, take N. Beechwood Drive for some great views of the area. It is worth seeing and it feels good to know that you have been there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuckyL365

50,Bring water!!,"Park your car at the Griffiths observatory and combine this visit to get ""two for one"". Fantastic view over LA from this nearby attraction. There is no coffee stops on this trail so bring your own besides lots of water, you sure need it on hot days. It takes 1-2 hours to get there but is worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30larsh

50,Curvy drive to the sign,Stopped in with my girls and their new cameras to take pictures of the classic sign. Went Lake Hollywood Park to see the sign. It was a great view. Fun to see such an iconic sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nahubbard
50,Worth the hike,Park along the street (where it‚Äôs legal- they WILL ticket if you park where it says no parking and LA tickets are very expensive (over 100 in some cases). Park where you can then hike up to one of the clearings. Great photo op and a pleasant hike but use the trail beside the road cars were moving fairly quick. It‚Äôs uphill but not terrible and worth the effort. Nice view (but the views are better from other places like Griffith observatory). Great keepsake photos! It‚Äôs only takes about an hour- tops -but it is worth doing! Don‚Äôt pay for a tour unless they will drop you off at a great vantage point. You can do it self guided. It‚Äôs a quick stop no visit to la should skip! Free parking along the road but spots are hard to find on weekends. If you can go during the week it will be easier. There are several places where the green fencing is not blocking the view and these are great for photos. You really can‚Äôt touch the sign but it feels pretty close from the neighborhood below the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/610charj
50,Exciting to see,"Definitely exciting to see this in person but once we‚Äôd taken our pics at the Griffith Observatory we didn‚Äôt feel it necessary to try and get any closer. We enjoyed the views from here but with young children, hiking any further wasn‚Äôt really an option for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M4B
40,Another way to see the sign,I traveled to a Hollywood and did not have a lot of time. The one thing I wanted to see was the Hollywood sign. So I will share that I found was to view the sign from Hollywood and Highland. It was cool to see the sign and it is a great view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18ah20
40,Smaller than I thought,"When in Hollywood getting a good snap of the sign is a must, We managed to pull up for some great snaps on way back from the observatory. Park at own risk on the housing estate as signs for towing in place.Sign was smaller than I always imagined it to be but was good to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellutd
40,When in....Hollywood?,There was a few places to catch a nice view of the Hollywood sign for a photo op. We caught some good ones while on Hollywood blvd at the Hollywood and highland by the Chinese theatre.

50,"""Must see"" the lazy way","We really don't like hiking, so we decided to do it the easy way.If you have ""Google Maps"" and you like to do things your way, follow my steps.That day, I draw my own maps (see pics) and I decided to follow two different paths.The first one is uphills and the second is downhills.If you have some time to spare, you drive West of Downtown, pass Getty Center and go East to ""Hollywood Sign View Point"". The drive is very pleasant in a residential route, full of trees in low traffic.View point is the closest point to take pictures and it has plenty of space that you can legally park. Take lots of pics from the sign and overlooking LA.On your way back, you just follow the same road downhills, you pass very nice houses in a very low traffic area.Don't be scared of the signs that they discourage tourist to go around.My way back was through ""Santa Monica Blv"" to Santa Monica Pier.(was it helpful? give your vote)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasileiosb373
50,Pleasant hike on a pleasant day - great nature escape,The hike to the Hollywood sign is a pleasant break from the bustle of Los Angeles. The scenery is pretty and the view at the top as long as it is clear is quite nice. We did the brush canyon trail that has a dirt road with intermittent paving. It was about 5 miles round trip but not too strenuous with good footing. We ended up behind the sign which means you are higher. Pleasant way to spend the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454christinac
50,Hollywood Sign Must See,"We hiked to the sign without a tour guide. This was our first time in Hollywood so we knew we wanted to hike it. We had no idea what to do and there are not many posted signs to help. We figured it out, it can be done on your own. Things to know: Take your Uber/Taxi/Lyft to the Griffith Observatory. (We told our driver to take us to the sign and he dropped us off at some tennis courts. We had to take another driver to the right spot.) Thats where the hike will begin. For non-hikers like us, it took us 4 hours to go behind the sign, in front of the sign, and back. There is VERY LITTLE signage along your way. There is also only one drinking fountain. Be prepared with water. The water fountain is about an hour's hike from the sign. Bring plenty. Going behind the sign is pretty cool. You can take some cool pics from the platform. Its worth the hike. You can then also go back down the mountain and take another path for a head on view. It is totally worth it. Wear VERY COMFORTABLE shoes and plan for this to take anywhere between 3-5 hours. Depends on in shape you are. And how long you want to take in the view. I am very glad I did it. My legs hurt very bad that evening, but I now have the memory forever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood_Help

40,Must go here,"If your in Hollywood you must see the iconic Hollywood sign we did a few sightseeing trips Beverly Hills etc but none got near enough to the sign, and a trip to the sign only was $30 per person, all you have to do is get the LYFT taxi app on your phone if your in the Sunset or Hollywood Blvd area a cab is only $7 when you get up there you can‚Äôt believe how big the letters are. As I said it‚Äôs a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terry134J
50,Point of reference Hollywood Sign,"I grew up in LA, one place to know how to find your bearing is the Hollywood sign. Read about it history, a land development build it to attract buyers. Point of reference to some locals, it points somewhat North. H is for West and the Y for East.South is behind you. Off Franklin and Gower,heads for the sign. Up on the mountain , horse stables used to exsist,you could down to Franklin canyon, many movies shot took place in the cave. Look up you see the Hollywood castle, in many movies and rented out for parties, Moat,draw bridge, dance hall, step down fireplace, ect .Sets moods for Midevil effect.Off Hollyridge where many Celeb reside. You can also find them at thw market. If you know who to look for ,Read up on Hollywood Hills lot of interesting history. See if you can spot Madona s home west of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJ4444
30,Nothing special,"Overrated touristy place. Nothing special another than a long drive. Does not have amentities or any entertainment or dining nearby. Not worth a drive.

40,So touristy yet it never gets old!,This was my 3rd time in LA and I made it a point to getting an up-close-and-personal photo with the sign this trip. Best place to have the shot (without hiking) would be at Lake Hollywood. You can either drive up or catch an Uber or a Lyft (but u may want to hang on to your driver while you take those shots as it may be difficult to get another rider back).Important: Obey and respect the rules about where to park and stop your car. The residents and park patrol are quite sticky about this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kooifei
50,Iconic sote,"The best way to view the site is to drive to Lake Hollywood Park. From there you can not only take great pics of the iconic sign, but also have fantastic views! The drive isn‚Äôt very long, about 2-3 miles up the hill past private homes. Make sure you go on a nice day. First time we got there, the sign was covered with clouds. We didn‚Äôt see much. Oh, and be prepared, there is zero internet there. No service for your data. So remember your roads once you start driving up the hill, so you could get back and not to get lost!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cool_alaska
40,Hollywood Sign,"There is no ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect visiting the Hollywood sign other than the accomplishment that you too have been the popular spot that is in movies. You can one day say ‚Äúlook I was there‚Äù to your grandkids lol. The hike is not that steep or far, there is really not much to it but the sign in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monalisak229
50,Only one of it‚Äôs kind,Hollywood Sign is only one of it‚Äôs kind in the world. There are several places in and around Los Angeles/Hollywood area from where the sign is visible. The best way to view the sign from up close is to park the car alongside Lake Hollywood Park and walk up the hill towards an empty open space. The walk could be a bit strenuous and is about a mile from Lake Hollywood Park. Spectacular views of downtown LA from up that hill as well. Certainly worth several camera pic clicks from any spot where the sign is visible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716sachink
50,Iconic,Definitely worth a look if you‚Äôre in the area-I‚Äôve seen it so many times on television and it was cool to be able to see it in person!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKordziel
50,Head for the Hills,"My recommendation: Skip the Walk of Fame, and use Uber or Lyft to take you to the 6200 block of Mulholland Highway in the Hollywood Hills. You‚Äôll find a handful of spots to get great views of the sign ‚Äî and can then meander down Mulholland a short distance to enjoy Lake Hollywood Park. I was there with my son, and this was a great way to let him see the sign without all the hassle and tourist traps of the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TideTraveler98
50,nice day/sunset hike,My husband and I hiked up the path from the Griffith Observatory location. Pretty easy hike considering we're used to challenging and lengthy hikes through the woods. The views are breathtaking. The top of the trail has a great view of the Hollywood sign as well as nice sunset views as you're going down. Can stay up there for a bit and relax.Pretty cool for a touristy location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gemini1451
50,Nice place,"For sure is a place to visit and take a shot becuase is enormous and so beautiful. The only is to be careful where to park , police ready to give you tickets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/68TRAVELLER79
30,Average at best,"While it was exciting to see the sign, you are not able to get close to it without taking a 4 hour round trip hike. Event with this, you are still limited with how close you can get to it. The Griffith Observatory was an educational place to visit, but the visibility to sign is ok at best. Not what I was hoping for, but I‚Äôd love to be right up on the sign for pictures. Depends on what you expect. This was taken from the roof of the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11mmc11
40,Go for hiking,"You must go hiking and see the sign up close. Than when you look at the back, you see the beautiful city. Very nice to check out LA view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliverl0425
40,"GREAT EXPERIENCE, LONG TREK IN THE HEAT, NOT LIKE HOW YOU IMAGINE ON TV!","We visited the Hollywood sign on our vacation to LA and it was a great experience.We cheated and hired an Uber to take us up to the highest point driveable near to the sign and made our own way from there. Even though we got the Uber (pretty much to the top), there was still a long hike to complete before we even got close to the sign (which can be quite challenging during the hotter months and if your fitness levels aren't overly high as it's all up hill).There are plenty of photo opportunities beforehand (that don't require you to do the hike) that you can take advantage of.When you reach the sign you realise it's not how it is in the films, you can't get anywhere near it and is located on a steep hill. You sometime see people in films sitting on or near the sign but this is simply not possible.It was a great experience but there is no benefit to walking all the way up to the sign, you may as well take the photos from the photo ops below and enjoy the walk down.REMINDER: Take water with you as there is nowhere to buy it when you reach the top!Instagram: @journeywithuss",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/journeywithuss
50,Lake Hollywood Park,"We went to Lake Hollywood Park good for a picnic a good view you will find the park at 3160 Canyon Lake drive if you have time you can walk up a trail to the sign, Car parking was road side only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teejay11
40,Easy way to see the Hollywood Sign,"If you want to take a nice picture of the Hollywood sign in the background of a selfie or group picture, while in Hollywood, go to the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Center at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. Go to the second level and walk to the back. You will have a nice view of the sign in the distance and there is a bench to sit for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FredInCalifornia
40,Really nice,"I have been here a few times, the hike to go there is really nice especially in winter or spring time. Try to avoid it in summer cause it might be super hot. It is a great place to take photos and the view from there is really beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F-F-7676
30,Hollywood sign visit,"Going to see the Hollywood sign was on my husband‚Äôs bucket list. We could have taken a rideshare to it but it was too costly from where our hotel was at. Everyone we talked to said that it was problematic to get close to it. Consequently, we decided to check it out as a part of a tour. Yes, we did see it, but it was at quite a distance. We got pictures and my husband was satisfied. It is more easily gotten to if you go to the observatory. We took a seven hour tour and it was one of the places that we saw. It was OK, but I thought it was a bit of a letdown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoPlaces64843
30,Iconic,"One can‚Äôt visit LA or Hollywood without seeing the iconic Hollywood sign. It is visible from many vantage points. As an internet search will tell you there are many routes to the sign. The Griffith Observatory is one such viewing point. There are trails to the actual sign but you must be prepared (water, proper footwear, dress & consider time required). Griffin Park has trails to the sign. Remember fences & no trespassing signs are to prevent you from touching or sitting or posing on the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JULOfrVan
50,Breathtaking views,"After living in LA for decades, I finally went up with my hiking group to the spot under the Hollywood sign on a beautiful clear day. The hike was not too strenuous and the view was certainly worth it. The group did not feel like going up to the top to the sign, but I liked the area so much that I went back two days later and hiked all the way up. There you have even more panoramic views to the ocean and the Verdugo Mountains. It is best to do this hike when it not too warm as there is little shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isaus2018
50,Business owner,Griffith Park up time the conservatory was gorgeous. Beautiful weather and not crazy crowded. Be careful where you self park because on the roads is not clearly marked no parking areas and we got a ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DABuehls
50,A Two Hour Hike up the Hill,We took a tour to hike up the trail up to the Top of the Hollywood Sign.Wear comfortable shoes and dress for a nice long hike up the hill.But the views are worth the hike. We could see Long Beach and Catalina Island from the top. Take a guided tour if you not a local and familiar with the trails. It is not clearly mark and you could loose your way.But the views are definitely worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556michaelc
40,Iconic landmark,"I think no visit to LA is complete without a closeup view of the hollywood sign, even it it's just a sign. Best place to get up close without hiking is lake Hollywood Park. You can also get up close and go for a nice scenic hike from Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimmaarouf
30,Okay,"As much as I would love to rave about this day out, for May the weather was awful and it poured with rain which ruined the experience but hey at least I can say I went to see the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD1984
30,Bring walking shoes,"To get a decent picture with the Hollywood sign, I recommend driving to Lake Hollywood Park. Parking is tricky but drive around, someone is always leaving. Once parked, head to the park, take pics and head up the hill as well. There are additional places to get great pictures. I found one with a tree to take a pic underneath so we wouldn't squint because it's sunny everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C221DVcarlosa
50,Actually visible from all sorts of places,Saw the sign while driving into the city from Antelope Valley and felt like I had arrived. Nice to see a landmark which is actually as big and bold as it is made out to be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
40,Iconic place part of History,We did the hike it‚Äôs an amazing view and not too hard.Its sad you can‚Äôt get closerBut you can still get a good pic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcardo
50,Do the Hike!,"YES, the hike is worth it to the #hollywood sign! And YES we hiked üèî it‚Äôs grueling 7.5 miles total from the #griffithobservatory to the sign and then all the back down Beachwood Drive .....it was exhausting ü•µ! It was scary üò±and steep in some points...but we are thrilled and feeling accomplished that we did it!!!If you aren't physically fit be prepared its rigorous in some spots. Be sure to bring hydration, wear proper foot wear and map out the trail you want beforehand (we learned from that mistake LOL)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drmindidelia
50,Beautiful,Beautiful view wish we could have got nearer would have loved to stand beside this well worth a tour to see this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caseykj42
30,Hike not worth it,From afar the sign is about what you expect however the hike up to the sign is a bit of disappointment if honest. Still had a fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wlaurence98
40,Good view during Day .. must see landmark,I visited Hollywood park to view hollywood sign . Its good place to view this sign and you can spend sometime there. there is also childrens area so child can play there. Parking can be challenging as many people visit the park so plan accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817jordanj

40,Nice sign!,"We were on AMG tours, so could only view it from the mall. You can go between the mall and take a nice picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielgkendall
40,Iconic,Can't go to Hollywood without seeing this iconic sign. It's really not much to it because you can't get very close but it was food seeing it. I have been to L.A sing the late 90's so it was good to see it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendakstarr
50,Must see- it‚Äôs an easy classic,Dreaming of coming to Hollywood since I was a child this iconic sign encapsulated the image I had in my mind. There‚Äôs several places to get a good photo- from Beachwood Canyon you get a nice straight shot and also from the Dog Park off Mulholland there‚Äôs a great photo op.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanas1
40,The spot for your hollidays photo,we just went to Griffity observatory and we saw the Hollywood sign from there. For me is more than enough for the best holidays photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedropD6354NC
50,CA trip,Walk/Hike was super fun. Just bring plenty of water and good walking shoes. There are different areas/trails that you can take. But typically we spent at least 3 hours walking up. So nice and went on a good day/weather. The day before we toured the other areas and the weather was a bit cold in the morning and was cloudy half of the day. But we went on a good day. We didn't do the Wisdom Tree. We were both tired by then. But will definitely do this again if i ever come back to California!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArizonaTravler2019

40,Great to see it,We saw the sign from the Griffin Observatory so it‚Äôs obviously quite a distance. Hard to get a selfie where you could read it but glad we were able to tick it off the list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailG701
50,View from many area‚Äôs,Depending on how close you want to see this iconic Hollywood sign will depend on where you view it from. Our son lives on Beachwood Drive which is where you can see the sign as you drive up the street. Several people take selfie photos on this street with the sign behind them. Our son took as for a walk to Lake Hollywood and you can get a good view from here and the dog park that is up this way as well. I don‚Äôt know of the walk up to it that other people are talking about. Be aware that this is a suburban area and as you wind up the streets can get very very narrow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharpeze
40,Hollywood!!!,My family-friends drove to Griffith Observatory for us to see LA from the top. Parking is around $10.Quite smoggy on our day there. We walked over to the side of the Observatory hill that faced the Hollywood sign.Can come to LA without seeing the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynnS290
50,Worth the hike,"We did the hike in the middle of summer, but was surprisingly not too bad. We were very red and watched others (probably locals) walk up without breaking a sweat ha! The walk took us about 20 minutes up at an average pace, we ubered up and down for time purposes.The view is incredible, you can see for miles on a good day.If you‚Äôre in town and have 1,5-2hrs to spend some time getting up and down I highly recommend. You can also walk from Griffith observatory but we didn‚Äôt have time to do that",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251
30,There are better places to hike,"Obviously the Hollywood sign is iconic, and taking a picture from behind the letters is fun but once you get to the top there isn't much to do except go back down. I'd recommend skipping for Griffith Park/Ferndell trail and then you get to explore the observatory at the top and you'll still get a great picture of the hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danaelisabeth
50,Great hike!,"The hike up from to the Hollywood sign via Canyon Drive is one of my favorite activities in LA. It's a moderate climb offering great views of the surrounding area on your up to (or down from) the Hollywood sign. It's a fairly popular hike, and not very shaded. I would advise that you get there as early as possible. 7 am still allows you some parking spots at the bottom of the climb, but I would shoot for 6 am as the light is much better and not as crowded. It's a fairly unshaded trail, so make sure you bring your hat, sun block, and plenty of water. It's listed as a 5.7 mile hike (there and back) but we are fairly experienced hikers, so we complete the hike in about 2 hours. Mind you, we also don't stop and gawk at the view as much as the other people. If you don't want to do the entire climb, you can can hike to the viewing platform about 1 mile from the sign, but the selfie opportunity at the top is much better. The trail is also dog-friendly, so expect to meet a lot of Hollywood pooches along the way. I have also hiked this trail in the late afternoon, and the views in the early evening are quite stunning. Be warned that the park at the bottom closes at sundown, so plan your visit accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyledda

50,Iconic must see,We went to the Lake Hollywood dog park for a view of the sign as recommended by others on TripAdvisorGreat spot. We were up early making the most of still being on UK time so it was quiet and easy to park 9amSpent a while just sat drinking it in. Took loads of photos. Be careful driving up though as you pass some beautiful homes that are probably fed up with tourists driving manically round their quiet streets! Even teenager was impressed ü§£,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cnash1
20,Not worth the hype!,Just my opinion. It took forever to get there and the view is nothing special. You can superimpose your pictures with the sign in the background without wasting all that travel time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jm1l771

20,Inaccessible,The only place to really view the sign from is the freeway as you're passing at 8 miles per hour. There are a couple of back streets where you can fight your way to the top through traffic but it's not a whole lot better View.

30,Great experience,"Hiking to the Hollywood sign was a great experience to me and my friends. All of us hiked to the sign for the 1st time. Remember to wear sunscreen on a sunny day and wear a hat; otherwise, we might have gotten sunburn. Bringing and drinking a lot of water is important too. We enjoyed our hike but there were plenty of horse üí© and made the hike stinky!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/890vmk

30,Difficult to visit,"You can see it from many places in town, also from some of the stops at Mulholland Drive, that offer nice photo motives. However, to visit the sign is more difficult. Car parking close to the Griffith Observatory is very difficult to get during peak times, from where the path towards the sign starts, and a walk through the huge Griffith Park takes several hours. In summer heat conditions not to be recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalbob2016

We got there around 2:00pm on a Friday afternoon. There was still plenty of free parking and people were everywhere taking the usual photos. Everyone has a different strategy, selfie-stick, timer on camera, asking a fellow tourist, shooting from the ground, jumping in the air, or posed straight on. If you have extra energy you can even hike up the street to get a closer, albeit more desert like shot. What does it all really mean?

30,Is the hike worth it?,"There is a large fence around the sign. The closest you can get to the sign is above and behind it. It's best seen from a distance in front of it. However, if you must see it up close, it involves hiking in the hills. Go early to get parking. It gets very crowded in the summer and weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imjuditha
50,Have to see!,If you're going to LA you have to see the famous sign! I recommend going to Lake Hollywood Park for the views. There is free parking and you can see the sign really well. You can also hike close to the sign from the park. Be aware the neighborhood right under the sign HATES tourists and they do everything they can to make it difficult to see and park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garypeto

Oh well, it is a famous sign and photo op, but I‚Äôve taken many photos of it in the past, using the sign as the major backdrop. I can‚Äôt get excited over the sign. It is most special to first time visitors to LA. I‚Äôve been here over 100 times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnaYYZ

30,Viewed From The Observatory Hill,"Not sure if Google Maps took us to the best and closest viewing point.With our eyes we could see the sign but hard fir the camera to see well.Parking was US $10 for 1 hour.In hindsight we could have jyst parked up for 5 minutes jyst before the car oark, taken our photos and moved on and away!",
50,Good hike up to the sign,"The hike up was pretty good, though hot. It is really good for photos and views of LA but nothing of interest along the way. The hike takes around 2 hours and 8 kilometers.",
50,No.1 attraction in LA,"According to locals, when LA was first under development the estate agents were trying to sell new properties near a new area called Hollywood. They installed this iconic sign to show the name of the area. Who would then believe that a couple of decades later it would become the No.1 attraction in Hollywood! There are many tours especially designed for taking a good close picture of Hollywood Sign. I would recommend either to take one of those tours or rent a car to get close to the actual sign. Don‚Äôt rely on Griffith Observatory as it is too far! Of course, a picture with the Hollywood Sign is a must while in LA!",
30,No big deal,"Apart from being an iconic sign board, the Hollywood sign board is really no big deal. You drive up. Take a look around. Take a photo. You drive back down.",
50,Can see it from a hike or on a homes tour,This sign makes Hollywood such a special place. It gives locals their identity. It shows tourists what they came to see. You can‚Äôt help but smile every time you look at it.,
50,Sign,It is a sign. It is big. It is cool. Some pranksters once made it say Hollyweed. That was really funny.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawband

50,Hollywood Sign evening tour y,"We did this hiking tour late evening with Jen & Ziggy (AirBnb Activities) and it was awesome. We found the best spots to take pictures, had a wonderful guide with amazing stories of Griffith Park, the sign itself and the surrounding areas. Our guide also took some awesome pictures of everyone in the group.I am so glad we went on a guided tour instead of doing this by ourselves as we learnt so much and had so much fun on the way.BTW - the sign is HUGE - you just need to get close enough to be able to tell. The tour all the way to the hill above the sign is highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nemi_42
50,You have to see it!,Well worth going on a tour so that you can get to see the sign. It is now cordoned off so you can‚Äôt get to the bottom of the letters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyBaker65
50,Hike to Hollywood Sign,"Joe was our tour guide. He was informative, funny and had great customer service. It was a beautiful day to hike. It took 2 hours to and from the sign. Joe talked about different sceneries and explained every detail. He also picked up trash along the way! That shows character and how much he cares about his job and enjoys it. He gave every family their share of photos and he was our personal photographer for the moment. I highly recommend his tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandgirl_80eight
50,give it 5 stars for being the one and only icon,if you can get close enough and a great view that is always fun. the surrounding area has some really nice homes but of course it can be windy roads on hills to try to get up close,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsyMiki

40,"8,700 student FCCLA conference",You can see sign much better from Hollywood. The angle is much better than the from the observatory park. It isn‚Äôt as large as you would think. TV and movies make it much more fancy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baybug2012

50,The most photographed sign in this country,"Why is this nine letter iconic sign so attractive? This sign that stood over a real estate development in order to attract and sell tract homes. This sign that originally read ‚ÄúHollywoodland‚Äù yes, that‚Äôs what it said. This sign that has been redone many many times and now is fenced off so it can‚Äôt be graffitied again for the thousandth time.. this is an L A iconic landmark.. go see it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrk9789

30,Another over-rated Hollywood attraction,"Just because it is a well-known Hollywood icon, people make a big deal of it, but visually, I did not find it particularly impressive. The best views I got of it were from the Griffith observatory. The history of the sign is more interesting than the sighting of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bbbass1

30,Quick visit,I though I could drive to the sign get a picture and be on my way. Had to park a decent ways away and come to find out it was behind us and the observatory is how to get a close picture. So I took the below pics and went about my day since my time was short here. Next time I do want to hike the trials and make a day out of it. Cool aight to see and something else checked off my list of things to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-Farias
30,"Unless it rains, it is a hazy view!",We viewed the sign from many locations on our vacation. But wished it would have rained to have got a clear view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/145missyr
30,I WISH THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO NOT BOTHER THE NEIGHBORHOOD,"(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) There‚Äôs no way around it, you kinda have to be ‚Äòin the know‚Äô (aka lots of Google research) to get to two main spots for prime photography glory‚Ä¶ or three if you count hiking to the lookout behind the sign. There‚Äôs no real signs pointing out the path or saying where to park. However, there‚Äôs most likely a little crowd of people going back and forth doing the same thing - just follow.THANKFULLY, WE HAD A LOCALNormally, I wouldn‚Äôt care about the Hollywood sign, but we were staying with my relatives whose neighborhood is beneath the sign, and I love hiking. We passed several small groups of people who were confused where to go (my relative would give directions). I understood the neighborhood‚Äôs frustration at the wandering tourists and wanna-be models, but I also know this is not a ‚Äògated‚Äô neighborhood either.BEFORE YOU GOThe walk from Lake Hollywood Park (where many cars park) to the back of the sign can take almost an hour. There‚Äôs no bathrooms or water fountains in between. Plus, you‚Äôre hiking through people‚Äôs neighborhood - kids, families, yards, etc - and I saw some loud goof brains who didn‚Äôt care about anyone except their selfie. The hike up to the viewpoints and behind the sign are all uphill, but the majority is paved and relatively kid-friendly‚Ä¶ except the lookout behind the sign where it can get a little steep and there‚Äôs danger of falling far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pyra-Danny
50,A dream ! Gorgeous views.,Go at sunset. Energetically very strong place. Must see in California and LA. City looks amazing from up top. Beautiful scenery. Really cool to hike. Loved it. Go by Uber as high as the road goes . It is not that roads are closed. Pull the gate hard and you are on a good picture spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizkaf2017
40,Had to be done!,As expected lots of people. Drivers are very considerate in the area.Personally loved looking at the homes in the area.Met a local who gave us information about the movies shot in the park and previous owners of some of the house. He also gave us some advice on places to visit for our stayed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H9267ZFsarahl
30,Not What I Envisioned,"On TV it looks like you can get much closer to this sign than you actually can. We had a view from Hollywood Blvd and then tried it from Griffith Observatory. It was quite foggy/smoggy (couldn't tell which) so we never got a good pic. Overall though, I'm glad we saw it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom2Twincesses

30,You can't really go close.,It's pretty cool to see. But it's a bit worn down and you can't even get close to it. Your time is better spent elsewhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15kristaw
30,Great views from a distance,"The sign is Iconic, but you are only allowed to view it from a distance, or take a long trail winding around the mountains to view it up close and you are still bared from hiking right up to the sign. The home owners under the sign have blocked off any roads leading directly to the sign. There complaint was the excessive traffic. My response is ""You knew where you were buying a house and you complain about the traffic"" There is an observation area above the sign but that's seeing it from behind. Don't dare hike up to the sign unless you want to deal with the authorities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhotographerJames

30,"Seen it, photographed it.","You've got to visit the Hollywood sign when in L.A. just so you can say you've seen it. We didn't hike up to it, just viewed it from a popular viewing spot.

50,Great place to hike,"Having been to LA and the surrounding area a number of times, I had only seen the Hollywood sign from a far. I really fancied some urban hiking so looked when I came across a hike to the Hollywood sign an easy decision was made to do just that.We parked up at Canyon Lake Drive at the start of Innsdale Drive without problem. We followed directions as found on Hikespeak and specifically 'hollywood-sign-hike-innsdale-drive-mulholland-highway-mount-lee-drive'. Instructions were easy to follow and afforded excellent close ups of the sign and we ended up after a little bit of climbing behind the Hollywood sign with views over LA which was really cool. Our return hike took a couple of hours and we walked approximately 8kms/5 miles with 275m of climbing. It was a fantastic short hike to a great travel icon and I'd recommend it to anyone with a moderate level of fitness, especially on a clear day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H75travel
40,Good fun walk,"Great fun to see the sign and especially to go behind the sign. Make sure you ask the way, we managed to take every wrong turn possible and make it a lot longer than it needed to be. Good fun though and great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjwgl1878
50,Best place to see it for photos,For the best photo opportunity get an Uber taxi or drive to Lake Hollywood Park. You will see the sign clearly and then walk up the hill road around the park which is obvious when you are there for closer views. Keep walking into the housing estate and go between the houses (ignore road signs) and you can get closer still. Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrahamEastSussex
50,Great short hike from Griffith Observatory,"We parked at the bottom of the Griffith Observatory and hiked up. It was great (very easy hike even with small children), and not very busy.

40,Hard to locate,"I used several Google maps directions to get close. In the end, I made it, although there's not a unique approach. I found it from the Griffith, I approached it from a park with horse opportunities and in the end via the lake Hollywood park. It's a characteristic of the city although it is overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanthopo
40,Further away than anticipated,"I thought we would be a little closer for picts. You view the sign at the Griffith Observatory, this was a stop on the tour we were on.

30,"A Must Do, But Choose the Best Way to See It","There are many vantage points for the Hollywood Sign, but in my opinion the best place to view it/photograph it is from the Griffith Observatory. Unlike many of the other vantage points, there is ample parking, bathrooms, and beautiful views of the entire valley (on clearer, non-smoggy days).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillK427
20,Not so wow,The most famous sign can be seen from Griffith observatory. But didn‚Äôt look any great. Just very plain and not lit up after night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanitha108
50,Walking the Fire Trail - PAY ATTENTION - TAKE OUT YOUR EARBUDS - SNAKES -BEWARE,"Haven't hiked around Lake Hollywood or near the Hollywood Sign in a while, but wanted to advise people to pay attention and take your ear buds out as you walk/enjoy the scenery to avoid an unpleasant or dangerous encounter. We've had a lot of rain this year so there will be more food for wildlife and ultimately when the flora dries out, more fuel for fires. The ""more food"" for Wildlife DOES include rattle snakes. Years ago, this time of year, walking with my friend and two large dogs, we NEARLY encountered a rattlesnake. We didn't see it, I'm sure it was hiding in the brush, but it must have seen us because we heard the rattle. . . which is the warning. . .and it was REALLY CLOSE. When we heard it, we high tailed it out of the area. If you happen to see as opposed to hear the rattle, please know that the smaller the rattlesnake the more dangerous they are. Don't get close. I dont want to discourage anyone from the walk/hike but PAY ATTENTION, take out your earbuds and as you listen to birds/bees/make sure you listen for any rattle too. As a native of L.A. I can tell you for ME, this area is the only area where I nearly had a snake encounter. Be safe on all your hikes. . . especially here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foodaspoetry
50,I can always find my way,"What makes the Hollywood sign great for me is when I think I am lost somewhere down near the Grove, Melrose, or Fairfax driving around and I need to get back to the Valley, I just point my car in the direction of the Hollywood sign. Helps me get to Laurel Canyon and over the hill to Studio City. It's a great marker, and grounds the the fluff of Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shuggiplum
50,Great place to chill out.,"As a huge fan of Hollywood, we had a plan to come here last month. From the place taxi drop you, you must walk about 30min to a nice place where you can make nice pictures. Although I am not really interested in walking, a little bit hard, tired, it's really worth. Many nice photos with my girlfriend. Great place to chill out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annastanek

We were going after the after a college graduation ceremony in Long Beach and were stuck tracffic in the evening and were late by 10 minutes. The tour guide waited for us.The tour can be little hectic and long, as you have climb up to the sign. But did not feel that we were tired. We took about 3 hours to complete. Our tour guide Joey was great and entertaining He took 100s of pictures for on the way and entertained us. We also got to know that he used to live very close to where we live now.Great tour and great tour guide.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charudattab2016
50,Go to Lake Hollywood Park!,After speaking to locals we were told that the best access to the sign could be done through Lake Hollywood Park. Not many people know this and locals try to deter you by putting up signs saying 'no access to Hollywood sign'. Trust me when I say ignore these signs they are red herrings. Continue to Lake Hollywood park and park on the hill and then its a short 10 minute walk to the best viewing area. Absolute must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattt379

30,It's just a sign people!,"You can go out of your way to see it or can see it as part of a drive through the area, which is what I did.

We went as a group activity and it was nice to chat with friends while walking. The views around the trails were very good, but it was kind of sad when we saw the smog down there in LA. We can see Hollywood lake from the trail too. There was no shade so we put on sunblock lotion and wore a hat. There was no restroom near by, so we only drank water after getting down and ready to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raylingc
50,Worth the drive through the park,"On a foggy morning in LA you worry that you make the effort to drive through LA traffic and wonder if you will even get to see the sign. But if you time it right and the sun comes out, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. There is limited parking so be prepared to walk uphill or alternatively stay in the car and drive as far as you can and you will still get plenty of opportunities to take that shot. It is tick a box tourism but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlackandBlue67

40,Iconic,"The Hollywood signis iconic and you can‚Äôt visit Hollywood without a visit. Fortunately I had a view of the sign from my hotel room. Sadly it‚Äôs not illuminated at night, that would have sealed the deal!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loriz1031
20,not an actual place or destination,"This isn‚Äôt actually a destination, as you have to trespass on both private and government property to get close to it. No parking, no gift shop, no official way to visit it. Trespassing is illegal and it disturbs the residents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChromeAce
50,Lovely hike and amazing views!,If you love hiking and happen to be in LA I highly recommend going for a hike up to Hollywood sign. I used Hollywood sign walk tour which had 5-6 people and the host/guide was amazing! We went all the way up to the top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citrocity
50,Hollywood Sign,"This is worth it every time, we got up as close as we could and paid a local for 5 mins of parking access in front of their property. Took some amazing pictures and moved on. I can't guarantee this would be ok with most of the locals but this particular person could not have been cooler about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlgj77
50,Awesome view,Hiked all the way to the top of the Hollywood sign and it was such an amazing view. Kind of steep going up but very worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLMario7589
50,Private Tour,We did a private tour that included getting us very close to the sign with a fantastic spot to take pics. Thanks to We Love LA tours!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAG1968
40,Nice view,Pretty good view. A little boring for teenagers. They cannot get near the sign! Good quick trip. Note that they are closed Monday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda_B109

40,Hollywood sign! City of Stars!!,"It was a dream to see the sign which we always seen in movies or TV only. And being close to the sign gives you the feeling of being up with the stars, up and close.There are various ways to experience the same depending on ones situation - you can watch it from Griffith observatory or do some hiking to get more close to the sign or maybe some cycling but whatever way you do it you gonna love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefastfurious
50,Hollywood,It's the freaking Hollywood sign! Enough said! Had really good weather when I visited it so no complaints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orcadas
50,Everybody comes to Hollywood....,This wasn‚Äôt on our hit list but we are really happy that we got our tourist on & took the trip out to the Hollywood sign. We signed up for a 3hr tour which took us up to The Observatory which gave us a view of the iconic sign. It‚Äôs pretty cool how you can see the sign whilst driving around town! Really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollascope
30,"You can hike to it, but cant get to it","You end up at the top of the hill looking down at the letters but they are fenced off. You cant get any closer, worse there isnt a good picture to instagram your presence",
50,For the ultimate photo,"Use google maps to take you to Lake Hollywood Park. Don‚Äôt despair, continue traveling up the winding, narrow residential road, up, up, up. You will eventually see the sign and a flat park on your left. Parking is free along the road. Once parked, continue to walk up the winding hill for the ultimate photo opportunity with the HOLLYWOOD sign. I almost decided not to attempt to find the Hollywood sign. I‚Äôm so glad that I crammed it in and did it! It‚Äôs ICONIC!",
40,Many ways to see this Hollywood sign,Many ways to see this Hollywood sign beyond Hollywood streets...1) Hike up via Beachwood2) Griffith Observatory3) Hike up Runyon CanyonDo try different modes. :),
50,Booked a plane for one hour to see all the exciting areas,"We started at Torrance airport and paid 250‚Ç¨ for two of us. And then Gary was our pilot, he flew extra deep to see the villas and pools and showed the Hollywood sign, we made thousands of photos!It was the best so far, we really recommend to do this tour- it‚Äôs every ‚Ç¨ worth! And 1 hour is a lot, you see so many areas of Los Angeles and the flight is great üëçüèª",
50,Hollywood Sign,There are several places you can take a picture of the Hollywood sign. We found the best spot was from Lake Hollywood Park. We also got a good shot from the Hollywood Forever Cemetary. We didn't have time to be hiking around neighborhoods so the Lake Hollywood was the ticket!,
50,Hollywood Hike,"We hiked up the Hollywood sign, and spent the night before in a local hotel. The hike up was really nice, maybe a little longer than expected, but good exercise, good weather, and a nice view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBeedo
50,Great Hike!,We did the longer hike but it was perfect for my two teenagers and my husband and myself. We took some water and some sandwiches and just took it slow. The scenery is beautiful and you get a great view of the front of the Hollywood sign. Starting around 9:30 in the morning was perfect because we were done before it got to hot. Would definitely do again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamrick75
40,Family Spring Break,Iconic visiting the Hollywood sign! We walked as close as we could! Great Views! Hollywood Hills are beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizzy815
50,Beautiful view,"My daughter and I had the most amazing time walking from the Griffith Observatory to the Hollywood sign. We parked for free at the Greek theatre and took the bus (for $0.50 per person each way) to the location. You can park closer for $8/hr. The walk was absolutely beautiful and a great workout!! I would recommend taking the trail that leads to the front of the sign. If you take the one that leads you to the back you only see the back of the sign from a distance because it‚Äôs surrounded by a fence. We went a little late and ended up getting to the sign as the sun was setting. It was beautiful, but we had to use the flashlight on my phone to walk back. Thankfully we didn‚Äôt see any rattlesnakes, but we did have to walk carefully both ways due to so much horse crap all along the walk. Apparently they do horse rides to the sign and nobody bothers to clean up the enormious amounts of dropping‚Äôs. Despite that I would definitely do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B3754IIannettem
40,Iconic picture opportunity,We didn't go all the way to the sign but we did go part way to get a good photo OP. There are great views of the valley and city. The sign is not lit so try to go during the day to take a pic. Lots of huge houses of the rich and famous around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momof2boyz2015

50,Great hike!,A must do in LA! We took an Uber as far as you can go to get great pics. We had a nice walk down and ordered another Uber! It‚Äôs a good walk and cell reception is spotty - you might have to walk further than you want!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/countryclubber
50,Hollywood,"Hollywood sign Travel is not difficult Can drive up to see nearby The area will have an observatory. That collects devices about stars and stars, including ancient clocks Can see Hollywood signs for a while If you want to see near, you have to walk a little further. But the weather is quite hot Should prepare sunscreen equipment as well Above is water available. Considered the highlight of the city that came to Los Angeles and had to take pictures We can see this sign from across the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nog914

50,A Challenging Hike,This is a wonderful place to visit. The park and observatory areas are being refurbished and parking even close to the top is a challenge. There is ample free parking at the bottom.The trails to he sign take about 2 hours each way. The zig zag in and out of canyons and some parts can be steep. You MUST take plenty of water.Completing the hike is very satisfying and the views are amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robin_Knowles
40,An American Icon,If you visit LA you have to catch a glimpse of the iconic Hollywood Sign on the hills. There are options to pay for a hike up close to the sign but there are plenty of good photo opportunities in and around LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/-Guzzis-are-ace-
50,Great hike!,"We walked and hiked the 4 1/2 miles (total) to see the Hollywood sign. Totally worth the breath taking view. Especially on a beautiful, clear LA day.It‚Äôs truly a hike. You‚Äôll get a good workout. It‚Äôs not for the unfit individual.But you‚Äôll see a lot along the way.Do it! So many photo opportunities along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaholtz1972
50,You HAVE to visit this,I hike up the hills on my final morning and I‚Äôm so glad I did as the views were incredible.It‚Äôs a bit of a steep climb so be prepared for a bit of a trek but it was so worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulgilly1980
50,Quick hike up to the hollywood sign,It was THE place I had to pay a visit. Easy parking at the bottom of the short hike. Threw a toy drone (tello) up in the air to get some cool shots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolframgamma
50,Do it,"If you don‚Äôt like to hike, it‚Äôs not as hard to get to the sign. We simply typed in ‚ÄúHollywood Sign‚Äù into the GPS and it took us on the residential route. By taking that route we actually came down to Lake Hollywood Park. We parked along the side and took a picture in the field. You can actually hike along the road a little further up and still get nice pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Honestihgmember
50,A Must See Iconic Sight,"When in LA, a must see attraction, especially knowing that certain stars sponsored the replacement of the old sign. Great photo opportunity.",
30,So far away,"We so wanted to visit and take pics by the sign. That didn‚Äôt happen as you are no longer allowed to go anywhere near it. Very sad and for the amount of security, they should let you go much closer.",
50,It's a lovely View,"If the weather is good, go up there and have a relaxing day, because it's very calming and you can see the beauty of LA",
20,Hmmmmm?,"It's a BIG sign on the side of a hill, the tour is way overpriced for what you get....If you really want to see a BIG sign go look at TargetüòÄ",
30,Difficult to get a good view without zoom lens camera,We trusted Google Maps to take us to the Observatory and saw the Hollywood sign from a distance where taking a selfie was a bit of a challenge.It is still great to see this icon of the area!,
50,LA landmark,"You cannot be in this lovely city and not visit the Hollywood sign!The view itself is amazing, but i have to warn you the way up there is steap and filled with sharp turns but its worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HusamHaopsh
50,"Awesome, got some of the best Pics from our Trip","The best way to view the sign is to got to Lake Hollywood Park, an idyllic public space with views of Lake Hollywood. There is street parking along Canyon Lake Drive that‚Äôs never restricted and a decent vista that doesn‚Äôt require any hiking at all.You can get get great pictures here but if you want to get closer to the sign, walk up Mulholland Highway until it turns to dirt, you will reach another great spot to take pictures here, ignore the bins which block the road.From here you can hike the 1-mile, somewhat-strenuous route to the top of Mt. Lee, which puts you behind and above the sign. This is about a 1 hour walk up and 40 minutes to get back down.Absolutely great views of LA from here, numerous people trek to see the sunrise. Not many people try the route so it is not too busy, mainly because many sites state it would take longer than it actually does.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SinghUK
50,Seen from all over Hollywood,There is no need to go to the sign as it is visible from all over Hollywood. A classic place well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donh941
50,Loved it,"We got an Uber to drop us off near the sign, and we hiked up as near to it as possible. It was a lovely sunny day and there were lots of people. It is such an iconic sight and is well worth taking time to visit it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliE155
50,LA Tour,This is the best way to see the Hollywood sign up close. Our tour guide Wynter Spears knows her way around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmarquez67
30,Tough walk. Cool view.,My 8 year old son and I climbed the mountain to the sign. We are both in good shape so we took the dirt path instead of the road up. Lots of scratches and cuts along with plenty of smiles and laughs. It will be a treasured memory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricG1313
50,Lake Hollywood park,But of a drive to get to Lake Hollywood Park but nice to see homes in Hollywood hills and great views of sign when you get there. (lots of other tourists). Go to viewpoint just above park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sienaDevon
50,A must!,"If you‚Äôre visiting LA then it‚Äôs no good seeing the sign from a distanceI hired a car for the day and had great fun in trying to find the best spot - you can head to Griffith observatory but everyone does that...wind up the residents and drive up the tiny, bendiest streets imaginableAll joking aside it is a spectacle and you have to visit it at least once in a lifetime, it brings it all to lifeI found parking near the observatory and wandering up and down the walks were great fun and exercise plus you get some real close up imagesI would advise not going first thing or early evening as weirdly it got quieter at lunchtime - perhaps all the residents and tourists were stuck in the LA rush hour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mongreladam
50,The reason you visit,"Huge, globally recognised and brilliantly located overlooking Los Angeles, the Hollywood sign is one of the reasons why people visit the city. Marking the city as the film-capital of the world, each letter is 45-foot-tall and imposing. For the best photographs, make sure to visit North Beachwood Drive and continue all the way up the hill to West Mulholland Highway. Great snaps!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gkw09
40,Iconic Hollywood landmark !,"No trip to Los Angeles would be complete without checking out the iconic Hollywood sign. We viewed the sign as we took a tour through the Hollywood Hills, checking out the current and former homes of the stars at the same time. Not to be missed !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/92stem
50,Susanadana,We saw it from far away but the update was that there was vandalism and some misfits painted the letters o into letter e's to spell hollyweed. Lol. That's why Hollywood letters look nice and bright,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75fatty
50,For sure you should shoot a pic there ;),"Very nice . But only for 5 min max . 3100 canyon lake drive is exactly the best location . Almost empty, there are no people there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariiaRussia94
50,One for the bucket list,Everyone knows the Hollywood sign and seeing it should be on everyone's bucket list. Its definitely a must visit site and everyone should see it at least once in their lifetime if they can.The sign is so much bigger then I imagined I believe each letter is 45 foot high by 33 foot wide. That's massive üò±. Go see it people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALCBS
40,Long walk,"It was a long walk up the mountain just to get to the back of the sign , bit of a bus mans holiday for me as my job is making signs . The view from the top makes the long tiring walk worthwhile . We took a taxi ride there and it is difficult to get back if you don‚Äôt have a taxi no . We phoned yellow cabs and still waited forty minutes for it to arrive . If your in Hollywood you have to see the sign. It‚Äôs worthwhile but tiring",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevchezza
40,Iconic sign seen from the Griffith Observatory,"Trying to decide the best way to see the sign , we ended up taking the road to the Griffith Observatory. There was another route through a neighborhood that our driving friend couldn‚Äôt find again so we joined the crowd at the Observarory. That was a pretty drive anyway ! When you get to the top, it‚Äôs in the distance but still right there to view. If it‚Äôs the closeness to the sign you desire, you‚Äôll have to find another way but you get to see it easily and the full backdrop of the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celticcutie
50,Nice,It was as expected. A big sign on mountain. You need a good camera to capture the sign & your picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mukeshg9
50,What a hike!,"We started our trip at Lake Hollywood park and decided to walk up the road to get closer to the sign. We got super close! 8.5 miles later on an amazing hike around the Hollywood hills, through streets with some amazing Hollywood houses we finally ended up at Griffith park Brush Canyon Trailhead. Super fun day. Even though it was 8.5 miles it was never strenuous. There wasn‚Äôt crazy verticals and the terrain was good. Regular sneakers were fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krissyalx
50,Iconic Sign,When you visit LA you have to go see the Hollywood Sign. No longer the original advertising sign for the Hollywood development. Another great photo opportunity in LA. You need to trespass on private land to get to the sign. I think we got as close as you can get legally. Some nice homes up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Amazing views,Went for a business meeting with a co-worker and made time to site see. We both really wanted to go here. The views were great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meyersfamilyof8
40,Welcome to Hollywood,Was amazed at the road condition to be able to get to the sign in how poorly maintained it is for such a popular attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccutting75
40,Tourist attraction but must see,If you have the time of course go on the hike to the Hollywood sign but if you don‚Äôt you can go up to Griffith observatory for a close look as well,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runawayblond
30,Just a sign,"It is iconic and a must see. , but its not that impressive as somthing you would need to look at for a long time or hike 8 miles round trip to get close",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chevyjlewis
40,Hollywood Sign with Palm Trees,The location is on Windsor Blvd between 4th and 5th streets.Literally pull & take the photos just like the other tourists.Try to time is for 30 minutes prior to Sunset to get the best pictures.I am guessing in 20 minutes more than 50 people come & went,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceowarren
40,Good with a car,"It's a shame that you can't get very close at all without going off-road. If you have a car, have a play on Google Maps, you can find some places pretty close to get a good photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattS921207
10,Hollywood Sign Hike,If you are going to hike to see the sign. Be aware that there are no bathrooms or rest areas. There is NO SMOKING at all!!! DO NOT LEAVE any valuables in your car. This area has a good amount of crime and tourists are targeted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccobbBoston
50,Really fun hike!,"This is a great hike to do in January. The weather was lovely - around 60F, just right for hiking. A lot of the hike is very open, so the cool weather was great. The views of the city are amazing as you go up are amazing too. The round trip is around 6 miles, so the perfect hike to do for 2-2.5 hours, first thing in the morning, then head for brunch.The place to start is at a parking lot on Canyon Dr (use 3200 Canyon drive as the address). The parking lot fills up fast, so get there early. There's one larger lot that's further away, and one that's right at the trailhead that's a lot smaller. There's also a lot of space to park on one side of the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3nvi
50,ICONIC,A great Hollywood iconic landmark. Interesting g story on the signs provenance and how it has become such a anchor for putting Hollywood on the map and burning an image in tourists minds. It‚Äôs fun to go up closet to the sign in the public accessible areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iCriticSD
50,Enjoyed Seeing the Sign 'Up Close',"It is worth the trip to see the Hollywood Sign. There is a place where you can take some great pictures for all views. The view is spectacular. There is even a nice park you can visit. Leaving the sign, be careful since the main road is very narrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180debrap
50,Best views & hiking trails,"We have combined trip Griffith observatory, where we have left the car, and then walked 4 miles. We liked the road, nothing 2 extreme, plus wow views to all 4 directions. Don't forget to take 1 liter of water. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddykgbs
40,A View Worth the Hike!,"One week after hiking to Eaton Falls in Pasadena, my girlfriend and I decided to take on one of LA‚Äôs most popular trails; that being to the legendary Hollywood Sign.Having lived here for just about three years now, I have seen the famous insignia countless times from numerous different vantages.However, what we were in store for was something much more extraordinary. Arriving shortly before noon, parking was scarce if not completely non-existent anywhere near the trailhead.After hiking through a very pretty neighborhood, we eventually landed at the trailhead, which consists of a ‚Äúclosed‚Äù gate (closed to vehicles that is) and a small directional marker.As we made our way past beautiful view after beautiful view, we noticed a gradual incline as the sign itself sits (nearly) atop a mountain peak. Because of this, the trail is considered to be more on the moderate side if not slightly strenuous. That being said, the path is well-paved, so even guests of little hiking merit should not deterred.With breathtaking sights aplenty (including Hollywood, Downtown LA and the San Fernando Valley), we finally made it to the summit ‚Äî or rather, the back of the sign behind a protective fence. We chose to see the view from this side first, so the rest of our hike would be downhill. The summit is fairly crowded and everyone wants a picture, so we encourage guests to be not only courteous to others, but also careful.After such an uplifting scene, we started to make our way down the mountain. We walked along a winding road, which eventually led us to the base of the sign. This plateau is the closest one can legally get to the front of the sign nowadays.After a well-deserved photo opportunity, it was time to turn around and head back to our car. I would recommend this hike to both tourists and locals alike. My only suggestion is to make sure to leave plenty of time as this is by no means a quick activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelKassel
50,Nice and Easy Hike,Start from the Griffith Observatory and make your way through the trails or the road leading up to the sign. Anyone can do itIt's not hard. Nice and Easy. 1 hour to and 1 hour back. You will also catch a good wide view of LA city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonFruean
50,Hollywood sign walk,"We spent a wonderful afternoon and sunset walk in Griffith Park, guided by Elizabeth. Elizabeth worked really hard giving us a fact packed commentary, and also shared her own experience of LA, and gave us lots of great tips for what else to do and see that isn't so easily come by in guide books/websites. I really recommend this walk and Elizabeth as a great guide!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritak723
40,Very nice hike to the Hollywood sign,We took the easy route hike. Not hard at all. You can also just take it at your own pace. We were walking fast and still was ok. The view is beautiful and it‚Äôs a great thing to do on a Saturday morning. Expect about an hour to go up the hill and a bit less to go down hill. Totally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/criisgq
50,HOLLYWOOD!,"There are a few places to go to get a good viewing point of the Hollywood sign. We first went on a tour that took us towards Hollywood hills and the sign was quite far back and hard to make out in photos. While you walk along the walk of fame there are also some good locations there as well. Another location was mentioned to us with the best advantage points of getting good pictures of the sign, however we did not have the time to visit this spot so I would not be able to recommend it (I also can't remember what was said other than it is in a park?)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253lornam
50,Bucket List Fun,"Been there, done that now! It was fun to see the sign in person rather than just in pictures. We drove to Griffith Observatory to see the sign from there. We bought an hour parking pass ($8 per hour in 2019) from a machine on the road up to the Observatory. You leave the ticket on your dashboard while parked. There is a small lot for parking right at the building and then more parking along the side of the road on the way up. You can enjoy the Observatory while up there looking but I would recommend more than one hour. At the bottom of the hill is a park and ride lot ...you park and pay a smaller fee to ride up to the building on the bus. If I had known of that option, I probably would have done that instead to save money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2doglady
50,Been there got the picture,I actually got a pic from Runyon park. We tried to go to the Griffith Observatory but it was overflowing with people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizzpriss02
50,Nice to see,A must see. We took the DASH to get to Griffith Observatory for the view. Was worth the 50cents to ride. Large crowds but most people were friendly and courteous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/locohog
50,Hollywoodland sign,"Driving up to it through the oldest part of LA is certainly a challenge. The roads are steep and with the heat I would never attempt this on foot. The car climb is a spectacle in itself with numerous very old and unique properties that look like something out of Hansel & Grettle or The Wizard of Oz. You are in the first LA settlement. Reaching the closest point we could we parked to take a few pictures. A few minutes in we were approached by a local who proceeded to calmly tell us what he thought of tourists in no uncertain terms. If you go to the sign be prepared for no parking spaces, mini traffic jams, roadworks and resident challenges. It‚Äôs not easy but I don‚Äôt think it was supposed to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4942JBjohns
50,Hollywoodland,"As few people know the original sign read Hollywoodland and was the billboard for a real-estate subdivision built by LA Times publisher Harry Chandler on Mount Lee in 1923. Originally the letters were illuminated with 40.000 lightbulbs and flashing. A true billboard with an advertising purpose.A visit is fun and I still have pics of myself climbing on the letters, which was still possible twenty years ago before the area became restricted due to vandalism.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralphnaderson
50,very cool trail,"Went with a couple of friends. Got there about 11 am and the trail had people on it but was not overly crowded. the first third of the hike up is pretty much straight up but after that, the elevation gain is not as noticeable. the view at the end is worth it though. definitely, allow at least 3-4 hours and bring sunscreen and lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/constancescalia
50,beautiful site,this is a must-see sight. most perfect time of day to go is during the sunset the sky looks amazing parking a little hard but you will find it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laila94067
50,"Wisdom Tree, Hollywood sign and Lake Hollywood","Start early morning to watch sunrise up at Wisdom Tree, then hike to the hollywood sign was amazing..definitely recommeded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
30,Parking is such a scarce resource - Great view from Lake Hollywood Park though,Recommend to hike from the bottom and ditch your car somewhere else other than Lake Hollywood Park. Getting a lot is based on pure luck and Parking petrols goes by every other second to place fines. The most ridiculous ticket we ever got from LA city Parking was due to the fact that ONE WHEEL TOED THE LINE. That's crazy despite that we were in a legitimate lot and fleed the area within 30 minutues of photo taking. crappy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melvachia
50,Visited in Rain,Some roads were closed and restricted. Tried various routes which allowed very great views of this hill. Traffic was ok as it was raining on a Sunday!We did not climbed up to the sign - good enough for the awesome views.Driving with a Rental Car is definitely better.Guess it would be great on a clear sky.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13parism
50,Access via Hollywood Lake Canyon,We took a post New Year‚Äôs hike with friends visiting from the Dakotas and from Australia üá¶üá∫ We has a wonderful time hiking the canyon and taking pictures near the HOLLYWOOD SIGN!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karmynj2016
50,Turns out you CANNOT touch Hollywood sign,"Look for how to get to hollywood sign observatory in youtube before you go, is not easy! Or just take an uber.After you get there, you can go up to a certain point. PAY ATTENTION to signs in fences, you can be fined if you go certain point!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nemelek13
40,6 mile hike to the back of the sign,"Plug in address 3200 Canyon Drive to get to a couple of small parking lots right before the trailhead. We got there around 1230 pm and there is limited parking. Small parking lot on the right and some people parked on the road (which made it more narrow to drive). A little further up there is an even smaller lot (about 8 -10 spaces) on the left. When we finished around 3:30pm, there were a lot more spaces available. No tree cover on the hike, so it can get hot so be prepared with sunscreen, hat, and water. It's pretty much 3 miles up hill. Search ""easy Hollywood sign hike"" and there's a guy who has a video of the hike, turn by turn. I wouldn't call it ""easy"" though - moderate for anyone who is in halfway decent shape since it is all uphill. Great views when you get to the summit of Mt. Lee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimL88Travels
30,Nice hike. Lovely iconic location,We visited on a day when there wasn't a lot of people around. Drove 1/4th of the way up and found a path that led us up windy roads to the vantage point from which those photos were taken. Great view of LA to be honest. But all in all I was underwhelmed. Saw some houses on cliff edges though. Those were interesting... Taking living life on the edge to a whole new level.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oladob1
40,The 101 North View after Rampart,"When I was younger I would listen to Dragnet. On occasion the dispatcher would say something about Rampart Police Substation. Of course going up to the Hollywood sign is something I did years ago as a kind of an adventure. However, there is another view not many would notice. As you travel north on 101 you can see the Hollywood sign off to your right way off in the distance, but the view only shows after you pass Rampart. Continue traveling on 101 and soon the sign will be closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,Best Sign Access Is at The Vista/ Canyon Lake & Mulholland HWY,"If you want the best photo opportunity Google Hollywood Park. Just 50 yards above the park is the Scenic Vista, built by the LA City Council just for you. Its like a photo set for you, your friends\, family and selfies. Park on Arrowhead Drive, so of Tahoe, its a short walk away. Many great trails including to the Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Great hike for active families,We hiked from the Wisdom Tree to the Hollywood sign to the last house on Mulholland and down. Highly recommended for active families. The sign is iconic but few get to say they viewed it from behind. The best view is from the last house on Mulholland.,
30,A Cheap Board Sign with an abnormal gap between OO and D,"Great View from the top of the hill, but the sign,. H,mmm amazing that people will pay to see this very ordinary sign. The traffic and hassle to get up there is not worth it.",
30,Check it off,"Nothing spectacular, but view of area from Griffith observatory impressive. Parking a hassle and expensive at $10 for an hour visit.",
30,A nice place for memorable picture,"It's a bit hectic location especially the parking. You need to expect a challenging location especially when it comes to the parking. I planned to go there in the morning and I was able to find a spot. However, when I was about to take off, it was too crowded and parking was hard.",
20,Photo,We drove up to see the sign and get a photo. The road was narrow and crowded. Would not plan on spending much time here.,
40,Iconic,We were on a bus tour of LA and unfortunately we were not taken very close to the sign. Needed a strong camera lense to get a decent photo because with the cellphone camera it looks like a white spot in the distance. In spite of that it‚Äôs great to see the sign. We were taken to an area near the Chinese Theatre to see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kolletjie
10,It‚Äôs just a sign,Overrated. My teenager asked ‚Äúwhy are here?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure! Some how we were led to believe it‚Äôs a tourist attraction!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandcmk
50,Views from in front and behind HOLLYWOOD,"We had a great hike with excellent views of the sign nearly the whole way. The hike took us up and behind the sign where we got amazing photos of the hills, observatory and the city with the sign in the forefront. Very cool experience to be so close! There is fencing to prevent you from getting right to the sign, but it didn‚Äôt prevent us from getting amazing photos and enjoying the outstanding views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellewug
40,View from Lake Hollywood park,I think the best view is from Lake Hollywood Park. There is problem with parking and a lot of people come to take a picture of the sign there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RudySzymon
40,Sign up!,"It's a bit of a walk, but you can jump on a DASH. We just wanted a decent picture, not to get so close to touch but put a little effort into seeing it clearer and glad we did. It's iconic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckofcorby
40,Finally!,We got to see the Hollywood sign! Beautiful from below and above. Everybody should visit this place as it's an Icon for all of us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timothyeruiz
30,No real address but worth the drive,There is no real driveways or cell phone service or parking you have to kind of figure out your way once your 2 miles away from the place and then there is street parking enforcement which one is waiting to give you a ticket so it‚Äôs not really enjoyable once we get there spend your time down and take a picture of the sign from a few miles away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skillednomad
50,Take UBER or Taxi,"It is a really great place to Visit while you are in Los Angeles. But be aware of limited parking space or no parking at all, so I recommended take an Uber or Taxi, that way you do not need to wait for hours to search for parking space. The Best Place to take selfies or photos of Hollywood sign is the intersection of Canyon lake Dr and Mulholland Hwy. Perfect view to see the iconic Hollywood sign also a good view of Hollywood city too. Also be aware of unfriendly Neighborhood, they feel bothered, when they see large crows of Visitors. If you decided to drive up here you could find parking on the bottom of the hill. Also, the great view is if you walk down to Hollywood reservoir there is a very nice bridge where you can take perfect pictures of the lake and Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dacic68
40,its a must,"yes it is a must in LA, but you can see from so many places, easiest is from hollywood and highland shopping mall",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglaswilliamm
50,Cool to see it,Saw it from a bunch of different placesFun to look up from different angles to see itEnjoyed seeing at night too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parcapecod
50,close up in Burbank,"the sign of Hollywood is best appreciated up front. it's located in Burbank, at the hilltop above a dog parkwinding road up thru a high end neighborhood. it's in a dry area (think brush fire)park at the bottom and take a leisurely walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lakwatsera2014
40,a must-see from Lake Hollywood Park,"Go to Lake Hollywood Park, park your car (free) and walk around the road (simple) to get amazing views and shots of the Hollywood sign. A must-see in LA!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nounouaa
40,Hike to the Sign! Best way to view LA!,"What an adventure. We decided to hike up to the Hollywood sign. And I must say, there is simply NO better way to see LA and Hollywood. Not to mention‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs FREE! Simply google ‚Äúhike Hollywood sign‚Äù and you will find all the information you need. We parked and started our hike not knowing exactly how hard or long it would take. I‚Äôm a marathon runner so I didn‚Äôt think it would be much trouble. Well, I was wrong‚Ä¶. Kind of haha. It‚Äôs basically 3.2 miles one way, directly up winding dirt path that spits you out behind the Hollywood sign. It took us an hour and 17 minutes to reach the top from when we started. Along the way we saw some of the most gorgeous views you will ever see. And did I mention this is FREE! We started very early, around 7:45am, as to miss a lot of crowds. On the way back down we saw a lot more people headed up. We had the mountain to ourselves once we reached the top. I‚Äôd love to hike the trail again, as you won‚Äôt find a better view. Not for the faint of heart, but certainly a pretty rookie climb to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonMcfly
40,A must see! Closer the better.,"If you want to get close its a bit of a hike......most of it is not rough ground but it is steep, so I would not recommend to anyone with mobility problems ( even minor ones).We took a guided hike, which was not really needed......as long as you know where to start then you can do it at your own speed, which is probably better, as our guide stayed attached to those who were walking at his speed.....we lagged behind a bit but got there in the end!It was very Hot..appx 30 degrees when we did it and I wouldn't recommend doing it in this heat if you can help it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/485gill
50,Canyon drive hike,"We parked our car in a car park on Canyon Drive. It was quite a hike, said 1.9 km but it was triple that and a lot of up hill. We‚Äôre well into our 50‚Äôs but managed it, even saw a Bobcat run across the oath in from. Awsum scenery on the way up. The best view of the Hollywood Sign and LA from the top. Highly recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracey30B
50,Great hike,We had a great hike up mountain opposite Hollywood sign. You can look down on the entire valley. Very cool. Drv up and down to mountain great homes to see built on cliffs. Amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/endosimon
40,Different.,"Felt so small compared to the sign at the top of the hill. Our uber driver took us as close as he could through windy roads, where we pulled over and he took a quick pick of us before cars came. Good to finally say ""Hey I've been there"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiJoJo5
40,ICONIC: Saw it from five different locations,Nothing is more iconic in this city then this sign. Not really worth going all the way up to it as it can be dangerous around it but looking at it from all kinds of places including skyscrapers is great fun. We probably took a dozen different photos to see from where we'd get the best shot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
50,Cool to see iconic location,One of the tourist must dos when in LA. Was great to get the standard photo. Found a place very close tot he sign with no tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentK570
50,must take some pictures,"We have found a a good place where you can take some pictures (lake hollywood) it is approachable by car, but if you want you can hike up to the hill as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418bald_b
40,Great hike and views,We took the hike up to view. As long as your comfy and have plenty of water it‚Äôs a enjoyable hike with plenty of views along the way. You get pretty close to the sign for your ‚Äúphoto op‚Äù,
10,What a Total Waste of Time,"Follow the signs to the top of the hill, find out that you have to pay for parking, only to be told that you can only see the sign if you go inside the overlook Bldg, only to see the sign from a longer distance than you do in any of the movies on the Big Screen. Unless you have time to kill, and money to burn; I would easily recommend skipping this site, and look for it on the next movie shot in LA.",
40,C'mon. Walk!,Bring water. Bring your camera. No service up at the sign so scratch the live feed idea you had. Great views of Los Angeles and the valley.,
50,Excellent View from Mulholland Drive,"When visiting LA, I had to visit the Hollywood Sign. The view from Mulholland Drive was excellent and provided a great photo opportunity.",
40,Hollywood Reservoir Walk,"This is a great circular walk with a fabulous view of the Hollywood sign, it's peaceful and a popular route for walkers and joggers.Park on Lake Hollywood Drive heading down hill near the gates, remember don't park over the red areas near the fire hydrants. If you look at the map you'll see two circular shapes at the bottom of this road.The path doesn't follow the reservoir completely and it comes out on the road and you just need to turn left, some areas don't have a proper sidewalk but it's perfectly safe.When you depart the area don't continue down Lake Hollywood Drive, you'll end up driving through the canyons which is terrifying when there is barely room for one car when you meet another one coming the other way. Turn round by the access gates to the reservoir and go back up the hill.",
40,A fun activity for a few hours,"We followed the advice of The Hike Guy online as to where to park etc. Easy. During the initial part of the ""hike"" you realize it is more of a walk on a wide path but that is ok. When we were there it was not busy. The vistas as you get further up are gorgeous. And of course the sign is cool although be warned you don't really get that close to it. It is also possible to walk to the Griffiths Observatory on the same hike and we saw a horseback riding stable that looked well maintained. The outing proved to be a good workout as the path is relatively steep. Do it and put another check mark on your travel bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristinaMingay
40,Nice views,We viewed he sign from Hollywood park. Definitely the best place to do so. Some great views from different areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
50,Breathtaking views!,"We visited the Hollywood sign and had direct access to it through a private tour that we booked. We were able to get extremely close by accessing a hiking trail that the locals use. The views were absolutely breathtaking! Would highly recommend, but to get extremely close, book a private tour!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TDDRN
50,Wow,Must see fantastic views & you won‚Äôt be disappointed a must see it‚Äôs a long walk to reach the sign but it is worth it to be honest you can get a good picture & view from the observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/659is
50,Amazing hike to the sign,"We hiked up to the Hollywood sign and it was spectacular. Definitely worth the hike to get not only an up close photo with the sign, and the view of Los Angeles is amazing!!! If you‚Äôre visiting definitely give it a visit you will not be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CostasDaGreek
40,Very nice hike,"A sing as a sign isn't that amazing, but you have to take the picture there :D. View from the top of the hill is amazing and it is worth hiking to the top. We took an uber to Deronda gate and hiked from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TikicaOs
50,Hike from Griffith,"If your in Hollywood either drive or grab an uber up to Griffith observatory. Here you can grab a bite to eat, fill up your water bottle and use the toilet before hiking some wonderful trails with great views and photo opportunities of the sign! Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
40,"Iconic Mark, Obligatory Photo",The Hollywood Sign has become the obligatory attraction to take a photo as proof that you were there and experienced the good weather and vibes. There are several ways of getting to the sign that can dictate how long you‚Äôd be at the attraction. Hiking to the sign or going through the residential neighborhoods to get closer make it a great experience to take photos are enjoy the scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdl07c
40,Perfect Spot for Picture,"We googled quite a bit and eveutally found this video of lady advising best spot to go is 3398 Deronda Dr, which leads to a garden (the gate may seem locked but just turn to open it as it is public entrance). Little walk up and you get great Hollywood sign view. Recommend if you're taking Uber to talk driver in to bringing you back (either cash or change destination to get back when you reach it) so you're not stranded. Be mindful the roads up are very narrow so traffic jams may occur. However worth it if you dont want to drive / walk all the way in for a good shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525atulc
40,Classic hike,Great hike for those who enjoy the outdoors. There are three main entrances for those willing to park and spend a few hours hiking to the sign (2 hours at the very least). Definitely a must see for travelers to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taylorzzzzzzzz
40,ITS JUST SPECIAL!!,"Some may think it is not much, but those are the ones that does not understand what it represents. Although, I could not get up close. I still enjoyed seeing it and being at the location knowing so much history within Hollywood. Also, the location is wonderful. This is part of Griffith Park so there is a lot of walking and climbing if you want to go through all of that. Or you can take pictures from the ridge as I did, and there is a nice restaurant to grab a bite. Big tip, if you have to go potty....skip the first rest rooms you see. The line is very long because it is the first stop. There are rest rooms in the restaurant and the lines are much shorter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleD357
30,Great to see,If you're in Hollywood then you must see the world famous sign but you cannot get up close to it without walking for about 1 1/2 hours (which didn't interest me at all). There's not much else to do around the sign either.Not disappointing but not mind blowing either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slothsrule
50,Excited!,"This was my first trip to Hollywood, and I was finally able to view the ""sign""! I did not get a close up view, but the view from one of the overlooks was great! We were on a tour bus. I was also able to view the ""sign"" from Hollywood and Highland. This is a shopping mall with stores, restaurants, the Dolby Theatre, souvenir shops, and touring companies. This is the ""happening"" place for tourists. Other sightseeing places here - Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossgool
50,Tourist,A sign ... it was nice to see it live of course but nothing really special about it. Just nice to realize it is real and not just from movies üòÇ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RanaTarek2014
30,nothing special,if you come to California because you watched movies and so well they are few thinks to remember.Hollywood is dirt and expensive.the sign is visible from everywhere and has a certain effect but What Is below is unbelievable not in line with name except the price.I would say the most dirt town in the world .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gca009
50,Yes for Hollywood sign!,It was nice when you come during morning and enjoy the view of the sign and the whole LA. It was a great experience for me to go there. A lot of tourists also. Wear sporty clothes. ü§òüèæüëåüèæ,
30,Iconic but waste of time,You can‚Äôt get anywhere close to it unless you want to pay a fine. It‚Äôs nice to go there an take pictures from far but trust me when I say far you will be very far from the sign. I gave it a three star cause it‚Äôs too far even for a proper picture of yourself for a memory.,
20,Rubbish,"One of the world's most iconic emblems, but very difficult to get anywhere near, unless you are planning to pay a sizeable fine. You can see it from tour buses, in the distance, and, in the even greater distance, Hollywood Boulevard",
30,Iconic but that‚Äôs about it,"Up close from near the base, just okay, can‚Äôt get right up to it, littered narrow windy road to get a close off view, better enjoyed from a strategic view point on Hollywood boulevard such as Dolby theatre. Most days invisible from rest of LA due to haze.",
40,Tourist Spot,"The hike to the Hollywood sign is intense, but very good for an active individual.A friend and I hike under the sign and hike around to get the overview above the sign. Please take water and a little snack for the hike. This spot is POPULAR with locals and tourist, but can be fun, if you get an early start..Enjoy L.A.Thanks",
50,A MUST DO,"You can‚Äôt visit ‚ÄúHollywood without going to see the shrine ! I mean sign . If you feel more energetic park on lake Hollywood drive and walk around the reservoir then continue up to the sign looking at the homes .After , drive down the windy roads into Beechwood canyon see some of the amazing homes and stop for a drink in Beechwood village . Bit sort of Englishy in a quirky sort of way .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coppeliatingley
40,You need at least one picture of this,This sign was seen on our tour (celebrities home) and we also viewed it on floor 4 of the Dolby building. The history of the sign is explained on the tour as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewel888
50,Have to see it!,You get a good view from the Griffith Observatory for the perfect photo op. The iconic sign is off to the right as you enter the Observatory grounds. In my humble opinion A trip to the LA area isn‚Äôt complete without seeing that sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MickyO100
50,SEE THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN,Must see the sign. While it's not as close as we'd want you still can get great pictures of the Hollowood sign. You also get to see Los Angeles from a different angles. Great place for tons of pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/971annettea
50,Great hike,Prior to coming to see the sign I did some research online and found the best way to see this sign was hiking to a certain area. We ended up in a residential neighborhood and out of nowhere there was this hat that took you to the viewing site. It was a great view. Perfect to take in January as it was a moderate 65-70 out. Pictures came out great and the view of Los Angeles was great too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellbelllll
30,The sign,You have not been to Hollywood unless you have seen and been to the Hollywood sign. It‚Äôs the symbolic image of entertainment to its best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissionGlobetrotter
30,If you like to hike...,"The city of L.A. (Hollywood is not a city) shut down street access to the Hollywood sign in 2017 due to traffic complaints by neighbors near the sign. So if you like to walk a lot and hike, you can still get to the sign. Or you can take a good zoom lens with your 35 mm camera and take decent pictures without the hassle of trying to get near the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
30,Cool,"Was cool to see this up on the hill. Not exactly a time consuming event, but its worth the time to seek it out and see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PTycz
50,Can Check It Off!,I‚Äôve been there and seen it and can check it off! We had to park ($6. ) and hike. But it was worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Page1977
40,Iconic Sign,One of the reasons we go to LA is to see the Hollywood Sign - its big its white and I have now seen it for real. My viewpoint was from the Dolby Theatre - second floor of a Shopping Mall - the glamour of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yandinazetland
40,"""The Sign""",The sign is actually better then on T.V. Parking is a little difficult though. I would definitely recommend seeing it in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackson321
40,Hollywood Sign,We drove by sign a couple times. The first time was exciting because we actually seen a sign that we always saw on TV.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindajQ5368PX
50,The Big White Letters on the Hill,"Been here before and got lost on the narrow streets/trails of the hill, but this time I found the perfect place on Mulholland Hwy to park and take pics of the most famous big white letters ever. As a movie buff, this is my Mecca :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petesza
40,The iconic Hollywood Sign,The iconic Hollywood sign can be in fact seen from several points around the city. From the Griffith Center it is supposed to be the closest point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap
40,Must-see,"This is a must-see in Los Angeles. You just stop at the view point, take a few photos and then you‚Äôre off again, since the sign itself cannot be accessed. There‚Äôs enough parking at the view point and driving though the Hollywood hills is quite impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293katrinr
40,Just like in the movies,"Finally laying my eyes on the Hollywood sign was a wow we first saw it when we went thru Hollywood Hills on our Hollywood and Celebrity Tours and it was such a beautiful overcast day the Tour guide said it was great great day with clear views,then we saw it when we got to our Hotel,Loews Hollywood we were on the 16th floor and had perfect clear view then finall when we were on Hollywood Boulevard walking down the Walk of Fame here is a perfect view thru the Mall where you can view the sign but all 3 views were great end of September and early October gave us such perfect weather to achieve comfortably all our Thene Parks and sightseeing activities",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11naomi
40,A great experience,"It really is a must see when in Hollywood, we enjoyed our tour which included the Hollywood Sign. One for the bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarissaInspired
30,A great hike and run; easily doable if you're looking for some fast tourist activities.,"After reviewing a number of websites that say you need to drive through random suburbia to get to the IDEAL starting point for the hike, my boyfriend and I did just that; finding our way to the top of the hill, after only getting lost once or twice. It was a nice morning for us, and we did it as tourists to the area on our first visit to the US. I do feel that it's not REALLY vital thing to do; it's essentially just a walk up a hill. While there are a number of great spots to take pictures, there isn't really any indication of where these spots might be; you have to just do the hike and keep your eyes peeled on the way.The hike itself is pretty easy and straight forward, and achievable for people with a basic level of fitness. We brought a small backpack with water and sunglasses, as well as long sleeves; as the wind can get a bit chilly if you're built up a light sweat.After reaching the summit and taking a few shots, we actually ran down the paved road, having hiked up a gravel pathway (after getting lost). The run down from the sign was lovely, and we found a great deal of novelty in seeing the roads and housing on the steep and narrow hills. To me, the run was half the fun of the trip, and if you have some level of basic fitness, I would consider doing the same yourself; something different to do as part of an ""Active Holiday"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessablundell
50,So much more than a sign,"Hollywood sign, it‚Äôs iconic and you can spot it from a bunch of places across the city, but for me the recognition came when I hiked up to it. It‚Äôs not an easy-straight forward hike, you‚Äôre high in elevation with great views, quite a long hike and at some spots you‚Äôre at the peak of the mountain with views both towards LA and towards the valley! Once you reach the top (which is actually behind the sign) you have right in front of you a fantastic picture shot! Totally worth it and beautiful, I would recommend you hike up there :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAss787
50,The Fried Squirrel is Great!,"I went to the Hollywood sign because I heard the food was great. My dad is Rambo, so I have keen tastebuds for the wild food selection on the menu that was created by Wolfgang Schmuck.I ordered the horse chips appetizer and was blown away by the pigeon sauce.After dinner we base jumped off the W letter, and paraglided down to the Tiki Xymposium on Hollywood Blvd and caught the late night feature with the family.This place is awesome!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gtrla
50,Had to see the sign in person!,"I know there are a number of spots you can visit to see the Hollywood sign, but our Waze app took us up Canyon Lake Drive. We stopped at several locations to take photos. Would not want to make this windy road trip into the hills in a large vehicle. There are places where it is hard to pass other vehicles, especially if cars are parked along the side of the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyW619
40,The Iconic Symbol,"We were so lucky to have a view of the Hollywood sign, the Iconic symbol in LA just from our room window. While our last visit to LA we stayed at Loews Hollywood hotel and we got a room with a view of Hollywood sign. Up in the hills, Big letters in white. It was cool taking photos and selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OsmanB511
50,Sights & a hike!,"Take advantage of the weather & hike up to the Hollywood sign! Depending on where you start from, it could be a harder hike or easy. The views from the top are marvelous! Make sure you bring your water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KtGirl1
40,Nice hike to the back.,Wanted to get a work out so decided to hike to the back of the sign and across to the wisdom tree and flag. Really nice but tough hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B787guy

50,cool hiking,if you make all the way to the top you'll enjoy the view. totally worth it once you reach the Wisdom tree though),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/462rainv
50,Sunset tour,Interesting to hear the history of Hollywood and see tbe iconic sign. Beautiful views and sunset. Good level of exercise walking up and down the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6282WGannm
50,Fantastic Hike to the Sign.,"What some would say is a very popular adventure while in Los Angeles, is a very fun way to spend 3-4 hours.One of the first things we both knew we wanted to do when in L.A. was to hike to both the front and back of the sign. It was an official tick off the box on my wife and my bucketlist. Now I can say we did it.We usued "" The Hiking Guys "" website and instructions on how to do it. We started off by driving to 2927 Canyon Drive and parking in the first lot. From there we started our climb. It was very easy to follow the path. Bring a backback with some water and wear good solid shows. There is decent elevation but it's not that difficult. About one hour up and less down.Best views ever!

50,Hollyweed,We stayed at a hotel in Hollywood over New Years. We were going down in the elevation and we could see the Hollywood sign in the distance only it said hollyweed instead of Hollywood. Some joker had fooled around with the sign. It was so funny and added a good story about our trip. I am a movie buff so seeing the sign was special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9179XXnancyf
30,"Ok, Average","We drove so much to see this sign .But there is literally nothing else to see other than those letters . May be because we drove around a lot exclusively for this sign , I felt this. There were boards placed in many places saying that google Map was wrong about directing them to this place .So just do your research before leaving .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rtneu
20,Don‚Äôt understand the hype,I understand what it represents but still don‚Äôt understand the hype. Wife wanted to go I wasn‚Äôt impressed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnkr14
50,A big fan of walking,"As a big fan of walking in different countries and climbing mountains this was a great walk, so many different routes but some amazing views, saw deer, coyote and beautiful landscape",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrekkingTony68
40,View from Hollywood Reservoir for something different,"It is just a sign, but an iconic one, and no doubt something that any first time LA visitor will want to see. If you are interested in a look from a different perspective, go to Hollywood Reservoir. View is better than at the main suggested spots (Griffith etc..) and if going mid week, you will have the place to yourself. Nice spot for a hike or picnic as well while you look at the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
20,It's a sign,"So, there is a sign, not a very elegant one, on a hill, not a very pretty one, overlooking Hollywood. No big deal, not worth a visit, in our minds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915ramiz
30,Tours.,A little disappointed with seeing the sign. You couldn't get that close to it on any of the tours. I guess you would have to drive there yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianepl1957
40,Hollywood Sign,We took a tour bus and he showed us around on the hills had a great time. We got to see several celebrities home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/babybubba
50,A great experience!,"We organize and chaperone a group of foreign exchange students on a trip to Southern California every November. We have been doing this for 11 years. Besides Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Universal Studios this is a major highlight of the trip. We have found a path that gets you really close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlesn822
40,Nice walk,We were up early and got a head start on the walk. We decided on a path and went off. It took 2.25 hours and we would do it again.It would however be nice if the Park Authorities would show what view of the sign you get dependent on the path you get; that would ensure that you choose the right one.Well worth the sweat and dust.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TroelsJ61
50,Icon,"What can I say about this Hollywood icon? It's visible from anywhere you are in Hollywood, and gave the area it's name, and, in my opinion, one need not walk up to it to enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Iconic land Mark,Went on a tour & the Hollywood sign was apart of this. Seen this sign numerous times when watching television in England & now I got to see it up close. Wow,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hitch1971
40,Viewed from Griffith Observatory,"We are able to see the iconic Hollywood sign from Griffith Observatory lawns. Other time we saw it was while doing the Hollywood Movie Star Homes Tour. As told, one can do tracking to reach the spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
30,viewed from Hollywood and Highland,With limited time in Los Angeles we viewed the Hollywood sign from Hollywood and Highland 3rd storey walkway. The sign was way off in the distance but it was possible to get a very good photo with both my phone camera and a compact camera. pity you cant get a closer look without hiking up the trail to the sign itself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddlerpants
50,Use the Griffiths Observatory as a viewpoint,"We viewed the Hollywood sign from the Griffiths Observatory.It has parking, a cafe at the Observatory if you want to get drink/food and lots of room to photograph and set up a tripod for pics.The parking in the car park at the top of the hill is quite cheap and there are toilets.It‚Äôs a lovely drive up to the Observatory too, with lots of pretty housing estates on the way up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655victoriak
40,Worth the visit,"There are lots of ways you can view the Hollywood sign-from far away or up close and personal.We chose the up close and personal route which was approx one hour 15 minutes each way from the observatory. I would recommend parking as far up the hill as possible.The route to the sign took us off road a couple of times and we were scrambling over rocks and up cliff faces - this is the way google maps suggested, however would not encourage this route for novice walkers. It was well worth the walk - the views of LA from the top are amazing.We took a simpler route back, which was well sign posted. Parking close to the observatory will cost $6 per hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarahd8119
40,Sister's trip,I was able to see the sign from my room downtown LA. I also took a tour where I was able to see a better view of the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharnise006
40,A landmark to see if in LA,"Saw this two times 2017/2018 from Griffith Observatory. Great site, great views, next time I will hike to the sign. But definitely a landmark to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amoureuse1976
30,It is what is...,It‚Äôs an iconic sight for sure but it‚Äôs a long way from anything (don‚Äôt try walking to it and there‚Äôs nothing nearby) and once you‚Äôve seen it the novelty wears off very quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kendoherty70
40,Beautiful Views,"We hiked the Burbank Peak Trail starting on Wonder View Drive. It starts off very steep so if you‚Äôre not relatively fit then I wouldn‚Äôt recommended this track, as it‚Äôs a short steep option rather then a longer flatter walk.Wear comfortable walking shoes as the track is mostly sand and rock so it can be slippery and hard for footing.It is best to either go first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon as the midday sun can be super strong and it gets extremely hot (we started our walk at 9am and by the time we were at the top it was 31 degrees Celsius).The half way point is a solitary tree with an American flag which houses some amazing views of the valley and surrounding cities.The whole walk took just under two hours for us, and we spent like 10mins at the top of the Hollywood Sign.You arrive to an area just above the sign, where you can see the back/top of the sign as well as the city/hill views behind it.I would have given it 5 stars but there were no bathroom or water facilities along the whole walk.I would do this walk again, though if you‚Äôre wanting shots of the Hollywood sign straight on I would recommend another trail.The website ‚Äúwww.hikespeak.com‚Äù was fantastic as is has all necessary information to do with the trails themselves as well as getting there. You can also compare multiple trails and view pics other hikers took for reference.Parking is free around the entrance.Good walking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb
30,eh,"This is nothing to write home about. This is merely just a place to stop and take pictures, then move on. Honestly I would have preferred to go to Sea World over this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelergirl96
50,Amazing view/ a must do it,Nice hiking place. You can go behind the Hollywood Sign. It will take about 2 hours when you are at Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthogx
30,Just a photo stop - nothing more,"Maybe, due to my high expectations, it was a bit of a let down. It is just a big sign atop a barren and rather nondescript hill. Need to take a cab ride to the point since tourist buses are not allowed entry to that area by local residents (who feel that tourists are a disturbance)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krishhere
50,HIKING TO THE BACK OF THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN,i finally hiked to the back as well as front of the Hollywood sign. It was an AWESOME EXPERIENCE....you gotta do it. We took the trail on Canyon Drive. The views are amazing. I really enjoyed the entire experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djmondo
40,Cool to see from a distance,Crazy trying to park when we drove up to the observatory to see the sign - so we came down to Hollywood Blvd and had a great view. Fun to view after seeing the sign in so many movie and TV shows.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altius10
40,Bronson Caves,"We followed Google‚Äôs direction to the Bronson caves. Once at the car park take the very short paved road, past the gates and follow the path for 10mins. Walk through the caves and you can see the Hollywood sign. It‚Äôs a lovely walk and a way to see the sign minus all the crowds!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/554wendys
50,Hollywood sign visit,A ride to the Hollywood sign is a life changing experience you can see all the way to Catalina .the ride is amazing and you usually run into the Sierra club a hiking group .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mackay13
50,Have to do this!,"We took an Uber from LA down town and it cost around 32 round trip. You can drive nearby and you‚Äôll spend only 15 or so minutes taking photos cos you can‚Äôt get all the way up there. Or you can hike from lower down which would take a while. Uber drive is about 30 mins each way. Just a tip ask the driver to wait , it‚Äôs very hard to get an Uber to collect you, so you‚Äôre stuck with a pretty long walk.Lots of walking and bike tours as well well worth going but book the tours in advance. If we had more time we‚Äôd have gone to the Observatory as well in Griffith Park which is a hike of I‚Äôd say around 1 hour or less.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354keno
50,This is Hollywood,"On 19 September 2017 , Well there is so many way to reach to place for photo with Hollywood sign I choice the close one by using this location on your gps or map ( beachwood canyon).I should try hike next time and you too !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAAlawadhi
50,SEE FREE HOLLYWOOD SIGN WITHOUT WASTING TIME,"Hollywood sign is a famous landmark and shown in various movies and is almost 90 years old.It is situated in the Hollywood Hills area of the Santa Monica Mountains. Each letter is 44ft tall and total width is more than 350ft.It can be seen closer by going on top of the mountain.However, we felt that it will be worth to see it from a distance to visualise the whole sign. This also saved us lot of time.We took redline Metro and got down at Hollywood/Highlands stop. After coming out from the Metro exit, we turned right for 30-40ft and found a mall named Hollywood & Highland Centre Mall. We used mall escalator/stairs to reach the top from where we had a nice view of the whole sign as well as the walk of fame, see my photos.After that we got down to next level, had a Starbucks coffee overlooking the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPMALLIC
40,Has to be seen,This sign is an icon and most probably the only sign known worldwide. As you get closer to the sign it can be seen from almost anywhere. I cannot explain why but this sign has something very special and must be seen when in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gincar2016
50,HOLLYWOOD SIGN,Amazing view of the sign and over L.A from 6000 Mullholland Drive. There is a sealed/tarred road that winds up and behind the sign for an amazing picture of behind the sign and over L.A. Well worth the 3 mile walk up there :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darleines
40,There is just something about it....,"It is just a sign, a sign made up of large letters, but there is something about it that compels you to take an obscene amount of photos. It is LA in a picture",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647kenana
50,Lovely view of the Hollywood Sign from Griffith Observatory,We had a lovely view of the Hollywood Sign from the Griffith Observatory. One of the best things about this is you get to see two Iconic Los Angeles Landmarks at the same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miz_emma11
50,Iconic Landmark,"you can't visit Hollywood with out checking out the Hollywood Sign, there are many great places you can take a photo from in the Hollywood hills but one of the best spots to take a photo is from the Hollywood & Highland shopping center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/57chevycustom
50,Love this iconic landmark,Easy to drive to. There's a great dog park not far from it. Lots of places to get out and get a photo of this iconic sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jedimommy
40,Hollywood sign in R.V.,"Western Canyon Road is where we parked with a 23 ft RV. We completed this route which resulted in us getting a good view of the sign, we walked an additional 1.8 mile to the summit which takes you behind the sign.So, we parked on Western Canyon Road, we read that over over sized vehicles had to parkat the bottom... we chose not to. It‚Äôs $6 an hour, which is charged between midday and 2200 hrs. So you could arrive early, do walk and leave before 12 and get free parking. From here, you could comfortably walk there and back in 3 hours, it isn‚Äôt arduous.From western canyon road, look at your maps and head to mount Hollywood Drive. Stay on here, you‚Äôll walk past a water fountain and turn left onto Mulholland Hwy. follow your maps on the phone, don‚Äôt get tempted to take a detour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidannetts
50,What a cool way to see the sign!,"We recently took our kids on horseback with Sunset Ranch Hollywood, to see the sign. It was amazing! Best way to see it and if you want to get even closer they have a trail you can walk up (maybe 8 min walk) but we were super close on horseback with amazing views of the entire city. Highly recommend seeing it this way over the hike. Plus they have a private gate and parking lot to leave your vehicle in so no worries about finding a parking space. And as soon as you walk up the small hill to the ranch- your at the sign. Amazing! Def worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SPSledd
40,Pretty Cool in Person,We hiked to the sign. It‚Äôs in Griffith Park. There‚Äôs a fence around it so you can‚Äôt get too close. It‚Äôs about a 7 mike hike there and back from the Griffith Observatory. Trails are wide and partially paved. It was a lovely day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674dianeq
40,Glad I visited,We went to the Griffith observatory park - we arrived before 12 noon so parked for free .We parked as close as possible and walked up towards the sign - the sign is miles and miles away but you get a good photo if you zoom in !It is a steep hill to hike up in hot weather but totally worth it . We were there about 20 mins taking photographs and then left .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissKimbo
30,A cliche but interesting,"Everyone has seen this so many times that seeing it in person is inevitably a letdown.Nevertheless, it is a cultural icon and worth a glimpse as you sit in a traffic jam that is L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfadds
40,Viewed from Shopping Centre,We viewed the sign from the shopping mall in Hollywood and got some pictures but then drove up to Griffith Park where the shots were much better.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karencA6283NY
40,A hike worth finding and doing!,The best way to get to the Hollywood Sign is start at Lake Hollywood Park. Hike up towards the neighborhood...you will know where to go based on the number of people doing the same thing. There is a YouTube video that also gives the details. There are 3 different open spots along the way for that perfect photo. We ended up hiking to the very top which is the back side of the sign. It is extremely hilly and enjoyed getting to the top. It is between 5-6 miles one way from the park to the very top. It was really neat to get close to this iconic sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WW809
50,1.5 Hr Hike,"We parked at the Observatory Parking Lot. From there we follow the trail to the Hollywood sign, is a 1.5 Hike, the first 20-30 min is mostly uphill and levels up after that. We hicked from the Observatory to the Water Tank ( I will give you the GPS Coordinates: 34¬∞ 7'51.88""N 118¬∞19'7.64""W because I couldnt find anywhere for the best spot for pictures so here it is) People usually were wearing sporty outfit but at the same time were people wearing sandals and jeans. Keep in mind is about 1.5 to 2 hrs depending of your fitness, also there are no trees or much shade during the hike so take sunscreen with you. Once you get to the sign you can take pictures and spend as much as you please. Coming back you can take the same trail or you will have to walk down the street through houses for about 30-40 min until you get signal. We didn't had signal up there. However that walk is easier than the trail and is cool to look at the houses you pass by, so you don't feel it so difficult. There is also a guy at a house that will rent you wifi or sell you water bottles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alprz
50,Worth the Drive,Get to the Lake Hollywood park view where you can drive to the top too.. the view from up there is so much better being closer to the sign.There‚Äôs a park there too for young children to play at the playground and grass area to have a picnic or just sit around and enjoy the view.Loved it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfaumui29
50,Exciting,The Drive up the hills to the Hollywood Sign & Overlook is a bit intimidating. The roads are super narrow so take your time. I was told by our Tour Guide that you can actually hike up to the sign as well. The Overlook of the city was beautiful. We went during lunch time the last week of August. Hardly any traffic. You will need to zoom in quite a bit to actually get a good pic of the Hollywood Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderLust23434
50,Hightlight to our trip,Definitely a must see. You can drive up to a great location for pictures. Very hard to find parking but its worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thaisgodinho
50,Strap on your hiking boots,"Be ready to HIKE. We arrive in the afternoon and had to park on the mountain leading up to the observatory. Parking is $8.00 an hour.There is a very narrow walking path up the mountain so if your afraid of heights or walking on the side of cliff then this might not be for you. Unless you arrive early enough to park at the observatory & then you can walk down the mountain to the Hollywood hiking path. I would suggest wearing comfy shoes and possible workout clothes. We had on jeans & sneakers but we seen ladies in heels & dresses walk to the observatory. If your headed to just the Hollywood sign be prepared to HIKE. The beginning of this hike is at a HUGE incline. I'm a runner & I was out of breath,it took about 1/2 an hour to get to the landing where the sign was in the distance. I'm sure if we kept on it would have been at least 45 more mintues to get closer to the sign. We only paid for an hour of parking so we head back, because we wanted to check out the observatory. Bring water & sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392cecilyb
50,Hollywood Sign Hike,"We did it during Labor day weekend. hikingguy dot com has nice details.The parking/starting point at 3200 Canyon Drive is same for the trek going to Griffith observatory and Hollywood sign. At one point right goes to Griffith park and left to Hollowood sign. The whole path is pretty wide, so not dangerous at all.You will see another fork almost reaching the sign- the left takes you to the front view of Hollywood sign, although still at distant, is pretty cool for pictures. The right, which may look counter-intuitive , because you are going opposite of the sign, take you to the back of the sign and the closest you can get. This right of the fork is the most strenuous hike but the destination is rewarding. You must see both.It took us 3.5 hours round trip from the parking lot , including time taken for photography. We started at 10:15 and started back at 12:15. The cloudy weather helped. I would not recommend doing it if the temperature is in 90s.I saw many reviews complaining about horse poops. Although there is a stretch of 10-15 min where there are horse poops, but the path is wide enough to avoid them. It shouldn't discourage you from taking this trail. Also, we saw more coming down, very less going up. So if you go early, you will see less of them.It's not easy but not difficult. The length and the steepness to go to the back of the sign, makes it moderate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gk2160
50,Bucket list,"The iconic Hollywood sign, need not to say you just got to go when you are in LA. Just a short taxi ride thru residential area and hills. Worth going !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joey85244

40,I love hiking,"We did a trail starting from the Griffith Observatory all the way up to the Hollywood sign. It was a lot of fun and came across a coyote and her pups. Made a few detours which led to some amazing views. The only downside is because of some vandalism on new year's, they no longer allow people to go all the way up to where the sign is actually located, but still a lot of fun and well worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evberduo
40,Great Scenery,"I forget the name of the trial my boyfriend and I did, but it was the ‚Äúshorter‚Äù hike that was difficult. The scenery was very pretty, but I recommend definitely being in shape if you do the trial we did.At the top the trail divides in two. One leading to the wisdom tree and the other to the Hollywood sign. The back of the sign wasn‚Äôt was impressive as I thought it was be, especially since I ended up with heat exhaustion, so be careful!!! The wisdom tree was beautiful! I enjoyed that more than the back of the sign!I still recommend the hike for the experience and view.Make sure you have LOTS of water, start the hike early, bring sunscreen, a hat and a snack!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekkaWolf
50,Best LA adventure‚Äîand it‚Äôs FREE!!!,Parked at Wonder View Drive and hiked up to Wisdom Tree and then over behind the Hollywood sign. The views are incredible. Great workout and challenging at times. My 15 year olds said it was the highlight of the LA trip. And after spending $300 to get into Disney ‚Äî that‚Äôs saying a lot.It was awesome‚Äîbring water!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explorer602064
30,Day out to Hollywood hills and area,Nice if you can get close enough. The roads to it are closed off and the one we had on our sat nav took to a private road where you can‚Äôt park so you have to drop family off they walk up the road and then you come back and collect them. The locals living there don‚Äôt like it at all some are abusive to people walking up the road even though they don‚Äôt own the road besides that the view is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Giantour
30,Hiked to Back of sign,"View is great.Back of sign is underwhelming.Hike is steep and in the blazing sun on a boring asphalt road (last mile and a half).Better hikes around this area - Mt Hollywood itself was awesome (great views, not the peak with the sign though, easier hike on nicer terrain)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanpO8064QQ
50,Must see,So I went to the observatory to see the sign. I was disappointed because the sign was too far away and of course my camara sucks lol. I had fun tho.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShiningTree385
50,Sign,We walked up so far to the sign but was worth it was a hot day if you decide to walk it put on decent walking shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondie1973
50,Fantastic View of Los Angeles Iconic Sign,"This is the world renowned Iconic Hollywood Sign.one of the best hike so far as i did this with my kids.Trailhead Address- 3200 Canyon Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90068- To Reach the Sign for best possible photos. (Walking involved)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajShivakavi
40,Worth the Hike,"The view is outstanding and very rewarding when you reach the top. It's a fun way to see the sights and get in your exercise. If you're not going with a guided tour, make sure you read the signs/maps properly or you can end up in the wrong direction with a lengthier destination.Note: Bring comfy shoes and plenty of water, this isn't a short trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannab276
50,Run there ... it‚Äôs worth it,"On a business trip I ran from the Observatory to the Hollywood Sign. I think I was the only one, but I can recommend it.Take the longer way up (about 7-8km) and the shorter way back - about 5km. Be aware - it gets hot - do it early in the day.A great challenge - do it !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilipKSmith
50,Great.,This is worth the time driving up into the hills to get a little closer.We googled advice where to go in the car which got us really close with places to park so you get the money shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidecarmark
40,Even from a distance it is exciting to see,The sign and the city are inextricable. A visit to LA without a glimpse of the sign would be incomplete. There is nothing beautiful about the sign itself. But its place above the city with its slightly crooked lettering tells a big part of the city's story. Worth a look even if just from a tour bus window.,
50,Photo taking stop,If you in the area then you gotta have a photo stop with the sign in the background. Iconic of the area,
40,Hollywood sign hicking,"It took us 4 hrs to get to the sign. We park pass the old Los Angeles zoo. There are really no signs but some maps but after that you are on your own and at the end we got there because you could see the sign far away and some kind of hicking trail that then divides and you have to make a choice of which one.to take. Take 2 bottles of water at least. Once you get to sign start walking down heal and get a cab or Huber, it‚Äôs really nice area around .",
40,Iconic sign stopoff,"We were able to park close to the Griffith observatory, and the parking meters were out of order so it was free (bet they've fixed it by now though). You're still quite a long way from the sign from there.",
40,The Iconic Hollywood Sign,Our easy way to view the sign & get photos was at the Hollywood & Highland Center Mall. The mall is located in Hollywood on the northwest corner of Hollywood Blvd & Highland Avenue. Go to the 4th floor and the sign is behind you in your photos on the walkway. In front of you are the Hollywood Stars. There was a parking garage in the basement of this mall that was easy to get in and out.,
30,Don‚Äôt Go on Monday,"We went on a Monday, and the observatory was closed which means there was no place to park except down a long winding road that you pay $8 for on the roadside only to take a long trek back uphill. If you cannot park close to the sign, it is not worth it unless you want to do some hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
50,Closets way to the Hollywood sign is parking at Lake Hollywood Park,"Just wanted to advise that the closest way to get to the sign on a car is to drive to the Lake Hollywood Park. There is parking on both sides of the road and the view is great for the picture opportunity. Remember, there is parking enforcement there all day long and they give parking tickets even for the parking in the wring direction. There is a short hike, where you can get even closer to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IlyaDer
30,The Sign,Of course if you go to Cali you must go see the sign. We drove on our own to the Hollywood sign. Driving to the sign is a bit of a zig zag drive. We went just a little before sunset where it‚Äôs not to crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaB815
40,Good View from Griffith observatory,I visited the Griffith Observatory with some friends I made from a G Adventures tours.The view of the Hollywood sign is very good from the Griffith Observatory. However it is smaller than it appears in media. What fun to actually see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2torontotraveller
50,Just so much fun!,"The Hollywood sign is beloved by Los Angeleans - it is pure silly fun. Glorious! Go to the Griffith Park Observatory, either walking up the road there or driving. From the top you can gaze at the Hollywood sign to your heart's content.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
50,High above it all,entering Griffith Park and taking the mini walking trails up into the hills makes you feel like you are a thousand miles away from the bustling noise of Hollywood and Los Angeles. It is a beautiful spot a place I have spent many mini wonderful hours hiking and looking out over the history of that is my home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadillacbluez

30,"Fun to see, but horrible to park near it","The Hollywood sign, it quite famous so making a photo with it is normal. But parking near the sign is horrible, there is almost no space left, and the leftover ones are usually really far from the sign.Overall the sign was fun to see, but parking near it was horrible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/octimuskevin
10,It‚Äôs a sign.....,Not as amazing as tv makes out. It‚Äôs a bit disappointing. Just don‚Äôt go out of your way for it.Not even that big.... strange it‚Äôs iconic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/legodude1983
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"The most famous sign in the world.It is a must-see when in Hollywood.Visible from all over the city, you can't leave without taking a photo of it.It once read Hollywood Land as it was a real estate advertisement in the beginning.Now, it is the symbol of Hollywood.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
50,LA trip is not complete w/o visiting this,Just worth the drive up to see a bit of this monumental sign of Hollywood. We didnt take the hike but a bit of a snap to see it is just enough to complete our LA trip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariehJ616WV
50,Picture perfect,"I mean it's exactly what you expect. There's a hillside from where you can see the Hollywood sign, you'll take pictures and probably go elsewhere after that BUT if you really wanna take it to the next level, you should go there at golden hour. At around 7pm when the sun is lower oh my God the light is picture perfect! With the right angle you'll look amazing and the sign will appear very clearly behind you. I promise it's so great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_salmaeliela
40,Very nice and famous place,"This is a very nice and famous place with a great views...You go there throught hollywood hills what is a beautiful.. yes there is a big traffic,but its really good to see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vlk777alfa
40,Iconic landmark,We could see this from Hollywood Boulevard and then took the Dash bus to Greenwich Observatory where the views are clearer and closer.Such an iconic sight and photo opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieM452
50,Classic,might be a little cliche but its still an amazing site. Theres so much to do around the sign the observatory hiking hollywood echo park silver lake thai town k town ..... must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaiahMichel
50,Great stop for some superb photos,We stopped and parked at Lake Hollywood park and walked up the hill a little to get some brilliant photos.Probably only stopped for 15 minutes but enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babesb79
40,"Tiring hike, but worth it for the view","Perhaps hiking to the Hollywood sign on a hot day wasn't the best idea, however I had a wonderful time with my hostel group and gorged on some great Pad Thai afterwards. The hike to the Hollywood sign is almost a rite of passage for tourists and locals alike, if visiting Hollywood put aside a few hours as this is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadartemis
50,Awesome,"Saw the sign from many different points but the most memorable that will stick with me forever is hiking to the back of the sign!You cannot take a pic in front of the sign at the top of Mt Lee but once you reach the sign it's like ""wow"" unbelievable!!!Really didn't think we were going to make it to be honest, thought it was a moderate hike, some parts were steep, very slippery and at the edge of a cliff! There's no markers, you just follow the path of footprints. Luckily there was lots of people on the trail to help us along the way.My best friend and I travelled to LA to celebrate our 50th birthdays, this was on my bucket list! We did it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FP7020
40,It is Iconic So We Had to Visit,"You can see the sign from a lot of places in Los Angeles. But we had to hike up as near the sign as we could. It is a climb and though the day started out cool, as the morning went on it became very warm and I hadn't brought enough water. The particular route we took brings you to an observation point near the sign, not to the actual sign. We broke into groups with the younger people moving faster up the hill. Passed a group of college students who were hiking up followed by a drone. We parked near the Griffith observatory and parking was hard to come by even though we got there early. It is something to do once, unless you are one of the people who passed us who do this every day for exercise, so you can say you've done it. Bring more water than you think you need.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiKershaw77
40,Just do it,"It is a bit of an adventure to get a good photo op with the Hollywood sign, but that becomes part of the fun. It is possible to get fairly close, but not in a park. I‚Äôm actually a bit surprised LA hasn‚Äôt set up a park the optimizes viewing from a reasonable distance.Head into the Hills and explore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuddyV_12
30,It's a sign,"If you're visiting LA for the first time, this would be a fascinating experience. But let's face it, it's just a sign that's part of history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naneliz
20,It‚Äôs a sign,"Very cool to see. However, it‚Äôs a sign you can see it form the city below. If you drive to the top of the mountain you‚Äôre gonna see the same thing. Don‚Äôt bother unless you‚Äôre headed up to the observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4622KQscottp
40,Great view on the sign and the city.,"This is a nice place to take a picture with the mythic sign. Not so crowded, and the scenery is very green and clean. Will recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilBKK
30,Just a view from Griffith Observatory,Sign is good but if you wan to get good picture then probably need half a day trekking or go closer to sign from other place but not from Griffith observatory. Good for click though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKS81
50,Great Tourist Attraction,I lived out in the LA basin years ago and there were times that the SMOG was so thick you could not see the sign. Things have cleaned up a lot since those days and the sign is easy to see from the LA area as long as your on the correct side of the mountain. There are many places that you can drive up the street that is in direct line of sight with the sign and have a better view that in downtown area. So do a little research and you can find a great place to see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OurTravelsGA
40,Hollywood sign tour,My wife and I took the grand kids to Los Angeles as a tour day getaway from our Las Vegas vacation. We decided to find the iconic Hollywood sign and take some pictures. GPS led us to the location and other Trip Advisor reviews assisted us in parking in the right place to avoid ticket and tow. The walk up the hill is very steep but worth the hike as we were able to take several really good pictures with the city in the background and the Hollywood sign in the background.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonydF1000NL
40,Saw it in the distance!,Can see it very clearly from the shopping mall on Hollywood Boulevard plus took a trip up Mullholland Drive and see it a bit closer. Can climb to it but we did not have the emery or time. But can you have a trip to LA without seeing it? Must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnselmColom
50,Amazing!!,"This has been on our bucket list for years!! We finally traveled out to California and spent 8 nights. It was an experience to remember. Although the sign is visable in many different locations, we chose to go to Griffith Observatory to see it. It was horrible parking and a long walk uphill...but I would walk it again! It was all worth it! The beauty of the surrounding areas from the top of Griffith was georgous. Once we got to the top it was very crowded but like I said, there are numerous locations, and it was all worth it! We went twice since the first time was so busy...the second time my husband and teenagers did the hike to the sign. They loved it. My 5 yr old walked up those hills like a champ. Go see the sign! It‚Äôs worth it! Go during sunset!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandim481
50,Bucket List!,"No trip to LA is complete without a photo op at the Hollywood Sign! Many people were stopping along the main road to jump out and take pictures wherever the sign was visible. The sign itself is situated in a neighborhood so there is no actual public place to visit. We put ‚ÄúHollywood Sign‚Äù into our GPS and it brought us through a very tight neighborhood. There was a gate on top of the street that we were allowed to enter by foot which brought us to a landing just below the sign. There was also a hiking trail but signs were posted to deter anyone from entering. I have read that property owners are annoyed with the tourists, but no one gave us a hard time. There were guards posted and they seemed to be there just to make sure no one overstayed their welcome. Have no idea what road we were on to get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Compass426977
40,Made it Hollywood,Enjoyed the people watching and walking down Hollywood Blvd. even was able to see a movie shoot as well that shutdown 3 blocks (Leonardo and Brad Pitt filming Once upon a time in Hollywood by Quentin ) went to Griffin park to get good pics of sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96minhv
40,Famous sign,The best way is to head to Hollywood/ Highland and go up the stairs to level 4 or 5 by Madame Tussaud's and take some nice pics of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathakali_12
40,we had to take a photo,feels like if you travel to LA somehow you must see and take photo close to that sign. We rented a car during our trip to LA and wanted to go near that sign by ourselves. ƒ±t s a private property and very narrow streets are going up there. when you arrive to closest point be aware that there i≈ü no parking place and you still need to walk like 300 m to reach view point. so you must leave your car in front of some private zones belongs to houses. If you are lucky like us you gonna find your car when you are back:) ƒ±t was a nice trip and we were happy to be there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/totoloz
30,Nice but difficult to join,Actually it‚Äôs a must being in LA. But there is the problem where it‚Äôs starts. During the week it is doable but at the weekends just try to avoid. There is nearly no parking available! To get to the sign you have to hike. The trail is a bit hidden behind a private gate. So actually a lot of people drive as close as possible and take a picture shot from there. At the dead end road is only a small turnaround spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323MarcK
40,Icon landmark of Hollywood & Los Angeles,"I‚Äôve been to Hollywood over 50 times, and new guest almost always wants to see the Hollywood Sign. I have a hard time to rate it above average but based on the high demand to see it, I‚Äôll rate it as ‚ÄúVery Good.‚Äù The Hollywood letters are a great photo op. I‚Äôve hiked to the sign. Doing it once, knocked it off my bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
40,Awesome To See,My husband and I visited as part of our Highlights Tour. Our tour guide was able to get us really close to the sign and we took some great pictures! It was beautiful riding up the winding roads and viewing the gorgeous homes as we approached the area. The hillside view was absolutely breathtaking. I think it‚Äôs a must-see for anyone visiting CA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/617crystalb
40,Gotta see it!,"We were able e to see THE SIGN, from Griffith's Observatory. It was pretty chill just getting to see it. Can's t go to LA without it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindy031
30,"I went, I saw and got a few pictures","I actually did the Red-line Behind the Scenes Hollywood tour and was able to snap pics of the sign, though it was far away. A good camera would capture it from where we were (it was an area near the Dolby Center). We then visited Griffith Observatory (parking for the observatory was 8 bucks and you still had to walk about a quarter mile), I had a closer view of the iconic sign. Zooming in on my shots, I can see the sign clearly. We did not have time to drive closer to the sign, but I was okay with the shots we got.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keishaw810
50,Where's the best view?,"The best view we found of the sign was from the Griffith Observatory, along with the best views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319helenw
30,The worst pilgrimage,"I saw the sign from the Griffith Observatory which gives you a slightly oblique view, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. It is so iconic and famous that you feel compelled to see it in person even though it‚Äôs just a leftover part of a real estate advertisement. So you drive out to a viewing spot, you take the obligatory picture of you pretending to either kiss, hold, or crush it depending on your views of the place and then spend the rest of your trip wondering if it was worth the gas money you spent doing it. So go see it, just don‚Äôt admit that you did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unavid
30,Big famous Sign,"On a clear day you can see the sign from a few miles away, but if you want the full experience you should take a hike up to it. Make sure you bring the right shoes and plenty of water since it can get very hot. You can also get a great view if you just drive up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lilia6987
20,Hollywood sign,We went to the hill to see the Hollywood sign we we got there and found out that you had to walk 1mile and walk it was 46cAnd you had to pay $5 to park per hourNot recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5591ZEalana
50,Great fun!,"A fun free thing to do in LA which is quite rare! There are several places you can view the sign from and many of them have free parking too. We went to Lake Hollywood Park and had a picnic which was really nice and the pics looked great! You can also walk up a little bit and get even closer to take photos. If you go to this park, you can park on Canyon Lake Drive for free but of course it does get busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJanes1511
30,Find a free walking tour to take a picture of it,"Free walking tour was not really free. You paid tips at the end. If you got a right one, you‚Äôve got a chance to hear the story about the sign and he/she would take you to the right place for taking a full picture of it. Not a fan of Hollywood, don‚Äôt bother",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monrabdog
50,Hollywood sign ticked off our bucket list,While we were in LA we had to visit the Hollywood sign! We were on a day tour and the tour guide was able to us quite close to the sign to get a great photo opportunity! Definitely a must when in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vikkir69
40,Worth getting closer,We took uber to the main gate. $12 from walk of fame. We started walking heading to the sign its about 40 minutes steep walk. It was hot and humid. We decided to return to the view from the gate. We walked all the way down to get later a uber.Its a nice view of L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyDayton_Ohio
50,Even better in person,I didn‚Äôt know what to expect about getting close to the Hollywood sign but it was amazing. Each letter stands 4 stories tall and it‚Äôs the iconic symbol of what this city represents.. Go Big or Go Home! The drive in the hills near the top is beautiful and it‚Äôs set near a real lake that‚Äôs a drinking reservoir. I am glad I checked this off my bucket list. Well worth the tour and pictures!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaydel4kids
30,Quick stop in Hollywood,Stopped in the town area of Hollywood and could see the sign in the distance shame we were not closer but we were on the way to the airport. Seen some Elvis models and stood on Donald Trump star on the path nice to see some of the star's as you walk along. Shop's and gift places and somewhere to eat and drink,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helensims61
50,California 2018,"Head for the park area by the sign!! (Lake Hollywood Park). Parking is on the road, but we found a space with little trouble. You can‚Äôt get much closer to the sign than here, and the photo spot is great! I would say you wouldn‚Äôt spend much more than 10-15 minutes here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/906petes
40,World famous,You can see it from afar and different places in LA but we went up to Griffiths observatory (very busy on 4th of July) to have a nice view on it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DidierNivelles
30,Uber there,"Didn't really fancy a hike in in 32C heat so took an uber to a viewing area just below the sign, it was as close as we could get with air conditioning",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sallndmark
50,Best hiking ever,"If temperature lets you go out and hike this is a must be adventure, once you reached up the top the view is breathtaking, a connection with nature in a world city is like best of both worlds",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiaHSS
50,Stopping by at Vegas,It was great amazing experience really awesome place for you guys incredibly friendly staff great service,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juscelinoa2018
40,Checklist,This is one of the things you just have to do if you go to California. It's not that it is anything fun like an amusement park but you can definitely make it fun. The drive through the Hollywood Hills was pretty cool. Tight fit. I recommend driving as high up as possible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganlucas09
50,Grest,This is Hollywood - drive up to the sign and find the little portal to step into magic - make the famous picture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennys34
50,Always a good hike,"Whether you‚Äôre a local or visiting, hiking up to the sign is a cool hour to spend overseeing LA. Cool views at the top. It‚Äôs always pretty crowded. The earlier you go the less crowd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linzerb709
50,Iconic Hollywood,"The SIGN can be seen from a variety of vantage points, and with a good camera, you could look like you are right there. But in reality, the closer you get the more exciting it is! You can't get physically up close, but that's OK because if you were in touching range you really couldn't see it because it is quite large. So the best view is up the hill on the twisty little road, which also offers great views of Malibu Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RecreationV
30,Hollywood ain‚Äôt all that üëÄ,"If you love hiking, I say go for it. In the heat and in 36 degrees I just couldn‚Äôt ever do it üòÇ Me personally had a private car to visit most places around LA, also to get close up in person to the sign in a car is kinda impossible, most of the people who live around the area are trying to put a ban in place for tourist as there is so many tourists around, vans and cars. It‚Äôs madness. If you don‚Äôt see it, you aren‚Äôt missing much. It is just a sign. But if you really really wanna see it, get a taxi half way up, get dropped off and hike the rest and definitely wear comfortable shoes üíØ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceallachain
40,Cool iconic sign,You've seen this sign hundreds of times in films and on TV. Time to see it up close and in the flesh. You can see it well from the park down below the sign. There is a windy road going up to the park and then when you see it for first time it's pretty special. It's only a once in a lifetime thing to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fordy2014
50,Famous,Take a few pictures. on the way to walk of fame near doubly theater. Take a lift to upper level and you can see it clearly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodjin
50,It‚Äôs just that!,"Ok so rating a sign...It‚Äôs a classic. Once you‚Äôve seen it a few times from the main road, something draws you to it - so we ventured closer and drove through the amazing streets and up via some astonishing houses to get the best picture we could.Worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlasgowCurryClub
50,HOLLYWOOD SIGN-HOT SPOT OF LA,"We take lots of friends from other countries to the Sign as EVERYONE FROM EVERYWHERE wants to take their photo in front of the sign. BUT, the best place to stop for the photo is about halfway up Beachwood Canyon, as the road curves and you will lose sight of the sign. You cane easily see the Sign and pull over to get some photos.OR, you can drive all the way up to the top. There used to be a small parking area, where we parked and hiked up to the sign. BUT, watch out, as there are signs to Beware of Rattlesnakes. I am not sure this is true. The signs may have been put up to discourage hiking up there. At any rate, we did not see any snakes. The irony is once you are at the top, you are too close to actually see the sign or to get photos of the sign, but you can get a great view of LA!There is also a charming little roundabout 3/4 of the way up with an old 50's style Beachwood Cafe at 2695 Beachwood Canyon where you can enjoy a nice breakfast or lunch, and a market next door to purchase snacks.This excursion is a MUST for every foreign visitor!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosegirl324
50,You cannot go to Los Angeles without visiting the Hollywood Sign!,"This is a must stop! If my travels take me close to LA, this is one place I have to stop! We just had a girls trip this summer and this was a great addition to our trip! Maybe one day we will do the hike! Right now we will view from afar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415kristenl
50,A must see!,A must see when in Los Angeles. Google the best street address to see the sign. Neighborhoods have put up signs that say ‚ÄúYou cannot see the sign from that particular street‚Äù These signs are mostly not true. The streets Avery narrow though. You can also get a good view form the Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Porterhub
20,Don't be fooled,"We thought if we drove to the top of the hills, we would be able to get a good image of the sign. This was not the case. We should have avoided the narrow, steep road and taken the picture from the base of the neighborhood below. I feel like we wasted 30 minutes of our day trying to seek out the best places for a photograph.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelleg436
50,Icon alert,You just have to see it and the best view is from the Hollywood lake dog park. It‚Äôs bigger than I expected and just as cool to see and say you have seen as I expected!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsutherl
40,No hike for me,"The Hollywood sign is so iconic! I wouldn‚Äôt take the 3 1/2 hour hike (one way) to get close, just take a tour bus if you must be next it. Look up good vantage points for pics",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaz428
50,I Saw It!,"I finally saw it! I have lived in San Diego for almost 27 years and have been to Los Angeles many times, but had never seen 'the sign'.We went to LA and the first stop was the Hollywood sign! It was awesome to see this iconic historical landmark in person! We could not see it up close and personal as there was a concert at the Greek that evening and traffic was crazy, but I saw it!I recommend seeing it if you find yourself in Los Angeles; it is fun to see something in person that we have all seen in the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navelring7
40,Probably just have to do this,"You know you need to see it. Once you do, you will likely have the same ‚Äúyep, there it is, let‚Äôs get a picture‚Äù reaction that most seem to have. Griffith Observatory is a good place from which to view the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoFryGo
20,Bit disappointed,"The sign seems small and doesn‚Äôt really stand out on the hill, no where really to get a good photo when you are on the bus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP4130
50,Finally!,"Finally got to see the Hollywood sign in person. There are different ways to hick or drive. Parking can be tricky, but the experience is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBMatt1147
30,A photo of a very distant sign,"Its iconic, a must do when visiting Hollywood. You need a telephoto lens to get the shot shown above, don't try and get a photo of yourself in front of it as you won't see it from the viewing platform they have. The incredibly small car park is full of buses that block you in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cathyandpeterw
50,Iconic sign,Just drove by but iconic to see. Can see from town just driving thru. Can do a hiking trip to see it closer but parking was a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kferrell1
50,"Iconic Landmark, Worth the drive to see",This was a fun trip up the hill to see this sign. It‚Äôs amazing to think of how large those letters are and how long they have been there! So worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kelly32963
50,It's a must see!,"At least once in your childhood you dreamed of seeing something extraordinary that caught your eye. For my niece the Hollywood sign was that ""thing"" she had to see. It was a great experience for her as one day this is where she plans to be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slgreen09
50,Hottest day ever!!,We hiked the 2 miles up from Lake Hollywood Park through the neighborhoods And in 109 degree heat made it to the lookout to the sign! So glad we did it - but mad we followed the rules and walked up when sooooo many people drove up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/569nannettes
50,Great selfie backdrop,You can see this sign from so many places from Hollywood to Griffith Park. Always a terrific backdrop. I can‚Äôt wait till they finish building the tram so we can go right up to the letters. Definitely on the LA visitor checklist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MapGuy414

40,Worth visit,"This was our first visit to LA and family was interested in the Hollywood sign visit. I opted to drive vs tour and I think it was a better decision.After reading few reviews on Trip advisor, i was able to find location for GPS to reach to the sign.It‚Äôs a good place to hike, carry water and wear comfortable shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavinPuri
50,Hollywood experience,We drove up North Beachwood Drive (& Franklin) one of the best neighborhood streets leading up to the sign in order to get a good picture. It was really exciting to see in person. Though I‚Äôm sure it annoys the residents the picture potential is perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CheersSacramento
40,Nice view of the sign,In the area and decided to get a better look at the sign. Drove some very narrow and winding streets to get up there and found the viewpoint with parking. It‚Äôs busy with lots of people coming to take that picture. We didn‚Äôt hike up as it was a really hot day and we didn‚Äôt prepare for a hike. We took some pictures and went of our way. Great views of the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canuckonthego11
40,2h of walking...,"This is what they do not tell you. It takes at least two hours to hike/walk up the hills and back. There are no toilets or water selling facilities on the go, so be prepared as it is HOT.You can cut 30min if you skip the front of the sign and just go behind. Much cooler view and close contact with the sign. Front will always stay too far for the effort.Backside rules",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joonas2014

30,Famous sign,"I viewed this sign from the Griffith Observatory. If I had time, I would have loved to hike the 3mi to the sign, however, viewing from the observatory was more than good enough.

30,Its Big. It's Iconic. It's on a Hill.,"I think everyone loves the Hollywood sign & it really does sort of embody the largeness of the city, it's land development, its primary industry and the expansiveness and vision of those who formed this sprawling metropolis.Is it worth the hike, drive or traffic to get there? Um, I really don't know about that. If I hadn't been with a good guide who took us away from the crowds so we could get a good view and some nice photos I don't know that I would've have bothered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookala
50,Good view,It was neat to finally see the sign up close. I like the ride to get there because you get a great view of LA and the many houses in the hills. Our guide asked if we wanted to got to another spot with a closer view but we were okay with the first spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erriad2017
50,Best point for view is 3000 Canyon Lake Dr,A must do if visiting Hollywood. Plan 30min for photos. The way up to the point is through windy streets with nice houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenGlesener
40,Worth the effort but not an easy sight to get close to,The best spot is at the Mall on the Walk of Fame road --- IF you are not one to hike or drive the winding hill roads. I had my mother with me and she has to walk with a cane so our best bet was at the mall. There's a bridge in the mall that you can walk on and see the sign. It's quite a distance away but you can get a nice picture of it. My son used the telescope and put his phone up to it and took some photos of the sign that came out pretty nice. To find the bridge just look for the HUGE elephants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mburbank2016
40,Cool,It really is cool and you got to go see it because it‚Äôs just part of the fabric of the city and there are many places to see us including the Chinese theatre and the Griffith Observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twin411
50,Must see,"It‚Äôs astonishing! Being there, under the famous sign...Awesome. But one tip: don‚Äôt go to the tourist packed place. Drive through the hill all the way up to Mulholland Hwy, park somewhere for a couple of minutes and walk five minutes.You will be able to enjoy the place quietly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oliveira_de_figueira
20,Traffic mess,If you are going to be a tourist you must drive to this viewpoint was my original thought. This trip maps directed me to a dead end street at the sign park. The street was narrow and difficult to maneuver with passing traffic. I felt bad for the police officer that was trying to prevent an utter mess of traffic. He would get the clutter cleaned and turn around to see another jam. We took a picture from the side of the street and that sufficed this time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000
30,Viewed from Griffith Observatory,"On a Tuesday in July our family traveled to Griffith Observatory to see the Hollywood sign and views of LA. We chose to go to the observatory based on recommendations found here on trip advisor. We arrived around 12:30/12:45 and it was packed with people. Cars were parked on the road leading to the observatory for a very long way. When we got to the top we found that they were not allowing people into the observatory parking lot. I‚Äôm still not sure why. So we parked and walked. The views of LA were good. The sign was easily and clearly viewed from here, though you are not close to it at all. Because of the distance, our pictures have a person up close with the sign in the background far away, hard to see unless you zoom in. However, I can not compare this to other viewing spots. If it is important to you to see the sign, this isn‚Äôt a bad place to go. Now that we‚Äôve been there, I‚Äôm on the fence about whether it was worth driving out of our way to see some big letters on the side of a hill. It easy just okay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMJBL
30,The sign!!!!,"I would say it is a bit overrated, especially that the access to it is limited, so what most people do is drive or take taxis to a few locations which give one the chance to take a decent picture with the sign in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eugen
20,A landmark crucial to visit and yet challenging!,"The Hollywood sign is Los Angeles landmark. There are couple of ways where you can view the sign and take pictures. There are videos on YouTube giving tips on how to reach there. However in order to do that you have to park your car and take a trail for a 20-30 minutes hiking to the top. It was extremely difficult task for my kids therefore we aborted the mission. The regular way is to drive in an extremely slow busy traffic and park your car, you can barely find a spot, and then walk to the observatory area and view the sign. I wish it was an easy process.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LovelyTorontonian
50,A must when visiting LA,We viewed it from Lake Hollywood. Adventurous drive. Get to see interesting houses a long the was. Amazing to see and take pictures. Just be ready for the curvy roads,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atank81
30,Would be better if you could still get close!,"Having grown up loving the whole Hollywood aura, it's a little disappointing getting there and not getting up close. Apparently fenced off due to vandalism. You would think the county would rather create employment and have security guards on site 24 hours a day on shifts so that the Sign wouldn't need to be fenced off and keep the attraction open for all the tourists and visitors. Still fun to see , great view from the Griffin Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grants976
50,Magnificent,"There is many places to view this iconic sign. One of the places we saw it from was Griffith Park, which was massive and very busy but plenty photo opportunities. A must see when visiting Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraf516
40,Be ready to walk!!,We went off of Franklin somewhere and follow what someone else had posted to get a great close up with out walking too much but it was still a steep climb (less than 1/2 mile) it was Saturday so super busy and parking difficult (but it was free),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSamanthaM
50,Why not?,Why not see it closer? Yes we did. It was nice to be able to get so close to it. Worth it. There‚Äôs a strict no smoking sign near the neighborhood and I wish some people actually respect it. No smoking PLEASE.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cristinaj179
40,Hollywood Sign,Seeing the Hollywood sign is a big part of visiting LA and I am glad we took the time to do it. We parked at the Hollywood and Highland shopping center and followed the crowds to a walkway on the fourth floor that has a good view. There were a lot of people taking pictures from there. This was a very easy and enjoyable way to see the famous Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoVols79
50,Loved it,Very hard to find to get good pics! It took us 30 min to find it! But well worth the travel!!! It‚Äôs a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandy-75253
40,Impressive,"We have watched it from several points of view. One of the best views is from the Griffith Oberservertory. Of course it is far, but as the sign is big, you can see all over it. We also have been closer (Mulholland Hwy), but the view from the obervatory was better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/romanshorner
50,Where to park for the best views,I have travelled all around Hollywood and the absolute best location with easy parking to view the Hollywood sign are:Griffith Observatory - perfect view and free parking for one hour.Barnsdall Art Park - perfect view of sign and Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
30,Whatevs,You can say you saw it. Appears in thousands of movies and TV shows. That's about it. Who cares? Next.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q5650EJsamanthah
40,Worth a visit,"This is a very good place to see the Hollywood sign. The drive up is an adventure in itself, through nice residential areas. Must visit when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/birgitteo777
40,Birthday bash,"We decided to celebrate my nephews birthday in Los Angeles and of course we had to see the Hollywood sign, is definitely a hike to get close to it but is not worth it cause you get the same view you get from other points, hiking to the top is definitely a workout and not recommended for people afraid of heights",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/984karinam
50,Just like in the movies,Don‚Äôt be scared of driving to a great view point and then walking to the sign. Either drive or get an Uber. Both are easy. Local folk have put up signs saying no parking etc but these are not official. Head to Deronda road and you ll be on the right tracks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/242dp
50,Aeesome,We saw the sign from the Griffith Observatory. I can‚Äôt imagine making a trip to LA and not taking the extra time to see this. It makes the trip seem really real!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blondi1517
30,Sign is too far!!,"This is a must see for tourists visiting Hollywood for the first time so why can't the authorities arrange to have a platform closer to the sign so tourists like myself can get a proper picture? We took a day tour from Vegas to Hollywood and the tour mini van (a seven seater) drove to a park where we took pics with the Hollywood sign on the hill in the background. If you're taking a day tour to Hollywood from Las Vegas make sure they use a small vehicle carrying about 7 persons because big buses aren't allowed to drive through the Hollywood area to take pics.The street can get busy with parked cars on both sides, our tour bus operator was chased by the police for parking in a no parking zone.It was good seeing the Hollywood sign in real life although it was far away. I have an idea, there are a couple houses where I'm sure you can get a good picture of the sign if you stand on the roof. Maybe those home owners can build a staircase and platform on their roof and charge tourists a fee to take a pic with the sign.You're welcome :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicaEmery
50,a place to visit to say you did,"i mean, it's not something i would have on my bucket list, but when we were out there, we did make sure we went and saw it (so we could say we did). we did not climb up, however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrifurn
50,Must see,This is a must see. We plugged in 3000 Canyon Lake Drive and found ourselves winding through very narrow streets but eventually coming to a large opening where there is a park and cars park along the side of the street. The sign is still quite a distance away but perfect with a good camera. We went midday midweek and found that it was not too crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy007
40,Really cool pictures,"Its hard to find the right spot, but the pictures are super cool! The roads are busy so find the dog park close to the edge of the mountain which has the best photos. Cant remember the name sorry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregTitaliano
50,Must visit,"Although the Hollywood sign is not as huge as I thought, it was very impressive to see them in reality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjoernl219
50,No need to pay for a tour!üôåüèº,I was about to take a tour when I read other reviews about the area and there is public parking on the shoulder on Canyon Lake Dr. There are patches of areas along the path perfect for photo ops! Beware of the steep cliffs in the area!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabstravelblog
40,Good luck,Finding the sign in person is a minor miracle! I was taken by friends and could never find my way back. If you do find it a great picture awaits! Selfie time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coleg230
40,Just a sign,"It's only a sign, best place to see from Griffoth observatory. Nice to see once and to get some nice photos to ahow friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hossamm894
40,Great Scenic Views,Great panoramic views of the Hollywood sign as well as a beautiful wide view of the city. Convenient bathrooms. Have to pay for parking. Depends on traffic may be a slight hike up several hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcpadie58
40,No close up view,Disappointed that we weren‚Äôt able to see closer but we still got some decent pictures with the zoom lens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lunchlandqueen
50,A must see,A trip to LA is not complete without a view of the Hollywood sign. There are many places where you can get a view including the shopping center near Hollywood and Vine with spectator platforms but even better is going to Griffith Observatory and walking the trails which have great views of the sign for photos. Classic Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SouthernBelles98
40,What can I say?,You will certainly look for a place to get a pic although cloudy sky can mess up the view. There are always guys on Hollywood Blvd that offer to take a good shot for a price. Don‚Äôt expect to go walk up to it like in the movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattiBethA
50,Love the View,"Our tour took us on the mountains to a location where we could take pictures. It wss an amazing view. We were, not able to be exactly by the sign, however close enough to get great pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/227kishan
30,any clue to access,we saw firts the sing from the Griffith observatory. we google the possibilities to access or to be close to the sign. we try two times in one day and was not possible and after just driving trough a private neighborhood we saw the sing and decide to parked there. we still don't have any clue to get closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susivonsoler
30,A view for a distance,This was our first visit to the West coast. You have to see the sing but do not get too excited.Plenty of other things to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe193
50,Exciting,"Beautiful my family ~ we were in an awe after seeing the famous sign it was just as we expected very well maintained, clean inviting and full of historical memories. We made sure to take as many pics as possible....my family and I were still reminiscing from standing gazing at the area overseeing beautiful LA.Thank you Rosa Brown",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip780605
40,Hollywood,There is a viewing area next to the Chinese Theater where you can see the sign but you can' t really take a picture with it. If it's cloudy it may be hard to see the sign. It is still really cool to be able to see the sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenwZ6186CG
40,Hollywood Sign,"Best place to see the sign is Hollywood and Highland, and the Hollywood Bowl. There's lots to do at Hollywood and Highland, and also recommend the parking garage for $15.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyhN4304BC
40,Cool sight!,We only saw the sign from afar but it was fun. My kids were excited to see it. We drove up one of the streets to get closer. Beautiful homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ascenethp
50,Loved the view point,"Make sure you travel to the scenic point for the best view ever. Don't settle for a camera shot of the Hollywood sign from the lower streets, travel up the small winding streets for a view you'll never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y2223FZchristopherw
40,Hiking trail,"You can‚Äôt get to the sign anymore, Dont believe the Hollywood movies you CANNOT get to the sign .. we hiked the 6.5 mile (10k) round trip. It was a good work out at its very hilly .. TAKE WATER! To hike up .. Get your Uber driver or taxi to take you to Canyon Blvd park the start of the trail starts there. Enjoy ! And watch out for rattlesnakes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianaj326
50,Yeeee haww,"After 2 bottles of wine I thought it would be a good a idea to book a helicopter ride to see the Hollywood sign.I woke up the next morning and realised that I would actually have to carry out the tour after having paid ¬£140. When I saw the helicopter I took a Valium and relaxed.In all honesty, a helicopter tour of the sign is the best way to see it, you fly from the airport over universal take a left towards the sign where he hovers for about (it felt like an hour) 30 seconds then head over the observatory the Hollywood walk of fame and back to the airport.Best money I have ever spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulp2974
40,Read this for road access info...,"You have to park somewhere on Canyon Lake Dr by Lake Hollywood Park.Road will be packed with cars parked on both sides, so as soon as you see an open space, take it !! You may want to keep driving up the hill and find a closer spot for parking, otherwise will need to return down the hill.You can take the classic pictures from this location or go all the way to the sign probably around 30 minutes hike.There is the park with nice grass where you can have a picnic and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatocanada
50,A dream come true,"You spend your entire life seeing this sign on the movies you watch and then there it is, it doesn't seem real but it is, I guarantee! It's not some hologram.We called an uber and it took us to the top (where you have no cell phone reception) and then the rest you have to walk, but it's really not that far and you get to see the back and the front of the letters if you want!It's really peaceful and great! It was the 2nd stop on our vacations and we really loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaquelCostaLeite
40,40 minute walk to hollywood sign,"We wanted to go and see the Hollywood sign on our trip to LA. We went to the Griffith observatory it is frree parking on the road up to it until 12pm. the only problem is that you are too far away to get any good photos of the sign. We decided to try to get closer by car so I drove to beachwood canyon and Camp Hollywood land. drive as far as you can and there is free parking. It is then a 40 minute walk up hill to the sign. We went on a very hot day you have to be quite fit to walk up there and also take some water. It was worth the hike though, the views of LA and the sign are great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637steh
50,Views from behind the sign,"We hiked what I think is called the Brush Canyon Trail. It was about a 5 mile round trip hike, with a rather wide and smooth trail, but very steep incline in places. Definitely somewhat difficult for someone not in great shape like me. The hike takes you up behind the Hollywood sign, with beautiful views of the surrounding areas. You can‚Äôt get right next to the sign anymore, but the pictures are definitely worth it. I‚Äôm glad I did it once in my life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
40,Hike uphill,Don't waste your time hiking up there u less you have a few hours to kill. The pictures from below come out just as good as way above! We did the 2 mile hike and even though it was fun it's not for everyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624larryg
50,"We got close! But, no cigar!","Our limo tour driver got us close enough for pictures. However, the local residents have now got the street blocked with a manned gate. No one gets through now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjDan48
40,The Hollywood Sign,One of the best places in California. Great walk then went round to the observatory. Advice says it's not easy walking up from the batman caves but it was easy enough even with the heat. Only annoyance was people walking up blaring their own music from their phones. Pretty selfish but still. Loved the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
50,A must see while in LA,"We drove to the Lake Hollywood park, it was super easy to find a parking space (free, hallelujah). Please please please be careful and do not park or stop on red areas to take pictures, police is around everywhere, looking for stupid tourist to give fines! Just park down near the Lake Hollywood park. We then walked about 5-10mn to find a good spot to take pics, it was super nice! We went before midday and the light was great, it wasn‚Äôt too busy. I wasn‚Äôt feeling at my best to try the hike till behind the sign but I‚Äôd have loved too! It‚Äôs a really good and free attraction. So yes it‚Äôs just letters on a hill but it‚Äôs full of history and it‚Äôs also a symbol of LA, so it‚Äôs something to do if you have 1-2hrs ÔÅä",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691aureliem
30,Unplanned side stop,"Easily photographed from the residential street, no reason to maneuver the narrow road to gain closer access to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PartyOf4Vacationers
50,Definitely worth the walk,"I walked to the summit of Mt. Lee with my wife and 14 year old son.. that might not sound much to some, but that‚Äôs the summit at the back of the Hollywood sign, and I‚Äôm a 61 year old who is fat and out of condition. In addition, it was really hot and sunny.This was a major undertaking for me, and the climb was definitely worth the effort as he views are absolutely stunning. The sense of achievement is also immense.We the walked to the Griffiths Observatory. Believe me, if I can do it, almost anybody can.The whole thing is worthwhile, giving a great sense of achievement and also visiting 2 of LA‚Äôs most iconic features.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhQ5357MV

50,Make your trip complete.,A trip to Hollywood Wouldn't be complete without an iconic view and visit to the Hollywood sign. At one point you could drive up and get out of your car and walk. This may not be possible due to neighbor complaints.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryC1841
50,Hollywood!,The best location to view and take picture with the iconic Hollywood sign. There are many visitors and parking is usually tight here. Might need to walk a bit uphill to reach the ideal location to view the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeylow23
50,Great long hike,Make sure you have lots of water and great shoes . It‚Äôs a long hike from Bronson street entrance but sooooooo worth it . It‚Äôs all up hill on way up so be prepared for a good workout . Getting down is easier of course . Helpfull hints their is no portable potties or bathrooms at all. Women bring napkins just in case . Also no water fountains and wear sunscreen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
30,Iconic but a little underwhelming and difficult to get to,Unfortunately the sign is quite complex to traverse to - I recommend asking your driver or driving as if you're going to Griffith park - this will allow you to get the best pictures of the Hollywood sign with less tourists.I would recommend setting off early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JihunKim25
50,So neat!,Loved seeing it and getting a photo & I love how the cross is in the view / photo I got! I wish I could of been closer to it but it was a neat experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kbc1fan
40,"""It's HOLLYWOOD""",Great place to be. Must visit when you are in LA just half and hour drive from the city it depends on the traffic. Click lots of pictures in different spots there. Carry water with u as you have to walk after parking the car. Carry a bottle of water if you want to walk a bit closer towards the HOLLYWOOD sign. it was a beautiful sunny day when we were there. It should be on it checklist just to be there once. We stopped there for an hour on our way to Vegas. And what we all did just click click click. üëçüëçüëçü§üHope this will be helpful for u.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldsourhome
50,Nice neighborhood,You go to a mini park and see the famous sign on top of the hill. And in the way know a very nice neighborhood with really beautiful homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iscdem
50,An iconic hike in LA.,"While you can of course see the Hollywood Sign from many parts of LA, you can only get close to it by foot. This will not be for everyone. But for those who feel like a bit of exercise and a fun half day out, I can highly recommend this walk. And I think the 6.5 mile Canyon Drive Trail is the best way to do it.Park up at the top of Canyon Drive in East Hollywood. Arrive as early as you can to get a parking place. Do the hike in the week if on holiday. Or take an Uber later in the day. Anyway from there is a steady uphill walk to join the Mt Lee Drive. There is not much shade and so I would take plenty of water on a hot day. When you reach Mt Lee Drive it‚Äôs well worth turning left and losing some height for the photo opportunity by the water tower just above the junction with Mulholland.From there retrace your steps and then follow Mt Lea Drive all the way back and on up to the backside of the Sign. From there you get outstanding views of both the Valley and the LA basin. You see the Sign from above and behind which is a unique perspective that you will feel you earnt. Enjoy your snacks and the view before returning downhill to the car. If you have time take the short trail to the Batman Cave. But if not, consider stopping for a drink and some lunch on Franklin opposite the Church of Scientology. Hipster central!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonny8898
40,Bucket list,"Being a big fan of 90210 back in the day, this is of the things my husband has always wanted to see. I‚Äôm glad I was with him when he got to see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laral199
40,Awesome,This is probably the most iconic place in Los Angeles. Actually it's not that hard to get to the hollywood sign. Just find a nearby parking and just go hiking for almost 1 hour and you will get there easily. A must see. The weather is almost perfect there. Best time to go is after 3pm because the sun can get so hot during the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/825bayramt
40,Good experince,Was a great experience to see the Hollywood sign went on a tour which gave us a great explanation of the sign. Well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jelly65
50,Historical Hollywood sign,Historical Hollywood sign . If you take a tour you can get an excellent view . I believe it's just something you view from afar and not up close . The tour guides have a cool story about how the sign came about with the Hollywood land co.,
30,Fun picture,"This was a ""meh"" kind of thing. We felt like we HAD to have a picture with the sign in the background, but we really would have been fine without taking the time to find a good spot for a picture. I feel like you probably should do it if you're only in LA once, but it was a lot of time/effort for a picture.",
30,Excited to go then was really bummed,"It was an average day so I thought why not, let's make the hike. So, the dog and I packed up and off we went. I don't live in LA but visit frequent enough. I have hiked alot of the area and so this being the sign and all was on my list. Parking was easy as there were NO cars about. This was a little different than some of the other hikes. It's very isolated. By that I mean, I was on the trail for about 20 minutes before I ever saw anyone else. There is no water or food of any type at the entrance or any where on the way to top. Load up on water before you head out. Take alot. It's a dirt trail with no shade. The view isn't all that good either until you get to top. I met up with another pair and we actually were from the same area. Small world. The dog loved the walk because there was no other dogs and no other people. As we neared the top, we noticed that there is a large fence around the whole area. You cannot get close to the sign. You can however, keep walking and literally are over the top of it. I was really disappointed as I wanted to get closer but over the top was fine. I was above the smog that day and it was so weird, like a giant cloud over LA. As we decsended, the haze was back. Not a very challenging hike but definitely good workout. It's steep for about 1/4 then definitely up hill but not bad incline. Half way up there is a street but I have no idea what the name is where there were cars parking to walk up as we were passing them on way down. Again, no water or shade just a parking half way point. Not sure I would ever go back. I didn't like the fact there was no one around. I really would have thought it would have been a little more active.",
40,Nice hike,"What they don‚Äôt tell you is that you can drive to the Hollywood sign anymore as it is close community now , and none of the tour busses go there ... but you can take little friendly hike over there . If you don‚Äôt want to pay for Uber or hike all the way you can hop on the bus called Dash from Hollywood Walk of Fame and for 50c it will take you to the planetarium and from there you can go on a walk to see the sign .",
50,Hike,"My boyfriend and I took the hike up to the Hollywood Sign from Beachwood Drive. We arrived 8am-ish so we were able to find parking inside the park. Get there early for parking. The weather was perfect! I mean, the sun was not out at all. Nice cool breeze and a little rain drizzle. The overcast weather allowed me to complete this task. Oh, and try to stretch for 5 minutes or it really does help. I must say that the first mile was pretty hard for me. You are basically going uphill. The second mile was a breeze. Not much hill. I believe the hike is about 4 miles. Two going up and two coming back down. Do wear appreciate walking shoes. I saw one lady wearing sandals and a dress. Believe me, she turned back. Also, bring water. I witnessed a lady who gave up barely into the first mile. So, if you‚Äôre not an active walker like myself take it slow. Stop as needed and proceed as needed. There‚Äôs no rush to the top. Just overcome the first mile and you will be able to get to the finish line üèÅ The infamous Hollywood Sign. Have fun!",
50,Wow,My 12-year-old daughter and I visited in May 2018. First off I would recommend googling how to best see the sign and watch a short video which pops up. It is by far the best thing I reviewed prior to coming to see the sign. My daughter and I made it all the way to the top which took approximately 1 1/2 hours up. I would highly recommend closed toed shoes and comfortable clothing as it is a hike. The area and views are astounding and you really feel the sense of history looking down over Los Angeles. Great highlight. The views from behind the sign are well worth the extra hike.,
40,An Icon Seen From All Over Town,"I never thought to write a review of this since I typically just took the sign for granted whenever going up to LA, just saying ‚Äúoh look, there‚Äôs the sign,‚Äù but it‚Äôs kind of amazing just how some random white letters perched on a mountain could have such presence and charisma no matter where you go in the city. It‚Äôs showed up in a few of my pictures from different places I‚Äôve been to in the area including Griffith Observatory, Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs Hollyhock House (which was made before the sign in fact), and the Hollywood Bowl. What was meant to be purely an advertisement for an upcoming neighborhood has become a world-famous icon and while I feel it can be a little overrated when compared with landmarks like the Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge, Mount Rushmore, etc., it still has a way of complementing and enhancing all of these other places I‚Äôve seen in LA that makes it pretty remarkable nonetheless.",
40,Love the trails,"You can see the ""Hollywood"" sign from a lot of places in LA. I, personally like a hiking that leads you to the top and back of the sign. I hiked this trail a lot of times and it never fails to put a smile on my face when you made it and see LA from the top. It's just beautiful. Highly recommended",
30,Visit during weekdays,"Drive there is beautiful, you get great views of the city. Take your time and stop often. Once you get to the top you have to wait to find parking, then you have to wait to use restroom because there are not enough and everyone seems to need to use one. There are lots of people at all times, avoid weekends. It's one of those must see places that are just so-so but you just have to see it if you're in the area. Parking is cheap but don't plan to spend too much time there, take your pictures and leave...",
50,great for a quick stop to take selfies,don't take a paid tour if you have a rental car just drive to the sign where you can park for free on the road. great place for a quick selfie with the family,
40,Icon but please hike from the observatory!,"This is truly a Los Angeles icon. But you will appreciate it much more if you start the trek at the Griffith Park Observatory. It is a little over a mile but you will see so much more of our city. The views are great on a clear day. And local folks will appreciate your consideration. Make a day of it and see the observatory too! Note that regardless of where you start, you will be unable to get next to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/055LavoniaD
10,Hollywood Sign,Really stupid. Should have been torn down long ago. A ragged remnant of a real estate advertising campaign of the last century.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidthefoodie
30,Not the same now,"We visited the HOLLYWOOD sign back in 2016 and this was our first visit, we were amazed and in awe when we saw it, when you see it on t.v u dnt realise the sheer size of it, its quite difficult to get too, and now it is now closed off to the public due to vandals and graffiti, however there is a residential road near the sign where you can get some good selfies and pictures taken of you and the sign, but please respect the residents who live there as its there home your actually stopping outside of to take pictures, most residents are happy for you too stop for photos but just be mindful it's there space your encroaching on....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanhK4442UP
40,Great to see,Great to see this iconic sign. My girlfriend and I went to view the sign from the observatory which wasn‚Äôt over crowded so we could easily get that picture we wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snakedoctor321983
40,Always around,"Everyone we went in LA the sign was usually in sight. Having never been before it was very cool to see it in person. Great views when going to the observatory, and very close up view from Lake Hollywood Park (got our best photos there).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pedz55
50,Classic must see,"You‚Äôve seen it on TV and you‚Äôve got to see it in real life, you can view the sign from many places in the city but my favorite is near the basin to get closer to the sign, bit hard to find tough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fdg1337
40,Shame you can‚Äôt get closer.,"It‚Äôs such a disappointment to view the sign from the distance only. It‚Äôs true that it is truly captivating to see it for the first time.The best view point is the Griffith Observatory I found, but our open bus tour took us to a good look out point as well.I would‚Äôve lived to see how big the letters were in the flesh but due to a stunt by some actress umpteen years ago who decided to throw herself off the top of the ‚ÄúH‚Äù because her acting career didn‚Äôt take off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sifterboy
30,"Just kind of ""meh""","The hike isn't all the strenuous and the views are great over the city on a clear, sunny day!But the first leg of the hike reeks of horse manure... And you feel like your playing Hop Scotch while dodging all the feca matter spewed across the road.I like to do hikes when I have a headache at times, and the first part just made me nauseated :/ so basically the only downside is all the dung. Everything else is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amstorc
50,Required visit for that selfie,"Ore of an iconic place to be situated around, as i don't think you can actually visit the sign itself. Best place to get a good snap of this is at the Griffith park Observatory, and that way you can kill two birds with one stone.Take your picture, and go enjoy the observatory too.Make sure you have your best duck face on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTwos
40,Hollywood iconic symbol,"I was thinking, you've never been to Hollywood if you didn't see this sign :) Most tours will bring you to Griffith's Observatory to have a good view of this HOLLYWOOD sign and so we did. Apparently, you can continue hiking up the slope to have a better view but we didn't have time and strength for it:) so we settled taking pics from Griffiths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Making_Memories_L
50,Selfie that you were in Hollywood,"First of all it is nice to combine hiking to Griffith observatory when heading to Hollywood sign. That's the way to see both places, the nature and great views. But when you want to have THE selfie you were in Hollywood, the things is to head here. You can see the sign also further away, but it will be so small that it will not be worth taking the selfie. Even the observatory is a bit far for that. The place to take the photo is well underneath the sign, you do not need to go all the way up if you do not want to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomiJ
50,Beautiful hike,"Start your hike at the observatory, you can get an Uber here, it takes about 2 hours to walk up to the back of the sign but you get some awesome views the whole time. Great views of the city, make sure you take a camera and sun screen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skphillipsss
40,Sign,It was cool to see the sign after seeing it in so many movies I‚Äôm glad we saw the usual tourist stuff wasn‚Äôt as dirty or crazy as I thought it would be,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/435janei
30,the Hollywood sign is a well known icon so good for some photo opportunities,"This is just a sign in reality and its not that impressive, and realistically the only the fact its a well recognized icon that makes it something to visit.There are tours there, but seriously I wouldn't waste the money. As thousands do hire a car and simply drive up there park and take whatever photos you desire. That way you can also drive around Beverley Hills Santa Monica pier and surrounds and while in the neighborhood make the trek up to the iconic sign. There are several viewing areas where you can get out and take photos of the sign in the background.There are views over LA from up there and at sunset the views are quite good.You can hike right up to the sign itself but its a very steep hike and unless you find this sign a big deal its probably not worth hiking the couple of kilometers up a very steep winding hikedue to it appearing in so many tv shows and on movies its good to say you have been there but again I would not waste any money on a tour when you can simply drive here on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818JeffT
20,Disappointment,"The parking and walk to where you can see the sign is a lot, also the sign does not light up at night which was news to many tourist. It is only lit if needed for movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6394QMjenniferm
50,Fantastic views from the Hollywood resevoir,After asking people where was the best place to take pictures with the Hollywood sign we put the postcode in our satnav for the Hollywood resevoir and after a good 20 minutes of driving up hill and past many houses we eventually got there. It was fantastic not only was it the best view but we also recognised the bridge from the many films it has been in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debwales
30,Prey for no fog,"I would have loved to have done the hike up the residential hills to be a bit closer to the sign, but due to lack of time, I had to settle with a vantage point just off from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The first day, it was like it was non-existent due to the thick fog that covered the sign (to the point where you question if you are standing in the correct spot and looking in the right direction), but the second was much better. Five minutes and a couple of photos down (take a good lens), you're done!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jemkh
40,Cool,"This place is cool to take pictures. In my opinion, this tourirm point ia mandatory when you go to holywood. I have read many comments on internet about to walk for 3 km to arrive there. My advice: you won‚Äôt need. Because, there are locals to stop car at streets near Holywood Sign. From this place, you will take many good pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrunoAntonioli
30,Nice area. Don‚Äôt plan on getting up right next it,"One and done. It‚Äôs cool to see, but it‚Äôs just a sign. The surrounding homes are beautiful and tightly packed in. I‚Äôm positive that the locals are annoyed with the tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mkdkay
50,The higher you go the better view becomes,"Make sure to arrive early cuz parking is limited. It's also hot due to the reason that hike is under the sun, no trees. It's very beautiful and you can see the whole city. Note: almost in the very end you will see a sign: to the left and to the right. IF you go left > you will see the sign from the face. IF you go right you will be much higher (longer way btw) + you will see the Sign from the back and more city view.I think if you have time go both. If not go to right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/476tungf
50,Must see Landmark.,The quintessential Hollywood landmark. We didn‚Äôt climb it or even get that close but it is so awesome to see. You really can see it from so many parts of the area and to never gets old. Make sure you see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roslyn28wantagh
40,Too far,Go up to Griffith Observatory for a closer look. But it's just a sign. No big deal unless you are into that sort of thing. Or just being in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ned14
40,Classic sight,"It is a classic sight that you should see if you're in the area but at the end of the day it is literally just a sign on a hill. Try to see it during the day, at the night it is hard to see as it is not illuminated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainCookieDaddy

30,Wish it was lit up,We went to Griffith observatory but it was too dark to really enjoy. We did see it from the Boulevard and took some pics with it in the back. I didn't think it was worth driving up the hills to get a closer picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittneyLikeSpears
40,Review of 'close' to the sign,"We drove the beautiful narrow roads to the base with the intention of walking to the sign. However, there is security at the top so you can't park and quite a ways back to parking places. So... had to admire from a far on this one. That said it is kind of cool to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nedelakttraveler
30,Free activity,"We drove as close to this as possible, up some winding roads into the Hollywood hills. Literally parked on the road side and took photos. Didn‚Äôt cost anything and was very straight forward. No frills!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkif900
50,amazing views,"I recommend taking the Wisdom Tree Hike up then continuing across to get to the Hollywood Sign. It's a rocky path, so make sure to bring shoes with good grip for the hike. Workout clothes would be best for the vertical start to the hike which can heat up quick on a warm day (no shade). The parking is free and plentiful at the Wisdom Tree Trailhead as opposed to driving up near the main paved road to the sign (which is overcrowded). Plus it makes the views more rewarding!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryr50

Ignore all the signs that say you can't get to the sign from here....you can.The address is: 3000 Canyon Lake DriveObviously other people have this address as we saw a few tourists up there so just remember people live there and it must be really annoying.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelled163

50,Keep Fit!,"I‚Äôd been wanting to see the Hollywood sign for a good 4 years so when I had the chance to go on holiday to LA I knew I had to see it! On the day we went we decided we were going to get as close as possible to the sign. We got a bus to Beachwood Canyon and walked from there to 3390 Deronda Drive which took 40 mins but had great views on the way up. We decided though to get higher up. We hiked about 20 mins more trying to get behind the sign but realised we‚Äôd taken the wrong route. We were quite tired so decided not to get behind it that day but still had a great view and saw some lizards. I‚Äôd definitely recommend doing this hike, it‚Äôs worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/senorgaryb
50,Iconic,Great views from Mulholland Drive or other streets below the sign. Get great shots but don‚Äôt hike. Hiking gets you too close for pictures and the sign is fenced so you can‚Äôt touch it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markandcathycalgary

30,not impressed,"I was expecting something different, there isn't much up there and they made us park way down so the walk was about 1 hour up the mountain in 90 degree temperatures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4493PJbend
50,American Landmark,As an East Coast guy I must say I am blown away when I say this true American landmark. To me it‚Äôs a symbol of the glitz and film industry that America for better or worse has created. If you are in LA area this is a MUST see sight!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinsGirls
50,Hike is LONGER than you think,"We had read routes of 3.8 miles round trip. Well I don‚Äôt think we found that. We ended up doing about 6+ miles some of it scrambling. We ended up dropping into a neighborhood and taking a Lyft back to where we had parked. On the map we took the route around the water tower. Do NOT recommend that. Stay on the paved / dirt roads. BRING WATER, even on a cool day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnySong

40,Its a sign,"My granddaughter wanted to see the Hollywood sign when we took a trip to Burbank. So, I took her up to the Griffith Planetarium which gives you a good view of the sign. She was happy to see it from there and crossed it off the list of iconic LA places she wanted to see. What can be said about a sign? It is there. It is ioconic. It is in a lot of LA/Hollywood type things. At the end of the day it is just a sign of tall white letters on a hillside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X3523EBbobf

40,Nearest road to hollywood sign,Thanks to trip advisor.. i was able to get to the holyywood up close and personal.. though he road is a little bit tricky.. it pays to walk towards the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gracefulwalk
30,Access fluid,"The Hollywood sign, being an old land development advertisement, was meant to be viewed from a distance, and that‚Äôs probably the better plan of action.There are on-going efforts to balance access , with the reasonable privacy concerns of local residents, and a search can give you the latest, best locations for photo ops.A more interesting exercise in enjoying the large scale and construction of the sign is a fire access, hiking trail that starts at the end of a cul de sac in the Lake Hollywood area. It takes you to the ridge line of the hills that nestle the sign,right behind and slightly above it.An unusual and fascinating angle on thisL.A. landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrentW493
50,Great for locals and tourists alike!,"We recently moved to the LA area, and we‚Äôve been trying to get to know our new city. What better way than doing one of the more touristy things in the area? We took the path from the Beachwood area of town and hiked up from there. It took about an hour to get to the first scenic view and then about another 30 minutes to get to the top of the sign (keep in mind, we‚Äôre not particularly avid hikers, just normal walkers). The views were great and the photo opportunities even better! We only wish the air quality would have cooperated a little more today.As with everything in Los Angeles, parking is an absolute nightmare. We parked about a mile downhill, in the Beachwood residential neighborhood. Just be particularly careful, there are lots of parking restrictions and plenty of parking enforcement officers.Overall, even if it is touristy and cheesy, I still think it is something that everyone should get to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzyMarie23
50,"Iconic Landmark, Great Photo Place","It is a very confusing and twisty road. We came here and spent probably 30 minutes here. Take lots of of selfies, and ask people to take your photo. This place is truly beautiful as well, with a lot of green. Any questions, please ask. This is definitely a priority when coming to LA.Photo Tips:-Try to make sure nobody is taking a picture in your picture-Try holding up the Hollywood sign-Try looking at the Hollywood sign but facing the cameraTry pointing and looking at the Hollywood sign while facing the camera",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatOneTraveler101

40,Must visit when in LA,"Definitely a must visit, but not because it is a breathtaking attraction...just so you can cross it off your bucket list. I imagined there to be a lot more people but it wasn't that bad. However, the ""hike"" up the hills was quite intense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllieW181
30,Sign,"If you are not in shape, dont even both. You have to do alot of walking up the hill. The parking in ridiculous. You can barely get next to the sign for a good picture. Just to knock off your bucket list, you can visit, but not worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninasexy256

40,"Hollywood, here I come",once you arrive to the top the presentation is a bit cheap and it should be taken care as a better presentation although the view is spectacular if you like an ocean of villas. The way to top is not signed but you find very friendly people who can direct you to destination. Better on week days as parking can be really hard. You will have to walk a bit but...what a picture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcoBrevi

30,Difficult to get to,"Difficult to get to for the obligatory tourist photo. The tourist guides give addresses that only take you to neighborhoods with a proximate view of the sign. Do get as close as you can, take the photo and save it for the grandkids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petern834
40,Hollywood Sign Location,We found a great shot of the sign from the caves. Its in a park and not too far of a walk up the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcjlund
50,Hiked the Hollywood sign mountain,"We had a few hours to burn after arriving in town. Once we figured out where to park we took a few trails from the observatory to the mountain peaks and got some great photos of the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles. Some trails were easy dirt roads, others were smaller and more steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phx1sjc
40,Cool,You can't get to the sign legally. There is an overlook you can go to and see it. You go through steep small streets in rich neighborboods to get there. Wouldnt go back but would recommend going to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anichols39
20,It's just a big sign,"Not worth trying to see up close. The residential neighborhoods around it have objected and, I believe, closed off the streets. Find a high-rise building or viewpoint if you want to see it or take a photo, but, frankly, it's just a big sign and not even related to the Hollywood of movie history. Perhaps I'm a jaded local, but a big sign is not the Hollywood tourists want to see. To see the Hollywood of movie history, make it a point to visit a studio such as Universal (Paramount may also have one) and take the ride to view the back lots. There are also bus tours that go through Hollywood and Beverly Hills that may stop at view points where the Hollywood sign is visible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveledfordecades
30,You can't get close to it unless you trespass,It's pretty disappointing that you can't actually get close to it. It's surrounded by rich neighborhoods who have closed off access to the general public. You're left having to go to parks where you can see it from a distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pompberry
40,Cool to see the symbol of Hollywood,We stopped to see THE sign that‚Äôs represented Hollywood since it‚Äôs golden era. It‚Äôs illegal to go near the sign so we viewed it from a lookout point overlooking the city. Very cool to see it ‚Äúin person‚Äù.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/456jeffn

40,A long hike!,"A better view of the sign but warning! It is a solid 3-4 mile hike each direction. A lot of elevation changes too! Bring lots of water and some protein. Also, there are no toilets...that should speak for itself. Otherwise amazing views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roadkillz
40,Okay,"Once your have seen it, you have seen it. We saw it from the observatory. Great hike on a warm evening!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukebrown1991
50,Must do!!!!,If you visiting Cali is an obligation to take a pic on this iconic monument in Los Angeles.Caution the street to the park is close to publicThe only way to get close to there is if you go to horse riding!!But you take good pictures from the bottom of the hill!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseVazquez1975
50,The famous sign,"It was my dream to see that famous sign, which is an iconic place for LA. I finally had the chance to see it last year, with my friends. Having my best friends with me, the hike was really fun even though we had to hike about 5 miles and it was super hot outside. I would love to do that again.PS: there is written on one of the gates that you can find cold water there (in case you are out of water). You just have to follow the sign and you will find there a man who sells cold water for one dollar/some currency from your country. On this way I would like to thank him again. This is so nice of him and it‚Äôs really helpful.If you are an adventurous person go for that hike, you‚Äôll see that is more than just a sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandradR5718XZ
50,Hiked behind the sign - 3 hours total,"Visited LA and decided that I had to hike to the Hollywood sign no matter what. Heard security has ramped up these couple of years and many places forbid you from climbing to the top. There's fencing around the sign and helicopters circulate the area every half hour, plus there are security cameras up there. So nobody can do anything naughty with the sign.Thankfully I found the Hikingguy article online that instructed you how to hike to the fencing behind the sign. Overall it's 6 miles and yes, if you're not a hiker, it's tough. It's a lot of winding around the mountain. Definitely not for the faint of heart. I persisted though, and it was a magnificent sight - seeing the whole of LA down below was super meaningful and memorable. Just remember to get to right behind the sign you need to aim for Mt.Lee's summit. Ignore all the other signs pointing to the ""Hollywood"" sign.If you're into adventures and hiking, definitely try hiking to the Hollywood sign! It's an awesome experience, provided that you don't step on any horse dung (apparently you can ride a horse close to the sign?).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arilailee
50,Hollywood sign,"This was a ""bucket list"" item for me. I've always wanted to see the sign and it finally worked out. Park on Lake Hollywood Drive on the hill, don't go up the road toward the trailhead. Its hard to turn around and you can't park. It took us 30 or so minutes to hike to the Wisdom Tree. That trail is definitely the most rugged part of hiking to the sign. It is a little under a mile to the sign from there. The trail puts you at the top of Mt Lee behind the sign. It was a good hike and so worth it for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreybuerge
10,Its a sign,"I was not impressed by the sign though the history of the sign was inspiring, But its hollywood a little more pain and some better lights would help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lavoniaw2017
40,The Sign,The sign is one of the most see attractions while visiting California. I enjoyed this attraction and walking up to the Griffith Park. It was a neat experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352MD
50,Landmark to see!,"This is a must see landmark if you are in Los Angeles! It is a great view! I love that they have different tours you can take, so that you are able to get closer to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetzec
40,Must see,"i don't really know what to say that has not been said allready, but for me it was a great experience, being there, the sun, the wind, the pictures....Hollywood hills forever :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihaelan2013
50,Must see in Los Angeles,"Beautiful museum, one of its kind in the world, because everything is not contained in one building, there are buildings and you get to go out and enjoy Los Angeles outdoors before entering another building to see its collections. The buildings are made of different materials and shape of squares, make sure you take the architecture tour to learn more. Get the audio set to get more information on the exhibits and collections. All free. Enjoy the more the mono rail from the parking to the center and you will see the beautiful Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyPraise
50,"Nice, Just Nice","One of those places if you go to LA, you must see. Nothing special, there is no structure for tourists like where to buy a water for example. There are a few ways to take the picture, you may need to look in advance for the choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabrielsouz
30,The Sign to See,"The service sign is a must see while in the city, but if you think getting close to it is possible then you are wrong. You may hike close, but there aren‚Äôt any tours that I know of, and trust me I searched to see that takes you to or close to the sign. So, take a tour, pretty much any tour, and they will take you to a location that will get you a good view of the sign and a good photo opportunity. It‚Äôs worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventuresofsonyat
50,A bucket list item,You can access the trails that get you within range of the sign to get a good picture. But you can no longer access the sign up close.My friend and I decided to take a horseback ride up the same trails as hiking to take in the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elizabethrap
40,Long walk for so little...,"We picked this as a random place we wanted to visit during our time in California. We had no idea where we were going or what to expect when we arrived. We didn't have the proper walking shoes or enough water for what was needed. To obtain a good view of the sign, you will need to walk up a steep incline (wear good shoes) and need a lot of water if you plan to hike close enough for a decent photo. Take your time and don't rush, since this could be your exercise for the day. Also, there aren't any restrooms in the area, so be sure you plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2017Queen
20,Famous sign,"The famous sign, but just it. Just a sign with nothing else. I think after long years, They could work more on this place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlfredS1511
40,morning hike-sneakers is just fine,The air is very dry compared to the tropics. Lots of walkers heading the same way and it‚Äôs open to both road and Mtb bicycles. I would choose the Mtb as lots of dirt trails and tracks.You can‚Äôt really trek right to the signage without getting into trouble with the law. You can get within about 500 yards. I got past the cameras before the loud speakers call you out to get lost.Our car is parked right where Google recommend the stop/start of the trails which is about 3 hours trek. It‚Äôs a landmark for sure but maybe overrated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ctan1965
40,See It From Lake Hollywood Park,"Couldn't figure out the best spot to see the sign, so I tried a few. Went to the Griffith Observatory, but the sign was so far off in the distance. i got a tip there saying to go to lake Hollywood Park, and find the vista point. So I did just that, and it's really THE place to view the sign. clear as day, and big for your Instagram pictures lol. Still go to the Observatory to see the entire city, but this is the better view point for the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086
50,THE spot to go get your Hollywood sign picture,we read so many suggestions on where to go to see Hollywood sign best . Its absolutely crazy how many push you to places like the Griffith Observatory which offers stunning views across LA but just a distant crappy view of the sign itselftake it from me .... you want to get over to Lake Hollwood Park off Mulholland Highway and stand at Vista Point . Sign is huge and very visible . Any closer and the houses / hills will block your view,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryecapital
50,It's a must!,"If you're visiting LA, you gotta go see it! Especially if it's your first time in the city! Somehow we managed to get onto a trail that took us behind the sign. Great place for photos, but what a hike! I wasn't prepared for it! Don't ask me where we parked, because I don't have a clue? Haha. Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
40,Huge,The sign is very huge and the scenario is really outstanding with the beauty of nature and is very famous tourist site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirtan777
40,Close... but not That Close....,"Ok..we started at the Griffith Observatory. We took the bus up. The parking is a challenge. We drove around for 15 minutes looking for a spot. It was just luck that we found one. We didn't pay in our spot but others closer were pay to park. We then went back down the hill and turned left There are rest rooms at the Observatory. We went across the street to where the hike begins... you can take your pick as to how 'close' you get. Take water and wear appropriate shoes. We decided to see how far we could go.. then once we got started we said.. we can't stop now..how many times have i said that. Well, we just kept going...slowly up. The hike is easy and the road is paved much of the way. However, take note...the entire hike was over 7 miles up and back. So, It was a trek. You can get somewhat close but not THAT close to the sign... it is private property up there. Of course some folks I saw paid no attention to the sign and kept going up. I was fine stopping at the designated trail end. Looks alot like the picture..haha.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hoosier63
30,Better Viewed from Griffith than up close,The sign symbolizes the giant entertainment business which is hollywood. seen pretty well on the way to Griffith and adequately pictured.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/791manast
30,Hollywood,"Find it best place to get a good photo of the Hollywood sign is from the Griffith observatory, when it's a clear day !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8584PMsamb
40,"Love it or leave it, see gotta see it!","All the other reviews are correct, its only 9 white letters on a mountain, over-rated sure, hard to get to, yes, tons of tourists that are overstimulating, absolutely, however when you're driving and look up and see those famous letters on that mountain, one can't help and put a smile on your face as its the staple of the city of angels, the famous Hollywood sign. We ended up going to the corner of the highwood mall to get a decent picture of the sign, and we were just as pleased. I have heard from locals that getting to Hollywood Lake Park is probably your best bet if you want an up close and good photo, without enduring a hike. I was just as happy driving around the city and seeing that signature sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cro_sandy72
30,Had to be done!!,"OK, so i'm a 'Brit' abroad! I had to do the Hollywood sign photo! We were in Downtown LA and decided to drive up through the streets, and not go up to the very top. It was so busy, but I get why?! If you have to do it, maybe go into LA and stay more in the streets, catch a photo of the street lights, or the roads leading up? We found the experience better from further down into LA rather than under the sign itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RescuedVegan
30,Way overrated place,"If you are willing to have one picture in front of the sign you should go, if you are uninterested better go other place to visit. Is parking only on the street and you have to enter the park for a better view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariusg1981
30,You can't go to the sign.,"The Hollywood Sign was a temporary sign that ended up staying. The problem is that you can't get close to it. Every picture in front of it is either a long lens zoomed in, or in front of a fake backdrop on Hollywood Blvd somewhere. The best place to view the sign is the Hollywood Dog Park. there is some parking, and you can sit in the sun and have a picnic under (ish) the sign. If you try to get close through a neighborhood, the homeowners won't like it. All the roads near by are dead ends with signs that say ""No Access to the Hollywood Sign""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leiasnerfherder
40,Would not want to live in this area!,Too many tourist driving locals crazy... I am sure...be nice be ...respectful of the locals... park only were permissible asIn legal. Not sure what the big deal is just a bunch of white letters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleshK2416MN
30,View of the sign,"The sign is miles away. Limited parking, have to queue to get into parking . I think there are better places to get a photo of the sign. Very disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975darlenew
30,Visit / Travel,Its a far place and looks like you‚Äôre doing a hiking just to have a closer picture to the Hollywood sign.. though you are passing to the most beautiful houses near bye to go the hills or mountain.. but its hard to get the parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyliramzurc
50,What to say,One of the most famous signs in the world. It overlooks the city and is always a good view from different parts of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacopor646

50,It's a hike!,"This was my first time ""visiting"" the Hollywood sign. I didn't realize it was a 5 mile (roundtrip) hike! I'm sure there is a way to drive up, at least part of the way, but my cousin failed to tell me this. When she showed up in running gear, I knew something was up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hooamihere
40,Best view,"The best view is from the observatory at the top of Griffith Park, you can get some really good photos from here as there i no actual path to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillyKent
40,Hollywood ion,Was amazing to be standing and having photos taken when this is what you have seen in all the Hollywood movies. It was a small highlight of our tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenA2853
50,A must,"We went on a tour and one of the first stops was the Hollywood sign from the Griffiths Observatory by the James Dean statue. We learnt all about the sign and history from the excellent tour guide John in LA tours , the office is in Hollywood boulevard walk of fame opposite the mall. Definitely recommend this tourIt's a rather so real to see it and glad it is still there. You can hike up Runyon canyon which I have done as well just take plenty of water but be aware no toilets on the hike",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomad5522
40,Cool,The hike to the Hollywood sign was long (our route was approximately 5km one way) but easy walking. The scenery was nice (rolling Hollywood hills and a view of the city) and quiet. Weather was hot and dry. Was neat to see the sign up close and get some pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canadiana25
50,Fun to hike!,"Once you make it to the entrance, that is were the journey begins. Right off the bat you can get some great photos, but definitely venture off and hike as far as you can go to get closer to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alucard827
50,The Hollywood sign with an incredible view!,"We hiked up behind the sign and was afforded a great view. The hike is manageable but it is a bit of a leg and butt workout and can make you catch your breath. Make sure you take water at any time of year and wear a hat; these will help you stay cool. Summer would be very hot, so go early in the morning or later in the day. You get great views of the front of the signnas well as LA and Burbank, can see the ocean and Palos Verde on a clear dayüòä",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherryL1334
50,SO worth the effort!!,"This was our 6th trip to LA and Hollywood, so we‚Äôve seen the sign a few times but never from above and and behind it!!WOW!! It was SO worth it!!We researched the hike with the help of ‚ÄúHiking Guy‚Äù but it would have been pretty straightforward, following the signs.At a gentle pace it wasn‚Äôt too much exertion, though I have to admit I needed a couple of stops, on the final stretch!But, turn the last corner and you‚Äôre there: right behind those huge 40 foot letters, which make the most iconic sign in the world!Just a few feet further and you‚Äôre actually above it, catching your breath and soaking up a panoramic view of the journey you‚Äôve just made with this amazing city and the ocean as a backdrop. Look behind you and there‚Äôs the San Fernando valley and mountains beyond!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Westwick
50,A must see,"Although I think it isn‚Äôt legal, to go all the way to it; a couple of my friends have hiked there, to touch every letter, but one!",
40,A must see,Managed to see a number of houses belonging to the celebrities. The Hollywood sign is the highlight of the tour.,
50,Pretty cool history,Finally got to see it this time. Took pictures from a couple of different locations. Would highly recommend taking a tour.,
50,Love the sign,Such an iconic part of LA. Must see ! I will say if you want to see up close it‚Äôs quite a hike! We will definitely come back next time,
40,Must see,It was a beautiful day my family and I walked to see the sign. Hollywood BLVD was not what I expected but the sign did not disappoint.,
30,SO much fuss about not much,"It's definitely cool to see the sign, but honestly you can see it from a lot different parts of the city. So driving there just to see the sign is not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lara_McEwan
30,Iconic but you won't get too close.,Difficult to get too close to this one and if your on a tour your photo shoot will be a long way away. The sign alters in perspective during the day due to light angles etc. Clearly iconic but access ALMOST impossible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portfolioman
40,A must do in LA,"Well this is an icon, a tourist magnet even if you can only see it in the distance, and you get griffith park and the onservatory all n the one stop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antinmelb
40,"Great views, but","Parking in the area is very bad. It‚Äôs residential parking, it‚Äôs bad, the residents don‚Äôt want you there. You hike about a mile is my guess. You can see the Los Angeles area on one side and the valley on the other",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvillamil
50,Excitement,Our older generation grew up seeing this icon on so many shows and advertisements. It was exciting to drive up the mountain to photograph the sign. The view is amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob19512014
50,Fun ride,Great place to take a horseback ride and then go over the hill to the Mexican restaurant the view is spectacular when there is no smog,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andamy18
20,this is very stupid and boring.,"I thought it would be some sort of a sight, something that will move me after seeing it on t.v.this is very boring , simple sign, you see from far (and I got relatively close to it), I really don't get it. I went there cause it's like a must in LA but after going there I have to say - spare the time, do something better and just take a picture from far or from the hollywood blvd which I understand as a mall with a view to the sign.don't bother getting closer to it, waste of time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Offy_b
40,Good Day outing to click some Pictures,"There are couple of spots from where you can get a very good view of the Hollywood Sign.The one at Ledgewood Drive and the other one from Griffith Observatory. The Ledgewood drive spot is the best one of the lot and you get a near perfect picture of the Hollywood sign. As an added bonus, there are good views of the Los Angeles River as well.Good Street Parking options are available and its a good spot for a 15 minute stop.Overall - good fun outing . !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chasedreamz
50,A sight to behold,This is an obvious must see for all visitors. It gives even more of an impact when seen in person. The best view we found was from the Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillieh498
50,Maybe not what you expect,"It is one of the world recognized sing in the world, but it is hard to find a parking near the sign. Maybe better to come by uber or taxi and walk. It is actually quite far from the road, you need really walk to come very close. But very poplar place to take picture or selfie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talgatd
50,Iconic sight,Hollywood bus tour stopped in perfect places to get great photos. It is possible to walk reasonably close but barriers around for national security,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorkshireGrandma
40,Nice views and cool surroundings!,"A walk uphill for about 30-40 minutes, where there's a foodstore right in the beginning of the walk. You can get there by bus. When you're up you can walk to the griffith observatory as well. You get really nice views of Hollywood and L.A when you're up there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillafrokenj
40,Take the Photo from Griffith Park,"We went to the observatory and used a telephoto lens to capture a picture of us with the sign. It's much better, you don't have to walk all the way to the sign and you get a very good view of the sign from the park/observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slab
40,Close to Hollywood Sign,Beachwood Canyon is as close as you can get to the iconic sign which is visible from many places in LA. It close enough for a good selfie. We drove up and got parking on the first Saturday in November. If you ignore the trespassing signs you could get closer. In our other trips to LA we only saw it from afar. The original sign was put up to advertise a property development.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Sunset Hollywood Ranch is the best way to see the sign,Riding horses in the Hollywood Hills with the city and ocean as your backdrop nothing compares. Great views and pictures while on horseback!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2659HXsarahb
50,Why wouldn‚Äôt you?,"This is one of the most iconic signs in the USA, so why wouldn‚Äôt you take the time to see it? Yes, the traffic is going to be bad, but that‚Äôs part of the LA experience. We just made it an adventure and didn‚Äôt let it stress us.There is more to see than just the sign if you head up to the observatory. You have beautiful views of the mountains and surrounding area as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RNRVTraveler

30,Way too difficult,"The best way to see the sign and to take pictures is putting this address in your GPS: Los Angeles, CA 90068 (Central L.A)If you're lucky, you will find parking, it's a pain, because you can't stop, not even a second to take a pic from the car.When we almost given up, we found parking and were able to take a couple pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warap2018
10,Why would you bother???,"We saw the sign from the Griffith Observatory. Yes, it is big letters stuck on a hill. Nothing more, nothing less. Why would you go out of your way just to see this???",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinker901
50,Lake Hollywood Park,We used map it to find the Hollywood sign. But when we got to the top it was an observatory. The man there told us to go to Lake Hollywood Park. Wow! he was right! AWESOME View. so just put in your map it the park I mentioned. that will take you right there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angeladrain

30,Driving L.A.,"It was very confusing, even with GPS to find great views of the Hollywood sign, however it is iconic and was fun to see.",
50,Hollywood sign,it good walk through all the houes to see the hollywood sign and you get to see this through griffith observatory well,
40,Must see,We drive to the hills in a residential neighborhood to see the Hollywood Sign. It was great to see along with looking at the houses down below. The weather was great and the view was awsome.,
40,Hollywood sign best viewed from the observatory,Went to the Griffith observatory about 10AM before the crowds. The observatory doesn't open until noon. Lots of school buses with kids; but uncrowded. The bathrooms in the parking lot were clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neelee
40,A Star is Born,It‚Äôs a very windy road up to the observation parking area....the sign is a must see for it‚Äôs nostalgic value. Parking was along the road and next to a park... careful when parking because it‚Äôs on a very steep hill and remember to turn your wheels. We had to walk instead of parking on the hill because our rental didn‚Äôt have much power to keep from rolling in the parking space. The park is nice and there were many people there taking pictures. There are trails to hike but for a quick picture and photo op...this is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoonChild5280
40,Iconic But It's A Sign People Let's Keep It In Perspective. Warning Naughty Review And Go On A Weekday.,"There are myriad reviews of best places to take a picture of the sign, but lets face it the best picture is the one with your loved ones front and center with the sign in the background as it's people that make places. So let's go one step beyond. You need a permit to ""go to the Hollywood sign"" and if you get caught you may get in trouble but how do you get to the Hollywood sign. First thing if you've very young or very old travellers forget this. For others for whom the naughty gene shines brightly, wear hiking clothes, and off we go. North on Beachwood Drive from Franklin Avenue, go left on Ledgewood drive and then a right onto Rockcliff drive. Go to nearly the end of Rockcliff and turn left on Deronda Drive, ignore all signs as the no parking doesn't apply on a weekday and park on Deronda where parking is allowed. Walk up Deronda, pass under the white arch and you'll figure out your next move. Walk up the paved road Mt.Lee Drive and you will find yourself behind the Hollywood sign. It is said that one could shimmy down and sit on the sign and get a very cool picture. I can only tell you what is said, and that the pictures turned out great :-) Be careful and have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB

10,The Most Over Rated Landmark in the World,I simply cannot understand why people stand in the middle of the street to get a selfie with this sign. The sign is so far away and looks so small and there is no way to get much closer. Wasted time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/864gabrielv
40,Hollywood Sign,Park in the garage at Hollywood and Highland get your ticket validated at one of the shops or restaurants. Go to the 2nd level of the Hollywood and Highland Center above the Starbucks to take a picture of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grissmg
30,Famous sign that needs maintenance,"Most visitors who come to Los Angeles would like to see the sign. I visited it approximately 20 years ago and would like to bring my kids to see it. However, it appeared to be a bit old and broken from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCMMZhang
30,ok. it's an icon. but it is small and needs painting. Take a picture of it and check it off your bucket list.,"We viewed the sign from the Chinese theater. It's a good was to check off two things at once. They did not let us into the theater. They were showing a star wars movie. The mall is ok. Be sure to hit the bathrooms while you are here and this is the place to load up on cheap souvenirs. Outside the theater that is, on the walk of stars-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CONSTANCEB832
30,Icon worth seeing once!,There is really no great place to be able to park and the roads around it are very crowded with no direction on where to really go. It was worth it to check it off our bucket list but wouldn't do this more than once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeredithM967
50,Family vacation,We took one of the many drives offers from downtown. Four hour tour of Hollywood homes and township.It was okay but You might say we got a day in the clouds so couldn‚Äôt see the sign and most home you just saw the fences or yards . Guess that‚Äôs all you get . But on way home two days later saw the Hollywood sign from the freeway kids loved that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
40,Such an icon!,"Read directions on how to get to best viewing area and got totally lost. We ended up at the end of a culdesac with a fabulous view. when the signs say no parking, heed the warning! We parked in one such area and walked a couple of blocks leaving someone at the car . We barely got to the area to take photos and got a phone call that parking enforcement was at car and would ticket or tow if not moved in a few minutes. We rushed back and left. I think I would do the hike next time from a designated spot.Kids loved it because they have seen the sign on TV so many times. All it took was 30 minutes out of our day. Fun",
50,Worth the hike!,Do some googling and find the route to walk up behind the sign. Great view and interesting walk up. It's not easy to find and you'll have to leave the car in a residential area so only go during the week as it's restricted at weekends. Alternately get an uber to drop you as close as possible. There is nothing up there apart from the sign so bring your own water bottles and food. It won't take too long to walk up if you're relatively fit.,
50,Hollywood signage,Nice view when you drive closer to the sign. The best view is from a street with residences. the residents do not mind if you stop and take snaps.,
40,"Super easy ""hike""","This is a must if you are visiting Los Angeles. It is probably the easiest ""hike"" you will ever do. Problem would be finding parking, make sure you read all the signs and don't block anyone's home drive-way! Great views of Hollywood!",
40,Over rated,"It's just a sign on a Hill...but it was something we ticked off our bucket list, we did a tour which included famous people's homes, but didn't get to see anyone.",
20,It is a trail up to a bunch of wood letters!!!!,"Okay it is a sign, nothing more nothing less. Yes it has been in a ton of movies. But so has stop, speed limit, don‚Äôt feed the animals signs etc.... Yes it has history, some dream have been made and many more destroyed by those letters ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù. But it is still just a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Powderburner
30,Hollywood Sign,"We went to the observatory to see the Hollywood sign, it was just like we have seen it on television, was a little too far away for good photos, probably the hiking tour you would get a better idea of its actual size.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rena1970
40,Seen through the window of a helicopter ride.,Don't bother with the walk or hike or anything else. Take a helicopter ride to see this amazing hollywood icon! It is amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamoriac
50,Great hike!,"Great elevation hike, roundtrip took 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Bring water, use the restroom before you start as there is nothing along the way. Worth the time to hike behind the sign and you have great views of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/320SusanC320
40,Tick,Very busy Saturday in getting to the location that is closest to the Hollywood sign - great weather and we got some excellent photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hynet9
50,Quintessential California Selfie,Lots of great websites to tell you where to get the pefect selfie (be respectful of private property and parking) but so glad we did it. I don't care how old or young you are it is cool having this picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/385krisj
50,Wow,I thought this would be a bit boring and we only went as my daughter wanted to see it - but I have to say it was well worth the visit - not sure why it has such a pull but the iconic sign has an atmosphere of its own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sazinsoto
40,Where it all began!,This place was magical to see and our drive through the neighbourhood to Beverly Hill was quite breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CiruMwaniki
40,Colf,Went to see it as close as we could. Had a better time seeing the houses up the mountain (when you live in Florida a hill is a mountain lol),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geezette1
40,Nice Hike,"We parked at the conservatory and hiked as close as you could to the Hollywood sign. It was a nice, easy hike. We hike a lot and it was easy to us. Bring water and good shoes. I'm sure in the hot months it would be a very HOT hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thurbers
40,A good Hike and Views - The Backside!,A drive down Hollywood Blvd and then over to and up Canyon Drive. Skip the first parking lot and go to the last one before the gate - it can save you some steps if a spot is open. Use the bathroom before you go...no facilities here!Start walking up the trail - and I do mean up! This route will take you to the Microwave tower on top of the Mountain and you will be able to see the backside of the Hollywood sign!Just keep going up on the main trail - there are marked signposts giving you directions.After you have climbed a while - 40 minutes - you will come to a paved T intersection. Go right - you actually will be going away from the sign at this point but the trails goes up and around. Just keep hiking. Another 25 minutes or so and you will come up to the microwave tower. Go toward the left of the fenced in area and then go up a short steep hill and you will come out on an overlook area with a few benches thrown in. Down below you will be the backside of the Hollywood sign - and just about all of LA - we went on a Wednesday afternoon and not many people around but always like 5 to 10 people there coming and going. Great view of the city - of course you are looking West and the sun can be a hindrance for photos. Either go early in the morning or go later in the day lie 4pm or so.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jccgtown
40,Iconic,Well worth getting up to the National Park area to get a picture with this iconic sign - you won‚Äôt regret it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelozzy
20,It's a big sign,"Nothing more, nothing less. Good for a photo opportunity to show you were there. Nice views over Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/312bels
50,Hollywood Sign Hike ! Fantastic,"The hike starts at Getty Centre. Try avoid going over the weekend as we discovered it was hectically busy. We decided to do an afternoon hike, in hind sight we should have done it in the morning while we still fresh. The afternoon sunset and views made up for the long hike. It‚Äôs about 4 miles up and 4 miles down. Was hard for the smaller kids but they all made it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NattiD
50,Watch yourself on the curves! Go during the week less traffic! Great mountain adventure!,Okay everyone who lives or is visiting LA has to get a picture of the Hollywood sign!! It is a adventure to get there for sure. You know when you arrive after driving through tight turns in the Hollywood Hills and looking at all the celebrities houses. The crowd gets thick when you get there and parking is tight. There are multiple places to get a great picture past all the traffic. Many people get out and walk along the cliffs. We were lucky that my wife has a great steady camera shot. We didn‚Äôt have to stop got a great picture while cruising by!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
50,Great hike to the top.,Great hike from the BAT Cave at the bottom. Full hike is 8 miles and the view just gets better and better as you get higher.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Celling
30,Nice views,It‚Äôs just a sign but it‚Äôs iconic and there are great views from up there. Worth visiting when in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveller77722
50,Have always wanted to see this!,"When we planned our trip to L.A., the Hollywood sign was the one thing that I wanted to be sure I saw. We took a few tours where we were able to see it from various distances, and we got some great photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941adriennes
40,Nice walk/Hike with the family,"My husband, 8 year old son and 2 small dogs had a nice walk near the Hollywood sign. We were able to get some great photos and it was a nice physical activity that we could do as a family for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Babycakesk
40,Nothing special,"The access to the sign is nicely done, but you actually need to walk for too long if you want to see it nicely. If you are short with time you can spend in Los Angeles, it is not a big deal if you don`t see this sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lekler
40,nice hike,the Sign itself is not really worth but the hike to get there is a nice walk outside of the chaos of LA. beware where you park the car - we got a fine :(,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galassoe
40,"Iconic Sign, But Still Just A Sign","You must see the ""Hollywood Sign"" while in LA. I didn't walk up to the top of the mountain to see it. I could see it just fine from several spots from several different locations, while on the streets below, although it did look smaller than hiking up the mountain. It is a famous icon, but it's still just a sign (& you can always buy a post card).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeH-LI_NY-ExPat
50,Hollywood Sign Up Close,"If you want to see Hollywood Sign up close, you must go to Beachwood Canyon in Los Angeles. It is the closest you can see the sign.Since there are so many tourist found out this secret spot, city has stopped cars from parking on top of the canyon, though you can still find certain little streets allow you to park on, your best bet is to park at the bottom of the canyon, and hike up, or uber it up if you don't want hike a long way up. It is worth it! The houses along the streets up to top are beautiful.Once you get to the top, you come to a closed gate, but you can enter from the side, stay to the left, walk around the metal stopping point to get up the hill. Not only you can see the sign, you may just see some beautiful wild peacocks :)Don't forget to stop at the Beachwood Canyon Cafe for a classic hollywood brunch before your hike. Old school coolness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheenaGao
30,It's a BIG sign,I don't think I would bother parking up & walking up to the Hollywood sign. We did however find it whilst out driving - great views from a suburban street - no need to go climbing in the heat!!It's an iconic sign - other that the I don't think I'd bother...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
40,Very Cool !,Seeing if in TV forever finally get to see it from the Griffith Observatory area ! Beautiful day when we were there ! A must see if in the area !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352bobs
40,Good spot to photo taking,You can drive your way up the hill and find yourself a good spot to take some photos. You might find it difficult to park your car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscoe348
50,Uber and hike,Best way is to Uber then hike. May want to bring a hiking stick if you need the extra balance. Also yes there are snakes around rocks so don‚Äôt be dumb. Each letter is at least 20 ft tall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanawan
40,Quick stop for a photo op!,"We didn‚Äôt really have much time to spend, but if you do, I would search for a good hike around the Griffith Observatory. We found a great view and spot for a photo op with the sign! We just made a quick stop and parked in a neighborhood near the Lake Hollywood Park. We hopped out, took a pic, and then we were on our way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Choolwhip
50,Hard work but breathtaking,As a film fan I simply had to trek up to the sign. Parked at the observatory and walked up. This was pretty intense in the summer heat so make sure you take bottled water with you. It took a couple of hours to get up there but the views are breathtaking. Well worth spending a few hours to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealChrisGoodall
40,Trek to the sign,We found free parking on Hollywood lake Dr. We walked for approximately an hour up a dirt track to the sign hard going in some places but a good walk.I suggest you take water and some sun block we went in the mid 80s and it was fantastic. On route we met may others coming back from the sign. The track is clearly marked and you can't go wrong.This route is no good for people who have disabilities or use walking implements of which they require. There is a road way up from another route however I didn't use that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/actnow1200
30,Landmark,"This is truly a landmark that everyone wanted to have a photo, but vehicles are restricted to the area were the sign is located, and there is no parking for vehicles, you should have a driver and drop you off to a certain location and pick you up after the photo shoot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/944JoeyT
40,Manage your expectations and you will be rewarded,"I am writing about the hike that allows several views of Hollywood sign. There is nothing more exciting to the senses than a fine moderate hike through the woods on a early and bright Los Angeles morning. On way, you can see the iconic Hollywood sign up close. You will realize soon its much much larger than you imagined and secondly, you can only get this close to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NitinSS
40,Crowded Hollywood,"Was so exited to be able to see the famous Hollywood sign. We tried to take a picture from Griffith Park, the Observatory, and another random hill that we found on Google.But there were so so so many people in all the picture spots. Lining up to the observatory took nearly an hour!Of course, the sign is a must see tourist attraction, but try not to go during peak holiday season!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellstravs
50,"Yeah, you gotta do it!","I know, I know, how much more touristy could you get, right? But it really is the thing to do. Hiking up to the sign is great exercise and provides a great view of L.A. Seeing it from the Griffith Observatory is just mandatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPeery
50,When in hollywood,How can you not see the Hollywood sign when going to la it's a must plenty of places for a photo opportunity,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul67utb
30,Not a must walk,"Need not walk up to get this pic. can always drive pass, take the picture. Still pretty far away from the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasTravelFun
30,Picturesque,Lots of views. Planetarium I'm sure is worth a visit but we got there early in the morning. Many photo opportunities but bring a telescopic lens for the Hollywood sign if you want to take pictures from near the planetarium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912eves
40,Nice experience,"Nice experience we took a car tour which drove us to all places, showed us houses of Hollywood celebrities / Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaheenaP3
50,The one and only!,"There is a beautiful hike up to a small Rocky plain that not only gives you close up of the infamous Hollywood sign, but an amazing view of the city. (at least a nice chunk of it) I call that a win-win!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/138austinr
40,View from Hollywood Walk of Fame,"Good view from the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Saves you the trip. Bring a good camera if you want a good pic. Otherwise, iPhone does the job",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BecBelle
50,Bucket list,We got to hike up to sign and it was pretty amazing to be in a very iconic place. It was worth the hike in the burning heat,
50,So nice,We went to the lookout and it‚Äôs nice.Still pretty far away from the sign but I‚Äôm sure if you like you can get closer.,
40,It‚Äôs a MUST!,"It‚Äôs a must to visit the Hollywood sign and take a couple of photos here. You‚Äôre not in Hollywood if you don‚Äôt have pictures here. We took Uber from Dolby Theatre, it‚Äôs about 15 mins away. However, pls take note that there‚Äôs no signal on your phone once you‚Äôre up there. We happily taking pictures but we couldn‚Äôt call for Uber to send us back to our hotel @ Roosevelt Hollywood Blv. So both mother and daughter have to walk all the way down the hill until the main road",
40,Positive Outlook,Must see when in LA. Best place to see the sign is to park on Canyon Lake Drive near the reservoir and then walk up Mulholland Highway.,
30,Disappointed,"Because of some silliness, you can no longer hike up to the sign. Also, this icon is no longer lit at night. But it‚Äôs still a Hollywood landmark and a sight to see at least once.",
40,Nice Hike,The hike gives you a better view of the city than the sign but it is still worth the trek up there! On a clear day you can see all the way to Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545clayr
40,Mulholland Drive,"I was a little disappointed and should have done better research. I thought that was a great view from Mulholland Drive and I guess there is but I was expecting to much much closer to the sign from Mulholland Drive. It is quite far away , no like really far way and the sign is TINY in your picture. Like can you even find it in this picture ?!?! No, not really .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaster83
30,Because you should,A big sign that says HOLLYWOOD on the side of a mountain. Nothing special and decent view of greater LA. You go there because you tick it off your list when in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike-5774
30,Must See when you visit LA,The best way to see the sign is to hike up and get as close as you can. Tour buses are restricted now on getting close to the sign. The story is interesting on how it all came about and the fact that each letter is about 40ft tall is pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raymA3333XU
50,Overrrated dign but iconic still,A must do photo shot of the sign even from as far as the lobby of the Dolby theatre. Nothing to fuss but definitely a postcard moment to send picture back home.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bennylimlee
30,WHAT YOU'D EXPECT,"Basically, it's a big sign on a hillside. But you really have to see it because it's so iconic, and if you go with a good guide you'll get it's history and a bit more besides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cascaispickles
40,My poor husband!,"My poor husband pulled over while my teen daughter and I stood in middle of road to get good photos (not best plan) when a lady pulled up and gave me a map which got us out best shots! We went up to Mulholland Drive and then up onto Lake Drive (narrow and windey). You wind your way up through the wealthy houses and eventually come to a great viewing spot and limited parking. Teen daughter was stoked, husband a little stressed (wrong side of car and road, only second day drivingüò≥). Worth it in the end!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOA09
30,Great To See It But Not A Lot Else To Do,"Look, it's Hollywood. You simply have to get a cab up to the famous sign. It's the obligatory photo isn't it after all?To be fair the views are pretty good from up there, the hills rolling off one after another into the middle distance.We really enjoyed our visit. There's nothing much to do except enjoy the novelty of being where you are, seeing the massive white letters up close and enjoying that view...but I'd recommend it if you have an hour to spare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin
50,Iconic place,For me this is so iconic place that it was a must-see attraction! I made some research before visiting the place. There is hard to get there by car - there is nowhere to park up there. I recommend to park your vehicle at N Beachwood Dr and climb up the hill by yourself. It is like 30 mins. of walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xpart04
50,A fun experience even for locals,"There are many things to do in the area of the Hollywood sign. It can be seen from many viewpoints throughout the surrounding area. One of the best locations besides hiking Griffith Park is to view it from Lake Hollywood. At Lake Hollywood, you'll have the opportunity to sit and relax at a lovely park with beautiful breathtaking views of the the Hollywood Hills East side and the lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherishedT
50,Great walk,"If you want a little exercise, take this walk up to the Hollywood sign. It was the perfect thing to make me feel like I was getting a good heart rate increase and some views of the LA area that are breathtaking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceejay1one
40,Nice walk to the sign,Took my nieces and nephews up to the sign. It‚Äôs a nice walk and a pretty cool view when you get up there. Nice to see it once.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/521zakb
30,You won't be close but its a great workout!,"So one thing everyone wants to do is get to this sign, but unfortunately, the path doesn't get you that close its close enough to take pictures and it appears to look close but it's not, none the less the people you meet while going up is great and it's a great workout! My favorite part is leading up to the gates that you enter, if you look down on the sidewalk theres all these amazing messages writen into the concrete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martysandiego24
40,Great photo op and a classic landmark!,"Other than the Star Walk of Fame around Hollywood Blvd., this famous landmark is something for those with ""dreams of Hollywood"" to include in their scrapbook on their photo holiday card. There are many ways to get a good photo, and at the risk of being murdered by my friends who live close to the sign, my best suggestion is to PLEASE take a bus tour if you are from out of town or don't have a car.Depending on the time of year, afternoon gives you the best sun. If you have a car, several of the CANYON streets will get you close enough for a good shot, but it's also easy to get lost on narrow winding roads.There is no legal way to walk to the Hollywood sign itself, just pick a nice day and explore the neighborhoods or, as suggested, take a bus tour that includes the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendor818
40,Something to see,"Glad I got to see the sign and take pics, as it had been on my bucket list. Something everyone should do. We just drove up to the canyon part and had a great view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackiJo
50,Must Visit if in LA,"This is a place known to each and every person in the world. If you were in LA and haven't been to the Hollywood sign, then shame on you. Haha. Beautiful view from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenDunk
40,Hike behind the Hollywood Sign - Go early!,"My partner and I didn't start the hike until about 7:30/8am (in early September), and it was already too late to begin. So my biggest recommendation is to start out early, and to take a lot of water with you, wear a hat and wear sunscreen. We were stopping and seeking shade wherever we could (behind small bushes and tree branches) but it is very exposed and we ran out of water very early on. It's also a lot tougher than any of the articles/reviews that I read indicated ‚Äì a great incline and lots of large lunging steps both up and down! Of course this could have been heightened in difficulty mainly due to the heat, but this didn't stop people of all ages ‚Äì there was an older family with young adults and also students getting in their workout for the day. We went via the wisdom tree, which, on Pinterest, looked very majestic, but sadly when we were there, it seemed to be a place where the homeless had been; it had the aroma of urine and there was graffiti everywhere, which was a great shame. Regardless of this, the views on the way up are amazing and you really do feel like you're on top of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969suziea
10,Terrible,Even tough it was something I grew up with all the hollywood movies and was used to seeing the sign. I felt this was SUCH a wasted trip. The sign is hugely over rated and there is actually nothing fancy or worth seeing about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syeda409
50,Hiking for days,"A must do experience. Taking the path that goes above the sign gives great views of Los Angeles but you cannot see the sign from here just a few of the letters but from underneith the sign you also get great photos. I hiked to the sign by myself, it's steady incline all the way up but definitely worth it even though it takes a few hours. Remember plenty of water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesuitcaserdiaries
10,Don‚Äôt go at night!,"You can‚Äôt see the sign at night, much to our dismay, after fighting for parking and through tons of pedestrians traffic.Be prepared to walk a distance to see sign from Observatory and wait for parking.Awful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ctyce
30,"Hard to get to, unimpressive",We drove and drove and finally arrived after dark to the view point. I was very disappointed. It was not lit. Bummer. If you have Garmen and want to see it take the view B not A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manazefa
40,Just a sign,"It's something you must see during your visit to Los Angeles, but it is nothing more than a simple sign. You can see it from different places in the city, so it's not worth it to go up to the mountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NicoletaJamesSaar
50,Can't Miss It,Larger than life - this is LA! There are so many wonderfuk spots to view it from and it is different from each vantage point. We drove up closerin the hills and it was breathtaking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14judiths

40,"Seen, from a distance","We had booked a city tour and hoped that at some point we'd be able to see the iconic Hollywood sign. Due to the good weather and great visibility, we spotted it on several occasions. It's one of the things that my wife was determined to see on our trip to L.A. Mission accomplished!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandylindsay
30,Sad it is not lit at night,We made it up to Griffith Observatory to look at the sign but only made it up around sunset and so the view of the sign was poor. We were disappointed to not see it lit up but apparently it isn't any more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598jessicao
50,must see,"this is something you should see once in your life. its curuous to imagine sometime ago the word on the hills was longer and looked like ""Hollywoodland"" but then they cut it due to some practical issues. It really blows mind when you see something you are accustomed to see in movies. And now - you are there. Dont try to climb there, it may be dangerous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xelena_boston
40,Small,I thought you could see this from everywhere! It's cool to see but really Small! Lots of view points so need to book a tour or anything,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timtamalam
40,Good view from Lake Hollywood Park,"If you want a clear picture of you with Hollywood sign, you will need to go to Lake Hollywood park. It is right up the hill and you generally should get a parking next to park. Park is pretty small with a small kids play area and you get views of the sign all around and you need to hike like .2 miles from the start of park to reach nearest to the sign. You need to do parallel parking along a slope, which might be tough if you are not good at same. But I found parking at the lane after the park parking ends. There is nothing much else you can do in the park. Taking photos should not take you more than 30 minutes. If you have small kids probably spend 30 mins in the kids",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/547kaustubhm
40,Iconic View,Stopped off a small viewing point on one of our tours to get photos of the sign. We were quite far away from it. But still good to see as it is such an Icon. Like seeing the empire state building while in NYC. just one of those things you have to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster

40,Worth Checking Out,It is really cool to see something that is so iconic of America. We were able to check out the Hollywood sign from variety of angles which was awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveDuff
30,As Expected,There really isn't anything fancy about the Hollywood sign. Just cool that you got to see it in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543mandya
40,Iconic when you can see it,"This is Hollwood's biggest attraction and can be seen from many different vantage points in the city. It is a must see. However, it is often covered by pollution or smoke, so sightings can be temperamental.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6296NXryanm
50,Hike up to the sign and get the very best view.,"I will start by saying the locals don't like all the tourists coming up to see the sign. You will see NO access to the Hollywood sign. The truth is it is owned by the city. Since it's not private property you can legally hike up to it. For years I tried to get as close as I could for pictures. Here is the straight dope. You want to drive up the hills from Franklin Ave. Franklin is one block north of Hollywood Blvd. Turn up into the hills from Franklin onto N.Beachwood Dr. this is the street that takes you right up to the trail to get to the sign. Once again you will pass signs that say no access to the Hollywood sign, it's just the locals trying to scare you away. Keep going all the way up.You will be going through the neighborhoods till you come to a gate. It is the gate for the Sunset Ranch. They have horseback riding through the trails. When I went, there was a very helpful security guard at the gate. You have to park on the neighborhood street. I suggest you get there by 10 am for two reasons. It will be easier to find a parking space and it won't be too hot for the hike. The hike is 1.75 miles to the top. The hardest part of the hike is the very first few hundred feet after you are through the gate. It is a steep street until the trail starts. You will see the sign right away and have many different views as you climb. There are plenty of people doing the hike so you shouldn't have a hard time following the trail. There are helpful direction signs along the way. You will also see the LA skyline from many different spots. It takes about an hour or so even if you take your time for pix or rest. At one point you can go right in front of the sign or take the trail up behind it. You can do both going up or coming down. At the very top you are behind the giant letters. You can see towards LA or on the other side look down at Forest Lawn Cemetery. It is well worth the hike and it is easier coming down. Bring water and a snack.I wouldn't wear sandals or flip flops only because of the dust. Except for the very beginning, pretty much anyone that can walk a reasonable distance can make this hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20anad15
40,It's very to see from a distance,"While on a bus tour through Hollywood, I saw the Hollywood sign. It was cool to see but I am not sure if I would say that was the greatest attraction while traveling to Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annajG1440DI
50,Must see,What is a trip to LA without seeing this famous sign... almost everywhere we went we could see this sign. One of the top places on my to do list.... Worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dnnklly
30,Saw it,Saw it from a distance. If you are really into Hollywood then okay. Otherwise it is a large sign on a hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommV3375EO
40,Iconic Landmark,"One of the most recognisable landmark in LA. I believe, there are many places to spot the sign. We chose the easiest one which is Hollywood/Highland centre mall.Took the red line metro rail and got down at Hollywood/Highland stop. Go up 2 levels to the street. Mall is at the corner of Hollywood Blvd & Highland Avenue. 50 ft tall nine letters can be spotted from the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kitta2
40,Private tour,Hire a private tour company. Out tour guy was great. Took us to the closest spot to Hollywood sign ( no one there). He had a lot of info and history and did a great job. Cost 500 for 4.5 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/133donnaf
50,Pretty Cool,"Go on the We love LA tour and tour Hollywood. Carlos knows a spot that gets you close and no one is there. I hear you can Hike up t here but its not necessary . Take a peek.,take a couple picks. Look at the view from Mulholland and go tour somewhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sansa31
50,A must see in L.A.,The well known landmark - a must see in L.A. area. You can get good views from the observatory. Don't forget to bring your selfie stick :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WolframKarbid
40,Awesome to see!,Loved seeing the famous sign in person! Was lucky to get a pretty close park and there were plenty of people around but still heaps of space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797hamishw
50,Its Huge!!,We saw the Hollywood sign from various places and took some good photos. The only way to get near it is to drive up as far as possible then walk the rest of the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NucciaNice
30,Popular,It is popular and unique. Worth to see it from a distance. Could be tough walk for those who are not use to walking and so avoid it Nothing great from top. View and enjoy from distance,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sorabh
40,Iconic view,"Nice iconic view, much seen before in movies. Glad to have seen it on site from the Griffith park. Very crowded though in the park and difficult to park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ina_31
50,Make the hike,After speaking to locals majority havent been. I made the hike and it took most of the day due to parking issues but was well worth it. Bring water and a snack. Also use the bathroom before you think about coming here. But the views and pictures were well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solomonp89
50,A MUST DO PHOTO,Saw the Hollywood sign in 3 locations. The first was walking along the Walk of Fame just off a side street.The next was from the Griffin Observatory and the third time was i thought was the best location and to see the sign and a better photo was Lake Hollywood Park.A must photo to do when in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddier576
50,So cool to see!,"Seeing the Hollywood sign in person was so unreal! Glad to have gone and seen it! If you want to get closer wear tennis shoes, you can hike and there is a lot of dirt around. Overall, great tourist attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveljunkie423
40,Enjoy it from a distance.,Don‚Äôt go on a tour right up to it. You just irritate the neighbors and it doesn‚Äôt really add to the experience. Enjoy it from the mall at Hollywood and Highland or the observatory or (here is secret) from the top of the parking garage at the Farmers market at 3rd and Fairfax. There are a zillion angles to view it from throughout LA. Enjoy it as a backdrop to the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670charliep
40,Nice ride,If you want to see the Hollywood sign search for it on Hollywood Sign view point. It is a very nice ride going through the neighborhoods going to the top of the mountain to see the overlook.Unfortunately it is quite a distance from the sign hard to get up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjsandra
40,Hollywood,It is an experience that you will never forget. It is lovely to see the sign. It is beautiful sight to see. Well worth seeing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesuperdee
30,Popular sign,"Well, I saw it and I am happy I had the opportunity. Not because it is something great but just because it is very popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreBMalta
30,Get ready for a hike,"Worth it to us but do it early in the morning. Pla around 2 and a half to 3 hours.total. Fantastic view of Los Angeles from up there.Went with my wife, brother and sister in law and we recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfk1963
40,Don't disturb the neighborhood,"There are a few good places to view and photograph the sign. The problem becomes parking and traveling and local residential streets. This must be very annoying to the residents. Some tourists I've witnessed were just plain rude, and loud, and sometimes intoxicated. If you do a little research on-line you will find a dog park where you can park and walk uphill to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood. This may be tough for folks who cannot go the distance or uphill. The view there is good, and you may also see the Hollywood reservoir. Also consider the Griffith Planetarium to see it at more of a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/727danielm727
50,My Kids Loved This,My children got up early just so they could take a picture with the Hollywood Sign in the background. They really enjoyed this even though they were not doing much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941selenam
50,A Beacon To All Dreamers!,"Let's face it, Hollywood wouldn't be Hollywood without the ... well... Hollywood sign. Back in the mid 90's I had a studio apartment on Sycamore that had a view of the Hollywood sign. It was so magical to wake up to that image. These 9 gigantic letters sitting up on a hill is a beacon to all dreamers, much like the Statue Of Liberty was to the immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. This of course, is a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/642marlam
50,Well worth the climb!,It is quite a hike up the hill. It is not too steep though. We walked down a different way through the street which was very nice too! It's a great photo opportunity for us tourists!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5860PDvictoriah
30,Cool to see in person,Sign is visible from many spots....wear comfy shoes if you are going to hike up. Its a workout. lots of tours go up...try groupon for a deal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gr8Brit123
20,Disappointing,They say it's a must stop that you need to see it when you come to LA but you can have pretty nice view of it in the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angyvotravel
40,Best place to see the sign?,"After walking around Hollywood for a few days I was surprised just how hard it was to get good glimpses of the sign. So here are a few tips on how I managed to see it and get some good shots without going to huge efforts.Firstly you can‚Äôt just drive right up to the sign and hang out under one of the letters. It‚Äôs way off in the hills and cordoned off by gates and security. There are walks and trailheads to the sign apparently but these require time and planning (you can get up behind the sign and look down over LA)I found the best views were from the top Hollywood & Highland mall, and especially from the Griffith Observatory. And the plus here is that the Observatory itself is such a great attraction with amazing views out to LA in the other direction. It‚Äôs totally possible to get good selfies from the Observatory with the Hollywood Sign behind you, and let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs what the people‚Äôs want! Of course there may be better vantage points, but these were the two I thought were the best based on my travels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7
30,It's just a sign,"We saw the sign from the Griffith Observatory. Oh well, we saw it. We weren't overwhelmed. It's just a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaracQ2713OL
30,Coveted photo scene of Hollywood sign is an illusion,One cannot access the Hollywood sign but can get close and still take photos. I felt that it was better to see it from the Griffith Observatory than to try and get to it...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semedigital
30,Not a must do,We saw the sign from 3 different angles on various tours and once you have 1 picture they are pretty much all the same.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rach_Kelly
40,Up Close and what the heck is going on!,"Hollywood sign used to mean something right now it is something you want to be as far as from it. Still you want to get close to take some pictures and make sure you were there. You want to be close to the sign, but not so close to those running...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FreeJohnny
50,Hollywood Sign and Must Do in Hollywood,"There are many places that you can actually see the sign. You can get pictures from various mall parking lots but if you go to Lake Hollywood Park or the Griffith Observatory, you get the best pictures. The neighborhood has such beautiful parks and homes. Yes, it is just a sign but it is a famous sign and many people are doing what you will be doing. Parking is atrocious. Get there earlier for better parking. Or you can park down the hill and walk. This is a very steep hill. My 84 year old Mom had trouble just keeping her balance on the steep sidewalk, but it was worth the trip and the priceless picture. You can also view the sign from the walk of Fame or take a Hollywood tour and the bus will bring you to the sign. Whatever you do, get there so you can say that you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swok13
30,Its just a sign,"So ok I am one of those tourists who wanted a picture of the sign. But seriously its just a sign and perhaps evidence that I have actually been to Hollywood.Our guide advised us that its really hard to get a close up picture of the sign as the residents up in the hills want to protect their privacy, something I don't blame them for.You can get great views of the sign on Hollywood Blvd at Hollywood & Highland Mall. You go up the escalators towards Loewes and its a great place to take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommomelbourne
50,Iconic Sign!,"My friend and I wanted to go see the sign and get some good pictures. We drove to Lake Hollywood Park, and walked a short distance (UPHILL) to some picture spots. We went 1st thing in the AM. I would recommend the AM - lots of parking and few people. You can see the sign from lots of spots around LA - but this spot it up close.The hill is steep - so be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jend859
40,At last Hollywood sign,"This sign is very famous, we all watvhed it in many movies. From our hotel we took uber and uber took us at last point, after thet we should walked about 10 minutes for this sign. At the place that we could saw it, not so many people, you could took many pictures with out being interupted by other people took pictures.my sugesstion is bring enough water and enjoyed this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJNugraha
40,"It's a sign, but it's THE SIGN!","Yes, it is a sign and only a sign, but it is THE Hollywood Sign. There are a lot of spots to actually see the sign, one of them being from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, another being from the Griffith Observatory, and then to actually take a tour to get up there. I took a tour and got right up close and personal, but the reason I chose to do a tour is because the last time I was in LA, it was so foggy you couldn't see in front of your face and I wanted to make sure that I saw the sign this time. Parking is insane, but if you go to the Griffith Observatory, you can see it beautifully. If it's a clear day, you can see the sign from the Walk of Fame, or you can take a tour, not worry about parking, and just get up close and personal with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbrenz
50,Iconic Sign of LA,This place is reachable by hike but i got the picture of this sign from a huge shopping plaza at Hollywood blvd. A must photo for memories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UsamaPerwez
50,"Great view, awesome hike!","We ubered from our hotel in hollywood to the entrance of the ""difficult"" level hike. We entered through a neighborhood which the uber driver knew about. The hike took about 2 hours. We went at 8:00am so there weren't too many tourists. It's quite a hike up the mountain, there are great places to stop for pics but very little shade. We only brought one bottle of water and could have definitely done with a few more. It's a difficult hike so be sure to bring your running shoes, a hat, and sunscreen. We got burnt at 8:00am in the morning with hats and sunscreen. There is a house at the bottom which sells water for a few dollars, he even took CDN currency. A must-do if you are visiting LA. You don't get a great view of the sign from the top, but there is a good landing area on your way back down that shows the sign in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aavenner
50,Might be overhyped but still a bucket list!,Yes this is just a sign but I mean your going to come to L.A and not take the iconic Hollywood sign pic? You can't! There's a lot of spots where you can get a photo I would suggest going to Canyon Lake Dr I think that is the best area. My husband and I parked our car where everyone was parking it wasn't really near any neighborhood so we weren't bothering anyone. There is a park there as well I believe Hollywood Park but not sure. A lot of people taking photos I suggest going really early to avoid the crowds. If you can hike the sign do it! We were going to do it but my husband had a bit of a stomach flu so we decided not to. So happy we came!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404gretell

50,Time Well Spent,"Just a 2 hour roundtrip hike away from the Griffith Observatory which itself is a 5 min drive from the Los Angeles Zoo. Hit the Zoo during the day, then hike to the Hollywood sign at sunset and hit the Observatory at night when you can view the planets and constellations through the telescopes. Free parking at both the Zoo & Observatory . No cost for the hike or entry fee for Observatory; just a fee for Zoo entrance makes this a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raqs2015

40,Go to Lake Hollywood Park for best view!,We tried to see the famous sign on one other trip and it was not viewable due to fog! We were on a mission this time to see it. I found on a blog about this park and our tour guide at WB told us about it too. We made it for sunset at the sign!

I personally don't get it. It is literally a sign. A sign you see over and over again in the movies and on TV and tbh it isn't any better in real life. It seems like everyone there just wanted to see it to tick of their bucket list, but whatever makes you happy. The observatory is just a money making scheme but it does well and looks good. We had to queue the whole way up - lots of traffic and hardly any car spaces. Just see it for free somewhere else.

The best vantage point for viewing is the Griffith Observatory - driving/parking is a nightmare here, the sheer effort it took to get a parking space was horrendous.

30,Not worth the hike!,"We hiked up starting at the observatory. It was about an hour and a half each way with no bathrooms. Towards the end, there is a fork in the road with both sides taking you to the sign. One is 1.3 miles and the other is 1.7 miles. By this time we were hot and tired, so we took the left path (1.3 miles); it was the wrong choice. We ended up seeing the sign from a small landing with no shade and it was still pretty far away - not a good photo op.We didn't have it in us to take the path to the right, but when we were far away enough we visually followed the other path, and it seemed to get much closer. Either way, we got a better pic from the opposite side on our way back about 20 minutes into the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shernandez710
40,Nice to see on a clear day,Unfortunately we were there on a cloudy day and the mist from surrounding mountains did not provide a clear picture of this majestic site. The sign is not as close as we taught.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/885renaldl

40,Worth a visit,"On the one hand, it's just some letters on a hill. On the other, we enjoyed the hike up (more challenging than we expected) and it was cool to get some photos with one of the most famous signs in the world! It was a good way to spend a morning. There was a longer hike where you can go behind the sign but we didn't have the energy by that point (it was hot and humid!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786jamiew
30,"Nice landmark, but expect crowds and smog","We traveled through Hollywood to reach the sign, don't let cinema fool you, this part of town is half filthy slum, half rich snobby neighborhood. The sign was constantly blurred from view by smog from LA's automobile traffic. Upon our approach to Griffith Observatory, we came to an unpleasant sight of a long line of cars slowly ascending the hill. This was followed by struggling to find a place to park for 5 minutes and avoiding people casually walking in the way of the car without looking both ways.Once we finally arrived, we took photos of the most famous location in Los Angeles, only to be frustrated a bit that the haze of smog distorted what should have been a clear view. We need to magnify our cameras and adjust them just to get a good shot.Thankfully the state of California is very committed to going green in the future,so I can tell an old man story to younger generations who get a clear view of the sign: ""Back in my day, you had to wait for the smog to clear to take a picture of that sign!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V8078NCkevins
50,Get Behind the Sign Easily!,We Ubered to half way up Deronda Dr. (You should uber as locals don‚Äôt like you parking there) And walked all the way to the top of it where you come to a gate. You get a few pics of the sign on the way up. You go through the gate and follow the path there- it‚Äôs so easy.There‚Äôs a lot of other ways to get up there that are harder but you‚Äôll see other thing toon- but if you‚Äôre short on time or have kiddies with you then this is the easiest way to get there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/705tanayaw
40,"Just a sign, but iconic all the same",It‚Äôs a must have photo moment to say you‚Äôve been to LA. The driver took us to a spot within residential zone where we snuck up close and got some awesome photos. It really resonates that you‚Äôre in LA when you look at this sign.

40,Iconic Sign,We loved seeing the sign at last and although it seemed to be visible fromeverywhere it was very difficult to get close for good photos. The bext we took were in Griffith Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/144martinn
40,The most famous sign,"A bit overrated as a tourist attraction, but of course you need to see it and take a picture of it:) If you are in a city centre, you can take a look to it from the Hollywood & Highland shopping center (it has a paid parking) terrace. And also you can drive to Griffith Observatory and take an overlook of LA city and the sign too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siomikas
40,Interesting drive,Great drive up through bel air to see the sign. Beautiful houses but very narrow and steep roads.Advantage point to see the sign was good but could have done with a cafe or something to enjoy the view even more,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneWeeks
40,Off the bucket list,"Since we were in LA on business and decided to stay a few extra days, the iconic Hollywood Sign was a must see. Although we had a great view of the sign from our hotel window, we still wanted to get as up close and personal as possible. We traveled up to it through the Griffith Observatory where they have photo spots to pose with the sign behind you. Still pretty far away, one or two pictures and your on your way. BUT you can't come to LA and not see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenr873
30,Iconic Landmark,"The sign of course is great! I saw it at night, but it was not even lit up! I would have liked to have seen it better. Parking to get to area is ridiculous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julieann425
30,Overrated,"OK Folks....let‚Äôs talk about the SIGN! I happened to be showing a friend around my city...they REALLY wanted to see the HS. The best view is up Beachwood Canyon...but the residents get quite upset with tourists who park their cars everywhere and cause chaos in this charming neighborhood....Having said that,if you want the best pics,etc...be considerate, and take a-drive up the street...shoot your pics, and leave quietly. BUT,I guarantee..you‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúSo, that‚Äôs IT??‚Äù All that hype for this????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507bethanyf
30,Still There,"Not sure why this needs a review..? The iconic sign is still there on the hillside, but, unless you have a high quality lens I'd suggest buying a postcard or grabbing a pic off the web. Just not a good angle to get high quality photo with a Smart Phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316per
50,Must see in LA,"This histrionic sign is a must check out in LA. Great to do with friends, family or even alone. I highly suggest this if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reservationsguy
50,Iconic,When I first saw this sign from the 10 freeway in 1989 it sent positive chills down my spine. Then I lived beneath it in on Beachwood and got used to it. Now I go visit it on occasion to remind myself not to become complacent. Best pictures of it are taken from behind it. Look for the picture by Peter Lindbergh. Wonderful. Anyway. Hop the fence and get up close,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nikmid310
30,What is the big deal,"Large sign painted white what is the big deal. You can hike up to the sign, good for excercise. I never have to do this again next time I come to visit, it's a one time deal for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2085GXchrism
40,I supposed you have to see it....,But whether you need to hike up there is another question; you might prefer to save your energies for the many other tourist spots. There are plenty of viewing opportunities from the Main Street (Walk of Fame).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FliesM20P
40,Normal,"The Hollywood sign what it is. Great landmark BUT very crowded, long time and way to get to the view of it, people everywhere, have to pay for parking. But you will definitely get a great view of the city!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_Travel2487
40,Hiked to the sign,"My first activity on my LA trip was hiking to the Hollywood sign (with Ranger Ted, through an air b n b experience, would definitely recommend) - set off at 0830 and did a steep route up to the sign in very hot weather in September. A lovely way to start the day and personally the thing I enjoyed the most while visiting LA for a couple of days. Met some friendly walkers on the path and had great 360 views from the top.From the top of the sign, you get a great view of the city and that really helped me get my bearings. The hike was tiring but manageable, went up to the Wisdom Tree and to the top of Mount Lee - a lovely peaceful bit of nature in a very crowded place.Headed down to the bottom of the hill afterwards to get the view you see in all the pictures and that was good too - think I appreciated it more having been to the top first. If you're torn, definitely go here rather than to the Walk of Fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eloisem390
50,Organised hike with Air B&B,"We actually booked this hike with an Air B&B experience and was amazing. The guide had many stories about the sign, the area and LA and took many fantastic photos for us all in the best spots. It was a 3 hour hike which took us above the sign but with stops for photos. Best trip we‚Äôve done",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMoffett73
50,Bucketlist Ticked,We hiked up to the sign through the Hollywood Hills. Canyon Lake drive is the best place to go. It offers a great views and a good place to take pictures. We got to the sign by getting the bus to beechwood drive from Hollywood blvd and then walking the rest. You could drive but the roads are narrow and there aren't many places to stop. The sign is iconic and surreal to see up close. A must do when in Los Angeles!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Interailtraveller
40,A Wow Experience!,"So you see it on TV but seeing it in person is surreal. The look out point I viewed it from was as impressive and awe-inspiring as the actual Hollywood Sign itself! Totally cool experience, highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dagoboi
50,Obvious must See!,No trip to LA would be complete without a look at the Hollywood Sign. Best spot for viewing would definitely be Canyon Lake Dr however do be prepared for crazy traffic on narrow mountain roadways and parking is only street parking which can be hard to find,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missskyangel
40,Was unable to get anywhere near it,Although just to see it is amazing and you can always have your picture taken with it in the background üòäAug 2004,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5141TLnataliek
50,So Surreal,I can't believe I actually saw the real Hollywood sign with my own two eyes. I've been seeing it on the TV for years and never thought I would actually get to be here and experience it for myself! It's great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verniceb2018
30,Meh,"Seriously, it is just a bunch of letters on a hill. I guess it is cool to use as a backdrop for photos so your Facebook friends know you were in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superdrag
50,Saw from a distance,"We were told you can hike up closer to the Hollywood sign or take a helicopter over it, we unfortunately did not have time for eirher of those but we for food photos from the hill up by the Griffiths Observatory. Cool piece if history that everyone knows about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714kalier
40,Drove by on Freeway,Very visible as we drove North on 101. Traffic (slow) allowed my wife to get a few pictures.We've seen this iconic LA sign from different perspectives and it's always a fun experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurpleLightworker
20,Not allowed,"Half of the roads through the park and to the observatory were blocked off, so we weren‚Äôt able to do anything but drive in a circle. The drive toward it was our only photo op...disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessicapK921HP
40,Good workout!,I went on an early Friday morning and took the brush canyon trail to the Hollywood sign. It took about 45-50 minutes to get to the signs and the view was quite nice. It was around 8-9am when I reached my destination but it was already quite hot! I highly recommend 1L of water minimum and lots of sunscreen and a cap.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658gracies
40,Iconic,The Hollywood sign can be viewed from several parts of Hollywood but does have a special viewpoint closer by.There is plenty of parking space for those who drive up to the viewpoint (don't recommend walking up!).The viewpoint is one of the nicest and most peaceful parts of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelReviewer1983
50,Great to see!,This is a must see. A little hard to get to but we got a local tip to watch the YouTube video which did the trick nicely.I would strongly suggest the hike which I couldn't do due to a recovering injury but it looked amazing!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troym458

50,Brill,A must see when you get there.A Icon to view and a must see to be done.Get as close as you can. You can drive up the hill to get a bit closer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zitziubummer
50,Must see in LA,It's a legendary symbol of LA and you just can't miss it.There are various places from where it's visible and you can get a good shot of the sign.It's even visible from Griffith Observatory.There is a decent place called Hollywood park which is perfect place to get a closer look of he sign.Google it and you will find it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anand1351
40,"Quick stop, iconic","A nice quick stop as we were driving, great for pictures however could offer some facilities. So peaceful and wold recommend seeing LA iconic sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emeraldelegance0
50,Where's real 'Hollywood'?,"In 1995, when I drove with my cousin, I saw this sign and asked #Where's Real Hollywood?#. He told me that it's right below & this sign is under 'Video Surveillance'. This was something unheard off in those days. Now (in 2017) when I got to see the Hollywood sign from Griffith park; I asked my family to capture a few snaps. It's historical right? Never miss to read about it in Wikipedia... Before or after the visit. It's Amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cshastry2
40,Small but surreal,"Was very surreal to see the iconic Hollywood sign in real life. It is really, really far in the distance but still awesome to see it with your own eyes and not only in the movies :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyDays123321
30,Iconic sign to prove you went to Los Angeles,"There are much better places to visit in LA but, this is a must visit and photo because it a world famous Iconic , it is visible from many places . If you can climb you can go close otherwise Griffith Observatory is the best place to take a good photo.To go to Griffith you can take DASH bus and it's very cheap and convenient, it will be crowded in the evening but really worth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aadhes
50,Iconic,"Though it's not easy to get to, it's an iconic photo op while in the area. We were lucky to land an uber driver who grew up in LA and knew how to get us as close as possible to the sign and we were able to see the nearby lake as well. It's beautiful up there, but really you can see the sign from many wonderful and easier to get to places around town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a5brown
40,"Must see, Iconic sign",Saw this sign from several places. Best seen from The Griffith Observatory over lunch and a drink! However you can walk to the sign from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832carolt
30,"Not easy to get to, can view from elsewhere","Following the GPS to get to the sign is not easy - long and winding uphill road. And the view from the public parking place is actually not very close to the sign (as in the first picture). You have to zoom in a bit to get a decent size of the sign in a photo. If you are crunched for time, I'd suggest getting a view of the sign from the Griffith Observatory instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467rachelz
40,Iconic Must See,"As part of the Ultimate Hollywood Tour, we stopped at the Hollywood overlook location for a photo opportunity. Very cool to be able to see a good part of LA and the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhino2525
40,We made the long walk to the Holly wood sign.,We started from Hollywood Blvd and walked up Bronson Street. We got up to the park were the road ended. Then we took the trail to Hollywood sigh by the Tyrolian tank. There is a sorter walk but we wanted to get the best view. It was 2.3 miles from where the trail began. It was a nice day for walking. and a bit of uphill. Yo can't a great view of he sign from here. Just be ready to walk a little to get there. There is also a great view of the city from there. We were a late thirsty after we got there. There was a sign by the gate cold drinks 50 feet below. Someone with a nice place and view had some nice sofas to sit on and was selling things are a very low price. We had a pleasant conversation. Then it was time to go down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnYa5
30,Big sign,"Good thing it's so big, because you can only get close by hiking a LOT! We looked at it from the Griffith Observatory scenic area. Iconic and the cool factor is huge, but it's a long way over to it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/g3times
50,"""Horray for Hollywood""","Take time to visit Hollywood Blvd. It's very bright in the nighttime. Look for your favorite stars on the walk of Fame. The Chinese Theatre had many famous stars as does most all of Hollywood and Vine. The open mall next to the Dolby Theatre is spectacular. There is a Ghirardelli chocolate shop that sends tasty aroma by it's front door. Yummy! The Hard Rock Cafe was rocking! La La Land Souvenirs stocked anything you might want to take home. During the day the visit is good, but don't miss the nightlife!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoop35311
40,A famous landmark,"You cannot get that close to this famous sign (unless you hike a great deal on dirt paths). The sign once read HOLLYWOODLAND,but the LAND was removed. To take a picture, park someplace where you can, and snap your picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
40,The most important,This is the most important sign because this IS Hollywood. It represents the whole idea. We watched It from our hotel and when we were driving around in the LA nearby the mountains.,
30,It's a sign,"What can you say? It's an iconic sign. It's not easy to get to. I know people can hike below it. We went to Griffith Observatory in order to have a nice, unobstructed view of the sign.You can see the sign at various locations around Los Angeles.",
30,Cool to see if you never have.,"First, you cannot get very close to it. The letters are 50' high but you are so far away from it you would never guess that. We used a GPS to head up that way and ended up stopping at the point we were the closest, which was still at least 1/2 mile away. Turns out there was a homeowner that was overly protective of the area. We stopped in a parking area and he got bent out of shape that the bumper of our car blocked a big flower pot on the edge of his driveway. He came out screaming about not respecting him and going off about blocking his driveway and all sorts of things like that. Granted we were in the way of his drive, but A. he was not trying to get out and B. he would have to avoid the flower pot anyhow which means he had his own obstruction that was blocking his drive whether we were there or not. He was also videoing cars on the other side of the street and calling the cops on them because they were stopped in a no parking zone. Understand they were not even close to his property, he was just an unhappy person. If you GPS your way to view the sign and you get to a road that appears to lead up to it but has a sign ""No Hollywood Sign Access"" you will see his house on your left so be sure you park in the few designated parking spots. He would not even answer if we could walk up the street from where we were parked. He did finally calm down a bit and pointed us to a public parking area farther on down the road that provided the best public location to view and photograph the sign, but you were probably at least 1 mile away at that location.",
50,Take a hike of view from the Observatory,One of my fave. views of this sign isn't from the freeway. It's from the trails surrounding Griffith Park Observatory. You get an amazing 360 view of LA - and if its clear - out to the ocean. There are tons of walking and hiking trails for all abilities.,
30,Fine view,"It was a fun experience to see the sign close up (or closer - because you're still pretty fra from it) but my friend and I had a guided tour up there, and there were plenty of space to take good pictures.If you're up for a small hike, I would definitely recommend seeing this!",
30,"i suppose its a must see,,","its miles away,,,lol you see it off the tour buses when driving around, but to try and get close to it for a decent pic and its a nightmare,,bit disappointing really",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180russelld

50,Good to see,"Worth viewing, the views across the city and Jill's from the sign are beautiful. Well worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moreholidaysplease87
50,A must visit.,"If you are able while in LA you should really visit the sign. It is worth it just for the view. The roads are rather winding and you do go up steep roads, which are residential. Don't forget the sun cream if you go in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliegD1438XJ
40,that is the must to have a photo,"as a land mark of the Hollywood you just need to see it yourself. You may see this sign even from Hollywood Bilvar,. The best to watch it from Griffins Observatory while sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexaKPL
40,Secret spot for the best photo opportunity,"As a cliche English couple on a road trip from San Francisco to San Diego in a red Mustang, we needed a photo with the car and Hollywood sign.The usual tourist route is good but you can get closer!Head towards the hills up North Beachwood Drive. Turn left onto Ledgewood Drive. The normal route will take you straight to the viewing spot.On Ledgewood Drive when you see a sign for Deronda Drive turn right and follow the route, it's a dead end but at the top is the best view of the Hollywood sign.Parking officers patrol the area, you just have to be lucky to get a space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardStuttle
20,"Over-rated photo op, you must pass on this","I really don't know what the allure is with this place? Everyone seems to feel that this is the ultimate destination when visiting Hollywood. You'll spend a lot of time getting to a street with a view and then that's it. It will be on your Facebook banner for a week and that's it. Pass on this and visit the places that really make Los Angeles cool. I recommend going to the Warner Bros VIP Tour in Burbank, CA. You'll spend a half day there but you will get to see a real studio with real TV and film sets. When visiting LA, use your time wisely because traffic will really take a bite out of your vacation time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldavid30
50,A nice Drive,"You will see homes that are gorgeous on the way to the sign. We went as part of the whole LA experience. It is fun to see this icon,but we went to stores and then to lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSReviewer007
40,Great for all,"LA is really the spot that everyone comes to and expect to see the Hollywood sign. It is not easy to come to this location and actually see the sign unless you know how to get there. With all of the residential restrictions and the signage that intends to deceive the tourist, it's not an easy place to get close to the sign. Get creative and keep pushing forward to get as close as you can. I really wish LA would get a grip and make a specific spot so people could come up and get close to the sign‚Ä¶ It's iconic‚Ä¶ And it's totally worth it. Have a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cocos1776
40,a must go !,"Use Canyon lake drive (even if it says no access to hollywood sign""...You will have a great view of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D4359KDpeterm
50,Nice hike/walk for a view of the city,"This is a classic, and an easy go-to hike. You can access the trail from the observatory, but I usually park in the neighborhood of Hollywoodland, on N Beachwood Drive. The best view of the sign is not actually at the end of the hike, but right at the beginning, when you can turn and see the entire sign on the hill - the best place to take pictures if you want to have the sign in the background. The short hike to the top is worth it, however, and you'll get a great view as you sit behind the sign and look out onto the city. If you hike from the neighborhood or the observatory, most of the path is hard dirt or paved road - hiking from other areas of Griffith Park can have more narrow paths and steeper inclines. Safe and well trafficked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gabrielles
40,Saw it and left,"This was on my bucket list, not quite sure why after seeing it LOL. It's very difficult to get close to it unless you have the patience driving around in Los Angeles. We ended up seeing it on a Stars tour. We were able to get pictures of it, pretty much saw it and left. Very uneventful and not as exciting as we thought. But we got to see it and now we can say we did. Been there done that wouldn't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Momma252

50,"Hollywood Hills and the famous ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign.","When I was invited to stay at my Son's & Daughter in Law's cliff hugging home in these hallowed hills, it became an experience unlike any from when I lived in Laurel Canyon. This community id composed of a proud group whose properties are well maintained. Much more interesting than.boutique Beverly Hills. The beauty of canyon is marshalled by the famous sign, an antennas building and the famous Observatory. One straight aveue like thevtrunknof a tree delivers you to the hiking trail that leads you to the sign. I found many wondering pilgrims from many countries on the branch roads, lost in direction. Yet, I also found many of the residents anxious to help and even drive them to the trailhead. I decided to follow the spirit.Result was the meeting of many college age students from France, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Russia. They were all here on Summer break discovering the wonders of nature.

Son decided to run up to behind the sign and meet us back at the caf√©. Son very fit but it took him 3 hours in all and had to get additional water from the park rangers (water tanks had run dry that day) Path is very clearly marked and easy to follow. Everyone we meet on the route was friendly. Daughter & I happy we made it that far in the heat, son however was disappointed with the amount of effort it took to get behind the sign for the view he got - the views are better at the front of the sign and from the observation points on the way up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julesfhants

40,hiking to the sign,I found it difficult to navigate where to start the hike to the sign so thought I'd write a review of how my friend and I did it.Starting point: Griffith observatoryParking: go early. Lots of spaces $4/hour by machine (cash or card but no change given)What to wear : it gets hot so dress light. Sneakers are fine. Hiking boots not necessary.Entering: there are two ways to get to the trail from the Griffith observatory entrance.Option one: (longer more intense hike) is to look for the Hollywood trail sign towards the woods in the parking lot *photo below.Follow that trail and it will take you to itNote: both these trails end up meeting up. Very little chance of getting lostOption two (shorter)Head down hill out of the obervatory parking lot and keep going until you come to a cross walk. A sign will take you to the trail on the right hand side. Just follow the trail up*I didn't bother going all the way to the sign. It was cool just walking through the dry lands. You get some good views of the city and sign (however still far away and small in photos),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/305chelseaj

40,Worth the hike.,"We search the best way to see the Hollywood sign and several reviews said to take Canyon drive to the very end, park and walk up the trail. ~ so we did just that and the view was perfect!When you get to the end of Canyon drive there is a small parking lot with free parking. The path up to the sign is a dirt path with little shade and very few places to sit.Gotta be honest, it's a hike. Probably 2 miles and going mostly uphill on the way to the sign.Bring water, wear comfy shoes and give yourself 2 - 3 hours to mate the round trip.We did see some people on an escorted horse ride but no cars, bikes or motorcycles are allowed on this path.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2travel19892
40,Have you been there?,Decades ago I had the opportunity to go all the way up to the sign. That was a great experience. I don't think that you can do that now. Restricted area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnb9291
50,A must see!,Beautiful views from many different locations. Parking can be difficult so it's best to go early to beat the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosec799
50,Iconic,"Hollywood lake park, Hollywood Blvd, Griffith National park, Canyon lake drive or the hike up to the sign are some of the best ways to see the sign and get a great photo op.",
50,Icon,A must must must see when in Hollywood makes you know you have arrived in Los Angeles. Great photos from a lot of the city,
50,Hollywood Sign,You can see the Hollywood Sign from many many different places around Hollywood. You can get up and personal to it if you want to take the chance of getting caught as I don't think they allow you up there that close.If you're visiting Hollywood and your cute female and when somebody to show you around... Hit me up.,
40,Just to say you were near,"It's iconic and it seems a shame not to try to get nearer. However, a walk in 35 degree heat by a couple approaching 60 and not overly fit was clearly not going to happen. As it happens many other younger, fitter people felt the same and there were a huge amount of cars trying all routes to get there. Police were stopping people driving and walking so glad we didn't try. We got lots of photos but you only really need one - nothing changes!",
50,Walk and Hike,Great location to go for a hike to get to the sign. Prepare to walk and hike for at least an hour to get to the sign. Bring water and sunblock during the summer time.,
30,Long way away !,"Could only get a good photo with a zoom lens as the letters are quite small, not as impressive as expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502nicolar
40,It's Up on the Hill,"I've never climbed the steep hill to be next to the sign, but you can't miss it on a clear day. It's been restored and looks great. Originally an ad for a real estate development, now a landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,Look at it from the Griffin Observatory,"We were told to go to the Griffin Observatory and hike to the sign from there....well, that would be great if we were 20 years younger. It was a hot day and it's a long walk, and even then we were told by the parking attendant, that you can't really get to the sign from that hike. So we just took a picture from there and left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindak583
30,A must if you are in LA for the first time,"We drove through Mulholland HWY and looked at the sign slightly from below. There were no other cars or people there and there were only a few places to park. It was completely clear to the sign and could, if you wanted to go a little closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Couple_H_A

50,It's a thrill the first time you see it!,This iconic sight in Hollywood is a must-see! It's a thrill the first time you see it--- and magical at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2017love2travel2017
40,Iconic -- can't not go to see and take pictures,"You can drive pretty close, through residential neighborhoods, and get some great pictures of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiS942
40,As Always Fun To See,As always a fun spot to see while visiting the Hollywood LA area. Views are better from a distance instead of being up close as the streets are very narrow to try to get a decent view of clothes of the sign. There are ways to get closer to the sign and even possibly hike up to it but you would have to get a map to try to find the exact route to get there and the most appropriate place to park has the Neighbors in the area below the sign get a little testy with all of the traffic driving up and down there Street and parking in front of their homes,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazers04
20,Couldn't get to it.,Just look at it from the streets of Hollywood. Driving there is an impossible nightmare. We were in a queue driving all the way up to see it and we're not allowed to stop so I had to leap out the car and take a really quick photo. It wasn't a place you could enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/case1984
50,Picture Perfect!!1,One cannot go to Hollywood and not get a photograph in front the picturesque sign. Everything anyone would dream to be witness to. From movies to reality. There are days where could be quite hazy so checking the weather would be a plus before visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnathank299
50,Good trail walk in the morning,"We took the Aileen Getty Ridge Trail, which proves nice and easy for a morning hike.It could use better guidance (signs) in the lower part, but the view from the path and the top compensates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adinelt
30,"Been there, seen it, done that",Good place to make a selfie with the sign in the background is from Griffith Observatory. Easiest to park the car near the Greek Theatre and take the shuttle bus for $0.50 per person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterjanse
50,Worth the hike,I still love hiking up to the sign. It is such an iconic thing in LA and oh can get surprisingly close on the trails at Griffith park. Just go early in the morning or close to sunset so parking is easier. Bring water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C6916QGandream
30,Its a sign,Gotta take a picture so you can say you've seen it but that's about it. It's big. It's white and it's on a hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinm250
10,Nothing great,This is the only thing that I liked little bit is the Hollywood sign on the mountain but it's overhyped so even if I had missed this Hollywood guided city tour I could have atleast gone shoppingüòÄ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thadeshwar
40,Great,"This is definitely a tourist spot. Very crowded, especially if you do it from Griffith Park. Use Mulholland Drive (Hollywood Hills) to get a closer view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322wandal
40,at least it hasn't gone digital,Staying in the hills below we had great views...a marker to the changes that have transcended the famed areas below...one can imagine the excitement of days gone by,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnnycash3630
40,Far view of the sign,"As you cannot visit the sign because it's really difficult the access, one option is the mall in Dolby Theatre to see it in the hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PezFish
50,A not-to-be-missed photo op,"You've just got to take a photo of yourself in front of the Hollywood sign!! Getting there is fairly easy but be warned - there is NO PARKING nearby so I suggest taking a bus or taxi/Uber. Also if you're meeting someone up there, arrange an exact location beforehand because reception is very inconsistent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katbot56
40,It's got to be done,"Yeah it's great to see the iconic sign but no way I have won't be a priority the next time. Be mindful of parking as it does get really busy and the police are always on patrol. Please be mindful that this whole area is a non smoking environment due to the heat and dryness of the area, this is also monitored very carefully as some people found out on the trip. Pleased I took the time to see the sign though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs242015
40,just to see,"to get to the view deck is an escalator and go down the steps. Shops are around and it was appreciative that when we were there, people took a photo and left so others can have a space too. Otherwise it would be too chaotic, what is lacking is an explanatory description in the view deck. ( I may have missed it) the guide said it used to be called Hollywood land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsbtfdn
50,Must See,Just seeing the signs lets you know that you finally made it to Hollywood. Nice area to drive around to take in the sites and see how the other half lives.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
50,We were in clouds,We were in clouds both time we tried to good see this up close . But you can see it from the I -5 freeways so we are happy .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13521F2
40,Dream come true,I had always wanted to visit this place from ages and finally got the chance and it was great. To see those big letters was dream come true. The best place to see the sign is from Griffith Park but you can go for a 1 and a half hour hike to get to the exact sign location if you are up for a walk. I am sure anyone who gets to this place will enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/841niranjanl
30,Sign,"Not much to say about the Hollywood sign it's just an iconic landmark, you will definitely have a great view from the Griffin Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tigger845
50,A must do in Hollywood!,"A Defenectly must thing todo while visiting L.A.Must be prepared,when hiking to this iconic sign.Make sure,you have plenty of water,snacks,food,cause to get to the Hollywood spot and sign you need plenty.The views as you hike the trails are breathless.Once you reach the top,you'll feel like you aconplished something so grand in your life.Youll see the entire L.A area and Burbank also.Just doit and go!!",
50,Best place for picture,"The best place to take a picture of the Hollywood sign is the Lake Hollywood park. Just add this name into your Google maps and drive directly to the place.Easy to park and take pictures.I went there Friday noon, easy. Maybe weekend too busy.",
50,Really cool up close,Went to Hollywood lake park and got perfect picture in five minutes. It's awesome up close. When you see it from a distance it doesn't seem as awesome.,
50,Nice view,Great attraction that gets you away from the hustle and bustle of city and up in the mountains....parking is on steep angles and very limited but worth the effort,
20,Uninteresting,"Driving up in Beverly hill we has a good look over the valley to this famous sign!This is really nothing special, just some letters on a hillside!After having seen the sign so many times on movies etc it was a real disappointment",
50,Hollywood!!,If you go to LA you have to visit Hollywood Blvd and you will get great opportunity to for a photo of the sign. Also if you take the hop on hop off bus you can get a clear view of the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shirljennings
50,Beautiful experience,"It was a heck of a hike but worth it! The view from up there it's beautiful, I still can't believe that I made up there and back down but every aspect of it was worth! Just make sure you take only sips of water as you go up because there's a lot of going up hills than downward.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Departure220170
50,Don't google this!,If you search for Hollywood Sign on google maps it is highly likely you will be directed Griffith Observatory and this is not the best view of the sign. It is also horrendously busy. The best view is from Griffith National Park accessed from Deronda Drive where parking is virtually impossible. You can however park in the surrounding roads and take a couple of minutes walk to the National Park where the view is much better than Griffith Observatory. The path is very accessible. There is a bit of a climb if you want to really close. It is a shame not more parking is available here as this really is an iconic symbol of USA and to find not even a single gift shop/visitor centre or even a bench is quite incredible. However if you want to get up close this is the best option. It is accessible from Griffith Observatory if you want to do a three hour round hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesixtysix
50,Great photo spot!,Trip to LA is not complete with out a picture of Hollywood sign in the background. You can get a great view of the sign from the Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
50,Uphill walk,Not for the unfit! Parking is a nightmare and the road up to the sign is blocked off. You have to trust luck to find a parking space and when you do be prepared to walk uphill to viewpoints to get a good photo of the sign. Well worth the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suek447
50,Best View of Hollywood Sign,I recommend driving to Canyon Lake Dr.(Hollywood Reservoir) for the best view of the Hollywood sign. If you have time you can even take a hike up there to get as close as allow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Depasco
50,3000 Canyon Lake Drive,THE best place to see and take pics of the Hollywood sign is 3000 Canyon Lake Drive. Park by the dog walking park and walk up the hill a bit to get the best view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4346OHadama
40,the iconic Hollywood sign,it was neat to see the sign in real life and there were lots of available places to take pictures!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskville
50,A Highlight of LA,This is the iconic Hollywood sign and needs to be seen in person if visiting LA! We were amazed at the size and at its history!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skrose21
50,Ultimate LA experience,"Worth taking the walk up to the top of the road beneath the sign.Maybe it is silly,but there is something magical about seeing this sign in person :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagdaM138
40,Nine large white letters on a hillside,That's all it is. Yet we all feel a little frisson of excitement when we first catch a glimpse. We viewed from Griffin Observatory from which you will need a powerful zoom on your camera! Forget smartphone cameras.Absolutely needs to be seen just to tick it off the list. Hiking up closer would probably be a good idea if you have time and inclination.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chilli_bom_bom
30,Ok for photo,"We stopped overlooking the Hollywood sign while on a tour needed to have a good camera to get a good pic.Ther was also a statue of James Dean,s head .The Griffith observatory was a beautiful building ,we didn't,t get to go inside as our tour wasn't staying long enough",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRADELAIDE
40,Its world famous - worth a visit,"Though you wont get that close to the sign, if you do your homework, you can get mighty close. This was on our Must see list whilst in LA. The area we chose to get our photo wasn't too busy, but it might of been as it was mid week and in a residential area. Worth a trip up the hill to get a famous photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotmarwal
30,It's just a sign - but very famous!,So it's iconic and if you're in LA you have to see it but it is just a sign and probably isn't worthy of a review!Good place to view it is from Griffith Park but if you don't want to drive up there then go the the mall by the Chinese Theatre,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/434davidj
50,A must see,Certainly a must see to tick off your things to do in Hollywood or for movie lovers.Would recommend going with a tour company or if you personally know a local that can take you up there as there a few roads to manuveour for a visitor who isn't familiar with the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3kpumpkin
50,It is what it is,"This is on my bucket list and have finally seen it. Saw it from Griffith Park, you can also see from the Hollywood walk of fame from the shopping centre which give good views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMM22101963
40,Trek to the right spot for great pictures...,"So, this is great fun for the kids. There are a lot of folks coming to see this, so you have to plan when and how.We went in the morning. We were staying in Beverly Hills, so it was a short drive (with usual LA congestion, construction, etc....).The best thing we did was Google Map what we wanted to do before we did it. DON'T JUST DRIVE UP THERE. ITS A ZOO.We went before 10 AM. This was a great time - no traffic, easy parking. Use the Canyon Lake Dr route, not the Mulholland route. The Mulholland side is crazy. No one was on the Canyon Lake side. Quick, free parking at trailhead. We walked for about 15 min on the Innisdale trail, seeing a bunch of good views of the HOLLYWOOD sign along the way.We could pick our photo ops. Part of a complete LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13joea
40,Good Place for a Photo,"Kids and I stopped for about 30 minutes. The park is a good place to stop and take pictures. But do not stop on the road, locals will get mad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasoncoe
40,Iconic,"As iconic as it is, of course everyone needs their picture taken with it. Seems hard to get a good vantage point, but one of the better ones I found was from Griffith Observatory. Down side is that it is way in the distance and shows up small in the photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hottoddy88
30,Nice to See,Not a lot else to say. It is nice to see but us a long way in the distance. A lot of hype over what is in effect just a sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenaL305
40,Go early - super crowded,"Be prepared for crowds and traffic - very little parking so be prepared to walk. I'd recommend going early. Took 30 minutes to drive 1mi to get to the observatory - there was no parking, the staff were waving people though the exit as soon as they got to the top because the lots were full. My friend and I jumped out of the car, ran to take a quick picture and hoped back in as my husband got to the exit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Krissy027
40,Nice place to take picture,"It easy to find great spot to visit there, you write Hollywood sign in the WAZE and its take you to best spot to take picture with the sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ADaminko
50,A must do,We walked uphill in high temperatures for nearly 2 miles and it was all worth it when we got there. A clear view of the sign and you couldn't have got any nearer. I was expecting it to look shabby but it was pristine and we all felt an achievement at getting to it. Wouldn't do it again but it had to be done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ward50
30,Not as bright as I remember it,I don't know if it was hazy that day but the sign itself looked like it needed cleaning. It was almost gray. I don't know if it was because the mountain was brown but it didn't stand out like I remember it did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankC109
50,Impossible turning a blind eye,"The cult of the power of movies industries that was but even is now. For all remains THE HOLY STAR. Look üëÄ at it from different places. From Holly Blvd, from rive gauche et droit. Walk everywhere and suddenly watch it. You are on stage. It's your moment of celebrity. I pick this pic up for showing a place where u can watch at it. Go up second or third floor. Enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194gianlucav
30,Underwhelming,"We visited the Griffith Observatory to see this. As LA is mostly hazy, the views aren't clear and the sign is so small or hardly appears on photos. If you're not that bothered, don't bother!",
50,It's Iconic..... & a must see when you are in Hollywood!,It's one of those things you have to see when in Hollywood. We seen it twice but didn't feel the need to get up and personal with it. We seen it from the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Blvd (go to the back and you will see people taking pictures) & from Mulholland Drive when we were on a tour of the city.,
50,A must do in LA,"Whilst it is only a sign, it is one of the most iconic in the world so definitely should be included in any visit to LA - there are great views of the sign off of Mulholland drive, Hollywood and Highland Shopping Centre, Griffith Observatory to name but a few.",
50,Awesome,There are a lot of ways to get to the signU cant walk to the sign it self there are police officers up thereBut it was awesome,
20,See it best from Griffith Observatory. Meh,"We happened to see this while visiting the observatory. Didn't go out of our way for it. Because parking sucks everywhere up there at Griffith Park and Observatory, you get a few good views of the Valley and Sign if you remember to turn around.They don't light it up often due to vandalism. My brother who is an LA local has done the hike to get closer to the Sign and said it's alright, but definitely ""a hike.""I'm from the east coast, so just checking this off the list of things to see. Meh.",
50,Accidental spotting,"At the entrance of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, if you turn around and face away from the cemetery... you'll get an AMAZING shot!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamPack1965
40,Cool up close,To see well you need to drive up to lake Hollywood park. You can get great pictures and the drive up there is beautiful!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulhM8150LI
50,Do it once!,Everyone has to do it at least once! Its just what you expect but always cool to see the pictures you took several months/years later and know you have done it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BreakThroughReno
50,Worth the View,A landmark in Hollywood. The sign has changed some over the years. It would not be Hollywood with out this landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wa6flr
30,iconic,We didn't bother paying for a tour just to see this iconic sign. It was easily viewed from a shopping mall just off Hollywood/Vine. Iconic and historic and once you have seen it you can almost breath in the history of Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raheny11
40,GOOD BUT HARD TO GET TOO,It was hard to see and pictures weren't taken easily parking was close as well as restaurants. It is still iconic and a must go because of its sheer popularity must go attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmelieRule
40,Classic,"The Hollywood Sign is one of the best known landmarks around the world. Take the backroad there as the mainroad is so freaking packed. Also, you can leave your car and hike the way. This will get you a better view than most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate463955
30,Only One Of Its Kind,"i was only able to view the HOLLYWOOD sign from the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park. According to my tour guide that's as close as one can come to it. I'm not sure if he only meant as close as a tour bus can get to it. It's a must see because of its history and cultural contribution. It is also important to learn the history of how it began, almost was taken down and how it survived and was newly constructed of more everlasting materials. The Hollywood Sign is iconic and a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LorraineConnecticut
50,A must do,"We parked in Griffith Park, and took the 3.5 mile hike each way to the back of the sign. Bring comfortable shoes that you don't care if they get dirty...and WATER!!!! The view is unbeatable. Make sure you ask directions on where to start. We went the wrong way at first and added an extra mile each way. The route starts at the tunnel..where you see two white gates. The first mile or so is on a paved road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheJerf

30,Not much to it but fun to check off your bucket list!,"I found several pieces of advice online from locals as to the best way to access the sign. We drove up to Lake Hollywood Park, which gives you a chance to drive Mulholland Drive! Parking there can be crazy but you can get a good photo op here or start your hike up to the sign if you want.

40,"A 6 mile, technically easy hike.","A friend and I shared an Uber from downtown LA to the trail head. The fare was $12.00. The hike to the sign is initially steep, but moderates after 30 minutes and becomes much easier. We were both in out mid 50's and in OK shape; plenty of fitness for this hike. There are several choices of views; you can look up at the sign or down on it from above. I recommend both. We went above the sign first and enjoyed a surprisingly nice view despite some smog. On descent, we chose to sojourn to the ""look up"" view. It cost an additional 30 minutes and was easy walking. Total time was 3 hours with stops for pictures, drinking water and just looking around. While your there, visit the ""Bat Cave"" too! It's near the trail head",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJ5O
50,Get really close to the sign,The locals don't like it and have had it removed from Google etc. They have hand written signs saying tourist keep out private property etc. Just ignore them. Just put in your sat nav DERONDA DRIVE and the route takes you to the top of hill behind the sign. The locals will hate you. Just be nice and park considerately. My teenage boys walked the route from Griffith's observatory and I picked them up at the top of the hill after they completed their 90 minute hike up the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billyb246

Our AirBnB host suggested to drive up to Lake Hollywood for an up close view and we were very pleased with the recommendation. We travelled up there on a Sunday morning around 10am. Traffic was rather light and not a lot of tourist yet. We Found the venue the best for some really fun photos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Changjo88
40,You can see it while driving,They have trails that get you close but not real close. If you ride around they have a lot of places to get a good picture of the sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannynla2001
50,"It's Not Just a Sign ~ ""Hollywood"" Represents Many Things to Millions of People","Photos with the Hollywood Sign, erected in 1923, in the background seems to be on everyone's Bucket List, like the iconic ""Welcome to Los Angeles"" Sign.It has been modified & rebuilt through the years. In 2010 a successful fundraiser hosted by Hugh Hefner enabled construction of a new sign, which now stands 45' high & 450' long.The purchase of the 138 acres behind the sign formerly owned by Howard Hughes ensured that it will be kept as parkland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanEvan
40,Essential Part of The 'Hollywood Experience',"The famous Hollywood sign is an icon of this area that is symbol of 'glamour' but like most things in movies not all what it seems.Yes it is a must do photographic opportunity, but the sign was not to promote movies but to promote a real estate development in 1923.The sign can be seen from many locations around Hollywood suburb but a viewing platform with clear views is built in the Hollywood & Highgate Shopping Centre on Hollywood Boulevard next to Dolby Theatre.One little known but in my opinion best spots to see the sign and take photographs , without the crowds is right at top Canyon Drive after a short walk up a little used dirt service road.It is easy to miss this service road has it has a locked gate across it but the bonus of walking up the rocky road is some REAL television and movie history.The sign is viewed from what is essentially an old rock quarry, most times it will be just you and few friends, however this quarry is not just a quarry!!!The cave you will first see on reach the top of the road and the left hand bend is the original BatCave from 1960's TV series starring Adam West.Walk through this 'Cave' it is actually a man made tunnel and come out into the set of the first Star Wars movie location. This area was also used for the Lone Rangers television series.Oh and you get fabulous pictures of The Hollywood sign.You can hike up to the sign, a very very long walk but be aware there are private property around or near it and if viewing from any were at night did you see the ghost of Peg Entwistle, an Actress who committed suicide in 1932 by jumping off the Letter 'H'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewieTraveller
30,Its Just a sign,I really wouldn't call this a Tourist Attraction more like just a place to see. but drive yourself. Much easier and more Fun,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdbdlb2018
50,Very nice to see!,I have traveled to and through LA many times over the years but never had a chance to stop and see or actually go anywhere near the Hollywood sign until recently. It was a wonderful experience and a great scenic drive to get to the area. Thank you LA for keeping this up and looking so good! Was icing on the cake for this wonderful LA trip we all had. We will return again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincentm500
30,Interesting,"Interesting experience to see this iconic sign but, just remember its just a sign. Absolutely amazing how far you can see this sign. Do not try to get in touching distance of the sign or near the fence as you will be arrested. Griffin Park is the best place to get great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henrysm
50,Must see,If u go see this don't biker Hiking up go and see it from theView of the original batcave :) a must see whilst inHollywood. We did it during la bike tours which was anAwesome use.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wren76
30,Distant Icon,"You can't go to LA/Hollywood and not see the sign. unfortunately, you will not get very close. Still worth doing. There are many ways to see it, Griffith Observatory will be the best if on foot/car. I would have loved to do the horseback riding trip, but my youngest is a few months shy of the minimum age.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LelahK
50,Good climb . Good views,A bit of a mission to find the location to start the hike from but once it's found it's well worth it. Amazing views from the top,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TahirS188
40,Get off of the normal tourist routes for the best views of the sign,Done a private tour to get the best views and learnt about the history of Hollywoodland and how it all came about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyg681
40,Awesome views,If you want to see the sign go to the Griffith Observatory. Amazing views with other things to see. Parking is super cheap and can take hours seeing the observatory and hiking the trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simplythetruth21
30,Not as awesome as I'd imagined,"We drove up to the observation area, but didn't get out as it was late and we needed to get on our way. There is a great view from the road, but you can't take pictures with anyone in them without parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeremyntaylor
40,can't get close...,about 1/2 mile is as close as you'll get... so take a gander at it from sunset or hollywood blvd and keep a moving!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162andys
30,Too far away,Unfortunately you cannot get up close to the sign. last time we were there we stood right beside it for photographs. Still an icon for Los Angeles,
50,Closer than Griffith Conservatory,Lake Hollywood Park is all you need to know! Your view will be closer than the Griffith Conservatory. There is a Youtube video of a lady with long brown hair that explains the difficulties of getting to the sign but explains how to get here. We decided to take her advice and I'm glad we did. Lake Hollywood Park is a free parking area along the road that will not make the neighbors mad. We keyed in the address to our navigation and still got turned around a couple times but we finally made it and the view was great. Make sure you can see the park (green grass area) before you park otherwise you'll have a bit of a walk to see it.,
50,Nice hike and view of the hills,I thought this would be an underwhelming visit but truly enjoyed the scenery and view of the hills. Would take time for a hike as well as the photo opportunities. Doing,
50,"Up the winding road, to the sign!","This was not easy to find, but we took many twists and turns to get that perfect picture for our son! Iconic, and just fun!!",
50,Surreal,"If you want the best view of the Hollywood sign, call Glitteratti tours and have them take you there. They got us closer than anyone else did !! It's fabulous !!!",
30,Mother & adult daughter trip,A must visit when in LA. We were fortunate to visit on a clear day with great views. Apparently it is often smoggy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandravW6496AL
50,"Great ride, fun with the sign","Awesome trip up mountain, and perfect place to see sign.my brother took us up he is a tour quote for star tours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leighm155
50,A Must See in L.A.,Saw the Hollywood Sign from our Loews Hollywood Hotel room and also went up to Griffith Observatory to see as well. Family enjoyed seeing it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coreye799
30,Hard to find,There is no access to sign so all you do is run around it and try to find a way for a perfect photo on your own. No direction no nothing. We went to Griffin opservatorium and tried to reach sign from there with no success. We walked for 2 hours in one direction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maja_ul
50,Long weekend plan,"I have seen this sign in many Hollywood movies, and here I am to witness it live. Superb location, awesome view. Enjoyed the sunset view there. You can see the attached pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/604rajeshb
30,It is a sign at the end of the day.,"If you go to L.A. you have see the iconic Hollywood sign. Various places to view, Mulholland Drive has a viewing point that we found. You can see the sign clearly but at the end of the day it is a sign.",
40,hollywood sign hike let down,the hike to top of sign is grueling but the view is amazing do not waste money with a guide there r no secret trails u take the same as everyone else the sign is backwards and not great photo op griffith park is free with greater photos on max zoom love LA enjoy.,
10,It's only a sign.,There is nothing more to say. This is a wooden man made sign. Why would you spend time and money to see it.,
40,Hooray for Hollywood,"The best place/closest we found to see the famous sign was at the Griffith Observatory. If you are there before noon the parking is free. You can't walk right up to it, but you can get a great picture of the sign & the Hollywood Hills.",
40,Hollywood!,Disappointed that we weren't able to take the hike to the sign. It was getting close to dark and the hike is a little farther than we were told! But seeing it from the observatory was still terrific!,
40,Saw it!,"Cool view from Walk of Fame. Never got any closer. We were told we couldn't walk up to sign so we were content to just take a picture. Not sure what other options there were for closer views. Still, it's an iconic tourist destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dozmond
30,Couldn't leave LA without seeing,Couldn't leave the LA area without seeing the Hollywood sign. Saw it. Never have to see it again. üôÉ,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3cntrygrls
50,Griffith Park and the Hollywood Sign,"Three middle-aged fun girlfriends took the four mile, 40 flights of stairs(according to the app) hiking tour. It was a lot of fun. Lisa, our tour-guided was very informative and knew a lot of little extras. We went through a street of La Feliz and up a secret staircase and then on to the Observatory. I recommend this highly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurlj
40,Worth a visit!,It can be hard to see the Hollywood sign close up but the best place we found it to be seen was at Canyon Lake Drive. Yes it's just huge metal letters but it's got to be seen while visiting Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samantharhodes85
30,It's just a sign!!!,"It's just a sign that's it, nothing else, but knowing that you still have to have a look and take a picture it's one of those sights you have to tick off and say I have seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O491CUjasons
20,DO not waste your time,We wanted to see the Hollywood sign so we drove through bumper to bumper traffic for 45 minutes to get to the park. Once we got there there was so much traffic and police telling you where to drive it was complete confusion. There was not parking available and we pulled off in a loading zone to at least get out and see the sign and take a photo. It was so far away on another hill that you could barely see it. Do not waste your time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prof002
30,Its a sign is that 10 characters,It's a sign. We took our pics along Hollywood Boulevard so it was an easy vacation picture. No need to pay for this,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaddleWarrior
40,Great View,"Nice long drive into the hills to this hilltop site where the view is unique. Can get very close to the sign for photos/selfies. Bring tourist standards: water, camera/video, good walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5167KAkims
50,Awesome!,You got to see it to feel it! Can be viewed from most parts or can book a tour way up close to the sign. Either way it is a wow factor.Dream come true! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/munira21
30,Hazy.,Need long distance lense. Perhaps it could with a coat of paint. Beware if costume folk dragging you in to have a photo it could cost you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/151margarets
30,Another ideal a bit crushed,It's not as amazing as we expected. Everything around LA is a bit dusty disappointing and sad. It was reality hitting and ideal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silurica
50,Fun to hike up to,"From Griffith Park Observatory, you can actually hike to the Hollywood sign (well, behind/above it, anyway). There's a clear path leading up the hill, away from the observatory, and if you basically keep going left--towards the sign--you'll get there. Definitely take water with you, since there are no facilities near the sign, and be sure to wear sunscreen. Even all the wonderful LA smog can't keep out the sun.I'm not sure the mileage, or the ""average time"", but I'd say give yourself an hour to get there from the observatory if you're not speed walking or jogging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittany_11_10
30,Too Far Away !,"So we travelled up to Griffith Observatory early on a saturday morning to see the sign. It is iconic, so no trip can not include this trip.The queues were horrendous at 10am, and parking well it was a miracle but we actually were in the right place at the right time as someone pulled out and we took their spot.The sign is far in the distance, much further away than I expected.Yes we have our selfie, of the sign with a massive phone mast next to it (nicely chopped out on professional pics).Still, pleased we went, just be prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsACM
50,It's Iconic!,"It is a sight that pretty much every person has seen in pictures or movies, and to see it in person is pretty neat. We did not hike near or to the sign, but to get some great pictures was enough for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metsfan2017
40,Just for the picture,"It's a very cliche picture, but i wanted anyway. you go through a nice neighbor in a very tight street (only one car) to get a nice picture of the sign. I did because, you know, its a classic picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pitpassi
50,Can you miss it?!,"Piece of history that you can see from all over LA, can also take a tour so you can get up close and personal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeSaCRAE
30,Just for the selfie,Iconic picture from L.A. sawn in so many movies Just good for a souvenir picture nothing elseLocated on the hill of Hollywood you can take a good shot from Hollywood blvd,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
40,Good ol' Hollywood Sign,I recommend the Hollywood sign to anyone visiting. Since I worked right by the Hollywood sign I discovered there are many ways to get to the sign. You can either find it going up Beachwood Drive and making a left onto Ledgewod I believe that's the street or you can find it going up Hollywood Lake Drive off Barham. Many tourists have a hard time finding it by foot. I recommend driving unless you are ready for a good workout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNicoleS375
50,A accidental Tourist Site,The original sign was part of a Real estate deal in the 1920'S land boom of LA. It was spelled out HOLYWOODLAND. But as time went by the sign began to fall apart.Then Hugh Hefner of Playboy fame led a fundraiser and restored it. Anyways it really hard to get up there especially during the fire season. But it does have a grteat view if you nake the effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
40,Iconic,"This is a pretty good hike to the sign. Be sure to read carefully how to get there. Residents have successfully petitioned to have certain routes closed and parking is tricky to say the least. However, it's well worth the hike. The views at the sign are spectacular. Pack a little snack to eat while there and to provide sustenance for the hike back. It can get a little strenuous since it's an uphill hike, so not for the faint hearted. Take plenty of water especially on a hot day. There are no water or toilet facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chk1
50,Must see place!,"This a must when you go to LA. Beautiful views of the city. Great place to get some exercise done, do picnics, walk, explore.. just great!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauramjimenez
40,Cool but not necessary,It's worth dropping by and viewing it once in your life. However I would t bother going their unless you have other things to do. Lots of other visitors and you get a great view of the sign from the highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qajaqrolls
30,Small bit of history,I enjoy the history about the sign. Otherwise it's a tourist spot and not too exciting. The hike is okay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyAndrew
50,A must see and place for lots of selfies :-),It's fun to drive up the narrow streets with all its beautiful houses. You can't drive all the way but have to park the car and walk for approx. 10 minutes until you come to spot where you have a great. Ire of the sign and The skyscrapers of LA in the distance. It prohibited to walk all the way up to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2009anders
50,Awesome,"Really good, everyone must take a picture there. GTA V feelings. Even with the cloudy day, this was such an awesome attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jos_arturm2017
50,Loved this trip with uber driver who has never been there!!!,Loved this trip with uber driver who has never been there!!! The driver didn't know where he was going but we asked for directions and managed to get there in the end!,
50,Must see,"Have been here again with the family, and I can only say that you have to have seen this at least once in your life. I have had 3 occasions in my life and I still think it's impressive. Best spot to see this sign if from the park (and a little upwards walk from the park) at 3155 Canyon Lake Drive. Also, go early in peak season as after 10:00 am it gets very busy. We arrived at 8:45 am and there was hardly anyone there. The day before we tried at around 11:30 am and we couldn't find a place to park and the park rangers were making it impossible to park anywhere else. So go early, take your time to take pictures and you will have the best view and the best pictures.",
30,"No, You Can't Touch the Sign","Hiking up to the sign is, of course, a must. It's like the Statue of Liberty for the East Coast. Good luck finding parking. Hardly possible. Also, you can't go touch the sign. The hike isn't all that bad thankfully.",
50,An adventure,"Was a challenge for us to find the sign. Took Hollywood Blvd to canyon drive. Drove through most likely stars homes! The street was narrow, but when we reached the top of the canyon view was amazing! Note: do not attempt in a passenger Van!",
50,Bucket list check!,We took a tour of Los Angeles and this was one of the stops. Had our picture made and then we were done. I couldn't come home without that picture. That's about all there is to say.,
30,Good for photographs. No provision for parking.,If you plan to reach near the Sign and have a vehicle you will find it difficult to park because of no parking zones/areas near the Sign. Also instead of going near to the Sign which is basically a no tress passing zone. you can go further towards the Hollywood sign spot and the Hollywood lake park to have better view and photographs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dev_undone
50,Amazing View,An enjoyable hike up to one of the most iconic sights in America. I've seen photos of the sign since I was little and finally had a chance to see it up close. Well worth the hike!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andybayridge
50,Iconic Hollywood,"Opt outside! Getting outside in LA is what the city is all about. I recommend parking and walking around lake Hollywood , after you walk drive up as close as you can and take pictures. There is a park where you can get great pics of the sign just above the lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJM
40,Iconic,Of course you have to sed the Hollywood sign when you come to LA. The hike up is not bad if you can ever find parking. Go early if your looking for street parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
40,Worth a quick visit,"A must see for everyone visiting LA. Best place to see it & take pictures from, without upsetting the residents, is to go to Lake Hollywood Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchpetra
40,Wish they would light it up at night!,We saw the sign multiple times during our stay in LA. At night the view of the city from Griffith Park Observatory is gorgeous! I wish they would light up the sign at night so you could see it in the evening. Even just a few hours would be great! Of course seeing this iconic sign is amazing during the day as well!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferJ45150
50,Love the View and Background. Great for Photo Opportunities,"This location is one of the most interesting spots in America. It is the icon and symbol of entertainment for enthusiasts around the world. Additionally, you have a fantastic view of the city from above. I would recommend this place when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayamax
40,A legend in LA- The Hollywood sign!,"I've always been enamored with this piece of cultural history. A great way to see it? Head to the Hollywood and Highland complex.(Ample parking there) Or even better take LYFT. You can take great pics from a giant couch and pretend to be a star with the glorious sign in the background. It's right next to a California Pizza Kitchen (I'm a sucker for their food- I like the thin crusts and their salads). When you are there you are steps from seeing the Walk of Stars, Mann's Chinese Theater (where people like Frank Sinatra and Marlyn Monroe placed their footprints in cement at the height of their prime). Get ready for seeing a bit of everything here. People in fake super hero costumes asking for money for pics with them, stylish fashionistas, loads of tourists, etc.This area is a cornucopia of variety and some great fun people watching everywhere up and down the block. Get ready for some heavy traffic getting there (depending on when you are going) but otherwise a great place to go.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89dustinf
40,View from afar,"Since you don't want to be carted off by the park police for trespassing, view the sign from the corner of Hollywood Blvd and Hollywood Avenue. Go to the mall on the corner and there are viewing glasses there. Imagine you're back on the Sunset Strip with James Dean and Marylin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/217kerris
30,View of the Sign,Rather than trying to drive to the Hollywood sign- where it's hard to get good photo. Park at the Dolby theater and you can get a great photo of you or your party with the sign in the background. Have a bite or a drink while people watching . The Dolby theater is the home of the academy awards- for those film buffs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pamela88808
50,Hollywood Hollywood Sign,"The Hollywood Sign is a landmark. The first place I stay was in Hollywood. When I see the sign, I feel home. I feel there is no need to visit the site. View it from distance, its impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsF8241KC

50,Rent a car and ger lost,"...or get an uber...We drove around and around this twisty road leading close to the sign. It was fun seeing the beautiful houses and seeing the sign from different angles. We ultimately ended up on a road that at the bottom had a little park and simply the best views of the sign and opposite, downtown LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickAlixMom
50,Hollywood sign up close!,"We found directions on line( basically put Lake hollywood in your waze/gps and it will take you there) it's free, you can take dozens of pics and the view to the lake is also wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdhaune
50,The best symbol of Los Angeles,When a tourist from anywhere in the world thinks of visiting Los Angeles the first thing in mind is the Hollywood sign. This is the symbol of the movie stars glamour of yesteryears.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753vladyc
30,NO TOUR BUS GOES ANYWHERE NEAR IT,"Had always marveled at being fairly close and taking an iconic picture in front of the famous sign but found that none of the hop on hop off buses go there or in fact anywhere near it,your better off going to one of the malls near the Chinese theatre and taking a picture from there. we ended up paying $30 for one of the vendor to take a superimposed photo which looked pretty good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famousactor
30,If you like crowds...this is for you,"It's iconic, it's the only one of its kind, and it's extremely crowded because of those points. Sure, you can hardly visit the LA area without getting a glimpse of the sign, and any of the top-rated tour groups will take you there, but the closest you can get is an observation platform which is up a good number of steep stone steps, and you'll likely have to dodge hordes of people stopping in the steps to take ridiculous selfies. There is an area where you can take amazing pictures of the valley below, but be advised that there is extremely limited parking (10-15 spaces, maybe) and the tiny parking area is packed with tour buses. It's neat to say you've done it, but you might be better off just snapping a picture with a good zoom lens from down in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristyg974
40,Hollywood Sign,Great view of the Hollywood sign from lake Hollywood Park. A must see. Very narrow roads going up and down on the roads.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/721TR
30,No illumination at night,"Do not make that mistake- plan to see it during the daylight as it does not have illumination at night. Technically about a mile from the Hollywood boulevard with all the stars on the pavement. Go see the sign, then stars, if you risk ending up at dusk. Canyon Lake drive is good street to to view it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ksksksksks
40,Not the sign but the area,The area surrounding was so beautiful and we took pictures from around that area. It is nearly impossible and restricted to reach close to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nidaleo
50,A Favorite Hike,The hike to the Hollywood sign is great for out of towers and locals alike. Parking along Beachwood has been going through some changes so make sure you go online for the recent updates. The hike isn't very strenuous with an elevation of about 500 feet. A few years ago the old path that was made up of cracked and uneven pavement but it was flattened and replaced making for a very even surface. If you're traveling with someone who can't make the full hike they can stop about halfway up the incline for a lower view of the sign. To climb to the top takes up up and behind the sign for some amazing views and photo ops.,
50,If in la have to see this,"Absolutely fab place , Holly wood sign is must visit place you get lot of tours from there Beverly Hills , rodeo drive just 10 min always . Great place to be in .",
30,Iconic Sign,"Interesting, very interesting, not amazing just a sign on a hillside that everyone's seen. It's just a sign",
40,An interesting experience,"I read that it is not possible to get near the Hollywood sign by car. It is true. However, you can either drive through Bel Air and find small upward roads which are by itself an experience. It should take you 15 minutes driving up from sunset Blvd. You'll see a gorgeous view of L.A. at the end of Mulholland drive at the park located in 3399 Deronda Dr, Los Angeles. You may hike towards the top but I wonder whether it is worth it. You may find good spots for pictures at the park. Also, be aware that there is no parking between 8am and 6pm, so start driving at 545pm to find a good spot to park up there.",
30,It is icon,Great place to hike but sign has only beauty in being icon.? Not worthy a visit if you have less than 5 days in LA area,
50,What a view,"My daughter and I visited Lake Hollywood Park to see the sign. Absolutely amazing. You can hike up to see it if your fit and/or into that kind of thing. We were on a time crunch so we took an Uber up, asked him to wait for us and he was kind enough to do so. We snapped our picks and then Uber'd down. The lazy way? Yes it was but like I said we were on a serious time limit so it worked perfect for us. The view was amazing from this park. Love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pearl2483
20,Jilted!!!,"So, we follow the directions that come up first on Google when trying to find the beat way to view the Hollywood sign. The directions take us meandering through various neighborhoods and we feel like we are actually getting pretty close, except at the end of the directions, we end up at a metal fence that doesn't allow us to keep following the directions.... So, we end up at the Griffith Observatory and get to view the sign from miles and miles away. Very disappointing...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdventurerRich
40,Fun to see the sign!,Griffith park is a nice place to spend a few hours; the Observatory was extremely crowded on a summer day but what we saw was very interesting; Nice spot for photos of the sign and views of downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachrats2013
50,Must see cheesy tourist activity.,"Who goes to Hollywood and doesn't get their picture taken in front of the sign. May be cheesy, but it's a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356worldtraveler
30,"Ok , I've seen it!","Sure I have seen it a million times on TV and thought wow that is amazing. Unless you have plenty of time to waste in LA you will see the best view of it from Hollywood Boulavard on the second level near the Dolby Theatre and well, it's there and now i've seen it! Good photo ops from this vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tincoll
50,It was ok,Not as exciting as it sounds but the walk was good the day we jay so the Vickie was not as clear as we hoped,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/batyaj
50,Magnificent,We took the option of a private tour that takes you in the residential roads across the valley which is as close as you can get without a hike and closer than the minibuses can get. It's just what you expect and is an icon I'd recommend it 100%,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayWestYorks
40,You cant get too close,"Driving through the Hollywood Hills to get the best vantage point to take a photo. As you get closer, security guards were actually on the roads turning people around and stopping them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellefC2285KZ
50,Worth the hike!,"Underwhelming from a distance, good views from Griffiths Observatory, but I'd recommend hiking it for the best views of the sign and LA!Hiking routes can easily be found on YouTube. Can also be accessed via public transport - we took the DASH from Hollywood/Vine station to Beachwood Canyon/Westshire Dr, then walked up Ledgewood Dr, Mulholland Hwy and finally Mt Lee Drive to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJohno_14
10,Dot on the landscape,"You can see it from downtown but would need a good lens to get a good photo. most tours do not take you very near, although they say they do. It is iconic but out of the way and not much to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K7668APandrewm
40,Plenty of running routes,Get there early to make use of the free parking. Quite easily notched up >25km in distance ticking off the peaks and heading to the Hollywood sign. Some good climbs I ended up with ~1000m.Keep an eye on the map as its not too difficult to head way off course!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzd31155
50,Best place to see sign!,Go to the Denny's on Sunset Blvd. across from the Netflix HQ! Great spot and you don't have to deal with the traffic up to the observatory!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/591debl
50,Gotta see it,You can't go to Hollywood and not see the sign. It's a fun drive thru neat neighborhoods too. There are several viewing spots but we really liked the dog park best!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tborntreger
40,Got to be done!,"There are roads leading up closer to the sign, however no actual signs directing you, so you've got to go left and right until you get closer! We managed it... There are signs saying road closed ahead, Private> However this is not by law and just purchased by the community, I learnt this after we went so were pretty annoyed about this. Still great view",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nick7KoP
50,Don't miss it,If you travel to LA you have to get up to the sign. Check the best address on YouTube . Don't mind where some streets say do not enter. You need to park your car and walk into the park near the sign and get the obligatory picture,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Howdidodi
40,Why pay,"There is no need to hike or pay to see this sign. There are many areas in the city that this sign can be seen from for no charge. That being said, catch a snapshot for your memories and move on to something else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464tyrah
50,It was one of the two places my husband want to see while we were in LA.,Carlos our guide knew a remote trail that got us a great view of the sign. No crowds. Great picture ops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Realty56
40,See the sign from the Griffith Observatory,There are many places in Hollywood that provide a view of the Hollywood sign however one of our favourites is at the Griffith Observatory. Not only is there a great view of the sign you also get great views of LA with the option of exploring the observatory too. Great way to cover a couple of must do items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormLWat
40,a classic,The views are breath taking and all the trails make for lots of fun getting the perfect picture! a must see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514melissat
40,Worth seeing but not overly stunning,The Hollywood sign is incredibly iconic but its not worth spending loads of time trying to view it as its hard to get very close to.The best place to view from a distance is downtown Hollywood and the best place to get up close is in Griffith Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
50,Hollywood,Hollywood is good place to walk.we can understand about american arts.we are having a good time there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suhart0n0g
30,Nice not exciting,Nice to see and I guess a must do. Not overly exciting and quite small. We saw from street level. You can't get close or not easily at any rate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryf232
50,Relaxing,There are too many things to do in Los Angeles metro areas!but this one was a very amazing day!I went for a walked wait for the sunset it was beautiful experience more then what I was expecting.i organized my day went for a wonderful long walk day I had so much fun very relaxing ....park at griffin observatory .snd walk to the Hollywood sing I love it.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169nrr
30,I know the secret,We had heard a lot about hiking to the sign. Save your time and just drive to it instead of a long hike with limited views. To get to a great spot to view (literally 0.1 mile away) take Beachwood Canyon drive up from Franklin Ave. Next take Ledgewood Dr and then Rockcliff. Amazing views but not much parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2099SWpatrickw
40,"Yup, it's the famous sign.","While not terribly exciting, this is an iconic sign, that can be seen from numerous spots in town.While we did not get too close to the sign, we had plenty of angles for some photo-ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheShis
40,"Close, but not that close","We saw the Hollywood sign from a distance, from Griffith's Park Observatory. I'm not sure if anyone can get close to it, but we certainly didn't see any trekkers. If I were you, I would Uber to GP and look round the Observatory; get in pics of the Hollywood sign and then order another Uber to take you away. The road up is very steep, the Park guards do not let anyone park for more than 5 minutes at the top and parking all the way down the hill is very limited and absolutely chockers. Waste of time going on a bus trip, as we only had a few minutes....and I had wanted to visit the Observatory...no chance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
50,Hollywood sign - best place for photos,"If you want to get an epic shot of the Hollywood sign, be sure to drive Mullholland Hwy up to the Photo Spot. Its a bit of a drive, but lovely all the same. Some of the streets though can be quite narrow, so be careful if you are an overseas driver (like we were).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParadiseW2017
30,Plenty of opportunities to view,"As previous comments states, you can't get close to the sign which is unfortunate. However if visiting Hollywood there are many opportunities to see the sign from a distance.A good photo opportunity but end of the day it's just a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashbobs1211
40,Far from a distance,We went up to Griffith observatory and look at the sign from a distance. It seems like you need to walk up the trail and take photo from there. The weather is overcast and we hardly can view the sign clearly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffrey_Teh_2000
30,Sadly a declining site - but still present,"I used to go to the top of the adjacent hills to see the sign, it was pretty impressive. Now, it still looks nice, but not impressive or clean looking. Actually, it looks small, tired and dirty. A sad reminder of something of promise, but now more superficial and outdated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FaitheTraveller
30,Must see,Difficult to find up close but best seen at a distance. Iconic sign from real estate development origination of Hollywoodland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anagorski
30,It's real,You cannot visit Hollywood without seeing the Hollywood sign! The sign can be seen from miles away and from muitlple roadways.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheliaS658
50,A must see,"There is a number of tours up the view point, but I actually took a walk up there, might not be the greatest idea on a very hot day or if you're just not a big fan of strolls. From the view point there's a short trail that gets you just behind the sign itself. Both places are great for photos. Really worth the hike, kinda iconic place and a must see when you're in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
50,Got to see it,What can I say. Got to see it. On the day we went to Burbank to WB studios we had lunch at Bobs Big Boy in Burbank. and the Waze GPS app found a city park to get a good view and good picture spot if the sign. Then we went on to the Griffith observatory for a great view of the town. It was a quick trip back to Hollywood Blvd from there. A true trip into Americana,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottt456
50,Bucket list,We did a hike until the Hollywood Sign which took us about 4 hours (round trip) but it was really impressive to see from so close! A dream come true and a must that I can check on my bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vvpprr
50,Must do,Drive to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive for a great view of the sign. Iconic view and not tricky to get to. Free parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wombling_Free_7548
40,It's The Hollywood Sign! Get Your Camera Out!,"We saw the sign from a couple of locations during our stay - from the Hollywood & Highland Shopping Mall and from Griffith Observatory - and we couldn't help being mesmerized by it. It's something we've seen countless times on TV or in the movies and, being from the UK, something we never thought we'd see in person.We took countless photos trying to get a decent picture but it was well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
50,Vacation with teenage grandsons,"This VERY popular place has high vehicular count, limited (or distant) parking, strict police controls. But ... it was easy to dive to the top and back. If you were lucky enough to grab a parking spot, you might get a fun photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kek604
50,Must see!,"As we were driving into Hollywood, I asked my friend, ""wonder when we'll see the Hollywood sign..."" literally 5 seconds later there it was! Loved it! We took a bus tour and got a closer glimpse. It's awesome and a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaSalinas
40,Must do when in L.A.,"We started out at Griffith Observatory to get a view of the sign. We decided that although we got a few decent shots of the sign, we wanted to be closer. After finding some directions online, we took a trip through a residential area for a fabulous view! Just make sure when you park, to park legally and be respectful of the homeowners. Blocking driveways is not nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamihayes95
50,Don't get discouraged by the signs,"My friends and I hiked up to the Hollywood sign and along the way, we passed by many signs that said road closed or no trespassing. don't listen to the signs as we were told that the residents of the hills put those up to discourage the tourists. other than this, the hike is fairly easy. good view of LA from the top",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvo_kid
50,Iconic,The best way to see the Hollywood sign in my opinion is to take the 6mile round hike up behind it to see the stunning views of LA. Hard work going up but a great workout & the view is so worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lozzy91
40,Sign,"To tell you the truth I didn't go to the sign, however we took a tour from Hollywood to Beverly Hills.And went to a very good spot, kind of observation point.Good perks from that, you actually will see the sign as close as possible and you will have such a beautiful view of LA from the top.The tour price was $15 or $20 and it lasts around two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriabR6368IO
50,Enjoy but be respectful,"The iconic Hollywood sign is a must see while in LA. You can do a great hike up there and enjoy amazing views. However, everyone visiting should be aware that people live up here. Parking on the streets in front of houses and clogging the narrow roads is rude and should not be done. I cannot imagine how incredibly frustrating this is. Moreover, we are guests when we visit and should treat their neighborhood with respect. There are no smoking signs everywhere due to the drought and how dangerous it would be if that hill caught ok fire. If you are going to visit, please do and enjoy but also please respect the surroundings and the people who live here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrickelyPear
30,Beautiful Views,"I am not an outdoorsy lady, so GP wasn't exactly a treat, but I could appreciate it, however the Hollywood sign is adjacent the park, so that was a tad confusing. Parks are always hot and uncomfortable during the summer months, so they need more vendors present!Maybe a fruit stand?Lemonade stand?Umbrellas for shade?A place to relax and take the views in?Water is almost $5 so make sure you have your own and lots of it! Parking on the hills are also a few dollars as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kentaraj
10,Bring binoculars,You can't get close enough to actually get a good pic and all in all disappointing.You stand on a balcony to take a picture and can see white in the back ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolemY1985VL
40,Just like the movies,I had some friends in town so i thought i would finally go up and show them this sign that emulates LA. We had to go to the dog park near the sign though for decent photos what they dont tell you is you cant actually touch them like everyone thinks thats the only reason why it lost a star. Apart fromt that the drive is cool to see all the hollywood houses and area def worth checking out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tobyk441
30,Overrated,"Never again will I go out of my way to get a picture of this sign. While it's incredibly iconic, you get enough of the pizzazz by just driving by and looking at it through your window. It's almost impossible to get to the sign unless you hike to it and the Griffith Observatory is the best way to see it if you don't want to hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katier942
20,Holiday,The only reason I rated it poor was that you can not get anywhere near it unless you home up the hill,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perrycj
30,"Been there, done that, next...","The Hollywood sign is an iconic bucket list item that's worth the trip if you're in LA. That being said, it's a busy area, so plan for some crowds. You can get up to sign by hiking or horseback.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyl552
40,"See the sign , take a photo , look out to LA...","That's all there is to the outing but it is such an iconic thing , it is a must do. As expected view was comprised with smog but you got a sense of how big LA really is.We took an Uber up to the entrance to the park. It is gated and I am guessing not open at all hours. Local residents must go crazy with all these tourists clogging their streets !Stayed up there exploring a little for maybe 20 minutes then made our way down the hills a little to get mobile phone coverage again to book Uber back to hotelKids loved it as they also got to climb some dirt hills / mounds and explore some trails in the park.People looked like they walked most of the way up. Roads are narrow and windy so not sure if tour buses go up that far.A quick thing to do if taking an Uber , cost was $12 US round trip.",
40,Must see in LA,"This is another must see in LA. These 42 foot letters are huge on the hillside. To get close to the sign, you have to drive up the hillside and park alongside the road and take pictures of it in the distance. Our tour guide said that access is limited and kept secret due to vandalism. As we drove around LA, we saw it many times. It is not lit up at night, so make sure to catch it in the day. It is a sign on a hill - it is what it is......",
40,We finally arrived,Letters are actually bigger than you think.Can be windy up there.Originally the sign was put there as an advertisement to sell real estate.It originally read Hollywood land but the land word fell down and later on some l.a. rich people paid to update the sign and left it just as Hollywood.Doing a tour from the main drag is a great way to see it and the surrounding area.,
50,MUST DO,"This is a huge attraction, we got up at 6am to hike up and it took around 2 hours including photos and relaxation at the top. Would do this every weekend if I could, a great workout for fitness folks.",
30,It am what it is,"You've seen the sign in magazines, on television, in movies, and maybe thought ""Gee, I'd like to see that in person."" Well, I have seen it in person and I have to say I was underwhelmed. Maybe it was because I was seeing it at a distance, maybe it was because I had seen it so much in the media that I was expecting more...I don't know but it didn't do that much for me. I always imagined that the sign loomed right over Hollywood Boulevard--wrong! Admittedly I was looking at it from a distance (my hotel and from one of the overlooks in Hollywood Hills) and maybe, just maybe, I should have made an effort to get much closer, but I didn't. If you're in Hollywood and look north you can't miss it, and perhaps your reaction will be different.",
50,A Must See!,We were able to get great views of the sign from the Griffith Observatory. This was our first trip to LA and we definitely wanted to see the sign given it is so iconic. It was a great experience not to mention that the views were amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ATXGirlie
50,Absolutely Stunning,We didn't take this drive on our last trip and it is well worth the price of admission (free). It was a great drive up in the mountains and once we arrived it didn't disappoint. The Hollywood Park sits right at the base of the Hollywood sign and the view is magnificent. Parking is free as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BReal549
30,Views of LA if no smog,In my opinion I feel like this a must when visiting LA because this is one of the things you associate LA with. The observatory was closed when we went which was a Monday. You can still view the scenery with the observatory being closed. Smog was a little bit of an issue while we were visiting. We didn't spend a lot of time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chubee01
50,Hollywood Sign!,The Hollywood sign has many uses!I routinely use it to indicate where I am in LA. I am here temporarily and it has saved me from getting lost.The drive to the sign is beautiful!Right below the sign is a wonderful dog park.I had the fascinating experience one day of waiting down the block in front of the hill the sign is on and saw something out of the corner of my eye near my car door....I looked up there was a pack of wild coyotes!!! Never let your dog off leash around there.But I definitely recommend the drive up there....quite a lovely break from regular old LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D8184LLdianef
50,Aerial Views!,"We took a helicopter tour of LA and saw the Hollywood sign from there. We've seen it before from the ground, but the aerial view is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/502jamiej
50,You have to see it,I was able to get a picture from Hollywood Blvd and The Griffin Observatory.It's a historic sign and a symbol of LA. You can see it from all ocer the city but Griffin Park and Hollywood Blvd has the best views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melisx33
50,Worth The Hike!,"My husband & I followed the viral video that explained to us how to hike to behind the Hollywood Sign. I would HIGHLY recommend searching for that video!We parked on the steep hill at Lake Hollywood Park. This is where everrrryyyyyone takes their pictures AND this was the closest parking spot we could find. We continued and hiked through the tiny streets of Beachwood Canyon and up the road to the Hollywood Sign! Even Beachwood Canyon was great to hike through, it's an adorable little town.It is a pretty steep hike. But, the view (and the cool breeze) when you get to the top, is SO worth it. It was absolutely stunning, I could have stayed up there for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveriot1023
30,Hollywood's sign,Covered this by doing the short day trip tour of Hollywood where the the car takes you around Hollywood places to see in about two hours.You need to bargain with the tour operators who start off with $50 per person and come down to $15-25 . Bargain hard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yogeshjw
30,Iconic place,To see the Iconic sign is a must see visit in L.A. The trail to walk up hill is a good 2-3 miles and one must bee in good shape to reach the top. Good hike of 1-2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneP788
30,Historic landmark.,I was looking forward to seeing the historic Hollywood landmark.I was a little disappointed that I couldn't get close enough to take a good photo.The best view is probably from the Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christhursfield
40,Hollywood here I come,"The Hollywood signs are one of the most famous landmarks in Hollywood, Los Angeles and ery well known in the whole world. The original sign was longer and spelled out Hollywood land and it's purpose was to advertise the name of the land that was for sale. The characters have a height of appr. 50 feet and were placed in 1923. There are several hiking routes to this sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArieDiepen
40,From Griffith observatory,"Saw it from Griffith observatory with some zoom tried to get a slightly better pic , not sure what happen when it's foggy .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saurabhrangoli
40,Be careful where you visit it,We asked our reception in the hotel where to get the best photo opportunity and was told mulholland drive. We put this in the sat nav which took us to a dead end right next to the sign. Only problem is there's no parking allowed as it's residential area and parking is strictly enforced. We managed to grab a quick photo and get out of there. It's overhyped if being honest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ianbb8
50,A Must Do,"The Hollywood Sign in Griffths Park is a must do.Things to know.This is free other than parking (no need to do the TMZ tour bus visit pay a meter, they take cards)Parking can be challenging during the weekend. Have some patience as spots will open up towards the top or go early in the day before 1pmIt's a hike, on a steep inverted climb at time. I would suggest a light jog with. I stopping or slow movements with a bunch of breaks. This is not for flip flops or pumps / high heels.You will feel your calves burn. Bring water. Bathrooms aren't near once you get on a walk path.Plenty of joggers and parking enforcement (which tow like crazy)We did not go to the very top as we had little ones but we got the shots we desired.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry
40,Tough walk but great view!,"We didn't realise you weren't able to drive close to the sign but luckily did some research before we went so we knew how to get there. You have to park in the street at the bottom and walk up. There's a lot of diversions to try and stop you driving near the entrance but you can ignore them and go through. Parking wasn't too easy and you have to park outside people's houses on a tight road. The entrance to the road up to it is just a green metal gate and it isn't well sign posted. The road breaks off into a couple of directions but luckily we took the right route (some people went the wrong way and it's tiring to have to walk back and go the right way by the looks of it). I'd recommend taking a bottle of water as it's quite a long walk and obviously all uphill. Once you're up there the view is great but there's big metal fencing stopping you from getting to the actual sign. There's security cameras so I wouldn't recommend jumping over. There's only a couple of benches at the top so you might not have a seat if it's busy, but a lovely walk to the top and you can see everything up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sgwads
50,Must do - start early!,"There's a good amount of parking in the area, but the best advice is to get there early. We left our hotel around 7 to be on the trail around 7:30 - there were minimal people around, and parking was easy to find. The three mile hike is great as you can follow one path to take full pictures of the sign from a distance and then continue to climb and end up pretty close behind the sign. The views of the city and water from the top are amazing. As were were walking down we saw more and more people starting on the hike, and the parking lot was much more crowded. It was great to get pictures at the top without the background being crowded with people - and starting early stops you from hiking in the highest heat of the day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayelle44
50,Take Canyon Drive off Franklin Avenue to Parking Lot and then Hike Up!,"My daughter had watched a video on uTube about how to do the Hollywood Sign walk. Apparently, it was outdated and our Uber dropped us off at the gates of a ranch. I buzzed them and a nice man said that entrance was no longer open and to go to Canyon Drive. Eventually a new Uber took us to Canyon drive and from there we could see a parking lot and trail. We blindly started up hill, and I mean UPHILL! So be prepared for a fairly steep ascent and wear sneakers! The walk up to a great viewing point seemed to be several miles. But the climb was worth it. We got a great view from the right side of the sign and naturally had to take all sorts of pictures. From there you can backtrack a bit down the hill and find the other path up to behind (and on top) of the Hollywood Sign. I would highly recommend you find this path even though you may be really tired by now because the view up above the Hollywood sign is spectacular. They have a chain-link fence nowadays protecting the sign from crazy people but you can see the tops of the letters. Up on top you can see forever across LA and the breeze is awesome. While we were there (about 11am on a Friday in late May) it was not crowded above the sign and we could enjoy taking all sorts of pictures as well as just enjoying the view. We came down to the parking lot the same way we went up. All in all, I think my fitness app said we walked about 8 miles! There may be shorter trails, but this was a good one for those of are in good shape. When we got down to the parking lot, we were concerned whether an Uber could find us since my phone did not get a signal, but my daughter's phone worked just find and believe it or not, the Uber driver showed up! Yay! This was probably my favorite day visiting LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
30,Photo opportunity on the red route of the Hop On Hop Off,"We could take one or two photos of the sign from the top of the red bus, but it did not stop long enough to take photos with us in the picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ernao620
50,OK Go See It,You have to see it regardless when in LA. You just need to pray for a clear day. Take your photo and move along.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
50,The famous sign,You have to go and get as close as possible to the sign as you can. We ended up Google mapping the Hollywood sign dog park. Took us as close as you can go. No parking and loads of people taking pix.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45rossite
50,5 star for first timer,"When i was young, i always dreamed of seeing the Hollywood sign or climb on it :P But the reality is not the same, You can only see the sign quiet far, But it's one of my bucket lists & dream so i am giving it a 5 star :) if your a foreigner you need to rent a car from airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msfilipinatraveler
40,Popular tourist spot,I think almost everybody that visits Hollywood wants to get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign and Im one of them. Our family decided to go there and snap a few photos. It is quite hard to get a parking spot especially on holidays. We were able to get a good view of the sign in the Lake Hollywood Park. A good walking exercise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/prettylobster
40,Hazy,"We went to the Griffith observatory to get a good view of the sign, and did the 3 mile trek...when getting there it was hazy...best advise is to check prior to going if visability is good or not",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KRT1966
40,From a distance,"Even though we only saw the sign from a distance, it was pretty cool to see. Not much else to this attraction from a distance, but it was good to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidF222
50,A must place to stop,Had a great time visiting the iconic sign and getting pictures. Lucky for us the weather was great that day and the view was perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpicchioldi
20,Family vacation,"I couln't find it. I thought we were close but we weren't able to get there. We saw it from a distance but on the road up there, there were no signs or anyone willing to help. If you go, you'll be all on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M686CSbryans
40,Perfect view,Just like in all the movies it really does have a magical element to it. If you have a car there are plenty of places to see the sign from Tibet that perfect picture. It can also be seen from the open top hop on off bus tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeEMorris
40,It's right there.....you gotta do it I think,This was one of those last minute decisions with a group of friend and my partner more excited about the trip up the mountain.I guess it's the touristy thing to do and I didn't do it on my last trip but the girls seem to enjoy it.If you are in the area and can get up the road (driving) then why not. It's not really a life changing experience but if the weather is nice there are a couple of parks below the sign so you might make an afternoon of it.....take a picnic.It's a photo op in the end,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/281craigm
10,"Bronson Caves: An Unknown Passage to View the ""Hollywood"" Sign!","Everyone knows to see the ""Hollywood"" sign from Hollywood Blvd. But...did you know there is a hidden path through a cave to view it???We learned about by accident from a local couple who was hiking in Griffin Park (not the observatory) that is accessed off of Canyon Drive. You can park at the parking lot there and take a short hike up to Bronson's Cave. Walk through the cave (100 ft) to the opening on the other side...and you will see the ""Hollywood"" sign without any man made obstacles. Beautiful view!Worth the short walk!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581carlv
40,Hollywood Sign,It was nice to see the sign. The day was sunny but very hazy. We saw the sign on our Celebrity homes tour. It was still far away and a little hard to see because of the haze. Probably should walk if you want to see it up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorryWartPB
50,Must see!,"The Hollywood sign is the stuff of dreams. It is a must-see for any visitor. There are no lights on it at night, so plan a viewing during the day. Go to the observation point where you can see the sign, the Hollywood Bowl, and the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ustravelrt66
50,Very close view,"The highlight of our trip to Hollywood was to see the sign. I thought it would be impossible, but after walking along Hollywood Blvd...a couple of streets before Vine St. and although it was quite a cloudy day...our view was very, very close for pictures we took!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandy_Salsa
50,The Iconic Hollywood sign,"I used Uber to get to the Hollywood sign, which was fine until I realized that there was no mobile reception to get back down. Fortunately, there was another group that had just used Uber to get there when I wanted to leave!!!You don't really appreciate the size of the letters until you are up close. You can get great pics from the base of the sign and there are tours to take you up further than I went. It's a must see when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009
30,Hiked to where we had to stop,"We saw tha sign from a distance, drove up narrow, winding streets and Hiked to where we had to stop. It was not worth climbing the fence to go the rest of the way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnWard2013
40,Long walk,"You can't drive to the shine, so if you really like to be near you have to walk 1h30 up and 1h30 down the hill. Views are beautiful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcoimbra
40,There's only one,There's only one Hollywood sign and if you can get close enough you'll get a good shot. Griffith Observatory wasn't close enough so it's better to get out and walk a little closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polloRemuera
40,Needs more Signs!!!,What stopped me from giving this a whole 5 stars is because the signs are terrible! Not enough signs and if you are not familiar with the area you will definitely get lose. I believe the shortest way to get to the sign is Canyon Dr.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norbertv436
30,from a distance,Just saw the sign from Hollywood Blvd. Took a photo. Nothing really exciting about it. Just to say we had seen it and took a typical tourist photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TangoJ1
40,Smaller in person!,"Must see when visiting Los Angeles, a lot smaller than I expected. The best place to see the sign is Griffith Observatory if you want to save yourself the 1,5 hour hike up the sign, trails are open at same time than Griffith Park but if you are not that fussed about getting a good pic from afar, the observatory is your best option",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/enriqueg974
40,Hollywood Sign,It's nice to see in the front view but if you're up for a hike definitely hike to the back of the sign. The view up there is awesome! It'll bring you to toward the top of the sign overlooking Los Angeles and The Valley. I live in California and have done this hike several times. One of my favorites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadiaa681
50,A must see,With out visit to LA this was my number 1 on my to do list. It was just amazing. A must see. But you can see it nice and clear from the Griffith Oberservotory too - which we did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/765nataliem
50,Now you are in Hollywood,"Now you are in Hollywood This is a must see when you visit Hollywood, and don‚Äôt forget your camera, get all the family in on the photo. Read the history of the Hollywood sign and see what is missing off the end of the sign????",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/981davej
40,Must see,"Must see when visitng Los Angeles, but it is just a sign - what you will see quite far. Maybe, the best place to see the sign is Griffith Observatory. it is about 1,5hour hike up there, trails are open at same time than Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmikko
40,Hard to get a good photo,"When on foot, if you don't have to much time to dedicate chasing the perfect photo of the sign, you can have a fairly good view from the upper floor of the Highland x Hollywood mall with the elephants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingCat22
40,Best seen from the Observatory,"If you need to see it, it is best seen from the Observatory in Griffith Park. Furthermore, the Observatory offers great views on LA downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochassot
40,A good hike with great views of Los Angeles,"We enjoyed this hike which took us about 2.5 hours in total (to climb up, rest at the top and take photos and descend). The trail is wide and suitable for most people. We climbed in the middle of the day and most of the trail was in direct sunlight - perhaps it would have been better to walk earlier or later in the day. The views at the top were great. I was a little disappointed (but not really surprised) that we couldn't actually get to the letters. I would do this hike again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Linda_UK_2015
50,HOLLYWOOD,"WOW! Seriously, just going here to take photos of this iconic sign is amazing.Do not miss this on your trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28becd
50,We went to Hollywood!!!,"One of those places you need to snap a selfie at. We grabbed an uber from Hollywood Boulevard and went up to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive. (Cost $6)There is a park there with a great viewOur first time in LA, make sure you get a pic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paul-n-Jodie
50,Take the Wonder View Trail,"Here's the way my boyfriend and I hiked up and down the Hollywood Sign and what we would recommend to others hoping for a fabulous morning of hiking in Los Angeles:1. Go in the morning on a cool day and carry water with you. There's very little shade on these trails and no available water. Wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen!2. Take a car service to the Wonder View Trailhead3. Hike up the steep first 8/10ths of a mile to the summit of Mount Burbank to get up close to the Wisdom Tree. Sit peacefully as you watch the American flag set up after 9/11 waving in the breeze and share some words of wisdom in one of the notebooks set up at the base of the tree.4. Walk along the ridge line from Mount Burbank to the summit of Mount Cahuenga. The letters of the Hollywood Sign start coming into view. From the top of Cahuenga you'll have unbelievable 360-degree views of the entire Los Angeles area with the San Fernando Valley to the north and downtown LA, Hollywood, Century City, and even a glimpse of the ocean to the south and west.5. Continue hiking along the ridgeline to the back of the Hollywood Sign. Though the sign itself is not directly accessible it's still cool to get pretty close. You still have the amazing views of the city and surrounding areas. You can take a nice panoramic shot standing behind the Hollywood Sign. Hugh Hefner, among others, guaranteed that this land would remain in the public's hands and there is a plaque designating the Hugh Hefner overlook. The top of Mount Lee has a cell tower but it doesn't really get in the way of the view of the back of the sign.6. Stroll down the much less steep Mount Lee Drive, a private access road for the cell tower. At the bottom take a short walk up to Tyrolean Tank and get the closest possible (legal) front-facing shot of the Hollywood Sign. It will be much, much closer than anything you can get from Hollywood itself.7. Order a car service to pick you up at Deronda and Mulholland and enjoy the rest of your day in Los Angeles.Some people would say that the Hollywood Sign is an overrated attraction, but the hike had such a good payoff to effort ratio. In addition to the sign, we saw the Wisdom Tree, those amazing views in every direction, and got a nice, but not too strenuous, workout. Not having to worry about parking made the whole experience easy, stress-free, and fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W7590MLdanielo
50,Highly recommend,We did this with a friend who lives in LA and hikes up there 4-5 times a week. What an incredible experience. We not only went up to see the sign from the front but also up behind it. Views were incredible. A must to do when you are in LA! Yes the walk is long and steep however you'll thank me later.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489shaib
50,Nice Area to Hike,We visited the Hollywood sign area near Griffith Park. Very large area to hike. Walked up to the Observatory and around the grounds. Spectacular view of LA. Worth the trip up and not far from the Hollywood walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RC1258
40,A shot not to miss in Hollywood,"The best place to catch the best view of hollywood sign might not be easy to find. But I think that howwlywood boulvard and up hill surrounding strees are fine.If you climb up to the observatory, you might see it clearer, but it you have to set up your camera in a way to catch the sign. It might appear very small than reality.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunisian_sailor
40,Good day in L. A,"If you want to burn some calories and stay in shape, this is perfect way to do it, besides you are going to enjoy it..because it has a spectacular los Angeles and the san Fernando Valley view from the top of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELTEPECANO
50,"OK, it's just a sign -- but it's an iconic sign","OK, it's just a sign -- but it's an iconic sign, and it has been famous for longer than any of the many other famous things here in LA. If you're going to be in the Hollywood area it's easy to spot; you don't have to get close. Then take that selfie that tells all your friends ""Yep, I'm in Hollywood.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/00Bruce00
30,Disappointed,"We had a view but could barely see it, the white letters you see online etc are not that white and it was lit up at night. However what we did see was ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GloriaM558
30,Iconic,"I would recommend Lake Hollywood Park for great views of the sign, less crowds than at Griffith Park. Not sure if it is normally lit at night, but it was not when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmaier1969
20,Meh,"It's a big sign - no big deal! Snap a pic if you must, just to show that you were there, and them move on to something actually interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jocelynesSK
50,HOLLYWOOD SIGN!!!,"What can I say besides IT'S THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN!!! I took a tour but still you only get to see it from a distance.... Still, it's amazing to see in person!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreapS7870BM
30,It's a sign...,"I know there's a big hype around the Hollywood sign but think about it, it's just a sign. You'd like to climb up a hill just to take a picture of it. Skip it, there's a lot to do in Hollywood and LA in general. This should be the last on your list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18seana
30,Certainly worth a one-time visit,"Unfortunately, there is no way to get anywhere near the sign so it's difficult to get decent pictures or even see it up close. Something everyone should do once, but that is more than enough. Also very tough to find parking as there is private parking enforcement everywhere writing tickets non-stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsg0922
30,Smaller than I imagined,"We really enjoyed visiting the Hollywood sign, and managed to get some good pictures, however I can't believe how much smaller it is in real life than i imagined it would be! Nonetheless still a must see attraction while in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295lob
30,Its an icon so if you're in the area you can take photos almost anyone would recognise,"This is just a sing in reality its only the fact its a well recognized icon that makes it something to visit.There are tours there, but a waste of money, far better to hire a car, drive around Beverley Hills Santa Monica pier and surrounds and while in the neighborhood make the trek up to the iconic sing. there are several viewing areas where you can get out and take photos of the sign int the background.There are views over LA from up there and at sunset the views are enjoyable.You can hike right up to the sign itself but its a very steep hike and unless you find this sign a big deal its probably not worth hiking the couple of kilometers up a very steep winding hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BjL461
50,You couldn't not,"The view from Mulholland Drive, Hollywood bowl overview not just of the Hollywood sign but also of Los Angeles is an absolute must. On a clear day the view is phenomenal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975helenb
30,Hollywood Sign,"This is great to just go and see real quick. If you want to hike to the sign be prepared to spend a good 2-3 hours hiking (3 miles each way)to the back of the sign. There aren't many signs telling you where to go. If you can find someone to ask then definitely do that.If you want to see the front of the sign and don't want to spend all day hiking I would recommend going to the Lake Hollywood Park. You can see the sign close up here, if you want to get a little closer park on Canyon Lake Trail and Innsdale Dr. you can walk up a small trail and see the sign close up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbarreezy
50,is it a movie,no its not a movie its in real life the real Hollywood sign we can see the letters clearly we can also touch the signs and even enjoy it from every where around there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/755rudrap
30,It's a sign!,It's an icon but what else can I say about a sign on a hill. Size isn't everything (so they say) and in reality this seems a lot smaller then expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skypilot46
30,You won't get near it.,The reality is you get nowhere near it. There are viewing platforms on your tour but it's away in distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkPeteD
40,A drive by is good enough,Our trip to Hollywood included a drive by the sign and that was good enough for all of my family. Everyone was just happy to say that they saw the real sign. We could see it from the freeway and didn't even have to pull over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3251ZRcherylw
40,It's a sign,"What can you say about a sign, it was there.We chose to take a helicopter tour to see it and it was probably the best way to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709adrians
40,An icon visible from most everywhere,"Not to be missed, this iconic sign is visible from miles away on a clear day. Not need to hike the canyon to see it up close and you can get a good view from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marblehead750
40,Decent (but hard) hike if you can figure out where to start it,"You can no longer start this hike from North Beachwood Drive (as we found after traipsing up there) so we started it from Bronson Canyon, where there is tonnes of parking.We took the 1.8 mile route, which felt like WAY more than 1.8 a miles and we don't usually struggle on hikes. Be warned: it's VERY steep, and VERY hot if you go when the sun is up. There's no one selling water along the way and there are no toilets.I really struggled getting up to the top, but it was way easier coming back down. We didn't even end up going fully to the top, because every time we turned the mountain and thought we were gonna be at the top, there was another turn to take. And we just had enough (and had friends to meet for lunch), but we got close enough to get decent pictures.Definitely allow yourself at least three hours for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyferjay
40,Best view from Canyon Lake Drive,"Wow, I got so excited driving up there and seeing the first two letters! Best way to see it (pretty up close) is 3000 canyon lake drive!! If it doesn't find it on your GPS, just do 3100, you'll go to the same spot. My GPS send me through the 'mountain' village/town. Narrow streets and a lot of turns, but so much fun to drive!! I kept seeing the sign every once in a while and wondered where I was going to, if this was not the best view. So if you can, take the same road in (or out)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalithaMM
40,"Pretty cool, expect a hike","The sign is cool to see from any part of the city, and you will see it at random times throughout your trip. We hiked Runyon Canyon and had cool views from the sign all the way to the ocean. You can also see it very well from the shopping area by the Dolby Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristentuell
20,It's just a sign,"Yes, it is an icon, but it's just a sign. There is not much to see or do...Time and money could be spent in a better way",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jo_sV5713RD
50,Touristy!,Drove the road to the sign but it was closed off. Still got great pics of the sign from the observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Astros80
40,Iconic,Enjoyed being able to see the iconic Hollywood sign in person. It was a great experience. Definitely recommend if you havent already!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniegC610AQ
50,TEAMSTERS WOMEN,"I stayed at the Hotel Video Review Villa Delle Stelle - Hollywood Los Angeles. It was like staying in a movie and you are the star in it. Pricey, But it was worth it. Wonderful staff and great location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steelgirl7
40,Trail walk,Nice for visitors who want to see the landscape of California. Very good scenic views perfect for pictures this is a good trail for hiking walking or running with multiple routes with adjusted terrain on each trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrZ4594VE
40,The girls just had to see it,"Hey, it's the Hollywood sign. Our now teenage girls have visited southern California a few times but hadn't seen the sign with their own eyes. We drove up to the Griffith Observatory mid week at mid day for a closer view. Not recommended. Traffic and parking were insane. We later learned from local family that there are much better places to get a good pic than the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffkM2101UB
50,So exciting but can't get close danggit!,"If you don't get excited when you see the Hollywood sign then you may need to check your pulse! There are many tours and fun things to do involving this on other than seeing it from a distance, but that's the thing, pretty much everything is from a distance and less you hop the fence and get arrested. Lol! It is highly protected for good reason & is rumored to be haunted by several ghosts as well! Don't risk trespassing! Just take a tour or get it strategically in the background.:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HomeGirlCandace
50,Finally got a picture of this iconic sign,I was so excited when I finally got to take a photo of the iconic sign. I took the picture from the Hollywood and Highland Center walkway in LA. Perfect viewpoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmdavies6
30,The sign we have all seen on TV,"This is the sign we have all seen on TV however it looks less interesting close up, still worth a photo or two to show the folks back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonA_Plymouth
40,Classic sign,This is classic LA and a must see. Right off the highway and you don't even have to get off or loss your place in traffic. Just snap and go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fizzy1991
20,A big sign,"Tall letters. Very tall. That's about it. You can catch glimpses of it as your drive around, or go up to Griffith Park for better views. I honestly don't see what the fuss is about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnH685
50,Hollywood,Hollywood Sign :)Love it !!!Excellent viewsDefinitely coming back to Hollywood ....Recommended !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagdalenaJ17
50,Iconic Sign - Try to See once,"Well, it's a sign on the hill. Yes, it is famous and iconic. Check it out once. Great visibility from the Griffith Observatory and the Kodak Theater shopping center.",
50,Nice hike,"Although it's officially prohibited to hike here, this hiking track is one of the most popular across the city. Definitely worth spending 3-4 hours here, because you get a crazy panoramic view on the city (incomparable to Griffith's observatory and Getty center) and the best photos with the Hollywood sign. Can be tough at a sunny day though, so make sure you have enough water with you. The very top of the hill is very windy, but absolutely worth climbing at. It's better to come here in afternoon to catch the sunset and preferably on weekdays, because the parking if overcrowded on weekends.",
50,Just like it is on TV,Views this from the Griffith Observatory and it was wonderful to see it so clearly. We had a good day!,
50,Looked up and there it was,So was not sure where to even look for the Hollywood sign. Came around a corner and there it was. So exciting. In the distance but it was awesome,
30,Very hilly.... difficult to park!,Lots of traffic and you have to stop on the hill to park. You can not get close to the sign but you can get a clear shot for pictures,
30,Things look bigger on TV,It was good to tick it off the bucket list but I wouldn't rave about it. Things look very different on TV.,
50,Touristy bucket list fun!,"Not much to say about this because you just head up the hills in Hollywood, find a decent spot (there are several stops, but you might have to walk a bit on a steep hill), hop out, and get a picture with an iconic sign. This was something we all wanted to do just to say we had and get our photo op with ""HOLLYWOOD"" in the background. Worth a stop for some touristy fun!",
50,Fun,Took a tour bus to get close great place to take photos. You can also see it at the mall area there is an observation deck. Awesome!,
40,Great sight after a great hike!,"Beautiful sign that defines Los Angeles! Have seen it from hikes in Runyon Canyon Park, in the Hollywood Hills and Griffith Observatory.",
40,You can see it from many locations,You dont have to go all the way there to see it. You can see it from the Griffith Park Observatory which also has a great view of the city. You can drive or walk up to the hollywood sign.,
40,A must view when there.,"Find a guide to take you here as it's not easy to find, quite a climb in the car to get close but hey you can't visit here without coming to take a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenW921
40,Iconic so must do,Hollywood sign is iconic so is a must do for the album. Made it there on a nice windy and sunny day. Nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pipo2968
30,The sign,Can't visit Hollywood without seeing the Hollywood sign now can you? Nevertheless it is just a sign :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdw452
40,Iconic sign,Great views of the sign. Enjoyed hearing the story behind the sign from our tour driver. We were there on a great sunny day so we got some great shots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tupperwarepatty
50,So high up...the Hollywood sign!,WOW! A beautiful view to see the famous Hollywood sign. This is one in a million. Loved it! A must see! :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolS1074
30,Tick in the box,Glad we got to see the sign which is way up in the hills but it was a mission to find it. Directions on internet search engines took us to some weird and wonderful inaccessible locations to view it from. Eventually we went rogue and found some good locations to view and take pics from. Really quite big. I do believe some of the best views are from right down in the city not in the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam421
20,Hollywood sign is Hollywood sign ...,... it is legendary and you want to have a picture of it. That's it. Not much to say about this activity !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisedeSuisse
30,Its a famous place to visit,"Everybody goes there, and we visitted. It took us about 1 hour to drive there from down town. Mostly due to there a traffic to that sightseeing. You can visit abservatory, but most of people visit this place only to take pictures. Not much attraction for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elsultanov
50,Finally we were just in front of it!,Great to see the sign we saw for years on TV in person! Hiking is the best way to see it from the Griffith Observatory Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CG1a
40,Huge,Well it's huge and surprisingly the sign has nothing actually to do with Hollywood.. It can be seen from a lot of places,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siddhi261
40,The magic of the sign that everybody knows,"What I find cool about this sign - apart from its symbolic - is that you can look for different places to spot it.Two good places to have interesting views of the sign are from the Griffith observatory (it's really an amazing spot to take pics of the sign) and from the open square that is part of the Chinese theater where they hold the Oscar awards ceremony.We didnt't figure out if you can still go up to the sign to photograph it from above the sign, with impressive vistas over LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierFromBrussels
30,Cant get close anymore but lots of point to see from,You can no longer get close to the hollywood sign which is disappointing. There are lots of spots which u can take a photo from and most are really the same vantage point. It no longer lights up either. But is an attraction and does make la as we took heaps of photos of it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9402WNaaronb
40,For driving to get a great picture,"People always want to know where they can drive so they get a terrific picture of someone with the big Hollywood sign right behind them. My friend found an address which you can gps to get there, and the picture he sent me from there is what anyone would want. There are two warnings I give: first of all, the drive up is very windy with a lot of turns, so it is best if you have your gps voice instructions on, and you drive very slow. Allow at least 30-40 minutes drive from Hollywood. Second, remember it is a residential neighborhood, so be courteous about parking and don't be noisy. The address you can use is 3236 Canyon Lake Drive Hollywood, CA 90068",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
50,Hollywood,You can not go to Los Angeles with out seeing this sign. We saw the sign from the free way and went up to a viewing point as part of a tour. Amazing views to the city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iamgoldn
40,"Iconic must visit place, horrible parking situation","Miles of street was lined with parked cars and we had to drive pretty far to just get a parking spot. We had gone around noon, thinking that most people prefer to go in morning or evening to avoid the Sun, but it was very very crowded even on a very hot sunny day.Griffith Observatory parking was full and there were two rude people directing the traffic. I recall a lady tried to ask a question to them and their blunt reply was that they were not there to answer any questions. Yes it is a taxing job, but any public interfacing job should require basic courtesy training, in my opinion.Later we were lucky to find a spot at Griffith observatory but one way path to Hollywood sign was 3.5 miles from there. So we decided to come another day and come with good preparations ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/753summ
40,It's a sign... was looking for the disaster to happen,"Well, as many others have noted, this is an iconic sign. Everyone probably has their own memories and impressions of it. Mine are from (really bad) disaster movies... I was waiting for the earthquake, alien invasion, monster, etc. to take it out. Didn't happen so it will be there for you.Sign is visible from almost everywhere in LA... some of the best views include downtown LA from one of the taller towers.",
50,You can't go to LA without watching this iconic sign.,Even though it's really touristy I would say that it's a must if you go to LA. You can see it from different places in the city. We drove up the Mulholland Hwy which had a really good and close view of the sign. This is an awesome place to take good pictures over it.,
40,A must visit to get your photo,we only had one day in Los Angeles as we came over from san diego trip for a day n L.A and went up to see the HOLLYWOOD sign but the roads leading up to it were closed that day so we could only get so far then walk a bit but still glad to of gone.Cant go to L.A and not see the sign.,
40,just like in the movies,"iconic,,,have many photos from all different parts of the city. No need to drive right up there to get a good view",
50,Looks just like on TV...,Great views of the famous Hollywood sign. One key point to remember when visiting the BLVD area. Weed is legal and its in the air...,
20,Boring!,"Really, it is a sign, Look at a picture and use your time to see other far more impressive things in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JWL68
30,Signs signs everywhere there's signs,But this is bigger! Size matters. How can you not come to Hollywood and traverse the streets to get as close as you can. Use Waze. It gets you there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gma0917
50,O.M.G,"When you first lay your eyes on the Hollywood Sign, (it kind of hits you) ""O.M.G"" I've seen it so many times on the Movies, now it's here in front of me. The shopping complex off Hollywood Blvd is a great place to see the famous Hollywood Sign. If you make your way to the top level, to the bridge walk-way, there is a full view of the sign and a good photo opportunity. Another good viewing point is Griffith observatory, the parking is free but get there early because it gets very busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon
40,Hollywood Sign!,What more can be said! It's the Hollywood Sign! Pretty iconic as it's in a lot of movies etc! Would recommend to see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mariakvs
50,YEAH!,"See this picture, see it all ... Not really going all the way up there, but find a location from Griffith most likely and take a pic. You need a good zoom!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fborrull
50,Great experience!,"We had a great tour guide (Bianca) who gave us all the history of Griffith Park. The hike was pretty steep at times, but we were able to take breaks as needed. Definitely recommend bringing some water along. Will definitely do again if we ever return to LA. Ask for Bianca - she's the BEST!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylerw267
40,A landmark of Hollywood,We saw the Hollywood sign from Griffiths observatory. One can get the phot clicked there and have sign coming in background. Its good to see in person after seeing this sign in movies only. We heard that one can do a trekking to the sign as well. Its a landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mansi_Vij
40,Hill have sign,"It was supposed to be a normal afternoon jog at Griffith observatory, turned into a run to the Hollywood sign. From the observatory, it was a 2 hour trek since the main road leading to the spot was closed, you need to take trails instead, but once you got to place..it was an awesome view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancarl0
40,Iconic sign - must visit at least once,"Having seen the sign from afar on many visits before, this was a must do item on the current trip. Was not disappointed. Parking is plenty, but beware there is parking enforcement around to make sure your car is parked legally. Close enough to the sign to be able to take it in without panning your head.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petergharper
50,Saw it from the observatory,"Saw the Hollywood sign from a few places. The closest was the Griffiths observatory. Great to see, but a little disappointed as it wasn't illuminated at night. Not sure if we went on a down day or that's how it always is? A global landmark that is a must see if in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazleech
40,Landmark with quiet surroundings,"Great pictures taken from the canyon drive, on the left of the sign.Great looking propeties to contemplate on those hills. It is worth a car cruse, some treking, jogging, cycling in the surroundings.From time to time a great view over Los Angeles can be captured.Good to escape the city and crowded attractions for a while.",
30,Just a to do,"An iconic sign no doubt, but this is just a photo opportunity nothing more. Take the photo and move out, nothing more to do here. Mostly it'll be included in one of the car tours that circulate in hollywood.",
40,It was actually more exciting to find up close than I thought it would be.,"Following GPS it took us through all of the curvy alley ways amongst all of the lovely little homes with wondrous landscaping. Be careful driving as the alley ways are narrow and go in both directions. No issues there. I was quite excited when i actually saw it closer up. We stopped short of going as far up as we could just because I felt i was invading homeowner privacy. There were some signs that said ""thru traffic"" only. It's just beautiful there. Do it. Worth it. Enjoy!",
20,Car park mayhem,Not wort the time that you have to sit in traffic for what turns out to be a distant view. Park near the bottom and walk up.,
40,One for the album!!,You can't get closer than this but it's a really good place to take a selfie or find someone to take it for you so you can add it to the album and of course your trip advisor reviews...,
20,Famous the world over - dissapointing in the flesh....,"I suppose it is the ultimate testamony for a City famous for the Cinema - a sign that has been made famous by the media and by appearing in asociation with glitz and glamour and yet when one gets to see the real sign - the unedited in the flesh warts and all sign - its a bit.... meh.... I suspect it recieves great reviews simply for being that really really famous the world over sign thats on the TV every year on Oscars night etc etc..... when the attraction its self is not only unwelcoming to visitors its out of the way and rather unloved. So yeah - it has the kudos of the whole ""Hooray for Holywood"" thing and it is a world famous sign - but in reality you cant get close without lots of effort.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me_n_my_rucksack
30,It's just a sign,"So, we drove up to the Griffith Observatory to see the Hollywood sign. It is just a sign, far away on a hill. It's one of those quick stops to see the iconic sign that signifies Hollywood. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you have time there is a nice view of the city on one side and the sign on a hill on the other side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deanna9
50,Iconic Signage,"Got to get pics with the Hollywood sign or it wouldn't really be a trip to Hollywood, would it? Can be seen from many venues, on (fingers crossed) a clear day or later in the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tosh_247
50,The PERFECT Spot for a Selfie Stick,"While visiting Hollywood, your Facebook page would NOT be complete without a selfie (or a friend helping) picture of you with the Hollywood sign in the background.One of the better spots to take this shot would be to drive up Beachwood Drive North of Franklin to right about the 2500 block of Beachwood. Look straight up and you see the Hollywood sign. Snap your picture and go back to other Hollywood attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HT909
50,Must visit,"Getting close to the sign at Lake Hollywood was quite a challange, but once we were there we were quite delighted to take a pic so close by worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelwithkumar18
30,It's what you see on TV,If you have seen the Hollywood sign on TV looking at it 'live' is no mind blowing experience. Just another opportunity to take a selfie and claim you were in Hollywood!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeelikaT
50,With observatory,We are in Griffith Park Boulevard Silver Lake and from our back yard we can see the dig and the Observatory. It's amazing. Our views to the right are of palm laden hilltops. Iconic LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiceylulu
40,Good hike,"If you want to go under the sign , you must be able to hike around 2 miles. Otherwise the best view you can get is from observatory. It's fun to go early in morning",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirk973
50,Great hike to the top!,"Park at Lake Hollywood park for the best views from the front. You can hike up from here through a neighborhood- there are signs saying not too, but an officer told us it was perfectly fine and even gave us a map. Pack water and snack and enjoy the hike. The view from the top is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaCLC
50,Rice/Biggs/Phillips Vacation,The girls took the hike with a friend of mine that lives in Studio City. They hiked from Beachwood Canyon and they enjoyed the 5 mile hike and the views from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lifeandfamily
50,Best view from the Griffiths Observatory,This is such an iconic symbol of LA it really is a must see. The best view is from the Griffiths Observatory which you can either walk or drive up to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J8821HYkarenh
50,Must see!,"This was a must see for my kids and we were able to see it from the Griffith Observatory and it's pretty cool to see from that location. However, you will see it throughout the city as it is always in the background! That's just pretty cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobbyAngelo123
30,We saw it !!!!,"Could not wait to have a photo with the sign, unfortunately you can not get close enough to have a clear photo, it can be seen from various points in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dee068
30,Family Adventure,Always a tourist draw. Kids loved seeing it. Can't leave LA without seeing it. You will encounter a million people and their selfie sticks so good luck getting a clear picture!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seirshalove727
10,It's a billboard. Boring.,"It's far away, and really nothing to see that a photo cannot convey better. it would be a steep climb up to a fence around private property if you wanted a reasonably close view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddD3505IR
50,Must see location,There's something so magical about finally seeing the Hollywood sign in person. It was beautiful and breathtaking. Highly recommend you see this up close and personal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLM821
40,Hollywood Sign,"This is one landmark you must see if you are in Los Angeles. Can't say you were in Hollywood, and didn't!To see it in a movie and think ""hey I saw that!"" Is amazeballs!It isn't possible to drive up to the Sign but one is able to walk closer...by hiking! (About 3-5 miles?)If hiking isn't your thing (no way!) There is a main road where you can see the Sign ahead which is great but best is to drive up to the Griffith Observatory- nice scenic drive and brilliant views to take pictures with the Hollywood Sign in the background.A definite must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Me8ow
40,Kind of hard to get too,"If you look at several reviews, there are several viewpoints. We took one of the suggestions up by the reservoir and it could not have been better. Traffic to get to it is kind of nuts. But this is LA. Good luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcW7208ZC
50,A Far Distance,I parked and walked to the observatory instead of taking the bus. This was a scenic walk uphill. Well worth the walk have comfortable shoes the sign is so far and the angle you view it at are farther than I expected.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/venoniah
50,Definite Must See!,I would suggest taking a tour to get as close as you can to the Hollywood Sign. You will want this photo opportunity!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbtussey
50,hiking the sign,"Have had the pleasure of hiking to the Hollywood Sign about 5 times. It's tough but worth it. Best views of the city. Meeting people along the way and encouraging each other to keep going. You can hike in front of the sign or go around and end up on top of it. Either way, it's pretty cool to be in the hills overlooking a great historical landmark. Can't wait to go again!",
40,Very big Sign,You should have walk at least 1 hour to get there. There is also horse back riding available near the sign.,
50,Hike it and enjoy the view!,"Hiked up to the hollywood sign with two friends, while its not a very easy hike its not very hard either, but its definitely worth it! took us about 50 min to walk up without rushing! we went late afternoon on a nice day, and we got to see the sunset! it was beautiful!Not only is it fun to see the sign from the back but the view of all LA is just amazing! either being as a romantic couple, family or friends this is something to do with everyone!",
40,It's a really nice hike with great views.,Going to see the sign? Get ready for a major disappointment. It's just a stupid sign on a hill. Really. Stupid. But the hike itself is really nice and the views around are great and on a clear day (I know) you can see LA in all it's yukky glory.,
20,Not so great,"We took a great deal of trouble to get out there to see this famed sign, but the experience was not so great, would not recommend anyone to make plans to visit it, but if you are travelling through then its fine.",
50,We Love it!,"Silly as it is (after all, it began as real estate development sign for ""Hollywoodland""),those of us who live here are devoted to it -- it's inspiring, fun, exhilarating! So go to Griffith Park, hike up to the Observatory, and take a look at the sign in all its glory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miriyam
40,One of the best places in LA,"Dare to hike up all the way to the sign. After you arrive to the Griffith observatory, you'll have different hiking trails to choose from. The area is to walk around but I would suggest to go in the early morning to avoid the heat and to find a parking spot if you are driving. Be prepared to wander around cause trail signs are scarce and confusing. Anyways the real rewards comes at being able to get to the transmission station behind the sign or to a plateau just on from of the Hollywood sign that will allow you to get some photos with this iconic symbol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curious401054
50,Amazing sight of the Hollywood sign,The iconic Hollywood sign can be viewed in different areas within Hollywood. To get a a close up and a view high up of Hollywood you can take an amazing Hollywood hills tour. You climb steps and the view of sign is Amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/488annemariec
50,Looks just like the picture,Was so fun going to such an iconic California attraction. We followed directions from Pinterest to get the best pictures. We ended up at dig park with pictures that didn't disappoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happel
40,Right on the Way,It's memorable to see this when driving from Beverly Hills to the pier in Santa Monica. We were so excited it was right on the way!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astridjj
40,Very fun and interesting,"We kept spawning the sign on the highway and just could not find the right spot to see it close enough through the smog. On our Hollywood Boulevard tour we went up through the Dolby Theater and saw the Hollywood Sign perfectly. There were so many people taking photos it was really cool to see it in person (not just on a TV screen or in movies). They say that each letter is 50ft tall.If you don't know the story behind it- it originally said ""hollywoodland"" and as it fell apart the city did not pay to have it replaced. And so a few people took it into their own hands to pay for ots upkeep. I recommend you reading up on it as it.is pretty fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniB206
50,You can't get there anymore from beechwood canyon,"The road is closed, the neighbors got angry with all the tourists traipsing around, so you can stand down below and take a photo but you are not going to be able get there from the path....Boo Hoo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
20,Seriously people it's a sign,So this is an opportunity for some one.The viewing is from a distance and the property to walk to the sign is private!Why doesn't some one charge a fee to have their photo taken at the sign.The roads to the sign are narrow and windyNo trailers !!!The sign is there just like in the photosI guess we can say we had our photo taken there! Big deal!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yogi118
10,It's a big white sign,"It's a big white sign that spells Hollywood. Don't waste your time , take a drive in he hills instead or go to a different country !!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williec2016
50,Great hike above the Hollywood sign!,My husband and I hiked up above the Hollywood sign. There are multiple trails and signs directing you (with distance called out). We chose to climb up above the sign and while it was a couple hour hike in all (we took the long trail) it was well worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimwit11
30,You can only get so close,"We were on a tour and stopped to see the sign. We enjoyed it, but I think there are better ways to see it then what we did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sonyaa269
50,brilliant,i saw the holywood sign from the griffith observatory it looks absolutly fantastic well worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidW5622
50,Must do this,If you are going to be a tourist you must drive to this viewpoint. Leaving Hollywood without this photo will break your heart.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dkboyer2000
20,Not quite sure what to say about it! ahahah :p,"It's a famous sign, you think you can get closer easily and take some nice photos. It's far from the center (really far), it's difficult to access and I don't even think you can get close to it, or at least it's not aloud. the only good photo I could take was from really far. It's really just a famous sign for no reason :p(Check out my intagram for my travel photos!:) IG: anamafalda8 )",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamafalda8
50,You Must Take a Picture,If you are in Hollywood you must stop and take a picture. I took a picture from the Hollywood Boulevard Shopping Mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VA-Short-Term
40,Definitely need to see when LA,"I'm sure at the top of most people's lists. It is an impressive sight and easy to access. You can take pictures easily from downtown, or if you are looking for something more strenuous you can hike on the nearby trail for a closer view. A staple in the heart of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brittcam89

50,Our hike tour,This was the best thing to do. Its a great workout to do while on vaca. Although if your scared of heights not that bad its beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Escape702740
50,The famous sign!,"Certainly one of the symbols of the city of Angels, that needs to be photographed at least once if you're in town. Basically the word itself does not look like anything special, but maybe try to also inform you about the history behind it.It is a shame that is not to illuminate it at night, but overall it is a photo that you can not miss if you're in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelcooking
50,Hollywood,"This was the most exciting part of my vacation to Hollywood. We rented cars from ""I ride like the stars"" to go up to the Hollywood sign. Not only did we have the ride of a life time but we also used our time wisely. If you really want to go see the Hollywood Sign the best and most enjoyable way is to rent a sports car from ""I Ride Like A Star"" this company is fantastic. They let your drive a sports car while enjoying the best scenic sites. Do it you will not regret or ever forget the experience.Best tour guides in Hollywood with the best customer relations you could ever ask for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tebrewer3
30,Good to visit once,This is not a great attraction but good to visit once to experience the sign. Other options are while you are on city tour you will get options to see from far which should be good enough I believe,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srinipamzn
30,You've gotta see it at least once!,"This sign is surprisingly difficult to see, but you have to make the effort, right? It's a thrill when you do see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jd068
40,2nd world trip,wonderful experience through outhotel was a motel but id booked it was good enough smallish pool breakfast was in booking in room cold plate i.e. cereal buns coffee and tea as well as juice stayed there in 2012,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldmannyretired2015
30,Far away,We viewed the sign from downtown Hollywood on the second level of a mall. This is the only way we were able to get a picture of the sign. It's hard to believe how tall the letters actually are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kzonn
40,Fun to Do With the Family,It's iconic. We map quested how to get to the sign and drove right to it through the Hollywood Hills. No tour guide required. It's a great backdrop for a photo or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149paulaa
40,Picturesque View,"This was a memorable moment for me during my trip to LA. This view is available from a Mall at Hollywood. It is only sad that the sign is not visible after the sun sets. They should put some sort of lights so it may be visible post sunset, considering that we are in the 21st century which is a digital era.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pranilbonagir
50,Drive by,"We only seen this from the I5, we did take great pictures from the highway. If we had more time we would have visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sherrih589
50,Great hike,We hiked up here on Oscar night. Surprisingly few people around. Not much signage so make sure to stay on the obvious paths. The view is amazing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eddy2808
50,Still Makes You Excited to See,"Opened our window from Loewes Hotel and there it was and you become a paparazzi! It still amazing how high in the hills it is. There are ways to get close to it eg tours, walks so check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/getawaygang4
10,Disappointing,"You would think they would light this amazing icon up at night. Come on LA, you have the money, use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clusgluk
40,Get that picture!,The sign has a history and it's a definite must have picture! Get a tour with WeloveLA if you want to get the best view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel672478
30,"It's a sign that says ""Hollywood"". That's it","Title says it all. I'm a 3rd generation Angeleno and I don't know a single native that cares. The only time we got excited was when someone vandalized it and it read ""Hollyweed"". You can see it from most spots west of the LA River and trails leading up to it just mean you're closer and the letters look bigger. It's not like being closer to it gives you any more insight or specialness - it's the exact same thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller
50,ICONIC,We had great views from trails in Griffith Park. Lots of good pictures from different angles on the trails. A moderate climb to the base of the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveN519
40,Horse back to the sign,Take the time to go horse back riding to the sign it's the best way to see the sign.we where to lazy to hike it if you do bring water,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hobopiez

50,For A Different View But stunning!,Did you see LA LA Land and want to dance on the same walkway while viewing the Hollywood Sign? Try taking a day time walk around the Hollywood Reservoir. You can't get to the sign from the Reservoir but you will have a breath taking view and have a nice healthy walk and see some ducks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60pjp
40,Great Hike,"Incredible time spent with friends. Great work out, conversation and a view that was awe inspiring looking down into the valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/358stevem
30,A bit overratated place,"The sign, originally HOLLYWOODLAND, is a very famous landmark. The ride up to it, by car, is nice, especially at night when you see the citylights. Otherwise ir is not much to see, the most exciting things are the warning sitws Beware of rattlesnakes...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MatS5101
50,Hollywood sign,If you want to get close to the sign but can't walk that far you can ride horseback. I have done this twice and love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arboje
50,It's still there,I think we were one of the last groups that could access the sign from Griffith Park.It is becoming a liability and they are closing access.It is one of the most iconic parts of America. The sheer number of tourists from anywhere and everywhere that want to see it gives one pause at our country's place in the world.If you go to Universal you can take a great pic of the Hollywood sign with you and you peeps for free at the end of the Backlot tour.,
50,Take the right way!!!,"Well, we planned our day to do easy hike to the Hollywood sign. The easiest and the fastest way is from beachwood drive address 3400 N Beachwood drive, 90068 it goes through the Sunset ranch where you can take a horse and go on a horse ride as well. The hike to the sign is easy and about 3.5 miles round trip called hollyridge trail. The view is great. You can take pictures from the bottom and then go to the top. You cannot come close to the letters as it's prohibited and you can only look from the fenced area. On the way back make sure you read the signs for the direction to the Hollyridge trail as we did not and ended up at the Brush canyon from where we had to hike back up and to reach to the right trail. So our 2 hours hike ended up an all day trip. Good thing we love hiking so it wasn't too bad, the only thing we couldn't do anything else that day as everyone got tired.",
40,Seen from most places in Hollywood,You cant actually get close to this sign so don't be fooled by the tours that say they do.Closest you get is about 1km away on another hill,
40,Cool to see in person!,"The Hollywood Sign is an icon and it was cool to finally see it in real life!! We went to the observatory to view it - there are probably better views and if we had had more time in town, we may have done some of the hikes nearby.",
30,The sign.............,"Well not knowing the area we parked by the observatory and started walking, you cant get to the sign that way, well you can but its a LONG way........... Research on Google first as there is a youtube video on how to get to the sign using the local roads because the locals dont want you to get there through their area as they put signs that look like legitimate traffic signs but they are not...... Do your research first and this will pay off and get you to the sign :)",
30,"Great park, not the best place to see the sign.","Bronson Park is a great park for kids and the hiking trails above it are great. There's also the ""bat cave"" which is really cool, and has a view of the Hollywood sign in the distance... BUT for those trying to get cose to the sign, it is a 5.4 mile round trip from the parking lot. It was nice, but took longer than I would have liked. And there is no shade once you're out of the park. I later found out that Lake Hollywood Park is the best place to grab a quick picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5292KKjons
20,Mediocre,"I would not recommend this to many people. If you are looking for an incredible view, I would go to a good vantage point for viewing so that you can also look out upon the city. However, seeing the sign itself is good enough from ground level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khickster88
50,Checked off our bucket list!,There are several great places to view the Hollywood sign. We especially liked seeing it from Griffith Observatory and Hollywood Blvd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaylal252

50,A must see!,"You can't go to Los Angeles and not hike up to the Hollywood sign! A little tough for elderly, but doable. Make sure to follow signs where you can and cannot go. Police will ticket you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kb1kurt
50,A great hike and cool to see the icon in person,"The day we set aside for the hike ended up having anomaly weather in early October - about 92 degrees and the sun baring down. We packed water and snacks and did a long hike through the trails for a few hours and we had a blast. We didn't encounter too many other people on the trails and we took a few different trails before hiking to the sign. The sign was cool to see but it was the breathtaking views of downtown LA that I liked best. If you have the time, it's definitely worth setting out to hike for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittrtan

40,Cute!,"You can't go to LA and not see the sign! We drove to Lake Hollywood Park 3160 Canyon Drive Los Angeles, CA 90027. They have a nice pull up section where you can get a decent shot w the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessamtz910
30,No one knows where the trail is,"We visited the Hollywood sign, and no one knows where exactly the trail is. We passed many people at this location and no one knew where to go.After figuring it out, it is a 3 - 4 hour hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coconut_Monkey
30,Saw from Observatory,I didn't want to hike but still wanted a good view of the sign. So we drove up to the observatory around 10am before it opened so was able to park close to the top. It showed great views of the city and the sign. Parking was only $4 too. So not horrible at all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kelleyj812
50,I'm one of the last hikers that got the easy hike to the Hollywood Sign!,"This is my second time hiking from the N. Beachwood Drive trailhead. This time, we had to hike on a weekday, and had to walk a little bit further and go through a metal gate.I hiked this rather easy trail up to the viewpoint on Tuesday March 14th, and on this very same day they announced a court ruling to soon close access to the gate (and Hollyridge Trail - which gives easy access to the Griffith Park trails).Shame - now the hike will take 2-3 hours, instead of an hour, and be more of a climb. Nice if you like longer, harder hikes. We were lucky to get it in with our kids who can handle the easy hike, but not the harder hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pokee
50,Walk from Giffith Observatory to Hollywood Sign,"We really enjoyed this walk. I think it took an hour each way, between Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood Sign.Watch the signs as you walk. Coming back, I made the mistake of not paying attention at a 'fork in the road/path,' and turned the wrong way. This caused an extra 20+ minutes of extra hiking, back up a steep hill.Do bring water if you wish to hike for a while, especially if you make wrong turns!A couple of things to note:-Get to Griffith Observatory early in the day, as parking is competitive. By the time we got back to the parking lot, which was around Noon on a Wednesday, the parking lot was packed. And there was a long line of cars looking for parking.-A lot of the travel literature out there says that parking is free at Griffith Observatory. This was true when we went in March, but they have recently installed parking pay stations everywhere, and it looks like they're about to start using them.-We heard that a path that gets you closer to the Hollywood Sign is going to be closed in the near future. I don't know if this is true, but something to keep in mind.-We saw some people hiking up an unpaved 'hydro-line,' loose dirt path to get as close as possible to the sign. They were eventually sent back by someone (Park Ranger?), and they had great difficulty getting back down, having to slide down on their bottoms due to the loose dirt. This might explain why they may be closing the paved path closer to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/product-of-canada
10,Not lit up anymore,Came on a trip into Hollywood especially to see this on an evening and it wasn't evening lit up - so couldn't see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoThackray
50,Required visit,"How can you go to LA and not visit ""the"" sign? We were lucky to have family in town that knew how to get up close and personal to the sign. We had a nice hike up there. It is quite an elevation so be prepared. Worth the effort for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAMBelden
50,A Must,When in hollywood a must thing to see. A lovely hike surrounded in beautiful hilly country side. Not much seating along the way if you get tired. Just remember t bring a drink,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awds
40,Not Complaints Here,"This has become a traditional stop when visiting LA because it is usually a quick stop and it's free. However, on this last visit, we went on a Sunday and I have never seen it so bad. We were stuck on the hill for long periods of time before we could even turn around to find a parking spot below. My husband finally dropped us off and never did find a parking spot do we switched off driving. The sign is pretty far away, so don't expect it to be a backdrop to a photo. It is still fun to see regardless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnYourMarkTravel
30,Use Waze,"The Hollywood sign is difficult to view unobstructed by buildings and trees. However, if you load up Waze on your mobile phone, just enter Hollywood Sign, and you will find a lusting for ""best viewing location"", located near the Hollywoodland rock gate towers on North Beachwood Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizardHntr
40,Wow!,I went on a tour to Hollywood and was amazed to have few pictures there. One is attached in this review.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shahida16
40,Iconic sign so a must see in Hollywood.,"We drove to viewing place but had issues just stopping for photos, tow away trucks are waiting to scoop up your car and charge you. Biggest issue is parking to simply take a few pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trevorkmcc2020
40,Land,Interesting to find out that the sign was done for a land subdivision and originally was Hollywoodland and the land partfell away in a landslide,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsV7116SV
30,Hollywood sign ACCESS HAS CHANGED,"It's a bunch of letters, that's it. The letters originally spelled HOLLYWOODLAND, advertising the real estate development just below the sign. The sign is a good photo opp for those to whom it's important. The surrounding trails are wonderful for those who enjoy hiking...views of nature, the surrounding city and on rare clear days, the ocean.There is no hiking to the front of the sign...it's illegal and you will be stopped. Most people hike to the top of the mountain which is behind the sign. It's a 1-2 hour hike round trip depending on one's starting point. Others choose one of several viewpoints where pictures can be taken with the sign in front of you. IMPORTANT The hollyridge trail, accessed through Beachwood Drive is no longer available. There was a gate which will now be closed to all but Sunset Ranch customers. There may in the future be a different way to access the Hollyridge trail, but that has not happened yet. The best way is to take Canyon Drive off of Franklin. Canyon is a wide street, has sidewalks and leads to an official park entrance with parking and rest rooms. The hke from there to the top of the sign or to the viewing area is about 2 hours round trip. Bring water and sunscreen.If you're not into hiking or are unable to do so, the Griffith Park observatory has nice views of the Hollywood sign and the hills around it...the sign is a bit in the distance but still impressive. If it's a non holiday weekday try the view point by the dog park on Mulholland - good head on view of the sign and place for pictures. Don't try this on weekends...parking is near impossible to find and actually prohibited in the surrounding neighborhood. On weekdays it's easier and locals will be more inclined to direct you. WARNING...be very careful driving through these hillside neighborhoods. There are a lot of substandard, winding roads with blind curves. The increase in tourists has now brought cyclists, drone flyers, skateboarders and groups of pedestrians walking in the middle of the street. There have been accidents as drivers round a blind curve to see a cyclist heading right towards them. Rangers and LA City parking enforcement do give tickets. The entrance on Canyon avoids all of this and there is a BONUS...you're right at the Batcaves...yes, from Batman movies and TV show (see separate Trip Advisor reviews for Batcave info)Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/219robertl
40,Plenty of Places to See It!,"The iconic sign off in the hills? Obviously you're going to snag a few photos of it! While it can be seen from Hollywood Blvd, I'd recommend trying to see it from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xScience
50,WHERE DREAMS ARE MADE,The iconic sign has brought millions of people over the years but what is truly stunning is all of the properties around the sign itself. If you get a chance walk the Hollywood Hills as the real estate is spectacular!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpT2095ZF
50,Spring break 2017,Hikes and bikes tour is the way to get a great view of the Hollywood sign. You will also here the very interesting history of how the sign got there in the first place and how it has been preserved thus far. Fun day. Request Taylor,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qquimay
40,All American Icon,"We checked out the sign from Hollywood Boulevard, and actually had a good view from the open mall area near the Dolby Theatre. Got some cool pictures from that area. ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amorace
50,Worth the climb,Put 3000 N Beachwood Drive into your sat nav and park as close as you can. It's about a 45/60 minute uphill hike to reach the top and stand behind the sign but the views make it very worthwhile. Take water and sun cream and a good camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fuzzybuth
40,"Cool to See, At Least Once","Take a tour up into the hills and they will bring you to a nice spot to take some photos. It's cool to see during the day or at night. You can see it from certain studio tours, like Paramount, as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckkeane411
50,Wonderful view of the Hollywood sign,We went on a private tour from our hotel SLS. Our guide Peter took us to a road locals know of to view sign. Very close to the street where Johnny Depp is purchasing most of the houses for privacy:))).. Fortunately there was rain prior to March 8th so the mountain was full of greens the air smelled so vibrant with flowers and not a bug in the air or an allergy! The walk was special to see the trails to get close up. A must see!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hriggs76
30,Got to see it once in your life,"Well been there done that. Got to say it was on my bucket list to see, and I have now seen it. Its a sign it says Hollywood. No more no less",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ankersandrew
40,It's iconic,What can I say. There is nothing majestic about this signature piece other than it is emblematic of Hollywood and a pleasant welcome to let you know you are in the land of cinema creation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warrenD190
30,Ehhhh,I went to LA and I feel like I didn't do it right. Everyone hypes this city up. But I felt kind of indifferent about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilidanielaa
50,Go to Hollywood sign view point,"Wandering where to go to view this.Input in to ""faze"" Hollywood sign view point and enjoy.The best place to view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IoaMS
50,A Line-mark for Universal Studios and All Hollywood area,The sign is a one of the greatest marks of Los Angeles and probably all of California. Well recognized and seen from all highways and easy to be guided by to reach Universal Studio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raafatg2017
50,"Must see in Los Angeles, CA","Their are a lot of tours that take you to see historic sights in CA. Take one of them. I'm into music/entertainment so seeing the Hollywood sign, Hollywood Bowl and celebrities homes all from Mulholland Drive was well worth the cost, especially if you don't think you will ever be back.",
30,Something you have to see once on your life,"This sign is so famous, and I have seen it so many times on tv, that I had to see it with my own eyes. I have been many times in LA and never saw it. I went to Griffith Observatory and took a couple of pictures of it. Unfortunately, it is far from that point and an iPhone does not have the best camera. It is interesting to know that Hugh Hefner was one of the persons who helped rebuild this landmark.I do not think I will come back in many years to this place, but at least I am not curious about it any more.",
40,History,Just like on tv great history and it's not the same if you don't visit in person get out see the beauty of la,
40,Beautiful,The sign stands on top of a hill. Not visible from everywhere. We went to Griffith Observatory and saw it from there. I just have one word for it - Serene,
30,Overrated but still cool,"To me it's overrated, but it's an iconic symbol, so it's ok. For your friends who've never been to L.A. a must.",
20,It is what it is,When you live in Hollywood and see this sign every day it loses its appeal. Once you have seen it you have seen it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ohsophie
40,Iconic as akways,We were fortunate to view the sign from so many angles during our visit. There are great hiking trails up to the sign if that's your thing. Kind of sad to make it to LA and not see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mercurysqueen
30,Just like the TV,"It is what it looks like on the TV. It signifies the area. The sign is as advertised, but everything around it is a complete disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773careyc
40,Viewed from a far,The sign can be viewed from the shopping mall at Hollywood and Highland but tends yo be very busy with lots of people at the moment. Not a place for a stroll,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hclarke101
30,A requirement when visiting LA,"As a tourist on this trip there is this sense of obligation to visit the sign. It did not leave me in awe or overwhelm me - but I can say it's off my list. The trip up can be exhausting - traffic was really tough. But - it was cool and we have some nice pictures. Again, it's an unwritten rule to visit and take serious and goofy pictures. Go early in the day is my recommendation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1628QJmatthewh
50,Spectacular!,"If you wanna get the best shot for a Hollywood sign photo you must to go to Griffith Observatory, also you can see all L.A. city. If you're a romantic this place is the best to stare the sunset and watch L.A. night illuminated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gustavogN1734IG
50,Iconic,Such an iconic venue and sign. How not to visit? So we not only visited but went to 5 different locations to take photos of and with the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ma-manators
20,Took family for a visit,"Took the family to see this sign from lake hollywood dog park--the best area to see the sign. Tourists take turns to pose, but the wait is not more than five minutes. Use the gps and don't let the gps take you to another popular park. Worth it for a first-time visitor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EcreA
40,Did a tour of Hollywood,While staying in Las Vegas we decided to do a day trip to LA. Cost us ‚Ç¨400 for the trip which is good value. LA is only 4 hours from Vegas. We visited the Hollywood sign as part of the trip. We drove up the Hollywood Hills seeing the stars home and good a good view of the sign but didn't get as close as we expected. Still a great thing to see and was awesome stand in top of the Hollywood hills looking out ofCalifornia - LA - Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leehV9840JV
50,The views,"Worth it to hike to the top of Mt. Lee, even if the sign wasn't there. Cool to see the sign close up, though.The hike isn't too taxing, but the entrance to it is also not well marked. We hiked from the one near the horse ranch. The street is easy to park on and you just have to go through the unmarked/unlocked gate (try the side pedestrian entrance) to get started.The path is mostly paved, which I did not expect, wide and not too extreme. We saw plenty of little kids on it. There is one point where you'll come to a sign that says: ""Hollywood sign .4, Mt. Lee Summit 1.2"" or something like that. If you go left to the ""hollywood sign"", you will actually be well below the sign, with great views, but no way to get up to it. There is some fenced in equipment and motion sensors and cameras around them. If you try to the very steep path behind them, expect the police to come.So we turned back and went up and around the other way to get to the top of the sign. Well worth the extra effort. And you get great views of the backside of Mt. Lee as well.Took us about an hour up, even with the detour, about 30 mins to get back down.Great activity for clear day. Take water, wear sunscreen. Their are no bathrooms or drinks for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valzebub
50,Location location location,Best way to see it is on the Hollywood hills by lake Hollywood park. Best view and beautiful neighborhood. Just please be respectful of the locals and parking. And be careful driving up as the roads are narrow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booby129
30,Iconic Hollywood sign,Just something to no check off the been there seen that. We drove up to the Griffith Observatory to see the sign. It's a nice view but from afar. The sign wasn't as large and exciting as I thought. I guess I was wishing for a closer view. But it's iconic and that's what makes it cool and exciting to go see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabeth0627
40,Good luck getting close!,"The sign is a must see when visiting Hollywood - but its nothing special. Once you've seen it, you've seen it. We drove round the hills of LA trying to get a good view and eventually found somewhere, but even then, there was an orange 'do not pass chain'. We also parked up on Canyon Drive and walked towards the sign for a few pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichlo12
30,little,its really not as big as we were expecting and we found it hard to find a good view of it. Perhaps we would have liked it more had we had the chance to get out and walk around the paths that lead up to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pet87a
40,Now I've seen it,"It's exciting to see the sign but now I've done it that's it. Another thing checked off the list. Not much to say. Pleased the weather was clear and the hill was green cos they'd recently had rain. Late Feb, early March is good time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taylorsouthwest
50,Seen from a distance,See while on our star tours. Very visible and nice to see a landmark of Hollywood! Will visit closer next time in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J3OQstephaniec
30,You need to get a selfie with it,This is visable from most places in Hollywood if you look up to the Hollywood Hills. It is iconic so you really do need to take a selfie with it in the background,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/189shellc
40,Challenging hike,"A challenging, but rewarding hike. Don't expect to see the front of the sign. The LONG uphill walk leads you right to security camera-laden fences at the BACK of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovei2017
40,Best place to get a closer up picture,"I visited the Hollywood sign close up and enjoyed it a lot. I took the N Beachwood Drive by foot though there is some parking along this residential quiet road. At the top you are confronted by a closed gate owned by a stables. The door to left is unlocked despite its appearance. There is a footpath a 100m later on the right just before stables. After the first steep climb you will be close to the Hollywood sign in a readable form. Carry on the path and follow signs to get to the back of the sign also aka Mount Lee. Note when you hit a service road, go right and this takes you to the top. This is a moderate climb if you are reasonably fit. You can run it if your a fit trail runner. There are no water fountains and it's exposed so take care in the heat. The trails are many and you can access other areas such as Griffith Observatory. The views are great both north and south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisjoanneh
30,A great landmark within hiking distance.,A relatively long uphill hike through a narrow canyon in Griffith Park but it's worth it. At the summit you'll see this famous sign and a great view of the City of Angels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrygoff78735

30,Yep! Saw it.,It's funny how I've been seeing this sign all my life. I literally saw it from a far and got really excited. It's nothing much to it. It's a check mark on my list of things to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KNic0le
50,Iconic!!,"No matter what you do on your visit of LA, be sure to get a gander at the Hollywood sign. It's an iconic fixture of the city that you should not miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eluper
50,Lived below it for many years,"Use to live below it for many years and could see the sign from our property. I was able to hike to it numerous times. Very spectacular view. Its grandness always gave me a good feeling. Not sure why since I was not in the ""business"". Now it's a little harder to get near it since the residents are resisting due to the conjested traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603williamo
40,Hollywood sign,"Historical piece of Hollywood. Shame that it conflicts with neighbourhood homes. There is parking, but please be respectful of neighbours and their yards. Great for pictures/ selfies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir594858
40,Nice and never miss,Though I cannot went to near the place but was able to view it. But due to cloud photos were not that great. The sign tells you why thats a must visit place.,
50,It's just a sign,You can't go up to it but you can see it from most of the city. There's great views of it from Griffith Observatory,
50,Breathtaking,Absolutely worth the trip. You can see all of the Hollywood Hills right down into Downtown Los Angeles. The views are spectacular. There are hiking trails by the sign. Its located right by Griffith Observatory.,
30,Iconic Hollywood sign,"We viewed the Hollywood sign from the Griffith Observatory, which offers an excellent view. Although I realize this sign is an iconic institution in Hollywood, it really is not much in terms of a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù sight ‚Äì just another tick on the old bucket list.",
50,every tourist needs to go,"It's a little hard to get too and lots of traffic and travelers. Pack a lucnch, there is even a dog park close by.",
20,Over rated,I went on a tour and they brought me nowhere near the sign. I could in fact see it clearer from my apartment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ddeborahkirby
50,Wonderful hike,"If you take the path to the Left, it is steeper and shorter, and if you take the road to the right, it is longer and more scenic on the way to the top. It took about 30 minutes to hike to the top taking the long route. It was very foggy when we went, so we didn't get great pics. There are a ton of really cool looking trails around there that I would like to spend more time on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalikpapanRain
40,LA landmark,"Mentioning LA the first thing coming to mind is this sign.It's seen from many places around Hollywood and Beverly hills, but it is difficulty reachable (you have to hike a lot).Therefore the best easy reachable views, and one of the closest are from the Griffith observatory. It's just a sign to have your picture with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B1714D
40,The best photo click point for tourists,The best photo click point for tourists. Go straight up top to the griffith observatory and see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanAsh
40,Hollywood Sign,Something you have to see when in Hollywood to get a picture. We did a tour which took us up to a scenic point to get a better view. Even with that it was still far in the distance. Must see but not that big a deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieP152
40,Beautiful view,You get a very good view from the hill especially of Hollywood sign. It is beautiful up there. Loved it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nirajsomaiya
50,An Epic Hike or Run,"I've had the pleasure of running up to the sign several time and it never gets old. The view is spectacular. There are many fun hikes to do in this area. I suggest either buying or printing a trail map, so you will know how to get to the sign. Bring water and avoid the summer months- the heat will destroy you, as there is no shade cover.Another option is checking out Bronson Caves, AKA The Bat Cave, where they shot the opening sequence for the old Batman TV series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runningandmusing
40,The quintessential LA Tourist destination,"No LA sightseeing trip is complete without a picture with this famous sign in the background. Although there are many places from where you can view it, we went to Lake Hollywood park. The location was good and open and we got clicked great photos. Car parking is allowed on the street near the sidewalk. Some people even hike up from this place to get as close to the sign as possible. This sign truly represents LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parul211
50,A classic!,"When you think of LA, you think of the Hollywood Sign. It was so great to be able to see it with my own eyes. I got great views of it from Griffith Observatory and from Runyon Canyon. Did you know it used to say Hollywoodland and was up to advertise land for sale at the base of the hills? The land came off, but Hollywood stayed. Another great place to spot it is on Franklin Avenue at the intersection of N. Beachwood Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VEE1225
40,Thrill,"We waited till our last day to see this. We kept walking around saying where is the sign??? We were determined not to leave Hollywood without seeing this. Little did we know that if we drove up the hill right next to our hotel to the Yamashiro Restaurant and Japanese Gardens, you get a fantastic view. Worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sully4101
40,Wish we had more time to hike,"On Tuesday, January 31st we went to the tip of Hollywoodland and saw the sign close-up. My son wanted to see it and I promised to take photos for back home. When my son saw people coming back down from hiking up to it, he wanted to as well! However, not enough time and we were not prepared for a hike.

It's a 6.5mile round trip 1200 feet up in basically one long steady climb. We did it in about 2.5 hrs (up and down) but allow three to four if you want to go easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyh654
40,Viewed from hollywood park,"The best view for hollywood sign is from the hollywood park. The pics came out to be great. Make sure you come in good weather, if the mountains are covered by fog the sign is not visible. The road to the park is very curvy with some pretty sharp turns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/912arunv

40,Hollywood,The Hollywood Sign is a must visit when in L.AThe only way to get right up close and personal is to go into Runyon Canyon park and climb right to the top. If you are a little more time concious you can drive to Canyon Lake Drive which is the next best viewpoint. There are a few different viewpoints from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessMTATravel
40,"Great hike, stunning views",Well groomed trails. Fairly steep incline. Stunning views of the city. I could see the ocean and mountains that were 100 miles away.

40,Great Views of the Sign,"Experienced the sign when on a Starline Bus Tour. Saw the sign from afar as was given some interesting history about it. It was once 'Hollywood Land' but the 'Land' part was taken away. During the 70s, the top of the ‚ÄúD‚Äù and the entire third ‚ÄúO‚Äù toppled down Mt. Lee, and an arsonist set fire to the bottom of the second ‚ÄúL.‚ÄùAdding insult to injury, pranksters altered the Sign‚Äôs letters to read ‚ÄúHollyweed‚Äù in 1973 (advocating looser marijuana laws) then later, to ‚ÄúHolywood‚Äù, commemorating a visit from Pope John Paul II in 1987.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TashaTait

50,Was fun to see the giant sign.,On tv or in photos it doesn't look that large but it is. I did not plan on going but a tour I took took us by it. There is also a horseback riding tour of it I was told. Iconic Sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenniferbG646ZQ

40,A Must See,You can actually google the Hollywood Sign and it takes you to an observatory way high up. You see people hiking close to the sign even. Just make sure you are patient because it is very chaotic and busy. Have your foot on the break as there is a lot of tourists who don't look both ways ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsbbeckybsb
40,Too Bad it was cover in fog,Drove all the way up to the Griffith Observatory on a weekday evening. Unfortunately when looking towards the sign it was only all blur with some white lights. I suppose thats rare in California but it happened :(;. Will come back again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shuetming

40,Nice Hike,Very difficult to find parking. I was able to park on a residential street. The hike was nice. You can take cool pictures of the sign after a fairly short walk. To go behind the sign it is considerably longer. The views are fantastic and it is nice to hike in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maikai_hoaloha
40,It's a must see,I love the fact that the first time I ever went to LA I could see the sign from the plane as we approached.I have been a fan of movies all my life and I just have to smile every time I see it.Great spots to see it along Hollywood Blvd. and a great view from Hollywood and Highlands center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ledbytheunknown
50,Iconic,"You know that you are really in Hollywood when you see the iconic sign. You can view it well by driving up Beechwood Canyon Drive, or by hiking up to Mount Hollywood in Griffith Park. You can see it well from the Griffith Park Observatory, a great 2 for one tourist attraction. There is no good way to actually get to the sign, but then again, it is best seen from a distance anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13wendyv
30,Go see it in a distance,"We saw the sign from a few pointes, from our room, far away. From a taxi ride and from Griffth Park. That is the best wat.",
50,Finally I saw it!,This was a dream on my list! The place was undescribable with beautiful landscape and houses on the mountains! Its definitely a must visit whenever you're in LA!,
50,All Hail Hollywood.~,"When I first came to Hollywood, the sign was my reminder to dream and go for it. Now, it is a hike to remind myself that it won't come easy. The sign itself represents the struggle and reward of being an entertainer. I love Hollywood.",
50,A Got to SEE when in Calif,Not much to it but something to remove from my bucket list.. i saw to it from roof of an 18 story building that was cool and different,
40,Great afternoon,"There are several different trails you can take, depending on your ability.We chose to go in the afternoon as the heat wasn't as bad. Take plenty of water and suncream with you.It took us about 3 hours for the round trip. The views from the top are fantastic and well worth the trek. We were surprised at how few people go up there.There are warnings about rattlesnakes and wild animals but sadly we only saw a lizard.",
50,Site worth seeing,"No matter how many times I see this sign...it is impreesive and makes you smile.I have been able to see it up close when visiting people who had it perched in their back yard.Seen during morning, dusk and evening and this is movie icon that will remain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebH3152EH
50,Iconic view!,"One of the most photographed places at Hollywood. If you want to get really close, drive to ""3145 Canyon Lake Dr"" and park there - walk ~300m uphill and you are really close to sign. Parking is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
50,Worth the drive up,We drove up to the Hollywood sign when visiting LA at sunset. Definitely recommend doing this as the views are amazing as the sun sets. You can also park up and walk to the sign or park and get a shuttle bus to the observatory where you can see the hollywood sign too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebrob1234
30,View from Mulholland Drive,"It was nice drive from Hollywood Boulevard (about 15 minutes). the traffic was not too heavy and we were able to find car park lots. It was not too obvious as we drove past the car park on the first time.A short stroll from uphill from the carpark and we reached this viewing point that overlook the city and from the side, the HOLLYWOOD sign. We understood that the area round the sign was fenced up and this ""Hollywood Bowl Overlook"" was one of the better places to catch a good view.The sky was threatening but we were glad to take some pictures though it was tad hazy. The drive up brought us past several nice houses and thus, a pleasant experience overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkobog
40,Amazing,"How did they do it? Blown away by the arrangement of Roman glyphs spelling out the world ""Hollywood""Pro trip: it's not lit up at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarrenHumphrey
40,Views without hikes and traffic jams - Bronson Caves,"We tried the recommended options of Griffith Observatory (parking is terrible) and the Hollywood Bowl Outlook (very limited parking and still a long distance view).We stumbled across Bronson Caves as it is the old Batcave in the TV series. I remembered seeing a review on TripAdvisor suggesting you could see the sign from here. In the end, it was the best spot for us. An easy walk, and close enough for the iconic photos.As with most views of the sign, take a camera with a zoom lens if you can, but you'll still do OK here with your phone's camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyAisbett
50,Take a hike,"Best part of LA. This was a lovely hike, the view from the observatory and surrounding area was beautiful. Paths are well cared for, easy walk to top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BezorBear
50,Nothing like seeing the Hollywood Sign,"There's something very exciting when you first see the Hollywood sign. Clearly, it's an icon. It can be seen from different places with lots of photo ops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chefmf
40,Looks just like on television,This is a must see for tourists but don't plan your day around it. There are numerous places to see it from around the city. I would not pay any tourist company to take you to see it. You can get just a close to the sign on your own and save the money for other activities.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kp1128
50,Loved Hiking to the sign,Wow what a great hike with the family to the Hollywood sign from Griffith Park.It's not that hard and it's 100 time better than the Hollywood walk of fame and so much more satisfying to see the individual letters up close that are not aligned in the same plane. When viewed from a distance you can't tell but upClose they are not in the same line !The view from the letters is the reverse of the view in that you look right down the Boulevard and right over LA!MAGIC must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensPerth
50,Hollywood,"Why not visit while in LA. Great views, not much to do up there other than hike. Go driving around the Hollywood hills and look at the nice homes and the way they are built into the mountains",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllenAhi
20,Get your photo and move on,"There's no doubt the Hollywood sign is famous, but once you've seen it and got your photo to show others, it's clearly a been there, done that. There are clear lines of sight of it from many locations around the city. So get your photo and move on to something fun. Been there, done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DMJA21
30,Need zoom on your phone,Everyone loves the Hollywood sign! Have to make sure you either have zoom on your phone or your like a long walk up a mountain. No access to cars,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisamV6562KD
40,Multiple Trails,"On one of our trips here, we decided that we will keep coming back just to hike all the different trails till I got into shape well enough to hike to the sign itself. unfortunately my bf and i broke up before ever doing so but we did hike many trails. the sign is astonishing even from the griffith museum. i would definitely go back to try and conquer the trail one day,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/280biancah
50,Hollywood sign,"Getting to the famous and popular Hollywood sign is a headache, because google doesn't give you the fastest way to get there. On top of that the residents have signs saying closed route and sending you to alternative routes that will make you drive longer. Instead google lake hollywood and it will take you through a residential route and direct to the lake and hollywood sign with a great view. You can drive or hike there is also a dog's park and plenty of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824gabrielam
30,Sight of the sign,"We arranged to take a tour around LA and as part of the route we saw the sign, an iconic symbol, I would say catch it while doing a tour but don't just set out to see it. We saw in in cloudy contiditions and it looked fab so it would look fantastic in sunshine",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4385YZsandrag
50,The Most Famous Sign In The World,"The Hollywood Sign is the most famous sign in the world and one of the biggest, if not the biggest attraction in Los Angeles.Visible from countless locations in LA, but best viewed in Hollywood.You can get close to it on foot, but you can't touch it.The area is off-limits.Go to the Dolby Theatre and go up the stairs.The higher you go, the better the view.Just seeing it is an experience you will not forget.Have fun in Hollywood.It's all here.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
50,Rainy Day Getaway,Itr was raining the Saturday we went; but up at the Observatory is still a wonderful sight and the Hollywood Sign is right in full view. I love going up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kckicks
50,Must See,Best place to snap a shot is Griffith Observatory. It is right there with nothing distracting the view or getting in the way of a great photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/383elisae
50,Great hiking!,"We hiked from the old LA zoo to the trail the puts you right under the sign, and everything in between. Spectacular views and well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabesa2016
20,It's a sign,It is what it is. If you've seen it in movies or pictures you'll know what it looks like in person. Go see it from Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403dean
30,Viewed from The Hollywood and Highland,"..Where the Dolby Theatre is. Climb up a couple of levels and across the balcony area for a good view. It's not the closest but it's free and all you need is a telephoto lens! I've taken a pic on my mobile so you can see how actually far away it is.I can't say I was too bothered about getting closer to the sign at the time, we just wanted to see it really, LA is huge and we didn't have enough time to figure out how to get closer without wasting a few hours (relying solely on public transport). A must see for obvious reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muirsontour
40,Its a must of you are in LAX!,"Just make sure you park the car on a place where you are not going to make an accident. Then walk a litter further than other people used to stop. Its a bit of a walk, but I promise you will get a better view, and a better photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96melissav
50,See it from Dolby Theater,"Get a good view from the Dolby theater (dont miss taking the telephoto lens). Alternatively, take the celebrity homes tour and they stop at a point which gives a good view of the sign as well as downtown LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/voyagerclicks
50,View from Griffith observatory,You can see it driving around and a better view at Griffith but still it's not that huge in photos wish I got a better chance to get closer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberjade92
50,Long walk but worth it!,The Hollywood sign is something what you must see if you in L.A. We got a taxi and asked the driver to take us as near as possible. You can do great photos from there but if you want to see it behind you have to climb there. May take an hour and half but definitely worth it. The view it is unforgettable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/709timis
40,Finally,So cool To finally see The sign which I have always seen in The movies! You can see iT from The streets between buildings in Hollywood. I did not come any closer than that though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/selvettav
30,The Sign,Well its there but very over rated you cant get near and it doesnt look in good condition at present.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmargaret2013

40,Great to see it,We were very lucky to be taken to a residential park that had a superb view of the sign great photos,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/391lucindaj
50,View from the Hollywood Bowl,Spent the 4th at the Hollywood Bowl watching Chicago celebrate our nations independence. The fireworks were magnificent over the Hollywood hills in front of the sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D2281TBangelac
40,Bucket list thing,It's sort of something you must go and view while in LA. You can get a decent view of it from the observatory but it is still quite a fair distance away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
40,Hiking to the Hollywood sign,"Sure, you see the Hollywood Sign from all over the area... but to experience it, up close and personal, is really the only way to experience it.There are several trails leading up to the sign, from either Griffith Park and the Observatory, or the Bronson Caves (where you'll find the original Batman cave).One trail leads you all the way up on top of Mt.Lee where you can experience the sign from behind, overlooking the entire Los Angeles area. The others lead you to several nice photo/selfie ops in front of it.It's not a very hard hike, but it's steep and takes a while, so make sure to bring plenty of water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thunderberg
50,A must do photo!,"Griffiths Observatory is a good place to see but not that great for getting 'that' photo that you want. Most cameras don't have the focal range to get the sign at a reasonable size with you in it selfie style.Molholland Drive lookout across the Hollywood Bowl is better, but my suggestion is...The junction of Scenic Avenue and Gower Street! We found this was perfect! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dwain_Pipe
50,"From Walk of Fame to Hollywood sign, a must do!","I walked all the way from Walk of fame to Hollywood Sign in January. Luckily the weather was so pleasant, it was partially cloudy at first (that is a good help for me to avoid sweating a lot), there was a really nice breeze and then when I made it to the sign, it was kind of sunny. When you get there, you have the sign and the pretty mountain at one side and the amazing over view of the city of angels at the other side that continues to the ocean. Try to get there before sunset, then you would have the chance to trace the sun setting in the amazing view. Try it on foot ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CallmeMatthew
30,Hollywood.,"The sign had been altered to say something else when we were there and was all over the media. From a distance the sign is what is seen on many photos, still a sight to see for real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianC407
40,A must see,"It's a must see in Hollywood seriously, being a bit of a movie buff I love Hollywood and everything about it.The best place I found to view the sign and gives you an amazing view of LA isn't actually the Griffith observatory, it is in fact a small look out on Mulholland drive looking directly over the Hollywood bowl.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrbensonw
50,Out for a walk,"Walking up to the sign, a good work out. Went behind the sign & in front of the sign itself. Two different routes, great view from the road behind the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer149300
50,A great activity,We walked to the sign from our Hollywood hotel. It was around a four hour trip where we saw lovely homes and easy to walk ( laugh steep) trails. Great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyG475
50,Get as close as you can....WAZE will get you there,Dont just see the sign...SEE THE SIGN. you can get super close if you are up for navigating the streets and hills. Let WAZE take you there...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gma0917
50,Awesome,What a great experience !!! It's a simple place but it's so worthy to be there. Just make sure if you take a Uber put the address for Lake Hollywood Park.... it's so nice to be able to see a place that you have seem since you were a child... I love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elisawth
50,Impressive view point.,We were lucky to have a good tour guide who took us to the perfect spot to see the Hollywood sign . Stunning views helped by it being a glorious sunny day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjsweep
40,Horrendous Parking but incredible views,"I would have given this 5 stars except for the bad parking. I'll admit it; I'd never been there before, so there may be better parking, but we had as long of a walk from our car to the base of the hill, than from the base up above the sign. That being said, once you get up there, you truly do have a remarkable view. I would recommend anyone who is remotely active to do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7912GPjosephb
50,Photo required under sign,Makes me feel like an American with my photo under the Hollywood sign. Really Cool. It was on my bucket list and it proves to everyone that we were there,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeangregorywh

30,It's a sign,Yup it's a sign that is iconic....still just a sign. Snap a pic and check it off your bucket list. Make sure you see it on a clear day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodcritq
50,It Must Be A Sign,"As seen on TV and the Big Screen, The Hollywood Sign is still there, What more can be said? Well, I guess you have to say more as it needs to be 100 words. SO, when IN LA go see the Sign. It reads HOLLYWOOD",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kramer1113
40,What a magical moment to see the sign so close,"I am a movie lover and wanted to see the sign ever since I remember. It was fantastic, shame that the road was closed, we could not get right to the sign. We parked the car about 500m away by Mullholland Rd",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384renatan
50,Hollywood sign by car,We got off Hollywood blvd across from the Toyota of Hollywood store. The trick is to follow all the streets that say no exit all the way to the top. You can take great pics from here. I would NOT suggest hiking up the hill from here since it is very steep and rattlesnake country.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tjetty
50,A nice view of the HOLLYWOOD SIGN,"A great view and a glimpse of the LA basin, with a historic view of the famous sign in the background. A must if your only visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuntScotty
30,HOLLYWOOD!!!!!,"The sign that everybody knows. It is a must see while in the LA area. Worth a stop for a souvenir photo, but it's still just a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman

40,Great walking destination,"We weren't prepared for the amount of time it took to walk from Griffith Observatory to the bottom of the Hollywood sign, but we are glad we kept at it and got the iconic photos at the end. The walk is not difficult and the people on the trail are friendly. The views along the trail and at the end are great. Schedule this activity for a full morning to make the most of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MES767
40,Has to be see no and photographed !,Iconic sign which must be seen and photographed. Can be seen from the street approach to Griffith Park and closer while hiking the trails in the park .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vmdUk
50,Its a nice hike. Worth a visit.,Its a nice hike. Worth a visit. its steep at some places. it takes couple of hours to complete the entire hike upto the flag. Nice views of LA city from there. I could not find any restrooms during the entire hike so please bear that in mind. Also I could not see any place where you could buy snacks/water so do carry that. its a lovely walk. must do if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deepak_NewDelhi
30,Here's one place to take a snapshot,"We wanted a picture of the sign before we left LA, but had saved this until too late to drive north to get closer, when the airport was south (and the traffic around here!!!). So one place we read about and was a neat place to take a pic, albeit kind of far away, was the plaza at the corner of Highland and Hollywood. If you can find parking somewhere along the road, go to the intersection and go up the escalators. At ground level there is a neat fountain for kids to play in, and there are many stores and restaurants if you want to hang out longer. There is a promenade where you can stop and snap your souvenir picture, and then head back down to continue down the Walk of Fame, or visit the Chinese Theater or Madame Tussaud's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monique9807

40,The Hollywood Sign -- Just like in the movies,"I had seen the Hollywood sign in numerous tv shows and movies. I had heard and read about it in numerous news stories. And, finally, I was able to get see this famous sign in person. It's quite impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl2010
30,Hollywood sign seen from Hollywood & Highland,"Driving from Las Vegas to Malibu via LA (Hollywood Boulevard) we only had 3 hours in our tight schedule to have lunch, wander around the walk of Fame and the TCL Chinese Theatre forecourt (stars' hand and footprints), walk past the Dolby Theatre and see the Hollywood sign.So rather than driving to the Hollywood sign, we opted to go to the top of the walkway bridge in Hollywood and Highland and got a great view from there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevanw2014
50,Hollywood Sign,"Must see, we hiked 10 kilos round trip and took a lot of photos with the Hollywood Sign it was a greet day and great experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mais403
50,awesome walk,"we were here the week it opened to the public..... the locals weren't happy and made it verbally clear, but we were! There is so much land, it is like a state park up here and should be accessible to all. The sign itself itself is still a good distance from parking but the land is owned by taxpayers and the local residents do not own it so don't let them intimidate you law abiding people. Parking isn't even on their streets when they open it up........parking is all along the road up to the sign where there are no houses...... enjoy the ride and the walk and don't listen to the griping and complaining if you encounter an angry local.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cararox
40,A great sign,"Could see the ""Hollywood Sign"" from the Griffith Observatory. It is a great sign famous throughout the world. People go there by hiking also. The bold sign is clearly visible from great heights only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshwaniC
30,Overrated but why not?,"Probably the most overrated place you're ever going to visit in your lifetime. Still, do it just for the sake of ""why not?""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mario0404
40,But such a long way away,"The sign is so impressive. Big, bold, but so far away. The real indication that you have arrived is also proof of just how big Hollywood really is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PacoH_11
50,Brilliant Hike,"We done the hike to the Hollywood sign while on holiday, we left around 7am and it was a perfect time, it was very quiet and not to warm to walk, as the hills are very steep. Definitely worth the hike, as the view is brilliant!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1507ZLgemmab
50,Did I see HOLLYWEED?,"This is the iconic Hollywood sign. Every once and a while someone will climb up and with a few strategically placed tarps they create ... well the HOLLYWEED sign. This is a wonderful walk or hike for everyone in the family. If you have little ones the distance may require a few piggyback rides, but its worth it. Truly beautiful sites to be seen from above and beyond the Hollywood sign. Give it a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corostone
20,It's a sign- big deal,"It's a sign, you've seen it before, certainly wouldn't go out of my way to view it. Most of LA isn't that interesting a destination and this probably some sit up, overrated rubbish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burgo1804
40,Iconic Sign,Easy to see from many parts of the city but even better up close. The sign is an iconic symbol of the city.,
40,You Just Have To See It!,"If you're in the area, you just have to see the Hollywood sign! We drove up Mulholand Dr. and pulled over on an overlook. Yes, it would have been nice to get closer but this was okay too. It's hard to get pictures with someone in them because you either can't make out the sign or just part of someone's face is in the picture so you can focus on the sign. Who cares though, it's the Hollywood sign!",
40,Iconic,You can travel to the top and see the sign or you can see it from Beverly hills area and take pictures from most places.,
40,Good to finally see in person!,"This is a must see if you are in the LA area, however it was disappointing to me the fact that you can only see this from a distance. I thought there was a way to get really close to the sign on a car, but it seems you have to hike your way to it. Since I was visiting with my parents and kids just hiking was not an option. Everybody was so happy of seeing the sign we had seen many times on TV!",
30,Great to See ... Once,It looks just like you see it in the movies.You can't really get close to it but there are a few spots that recommended. The Griffith Park and Overlook Bowl at Mulholand Dr are probably the best places.We've tried the Griffith Park but there were a lot of people and not a lot of parking. The parking is along the mountain so there would be a lot of uphill walking.Went to the Overlook Bowl and it was a great place to see the Sign and also a great view of Los Angeles. The the Bowl there is very very little parking nothing else so people don't tend to stay there for a long time.,
50,HOLLYWOOD LAND SIGN IS AMAZING AND ON LAND OWNED BY HOWARD HUGHES CORP.,"Loved driving up in hills to sign, very cool area of city. Rich history on ownership, so do your research on to too, but rumor has it that Howard Hughes trust still owns the land it sits on? Truth, Im not shocked, the man was brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
50,Great to see,"It really is a small sign but we loved seeing the it in person after years of seeing it on our television screens. A great place to see the sign is from the Griffith Observatory, also a great photo opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcrleigh
50,Fun,Fun to be close to the iconic sign and take a few fun pictures to bring home. Thankfully they fixed the sign before we got there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcbishop
40,Tour attraction,Must see if in Hollywood! We're able to take pictures from bridge off street by Hollywood stars. Easy to get to because there are elevators & escalators. Busy area for tourists. It was the afternoon of hollyweed on the hill that morning. Got changed back to Hollywood fast! Quite a ways away for real close up pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/495marshak
50,Rose parade,When we toured the sign it had been tampered with to say Hollyweed. Saw from a distance at the back of Dolby theater,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortymom60
40,Great to see,You see the Hollywood sign from a distance. Great to take photos. We were at the Griffith Observatory and there are wonderful views of all of LA from that vantage point. So happy to have seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravel0416
30,Take the photo then keep moving,If you visit LA you need to see this sign at least once...after that you should look the opposite direction for a fantastic view of the city...at Griffith Observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenC162
40,I love seeing it,"I've been to L.A. a few times and still get excited when I see the Hollywood sign. I haven't tried getting close to it, which would be great but sounds like a pain. It's so iconic that just seeing it from afar is pretty cool. My favorite spot to see it is from Hollywood Forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindap2017
20,Disappointing,"What a disappointment. Maybe we should of done more research, but we really thought you would be able to get a little closer instead of staring from an absolute distance. At least we saw it is all we can say!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kohinoor12
40,Visit to the sign was as expected,Glitz and glamour is the symbol this sign represents. We were taken on a tour that had a good look at the sign and that was pretty good. Worth at least the photo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baylovers
30,not lit at night,"I was oddly surprised to see the sign disappear at night time. I guess neighbors complained about it. you can illegally hike to the sign if you choose, but after new years 2017 vandals I expect this to get harder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justins866
30,Is what it is,I know title sounds obvious but it's a must do if in LA but it is what it is.....you can't get up close to it any more so you go to one of many viewing points probably via a bus tour. It's good & you need to see it to tick it off the list but that's about it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Businesstravels1114
30,Hollywood sign a bit anticlimactic,"The Hollywood sign, while iconic, is difficult to get to and the people who live near it are snobby and don'the appreciate visitors. They put up fake signs making it hard to reach the sign and have a private security team that comes and shoos people off the heat mountain regualarly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bktravelly
40,First time visit to Hollywood Sign,"Visited on 25th Dec 2016,very first time. It was a nice drive. But we did not get the parking lot , we were going around the mountain.Came back again and parked the car in the parking lot next to park below, walked to griffith observatory, from there we walking upwards to observatory. It was a nice walk and short trucking too.But not able to go near to the HollyWood sign, were watching from Observation only.. But the trip was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohang369
20,From the bridge over the highway.,Seen it from a distance walking to Dennys for breakfast. Was clear day so I can say we seen it in real life lol.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/186savages
50,MOVIE STAR CENTRAL,"If you take the correct route youll end up right above the Sign and also get to see Los Angeles from way above, a historical land mark for many obvious reasons. getting to the sign isnt that hard im a very heavy set guy and the hike to this place is very easy for anyone even children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jersonf494
50,Was great to see!,Went for a drive up a narrow and very hilly road to see the sign. The views were amazing and def worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4599AAlisam
40,"It is very interesting and iconic. However, don't expect to get close to the sign. But it's just what it says it is ---","You get what you go there to see, a sign. But this one is different because, chances are, you've seen it in movies numerous times, and now you finally get to see it ""in person"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnv975
50,Hike it or view it from afar but do not drive it,"I'm a local who hikes the trails around the Hollywood signfrequently and have witnessed how tourists clog upthe narrow winding roads on the approach to the signdespite the closed road signs. I say do as the locals do:park below and hike up. Be aware that hiking meanswearing sturdy shoes, a hat and bringing water,especially in summer.Many tourists have approached me about directionsfor getting there, wearing flip flops and sandals.It makes it very uncomfortable --these are real hills, and the trail is long. You can't geta good cellphone signal in the hills so forget aboutan √ºber pick up.Once you get closer (it is illegal to get very closeto the sign), there are many photo opportunitiesand gorgeous views of the city of Los Angeles.It's well worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuntressCA
40,Beautiful,It looks great from different angle. More closer you go more bigger it looks. It's really really big.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/362pawang
40,The LA Icon,"This is possibly the most famous landmark of Hollywood. We drove around the town to find a good spot to view the sign. There are many places with a good view, including the Hollywood boulevard but the best and unrestricted view we had was from the Griffith observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/824deveshd
50,What you expect,This is really just one of those photo opportunities you don;t feel able to leave Los Angeles without. Our children wanted to see it so they felt they really done the place (and to show their friend the photos). It's a good walk on a warm day and the primary benefit is the great views you get of the city and the mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38helenf
50,California Vacation,Hiking to the California sign was so fun! We hiked the Beechwood Trail to the Hollywood sign. It was a fairly easy hike and there were great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy083
50,Great Photo Opportunity,The hollywood sign looks exactly like it looks in pictures. It can be seen from many locations in the city. I definitely recommend finding a good location to take a nice family photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomt71
50,One of The Main Things Checked Off My Bucket List,"Coming from Ohio, hiking the Hollywood Sign was something I always dreamed of. On my first cross-country road trip, this dream finally came true!Be sure to bring lots of water, and try to use the restroom before beginning your trek up to the sign as there are none available. We decided to be more adventurous and go off the path and into what I call ""the wilderness of the hills"". Definitely not the safest or quickest route, but hey, we made it! The view across Los Angeles is absolutely a dream.Our way down however, turned into what was the most difficult as we somehow managed to get lost. We winded up leaving Griffith Park and entering a neighborhood, where a police officer laughed at us with pity when we asked how far the parking lot was... long story short, what was supposed to be a 6 mile hike turned into over a 10 mile one.Absolutely amazing, and I envy those who live there and get to experience this all of the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/messyjessie1996
40,Hollywood sign,You can view the sign from a distance near the chinese theater. There is also a area near the sign that you can hike to. It is at least a mile and I didnt do it. At ertain times there is a shuttle Im told,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cat330
30,Not as impressive in person....,I was expecting a real WoW experience based on how the sign is shown in movies and on TV. Sign is not visible at night because it is not lighted. You can only see during the daytime from a distance. Not a big deal,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gothamcitymom
30,Tough to get there,Crowds were awful. No parking close and long walk before you even got to the trails to hike. It is iconic but allow plenty of time to park and bring patience to deal with all the tourist who also don't know what they are doing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbbyers67
40,Hiking here is fun!,"Went with a group of friends hiking up to the Hollywood sign. Although the actual sign is fenced up, we were able to get close enough for pictures. The views are breathtaking. The hike was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elenavC4846PE
50,Hollywood sign and hike,"It was my 19th birthday on July 2, 2016 when I hiked on the trails up to the Hollywood sign. The view was spectacular you could see the view of the different valleys around Los Angeles. You can see the Hollywood sign from the fencing but you can never walk down to the sign itself. The one thing that caught my eyes the most was the view. It was a long way up but I've managed to hike up there. this hike is something you must do when you visit Los Angeles. The hiking trail that I went on was once a private wide open road that lead you up to the top of a mountain. The road is Nice and wide and it is perfect for people at all ages. The best views are on a day where it is not too foggy and clear. However you wouldn't be able to see the view on a cloudy day. All in all it gives you a very serene feel. Get your work out because it requires good exercise in terms of walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddhakouri
40,Amazing views,"There are amazing views of the Hollywood sign from Griffith Observatory and Runyon Canyon, but I wish there were trails leading up to the Hollywood sign instead of seeing it from far away. It would be good to take pictures at the actual sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L116GDstephaniew
50,Awesome!,The view is amazing! We were able to get pictures and visit the area as a part of the Ultimate Hollywood tour (definitely recommend this tour).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsKiesha
50,Hollywood sign hike,"The hike to the Hollywood sign is a great and quick trip, as a local I take friends and family on this trek, and they get a kick out of it! The trail is dog friendly with many dogs along the trail. During the summer months it gets hot and there is no shade whatsoever, so bring plenty of water and sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/soapypants
30,Don't plan to get close,"This can be a nice stop on your way to something else, but just don't plan on being close to the sign because you aren't. Parking can be challenging so plan on spending some time looking for parking and walking a little ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702dougt
30,Road is closed,"I was very disappointed to find out the is no way to drive to Hollywood sign only walking. However, it looks good..period",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Falconi66
30,See it from Runyon Canyon,"My friend and I were doing the Runyon hike and had a nice, clear view of the Hollywood Sign. It's just a sign, there isn't much more to say but there is something fun about seeing it. The previous year I had seen it from the Griffith Observatory, which is probably a better viewpoint.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
30,Worth looking from afar,"The ""Hollywood"" sign, an iconic landmark, of Los Angeles is one of the emotional attachments to visitors of Hollywood. It is well known around the world because it was featured in many movies and later was promoted by various means as part of Hollywood, the industries. I was up there once long time ago when visitors could get closed to the sign. For many visitors, to get the good view of the sign is a package of visiting Hollywood. If you are visiting Hollywood, the best place to get the good view of the sign is on the 4th floor of Hollywood Highland Center. Snap your selfie with the sign behind you and move on to other things in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrawetJ
50,Enjoyed the view...,"You will have to either hike there from Griffith Park or navigate the winding roads to get there, but it is worth the experience. We went on a beautiful, sunny day after a rainfall so the hills were green. The air was clear of smog, so the sign was crystal clear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaeddie
20,What does a sign say!!!,"Literally, what exactly can one enjoy about blocks of letters standing upright on top of a mountain? Except for just the fleeting feeling of looking at it and feeling the Hollywood goosebump (if it ever can excite someone), there is absolutely nothing more to it. I felt I burnt a copious amount of fossil fuel driving up to the hill trying to get closer to the sign for nothing, and even the view of the city was not proper (blocked by hills). Deserves a shoot-and-scoot visit not more than once in lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scI-ROCKco
20,This is not worth the effort to try to visit close up,"Access to the sign can only be made by trespassing since the area is fenced off. There are regular patrols in the area which routinely intercept folks who decide to go over the fence. Back in the day, some high school miscreants I knew would routinely go up to the sign to party. Occasionally they would take sheets of black and white fabric so they could alter what the sign says: One year they made the sign spell ""Hollyweed"", lol. Blame them for the security the area currently has.You can drive rather close to the sign on the residential streets in the area, but be warned. The residents of the neighborhood hate that tourists come up there are will report folks to private security if they feel you are being a nuisance.One suggestion is to go to the observatory from which a nice view of the sign can be had. The observatory is rather cool in itself so it's worth your time to visit that spot too and get a good pic of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2131POstevens
40,Go to Griffith Observatory for good pictures,Nice drive up to Griffith Observatory and pictures with the sign behind us. Also got to see the historic Greek Theater on the way up. Beautiful view of LA below too. Had great views and got several pictures with different back drops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723kima
40,As what you see in the movies,This sign is so popular that it was featured in several movies. It's so popular that cities in other parts of the world put their signs on the hill like the Hollywood Sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanRocqueRaltique
40,It's a landmark!,People obsess over this. We were able to drive close to it. We we were unable to get behind it. Good for a few pictures and then check it off the list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bima01
40,Must do,"If you are in Hollywood, you must have your picture made in front of the Hollywood sign. Go all the way down beside the lookout on the right side of the Griffith Laboratory for the best photo spot. Beware of the restrooms at this stop---so nasty!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvtotravel0330
40,Hiked up behind the sign,"I took the very steep and strenuous hike up from the neighborhood to the Wisdom tree, and over behind the sign. It took about 2 hours total and was hot and steep! The views from the top are incredible though, and well worth it. Bring water and I would not take children if hiking the trail up to the Wisdom Tree first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamreebel
50,Great,From 3000 Canyon Lake Drive you can see it very well! There is a park but if you go a little bit up the street the sign will be visible much better. I had no problem with legal parking in the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piotrh1982
50,An iconic visit,Hope the smog is clear and you get a beautiful day to see this sign. Visible for miles so millions of types of pictures can be taken with cool backdrops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiderwoman808
20,It's a sign,"I know. You are in LA and you want everyone to know you are here. Go half way up the hill, find a spot where you can get the sign in the background, take your pictures and move on. Or buy a postcard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyoty
50,Truly a beautiful location,It doesn't get better than taking a hike and see in the Hollywood Hills Sign get your camera grab some friends hop in your car go take a hike and see one of the coolest attractions in Hollywood bring lots of water at the perfect pH I suggest alkaline water definitely do the trick,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeFoodcritic
50,Above the Hollywood Sign,"The Hollywood Sign is one of most iconic spots in LA. It is located in Griffith Park just under the peak of Mt. Lee. I usually walk there from the Observatory car park, and it takes around 2 1/2-3 hours round trip. This hike is not hard at all, a kind of beginner to intermediate level. You can go up fire roads or trails. During the summer it is important to have enough water, as there are long stretches of the road without any shade, and the temperature can go to low 100's F. The view from the top is gorgeous, on one side is San Fernando Valley, and on the other west parts of LA and Hollywood Reservoir. On top of the mount Lee, you end up standing above the sign (the sign is fenced, you can not come directly to the letters). There is usually bunch of people on the top taking pictures :). The Hollywood sign walk is always great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeaM1408
50,Great LA Views,"One if the best views of the city, the sign from Griffiths Observatory and on a winter day it offered great views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WheelsUp
40,It's a sign.,"Like the title says, it's a sign. But that sign is famous around the world so we had to see it! We went up there and it was a mad house BUT my one tip? Drive all the way up to the observatory and into the parking lot. We saw alot of people parking way down and walking up. We drove it and ended up finding a spot two rows in and there were other empty spaces! Is the sign from there? Yes, but we never intended on walking up to it. We had kids so we just wanted to stare at it and snap a few photos and go. It worked well!Good luck!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roaminthaworld
50,Wow,That is how you really know that you are in Hollywood. Lots of places to take pictures and enjoy the view. On the Hop on/off bus there was greata commentary on the original sign Holywoodland and all the changes that had happened wince then to make it the landmark it is today. Great to see,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandlew00d
30,Take the picture and just go,"The Hollywood sign is Los Angeles's landmark. They are placed in 1923 on the hills of Hollywood. It can be quite a drive to there, but the Griffith observatory is a good spot for pictures with beautiful views of the city as a bonus. Just take the picture and go....nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972

50,Horse Ride -Best View of LA!!!!,"The closest you can actually get to view famous Hollywood sign is about 150 ft to enjoy a quick viewing from the "" back side "" of large letters. Located @ top of steep small mountain road is protected 24/7 by amazing surveillance technology & law enforcement personal; but well worth the effort !!!Advice: closest foot-hike after parking @ top of North Beachwood Canyon (same dirt parking for Sunset Ranch).I always enjoy me visiting to this historic location via my Privately owned horses ( note: some horse rental barns (LA Equestrian District on Burbank/ Glendale) side of mountain might guide you on rental horses safety w/ advance notice of ur desired location/ duration of horse lease ... with a proper gratuity because you are guided by pro-cowboys from Mexico always keeping you safe during this 10mile round-trip private horse-ride on dirt & paved trails!Always peaceful w/stunning views of LA & SFValley & Pacific Ocean.Fact: Griffith Park is the largest city park in USA!!! Fact: the best 360* view of Los Angeles either via private helicopter charter; or is a long hike and/or private horse ride up to the top of Mt. Hollywood......I've been blessed to experience this life changing beauty & history many times for over 20years.... if you love horses & visiting LA...... put this @ top of sightseeing list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373millicents
40,Nice to view from afar.,"Feel free to look up at the sign from miles away, but don't try to go up there, u will only end up getting yourself in trouble with the law!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lapdjames
40,Did view from close to the hills from a street,A view from a street close to the foothill and also while driving up to the Griffiths observatory. If you do want to go up the hill to reach the Hollywood sign you need to trek which would have been quite tiring in the hot sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YathienderS
50,Crazy hike!!,"My sister and I hiked this trail in the morning through the sunset ranch trail. On our way up to the Hollywood sign there were horse droppings so we had to step around that but no problem!! We saw a couple of horses on our way up and they were the cutest. We were out of breath about 20 minutes into the trail but that's probably because we are out of shape haha. There are a lot of people that hike the trail so be cautious when heading near the Hollywood sign as there are steep cliffs with no railings. I think I saw someone driving a minivan on that hike as well so be careful they don't run you off the canyon. The sign itself is protected by a gate, and there are cameras surrounding the area. I think when we were up there someone tried to hop the fence and touch the sign and a voice on a speaker asked him to step away from the sign and move back to the gate because he was trespassing. Once you get behind the sign though, the view of L.A. is breathtaking. So worth the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/victoriar437
40,Amazing view,Runyon Canyon Park is the best place to get an overview over the canyon (and valley) and the sign. Another opportunity are two small viewpoints (i.e. Hollywood Bowl Overlook) on Mulholland Dr.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hans750

50,Must do!,Seeing the Hollywood sign is obviously a must do when staying in Las Angeles! It was very exciting!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiarnaeg
50,We did it !,"You can not get very close to the sign. If you park at the observatory it is a fairly long hike ( approx 6.5 miles / 10 km ) in and out. We did this as a nice morning workout run. It was a little chilly, VERY windy that day. but it was still really cool to get to this iconic symbol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/871Pieter
50,Hike to Hollyweird Sign,"A few friends and I have been dying to see the Bat Caves (Bronson Caves) up near the Hollywood Sign, since the hike to those were so quick we also hiked up to the sign from Bronson Park (really nice). It was about a little less than 3 miles if you wanted to go behind the sign and in front, but oh man, stretch it out and be a little prepped for this hike. It was light moderate but it did feel like you were walking up hill almost the entire time. I loved it!! Even though it was overcast and kinda gloomy the views were still amazing. There was quite a few people on the trail, I didn't see very many if any kids on the trail as it might be too much for them. We got there close to noon and left just before they locked us in the park (thank goodness) I suggest going earlier if you are going to park in the park, or park on the street just before the park if you are going to take your time and picnic and stuff. Not much shade at all so bring sunblock or a hat. They do have the sign fenced in so, no you cannot touch it or get very close to it. I also brought my little Shih-poo and he did pretty well with the hike, but he did slow down on the way down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EkJones529
40,"""HOLLYWOOD SIGN""","The famous HOLLYWOOD sign is seen best from the walkway bridge in Hollywood Blvd, near theChinese Theatre.Also if you take a bus tour to the hill.You cannot get close or under it as it is securely blocked off....From the hill vantage point you can also see over LA, it's a spectacular sight....

40,Photo stop on Hollywood tours,"Until and unless you are really serious about viewing this iconic sign upclose you can catch it from far for a good photo from Griffith observatory or when they stop on the opposite hill during your Celebrity home or other Hollywood tours.Iconic and defining Hollywood , you dare not miss it if you visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UNNIMAYA
40,Iconic - hard to get up close,"Everyone needs a pic of the Hollywood sign on their first trip to LA. I highly recommend getting driving directions in advance or take a tour for the 'best' photo spot. Unless your an experienced hiker or plan in advance - don't attempt to walk - it's a whole lot further away than it looks. You may want to ""kill 2 birds with 1 stone"" and utilise the shuttle bus to the lookout at the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyH247
50,Hike to the sign,The hike up to the sign is incredible. Parking can be a challenge but well worth it. The hike is fairly easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stocway
40,Iconic symbol of LA and movies!,"In my experience city signs are bigger and nicer on TV than when you see them live. But the Hollywood sign really made an impact on me, I thought that the live sign was more impressive than any movie I've seen it in. I would recommend stopping by and taking a couple of pictures if you are visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jorgetL7331JR
30,Holly wood sign,The Hollywood sign is a long hike up a hill like at least a good hour maybe 2 depending on your speed. But when you get to the top it's still not worth it because as you may see on movies they sit on the Hollywood sign and go right in front of it. But no the sign is gated so I would suggest if you don't like walking to just take a picture of the sign from a far.,
20,This is an attraction?,"It is a large sign on a hill. Nothing more, nothing less. It was put up by a real estate developer in the 1920's and originally said ""Hollywoodland,"" the name of the development. Do you know there is no city named Hollywood in California? What is thought of as Hollywood is part of Los Angeles. There is a West Hollywood nearby, however. The Hollywood sign has blown down several times and locals raise the money to put it back up. In the 1050's through the 70's Los Angelenos used to gauge how smoggy it was by whether or not they could see it. Hooray for the Clean Air Act! You can see it every day now.",
30,nice to look at,"the sign is cool to see but that's all. nice view from Hollywood Blvd, Fun to see from Mullholland Drive",
40,"Nice sign, stands out from other city signs",This sign has more pizazz to it then Las Vegas's sign or any others. I've never seen graffit on it and is an iconic piece known worldwide.,
50,Hallmark of LA attraction,"The best point to take the picture of this sign is Griffith observatory. It's a must-to-see attraction for everyone who first comes to LA. By the sign location itself, there is no permission for tourists to accede near. So this view point is the best point to take picture with Hollywood sign.",
40,You hafta see the sign.,How can you go to LA and not see the Hollywood sign? There are many ways to go about it. My favorite is the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. (google it) Take Mulholland Dr. up to the overlook for a good view of the sign and the bowl. Not to mention the great houses on stilts you also get to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avrin2
40,Beatiful place!,"It was exciting to find the Hollywood Sign. Fist of all I drove to Hollywood Hills for a wrong place, by my mistake.

40,Fascinating,"This sign has so much fascinating history, did you know it was originally made of wood, and not meant to be permanent? Keep in mind that you will NOT get a good picture of this sign anywhere in LA and if you want a nice selfie, you'll be forced to go on a 5 hour hike through a tour company. There are also local transit buses that run which will take you up, but check the sites for operation hours and locations to catch them. Don't get talked into a 'walking tour with the best view of the sign' as you see from my pic. below, you can't even see it in the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846samanthaf

40,Vacation,You see the sign all the time on TV and when you get there it's just a humble experience even if it is far away it's still something that you have to see when you're there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jliquid
30,Iconic sign seen from Griffith Park,I feel a little guilty about an average rating but it is a sign and yes it is Iconic but it is still a sign. If Hollywood history is your thing then you may want to try to get a closer view but the view from the observatory at Griffith Park was great for me plus you can see so much more. I had a clear 90 degree day and the vantage point offered at this point is dramatic. My opinion this is a great way to view the Hollywood sign. Have fun and enjoy Griffith Park at the same time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
30,It's a sign....,"When in Rome...I visited the Hollywood sign because I was in Hollywood and it's the done thing. But really, it's just a sign. Maybe that's me.There is no parking and we hadn't left enough time to do a proper hike so eventually found somewhere to pull up, take photos and leave.I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again now that I have my photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieL784
30,Our view from horseback,We passed this whilst riding in the hills. It's a must see and there are a number of ways to reach it. It's best to take in whilst doing something else as a trip just to see the sign would be time wasted when there's so much else to see and do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/449kims
50,Hollywood baby,"Gees seen this place on TV so many time and it was fantastic to see it in real life. Driving up the hills to the sign gets hectic, the parking isn't very good and when there's 100's of cars trying to park up at the same time it took some time.Def go see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheffieldmiller
40,A dream sign for dream world,First thing you feel once you hear hollywood is this sign . You need to go on higher plane to see this via hiking or by tourist packages . Lovely feeling,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelspritua
40,Best place to see is at,best place to see sign is from Griffith observatory. You will also see the city of los angeles and the ocean in the distance. short drive up the mountain to view it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckS780
40,youre not getting to close to it.,"understand that it is a sign, youre not going to be able to touch it. The closest you will get will be the Griffith Observatory. Another good place to see it is the view point on Mulholland Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriskK4434CP
30,Sign from the Griffith Observatory,Google Maps took me to the Griffith Observatory to look at the sign. Not a good idea unless you have binoculars or a very good lens on your camera. Views of the sign from street level is better. Views of Los Angeles from the point where I was is however absolutely amazing. Beware the long and winding road though. And prepare for a huge crowd and no parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245henrym
30,Manage your expectations,"Uh, ok. I got as close to the sign as I could which was not very. I took pictures- you have to. Hollywood sign task complete.

50,LA Hiking at it's Finest,"For anyone visiting Los Angeles or even someone who's been here for a while, the Hollywood sign is A MUST. Not to be confused with other LA attractions where you can drive up to, this is a HIKING destination.You can always take a picture with the sign as a backdrop a mile away but if you want to get up close and personal and get one of the best views of the city, you have to put some work in. I would give it about 30 minutes from the bottom to the sign or you can go on one of the horse rides which still don't take you to the top.However as mentioned if you want to get as close as possible (the thing is surrounded by White House status fencing) you have to hike. Always beautiful always a great date or daily hiking trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hovikm74
30,Popular landmark,"The Hollywood sign is a popular landmark and cultural icon standing 45 feet tall in the Santa Monica Mountains.

30,It's just a sign!,"I, like all other first time visitors to Hollywood made a special point to see ""the sign"" The good news (I guess) is that it was very easy for us to see from multiple areas we visited.

30,Saw From A Distance-Story about the Suicide,"Was on a Dearly Departed Tour and the van stopped in the middle of Hollywood Blvd. giving us a view of the sign from quite a distance between two buildings. Could clearly see the sign and then heard the story of the suicide of the lady who jumped off the ""H"" several years ago and killed herself. They found her in the gully below a couple days later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnTheRoadAgain1056

50,Awesome,"Always wanted to see the sign and manage to do it twice! First time we went to Griffiths Observatory and was thrilled to just see this iconic sign away in the distance and then purely by chance whilst driving at the bottom of the hills we had a perfect view of it as we drove up towards it. Managed to stop no problem and get pictures. Stunned how small it was as to our expectations. But hey, another one ticked off that bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatrickM79

20,"Pictures are more interesting than the actual site!If you are Driving, do not waste your time.","We left Vegas on a tour bus and this was our next to our last stop. The sign is famous yet not very well cared for.Some new paint and a few repairs needed. All I can relate about this ""attraction"" is that it was on the tour agenda. The remainder took in many interesting sites and overall I would recommend the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prets38

30,"It's a sign, not the Eiffel Tower! I don't get it.","Good view but there are plenty of good views in LA, so I don't quite get the fascination with this particular hike. Maybe I'm PO'ed because I got a parking ticket on Beachwood and got yelled at by the owner of the cafe when I tried to use the rest room. Be prepared for that, btw. No bathrooms. No drinking water. It's just a residential neighborhood where the locals are famous for hating tourists. I didn't have a problem with them, just the cafe owner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squirrelhillave
50,what's to say,"If you are in Hollywood, you have to see this sign. Either up close by hiking or from other vantage spots. What else can you say?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelaa29
50,Well its a sign,For a sign its very famous and can be seen from many areas looks great all lit up at night. I took a few pictures of it the best from Mulholland drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieandJane
30,Distant,"We visited one afternoon. Traffic was crazy. We queued most of the way up to the Griffith Observatory only to be turned away as the car park was full. We had to drive quite a way down the road to find a place to park at the side of the road.We then walked up to the Griffith Observatory to take pictures of the Hollywood sign. When we got to the observatory the sign looked tiny ‚Äì it was way in the distance.I felt quite underwhelmed. I know you can‚Äôt get too close to the sign, but I hadn‚Äôt realised exactly how far away it would be.If you want to go to tick a box, go. If you want to see the sign close up, I wouldn‚Äôt bother.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiciaW
40,Truly an icon of the area!,"We climbed a hill overlook for a clear shot of the sign. This was the only thing my 7 year old grandson asked of me: ""Please take a photo of the Hollywood sign!""---so I did!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/margaretmI9666TA
40,Great hike but long,"We started at the observatory and it was around 10 km or 6 miles return. The hike there is pretty much all up hill, and then back is down hill. Bring lots of water, especially if it's a hot day as you're gone for a while. It was definitely worth the hike to get some good pictures but at the end of the day it's just a sign. When we flew home, we went by it in the plane and that was cool. One of those things that you just have to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/klein3
50,Hollywood sign hike,"I finally checked this hike off my list! The main deterrent that kept delaying my attempt was not being too sure where to begin the hike.My friend and I parked on N Beachwood Dr. by the old Hollywoodland entrance. Street parking (not metered) is available but VERY LIMITED. As you get closer to the gate entrance, it is all permit parking and saw several cars with tickets for those who didn't have the proper permit. Aside from permit parking, the only other way to park at/near the gate is if you are going horseback riding. There is a security guard at the gate for those who think they can easily sneak in to skim off that extra 10 minutes.The total distance from where we parked to the top and back was 8.5km (5.28 mi) and took 1h 50 min with many photo stops.The incline heading up can a challenge for some, especially on a hot day. Some may find the horse poop on the trails as an extra challenge but as long as you can avoid the obvious fresh stuff, you're golden.Once you reach the top (indicated by the American flag), the views are great. One one side, you overlook Burbank, Toluca Lake and Universal City. The money shot is on the other side when you see the top of the HOLLYWOOD sign, see Downtown Los Angeles and get a unique view of the Hollywood Reservoir. On a clear day, you can see as far as Long Beach, Rancho Palos Verdes and San Pedro.A definite hike to add to the list but due to convenience, won't be a frequent one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadamVeuve

50,Hike Mount Hollywood for a great of the sign and LA,Went up here to get a closer look at Griffith observatory and decided to hike the mt Hollywood trail. It's about 3miles in total and not overly steep for the duration. We went about 930am and it was so peaceful and its well worth it for the views!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatalieL357
50,Iconic sign,You can see the Hollywood sign from many vantage points across LA. One of the best places - especially if you want a photo - is from LACMA - LA County Museum of Art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari0nP
50,Worth the hike,Walked up to the top of the Hollywood sign.Whilst the walk can be challenging in places for those not of a reasonable fitness due to both the weather and steepness the view from the top makes it worth the hike.A must do every time we return to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6050QUnicks

30,hollywood Sign,"well what can anybody say about looking at a sign. Once you've seen it then its done. To be honest I found it more exciting viewing the sign itself from the roads driving around LA. Its certainly iconic and well worth being able to say that you have seen it. But there is nothing about the viewing points that makes the trip special. Best to view from Adobe centre at Hollywood Boulevard then the two can be done together, that way you get the vibe from the area too which is certainly apparent at Hollywood boulevard and a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliesH1095VY
50,More than a landmark,"I really had a very nice time visiting the sign.

50,Iconic Must See,"Pretty hard to miss the sign in Hollywood Hills above the city! We learned there had been quite a few changes to this sign over the years and when the last damage occurred, even in the times of budget crunch, businesses contributed over a quarter million dollars to restore the sign. This sign would be sorely missed if it was gone. It is a symbol of another life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CyndyandByron

40,Didn't have time to visit the sign close up,We only had a brief stay in LA but obviously wanted to see the iconic sign. It was great to see it as we drove towards the Hollywood walk of fame. There is a small shopping mall area on the walk and if you go up a couple of levels you get a great view of the sign. If you have a good camera you should get some good pictures here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orlando2010

40,LA's icon,"I'm with Sonya W - why bother hiking when you can drive relatively close and see what you came to see - once you've done it, you wonder why you bothered but for many it is the icon that defines Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
30,Best seen from Griffith observatory,"Not big at all, and not what I was expecting but it was nice to see and of course it an be combine with the Griffith observatory. Only seen in the day - it is not illuminated at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonS918

50,Save yourself the hassel...,"and view from the hills of the Griffith park. Residents have signs stating you can't see the sign from their street, but they are liars. Drive up past their overpriced houses and view from a distance. Save the hassel of hiking to the sign.",
30,June Gloom,The lack of tourist signage partnered with the gloomy mist meant that we struggled to get to a vantage point. We rode up and down the spaghetti road network with no luck. Roadworks and Private roads create a difficult area to travel around. For a landmark as famous as this there should be simpler access measures.,
50,Hike to the back of the sign,"Hiked from the trail entry to the back of the Hollywood sign - approx 3km. A little challenging in sections. Majority sealed and well marked. Options to take longer track from the Observatory.Breath-taking views across LA as you climb. Spotted plenty of bird life, interesting flora and even saw a coyote at the top of Mt Hollywood.Best down early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat of the day as most of the walk is done in open unshaded areas.Totally enjoyable and a great sense of achievement at the top. We came down around the front and ended up on Mulholland Dve, where we were able to call an uber to pick us up.",
40,Famous 9-letter sign,"A few years ago, this famous sign looked a bit bedraggled and in need of some care. This time we noticed it seemed like it got some fresh paint. Looked better and could be seen farther away. Still so nice to see it in person and get some photos of those famous 9 letters!",
40,Fun had finding best view.,"Griffith Park where the sign sits is a great place to explore.We have fun doing trails in the park to find the best view of the sign. We found in the end, the best view was on 'caynon lake drive'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxMs83

40,How close can you go?!?!,So here's the big question. Where can we go to see up close the Hollywood sign.. well it's not at Hollywood and Highland. The best spot is on Gower. If you're on Hollywood Blvd go east on Hollywood Blvd then make a right in Gower. Keep going north in Gower until you hit Franklin. Cross over Franklin and you'll see more up close and as clear as it can be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaindl

50,Amazing,"Traveled all the way from San Diego to LA just to see the sign, need an uber to go and see but well worth seeing",
30,Fun to see From Afar - No Need To Drive UP,"The ""Hollywoodland"" sign (that now just says ""Hollywood"") is clearly a world wide recognized sign and part of Los Angeles history and lore. However, truth be known, drive by from a freeway or street and get a look - it's all you need. Taking the time and making the effort to get closer is generally disappointing to anyone but a real ""sign fan."" Worth seeing; not worth any extra effort.",
50,Awesome way to see the city,This was a great walk to do. It took us about 2 hours to get there and back with a few obligatory photos. Our shoes got pretty dusty as it was quite dry. I am fair skin and had sun cream on but did still get a bit burnt around my shoulders. Take plenty of water as you are in the sun and it can be warm. Great walk to domm,
40,A steep climb to see an estate agents sign... but a must,Driving up the hill to the Hollywood sign is one of the must see signs in the world. The road winds around and up through a residential area. Unfortunatly as we near the top the road to get nearer is closed due to fire but managed to get the classic phtoto and one with me A good day out,
30,"Must-see, but it's hard to find a great place for pictures","I'm a photographer, so when I went to LA, the Hollywood sign was a must-have picture. Once we actually found a place to take the picture, it was really cool, but it took a long time to find ""the spot"" to take it and then to find parking to actually get close enough.**Don't park in the windy neighborhoods leading up to it. There are police officers on parking patrol CONSTANTLY circling the neighborhoods and you WILL get a ticket.",

No, you don't need to do it more than once in your life. Walking through Griffith Park or hiking the Hollywood trail or the trail up and down to the Observatory is far more interesting and rewarding...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRealGelatoGirl
40,Iconic & Great Backdrop For a Selfie!,I took my family to the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and then to dinner at a nearby mall. We realized that we could see the Hollywood sign when we were leaving the Japanese restaurant. It was so cool. My children and their cousins took selfies with the sign in the background. It was a fun free moment!,
30,Its the traditional sign you see in the movies.,its a great icon for Hollywood. But They sign is great but. The state of California should be ashamed of themselves as to how bad they have allowed their streets to get. I am not talking about traffic that was bad enough but the worst part is the cracks; pot holes; divots in their road my wife and I driving was bouncing everywhere and my tires would all of a sudden want to turn right because here on the left side is way higher then the right forcing the tires to move towards the right. This is all in the main city of Hollywood area. I felt ashamed taking my wife down these roads for a nice romantic trip/night out.,
40,View it from Griffith park and the observatory.,Don't go just to see this. Go to Griffith park and the observatory. See it from there and get more for your time.,
30,"Yep, it's a sign on a hill","Ok, it's a famous sign on a hill, visible from a number of different places, but I wouldn't make a special trip to see just that. If you're on Hollywood Boulevard climb the parking garage stairs to the open walkway by the Christmas decorations store and get a good clear view.",
50,Surreal!,Though not very close but still! You just have to go to the dog's park to get the best view without having to hike for long hours! The picture attached is not zoomed in but we got a pretty much good background of the sign üòÅ,
50,It is just good to see - that should be the extent of expectation,"It is just curiously satisfying to see - from wherever that should happen to be. Seeing it gives a brief flutter of connection and excitement, and I think that is all we should expect from it. It's a landmark icon, with a sentimental attachment to many.We saw it from multiple points - all had their merits. Just enjoy it for what it is - don't have to touch it or stand up on top of it to experience it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter

50,Best photo opportunity,Go to Griffith Observatory to get the Hollywood sign views especially at sunset. The Outlook area near the Hollywood Bowl is not as good and the Observatory is fascinating. According to our guide you can't get more than 300 metres to the sign itself by State law due to people messing around with the letters!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Insearch0fadventure
40,"Overrated , can't get to it .","Good. To see , but the question remains , where is the best place to view it ?

50,Awesome views great hike,My family and I did the hike to the top of the Hollywood sign. There was plenty of Parking right before the trail. If you are not in good shape the hike up can be tough. But once closer to the top the incline was better. Have good shoes especially for the hike down. The horses were cool. I would do that again next time. I have lived in LA and have never done the hike but glad I did. Beautiful,
30,Don't waste precious holiday minutes,"Please don't be one of those people who just has to get close to the sign. You have to walk up to it, and honestly it really wasn't worth it. Just go to Griffith Park and the Observatory, it's a lot easier and at least you get an attraction out of it too.",
40,A must see while visiting LA!!,"We drove up to Lake Hollywood Park (it is a drive up the mountains but very worth it)!!We were able to see the sign very clearly and we were as close as possible without owning property in the area! If you want the best view to take pictures, this is it!!",
30,Take a picture and move on,"If you are going to Hollywood, you can't pass the Hollywood sign. Amazing? No. Special? I don't know. You can take a nice picture from Hollywood and Highland in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/643lucb

30,Its Great To See But......,"Its really busy all the time and hard to get near, we hired a car and still found it a nightmare, the amount of people constantly visiting take from the actual thrill of seeing it, All that said some fantastic views of the valley below but remember you will not get anywhere near enough to touch the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ericskine
20,Not as close as you think,"We drove to the observatory thinking we could get a good picture from there but in fact you need to hike 4.1 miles from there to get any where near.On a hot day this is not doable for a normal tourist.And even when do hike it, you're no where near it.Just zoom in if you need to take a photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kikadez
30,Too hard to find!,"Not clearly marked how to find it. Even though I checked tripadvisor for best view, it must have been old directions because it could not be seen.

30,you can see it from a distance,We saw the sign at the mall on Hollywood and vine but it was a lot further away than I thought. It was worth seeing will seeing the wax museums and hollywood walk of fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodneyj339

50,Wow! The sign that dreams are made of,"Lived in East Hollowood area my entire life. Never had a day without this incredible iconic sign. Put up in the 20's to advertise a houseing development called ""Hollywoodland"". The sign is best seen by not driving through Hollywoodland. To many cars , people and locals who have had enough of the tourists.A great 2 fer is to see the sign via Lake Hollywood. Take a beautiful walk or bike around the lake and see downtown Hollywood and the Best view of the sign.Plenty of parking and no angry locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevindW3969LT

40,One off the Bucket List... bring binoculars!,"A definite for the Bucket List - tho' mainly for the memories from lovely films this sign brings to mind. Enjoy for what it's worth.

Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy_Luv2

30,I guess it depends on where you view from,"We went to Griffith Park Observatory to get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign, which was one of the recommended places to see this from in its full glory! To be honest, with LA traffic we ended up getting to the observatory after dark which was a real bummer as the sign is not lit up, and therefore was so hard to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VixandPete

50,Hollywood,Seeing the Hollywood sign was part of a tour. We got to take pictures and we were the only ones there which was nice. Beautiful area. It was nice to see something we've only seen in movies.,
40,Good view,learned from the tour guide who placed the sign Hollywood... it has a nice view and would come back and actually have a photo of it somewhere close... we were driving around so no time really to do that...,
30,Be wary,All the Hollywood tour companys advertise that their tour includes the Hollywood sign; they don't!You will get long distance shot of it but no where near it.However you can get there but it will involve a tough trek by foot from Griffith Observatory.So before you get too excited about it do your homework.,
50,Part of Hollywood history,The sign is still there and easy to see. It's a must-see when in the Hollywood area. Very visible and lots of places take a picture.,
40,LA LA LA LA HOLLYWOOD!!!,"Visited the Hollywood sign during our Griffith Observatory visit and it was pretty cool. You can't get a great photo with its distance, but worth the experience to say, you did this, saw it!! Check it out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elsers1923

50,main attraction for my wife,"my wife is from Thailand and when asked what she wanted to see in LA she said the Hollywood sign, ended up being a cheap date just taking a drive to the observatory and walking the grounds for free. everyone in the world knows the Hollywood sign and is probably a main attraction to the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WIWIandBRAD
30,Fresh air? Not.,"One of the most striking things about making the effort to get close to the sign is the view looking away from the sign, in any direction. Pollution! Yes, you have been sucking in all that grime. If you want to delude yourself, then make the trip into the hills after rain or a windy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler

40,OKAY SO ITS A SIGN BUT...,The Hollywood sign is more of something you want to see because of how it has been made famous by the movie industry. There is nothing special about it other than 'it's the Hollywood Sign'. To take it to the next level go up to Griffiths Park to see the sign. You get so much more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Must See,you can't go to California and not go see this sign. the best place to catch the most scenery is the Griffith observatory. the entrance is free and from there you can hike closer to the sign. Vitaly the YouTube prankster climbed the sign but please don't do that it's on private land.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariovU1536HV
40,"Lovely, could do with being closer though!",Was nice to see and take photos of but as it was so far away was hard to get a good shot with it in the background. Nice attraction to witness though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hubblesr
50,I never get tired of seeing this landmark,"No matter where I travel in LA, I always love seeing this landmark. You can't get near it anymore, but you can hike up to within about 300 ft of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuLo1965
30,Too far away,I was surprised that you cannot get closer to the sign. We were probably 3-5 miles from it. There are no roads actually leading up to the sign which is probably good as there would be graffiti all over it if it was more accessible. This is one thing that is really a must if you are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLE0904
30,Hollywood Sign - Is that it?,"We only had 2 days in LA, so thought we better do the iconic sightseeing of the Hollywood sign, went up to viewing point on Hollywood and Vine, underwhelmed by the whole experience, but at least we got photos to say we saw the sign, it's probably not worth the time, but one of those things you will probably regret if you don't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MakingMemories72
30,Cool from a distance...,Unfortunately you can't get to the Hollywood sign without illegally trespassing. But cool sight from afar. Be-careful during evening times. You'll see alot of undesirables there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymesp2016
40,Fun thing to do!,Everyone knows the Hollywood sign and the hike was not disappointing. It was not difficult and a fun walk with the kids.Definitely some good photo ops!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleDawn
50,This is just big letters on the hill,"Yes, and you can't move directly to these letters because this place surrounded by a fence for security. So this is better to take a place on nearest hill and this is better to view letters but not climbing on them.Together you receive a full view of LA! Straight from beginning to... no, you've never can see the end of LA :))",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelTricker
40,Iconic,I got a nice picture from Griffith Observatory. If you are in LA get a picture just because you never know.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/31chastityd
40,Has to be done!,"Best place to view it from is 3387 Deronda Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90068, which I learned from other Trip Advisor members. It's worth the drive to say you've done it but you can get pictures from various other places if you google best places to view! Griffith Observatory or the Griffith Dog Park were also good recommendations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolesheehan
20,Hard to get close,"We saw the sign from several viewpoints but found it difficult to find a great place to get close for a picture of this famous landmark.To be honest it's just a sign but it's what it stands for..... we were in HOLLYWOOD baby!Kids thought I was crazy spending so much time trying to locate a good view.Oh well I have a photo, that's all I was after but I think it's an opportunity that has gone lacking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307JodieS
50,Miles high up but worth the view,Multiple attempts to hike up to the Hollywood sign and we finally made it to the top. The trail we did started from where the Bronson caves are at and it's probably <10 miles and almost 4 hours of hiking. It has a well defined dusty and dirt terrain trails. I would think it's moderate level of a hike. The view from the top... the back of the Hollywood sign. It's a well fenced and camera monitored area so beware. Pack up some snacks and water and you should be fine.P.sDon't forget the Bronson caves... it is cool for your selfies lol.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Olecram2017
20,Totally disappointed.....,"Not at all what I expected...We had to search to find it, always thought it was imposing and would get that WOW factor but sadly not!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyDubai1
50,Awesome!!!,We decided to take a drive up to the Hollywood sign if you are in Hollywood please take the time to go see it up close. The view is incredible!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pattilanerie
30,H O L L Y W O O D,"Expect narrow winding roads to get a photo of the sign, roads are high up in the hills with very tight corners and steep hills. If you're not very confident in your rental car don't bother! It's a free attraction obviously but don't expect to get up close to it. Worth doing",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3883SJdaveh
50,A great view,It has a great view. The road to get to the sign is beautiful. Nice place to take pictures. There is just the sign to see it so don't wait more than that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariadnabf
50,Let the sign shine,"Just got back to London from our first visit to LA and had a wonderful four night stay at the Loews Hollywood hotel where we had a superb view of the iconic Hollywood sign from our suite on the 17th floor. It's such a shame it does not get lit up anymore, apparently it used to but LA wanted to discourage sightseers visiting late at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrackingJohn
40,"Nothing great, but must see.",You can see it from multiple locations. Brings out the nostalgia of seeing it in multiple movies.Best view from Hollywood Highland Mall Level 4 balcony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S_Biks
40,Iconic Sign,"Why review what is just a sign. Because it is more than a sign it is the icon of the film industry. You can't come to Tinseltown without seeing it. Even for an old cynic like me it still has the ""Wow"" factor",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saint100
30,The Hollywood,"It's been my third trip to see/show someone else the sign with me, every time I get to see it from a different distance/direction as it's harder and harder to find an easy access for a close up picture :)It's just a sign, part of the history I guess and big deal for people all over the world so no matter what I say you will still end up going there and taking a picture.TIP: Now that the streets that led to the closest point of contact with the sign are closed for thru traffic your best bet is to go by the lake/Beachwood Canyon - it's a free parking spot and a great background for a good pictureTIP: be careful while driving in those small streets if you aren't coming directly from the lake's side (for the non-locals you, as myself, I had to rely on the GPS so you really don't know which way you are going other than following the directions that lead through a lot of crazily tight streets/corners/curves)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reedmangreg
50,Hollywood sign,"To get a really good photo of it. Hollywood Blvd shopping centre ,- floor up. Easier to get a good shot than driving up yo the Hollywood hills and trying to get a photo even on most days the smog makes it very difficult to obtain that one good shot.Well worth seeing .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128lynettea
40,What a hike,"Planned to do this hike in the morning but ended up doing it at mid day. so hot and need to take plenty of water. You cannot get very close too the sign, the trial either goes to the top on the hill, so you are high above and behind it or you are in front of it but fairly far away. We saw it from both angles but when you are on top of the hill the scene of LA below are breath-taking so do try to do this option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14Notts
30,Don't try to drive up to it,Can be seen from numerous places. We first notice it whilst having a coffee outside Starbucks at Hollywood and Highland (Dolby Theatre). When we set our sat nav we had an interesting drive through narrow streets and quaint housing but found access blocked even though there was a good view from where we ended up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aintree9
30,Meh....,"Its a sign on a hill, you've seen t in so many movies be a shame not to see it in real life....go up to Griffiths Observatory, good view and you kill two attractions in one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wazza99
40,Great to see in real life,"Enjoyed seeing this in the flesh, there are trails to walk and get a closer view but we found an area called 'Lake Hollywood Park' a green area under the sign you can drive to and get great pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kev977
50,Had to see it!,"We were excited to see the iconic sign! I'm not sure of all the ways to get closer, but our main views and photo ops were from the grounds of Griffith Observatory. A quick view is satisfactory, or have a picnic lunch and ponder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliathegr82

50,Iconic Must See when in California,"I loved seeing the iconic Hollywood sign! We did a short hike from Griffith Park and then drove through a neighborhood recommended by a local to get a better view. You can't get that close to it, but it's definitely worth seeing when in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY3032
40,Best view is from Griffith Observatory,The Hollywood sign is a free attraction that is the iconic symbol of Hollywood itself. The best uninterrupted view of it is from The Griffith Observatory which is also free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tripinator146
50,Distant but amazing!,We could see the sign from our hotel room in Hollywood and never got boring to look at! Shame it isn't lit up at night,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurenTucker1994
40,Hollywood!!,You have to see it but it's nothing special. Get a picture whilst doing something else around LA. You can drive quite close but you can't get right up to it so just enjoy from a distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laura0609b
50,Hollywood Sign Hike,"Experience Glamour Hiking at its finest! There's a hiking trail that leads from the base up the horse trail and behind the mountain with awesome sights of the valley. Then it loops back to the front and you're over the hollywood sign! Great vantage point for photos and a view of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow
40,Best viewed from Griffith Park,It is a must to get a good view and the best is probably from the Observatory in Griffith Park.Interesting history as it was originally there to advertise a development that never happened!Very iconic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DuncanP_12
30,Not visible at night,"It is big and fabulous but you cannot see it during nigh time. It should be lighted in someway so people can see it, it should be a great attraction at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mab0828
30,its just a sign folks!,"Looks run down and seedy, but has finally been cleaned up a bit. The power lines behind it makes its charm even more hard to find. Still can't figure out the attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4420XLeileenc
30,Try and catch the view on the way to somewhere else !!,It's a sign you've seen a million times in the movies. You can't get close and to be honest after 5 minutes you realise ..That's it .. it's just a sign..!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dizzydisney
40,Cultural Icon,"You can't come to LA without looking at the Hollywood Sign. The history is also interesting and the view is great. We looked today from the top of Mulholland Drive, which requires a car and a walk up steps, but there are a number of easier vantage points in the Hollywood Hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LateBloomer69
30,Hollywood Hills Sign!,"It's a bird! It's a plane! Oh wait, it is just white letters spelling out Hollywood.That's pretty much it. You can get decent views from the surrounding area and from the 101. But you can't get very close. You can hike up near there but not actually onto the property. It's a neat sign and very iconic. I was super excited when I first saw it, then it was quickly over. I wouldn't go out of your way to catch a glimpse, but it was neat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dazyabbey
30,Have to have a photo but it is just a sign,Best place to get a photo of the sign without having to wander around is the Griffith Observatory but go before 1000 to get a parking space. Observatory opened at 1200 so did not go in which was slightly disappointing but sign photo box ticked. Good views of the city which is a bonus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/936DaveW
40,Long Hike from Griffith Observatory,"Completed underestimated how long this would take us, not sure we took the most efficient route.From Griffith Observatory this hike probs took us 2 hrs to get to the sign. Great scenery, glad we did it in the morning as it gets HOT during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikailao
50,Finally I saw it,"In 2004 we didn't have Siri to give us directions.2016 we do so Siri got us up onto the mountain look across on to the other mountain or should I say Hollywood Hill. And there was an all it's white wooden planks Hollywood. But hey folks it's an iconic sign, and who doesn't want to say oh yeah I've seen the Hollywood sign. So just remember Hooray for Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewels48162

50,The Famous Hollywood Sign,A big tick off my bucket list as I always wanted to see the sign. However you need a good zoom in lense to get a good pictures of it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mock101
40,This is a proper trail to the summit of a mountain,It's a fair trek in hot heat. You can wear trainers but walking boots really should be worn. Park below the beechwood cafe. Eat something in there and buy water at least a litre in the mini market beside. If your finding it tough go to the front they sell cold drinks just thru the gate to the left. Trek to the rear of the letters is steeper and adds two miles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carnalbanagh
40,Iconic,"Indeed a tourist spot. For those who are in LA, you need to stop by and get some pictures taken here. It's free. There's not much view, but still worthy of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bornok_30
40,Nice walk / hike,We parked at the observatory and walked to the bottom of the sign. The walk / hike is just over 4 miles on paved roads and tracks. Take water with you as you can't get any on the route. No toilets / restrooms on the trail at all. It's a nice weak for a nice view of the sign and of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesUK-USA
50,Great Landmark,"When driving in Hollywood, take a look up into the hillside and you will see this classic sign. I was amazed the first time I saw it in person -- and every time I visit LA, I try and make a point to see it ... it still gives me a thrill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshapiro99
30,The view of it from Muholland street,"It was neat to see but not very close and hard to get a good picture. Also, Not much parking!! Maybe 6 cars. And we parked along the side of the street, left the car for 5 minutes to take a picture, came back to a policeman giving everyone tickets. Very pricey too!! Considered a red zone! $100.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBLOVER2014

40,There it is! Just like in the movies...,Not too much to do but SEE the HOLLYWOOD sign in person. Some closer views show how impressively BIG the letters actually are. (You really can't get near them... fenced off.) But lots of places to catch a good look. Mostly just to say you did!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arthotelpatron
40,Wear trainers!,"It's a really nice hiking area, lots of inclines and pathways to enjoy, but you must remember to wear some decent trainers. I parked in the Griffith Observatory parking area and went on the shorter trail up Mt. Hollywood. It was busy and very dusty, but the reward was a great view of the sign. On the return, the public restrooms were non-functional at the observatory, so it was a hasty walk back down to the lower carpark where the loos were operational... Still a great thing to do (3 hours)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardbB6517AU
40,Just because there is only one of these in the world,I know it is only a sign but it is on the other hand the Hollywood sign. Having seen it on tv and commercials so many times it was great to see it in real life. A quick drive by is honestly enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnC14887
40,Cool to see in person for the first time.,"There's a great view of it from Griffith Observatory, where we already were. There are trails to hike to it, but we didn't get do that. If you're in the area, you should go to Griffith Park and Observatory, and while there you may as well turn around and check out the iconic sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114sama
50,Great hike,"Who never dreamt of hiking to the Hollywood sign ?Awesome activity to do in the morning when the air isn't so hot, you can park your car just at the beginning of the hiking trail, then about 1 hour slowly hike you will arrive in a place you can take unforgettable pictures with the sign in background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elodiew408

50,Hollywood Walk of Fun,"A great way to get some gentle hiking while in LA. The iconic sign visit is a worthwhile way to spend an early part of the morning in the city. I like to walk up there before it gets too hot. Lots of friendly people, some walking their dogs, it's one more way to connect with the joy of nature while living in the city. Highly recommend for visitors to Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LosAngeleslotus

50,Great hike!,"I actually did hike to the Hollywood sign. Be prepared with water, snacks and comfortable clothes. I forget to bring water and At the end it was like a survival hike üòÇ it's a long hike, you will walk through cement and dirt. Not so many people here, compare to other hikes around.

50,Ok!,"Visiting the Hollywood sign is just a big hype only because of all the movies etc... so I must say its a definite ""must go"" if you are ever in the area. I went the extra mile or should I say MILES and went on a hike to see it way more up close than from the hills..that's more worth it for me if you are a first timer! Aside from that its a great hike and workout to get there so it's a win win if you're into hiking and exercising. If you are not I advise RIGHT NOW not to take the hike to see it more up close! Your legs will feel like noodles once you're done lol everytime I visit I do end up taking the hike only because I love hiking. üòâ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aracely130

40,Yes!,I went to the Griffith Observatory--you get a good view from their parking lot. It is what it is--an iconic symbol of Hollywood. Glad I finally got to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lecterit
50,Sightseeing,We had a horrible woman who cussed at us while we took pictures. She made it a point to say she lived there and we were not welcome. We blocked no one and parked legally... that was the thumbs down part of the visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lizziwizzi90

30,Nice walk with the views,"We went from Hollywood central and got an √ºber just to where we ran out of gps, walked as close as we wanted to and it was very tranquil, the village down from the sign is such a lovely part of Hollywood, and all the houses have such a unique build to them. Lovely idyllic location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AAPaul1972
50,Amazing close up!,"We drove up to the highest point that we could reach by car it was a bit crowded and being controlled by police services but we had a great time nonetheless. We were driving alongside Jay Leno on the road that leads up to the sign, so that was exciting lol",
50,A Must!,First time in California and hiked the trails to get a good look at the Hollywood sign. There are lots of trails for all skill levels which is great because no one should miss out on this experience!,
50,Plenty of places to view,There are tons of places to view the sign. The best place to view it is the Griffith Observatory. Neat to see.,
40,Hurrah for Hollywood,"This is an Iconic sign - from its 1920's Hollywoodland hills real-estate advertising beginnings to the Hollywood Icon fame of today, to see this sign is a somewhat surreal experience; getting access to viewing this sign is the real challenge. There is no access to the Hollywood sign - my understanding that it is illegal to do so; moreover, it is trespassing to approach the area of and near to the sign. There are a couple of advertised designated viewing areas; one such site is the Griffith Park Observatory; this route to access the observatory hill is traffic mayhem and a parking hell. There must be times when the popularity of viewing from this observatory area is less chaotic but August 2016 was not it.Take Canyon Drive off Franklin Ave towards the Bronson Caves - there is no access beyond the gates on Canyon Drive; but, there are parking areas either side of the road. Walk up the road towards the Bronson Caves then there is an accessible trail just before the first Cave entrance - this trail will give you an excellent photo op of the Hollywood sign. There is security at the gate and access to the Caves - walk up - your vehicle is not welcome up the cave access road. Wear appropriate footwear - flipflops are not. Caution: Fire danger is extreme in California this year.",
50,Historic,"If you want to see it, it's there. Other than being able to say ""hey, I've been there!""... there's not much to it.",
50,Have to visit it at least once in your lifetime,"Make sure you have your comfy walking shoes cause it's a hike. CAUTION plan your hike down accordingly. From sunset, you have 45 minutes to get back down before it's really dark. Depending your time of day, take a flashlight.All that said, this is one of the best places to catch subset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263marlenep

50,Wow,"We took our pictures from the Griffiths Observatory. I would definitely recommend to leave early to do battle with the I5 and battle with hikers and tourists alike!We literally used the 5 minute drop off parking bays to take our pics as the car park and the roads leading up to the Observatory are rammed!!We didn't walk to the sign, we high tailed it out of there and hit the Citadel outlets",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AK47Northampton
50,Great hike!,"We parked way down the hill, below the residential area to begin the hike. Due to the extra distance to the trailhead from parking, the total hike to the top of the sign, round trip, is roughly 5 miles. Great views, and while the actual sign is fenced off from hikers, it's well worth the trip. Pretty much consistent uphill the entire way in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DDStovall
40,Has to be seen,"On a visit to Los Angeles, we took a tour bus which takes you all around the different sites of the city, and of cause the Hollywood sign on the mountainside is one that has to been seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rppz

50,Best View - Free and Easy,"Get your sat nav, set it too 3000 Canyon Lake Drive. It's free, easy to get too and has great views of The Hollywood Sign.We've been to LA every year since 2006 and only just found this. We've spotted and photographed the sign from the Vista on Mulholland, the shopping centre at Hollywood and Highland, Griffiths Observatory. Canyon Lake Drive is by far the best and its free.My advice if your coming in from the UK: Europe basically the east, use the jet lag... Get up early and catch the sunrise .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y3240QPmarkb
50,If in LA worth the effort to see,"Visiting friends in LA this was a must to do. You cannot get right up to the sign these days and the roads right at the very top are blocked off with people stopping going further, they will even move you on if you stop your car to take a picture. We we lucky that friends drove us up there, dropped us off, went back down the hill and came back 5 mins later to pick us up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1506YKjohnt
40,Must See,Can't get super close but good view from Griffith Observatory! Must see if you are in Hollywood to add to your adventures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db16
30,Its a sign,It was fun to take a photo and say we'd seen the sign. Dissapointing that you can no longer walk right up to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lcasey45
30,Not worth the drive,"Drove up Beverley Hills to get a closer look at the Hollywood sign. I believe if you are not up for trekking, there are not many options for you to get a closer view. & As much as the view from the residential area was really closer, I think it is not very worthwhile. Admiring it from a distance feels the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dalessandra122
30,Neat for a one time thing,"Its a neat thing to be able to say ""I've been there and done that"" and take some pictures. But thats about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom31
30,Could just see it,from town we could just see it as the haze over on the hill where the sign is erected almost obliterated it. It lights up at night but unfortunately they were broken and not working not good for such an attraction,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adequate5510
40,Great.,Great trip up the hills. Loved the experience of seeing how the other side live . If you can you would probably get better view on the way before ascending up the hills as you do no get even close to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snapperette

30,An Iconic Photo Opportunity,"No, don't try climbing up to the Hollywood sign. But, while in Los Angeles, catching a glimpse of this iconic sign is quite fun and you can capture a photo of it from many different angles and locations. Why not do it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y7093ENlorim
50,A must,"If you are in LA, it's a must a landmark of California, it's very easy to get there , just follow the signs , amazing view by the way , try to catch the sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7527XBclaudiam
50,What a Great Hike,You'll need to check the locations to the trail head and be prepared for an easy but somewhat strenuous climb to the tower above the Hollywood Sign. On a clear day great views of Downtown L.A. all the way to Santa Monica as well as the entire San Fernando Valley. Start early and bring water!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiptonH

30,Could hardly see it,"Went on a tour, saw sign from observatory, could barely see it. The tour only spent a few minutes anywhere so it was not very good, tour guide started out friendly and funny and then seemed to either lose interest, or was being bothered by his boss too much. Tour was kind of a let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAT109

50,Hike to the Hollywood Sign,"We did the Hollywood Sign Hike where you get amazing views of the sign, as well as views from behind it. Definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840tahliac
50,Lived up to expectations,"We decided to take the trail from sunset ranch and hike to the top of the sign and we loved every bit of it. Challenging but not too much, beautiful views but slightly disappointed we didn't see a rattle snack despite the warning signs (my wife was not disappointed lol).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpH4472TF
50,Has to be done if in LA,You can get a great view of the Hollywood sign from Griffith Park and you get the added advantage of seeing the whole valley from one spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeggyDoll
30,Nothing to be Amazed,In reality there is not much yo see besides taking a good look at this iconic sign. You can obtain a good picture and view if you walk around the streets behind the Chinese Theater / Dolby Theater and save the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecestafe

30,From a distance,"It was disappointing that we could not get a picture up close to the sign,,the bus's were not allowed up to the sign due to the amount of dust they created travelling up there,,home owners had complained and the bus's were stopped from going up there,,so we had to see it from a distance,,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/30charmainec
30,Relaxing drive,Took a city tour with friends. Was able to visit the site for the Grammy awards. Drove through the city. The guide was helpful and knew the information to inform visitors.Did not walk up very close to the sign but was able to get a few pictures. Maybe the walk up the trail would be worth it but I was satisfied to be able to see it and take some pictures. The city tour in which it is included is well worth the drive and the money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LystraG
40,We finally saw it,Of course it is easy to see it from Griffith park but we decided to chase it from the Holywood area. We finally saw it from Cahuenga ave not far from crossing with Sunset blvrd. Ok probably not the best view but we saw it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanmouss
40,Why? Because it's there.,"We took photos from the shopping centre off Hollywood Boulevard. It is a must-do if in Hollywood.It is strange to see the aerials in our photos, as you tend to focus on the writing only when you see the sign on TV or in the cinema etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
40,Great Views,Very nice hike up from Griffiths. The trail was a little steep at times for our ten year old but we took our time and enjoyed the views along the trail. It was worth it to see the iconic sign from a new vantage point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jagustaf
40,Good workout,This is a must see in Los Angeles BUT... Could be difficult to access. Long dry trails to the bottom of the sign require some efforts. Get a good bottle of water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kojfb
10,Good than bad,Saw the sign in the afternoon on the highway than went to the observatory at night so I could take the time to actually take a picture and the lights were off illuminating it!! Very dissapointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phil5383
50,Girls getaway,Went sight seeing with girlfriends of mine from Georgia who had never been to Los Angeles. We enjoyed driving up the dirt road to see the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmaria09
30,Price is right,There are some fun and scenic drives that take you to photo ops. There is a regional park with parking and various places to takes photos with the sign in the background.You have to be careful because all of the access roads bring you through local neighborhoods and there are a lot of police monitoring traffic.It is fun to take your photo with the landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janelled328
50,Nice,See this sign was one of my bucket list thing to do (chek mark) my kids enjoy this adventure. Best place to see it from the Hollywood Blvd mall 2nd floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nayday0229
50,Gotta see it,"It's the hollywood sign. We drove up through a neighbourhood to get close, but you can see it from far and wide. Take a picture, get some palm trees in the picture if you can, and move on. It's a quick, free hit in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomasjQ1598KG
30,Nice to see,"Just gotta get the picture taken ;) Not the most fascinating thing i've seen in my life, but pretty cool to see in real life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viktoriawanders

50,Our Iconic Pitstop,"I visited with my 12 year old son. This place was extraordinary. It so historic and recognize that being near it as well as taking a picture with it was so satisfying and fun. It is a bit of a drive to get to but well, well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamLam3
50,Set the GPS to....,"3000 Canyon Lake Drive. Wide open park, tons of parking, amazing views of the sign. Easy to get to as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethC406
40,Hiking,"Me and my girlfriend, hiked once or twice up here, when you arrive to the top that's when you really understand how big Los Angeles is.",
50,Iconic View! Memorable Picture Moment!,We were fortunate enough to get a close up view of the sign via a street that is unknown to most tourists. One can't go to LA and not have their picture taken with the sign. It's a must do.,
40,Must Visit,"A little bit tricky up there but its worth it. So amazing and as people said, you not visiting Hollywood without taking picture with the Hollywood sign :P For those traveled by car, head to Franklin Blv, start from beachwood up to the hills, there were sign ""no access to Hollywood sign"" but we keep moving up hills and we got the nice view from there.",
30,Not what I spect for,We did a regular hollywood tour and we visit a spot where we were able to see the sing. But it was looking soooo small and far.. Not like they show on movies,
50,Iconic,"Saw the sign from several vantage points, including Griffith Park and Mulholland Drive. What can you say? No trip to L.A. would be complete without it!",
30,Iconic but underwhelming,We viewed it from Hollywood Boulevard and the Griffith Observatory with the latter providing a closer and better view. It can't be seen at night. It is Iconic but certainly not a highlight of our trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duncannj
20,Way too Hard to Find!,I'm not sure why they've made it so difficult to find the lookout spot for this iconic sign. It took us over 3 hours in LA traffic to make it to the observatory look out area. It was packed and the sign is so tiny from that spot that it barely shows up in pictures. Very disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/128dream
30,Miles away from anywhere,You have to photograph it but it's on a hill in the middle of no where and you can't get anywhere near it even if you try but it's a tourist must to get a photo,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharona205
30,Must Do,"If you're in LA and have a car then you have to do it. It's free, takes little time, and easily accessible from a trip to Hollywood Blvd.Don't let the 3 stars fool you. I highly recommend it. I only say average because I'm not a fan of Hollywood area in general. You'll get a different feel when you see the sign in a movie during a flyover. Seeing it from the ground looking up is a completely new prospective. I feel that most landmarks look bigger on TV, I think the Hollywood sign looks bigger in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/356evanl
50,Fun and great exercise!,We follow the review that gives the GPS address by Sunset Ranch and it was a breeze! As that review says definately bring water especially if you go mid day! The first 1/4 mile is the steepest so get through that and you'll be fine! Great views and photo ops. Must do and FREE!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenm302
40,Iconic photo opportunities but not easy to get near,"When in LA the Hollywood sign is a must photograph holiday snap. We could see it from our hotel but it was a long way off and also from the balcony of Loews Hollywood hotel however the view of it from Mulholland is fantastic. You can equally go to the Griffith Observatory and walk up through the park to get much closer but I'd recommend the views from Mulholland and you get to nosey at some fantastic houses out there as well. When coming down Mulholland Drive there is a car park and viewing are on your right. The car park is small though so it's another case of early/late viewing to get a definite space. It allows for about 12-15 cars but tour buses also go there blocking more of the facility off.Right past the exit there is room for four cars on the right of the road on the dusty border and you can get equally good pictures from here but beware, it's a no-parking zone and if the wardens are around you could face a fine. We considered it worth the risk for a few excellent photos however.An iconic landmark and essential holiday photo.",
50,Hollywood Park,Totally not what we expected. In a good way. We got there early morning so beat the crowds. Photos come out so well.There are no restroom facilities nearby so be sure to post your visits before arriving...,
40,Another freebee,This was nice we just saw it as we were walking down Hollywood St. And so was easy to take pictures of it.,
40,Worth the wait,"We walked from the observatory and boy was it a mission to get there, we appreciated it even more because of it. Ideally have a good sat navigation handy just in case there are road closers.",
40,"Gotta be done if you're a tourist, however ...","... you are not allowed right to the very top now due to too much traffic. Still, the place that you are allowed at gives you a decent enough photo opp.",
50,We saw a better view,"So you can see the Hollywood sign from a spot on the walk of fame. It was hazy so the view wasn't the greatest. We wanted a better view since we will never be back. I read that the spot to see it is up a hill through a neighborhood. The locals hate tourists going up by car and it was way too hot to hike up. So we requested a lyft driver to take us up. Found the spot, took quick pictures and got out of there. Cell service is limited. It was during the week so it wasn't crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisek857
50,Very cool,If you want amazing pictures of the hollywood sign start driving toward it. Tourist buses will only take you so far and it is still so far away... Road is blocked off so you cant get right up under it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unsatisfied19
30,Hollywood,I was so excited to see the most famous icon from LA. But It didnt lived upto its hype. Maybe I didnt get close enough. Closest I went was to have a look from Griffith observatory. Still visiting and coming back without a pic with this famous sign leaves your trip incomplete.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandeepP1356
30,in fact you see it from far so better having a good focus camera!,From the top of the shopping mall adjacent to the Chinese theater you will be queuing up a bit to take THE picture... Frankly speaking not sure it's worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabricetx
30,Less than spectacular,"You've seen it in movies so many times when you see it for real, it means very little. You don't need to drive to it...see it from a distance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CFred733
10,Waste of time,Online it showed that viewing the Hollywood sign from the Griffith Observatory proved to be the best location. After spending close to 90 minutes in traffic on the single lane road going up there we were turned around at the top because the parking lot was full and never even had a chance to see the sign.,
50,A must see,Only managed to get here as my OH had been before and knew a house address near the sign. The road is shut off so you can only get so far but it's a must see especially on a first visit,
50,Our visit to Hollywood sign,50 feet high & 400 feet wide sign of Hollywood is known through out the world . Has been a part of LA sine 1910. The sign is beautiful & we saw this on a clear & beautiful day.,
40,See it from 3000 Canyon Lake Drive (Lake Hollywood Park),"We stayed at the Loews Hollywood Hotel and booked a room that could see the Hollywood sign. That was great for one teen daughter whose main goal in LA was to see the sign, but then we drove to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive to take pictures holding the sign up like in the TV shows. Both teenagers had fun and it was easy to get to with enough parking on the street.",
40,Part of our tour,"A must see. If you take the ""Day in LA Tour"", you are taken to Griffith Observatory which was a great place to see the sign and take pictures.",
40,"It's Huge, no really!",Being from the U.K. we'd only seen this on a TV screen. I was keen to get as close as possible and used an online map app to show me the best roads. And off we went up the 10's of twisty roads to get a good viewing spot. When we arrived I was very impressed with how big it really is. Of course this is a must see for everybody. Although there are many places to see it - try to get close. Its worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
40,Hike it or Ride it,I enjoy hikes up to the Hollywood sign. There is nothing like waking up early to view the entire city from the sign.You don't like hiking go for a horse ride! There are plenty of companies that offer the service and you can have just as much fun roaming through the mountain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chozanacs
30,Taken a beaten over the years,"The sign has a lot of followers good and bad. But the sign represents ""Hollywood"", and so many people just want to see it. I found the best way was from the observatory. the local area has been so overrun with unwanted guests, you get the feel your not wanted. Admire from afar, and let the sign speak for itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12
40,Always fun to spot!,This iconic sign is hard to find if you don't know where to look. Just make sure you are near Hollywood and look up in the hills! Always fun to spot while in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariard
40,Do it so you can check it off the list,"I know it's touristy but I had to do it. I did the hike myself vs. a tour which is very easy to do. Here are highlights and tips from my trip:1. If you take the Holly Ridge trail it's only 3.5 miles round trip. Set your GPS for the Sunset Ranch (3400 N Beachwood Dr, Los Angeles, CA) and it will take you right to the entrance.2. I went early (8 AM) on a weekend (Sunday) which was nice because it was cool, quiet and lots of parking. The downside is it was foggy/smoggy so the view was limited.3. Watch where you park as there are a lot of privileged parking locations and you will be ticketed for parking there (like me).4. I am an experienced runner and still found much of the hike to be very steep and tiring so be prepared.5. Pay attention to the signs and your turns. There are several places that many trails combine and you could end up adding a significant distance to your hike if you aren't careful. A wrong turn added 4 miles to my hike.6. Take water even if you don't think you will need it (see #5 above). I didn't think I'd need it but I was there longer than I thought.7. If you have young kids you will need to keep your eyes on them, the walk can be tiring and it can be hot and sunny.8. If you want more exercise you can continue on past the Hollywood sign to the lookout spot higher up, but I will warn you that there are some places on the trail that are very primitive and require good coordination. The path is very narrow in some spots, slippery and right next to the edge of a cliff.9. If you are not in good physical condition, coordinated or are with small kids I advise AGAINST going past the sign which is accessible by very wide and safe trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691JohnA
50,Iconic,"Upon seeing the Hollywood sign, you feel the urge to pinch yourself. You know at that moment that you've arrived in Tinseltown. There are various vantage points, some better than others. We saw the sign from Griffith Observatory and that was perfectly good enough for us, but it may be possible to get closer. It's quite simply an icon of the movies and of America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilooliM
40,Must See,You haven't to Hollywood if you don't see the sign we had a Taxi driver take us to Mt Lee Drv and we walked up a bit great view no people around unlike the main look out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevorm537
50,Highlight,Has to be a highlight of any trip LA. Was looking forward to seeing it and it doesnt disappoint. They have it framed nicely by the galleria and several places to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/249chipb
40,Do a tour to see this...,"We drove around looking for a good place to stop so we could get a good view of the sign for photos. We tried to get a park somewhere close to Griffith Observatory - forget it. I've since heard that it's like that all the time so don't bother.We ended up taking a tour that took us up the hill to a lookout with the perfect view of the sign, Hollywood hills and LA. Tour buses park illegally and push their way in so you're guaranteed to see it! You also get the story behind the sign which is cool.A must see and do in my book.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nat0716
50,Landmark,You can't go to Hollywood and not check the sign out. Don't even think about it. Just get up and go....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/277moniqueg

50,Very cool thing to see in person,Very cool thing to see. We saw it from Lake Hollywood Park. Great view and relatively close!! Gets busy but had no problem parking along street,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmanso28
50,Always amazing to see THIS sign :),"I have seen this sign so many times... I freak out every single time I see it, for some reason! It will not disappoint you, there are many ways to get there, the closer you get, the better ofcourse :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellevlavianos
30,Group of 24,Best place to see it is from the Griffith Observatory. Bring a good camera as the basic camera's will not do it justice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTSCTO
20,Not much to it... difficult to get close,"It was difficult to get close to it as many roads are closed off for tourists. Fortunately we found a way to get reasonably close. But was it worth it? In the end, there is not much to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Garfield963
50,Hollywood!,"Seen it from a scenic view, didn't get to go to the observatory for the best view. Learned that it was suppose to be a temporary sign and originally said Hollywood Land. I don't know how accurate that is, but that's what the tour guide said.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maine3k2
50,HAVE TO PHOTOGRAPH!!! Many points to see from.,We felt best photos were taken from Griffith Park and Mulholland Drive. Cannot walk up to as fencing around it. Iconic!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaimelovebug
50,Has to be seen,Something you have to see when your in Hollywood. A nice thing to say you have seen it but at the end of the day its a sign on a hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860marie
50,LA must-see,"If you visit LA and don't see the Hollywood sign from some place, up close or from the Hollywood Walk of Fame then you have missed a reason to visit. On a sunny day that LA has ever day it shines and radiates its power over the landscape and long may it do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,Iconic,Had a number of vantage points whislt staying in Hollywood to view the sign including from my bedroom of the hotel I was staying in which was nice,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH80
40,Iconic even though you don't get near it,"This is the first on the thnings to see, our first view was from the Highway, then from Griffith observatory - from here it looks good, but the tour guide stated we would tear up the photograph from here when we got to their preferred vantage point - they were right!Standing in a clearing on one side of a valley with a vineyard on the lower slopes and the sign above the view is spectacular well worth it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BarryB194
50,What a view!,"Make sure you get up to the Griffith observatory early, park on the road as you approach as the car park is pretty small. The walk up to the sign is well worth it but make sure you have proper shoes on! The views over LA are breath taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9065JQphilc
50,Cheesy but a must do!,"Seeing the sign is a must do while visiting Los Angeles. There is a cool neighborhood you drive through to get to the sign and it makes for a lovely drive. As you go around different turns, the sign is visible from different angles. Definitely cheesy, but definitely fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannas704
40,Snapping a pic is a must,My son had taking a pic of the Hollywood Sign on his bucket list of things to do in California so we drove up Beachwood Drive and parked and since there's not much traffic we were able to take an unobstructed view photo of the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingParent1
40,Memorable Sign,It was like a dream come true. Aleays watched it though cinemas and always wanted to see the place.I had visited the place solo and it was a nice experience. I saw the sign first from the observatory and later i traveled through the streets to get a good picture location and had many pictures taken.Its a difficult walk to the place or it seems to me. The view is also nice.I have added some photos bt closeup photos were not available with me now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kuriachan
50,Found a Great View,"Stopped to see sign. Great experience with awesome few and pics, thanks to a blog with a good address for stopping and viewing. Another must see and off bucket list!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boyz4Us
40,"Even the ""easy trail"" (Hollyridge) can be tough in the heat!","Found street parking at the top of Beachwood Drive, followed the street (walking) to a gate in the fence to start up the trail. You get very, very dusty as the path is all loose dirt. Bring a lot of water and your camera and probably a hat, and dress in comfy clothes and good walking, running or hiking shoes. Sandals would not be good for this. My Mum and I gave up about 1/3 of the way up, just got too hot and sweaty, felt yucky. The rest of my family carried on and said the elevation got much easier after we stopped! So if you get to a lookout area with a big rock to sit on and the horses down below to your left you should find it easier going after that. They got up higher and took some photos and turned around where others were as well. They said coming down was tricky as you had to be careful not to slip. There are no bathrooms around this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisan670
50,Went to visit the famous Hollywood Sign. Too Cool!,It was a bit of a walk but well worth being able to see the Hollywood sign up close. The view is breathtaking and I would recommend the visit to anyone who is fit to hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWB2011
50,Great,"Amazing to see the sign up close. Our tour guide on the bus stopped to let us take photos, it got very busy waiting your turn to snap a photo but worth it. Lovely views across the city too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/590janicem
50,Cool!,Really cool to see in person but it's best to look at it from a distance. Don't try to drive right up next to the sign because it's in a residential neighborhood and the old ladies will chase you off and try to take picture of your license plate to turn into the cops...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tkeenan1
50,Wouldn't have nissed it,"We dropped my son off for an internship in LA and this was the first thing we did. We drove up to Lake Hollywood Park to get a good look at the sign. This is a perfect spot to get a good, unobstructed picture of the sign. The park is a dog park, with a ton of people and their dogs. But there is a lookout just above the dog park that you can walk up to for great pictures also. The ride up to the park is a fun, winding road with neat houses to look at also.I think this is a must see if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V9139BXsandyd
50,Hollywood Sign,"If you're visiting Los Angeles you have to snap a cool picture by the Hollywood sign! It's a dirt area where you can get the best picture, but you can also just drive around to get the best shot without the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShayStelise
50,The most iconic image of LA and seen from everywhere,"Every city has that one image that is associated with it and for LA it is the ""Hollywood"" sign. I remember the first time I saw it from the 3rd floor of LACMA, it was an image I texted my family. However we had two occasions to get great views of the sign.The first, most public and easiest to get to was Griffith Park specifically the Observatory. Here you have vistas made for great views of the sign and the mountain it is on. We also hiked Mt. Hollywood which rises above the sign and also offers great places for pictures from above.The second great spot is in the original Hollywoodland subdivision just below the sign. The is a great park that rest under the sign and overlooks the reservoir that offers great scenes for the sign.While these were the best 2 spots of us, the sign can be seen from many places in the city and it is quintessential LA. The important part of any visit to Los Angeles is to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
40,Couldn't get as close as I wanted,"Not much to say about this one. Its a sign of a hill. I took Mulholland drive to get to the overlook. That is a scary road! There is not much parking at the overlook sight. Be prepared, you are still quite a distance away from the sign. You will need to bring a camera with a good zoom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodawgs
50,Iconic,How wonderful it was to see this sign in perfect weather. It is iconic so it is a must if you are visiting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Selgris
40,Charlie Turner Trailhead,We stopped at this trail head in hopes to get to the sign close. But with two little kids and no water I was not about to try that hike. The hike is more like a sidewalk but in flip flops I wasn't going to attempt. Fun to go see and show the kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation105
50,Amazing views!,"We walked all the way up to the sign and back. The views were the most amazing. When we got to the top we only saw the back of the sign and it was very difficult to even take a picture of it. However, it was worth the journey since the views were spectacular!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/37iIda
30,Just plain hassle with little reward,Hiking to the Hollywood sign is at best dumb. It is a big disappointment! After all it is just letters and really nothing to write home about. I viewed it from the Hollywood and Highland building where the Oscars are held and it is a much better view! Plus some great restaurants. So don't hassle trying to get close to the sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gizmo013_13
50,Seen by helicopter!,In our opinion the best way to see the Hollywood sign - by helicopter! We went with Elite who were just fantastic! Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/honestreviewer1972
40,Iconic picture spot,"Every tourist should have their photo in front of this sign, one of the best spots is on Beachwood, just north of Franklin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christiki999
50,Sign is Cool,"It's a great tourist viewpoint. Definitely go see it. Driving on the 10, the 5, or the 101 near downtown LA or Hollywood gives you plenty of opportunity to get a great picture. Go visit this iconic sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronj365
40,Mark another one off the bucket list!,I was in town on business but had a day off so I p!ayed tourist. The sign can be seen from various locations but you can't get very close to it. I've seen it on multiple TV shows as well as movies so it was neat seeing it in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joefromjohnsisland
30,Don't drive or hike up!!,"For a good view there is no need to go up the hill, as it is extremely dangerous. Very narrow roads, with cars parked on corners etc. Which makes it dangerous for hikers and all auto traffic. People are opening their car doors at the wrong time, unsupervised children and visitors not paying attention to the zoo-like traffic jam.The hike up is no better.it is extremely steep going up, and auto traffic dangerous as there are no sidewalks.You can skip ALL this with photo opportunities at the southwest corner of Gower and Hollywood Blvd. Or go NO further than Beechwood and Temple Hill. Perfect photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag
50,Fairly easy to find and get great pics of,"It is one of the true icons of American society, capturing the wonder and temptation of the American dream. The Hollywood sign just has a real coolness factor to it, but there is also a lot to see and explore in that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrylmills73

50,Rode up on a Harley,OK ...Guess everyone's got to see the Sign. My Son and I rode (On Harley Davidson Motorbikes) up the small twisty roads lined with expensive houses. Got as far as you could go by bike . Where you can walk the remainder up a path .Not for the faint hearted or to do it in the Sunny Heat of the day.Was impressive. Got our photo like all good tourists do !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparkez
40,its a good sight,you can watch the sign from the Griffith observatory or use the Egyptian theatre probably to watch the sight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sachindedhia
50,You have to see the place,A visit to LA wont be complete without a tour to this place..its crowded and busy but i do find relaxing too...seeing the printed names of your favorite stars feels great and amazing..i like the buildings shops and all the surroundings...this one's a perfect tourist spot!,
30,Just a Sign,"We were shown the sign from a distant, but it is only a sign, don't waist your time on that, better to visit more important attraction than it",
50,Icon of Hollywood,You can see the sign from any number of venues including the Hollywood Walk of Fame. You get a great view at Griffith Observatory but We traversed it up to Canyon Lake Road to get closer to the sign. You really can't get much closer so it really depends upon what you like and how much time that you have. It is the iconic sign seen in many movies so you need to see it for a Picture.,
30,Iconic view - can't get close,"The sign is most certainly a must see but while I found one walking tour that claims it get close, it seems the city and most other tour companies feelIt is best to see from a distance.",
50,Interesting behind the sign.,It was neat to see the Hollywood sign. It is smaller than you think but there is a neat story that goes with it. If your in the area go to the Observitory and see it. Glad we did.,
30,Just a sign!,This one is one of the most hyped things to do in los angeles. Just a matter of clicking pic with the sign in background,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vishu008
50,GOT TO SEE ONCE! Best place to see the sign is...,"The best way to view the sign is to go up North Beachwood Drive, off Franklin Ave. You can't get to the actual sign as it is locked now. But the best photos will be on Beachwood.Visit the Beachwood cafe if you want to hang out in the little village just past the best viewing point. It's very Hollywood and has great food! I wrote a reivew on this as well. Great breakfast place! Saturday night dinners are fun with their old black and white movies they play. I don't work for them! I just live in the area and thoroughly enjoy this place. It's all part of the ""Hollywood sign"" trip I feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catherinet115

20,Small,We saw the sign at the Griffith observatory. It's iconic but smaller than expected. Photo opportunity with a whole lot of zoom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PurKar
50,Morning hike to the Hollywood sign,"This is definitely a must see attraction when visiting LA. However make sure you go either very early (6-8am) or in the evening (7-8pm) as the temps in the hills get over 100 degrees by mid day. The walk is not overly strenuous but I would drive from the road up to the top and the walk the remaining way (there is a gate at the end of the road). The walk from the gate to the sign is about 3 miles and offers plenty of great photo opps along the way. Wear comfortable shoes, I can't tell you how many people were wearing flip flops and had blood on there feet. The walk is not hard but it does get hot so bring a water bottle and wear a hat and sunglasses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderfedericoIV
40,"Worth the walk, great views and photo ops","I went on a walking tour organised by my hostel. It is quite a walk up to the main photo area but well worth it for the photos and views you get.Make sure you wear sunscreen, a hat and take some water. It gets very hot. As I was with a large group we didn't go all the way to the sign as we couldn't be bothered to walk another couple of miles to see the back of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookeo850

50,thats all folks!,i went on a bus tour which the Hollywood sign was a part of the stops it made. 1st we could only go so far up the mountain to see the sign and then we were given 8 minutes to take pictures of the sign and then we had to re-board the bus on to the next part of the tour. not sure of whats so exciting except i saw a landmark. its not even lit up at night. don't think they think much of this sign in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janew679

50,Always a thrill,"For anyone growing up dreaming of making it in Hollywood-seeing the sign in person is a thrill. I never had that dream, but I have always thought everything was glitz and glamour in Hollywood. The sign can be seen from the freeway, city streets and neighborhoods. The best way to get a good view of the sign is from Griffith Park. There is no need to try to hike close to the sign, because that would just be frustrating. Go to the observatory and take your selfies in safety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43

40,Feel the Nostalgia,"It can be difficult to get to the best view points but it's certainly worth the effort. It's a simple photo opportunity really but one worth taking, you'd regret it if you didnt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryR928
40,Take the hike!,"From a distance, the Hollywood sign is exciting for the first 3 seconds you see it. After that, it's basically just another billboard. However, if you're in good shape I definitely recommend taking the hike through Griffith Park and seeing it up close! We began at Burbank Peak to see the Wisdom Tree, and then went across to Mount Lee (where the Hollywood sign is). When you get there you end up right behind the sign and can look out over all of LA. Allow yourself a few hours for this hike, pack a lot of water and a snack, and wear sunscreen. I would not do this hike in extreme heat or bad weather. There is very little shade, and it can be steep and narrow at times. It's definitely a work out, but if you enjoy the outdoors and awesome views it's totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avega03
20,Very far,"The sign is located so far on the mountain, that you can hardly see it. No matter how close we tried to get to it, it was still very far and nothing impressive",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliak663
50,A good hike,You can view it from the tourist overlook or hike around the hill to the top and see behind the sign. I hiked this area every day while I stayed and it's a nice iconic piece of history not everyone is fortunate to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/548jordanf
50,Fun,We drove up the the hill through a residential area and ended up at a little vista point area where we were able to see the valley and the Hollywood sign. Everyone there was trying to get their photo with the sign in the background. We enjoyed seeing the sign and best of all it was free!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Backsi
40,Put it on your bucket list,"You came to LA. You've got to to it! The easy trails are well maintained. It will be crowed, probably hot. There will be a long wait at the only restroom. Parking is lousy. You won't get close enough to sit in the sign, but the other selfies you record on the way up will be special memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoYork
50,A must to see.,"The Hollywood sign can be seen from miles away, with binoculars. However, the best way to see it is up closer. It originally said ""Hollywoodland"". The Hollywood Sign is a landmark and cultural icon spelled out in45"" tall white capital letters and is 350' long. It was created in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real estate development.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/457EstherK
50,How can you not get this picture,"This is a must and it is free. There are various spots to go and get a great pic. The mulholland drive , Hollywood bowl, scenic over look....Griffith park...or go up towards the sign itself. Google various spots to snap a pic. The three I gave you are all unique shots, and you get a lot of nice views along the way. Make it fun. Use a real camera if you have...the phones just don do it justice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/22MichaelA22
20,Enjoy the sign but do not hike to it,"The Hollywood sign is our symbol sort of like our Eiffel Tower, the symbol of Paris. Not to imply that LA has anything over Paris. Well, okay, sun, sand and surf for sure. BTW I'm an LA native, which may give some a bit more to hate about me.If you want to hike to the sign, do a little research and please do not drive up Beachwood and park in the residential neighborhood. Unfortunately, over the years the neighborhood has seen an increase in crime and property damage at the hands of a few tourists and that has soured the residents. If you choose to use your GPS and ignore the signs and attempt to hike from Beachwood, bring plenty of water and be sure your cell phone is charged so you can call for help. It's actually a difficult journey and will take a couple of hours round trip. It can get very hot.I've seen a photo of an excellent vantage point off of Lake Hollywood which also offers excellent views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powerharp
50,Good view of city,"This is done on a jeep tour passing through Beverly Hills, seeing the houses of the famous, except you don't really get to see much of them as covered by trees!! But at top, beautiful view of LA skyline",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemariep923
10,Yawn.,"Oh boy. I'm sure others have sharply differing opinions, but for my money, this is the most boring ""tourist attraction"" in Los Angeles. I mean, it's the restored remains of an old advertising sign - at this point, t's not even an antique. Just another desperate attempt to keep you folk from Iowa impressed with what used to be the glamorous hub of the film business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProPhotoLA
50,Rite of Passage,The best (and probably safest) place to see the sign is the Griffith Observatory. Unadulterated views on a clear day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Enigmaman95
40,Dominates Hollywood Skyline,Not really requiring any special effort to see as if you are visiting Hollywood itself the sign still dominates the skyline. Easily visible from the Hihland mall or alternatively Griffith Observatory allows you to combine two sights at once.Seeing (and taking pictures) of the sign is just one of the must do parts of your first visit to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RJG1972
40,It is what it is....the sign,"This sign is much smaller than that appears in the movies. It is hard to get a clear view sometimes. But once you do get one and snap the photo, you do feel like you have arrived in California. Its just iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferL527
20,Just a giant billboard,The history behind the sign is very cool however seeing the sign itself is just ok. Having lived in CA for most of my life going to Hollywood is nothing special mostly because there is usually a lot of traffic and its not as pretty as in the movies. I guess its worth a photo if you have never seen it or hiking around it can be fun too but you can no longer hike near it just a few miles away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micheleaP2556FJ
20,"okay, so now I've seen that","The sign itself is of course iconic, and if you are in Los Angeles you'll want to see it. But it can be seen from different angles and places around the city. No need to get closer...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valdans
30,On the bucket list,We really wanted to get a good picture of the Hollywood sign and with the Hollywood sign. We drove around and finally we found the right spot. It took some time to find this spot but it led us through beautiful streets with beautiful houses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1535T
50,A Must when in LA!,Felt surreal seeing it in person after dreaming about my whole life...just a shame it was foggy every time we saw it! But tick - we did it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellndip
40,You have to see it but...,"It's not as spectacular as you want it to be but definitely a must to check off the list.It's an easy ride from Hollywood (type Hollywood sign"" into Google driving). It will take you to the Griffith Observatory.It's a hot spot to get a bird's eye view of Hollywood and the sign.Parking is limited in the lot but you can park on the mountain road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GAkimberlyPEACH
50,"Easy, nice walk with 360 degrees view","I walked with my 11 y/o. It's about 45min hike - doing the short cut from Sunset Ranch. Google it using Sunset Ranch Hollywood as you destination because you actually start from the ranch. Here's the direction site that I followed.http://hollywoodsigntrip.com/hollywood-sign-trail.shtmlThe link above didn't mention about the ranch gate. The ranch has a gate and you need to get through the gate for you to park inside and began your hike. So we just parked outside the gate in the street. However, the parking is only available after 4pm and the other half of the street in only after 6 pm. And it's too many cops giving parking tickets so be careful. It is actually perfect time to hike at 6 as it a lot cooler. We started to descend around 7:30 and got to the car around 8. It was still plenty of light. Again this is the shortcut route. If you start form Griffith Observatory it would take about 3 hours average.The view is absolutely awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kawaii40
50,Nice tour,It is nice because it is a very famous sign but in fact it is not an excited tour. If you have free time do it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viviangom
30,Underwhelming,Worth one look in my humble opinion. Griffith Observatory worth a look ( nearby).I wouldnt go there especially to see the sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussellH796
30,People would spend 3 hours walking and taking pictures!,"So much to see and do in Hollywood! This isn't it.. We got close enough with our tour guide for a quick photo and done! People would walk up very steep hills through a neighborhood with no parking in order to get ""closer"". Unless you have incredible amounts of time - take a gander and move on! Nothing to see here :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64pennyj
40,Be prepared!,"We started at the Griffith Observatory and hiked (almost) all the way to the sign. Be prepared because it is a LONG hike. It took us about 2.5 hrs to get almost all the way (we stopped and turned around). Now, we did have 6 people including a 3 year old being carried on our back which slowed us down but it is still a LONG way! Well worth it though! You can also try to drive through the residential areas in the hills for a close view from the bottom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515
50,Just has to be done!,We went with a driend who lives in LA so managed to get a little closer than we thought we could.To see it in reality is purely breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeannieCass
40,Finally made Hollywood !!!!!,"An iconic sign that has been filmed endlessly, in a lovely location that you can drive to up long winding roads and once at the top look over towards the sign. The views are amazing across to the sky line of Los Angeles, a must if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicolaa405
40,Photo opportunity,"So this is a bucket list for most.We left a little later than we should have and tried via Griffith Park and the Observatory.The traffic was crazy and 100 DEG didn't encourage us to stop and walk up the hill.If you want to see it, drive up Mulholland Drive where there are less crowds and you can see the sign, albeit a distance.The views of LA are great and you can get a selfie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V327YSandrews
40,Pretty neat. A one time must see.,"Now I can say I've been there and done that. But I probably could have gotten closer. I viewed it from the Griffith Observatory, a ""kill-two-birds-with-one-stone"" free deal.",
40,Iconic Sign,"Although we didn't do the hike, there were many times and opportunities to see the sign and take photographs. One of these opportunities was on the red route of the hop-on hop-off bus. Fantastic to actually see it in person and not just on the silver screen. Certainly an iconic must see in Hollywood.",
10,If you view this picture‚Ä¶you've done the Hollywood sign!,"Here's the menu for ""doing"" the Hollywood sign:1. Read in histories that it was shortened from HOLLYWOODLAND by real estate developers.2. View it up close by taking lousy winding roads (Tall Letters) or from afar (shorter letters).3. Watch films that feature it in their establishing shots.4. See scenes from the Charlie Chaplin bio where the actors climb on it and dangle their feet.5. Buy T shirts and mugs that prove you visited L.A.There! you've done the HOLLYWOOD sign.",
40,Nice Hike / View,"This was nice to finally get here. I have seen it my whole life on the TV & in movies. I never thought I would be here, but I finally made it. It is a nice hike up there. The view is fabulous - at the right time of day & year. Go on a sunny but not too hot day.",
30,A little disappointed!,"We went there thinking we could hike with our 10 & 16 year old. However the hike was long and nothing we could do to get close to the sign. I'll also add here the smog was horrible and we could hardly see the sign. From the website I thought it'd be an easy walk it was not. We did the shortest walk to get a little closer, but make sure you are wearing comfy shoes! Also it was more fun listening to all the conversations as you go! Be prepared to deal with parking we waited a while to get there and park.",
50,Nice place!,"This is a place to observe the landscape.This place is magic! Where dreams can come true. You can take pictures, observe and walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sueli22
10,Trying to see sign closer was a Disaster!,My 14 year old wanted to get some pics up close and personal with the Hollywood sign. So we plugged it in Google Maps and headed in that direction. Only to find lines of cars waiting to get a closer look and parking fees of $25. We along with several others turned around after waiting for over 20 minutes in traffic. If you want a cool pic of your time in LA try the Beverly Hills sign. Or go to Griffith Park observatory! Because this was a huge waste of time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6658SElisat
30,Must have photo,"Took a drive straight up N Beachwood Drive as suggested. Here you will find a gate leading in to Sunset Ranch. Park your car, go through the pedestrian gate and walk up to an elevated position, take your photos and get out of there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641steveb
50,Great view,It took us around 45 minutes to find the right place to get a nice view of the sign :)Quite confusing as its a residential area with posh homes. Finally ended up on the right road. There is a park where u can picnic and have a view of the sign. Cars can be parked along the road. Can trek as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3271LZmanub
50,Got sun burnt but it was worth it,My friends and I did the hollywood sign hike. I got a serious sun burn and my skin is still peeling as result but it was so worth it. I got out of my comfort zone and I did something completely unlike me. my friends and I did the 4mile hike to the hollywood sign. It was terrifying and exhilarating. I would do it all over again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/euniceo498
50,Was a great view!!,Was able to get some clear and nice pictures of the famous Hollywood Sign! Wasn't too tricky to get around the other ppl so that was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Well worth a visit,What trip to Hollywood would be complete without a visit to the famous sign!! Getting close to the sign is only really possible from behind and requires a 'healthy' 2-3 mile walk through Griffith park. It is well worth the sweat (take some water with you) as the view down into Hollywood is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbF4603YX
40,Not the Hollywood feel you would think,Never really clear the whole time we were there but it was great to see this icon. We were warned it would be hard to see well but even driving closer was a little disappointed but so glad we got to see it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O8965XNmichellem
40,Just had to see this,It was neat to see but we couldn't get too close because they made you park at the bottom of the hill. We couldn't walk up becasue my husband is handicapped so we were a bit disappointed. I am still glad we were able to see this landmark and would do it again even though we couldn't get too close. The views of the city were amazing too. Bring lots of water to drink-it was HOT!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197christinem
50,No Brainer!,"Just trying to get yourself and your family in a photo with the Hollywood sign is a fun experience! The people you meet, the photos you take for others, the ones they take for you, the conversations you have, it's all part of the fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoachMeMaria
50,Movie fan,Absolutely love this landmark of the city! Feel free to create any type of photo-taking posture that you could imagine to match with the Sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chinchilla520
50,Corny or not,How can you come to Hollywood and not see the sign?The question becomes more about where you get your picture from and there's a number of good choices. You have to fit your spot to work with you travels,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
30,Hard to find,"I feel silly writing this...but wow is that sign hard to find. The Hollywood traffic is really bad, or at least it was when we were there, and though we could find the sign once or twice, it was hard to get a clear shot of it. Then, we went up in the park and there was again a traffic jam and no clear way or directions of how to get to the sign. We finally gave up...I obviously needed a map to find this but I expected it would be well marked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shalan1234
40,Beautiful Hike!,"A must do in LA. There are several different routes (shorter/longer) but all meet up at the same spot right above the Hollywood sign. The views are amazing, and overlook all of LA. On the way back down there is another lookout point where you can get great pictures of the sign behind you. TIP: bring your own water, there is nowhere to buy anything anywhere on the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allison9723

50,Very cool,"Such a thrill! So very Exciting to see the ""Hollywood"" sign up on the hill. Visible from quite a distance. Terrific photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritas586
50,nice safe walk,parked at the observatory and hiked to sign. Lots of people around so its safe going alone. Horse back begins around 9. very pretty. a must on everyone's bucket list,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/friendlyplacetostay
50,Have to do the hike!,This is a staple must do activity if you're in LA. There's a bunch of hike routes you can take to get up to the sign. The hike it self is great with tons of views out to the city and valley. And it's great exercise!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/563bent
50,Iconic Site,This is one of the top places to see when visiting Los Angeles. I've been to the sign several times to show family and friends from out of town. It's thrilling driving up the back roads and an essential place to take some memorable pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelRobs
30,IF YOU MUST......,"Take it from a native! There are 3 options for getting your photo with The Hollywood Sign. MapQuest Lake Hollywood Park which is at the end of a narrow winding road, hike up to and get a close look at the sign (a real waste of an hour++ of your tourist sightseeing time) or take a photo/selfie with the sign over your shoulder framed by a tree lined street on Beachwood Drive which is off of Franklin, 1 block north of Hollywood Blvd. If you opt for the Beachwood viewing, it will\ save you a lot of time which can be better spent with the crazies and crowds on Hollywood Blvd's Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave
50,THE Sign on a hillside,"It is just one of the many things to see in Hollywood. An experience! ""I've seen that!"" It is worldly iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigRon40
50,A hollywood must,You must find the time to have your photo taken infant of the famous sign. Most tours of LA include a stop for this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wenzzzz
40,See LA from the top,We can see how polluted LA is in the afternoon from here. We can hike and take some pictures with hollywood sign after 45 minutes walking up the hill as no cars are permitted to go up. And u can watch a very nice sunset too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linachandr
50,The best photographic part of LA,"The Hollywood Sign is the best place to visit if you want fantastic photos of the city and if you want to make your friends jealous.They call it a 'hike' but I would say it's more like an uphill walk. There are different ways of getting there of course but the most popular way would be through the Hollyridge trail which you can get to at the end of Beachwood Drive.There are plenty of blogs online that tell you how to get up there but if you just follow the crowd, you should be up there in no time.As a reference this is the blog I referred to:http://samoverlands.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/a-hike-to-hollywood-sign.htmlThis was hands down my favourite part about LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/73natashaa
30,Just a sign,"After viewing the Griffith observatory we went on the hike to the Hollywood sign. The hike is amazing, fun, and interesting! One thing I will not recommend taking young ones with you kind of dangerous! We hiked for 2 hours and reached the sign I mean it's just tall metal letters! So wasn't as fascinating as one would think! View is amazing, feel free to look at my other reviews on my visit in Los Angeles. Just remember take some water on your hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnthonyG3543
50,Worth the hype,It's a pretty easy hike and there's something special about seeing it in person after seeing it in so many movies and on postcards etc. I liked it even more once I learned about it's history. It originally said Hollywood Land For Sale and was a marketing tool to sell the land in the Hollywood Hills. It was abandoned and fell apart over time until someone finally decided that it was such a Icon and symbol of LA and decided to save it and maintain it.Unfortunately you can't actually get to the base of the sign (fenced off) - legally anyway!BTW I used to take my son with me and alternated between letting him walk and a baby bjorn carrier so it really is very doable for almost anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culinary-widow
40,A must,There is no way you can go to Los Angeles and not want to see the Hollywood sign. It's an icon af the 20th century and you simply have to. And once you have you are at peace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atlanticophelia
10,Mission and not worth it.,Drive up through the houses to get the best photo view of the sign... They have supposedly fenced off all area around the sign and put in huge pot holes so you can't get near it... What's the point I don't know!?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDannykelly
50,"It is just a sign, but an iconic one - worth the hike in my opinion","It was a beautiful sunny day - not too hot. Take lots of water and a camera. Great view of LA at top of Mt. Lee. We hiked a moderate path that was about 7 mi round trip. Give yourself about 3 hours.HOW TO GET THERE: From the south side of Griffith Park, head north on Canyon Drive from Franklin Avenue. Once the road enters Griffith Park it's stopped by a locked gate at the trailhead. Park in the small lot at the trailhead, along the street, or in the spillover lot just south of the trailhead.HIke north and follow the signs the trail is very well marked.We did not take the trail to the Bat caves.Some of the trail is dirt some towards top is paved road.Once at the top you can see the sign from the back - aka the DOOWYLLOH sign.continue up to the summit of Mt. Lee and take pics of the pacific ocean.If you just want views of the Hollywood Sign, when you get to the paved Mount Lee Drive take a left here and descend a bit ‚Äì but if you want go to the top of Mount Lee and get behind the sign, take a sharp right onto Mount Lee Drive and start steep incline.We saw runners, people of all ages, people walking their pets and they must have horse ride outings because we saw horses on the trail too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lispony
30,Classic must see,Its around and hard to miss. You will see it while driving or there are some great hikes to get up closer to the sign. Part of Hollywood history and fun to see in person,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lvanclief
30,"Been there, done that","Visiting the Hollywood sign and the surrounding area is obligatory for the first time visitor to Los Angeles. The day was very hot, so we spent as little time out of the air conditioned vehicle as possible. It's an interesting thing to see, but nothing that's going to make or break a trip. Been there, done that is how I felt upon concluding our visit there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greghY283TX
20,Eeehhhhhhhhh nah,"I have to say this is likely a right of passage you have to do when visiting Hollywood, but let's be real.......it's a sign on a hill.......it's somewhat disappointing, but you'll take a picture of it none the less just to say you did it. It's ok, I did it too, but I wouldn't do it a second time no!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3463XWlauras
50,Awesome to see in person!,See it for yourself. It's worth it and cool! We got a good angle by taking a Hollywood tour through A-List tours = recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G1083SOjimp
50,A must if you visit LA,"This is a must do if you are visiting LA, not only will you get to see the sign but you will also enjoy the beautiful views that LA has to offer. You can drive up through some really nice neighborhoods in the Hollywood hills and park your car and then take a hike that's about 30 minutes and it will take you right behind the sign. Make sure to read the parking signs. I think that you can't park at all on the street during the weekend, but if it is during the week then you should be fine. I have done the hike a few times with my husband and my friends. The last time I went I took my 8 year old nephew and he loved it. Make sure you take comfortable shoes, water and a snack and you should be fine. This hike will take you as close as you can get to the famous Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zaydarosales
30,Not easily accessible.,Was surprised to know that its not a touristy friendly attraction as it seems the locals are trying to avoid it.However my friend who is from LA took me up there across the hills. Its ok for pix but not much to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loomi
50,Just as I imagined,"I was gutted at first as we went on a bus tour and they told us the closest you could get to the sign was from the top of the shopping mall, so we went to take pictures and even zoomed in to max setting the sign just looked like a white line I felt major let down. Then we hired an √ºber driver to take us to Warner studios and he was brilliant he told us about Hollywood lake road which is a windy road that takes you up to very close to the sign it's brilliant and just what I imagined it would be like amazing for pictures and you can hike even closer than I went if that's something you like doing it made my day just like the movies",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888freyal
30,You can see it better on TV,"For an iconic symbol of the movie industry, the sign is underwhelming given that it is so far from everything . From Griffith Observatory, it is off at an angle. From Los Feliz Blvd below you can see it every time you pass a street but still it is quite far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mitch708
40,I mean you have to!,"its really not impressive at all, and its tiny, but you still have to go up and get your photo in front of it. A trip to LA wouldn't be complete with out it. Not something you do more than once though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelctaylor
40,Okay,This is one of those things where it's fun to do for a day but beyond that I wouldn't plan a trip around it. Hope you have zoom on your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diane062016
50,Cool Adventure!,"We did not get out since we were just sight seeing and had been out and about most of the day. We did drive up to the highest point and it was really cool to see the sign that close up. If you start at the walk of fame and gps up to the sign, it takes through the neigborhoods. So neat seeing how people live on the side of a hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8531PXkatherineb
50,A photo for your memories,We drove up one of the side streets to get a picture of this sign but take note that the local residents do not like a lot of traffic parking up which is understandable but you really do need a good picture of this for your trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinac492
30,You saw it in this photo! Where to really see it.,Beautiful neighborhood but not worth the trip to drive up to or close to the sign. You can see this sign from various areas such as at Vine and HIghland where there is a clear photo for you to take while resting on a beautiful bench and then going immediately to shopping and touring on Hollywood Blvd. Go to Hollywood Blvd where you can also take a tour to not only see this sign but many other things.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899

40,Saw this in the distance!,"We didn't have time to drive closer to the Hollywood Sign so we were pleasantly surprised to see it from the Hollywood and Highland Center where we were having dinner. This was also close to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and TCL Chinese Theatre. Although it was tiny, we still took pics along with a lot of other people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tofurry

50,Hooray for Hollywood (Sign)!,"You simply can not leave Hollywood without getting a good look and photographs of the Hollywood Sign. Recognizable around the world, the Hollywood Sign serves as confirmation that ""yes, you really are there"" in the magical city where movies have been made for nearly 100 years. For me, to look up and see that sign that I've seen so many times on tv and in movies was a real thrill. Though you can see it from many places, one of the best places to get an unobstructed and clear view (and great photo!) of the sign is up at the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park (worth a visit itself) up 1134' in the Santa Monica Mountains that surround the city. At this elevation and location in the mountains, you are significantly closer to the sign. I got a perfect photo of the sign from here - proof that I really was in Hollywood!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriJMK

50,An Iconic Hollywood Symbol,"Everywhere I went in Los Angeles, i always looked for the Hollywood sign. You can see it very well from the shops at Hollywood and Highland. You are very close to it at the Griffith Observatory. get out your camera and snap a few pics of this iconic symbol.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
40,Enormous panorama from lookout,"We drove up to Griffiths Observatory, of who's existence we were completely unaware- had simply googled ""Hollywood sign lookout"". Wish we'd known about it; a working 30's Art Deco telescope observatory with public viewing hours- we'd have scheduled it in! Were unprepared for sheer number of people and cars up there. Our daughter had to drive around for 15 min circling the lot at the top. But, great shots of the sign (w/ telephoto lens), swinging around to behind the observatory and downtown LA. Couldn't hike trails- grandson had broken foot w/ crutches, otherwise would've stayed a lot longer. Outdoor public restrooms a train wreck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tacocands
50,Good walk,"I did the walk that took you up behind the sign. I walked it a reasonably fast pace and completed it within the hour. It is obviously up hill the full way and the temperatures were in the upper 80s, so was good and challenging. The views at the top were amazing and you get good frontal views of the sign on the way up.

40,LA,"Lots of fun. This is quite an uphill hike so bring water, wear good shoes and don't plan on it being a short hike. Great views of Los Angeles from all angles.

50,It's a must see for nothing,this is an worldly icon. Everyone comes to la got to see this sign. No parking available. Better to find parking far away and √ºber up there. Neighbors don't really like all the tourist traffic. Should spend a 30 mins to take pictures and look around. No one is allow to climb up the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
30,Not a good picture spot!,"There were lots of places to see the sign. But it was hard to get a good picture with the sign. The closest (legal) spot, still didn't show up in my pictures.

30,Nice it's a sign,I have heard the stories about the sign and how it might be haunted. But it's just a sign. You can't hike up near it anymore I believe and it's just a sign. yes might be popular to the movie business but to me it's just a sign. so yea eh! Haven't seen it since 2009.,
30,Fenced Off,"Learned the story of the Hollywood Sign on tour with Hollywood Ultimate Tours, it is now fenced off and you can't have your photo taken with it up close.",
50,Finally!,Got a chance to see the Hollywood sign as close as we could! It was a beautiful day in November and it was quiet. We had gone on a Sunday before dinner and quite enjoyed the tranquility of the park. Didn't stay too long but got a chance to take some memorable pictures. Definitely a must see when in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLM36
30,An Interesting Trip by Car!,"I had seen the sign flying into LAX, I had seen the sign from I405 and I had seen the sign from Hollywood Blvd. However, I wanted to see the sign from close up. Well, I set the GPS in my rental car and started up the road, which was an interesting experience. Standard roads about 1/4 of the way up. Then a left turn into a narrow winding mountain road (not quite wide enough for two cars to pass each other) through a residential area with some beautiful homes that are worth looking at. This road is not for the fainthearted. It gets scary at times but if you are ok with driving this type of road, the view that awaits at the end is really worth it. I do recommend taking this drive for something that you can't see from anywhere else in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hairydiver

50,Hiked to the back of the Hollywood sign,"We hiked up Mt. Lee to the back of the Hollywood sign. There are also good views of the front of the sign on the hike, as well as Los Angeles. We started the hike near Sunset Ranch horse farm which took about two hours round trip, including time enjoying the top of the mountain. There are also trails starting from Griffith Observatory parking lot. Hike was HOT so bring some water. Very dry, dusty, no shade, no bathrooms, and signs warning of rattlesnakes.

I drove around Sunset Blvd and Hollywood and Highland Avenue wasting gas for over an hour, then I parked and walked for 30 minutes. No luck. On the way back to my hotel I got a partial view of the sign from the street so I took the picture there. Disappointing. üòï",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissabB2460FT
40,Must see,"A must see as part of any LA trip. You need to habe your own transport to get up to the sign. Some roads leading up there only open to residents, so it was a big tricky reaching there.

50,Viewed from Several Locations,"My children didn't want to do the hike, so we viewed the sign from a drive up to the observatory, a drive up residential streets near the sign, Hollywood & Highland, the Dolby theatre, and along the Hollywood Walk of stars. It was nice to see in person. Included is a picture of the sign with my blue car in it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9590NIjulied
50,Great voews,I personally didn't rate LA after traveling the coast and visiting the likes of San Fran and San Diego......however this walk up to viewing points of the Hollywood sign was definitely worth it. Take plenty water!!!!!,
40,Cool to do,I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. We opted to skip the hike and did the viewpoint address that someone suggested below. It worked just fine for us. Of course it was 100 degrees out so the hike would have been miserable.,
50,Hollywood Lake park,"To see the best view of the Hollywood sign, go to Hollywood Lake Park 3204 Canyon Lake dr, LA, CA 90068",
50,Iconic Pic for the Facebook Album,So we tried to do the hike but it was too hot! We ended up seeing it from the Observatory and it was just as good. If the day is clear you can even see it from Sunset Blvd and take good pics.,
50,Vacation,Needed to see the sign. It's a must to do in LA. Glad I did. Pretty cool attraction. If you have the time then take a look at it.,

Many people on the trail and everyone is very nice. Got up early to do the hike and whether was perfect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648elisem
30,Hollywood sign - Its all right,"As other reviewers have said, its just a sign, in very BIG letters on a hillside. Nothing special but its one of those things that if you go to LA (first trip), you have to visit it and then wonder WHY??!! It was not easy getting to, because there are no signs (ironic) pointing out a way to get to it, so we just saw it from a distance, took some obligatory pictures and that was it. Rather disappointing actually because of all the hype around this humungous sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juhisaxen
50,Excellent views from behind the sign,"The Hollywood Sign is a classic American icon, but the views from the top of the hill behind the sign are the best part. Most of the signs pointing you up to sign will leading you to the classic front view of the sign which is worth seeing. However, about a half mile from the front view of the sign there is a fork in the road, that will lead you up to the rear side of the sign. This will give you gorgeous 360-degree views of LA and the surrounding area, and a sight that should not be missed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattSRob
50,The tour thing to do.,This was one of the stops on our private tour of LA. You can't get too close to the sign but we were able to get the pic we wanted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681sissym

40,They came from Shanghai to see The Hollywood Sign,"I drive for Uber and cover a lot of territory in Los Angeles. I picked up three riders in Santa Monica that wanted to see The Hollywood Sign. The problem is, you can't get up close to it. It is fenced off, has security cameras, if patrolled by Park Rangers and there is always an LAPD on duty, 24/7. The best you can do is go to several points with a nice view of it. Personally, I like the view from The Griffith Park Observatory. But you can also see it well from Lake Hollywood (the reservoir) and going up Beachwood. The sign was built in 1923, to advertise a real estate development called Hollywoodland. In 1932, a young actress jumped off the top of the sign to her death.By the mid 40's the sign was deteriorating. The developers decide to sell their last 450 acres, which include the Sign, and turn it over to the City of Los Angeles. The Sign becomes a part of Griffith Park. In 1949, work was done to repair the sign and to remove ""land"", so it became The Hollywood Sign. In 1973, it was declared a Historical Landmark. In 1978, Hugh Hefner hosted a fundraiser to rebuild the sign. It cost $27,000 to sponsor one letter. Alice Cooper sponsored an ‚ÄúO‚Äù in honor of Groucho Marx. In August of 1978, the old Sign is demolished and for the first time in more than 50 years, Angelenos are without the Sign for three months. November 1978,the new Sign, four stories high, 450-feet long and weighing 480,000 lbs., is unveiled on Hollywood‚Äôs 75th Anniversary celebration in November 1978 live to a television audience of 60 million. Hugh Hefner stepped in once more, with a donation to buy the 138 acres behind the sign to preserve it forever. Several other companies donated for this as well. So there you have it... a brief history of this icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Walk up behind the sign for sunset,"Walked up behind the sign for a great view of the city. Stayed afew hours for sunset. Was very windy and cold, take a jacket and food if you plan to stay awhile. Great easy hike up and back",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rineeb
30,It's okay,Seeing the Hollywood sign is Something you should seebbut definitely do not make it a top priority if you are short on time. There is nothing to do there but see the sign take a photo and leave. Only reason to see this because it's iconic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracO5470UY

40,Must do,"One of the highlights on our trip was going to see the Hollywood Sign at sunset. We drove to Griffith Observatory on a beautiful evening. Our only problem was that everyone else had the same idea! Traffic was heavy and parking was an issue. It took us about 20-25 minutes to get to the top and to find parking. Let me tell you, it was well worth it. The sun was setting and the sky was orange. It was tranquil. We took so many great shots of the Hollywood Sign. A wonderful memory for all of us to cherish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9811LScarolp
40,See From a Viewpoint,"I wasn't really sure where to put this review, because we didn't go right up to the Hollywood sign, but on the other hand reviewing the good viewpoints would be a problem because they weren't meant to be such. It therefore made sense to put it here.As you probably know, this is an icon of Hollywood and LA, probably the most famous landmark in the metropolis. The sign is open to the public and there is a hiking trail leading up to it. However, it's 3+ km from the closest place where you're likely to find parking, and as far as I know there is no public transportation anywhere close, so keep in mind that if you don't take a taxi, it's a long hike through the neighborhood until you see nature.In light of that, what we did was pick the closest good vantage point to see the sign. The area of Sunset Ranch Hollywood is one such vantage point. If you don't intend to enter the ranch itself (we didn't), come very early and you will find parking somewhere in the neighborhood (beware, parking is illegal on most streets and they often have no-parking hours). Hollyridge Drive is a good bet.You will then need to go up a dirt trail (unmarked) and eventually reach a sort of midpoint where you can see the sign. The view from there is quite good in the morning, and I doubt there is a better one that's reasonably accessible. I wish there was some kind of orderly observation point, it's not a stretch to image one from where both the sign and the city would be easily visible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey

50,Spectacular view of the DOOWYLLOH sign,"I have been trying to get a good view of the Hollywood sign for many years, and I finally found the right platform!We set off from Griffith Canyon parking lot early on a cool day in LA, and hiked the unpaved, wide path up the canyon. The wildflowers and increasingly more impressive views of LA were a treat along the steep path.At the top of the canyon walk there were two published viewing points for the sign, but both provided only partial views at an angle. We continued up the service road to the top of Mount Lee to be treated to a spectacular view of LA and the rear of the Hollywood sign. It was well worth the significant climb (1500 feet) to appreciate that view!We had the canyon almost to ourselves on the way up, but later in the morning there were school groups and horse riders on the trail as well.I didn't see any sign of water, so make sure you take enough for a strenuous hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zucchinigirl
40,HELLOOO! HOLLYWOOD!!,"You cannot go to Los Angeles and NOT visit the Hollywood Sign the symbol of Golden Age Hollywood. It is spelt in huge white 45 ft. tall capital letters, and is situated on Mount Lee in the Hollywood Hills. Griffith Park, and Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery are situated next to it. The sign when observed at ground level has a sort of wavy appearance due to the silhouettes of the hills behind, and has featured in many films and TV programmes. Hollywoodland as it was formerly named, was created as an advertisement for a local real estate development in 1923. It was studded with approx. 4000 light bulbs which would flash and light up ‚ÄúHolly Wood Land‚Äù, individually and then entirely! The sign has since been rebuilt, and largely restored due to the public campaign by Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine. There are security systems and closed-circuit cameras installed to prevent you venturing right up to the sign ‚Äì so be cautious. Yesteryear actress Peg Entwistle committed suicide by climbing to the top of the alphabet ‚ÄòH‚Äô and jumping to her death. Any movement in the restricted area will trigger an alarm and get the cops after you. A great photo-opportunity not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jp
50,Its A Sign,"It's a big white sign in bold letters that says Hollywood. Surprisingly, it is not easily visible from the city streets, but you do get an occasional glimpse between buildings.I was told the it was possible to drive up to it, but the road was narrow and not of the best quality.So I had to content myself with a few photos of the sign from between the buildings.",
50,Iconic,"Hard to get a truly good view, but nonetheless it is a must see. Look up the best places for the best views in the city. I was at Highland and we had a great shot.",
40,Iconic Hollywood Sign,"If you are in Hollywood, you will never miss this iconic sign which has become synonymous with the place and a huge tourist attraction. What was initially put up as an advertisement by a real estate company has now become symbol of Hollywood. There are different vantage points to have a clear view of the sign and for the more adventurous you can actually hike all the way up to the sign board.",
40,Just a big sign,We saw the sign while on a Hollywood tour but could only see it from a distance. Each letter stands 45 feet and it use to be the sign for a local real estate development and was subject to being vandalized often. You cannot get close to the sign as it is protected by The Trust For Public Land a non profit organization and is part of Griffith Park. A must see for the bucket list.,
50,Hollywood tour,We take the tour with Hollywood four and had a great time with the entire family. Eddie was our tour guide and he was great,
10,Why does everyone want to see this stupid sign?,You have to go on a pretty significant hike to get close to the sign itself. You can get a pretty good view from the Griffith Park observatory. Or try going to the damn at Lake Hollywood Reservoir. Just don't drive through the neighborhoods looking for access. It pissed people off.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panama2000
40,"HOLLYWOOD SIGN, a Legible Proper Noun","My experience with the Hollywood sign was something short of riveting. Much like other words, phrases, and place names that are read using the sense of sight (as opposed to hearing the spoken word), the sign changed very little, if at all the more I experienced it. My first encounter with the sign was most likely in childhood when I saw it on either a TV show or perhaps a movie...in all honesty, unlike most of you, I don't recall my first experience with the sign. It's like it has always been a part of my life and in my memories. On a recent trip to LA, I saw the sign from somewhere near that Chinese man theatre. Seeing it in real life was somewhat different. I noticed right off the bat that the sign is in a sans serif font, suggesting a casualness and openness to the reader. I didn't realize that the letters were so askew. Surely the Los Angeles geniuses that established this distinct, meaningful place name icon wouldn't construct this in an intentionally crooked manner. Did an earthquake do this? Perhaps its slanted nature is a metaphor to Hollywood not being that ""straight""? I decided I needed to get closer. Maybe a view of the sign less obstructed by LA smog would better reveal its perfect prose.2 miles and 57 minutes later I approached the sign just above the less than pristine Lake Hollywood. Wow! Like the E at the top of my optometrist's chart the sign was right there, directly in front of me! Precariously perched on a hill, nestled between a dog park and a large antennae was the iconic structure recognizable world over. I found it difficult to frame my photograph in a manner that avoided both the antennae and the terrier that was sniffing the golden doodle's behind. I needed to get a little closer, and a short drive into a residential neighborhood allowed for just that.OMG!! I'm really here, directly below the HOLLYWOOD sign! There are two houses that are so close that a mudslide would certainly allow a falling ""O"" to wipe them from their foundations. From here I can notice some subtle differences. It appears that WOOD is setback somewhat from HOLLY...an observation only I and the lucky souls living directly beneath this icon can experience. 3D is so much better than 2D. Hmmm, was the installation crew on meth when they put the ""D"" in? This looks like HOLLYWOO D. Come on now you artsy Hollywood promoters with your enchanting visual siren song! I'll give you your wavy, asymmetric place marker. I won't even insist it be in Modern Language Association format. But for God's sake don't put an unintentional spacebar in the middle of your word on the side of a mountain! How can an entire construction crew fat finger this job???!!In summary, I found this outing to be appropriate for couples, families with young children, or newly arrived Asians. 4 of 5 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorm470
40,Movie Land,It was pretty awesome seeing a monumental part of Hollywood and being able to take pictures. I just wish the area where you can look out of the telescope was bigger. It was too many people up there at one time. It was hard to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/y2naya
50,So cool!,It was so cool to see the Hollywood sign up close!! I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting LA to take a look! You won't regret it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C7342YVlauram
50,The famous sign,Parking was horrible so the people I was with park a little ways down from griffith observatory. Walked up to the observatory took a few pics and decided to hike the trails closer to the sign. The hike was about 3 to 4 miles and it was a hot day out. I enjoyed the hike up there met some people and we talked and hiked all the way to the sign. I recommend you pack the right shoes and bring lot of water! Even though a park ranger drive around the trails and hands out water or drives people back when they can't keep going anymore. I recommend you pack a lot of water in a bag. It's was a great experience and I would do this hike over again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/827omarg
50,Hollywood,We went to the Griffith Observatory to get a better view of the sign and take pictures. It's a very pretty area.,
30,Cool,"It's a definite must see if you are in LA, it is just a big sign, and it can be a little underwhelming. It's definitely cool though!I would recommend visiting the Griffith observatory for the best views. We went on a Monday afternoon and while it was still busy, it wasn't obscene and you could get some good photos.",
40,Don't go to where the sign is...,"So we didn't actually go up to the mountain where the signage is located, but the best way to view the sign is actually by going to the observatory. There you have a better/great view and can take photos and also a lovely panoramic view of Los Angeles. It's free and not get hated by the exclusive community that live up on the hill. Your welcome! :)",
30,Not as great as I thought it would be,"The sign is not as big as I imagined, it's high up on the hill and it's hard to see it from the Theatre where all the tourists go to view it. Still, it's worth seeing and getting a photo with when you're in Hollywood.",
30,Viva las vegas,I turned to my wife aswel were driving into LA and said first one to spot it wins a tenner. Think Blackpool Tower! Anyway you do its on the hillside and it's very exciting to start. But once you get on Sunset you forget about it. Its quite strange. It's a defo on the list to see but once is good enough,
30,The Sign!,"I was not sure what to expect, but I was unprepared for the view. Its further than I thought but atop the conservatory, the view was amazing! You can hike to the sign, 4 miles each way, but I was not wearing the right shoes! I would like to go back and walk the trail, just for the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiat470
20,"It a Sign, just a sign.",After a 15 minute drive up the the top we were still nowhere near the sign. My advice would be to use a zoom lens from the bottom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197andyn
40,Do not go to the sign see if from the park,"You can see the Hollywood sign just fine from the Griffith Observatory, worth seeing because of the iconic nature of it but a little underwhelming. Our hotel manager told us it can be unsafe to be up there and very crowded so you can not get a good photo anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppynic
10,A sign is a sign,It really isn't worth driving or walking around town just to get close enough to take a photo of an old sign. There are better things to do with your time whilst on holiday. Get a photo with the picture at universal studios instead (there is one when you end the back stage tour). And it's prettier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liseyl
30,Iconic,"Saw it from the Griffith Observatory, worth seeing because of the iconic nature of it but a little underwhelming. Smog covered too, like everything in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDKRN
50,Its Sign,Not really much you can say about this. It can been seen from several places in Hollywood due to its location,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leyshao
30,It was ok,"This was an ok trip. Sadly we couldnt get really close to the sign. It was very crowded which was ok, but the atmosphere was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tiffanyj710
50,Big,Big letters in the mountain . Our private tour knew a place where no tourist go so it was fantastic to see them as nearer as you could.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OlivierC229
40,Worthy to go,A worthy to go place due to this sign is shown in many movies. But the location we find still very far from the sign so when taking photos with the sign it looks very small. Got to find a nice place very near it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agneschaotw
20,Just a sign,Nothing spectacular. You can see it at a lot of places. Closest you can get is at griffins observatory. But driving up is a nightmare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alencia
40,Iconic But Better From a Distance,You obviously have to see the Hollywood sign when in LA (its hard to miss it). However I think the best views of it are from the mall on the Hollywood Strip.You can get right up to the sign on a walk through the hills but once there you can't really see anything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trigger85
50,You Should Go,"one of the most important places to go when you visit LA, noce vier and nice feeling to be there, don't miss that amazing feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bill_S_TB
40,hiking up to the sign,We zig zagged are way through the streets below the sign to get to a close vantage point. There were no footpaths but the homes were very nice. We got to point where there was a dirt track with a chain across it with no access for cars. We walked until we got good photos of the sign. There were no trespassing signs everywhere so we didn't go any farther but we saw some people further along the track.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/983patriciao

40,just had to see it,"its just something you have to do, you see it on the telly so many times so you have to take a look its just great",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/553julied
50,7:50 pm in May Breathtaking Sunsets,"Park along the street and be prepared for an uphill hike up the street. Worth it! Stop along the way for amazing views of the city, the observatory, and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoastinAndToastin
40,A terrific way see an iconic landmark and get some exercise,"Start out early to avoid the crowds on the weekends. We parked at the Griffith Observatory car park and decided to walk the many off-road trails toward the Hollywood sign. Be sure to use the toilet facilities near the Observatory, as there aren't any along the trails or at the sign. We started off about 10am, with the marine layer (early morning cloud cover) still providing some respite from the sun. We walked for about 2.5 hours mostly over uneven ground, climbing like mountain goats in some sections. The terrain can be very flaky, and would not be something to attempt in wet weather. Once at the sign the view was terrific. Depending on the route taken, you can also see to the eastern side of Griffith Park overlooking Glendale and Burbank to the north. We spent about 30 mins at the top enjoying the cooling breeze. The walk down only took 1.5 hours and was made significantly easier and less strenuous as we decided to walk along the sealed road. Quite a few families with young children were using this route to also walk up to the sign. Sun protection and water is definitely required and there were some water refill locations on the way along the more defined trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buzz69Melbourne
30,Not Worth Visiting,"While the famous sign is good from a distance, visiting it is not worth your time --highly overrated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithp867
40,Iconic,"It's a must for any first time visitor to the Los Angeles area. It can be difficult to get a good view of the sign, but I would recommend taking a trip to the Griffith Observatory if you have the time. It has one of the best views in the city and it is very easy to photograph the Hollywood sign from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeFeeny
50,A must see,You can't go to Hollywood and not get a good view of the sign. We stopped at a great viewing spot with a Hollywood tour company that I highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielwS2999OT
20,Nothing special.,"Believe me, its smaller than you think! There are no signposts directing you to the best view, In fact the only view where you can the entire sign is down a side street on a housing estate! A disappointment like almost everything in LA. Get in a car, get out of LA and drive highway 1 to san fran now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevensal779
40,Icon worth seeing,It's more impressive as you approach closerI'm not sure you can say that you were in Los AngelesWithout seeing it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidT1978
10,NAFF,"Can't see the Hollywood sign from the observatory, it looks like a pea!! You get a better view of the Basildon sign when you visit there and that is a dump!! Just let us nearer your precious sign or stop showing it on TV.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LJB222
50,Surreal!,Visited her recently after travelling from LA to Vegas etc and this was the highlight of my holiday! You dont know what it's like until you are standing underneath it in real life! It's truly amazing to see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylieDoran
40,Hollywood Sign,Such an iconic place 2 see. Canyon Lake dr has a great view and a great photo spot. You can walk up into the windy roads for an even better shot. Ignore the 'go away tourists' signs though.,
40,Hard to get to,"With heavy traffic on Hollywood Boulevard and a possibility of sitting in traffic for hours we decided to see you close we could get to the sign. Using a paper map from the tourist office we drove up, down and round the hills till we got to Lake Hollywood Park. From that vantage point you get a good picture of the sign. Watch out for the park ranger and be aware that these are narrow, twisty side streets with little space to manoeuvre. Must have took a good 45 minutes from to get there and longer to get out, it's a bit like a maze. Enjoyable though.",
50,DO THE HIKE,"Watching the sign from a distance is a pretty view but to get the best of the whole experience, do complete the hike. The hike is nothing but a walk with a very manageable climb in the end. Nothing much to look there, but if you have time on hand, why not. Loved the view of LA from the top, and also a glimpse of the ocean",
40,A must see,A trip to LA would be highly incomplete without a glimpse of this Hollywood sign. There are numerous locations from where you could catch a glimpse of this. The Dolby theatre at Hollywood provides one of the best views of this. There are also many hiking trails leading up to the sign.,
40,Landmark,"It is a must-go place if you visit LA for the first time, although I was a little bit disappointed when I finally saw it. Maybe I imagined it to be way more glamorous. You can see the sign from various places, I first saw it on the highway when we were heading towards hollywood. And then saw it again while walking on the walk of fame and again from the griffith observatory.",
30,Hollywood Sign,"Unless you are a good hiker and want to break some rules, you are only able to see it's from a district.Tours do not go up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jsb53
40,Hard to get too,We went here to try and get close to the sign but you are unable to get right up to it in a car the access up there is tight winding narrow roads. It's worth the drive out and fun to drive round the holiwood hill anyway. But try the sunset ranch for a horse ride up there you get quite close and the rides fun too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thesaint73
30,Take a quick look,"Not really much more than you'd imagine. Big letters, spell the town name. Not worth taking the trip; take a look when you're in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonL40
50,Hollywood sign on horseback,"Being from Kentucky horses are in our blood. We rode up to the sign out of Circle K riding stables in Burbank. The trip was a few hours of really nice trails and views. The horses were well trained and kept. You don't get right next to the sign but get a good view and pictures of it. The price was reasonable and beginners would do fine. If you are looking for an alternate to see the sign, this is it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kysecretsquirrel
20,"Lovely view, but don't waste too much time going there.","In hindsight, probably wouldn't go out of my way to spend much of my holiday time doing this again.Obviously it's a good place for a photo/selfie - but you can't actually get very close to the logo at all. There is an observation area/platform where everyone drive's up to to take a photo, but you're so far away that it becomes very difficult to take a photo where the camera can actually keep the famous Hollywood sign in focus in the background.There is lots of room for parking to be fair, so you don't have to wait for ages for people to move out of the way to take your photo. Also, you do get great views over Hollywood. At night time it's quite beautiful to look over Hollywood with all the buildings lit up. Be careful it's not bad weather, or you might not be able to see the sign very well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimPJim
50,Straight Out of the Movies,"I would recommend visiting during the week as there are less people and parking is accessible(On the street). My friends and I found a parking right away upon arrival. There weren't too many cars parked near by as it was a Thursday afternoon. We walked over to the area where everyone was taking photos(still about an hour away from the sign-walking). There was a nice gentleman by the name of Dave or David I believe it is who was kindly taking photos of everyone(free of charge) with their own devices. He takes them rather well; I recommend it. He also told us to get really close to the sign we had to hike up about an hour. We chose to hike up and there are a lot of signs telling you no to trespass, but Dave said it is fine to go any way(A lot of others were also ignoring the signs). He also kindly showed us the way. We got really close not all the way. There is also a man named Guy who sells beverages out of his garage on the way. He was really nice - also recommended by Dave.The sign and the views a long the way are a must. It is literally straight out of the movies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/datdpb
50,Finally found it,We took lots of pictures in front of this iconic image. My wife and daughter loved seeing it in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7808BillyD

50,Beautiful and scenic place.,We took a Starline paid tour to the Beverly Hills celebrity area which took us to a scenic point facing the hollywood sign on top of the mountain. I don't think there is anything else to do on the top of the mountain with hollywood sign. The sign is seen from couple of places and streets of the hollywood city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hridayav
50,A must see if you are in Hollywood!,If you are in Hollywood this is a must see as it is so well known that how could you pass it up! You can see it from Hollywood Blvd and also they have tours that will take you where you can get a great view of it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arlinda78
50,Hike,Awesome hike with great views. A must for locals and out of towner's. Hike is moderate. Great pictures taking of downtown and Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlackRoseCher
50,Hollywood Sign,"We drove to go & see the Hollywood sign. I apologize I don't remember what street we were on when we took the picture, it was pretty cool. I think you can see the sign when your on Hollywood Blvd near the Grauman's Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160dawnz
30,Bit of a let down,"One gets the impression that this sign can be reached, but not the case. Nearest we could get was at the Griffiths Observatory, but we saw it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianneKamerling

40,Iconic,We went to the sign part of a private LA tour so we saw this from a little known sight and closer than expected. An iconic part of Hollywood that is a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daiseesmom
50,Classic,Visit the hills opposite the sign to get the best and classic view of the sign and the LA skyline. There's. Little bit of a bribe out of downtown LA and a little hike from parking to the viewing platform but it's well worth it!,
40,Great to see,The Griffith Observatory is a perfect spot to get a good distance view of the Hollywood sign. Some can hike up to it but it was closed for us but didn't matter. Still got a few good photos of the sign overlooking Hollywood.,
40,A place to visit once just to say you did:),"It is a hike to get a good photo of the Hollywood sign, but if you just want the photo... you can zoom in and get a good shot right from the highway lol. As far as Hollywood area itself, there is not as much to see as I thought there would be, and although the stores and shops are nice, the streets are dirty and overcrowded. That being said, I would still recommend visiting the Hollywood area once for the experience. One day would be enough for the average traveler or family, perhaps longer if you are persuing a career in performing arts. Getting free tickets to a live taping of Jimmy Kimmel or other shows is pretty easy online a few days prior. Public transportation is cheap and easy to get around, although be prepared to see some pretty scary neighborhoods if you decide to venture out on a bus! There are also a lot of homeless people in the area, but most are nice and respectful. Enjoy the people watching and don't judge a book by it's cover:) Have some cash available for tipping street performers!",
40,Get close near the Observatory,"While you certainly can see the sign from a distance, and it is cool to see such an iconic sign, you need to get close. You can drive up/hike up closer to the sign by going to the Observatory. You can typically drive most of the way, but then parking is tight so you will end up walking part of the way. It was a nice little walk, and there are other hikes you can take once you are up there. You can also have a good view of the city as well from the Observatory. So worth the time if you ask me.",
30,hiked up to the hollywood sign,"We hiked up the trail to the hollywood sign. It was only when we were going back down that the fact that there were no railings and the trail was very narrow, really kicked in.",
40,Great view,We tried to visit the Hollywood sign but we can just got close. We loved the view by the Griffith observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gris573
40,Far to reach i guess,"I ddnt get the chance to get to the sign since it was far and bushy, we had to climb to get there and that wasn't my plan.. i only took a picture of it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SultanaBeirut
50,Hike to the Hollywood sign on Mothers day,"We goggled the hike to the Hollywood sign and it was worth the trip out. The hike is moderate with the first portion of the hike a little steep but not bad, I'm in my mid 40's and my 13 year old kids made it with no issues. The rest of the hike is flat with great views of Downtown LA and Santa Monica bay on a clear day. Walking at a moderate speed the hike took us approx. 3.5 hours, that is including stopping to take photos through out the hike. I would recommend starting this hike between 7-8am. There are also trails that will take you to the Griffith Observatory but we didn't have time for that. At the base of the hike there are maps so you can figure out your hike, I recommend taking a photo with your phone, there are also plenty of other people in case you get lost. From the time we left out house in Whittier to the time we came back home it was about a 5 hour outing. We all enjoyed the hike and the View, highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352rickm
50,Just like s movie,The best view is just s short spin up mulholland drive. Defo worth a spin if you're in Hollywood. Great photo opportunities en route.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michaeltmbyrne
50,Hollywood Sign on Horseback,"Do it for the sights, do it for the exercise! We rode out of Griffith Park Horse Rentals in the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. Sweeping views of Burbank and Glendale, views of the Observatory, downtown LA and of course, from across the canyon, the Hollywood sign. Definitely recommended for out of town guests that know how to ride or are in pretty good physical shape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clydeclyde

30,It's a hike to get to but good exercise,"OK you can't actually touch the Hollywood sign, it's illegal, big wire fences, threatening signs, and a police chopper flying around help enforce it. But the road/trail does lead up to a little dirt mound behind and above it at the top of the hill where one can take photos and say been there done that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvToEatTheBest
40,Good view from the Dolby Theatre Complex,You get a good view of the Hollywood sign from the Dolby Theatre Complex. Go up to the fourth floor. A good photo shot from there.

20,Big disappointment!,We had expectation of viewing the sign up close. The photo spot was on opposite hill and the sign was barely visible clearly. Came to know during the tour that people are not allowed to go close by. the possible good view is from the observatory nearby but it seems that that needs good walk in heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/243paragn
50,The hike of my life,My daughter dragged me up the steep slopes to go behind the sign. It was I think it was called Mount Lee It was quite a steep climb but the pain was quickly dispersed by the increasingly stunning views of the city which in my opinion cannot be beaten. At the very top there are no barriers to stop you falling off the steep drops so keep your children and pets close. There are no toilets so be prepared!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elinorheasman

40,Must Have Picture,"If u r going to visit Hollywood, u must get a picture of the Hollywood Sign. A good place to get it is at the Hollywood Highland Center Mall. At the outside portion of the mall, off Holywood Blvd, there are several levels you can see the sign from. You can take an escalator to one of the levels and get a good shot of the sign. If u go, make sure it's a clear day. The afternoon tends to be better after the morning haze burns off.

50,"Didn't make it, but got a great pic","I would recommend this to anyone. If you have to time when you're in Los Angeles, hike up to the sign. I've seen friends pics. Great views. Nice hike.

50,Great icon to America,"The sign is great and you can really see it all throughout Los Angeles. However, there are three amazing spots (and closer) other than Hollywood Blvd where you can see the sign. Either from Griffith Observatory, or take the 3 mile hike from there to get behind the sign (the best views!) or from the dog park down below at Lake Hollywood Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hawadjie
50,Must See,We were able to view from Mulholland Drive and The Observatory. We took our exchange student because she really wanted US experience. Just a fun picture to have!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drkathyj
50,As Legendary as Hollywood Itself,"You can get a good view from Griffith Observatory, or you can take the wonderful Ultimate Hollywood Tour and be driven up to a much closer site. Regardless, It has to be seen to be believed. You won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/area51619

40,Nice hiking,We took an Uber to the gate. There is a gard there but he was very nice and directed us where to go. We walked inside the gate and walked passed the pic-nic tables and the trail is starts on the right. You will be climbing for the first 15- 20 minutes and then it flattens out a bit. Don't forget to bring water. There is a small market at the bottom of the hill but if you are on food and it about 15 minutes from there. Since we had forgotten our water we took a shorter route. It was nice and sunny and we met a group on horseback.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JsHappytravels
40,Longer than I thought... SO. WORTH. IT!,"Walked from West Hollywood all the way up to the back of the sign and back amounting a 6 and a half hike. Definitely recommend bringing loads of water and some snacks to have at the top. For the best views always follow ""Back of the Hollywood sign"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a2afelipe
40,Worth seeing.,It's a sign which we had been seeing since childhood is worth being watched from different places in Los Angeles specially from a small bridge where they have fixed a telescope now. This bridge or balcony is dividing two buildings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mohammadi2014
40,Must see spot,If you come to Los Angeles you can't skip the sign. We didn't get that close and the next time we will take a tour bus to get us closet so we can get some good photos. The sign is on television all the time so it is good to go take a look for yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josemartinez3171
40,"Gotta see it in person, get your pictures and move on.","Our family's first trip to Hollywood had to include seeing the Hollywood sign. Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it looks like it looks in the pictures you see everywhere, but a trip to Hollywood isn't complete without a visit. We parked at the Griffith Park Observatory and took in the great views of the city and then walked up the path to get a bit closer to the sign. The paths at the Observatory aren't going to get you super close to the sign but considering each letter is 45' tall, you'll see the sign just fine from the vantage point provided by those paths. If you want to get closer, you apparently can but seeing the sign from this distance was good enough for us. There's a free large parking lot at the observatory that you can park at and there are bathrooms available near the parking lot as well. If you want to skip the mild hike, you can certainly get a photo done right in the parking lot with the sign off in the distance. The hike was easy and can be done with any kind of shoes. I wouldn't want to do it when it's 90+ degrees, but when we visited in March, it was around 70 and the hike was very enjoyable. So, one way or another, see it in person, get your picture and move on to the other sights available to enjoy in the Hollywood / Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssy24
30,It looked like the picture,There is nothing to say. People got very excited to see this sign that we see every time anything from Hollywood emerges but I could not join in the fun. Maybe I was in a bad mood that day. (shrug),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ketsiat
30,Either challenging walk or twisty drive,"Although there are blogs describing how to get there via a 90 min walk, parking is a big problem. There is security at top of Nr Beachwood Drive, to stop cars going up the dirt road, they tell you you need to park at bottom of hill, further 45 mins away.We drove round to Lakeland dr, dog park and took pics of the sign from there and we missed out the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonh267
40,Great view from Griffith Park Observatory.,The closest I got to the sign was from the Griffith Park Observatory. Not sure of other locations but this one was just fine. Lots of photo ops and the view of the city is great from here too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WayneDiane

50,Excellent hike.,I took the hike on a friends recommendation. It was a little longer then I expected. But it wasn't all that difficult of a hike. Plus the views were nice. There were 2 options to see the sign. I opted for the view up to the sign. There is also a path for a view from the top down. If I had the time I might have done that as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juice_22

30,Iconic sign,We got plenty of pictures of the infamous sign but none from close up.You can see it from multiple places around the city and you can't get up close to it anymore as it is all fenced off and protected.Worth getting some photos of but I wouldn't recommend travelling specifically for it. Although you can get some good pics if your going up to the Griffiths observatory.One for the picture album.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glenc360

50,Hollywood Hills here I come!,Best viewed perhaps from Griffith Park Observatory - great to see this iconic image in the palm of your hand (with a little adjusting in the camera frame). Many people flock to the hilltop observatory for an evening view of the sun setting behind the sign. Beautiful. Hang around until the sun goes down to see a fabulous nighttime site over downtown Los Angeles. Spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KateJourney
10,too far away,"I'm glad i can say I've been, because it's one of those iconic things, but you can't get very close at all. In fact my favourite thing was the nice walk up the Griffith Observatory and then you see the sign and go ""o yeah"", but then you just carry on walking. Don't go out of your way to see it because it's really hard focussing a camera with you in the shot whilst still being able to read the sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jarvo2001
40,From Griffith Observatory,"If you visit the Griffith Observatory you can see the Sign from there, which is nice. Not sure about the other places to see the sign.

30,Cool experience,"It doesn't light up at night or have anything else around it.To some it might be boring, but it is a fun experience.

30,"Great Hike, Iconic! With a Warning.","If you don't live in Los Angeles or watch local news, know this: The Hollywood sign is one of the most famous hikes, next to Runyon Canyon(which is closed currently). It is also a hike with no public facilities, parking, or water stations. So come prepared.The other thing you need to keep in mind is the entrance to the trail is in a residential area, and as of late, they are irritated. Too much congestion, too many people, and it's just all too much, for them. So, be polite, because you are in someone elses backyard. Parking is no picnic on the streets, just know that if you plan to make this hike on a weekend, avoid it like the plague.All though some of the residents are nice enough to help those who come and go to the trail, it is not their obligation - TRY NOT TO DISTURB THE NICE FOLKS WHO LIVE THERE!However, if you're fortunate enough to get to the sign, the vistas are great! And on a clear day, you can see straight out to Palos Verdes.It's a fun hike, lovely view, however, the drawbacks of parking and public facilities makes it difficult to give it a higher rating. You need to know that getting to the sign is all about the view of it, you're not allowed to go on it or even touch it.I can however recommend another hike to Lake Hollywood, no sign, but a better hike. With parking just off the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
30,Fenced in so no acces to sign itself.,"If you plan on getting close then you will have a hike. The tours that claim to get you there stop on Mulholland about as close as you can get from the freeway. You can not touch the sign so don't plan on that awesome photo of you sitting on the ""O""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
40,The Sign,"Not much to review, other than you can't go to Hollywood and not see the sign. It is just about as iconic as it gets and can be seen from afar and up close. Missing it would be like going to DC and not seeing the White House, if only to take a picture and say ""I was there.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexWorldTraveler
40,Best place to see the sign is Canyon Lake Drive,"To get the best view of the sign put 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood into your sat nav. This will take you to a dog park on your left and there's free on street parking here. Park here and then walk up the hill to get a bit closer. There's no parking further up the hill so this is the best place to leave your car. The view from here is brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollieC648
20,Good luck,Very hard to find a good spot to get a picture of the sign as you can't really get close to it. We drove for quiet some time and the right spot was too busy with cars to get any pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabienP270

I am so humbled that I was able to see this sign and I cannot say enough what a magical experience it was. I feel like I accomplished a major objective in my life - and I was not disappointed. It's a six mile hike by foot, but I joined a Hollywood sightseeing bus tour and got close enough to take a few pictures that I will always cherish!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyJ140
50,Take a picture,"You can see it and take pictures from Hollywood walk of fame, there is a mall there that you have to walk it to inside and take a picture there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NevinTorky
40,A ritual for travellers,"well there is no perfect viewing spot of the sign because believe me , you will be miles away from it even when you are the closest. A hike is not necessary to view the sign if you are not up for it. It can simply be viewed from from the rear of the Hollywood & Highland Center Mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/507aditid
50,See it at Sunset !!!,"We drove around the Hollywood Hills looking for a perfect view of the iconic sign nestled into the hillside. There are several places to park in residential areas for that quick photo shoot. We worked our way towards the Griffiths Observatory for our best, although distant view, of the sign as the sunset over Los Angeles. Seeing the sign was a bucket list moment for us. We thought it would be huge and dominating the hillside but it is just visible on the distance and appears a little smaller than you think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarmaladeFella

30,Not Worth the Hike,"The elusive Hollywood sign is quite the hike. I personally was in no shape to undertake such a hike so I didn't. Anyway, it could be a fun family trip to drive up there. Yes, I would recommend driving there. Otherwise have a good zoom lens to get a shot from far away. It was my first time in LA so I had to at least see it. It's just one of those annoying tourist attractions that you have to look for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754dianeh
50,Great Hike to Iconic Site,"A must-go for any visitor to -- or resident of -- LA. Choose from either a 1.5 hour or 3.5 hour hike, the shorter one on the Western entrance (end of Beachwood Canyon) at the Sunset Stables, the longer one at the end of (plain old) Canyon Drive. When you get to the very top, you can look one way in the San Fernando Valley and the other way into the LA Basin (Valley of the 1000 Smokes), all the way to Catalina on a clear day.

40,Worth the effort,"This Hollywood sign is a not-so-easy place to reach. You should find the best way to reach the nearest spot. We pass along Melrose Avenue to discover that it was the best way to go there. From there you can also visit the Griffith Observatory. If you are not opt on going to that high place, you can very well see the sign from the Observatory where you can have a nice glimpse of the sign for picture-taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaricorDG
40,Hiked up behind the letters,"My husband and I wanted to do the hike up behind the letters. First problem: Parking. We had to park miles away in a side street and walk. It was about a 15 min walk just from our car park to the place where the hike started. There were lots of other tourists doing the same thing, we just kinda followed the crowd.The second thing that could be a problem is the lack of signage. There are a few trails in that area and we weren't 100% sure which one would lead us up past the letters. We happened to pick the right one, but a few signs would help.Overall though, this is a free attraction and an icon of LA, so totally worth the walk and the parking hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilovefrance12
50,hollywood,"i went sightseeing the ""hollywood"" sign from the mall for free, but i recommend you go near.The sign from the mall looks too tiny and some wire interrupt you in a view.There are some tour bus that you can go closer, it would be a better choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbbbbb
50,Beautiful Sight,"It was awesome to see the Hollywood Sign which is something I've seen on tv for years. We viewed it from the Griffith Observatory and that had a great vantage point. You can't get all that close to the sign, legally, so this sufficed. Great views of the city from the area near the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYC2VA13
50,"Excellent Hike, You'll Probably Get a Ticket","First, my mistake was not doing any research on the Hollywood sign before attempting the hike. We just kind of showed up where other cars were stopped and saw people hiking uphill. We thought...sure, this won't be too tough we got this!The hike is not difficult, there are some steep grades here and there, but the path is very well laid down. Plus the number of people walking it makes it fairly obvious where to go. It is a lot longer of a hike than we were expecting, so definitely allot yourself plenty of time and if you have weaker walkers in your group, plan for stops. However the views and photos ops along this hike are great and lend themselves to those stops. I like the twilight hike the best starting in the early afternoon, walking back in the dark was a pain, but worth it. Great views, can be a little crowded at the top, probably depending on the time.Finally, be careful where you park, you may not realize that it's a no parking zone and LA does love their parking violations!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbuford04

50,Had to see it,"Well if in Las Angeles I reckon one must see the Hollywood Sign if you have the time. Pretty cool to see, hard to locate if you don't know the area. Saw it took a bunch of pics, would I go back, probably not, one of these attractions that you only need to see one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ottr60
50,One of the best hikes on our round the world trip!,"We hike the Hollywood sign for 0.50c, no tour guides needed and it was an amazing and rewarding experience!We took the DASH bus from Holllywood/Vine to Beachwood Canyon and took a short walk to the official trail from here. It took around 2-3 hours in total and the views at the top behind the sign are spectacular! One of the best view points in Los Angeles by far! The hike is moderate-strenuous depending on the weather, we went in the morning and it was a lot cooler and the typical LA fog came in to help cool us down. It heats up at around 12, take plenty of water, energy snacks and good shoes.Come back down via Mulholland Drive for a great view of the sign from the front which is the closest you can get to the sign before you hit the fence barriers.",
50,Nice View,"it was fun to see the sign, as you see it in so many movies. it's exactly the same. :-) its an icon in CA",
40,Feel like a hike?,There is a starting point further down Franklin Blvd after visiting the Observatory. The hike is a series of fire break switch backs up the Hollywood hills. Parking at the base is severely limited with many parking down the narrow streets. Watch out where you park as many homeowners are tired of the traffic and the hikers.You can no longer hike to the sign itself and have to settle for pictures just below it. Good for a morning or afternoon hike on a week day. Stay away on weekends if you can.,
50,Hollywood sign: Great up close!,"On my second trip to LA, I took a long hike with friends through the hills (called ""Santa Monica Mountains"") around the Griffith Park Conservatory. At the end of our hike, we ended up at a lookout point: which was incredibly close to the Hollywood sign! It was amazing to be that close to it, and the view was spectacular! (Btw - these are authorized hiking trails, and the lookout point is paved with seating. We wore regular clothing and shoes with treads, but be sure you're up to it fitness-wise). Most visitors are satisfied with just seeing the sign from any location in the city. But if you have the time, some good hiking shoes and companions who are up to the walk, this is a little-known gem for tourists!",
50,A nice walk with plenty of view's,I I did a nice walk with my partner to the Hollywood sign the back of it and I was able to get some cool photos panoramic view of the front this place is quite special to us as we had our engagement here. Bring yourself a little nap sack with plenty of water and some snacks and after your nice long hike located near the parking lot is a little picnic area you should try this enjoy.,
50,Go during the DAY!!,"You can see it but you wont have any pics if you go during the night or low light. Best during day. You can't go climb it either like on movies (thumbs down for that). Its a pretty far distance- Iphones will take a good pic from the assigned site, if you were wondering. Its a tourist must go, you ""ain't been to LA"" if you dont go to sight see the sign.",
30,Do the plantetarium show...must do,Great place to see the hollywood sign..the museum is very well done..the Planetarium show is a must well worth the money,
50,LOVELY VIEW!!,I took some shots of the sign up Mulholland Drive. Excellent Views of the whole city. Beautiful houses and landscape. Worth the short steps up to a viewing point.,
50,Awseome,"A must do. The Hollywood Hills are an interesting drive and the view of the city is wonderful. Highlight of the trip, truly iconic",
50,Nice hike,"there is a trail where you can hike to the sign, it is a great and easy trail, it takes time, but the views and exercise are worth it.",
50,A must see on a visit to Los Angeles,"The Hollywood sign is an iconic structure you can see from all over the city. i know a spot with a great view of the sign as well as Hollywood and the rest of the city. In the Cahuenga Pass take Mulholland Drive west. you'll see a small park on your left (it closes at sunset). From this park you can view the sign, the Hollywood Bowl as well pwerful views of the L.A. Basin. Depending on the time of year and air quality your view may differ!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/915kellyo

30,What's the Deal with the Hollywood Sign,"Iconic, yes, but is it a tourist stop? The simple answer is not really. The Hollywood sign was originally built as Hollywoodland after a commercial developer started building in the Hollywood Hills. Shortened and refurbished recently the sign can be viewed from all over Hollywood and LA's Westside. And that is the point: view it from afar to see its strength, grace and defining beauty. When you try to get close to sign you will find yourself bewildered by tiny Hill roads with little directions or road signs present. On you find your way there, it is inevitably a let down up close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forflash

Create some time to enjoy a day of hiking or horseback riding up there. I've done this several times since moving to la in 2010. Every time friends or family came in from out of town and were able to walk that far (it isn't ADA - friendly or paved for the most part). You MUST bring plenty of water. If you bring a pet you must bring plenty of water for the pet as well. Bring poop bags to clean up after your animal, hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, and sturdy shoes. The view from the top is worth the bragging rights....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132williamb

40,This review is coming from an Angeleno!!,"If you are visiting LA, I'm pretty sure the Hollywood sign is on your places to visit list.Let's set the proper expectations about this site. There is nothing special about the sign itself but what to means to the people of LA and the history behind. However, I would definitely consider to visit it if coming from other city/country but as part of half a day hiking at Griffith Park where you could enjoy of a nice hike, take advantage of awesome views of surrounding neighborhoods as well as the Hollywood sign itself.There are numerous hiking trails in the park, some of them leading to the sign. By doing this, you will kill two birds at once: hiking at Griffith + visit to the observatory & take awesome pictures of the city including the sign.Try to go towards the end of the day or early in the morning when it is not foggy.Take a bottle of water and sunscreen with you.Allow at least 2 hours for this activity.Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1899IMfrankg

40,The Drive is As Interesting As The Sign,"It's just a sign but when visiting Los Angeles it is the iconic thing to see. When we visited 22 years ago my wife was driving and missed it. Not this time. I guess there are plenty of places to glimpse the sign and you can even hike to it. Fewer places to actually get out and have a look. With a little research we planned out a good route taking Mulholland Drive. No tour needed and enjoyed several lookout points along the way. It was an interesting, scenic and unrushed drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTHolt

40,Worth a stop,"It's a cliche, but a photo in front of the Hollywood Sign is on par with that obnoxious picture of you holding up the Leaning Tower of Pisa or holding up the Statue of Liberty by the torch.There are quite a few spots to get a pic in front of it, but the best tour companies in town will know of the quieter, closer spots.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cwbush83
50,Awesome,"Only thanks to a terrific tour guide would I have found out about the best view of the Hollywood sign...Lake Hollywood!!! Got some amazing pictures of the sign and of L.A. From here! Sign is not as large and prominent in person as you would think. You actually can't see it from everywhere in Hollywood or Beverly Hills like I expected. Nonetheless, once I found this great spot to get close to the sign, it was priceless! Far better then the walk of fame!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slp11379
40,Cool to see but limited access,"We have a few areas we have found over the years to get a better view of the sign. You're allowed to hike Mount Lee and get behind the sign but you have to walk around to get there. About 45 minute walk. If you want a good view without hiking it, I suggest going on google earth and checking out what streets provide the best view points for your personal preference. They are all residential streets so limited parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bits58
50,Worth seeing,"Well, it is what it is...we went on a tour to see the sign from Mulholland Drive -reasonably close- and of course you can see it from lots of other places in Hollywood.No need to take a tour really as you dont get that close!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeLinda23
40,Go with a local guide for best view - it's an iconic photo,One of the most recognised landmarks in the world. This is an unmissable part of your LA trip.Have been several times and found it better (and easier) if going with a local guide as it can be quite tricky to navigate the roads around it and they will know the best places for pictures..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonHornbuckle
50,Afternoon Trail,Such a beautiful place to go on a trail. We made our way up past the ranch until we were only a few hundred metres under he sign. The trails are beautiful and very easy (not always sign posted so either take a chance or make sure you know where you are going. Saying that though we saw lots of people on the trail so you can always just ask. We had a wonderful fairly easy walk and really enjoyed the sign. We did see a snake but it was harmless and didn't even know we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh_soph
20,California visit.,We tried to drive to the top but we're not able to. I pointed to a spot on google maps and was given directions but the street signs said that only residents could drive down them. I talked to some natives later and the sign is not accessible by car but has to be walked to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VerbBatonRouge
50,The iconic board of LA,"I visited this place during my Oneday in LA tour. It looks great from Griffith Park. Hollywood sign is 93 years old (1923). Even though it turned to be an icon, originally it was created to advertise real estate, it was ""HOLLYWOODLAND"" displayed by Developers S. H. Woodruff and Tracy E. Shoults began. Thomas Fisk Goff, the artist who created the Hollywood sign, was born in London in 1890.Hollywood sign was not attended after the sale of the land till 1949. The Chamber of Commerce auctioned each of the nine letters for $28,000 to raise the needed renovation money and it is back with Pride from 1973",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Easwarin
40,Iconic,"When visiting LA you just have to go see this, but bear in mind you cannot get anywhere near it. It is fully protected and guarded 24 hours a day.There is a particular spot to view it from the lower housing estate area where you can take a photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveo334
30,It's a Sign on the Side of a Hill,"This is the famous iconic ""Hollywood"" sign that can be seen from many locations. Don't seek it out but if you see it, take a picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yellowpixels
50,Photo Op Stop..,"You have to do your homework and have a great deal of respect of the local community get your ideal shot. The local are not thrilled with the ""tourists"", remember they bought the property their house is on they do not own the street, sidewalks or public parking. They come to our towns and walk our our sidewalks and park on our streets. Just be respectful and obey the laws.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billindax2
40,The nicest is the view,The sign itself is nothing but a good excuse to climb the hills of Hollywood and enjoy the incredible view of LA and surroundings.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woreditor
30,It is what it is,"Really, NBD. It's a bunch of letters that spells out Hollywood. Nothing more than that.There are parks nearby that will allow you to get a picture with the ""sign"" over your shoulder. Frankly, we enjoyed a stroll in the park much more.There are many great things to see in LA; the HOLLYWOOD sign isn't one of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KenfromNY
30,Hiking lovers! Here you go,"Be ready to hike for about 90 minutes with high steep hikes.. Wear sneakers, bun your hair girls, put on your shorts and go ahead.Hiking is nice.Here is the surprise near the end you will have two ways, one to see the front of the sign, another one for the back of the signGuess what? You won't even be that close to the sign. You will be a little close of course.. But of course you will be far too.Don't ever be tricked that you will be just beneath the sign, sorry not true.The hike is nice.. Closer to sign so you can have nicer pictures.That's it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnhanna62
50,Icon of Hollywood,"If you miss the Hollywood sign, it is your own fault. It can be seen from many locations in the area. Take as many pictures as you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenW590
30,Sign,Well it's just a sign on the top of a hill although the history of it is quite interesting.Can be seen throughout the area and yes it is renowned for its appearance in Holywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/628philb
50,Pretty cool,We went to see the Hollywood sign as we have been seeing this on television our entire lives. It was pretty much as expected. We found a great place to get a good look at it and take some pictures. I'm glad I made it there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H1496FFtimh
30,Trails not labeled well.,"I went on the family friendly hike (mount Hollywood hiking trail-Charlie Turner Trailhead). This trail crosses paths with other trails and it is not always clear which direction you need to go to see the Hollywood sign. The day I went was rainy so there were not many people on the trails. I had to download a Hiking app on my phone just to make sure I was still headed in the right direction. Unfortunately as my hike went on in the rain, it became too hazy to see the sign. I will not attempt this hike again but will opt for a drive by instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/348kelleyy
40,The moust popular Sign,"If you come to this town that does not laugh to miss, it really is glorious to be in this place, too bad they can not be approached closer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dacey2016
30,Should be able to get closer,"We went on a Route 66 Road Trip and this was on our list of must sees. To our dismay, we were not allowed to get close to the sign. We tried several different routes to get a little closer but were constantly detoured by signs that said no access to Hollywood Sign. We ended up going up to Griffith Observatory, but could only view from a far distance. We understand that this is a highly protected landmark, but maybe Hollywood could allow closer visits by paying for a ticket and that cost could go to security so that boneheads don't vandalize the area. Just my thoughts...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandaandkirk
40,Come see this Landmark,While in Los Angeles take time to Drive up the hill side as close as you can get toGet a closer look at the Hollywood Sign. It has been there for years I first seen itIn 1984 and 32 years it is still looking great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/54dougm
10,Sad,"You can not take a tour or walk up to the sign. This is due to vandalism that people have done over the year, which I can understand. I was really looking forward to go in the hills and seeing the sign, but I seen it from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mz2nd2none
50,What an iconic landmark,Worth the drive up into the Hollywood Hills to get a close look at this amazing historic landmark. You will also enjoy the drive up the narrow streets to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y5069FQthomasl
50,A picture which is a must....,"Well, no normal person in the world has not heared of it. You can not say you have been to Hollywood without taking a photo with this famous sign. Very nice and mitholigical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267daniele
40,A site,It shows from many different places but it was hard to get a picture with it since it's quite far (a selfie with the sign is hard...pictures of the sign are fine),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillz990
50,A must see local nostalgic sign,Almost everywhere you go in LA you can see the sign or take a icture with it. One great place to see the sign is the shopping square by Chinese theater. We were on second level.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rhondabaseballtexas
50,Feel like a movie star :D,"Typical symbol from great movies... I had the chance to visit a keep a photo as great memory!!! the best we can have in life is a great memory, from a great place :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perr0tinha
40,What can you say about a sign!,"Yeah, it's an icon, and yes you can see it from a long distance. And we know the history, that it used to say Hollywoodland. But it's still a sign and there isn't much you can do about it except look at it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordanS8
50,Go to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive,Drove up to get close to the sign. We were taking some curvy roads and saw some pretty cool houses. There was parking and other people to take our photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B9120UDashleya
20,No that amazing,"The roads are very difficult and there is no sufficient signs in the trail. Impossible to get there by public transportation, which means you have to spent some money in a car.",
30,Smaller than expected,"We tried a number of locations to view the sign. We felt the Observatory was the best for unobstructed views. The sign doesn't at all seem as big as it does on television, you have to zoom in quite a bit and taking selfies it doesn't really appear. The drive up to the observatory is very nice as is the view over the city.",
30,It is just a sign,Not worth a visit but if you are passing by it may be worth turning your head in the required direction to view the sign.,
40,SIght to see,"What a sight, the views of LA are amazing and the sign is a classic California monument. Great for photography",
50,Got to be done,Either trek across the lovely path from The Griffith Park Observatory car park (it's free) or head to Tahoe Drive where you can park up on the side of the road on a section away from the houses for a good photo opportunity. The locals aren't overly welcoming if you drive further up into the hills where the roads get very narrow and who can blame them?,
30,For hardcore fans only...,"We climbed up Mount Lee to see the sign from its top. Very disappointed to see there is nothing really done to facilitate a nice picture. The fence is very high, and I'm lucky to be 6'6 (198cm), otherwise that would have been very disappointing. The walk itself is nice, but there are nicer spots in the Santa Monica mountains nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arnaud1972
40,Pretty Cool to See,"Did not actually hike up to the sign, but we scoped it out from the Griffith Observatory, as well as from various spots in our sightseeing. From the Observatory, I was surprised at how small the sign seemed. However, it was very easy to spot, and read, from wherever we could see it in our travels. Pretty sweet to have finally laid eyes on one of the iconic sights in the U.S.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyleA2402
30,One of those 'must see' places,"LA is not the easiest city to find your way around but I was surprised how difficult it was to drive to this tourist point, given its iconic status. Not easy to park to take photos either. Really Hollywood? Think this one through and make it more accessible!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chasyj
40,Fun to visit,"We hired a car at lax to see the sights. Hollywood sign was one of them, it's not simple to get a good vantage point. You can't just drive straight there as its on the side of a Mountain. We researched the best roads to view from first before going. There's no one right way to see the sign or get to it, we just used google to work out the best way to drive for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeTrippinAU
30,Hard to get there,"It's not a easy place to go, but you have a great views. There's nothing special on the sign but you have to take a pictures there when been in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lottermanndiego
40,You cannot get too close,Find a spot nearby with google maps and head to. Closer to the sign police will restrict access only to neighbors but will guide to a nearby parking where photos are possible. Otherwise is funny...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aburel
30,Get in and out fast!,"If you're travelling on your own, you better be quick! You drive up the hill through residential areas, where you feel quite conspicuous and watched from every angle. You aren't allowed to park and get out, once you get up close to the sign. We did and the authorities were right there. Apparently visitors are not wanted. The view is better down the hill anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mullendoktor
30,Iconic piece to Hollywood past,Drive by and take some pictures or take a hike to get closer. This sigh is really famous and can be seen from near by cities as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidaE7048SV
50,Viewing from Canyon Lake Drive,We spent a fair amount of time chasing the hollywood sign. We eventually stumbled across a dog park which had spectacular unobstructed views of the sign. this on on Canyon Lake Drive. We did see it from a number of other locations but this was the spot. A walk to the top of the hill along the road leads to a flat dirt patch with a rock in the middle where you can stand and get some good selfie snaps of the Hollywood sign.Once you have taken your photos thats about it. I wouldn't recommend a tour if you have a hire car which is much cheaper.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benbencor
40,View from the Kodak bridge,"Very small and in the distance, but worth having a look at if you are in LA. Seen it a few times and seeing it from Hollywood Blvd is as good as it gets without going to too much effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/989kevinl
40,The all time iconic sign,Eventually found a route to see the sign. Hollywood sign into TomTom sat nav and it took us on a route along North Beechwood drive and then uphill until we came to a junction where road was closed and a very kind security person advised us to park in a place opposit him - there were only room for about 4 vehicles so we were luckyHe then suggested a route where we got some great picturesWe even saw people up on the hill above the Hollywood letters - how they did that I do not know - looked scaryWorth doing if it is on the list of place to visit - and it costs nothing,
30,Cool but not much activity,I had visit this place as a part of tour program. It was interesting to see it so close and hear the history. I did couple pictures with sign on my hand and on my head. What else you can do with sign? Still cool. Remember you cannot smoke there. Good luck!,
30,It's a sign,We had a great view of the sign from Griffith Observatory but taking a photo from there wasn't very successful. We also had a great view of the sign from Hollywood Blvd and slightly better photos opportunities. Unfortunately for me it is a sign and not much more than that.,
30,The iconic Hollywood sign - not quite so impressive as in the movies!,"We could only get part of the way to see the sign, and although at the time we did a bit of oohing and aaahing, it wasn't quite as impressive as in the movies. Sorry Hollywood peeps! But I still love looking at it in the movies :)",
40,Iconic,You can see this from various places around the city but the view from the Griffith observatory is probably one of the best. It can get very crowded though.,
50,FREE and fabulous,Love the free parking. Great workout uphill for an hour. Good view of theSign at the end of the low road or take the high road to be above it. We enjoyed a bit of banter with fellow walkers and were amused at a couple who asked what was at the end of the walk (must have been sheep in a past life üòÄ). We did the walk to the lower point in under 2 hours but allow 2.5 if you like to take your time or want to take the high road. Fantastic view of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kitmeister
40,Hike it up!,"You can see Hollywood sign from many-many points in LA, specifically in Hollywood itself, it kind of follows you everywhere you go. My favorite view of it is from Griffith Observatory, closely followed by the hike to the Hollywood sign (which is not difficult, but will take up about two hours to get up there and back).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alina_Austin
40,Harder than it looks,"Took an Uber cab as far as the law would allow, then walked a bit more. There was a bend in the road with a nice spot to take pictures. The rest of the way up seemed more daunting, so went back down. It was a 30 minute walk off the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiawroane
30,Icon of the area,"One sort of can't miss this icon of the area - looming on the hill. There were many vantage points to get a view of the sign, I recommend Hollywood & Highline, or Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ice_D_8
10,If you find it I will give you a star.,"The Hollywood sign cannot be seen anywhere. A good part of your day is spent searching for it. We asked local people how to find it they didn't know themselves. We thought we could see this sign as we hit Los Angeles. It's not like in the movies it's almost impossible to find. You can see it from a distance sometimes, and when you do it's only for a split second and it's tiny. Not believe me, zoom into my picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butterflytravellor
20,hhmmm,"We have seen this a number of times now. The first time, I was so disappointed. I expected bigger and better and did not get the WOW factor at all. So we have been back a couple of times just to see if I missed something. Nope we just don't get the hype about it. It's just a white sign with a not so pretty dry hill behind it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariofionag
20,To far away,"We took the hop on hop off bus tour. The viewing location they took us to was so far away, we could barely see the sign. Trying to get a good picture was a waste of time. We would have been better off to have driven our car to a better location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelJunky1962
40,Can't get up close and personal.,We drove as far up to the sign as possible but no place to park and take photos. The park rangers are very strict and will not even allow a car to sit for a minute. Everyone visiting Los Angeles/Hollywood must see this sign. Several people park down the hill and hike up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunny0016
30,Cool view,I liked the architecture of the homes surrounding the area more than I liked seeing the sign.But I'll admit it is a very relaxing and peaceful spot to hike and visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GyasiLateef
50,A must see!,On view a lot as you drive around Hollywood but well worth driving up into the hills to get as close as you can to the famous sign !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayC599
30,too smaller !!!!!!!!,"The place where the sign is located it is so beautiful, calm and fancy! however I though to find a huge, impressive and illuminated sign... I found NONE at all :(...",
50,Fantastic view and exercise,"Was in LA for work and had a weekend there. First time in LA so had to do the touristy thing of trekking to the famous sign. We aimed to see sunset and thought it would make a nice backdrop for photos. It took us about 2.5 hours to reach the top. The end was quite difficult but as soon as we reached the top and saw the sign, it was all worth it!The view down at the city was spectacular, especially at night. You're in the middle of a hill with no artificial light and looking down at a lit up city...When we finished taking pictures we headed down in the dark, which was a little scary with animals (mainly birds) making noises. We also saw a sign on the way up saying 'beware of snakes'....But it was a really good day out, follows nicely after Hollywood boulevard and followed by some well deserved food at universal studios.",
50,üëçüèº,"Everyone wants a picture by the Hollywood Sign! I walked all the way up behind the sign which is an awesome view. Worth the steep walk up. It's a paved road though so strollers & wheelchairs are good to go. Also, I managed to get pretty close to the front of the sign too. As close as legally possible anyway. I walked there through Griffith Park which was long but there are quicker ways. Just google 'how to get close to the Hollywood Sign' & all the info will pop up.",
40,View from Cabo Wabo Restaurant,View is good from the eating area above the Chinese Theatre. Go up the escalators and the view from the top floor is great.,
50,Got to appreciate the iconic sign,It's a great drive there seeing some retro houses along the way. Put 3400 canyon lake drive in your GPS. You get to see the reservoir and lake on one side and the sign on the other (plus a heap of celebrity houses and pools).,
40,An Icon,"Another one of those things that you just have to see when you come to LA. We first saw the sign from the Griffin Observatory as we read this was one of the best views but I was disappointed so we went on the Wonderview Trail via the Wisdom Tree (amazing views of LA) which leads right to the back of the sign, then we went down a different route which led to pretty stunning views close to the front of the view. I would highly recommend this trail if you're not too scared of heights (I am, it was pretty hairy...) and are fit enough (it's about 2 miles each way).The let down is how little information there is on how to get a good view of the sign, there are no signposts and not much official information online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swannifer
30,It's iconic and a must see but other than that it's nothing fancy.,Like the title says it's iconic and a must see.. other than that nothing special about it really.. it's a long walk for little ones,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azbullrider
50,Vote,It was fun hiking up to the sigh! I give it a 5 bc it is so big! and kool. It's a great place to see!! It make u feel good for some reason! IK this reason is so terrible but what the heck ever!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/codyp724
40,Big Hollywood letters!,"My family and I took one of those California tour.As we get around the city, sunset boulevard, Beverly Hills, our tour guide let us stop on the top if the hill and had a really good view. Its pretty awesome having to see it on my own eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WOW_mom93
50,The shot of a life time,"To all the travelers that are coming to Los Angeles one of the most sought out Landmark is the Hollywood Sign.I can remember when I was a kid and saw the sign battered and unattended to, it was a shame that Hollywood would have let it go for so many years.Until 1978 a group of prominent people in Hollywood got together and did something about it. Know for all of you out there that are looking for a great shot, the best place is the complex at Hollywood and Highland. Climb to the Observation deck they call it ""The Grand Portal Bridge"",and take your shot of a life time! Note if you try to take a shot in the neighboring streets, 1st its dangerous because someone may hit you with a car and 2nd the neighborhoods are trying to keep tourist from hanging out in the middle of the streets ""making a commotion"" So take my advice and spend $2 dollars for parking and make a day of it. You also have Madame Tussaud's,The TCC Chinese Theater (Formerly Grauman's),Hollywood Walk of Fame is there as well. make a ck list and Get yourself out here. Make a big smile, take a picture and Enjoy the time you spend here... :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelagY776MX
30,A little disappointing!,Unfortunately we thought you could get up close and personal on one of those sightseeing buses but no. The only way to get close is to hike up to the sign but even then I'm not sure how close you can get. We ended taking our photos from the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Centre observation bridge. The sign is no longer lit up at night either so that was a little disappointing as well as we were hoping to view it from our hotel in the evening. At the end of the day it was still great to be able to say we had been to Hollywood and seen the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20grace13
50,Hike to Hollywood,Included in the stay at the Hollywood Hostel was the activity of going to the Hollywood sign. The hike to the sign was truly a good workout. I did not continue the hike to get above the sign. The only expense for the hike was a round trip bus fare for $1.00.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750terrencec
20,Hollywood sign,"Disappointed.It is not worth to expend time looking for it.On top of that there is no night illumination.If you have the chance to to see it from the shopping area, fine, but do not look for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgardop401
40,Worth the hike,"We hiked up to see the Hollywood sign (or as close as we could get) and it was worth it. The hike is pretty easy, and like many of the locals, you could run to the top.I would recommend coming in the early morning, 7am, as the air is still brisk and there are wonderful views of the city (with no smog).There are a few trails that diverge from the main one, so the only thing I was surprised not to see was some type of trail head. I didn't know if we should stop or keep going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattbX68QA
50,1 USD for the tour !,"Unbeatabe ! from my hostel in walk of fame i walked down the street , i got into one bus for few minutes than had around 35mn hike , so i could get a nice & direct view of the Hollywood sign , walked down , take the bus and kept on walking , total for 1 usd , you really can have fun for not much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/algerianm2014
40,Hollywood!!!,The iconic sign which people have seen numerous times. Its fun to go around and have photos clicked with it in the background. Nice way to remember ones trip to LA :D,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhatPavan
30,Good for a picture,"I was kind of disappointed by the sign. I figured you would be able to get a lot closer to it. Which you can, if you hike to it. Really wasn't an option with a four year old and so much to see in a little time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trojan29
40,A Famous Griffith Park Attraction You've Got To See!,Something you've got to see when you come to L.A. I see it every day living in Hollywood. You can hike up to it! Winter/spring is the best time for it. Summer is too hot for a hike like this. It's up hill all the way! But that fond memory of hiking up that hill as a kid is what comes back to me when I look up and see it! You will have fond memories of it too when you look back at the photos and selfys!!! Take the LADOT Shuttle to the park or drive up and park at the bottom of the hill in the park. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw353
50,Return to Hollywood,"We visited LA again, this time we hiked up to the back of the Hollywood sign. I drove to the same location I did in 2014 (3350 Deronda Drive). Deronda Drive is the best & closest you will to the sign. To get to the back, take the paved roadway all the way to the top. Unlike the other directions there is no dirt nor poop on this trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassm73
50,Hollywood Sign,"The fact that we were able to see if from far away was still good, but we decided to look for a closer view and went up to the Griffith Observatory which was pretty Awesome. Not just dis we see the Hollywood Sign but we also saw an amazing view of the city!. Beautiful!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marelisr2015
30,Iconic,"Yep, it's a sign. You've seen it a million times on tv, in magazines, etc. But you'll take a picture of it anyway because it's so iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/writrsblck
50,Hope For A clear Day,Seeing the sign is great but when with someone who knows the history behind the sign makes it much more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teetermom
40,"Free, easy to find, and worth the effort to get up close.","The HOLLYWOOD sign is iconic, period. It's recognized worldwide and is one of the areas true landmarks. The effort to hike or bike to it as several people have mentioned is, in my opinion, not worth it. There's nothing to do, per se, except take pictures of it or selfies with in behind you - yet I love doing just that! For me, the best and most preferred way to view the sign (which I've done countless times given all the friends and family I've entertained as visitors) is from atop Canyon Lake Drive. Set your GPS to the 3200 block of Canyon Lake Drive then follow it to the top of the incline where there are two excellent viewing areas, the first for the HOLLYWOOD sign and the one on the other side of the road for viewing Lake Hollywood and Hollywood Reservoir (most people don't know about either) as well as several homes of stars and celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
50,great icon,First saw this sign more than 4 decades ago. It is still awesome to behold. Brought my children and grandchild to see it. love it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahfrazier
50,Iconic.. Make the Hike,"What don't you know about this iconic sign?! We made the hike to the top. Took about 45 minutes to the top. It's a trek but worth every step. LAPD guard it at all times. Once to the top, you'll get some amazing views, pictures and videos!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYLivinLAdreamin
50,The hike to the top is AMAZING!,Picked up a friend at LAX and we decided to hike up to and above the HOLLYWOOD sign. Great workout. Lots of places to stop for photos. Take water and plan on 3 Miles up and 3 miles down.The views can't be beat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoSeeDoTravelDuo
50,Highlight For me,For a long time I have always wanted to visit Hollywood and I'm glad I finally did it. The views from Griffith Observatory was okay,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zouklas
50,Hollywood must,I was on a tour with a family of five. I would say this is a must see. It takes little or no time to take a quick pic and see the LA bowl.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630andid
30,Good for a quick look.,The Hollywood sign can be viewed from many places in Hollywood. One of them is the Hollywood Blvd shopping complex where you can get to level four and take a nice picture with you in it. I have not gone right up to the sign and wouldn't know how to. But from viewing it from all over the city... id say its a bit over ratted. Get a quick snap of it and youll be ready to forget about it. There are many better things to do in Hollywood than look at a sign!Enjoy none the less.Happy travels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simage82
40,More than just a sign,We went up to the sign at dusk and not only were there less crowds but amazing views down to LA. Worth the winding trip up!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rjoc

30,Big Sign - that's about it!,"You can see the Hollywood Sign from the freeway. It is between Universal Studio/City Walk and the Hollywood Bowl. The sign is huge, and looks just like the photo.

20,Located on a steep winding mountain,"Make sure you are rested with lots of energy before you treck up this big mountain.

30,Just ok,"The view is very beautiful, but after all, it's just a sign, and you have to drive through narrow streets just for taking a picture with a sign that is far away. I don't recommend going to there if you have anything else to do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Assaffri
20,Bad,You really cannot get close to the sign. I could only get a far distant from it and to far to really see it good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/723sigridw
30,Great views day or night....,The views are spectacular from here day or night. The drive to the top goes through a few miles of winding and I mean winding roads. The roads are very very narrow and you have to be very careful as the roads can only have two cars at a time and one side has cars parked because of the people that live there. Also when driving at night you have watch out for the coyotes. The sign is not that big as they make it look and you can't get up close and touch the sign unless you do it illegally. I would recommend just for the view if anything else. I wouldn't recommend for the kids though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/masonalpha9603

30,Is what it is.,"The hollywood sign is just that a sign, we went on a star tour to see it and you can't get close to the sign at all. Would be nice if you could get closer but you can't due to its location. But worth a look while you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allypop890

30,Just an iconic sign,"This is literally a sign. It's iconic. It's worth seeing it, BUT, it's just a sign. Go in the daytime as they don't light it up at night anymore, which is a real shame. Our photos didn't come out because of this, but at least I've seen in. It's a drive out so be prepared to put the time in. Hollywood is pretty spread out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4rcus2001

50,Iconic,There are two places to best view the sign. One is on Beachwood Canyon which has horrible parking but you can get a straight on shot of the Iconic sign built and erected in 1923. It originally said Hollywoodland. It is not lit at night so make sure you get your pictures during the day. I think the best shot is at Lake Hollywood Overlook. There is usually parking and also a dog park if you have your pooch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melobeam
50,Great hike!,"It was a great hike and beautiful view! I've been there twice, first time I didn't see anything because of the foggy weather but the second time was awesome!

50,Just like in the movies,"We were at the observatory on the hill and saw the Hollywood sign from here. The observatory is where they did a knife scene in Rebel Without A Cause staring James Dean and Natalie Wood. They have a bronze bust of James Dean up there with a sign on it telling you about the movie. There are restrooms on the grounds, and you can see East and West Los Angeles from there, and of course all the smoug. Beautiful grounds and scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O5877QWrobertas
50,Still one of the loveliest hikes you can do with visitors,"We like this hike for visitors who are reasonably fit, for the views - both driving up from Franklin along N. Beachwood, but all the way up the winding trails. No-one we've walked it with has been disappointed with the trail, especially from behind the sign. If warm, remember to take water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
40,Iconic Sign,You will be able to see the sign from several vantage points in the Hollywood area. Go to the back of the mall next to TCL Theaters and you can get a great shot. Also can get a different angle from Griffith Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Texhusky75

30,Iconic. wonky.,Sure it's iconic. It is a little underwhelming though. It's not even straight. Would recommend just heading to the Griffith park observatory and seeing both.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jambri01
50,Had always wanted to see...,"The wife and I had always wanted to see the Hollywood sign in person. Always see it on TV and movies and said one day a trip to California would be needed.

50,Cool view and tick off the list,Try not to do in the heat and also take water. if you follow these to things you will love it.

30,It's a sign!!!,"Saw the sign from Hollywood boulevard. It's a sign, this is like;y to be my 200th review so thought it would be funny to review something as pointless as this. I suppose it's a must see if you are here but you look at it, photograph yourself in front of it and then forget it's there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mikesalter
30,Hard to see,This attraction is hard to see. Very tiny from downtown and it's illegal to get close. Best view we had was from highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenimler

30,"Yes it's ""just a sign"" but a good one","A must if you're visiting Hollywood of course. I walked through the Hollywoodland subdivision to get below it and was able to check out the beautiful houses from the 1923s when Hollywoodland was built. I originally planned to get behind it but second guessed my direction and didn't want to get lost late in the afternoon so I went with directions from my hostel and did not get to the trail which ends behind it. There is a ""scenic route"" for cars which I suggest visiting while you're up there! Great view of the city.No there is nothing amazing and fancy about the sign because it is just that. But we must admit we all want to see it no matter how cliche it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/877alic
40,Hard to rate,"This is difficult to rate. We drove to the observatory and took a picture with the sign in the background. We could not get close from this location. It is a very cool thing to do while in Hollywood, but I had the impression that we could get closer- you can't unless you hike, and even then I believe it is protected so you can't get very close. It is still a must-see. You can see it when you are driving in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASLOV
50,Nice view!,I couldn't get closer to the sign besides viewing it from the Griffith Observatory and hiking a mountain closer. But its a must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/przgrl13

40,An Icon,"The HOLLYWOOD sign is letting you know that you have arrived. I think it is the iconic symbol for California.

40,Cool but not accessable to...,"Climb on.as you can imagine, it's protected and gated.

40,Awesome Landmark,"It's an awesome landmark. You can see it from the Griffith Observatory; Hollywood Lowes. Tried to find a closer site to get a look at the sign, but it always took us back to Griffith park. When hubby looked it up, it seems that you can't get any closer to the sign. So we moved on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarissaDW
50,It just has to be done,"Viewed from many locations (we had our first spot from the Hollywood and Highland), there is a great viewpoint from the Griffith Observatory and from above the Hollywood Bowl. Take one of the bus tours. We weren't going to, but we had a quiet morning and we were totally surprised by how much fun we had. Next time we might take a horse ride under the sign (yes, we're going back this May 2016) :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lissy2904
20,NO.,"It is the lamest thing I have ever done during my trip. Long ride and not worth it at all.I was excited to go see the Hollywood sign and thought it would be a big deal. But you only see it from far away and take very far and meaningless pictures - unless you like showing off that youve been in LA:)!I know my recommendation might not affect alot because lots of people love seeing it and i was one of them, but seriously if it doesn't mean that much to you just don't waste your time and take advantage of that precious time to visit other places in breathtaking LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christellepyammine

30,This experience is only rated average because it is exactly what you would expect-beautiful!,"This is really just a viewing spot, once you see it and get your pictures it is over. It is definitely worth it, and the view down the hills from the sign is lovely too. Do it! but don't expect it to be anything other than a photo op.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephanielK5633LG

40,Hollywood Sign,How can one not take a look at the sign when in Hollywood. Not sure of the name of the shopping centre but everyone came to take photos here. If you find Dolby Theatre you will find the shopping centre. Worth a visit and it is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runcation4fun
40,Iconic. Don't miss this in your photo ops,We took a picture of the sign from the Griffith Observatory which was quite far but we didn't want to venture out too close to the sign as we heard the drive might be horrendous because so many cars are jostling for a good spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Draxxzo
50,Hike to Iconic Hollywood Sign,"If you are a tourist and have the time, it is fun to hike to the Hollywood Sign. If you live in the LA area and haven't made the hike, then consider adding this to your to-do list. It's a fairly easy walk on paved roads. Along the way there are several good photo opportunities with the sign in the background. The hike is longer starting from the Griffith Park Observatory. We parked in the hollywood hills neighborhood and started from there. We went on a week day in the winter on a partly cloudy day so it wasn't hot at all but we didn't have the greatest visibility for views of the city. At the top, you actually can't see that much of the sign as it is fenced off. However, we stopped there and ate our packed lunch. There isn't much sitting space; just a few logs. It was fun anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A9153JDmargaretc

30,"It was nice to see, But wish I could get closer","I went on a hollywood Access tour which brought us pretty high up to this peek lookout point and we were able to see it, however, the picture that we took weren't the best.

40,Classic tour spot,"Every year, I get to take a group of Chinese students here so they can get their pictures and prove that they have made it to Hollywood! It's so fun to take people to this location for the first time and see their excitement as they take pictures in front of this famous sign! At this spot all you can really do is take pictures but right above it is the Griffith Observatory and below it is a park with picnic benches! So thankfully there are other things to do nearby! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BMHSarah
40,A must see! But why isn't it lit at night?,"Not much more anyone can write about this icon. Get goosebumps looking at it from many directions. But I just didn't understand why it's not lit up to show it off at night? On Jimmy Kimmel backdrop it's lit. But in person, it's not. Was told it hasn't been lit in years. Don't know if that's true, but while we were there, the sign was not visible at night. But it's still cool, just because it is what it is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/veratom
50,GREAT VIEW - GREAT PICTURES,"The Hollywood sign is the one think that tourists seem to really want to see. It's perfect for pictures, even a horse back riding opportunity.

I really enjoyed the view, the pictures & the small hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523carmenr
30,Samller then I thought,I was happy to see this sign. but I have to say that I thought that it was going to be bigger. I guess it was because I saw it from a distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avalanche08
40,It's exactly what it needs to be.,"Yep - we're reviewing the Hollywood sign. As you might have guessed, it's constructed. It's white. It's also secured to the ground. Did you know it's painted? And it's spelled correctly too? Wow - what a sign. You should go see it. It looks exactly like the pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrueDaddy
40,Needs to be seen,"You can't get up to the sign but there are several points in LA where you can get a great view of it. The mall next to the Walk of Fame, if you go up the escalators to the top floor theres a great view of it from the back. Remember, as iconic as it is, it is just a sign and only needs a quick photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snsimmy23
50,must see,if you are in los angeles hen you should not miss to see the Hollywood Sign. But I must clear one point to all first time goer that you cant go to the point where Hollywood sign is located. There are many places from where you can clearly see the sign and capture the beautiful sign in your camera and memory. Griffith Observatory and Walk of Fame are the best places to see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CocoGoel
30,"A must, but...","It is off cause a must to visit the sign when being in Hollywood, but you can't get near the sign so you have to take it on the distance. Anyhow the tour we made with the travel company in the area was cool - cool driver",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karsten1960

50,Hollywood!!!!!!,"You can't NOT go see the Hollywood sign. The most iconic sign in the world is it not? When you think of LA you think HOLLYWOOD!!! and that sign. We were lucky enough to do a Hollywood stars tour and the driver told us what address to type in to get yourself close enough for great photos. So we did that. And, I was impressed seeing it from Griffiths observatory. Seeing it even closer is mind blowing. Especially when you've seen it on tv and movies and posters forever. Great memory. Maybe a 30 minute drive from Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923melissaf
50,top of the world,Long walk across the beautiful neighborhood with amazing villas. From the top you see literally the whole LA and Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maddpariss
40,Quick Must-see,"Having lived in California for years, we had never actually driven up the mountain to see the sign, so we went for it while visiting family last winter.Basic navigation from google works fine for actually getting to the top of the ridge, but expect traffic. Cars were parked on both sides of the windy road to the top, but we were surprised to find plenty of parking (and WiFi) when we got there. Our vista point was actually at the Observatory, but you're only one ridge line from the actual sign, so you get a perfect view for photo opportunities.You can also choose to hike up one of several trails to the sign itself, hence all the parking on the road leading to the top.If you're visiting Southern California, and travel through Hollywood, there's no reason not to take time for a 15 minute drive to the top and snag some pictures of a true icon of California (If you can get to San Francisco for the Golden Gate, you've snagged to 2 most famous in the state)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ab71884

50,Must see photo opportunity!,We drove around bel ait and Beverly Hills fantasising about which mansion we'd own before seeking out the best view of the sign! We think it has to be from the Griffith observatory ! But the pic below shows it from our hotel room,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danksy_uk
30,Visible from near and far,We had fun looking at The Hollywood Sign from many different areas of Los Angeles. We saw it from Culver City and the Griffith Observatory and closer views from the Hollywood Hills.I wish they would change it back to Hollywoodland. It is just an okay symbol for one of the largest cities in the world.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bombersfly10
30,Can't imagine it's worth the hike...,"You get a really clear view of this by going to Hollywood Highland on the Metro, then taking a right and a left to take your photos from the vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johneK6499BK
50,Iconic Hike,Great views and really nice walk into the Hollywood Hills. Make sure you notice the exact route you took to come up because you could get lost like we did on the way back and end up in a neighborhood where you can't find your car again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janiceo271
40,Pretty cool,Didn't end up doing the hike to the sign because we didn't have enough time. We did go for a walk in the area around north beachwood drive. We were told by our hotel concierge that there are hidden staircases around the area which we managed to find!We got some really good pictures of the Hollywood sign. And the staircases were kinda fun to find!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872jessiez
50,Can Not Leave Hollywood with Seeing the HOLLYWOOD Sign Up Close,My view of the Hollywood Sign was included in a tour of Hollywood homes.

50,We visited LA Last april,"It was fascinating to see the Hollywood sign from so many places we visited during our stay in LA, such an Iconic sign, and its pretty big.

50,Good afternoon for exercising,"Walked the trails leading up to the back side of the Hollywood sign and had a blast. Hike is moderate, and the weather was great. Once you get to the top of the hill, you find yourself behind the Hollywood sign w/ breathtaking views of downtown LA and the Pacific ocean. A nice afternoon adventure to get you away form the rat race that is LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daddymole414
40,A Famous Hollywood Icon,"I can't imagine anyone visiting LA without wanting to see the famous Hollywood sign. The thing is that you don't have to do anything special to see it because it can be seen from lots of places. I think the best view of the sign is from Griffith Observatory but that may not be in your plans. You can hike up the mountain to get a pretty close view of the sign but there's no way to drive any closer than the main streets of Hollywood. The streets that would take you closer to the sign by car are generally closed to the public. Unless you want to hike from Griffith Park, don't waste time and effort trying to get a close-up view of this iconic sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmloyd4855
30,"Not all that impressive, but it's ""Hollywood"" after all","We had to work hard to get to a point where we could adequately view the sign. It's a sign. There are so many other things worth seeing that you shouldn't make this a priority for your visit, especially if you are on a schedule. The sign is not illuminated at night, so you have to see it during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulaM8871ZO
50,A Bucket list Experience!,"My husband and I hiked to the top of the Hollywood sign and it truly was breathtaking! Everyone should have this on their bucket list! You can see all of LA from snow in the mountains just beyond Pasadena to the ocean at Santa Monica.We started from The end of Beechwood dr., which is in a residential area, then you can hike up to just below the Hollywood sign for some great pictures. Then you go back down the path and head up the other side to hike up to behind the sign. This is the best part of the hike...you have to make it to the top! The path leads you around the other side of the mountain and the views are amazing! Then it curves back around to behind the sign, the coolest view for sure! We did this hike 30 mins before sunset, I would suggest at least an hour unless you want to walk back in the dark. Seeing the city lit up was beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/756hollyw
30,A lot smaller than you would imagine,"Obviously if you're visiting Hollywood you must see the sign. Having finally found it from the strip we were amazed at how small it appeared. We went and got lost up in the hills as we tried to drive closer, probably drove places that we shouldn't but hey, saw some awesome houses on the way! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665benh

40,Beautiful View,"Me and my family went to Hollywood during August 2015 and after checking out the Hollywood Walk of Fame we decided on taking a close up photo of the Hollywood sign. As a result, we decided to drive towards the highest peak to get the best view of the sign; once we got there we saw a beautiful view of not just the sign but also by looking down to see all of Hollywood. There is also an observatory which details planetary constellations once you've had your fill of taking pictures of the Hollywood sign in the background of your photographs. This is a must-do activity when your in Hollywood as a tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amritpalh

40,"Hollywood Sign, Iconic but a fair distance walk from main strip","We were staying on Sunset Blvd, only a 5min walk to the Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, Madame Tussauds etc. We then proceeded to walk to a good vantage point to have a family photo.After about 20min, we realised we were not getting any closer. It is quite deceiving how far the sign is from the tourist part of Hollywood.We were leaving the next day to go to the airport so we took advantage of the shuttle and asked if they could take us near the sign for a family photo. The shuttle took us up Beachwood Ave off Franklin Ave. The street is like any other street, full of overpriced houses etc however it was worth it for a family pic in front of one of the World‚Äôs most iconic signs.We tipped the shuttle driver a few extra dollars for talking us there and taking the photo for us. He was obviously used to it but appreciated the gesture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSTAA5

We later discovered we could of driven direct from the highway 101 - a route I would highly recommend.Even though the location wasnt the best, it provided us with acceptable pictures showing the Hollywood sign in the background. Overall I was really happy with the location used.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Atgk
50,Cali visit,My daughter and I did a tour and it was great. The man that drove us did a wonderful job and was very informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweetcynt65
30,Get close up,"The sign from a distance is quite unique and something you need to stop and view. However, it is worth taking a drive along the windy roads and hills to get up close and personal with the sign. This can be done by tour bus, however I would recommend driving it yourself, the homes are also quite spectacular through that area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cruwys-wanderlust
50,"GO, and hike to get there!",Views = amazzzzzing!!Take the Cahuenga Peak Hike. It is a tough one but worth it. A few stops along the way and we were at the Hollywood Sign in an hour I think. It was a gorgeous view and so much better than driving up the hill with the hundreds of other tourists!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfedele85
50,Gotta get that photo of the Hollywood sign,We had a car so drove to Lake Hollywood Park and parked up by the dog park. We were told this would be a cool place to get a photo that is right under the sign.

30,Review,You can just easily do this in your own car and save a lot of money and time. It's nice to see once and take your picture. Nothing really exciting here. Just a picture for Facebook lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/714drews
50,A Must!,"Finally got to see this up close. Not easy to find parking, but my niece jumped out and took some good photos for me. Easier to get to than I thought, but definitely a popular spot. Also close to the Griffith Observatory, which is also why it was so busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lmbtrfly
50,This is another good opportunity for tourists,"Hollywood Sign at Hollywood and Highland .If you have limited transportation then this could be one of your best options outside of a guided tour. Hollywood and Highland is probably already on your itinerary, so while you're there be sure to take plenty of photos of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leonancypurl
40,Beautiful view and nice hike,"Getting there by public transport is possible but a car is recommended. We went by metro, and found that the bus did not run due to it being a bank holiday. We decided to walk -so even before we got there, we felt we had walked enough. Having said that we enjoyed the view of typical American houses, and our American friend could tell us which ones were a trailer and all that stuff which were very American. So the walk was nice. We also passed the Church of Scientology for the famous like Tom Cruise as he apparently does not venture to the big ones on Hollywood Boulevard where believers stand outside welcoming non-believers to their church. The trek itself is a long walk either taking a shorter route but more demanding, or a bit longer route with wider paths. We choose the latter. As we neared the top, you have two choices. You can either go to the left, and see the sign in front, but as a fellow hiker informed us the view is not much better than if you took a photo from the car park -and there are such photo opportunities on your way up. So we decided to turn to the right, and walk all the way to the top. It was quite windy as you got there. I was somewhat disappointed -hence not 5 stars- as I really wanted a photo with the sign and me! When you get to the top the sign is from the back -and you view it through a wired fence. There's a small plateu where you can walk up and take photos and see the sign from above. Yet, again not the greatest photo opportunity as the other hikers get in the way for panorama, and the sign looks small. I tried to persuade my friends to go down to take the other route but we were all tired of walking at this point so they decided against it. This was perhaps good as it soon started to get dark, and thus much more cold and windy. Beautiful walk in the dark. We walked towards the Griffith Observatorie but by then it was pitch dark, and we decided to get an Uber back to civilisation. The walk itself definitely takes a couple of hours to enjoy it, and I would recommend that the trek has been completed before sunset. It is certainly an great day out for the whole family whether it is to see the sign, walking the dog, or getting some fresh air, or hiking or if energetic enough go for a jog. I would certainly go again! Enjoy the fresh air away from the town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitao455
20,Hooray for Hollywood I think?,"If movies are your absolute thing then I think this attraction would be awesome. For me I just wanted to see the landmark that I had heard so much about. For me the only word I have is ""underwhelming"".There are several places you can view this landmark however the best and most interesting I feel is via Runion Canyon. There are patches of steep terrain on this hike however should take average fit people 30mins. Check it out you may get more than me out of the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosst256
50,What's not to like?,"Growing up in California, the Hollywood sign is part of my earliest memories. I remember many years ago when one of the letters was missing for quite awhile. In the early days the sign said ""Hollywoodland,"" but that was before my time. The sign can be seen from so many different vantage points -- I'm sure the creators realized exactly that, and nothing about that has or will change. I have even seen the sign from the air flying in to two different airports! Yup, the Hollywood sign is here to stay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773lindat

30,It was exactly how it looks in pictures!,"Which isn't to say it's not cool to see - it's very cool to see in real life. We actually could see it from the plane coming in to LAX from Sydney, which was unexpected but cool. Anyway, it is just a sign, and if you're anywhere in Hollywood driving around or anything you'll be able to get a glimpse, but there's still something surreal and cool about seeing something that's so famous in real life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409adriennem

50,Well worth the effort,"After coming to L.A. frequently for 6 years, I finally managed to set aside time to do this hike. Although ""hike"" implies trekking through bush, which this isn't. Paved and smooth sort roads make this an easy walk, although there are some decent uphill sections.Park at N Beachwood Drive, and walk from there. Plenty of parking.I run at Runyon Canyon all the time, but the views on this trail easily surpass those.

Reached my destination after what seemed like days and expecting to be bedazzled by the size of the sign. Nowhere to park, but not to be defeated, I decided to drive around the lot to where I could get a view of HOLLYWOOD.

There are easier ways to get up top of you can find your way through the maze of streets through the Hollywood hills. If you do decide to hike bring lots of water and go early if you go in the summer months. There is no shade and you can become dehydrated very easily. There are much more exciting and strenuous hikes around the area if you're looking for more of a hike/workout with less of a crowd and you can still view the sign.However this is worth the visit for the traveler.

However, there was enough people on the trail that can point you in the right direction. I wouldn't recommend this trail for the little ones unless you're prepared to carry them at some point and those that were pushing baby strollers looked absolutely miserable.

40,"A quick and ""must do"" tour","Although tired from the trip, It was still very early when I got home and I didn‚Äôt want to lose the day, than I decided to visit all the ‚ÄúMust Do‚Äôs‚Äù from Los Angeles right on the first day. The first stop was to reach the so famous Hollywood sign up on the hills and take a very touristic first picture here. The best spot I heard about was at the Canyon Lake Drive (address: 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood). Just put the address on the GPS and you will get to a dog park with many parking spots on the street. From there, you can take how many pictures you want from the sign and also have a great look of Hollywood mountains and the water reservoir which is also very interesting. After a few shots it was time to move on. It is a place to spend less than an hour, unless you‚Äôre going for a picnic, which can also be a good idea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robertopelomundo
50,Drive to 2799 Canyon Drive to park for great Hike,We put that address into our GPS and got great directions to the Bronson Canyon park. From there it is a pleasant hike up toward the sign. The dirt road is good quality and we left early in the morning when it was cool and pleasant. Highly recommended hike to an iconic sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilLMaun_Botswana
40,Great view from near the Kodak Theatre,Shown this tip by a tour guide. Just go up the escalators and at the top you can see a really clear view for photos for the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle36Melbourne
30,Over rated,I don't know what I was expecting but it is just a sign. It can only be seen during the day as it is not lit up at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistic09
50,Great Hike to beautiful views,"I really enjoyed hiking up to the sign, although you can't get to the sign you can get pretty close above it and have a nice view from below also. You have options. We started at Bronson Canyon and it was about 7 miles round trip. Stunning views across the hills and the city. It's not all that hard but you need to be somewhat physically fit as it's uphill almost all the way there.Do it, it's fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgflys
30,Something you just gotta do!,"For those of us who live in LA, the iconic Hollywood sign is always fun to point out to our countless visitors and houseguests!When training for the LA Marathon, I would run around Lake Hollywood which I would access from Pass Avenue, wind my way through curvy uphill streets and finally park along a curb and start jogging. I could see the sign from the jogging path and it was much a closer and longer glance than I could steal by averting my eyes from the road while driving on the 101 North! Try seeing the sign the way I've just described! Some daring souls actually park on the upper streets and try to see it from an almost eye-level location but the homeowners up in the Hollywood Hills don't have like it!!! Fair warning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S7679WXpaulam
30,Griffith Park is a nice place to hike but the sign isn't much to see,"The problem with the sign is if you hike to Mount Lee, the peak, you are behind the sign and there is a steep drop and therefore all you can see a couple of the letters behind a chain link fence. The trail comes from the side and so it's not like your getting great views approaching.You can hike down in front of the it and that's a nice view but your not that close. It's a fairly long hike and there is significant ascent so it's not a real easy hike. We didn't have a problem but we hike regularly. We hiked in from from a parking lot below the observatory.One big problem is the residents of Hollywood have caused to city to prohibit parking in the areas with trail-heads closest to the sign. So you need to be aware of parking regulations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_MTJ_99
40,Iconic view,"You can see the sign from all over downtown Hollywood but for a great view, drive up to Canyon Park at 3000 Canyon Lake Drive. Very narrow windy road if you come from south so the northern approach (Lake Hollywood Drive off of Barham) is strongly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kyleandrene
50,"HOLLYWOOD SIGN: Fun Hike, Awesome View","The Hollywood Sign hike is fun, easy, and rewarding from the top! It's a great outdoors activity that does not take up the whole day! There are several ways to do it and worth your while! The city can be overwhelming with traffic and utter chaos, so it's the perfect way to get away and get in touch with nature without having to go far and leave the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TROYDEEZY
40,At night not what I expected!,The signed is dark at night. You can not see the letters. Looks cool on daylight. you can see the letters from the Chinese Theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyRicePR
40,Best spot to take a picture,"When we were in downtown Hollywood to see the Dolby Theater we were told to walk through the mall when the Theater is located and that if we went up to the third floor of the open air mall we would see a bridge area where you were directly in front of the sign and would be able to get a picture. They were right. This shopping area also includes the Hard Rock Cafe, a number of shopping boutiques and the Walk of Fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41SharonT
40,Hollywood Sign,"You can't now go upto the sign. But there are a couple of good locations to take pictures of the sign with or without you in the picture. The first one is Griffith's Observatory previously written up about & also the car parking lot entrance to the Beachwood Cafe. The latter is accessed by driving up N Beachwood Drive, until you get to the junction where there is the Beachwood Cafe and Market on the left hand side of the street. As you make the left turn, on the right hand side there is a a horse shoe shape flower bush. Its the same site that is used by Channel 7 TV for there Hollywood outdoor news items so you may have some compeition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulH182
30,The sign and symbol,"We all know the sign.The best view Wil be from a far away.I drove very close, but it is much better to look at it from distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theworldanddaniel
40,Hike to the sign is fun but can also be VERY scary,"I visited LA with two restless teenage boys. We decided to hike up to the Hollywood sign. We started from the observatory because we thought (mistakenly) there would be rangers to get advice from or trail maps. Unfortunately, while there were hordes of tourists, there were no rangers in sight and no maps. So, we just started up the trail. We went into it knowing that there are three main trails to the sign--easy, moderate, and hard. But, the really hard part is that all these trails cross each other and that NOTHING is marked. There are no--as in ZERO--trailmarkers/signs. So, we began on the ""easy"" two mile path and somehow ended up on the moderate much, much longer path. At one point I am certain we were on the hard path as we ended up on a goat trail that was very narrow and had a nearly sheer drop off the side. Ultimately we got some good photos of the sign from different angles, but never could get all the way to the sign before dark. In fact, it got dark on the way down and without the help of some local bikers we would have been pretty lost up there.It was fun, but my recommendations for you are many if you are thinking of this: start very early in the day so that you don't risk trying to get down at night, print out maps from home to take with you, and (unless you have a great sense of direction and are experienced at hiking) consider taking a guided hike your first time or even one of the horse tours. Wear good hiking shoes--all we had were athletic shoes and they were okay but on the goat path hiking boots would have been better--and take water with you. Also, the temperature can be warm in the sun and cold in the shadows so a jacket is nice to have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muleyman
30,A must see but you do not get close,"You haven't been to LA if you don't have a picture of the Hollywood sign. If you go by car (as other hundreds of tourists every day) you need to park your car at a certain distance. The rest you need to walk. No problem to walk but even when you arrive at the top, you are far away from the sign. So better is to take half a day to walk the small pathways or bike to get closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family-van-den-Berg
30,Man pulled from his car and beaten,"Do not access the Hollywood Sign from Beachwood Canyon, or Barham Blvd. Last week a tourist was pulled out of his car and beaten, and the LAPD was called to arrest a photo seeker who broke the parking law and got into a physical altercation with a resident. It is no longer safe near the Sign. Instead go to the LA Observatory, or Runyon Canyon to see the Sign. There is great parking, hiking trails and more amazing views that include the Hollywood sign. Also the traffic under the Sign is a nightmare. Observatory better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
30,You are in Hollywood......,Well for me its an iconic sign and you take a picture just to ensure that you are in Hollywood.If you have great stamina then you can hike to the sign.Otherwise there are many places in LA from where you can take pictures.Like I had the oppertunity to take pictures with this sign at background from a mall adjacent to chinese theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaureenY
50,Need a pic!,If you can't make it close and want pic. Go over to the hollywood street and go into the mall facing the Dolby theatre. Go to the 3rd floor for a clear view and a good picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thezworld
50,Not much to it but still Awesome !,We drove around winding back streets until we found a spot over a dog park to take fantastic photos of the sign. We are actors so this was like a pilgrimage to the alter of Thespis. Totally worth the drive. Not sure if we really went the right way or got the full experience but will definitely go again soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WizardToby
20,Don't walk,"Don't do the walk, go to the observatory, the HIKE is more than most people would want to do on a holiday. You can see the sign from the centre next to the Chinese theatre on Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8089YGjohns
50,Its not about the sign,Doooooo this. This is such an experience. This is a challenge for your body mind and soul. It's not about the sign when you get to the top. It's about everything that happened along the way.You can also take horseback rides throughout the mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikkiD23

40,Why not,"To be in LA and not to see this sighn means not to be there. You need a car or a taxi to get there. It's better to go when the daylight in oder to make good photos. Here is nothing to do, just make photos and see the good view. No souvenirs, no food there to buy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vilena_dn

40,Breathtaking Views,"Unbelievably, the HOLLYWOOD sign is not lit up at night!It is quite a trek to get up there to stand behind the letters and see the 360o panoramic view. Totally worth the walk - if you are up for it. The shady side of the mountain can be very chilly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afazad
30,A historic name,The Hollywood sign is seen during a city tour of Los Angeles. But we can view it only from a very far distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/323divyab
40,Drive uphill and downhill is the real beauty,Legendary place but I would endorse the drive and overall feel offered by the area. Scenic and peaceful. I am not sure how the weather is generally at this altitude but on 25th December it was super windy and chilly. It was difficult to take pictures as it was difficult to stand straight.The sign does look somewhat attractive at night but nothing great. The best view is from Hollywood Boulevard viewpoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suchig06
50,Cool sight to see,I have seen the sign on TV so many times but to see this on a business trip was really cool! I would not have traveled from Florida just to see the Hollywood sign but I could not wait to drive down (2.5 hours) to see this wonderful historic sight.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanRockhillrefuge
30,Hard to get close to,Tried to drive closer to the sign via the observatory but was so busy around 10am we turned away. Kept looking for a better spot but yet to find it. Off the main Hollywood strip there is a centre with a water feature with 3 floors. Top floor is probably the best place I found by accident.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seagull021
50,"One of the ""Must Do's"" / Best picture spot: Canyon Lake Drive","For me it was one of the ""Must Do's"" in Los Angeles. Hardest decision was the on from which spot to take a picture.

40,Amazing view but so confusing!,"View at the top is beautiful! The only downside is that it is very confusing getting there.. My advice is to really research blogs for how to get to the sign because 1. There are many road signs in the residential area that ""no parking""/""no access"" for the Hollywood sign, but many people were parked and walking towards the entrance and when we asked the security guard if this was the right way, he was so friendly! So confusing.2. There is a paved path that horse riders use too but no directions whatsoever when two paths diverge, etc. we took the wrong turn once and had to turn Around. Going back down we took the wrong way and got lost, had to turn back.The view is really worth it, but again, research how to get there and don't go on a tight time schedule since chances are you will get lost! A pretty easy hike though, not too much incline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/600gabrielleg
40,Nice,The hike was long but a great workout. I was able to get to the top of the mountain. You're not allowed to actually get too close to the sign but you can take a good pic on your way up the trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chatmoiselle

50,Great memory!,Had 1 day to sightsee in Hollywood and decided to drive up to the Hollywood sign to takes some pictures with my family. Found a suggestion on line to use a GPS to go to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive which puts you right at the dog park below the sign. This was definitely the best place to take pictures of the sign and you can park along the curb on one side of the street. My photo here was taken just above the dog park - a great memory from our trip to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaglesFan11
40,Okay,A must-go place for every tourist who visits Los Angeles. But the car must be parked far from the sign so you have to walk for a few minutes to reach the sign. A dog park is also available so you can bring your dogs there for evening walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afzasones
20,Tour stop,I took a day tour to see the Hollywood sign. To my disappointment you are unable to get close to it and the letters are as small as ants in the distance.Unless you have a camera with a great zoom I wouldn't bother wasting my time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniW_86

30,Takes one hour at brisk pace from Lake Hollywood Avenue,"Can be tricky for unfit or unwilling persons from the Lake Hollywood Avenue side. If you have someone like that in the party go from the other side.Takes one hour at brisk pace from Lake Hollywood Avenue.There's nothing to do at the sign, and you can no longer get to the sign either, it's fenced off and patrolled.This is just another viewpoint of LA, similar to that from Griffiths Observatory and multiple other viewpoints, so if you're not into hiking, there's no reason to go. This is about hiking, nothing else.No food or water available so take some with you.Let me just say that again. This is about hiking. If you don't like hiking, don't fo to the sign!

The same location where i took this picture is also close to Chinese theater, El Capitan theater, wax museum, the former Book city - now closed - spot where Madonna filmed couple of shots for her video for ""Deeper and Deeper"", the Roosevelt hotel and many more. also very easy to get there, since the junction of Highland and Hollywood is where the metro red line station is located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meeoozeek

Walk up to top of neighborhood hill and head to Horse Back Riding gate where you'll see gate on left side. Push open gate and follow signs to Hollywood sign. Quite a long hike switching back and forth to top of hill (steep) behind Hollywood sign. Best pictures are quarter way up with sign in background.

30,Side benefits of the effort are better than the main event,"You'll be disappointed that the best views are far away and taking an iconic photo with a humanoid in the same frame (while still being able to read ""HOLLYWOOD"") is an impossible mission. Zoom cameras are required. However, driving to Griffith Park and/or taking the scenic turnout along Mullholland Drive are both nice trips with great views that are well worth looking for the sign and the cityscape from different perspectives. Try following a tour bus with your windows rolled down to get the added benefits of a guided adventure (and knowing where to stop).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,A Must See,We saw the Hollywood sign from a few different places and either far away or close up it must be huge..The sign seems to be the most talked about and looked at..We found it up on the steps near the Chinese theatre or a good spot its at the Griffith observatory,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryM493
20,Why visit. You can see it from anywhere.,The Hollywood sign originally said Hollywoodland and was part of a housing development. Later the land was removed and it became the iconic sign. I guess if you are a tourist and want people to know you've been to Hollywood you can wander up there. In truth the glamour days of Hollywood ended about 60 years ago. If you feel you must see the sign to tell your friends back home go ahead. I see it everyday from my office.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
10,Not lit at night!,"So everyone goes on about where to view the sign, we tried to do it from the mall next to the Dolby theatre at night! Not realising that the sign is no longer illuminated. Very disappointed as we knew where the sign was located but no chance to see it.The best place is from within Paramount studios, it is such an icon and it was a special place to see it from. Go take a tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taffdiver

30,hard to get close to,It was great to see this famous sign but it was so hard to get close to take pictures. We found the best spot to be Griffith Park,
40,Fun to see an Iconic Image,It's just a sign but there is something special about seeing something that you have always seen on film. It is exciting and fun to see. We got a great photo from the Griffith Observatory.,
40,Hollywood Sign - Woth the Trip,"The road to the top of the hill to see the sign is very narrow and sometimes you have to pull over to allow anothe car to pass by. It has all kinds of housing, from contemporary homes hanging on a cliff, to story book castles, nestled in ivy walls. We traveled up the road on a whim but we glad we took the journey. It was fun!",
50,secret road,We really wanted to see the hollywood sign so we searched through the internet for some secret paths to get there.. we've chosen the right one and got to the best place. awesome view+great place+ something you must see when you're in LA :),

50,Always wanted to see it,"Granted it's not much different than just looking at a picture, it's neat to be able to see it in person.

50,An experienced hikers' fun time.,"There's several ways to get to the sign. The hiking trail we picked ended up behind the sign, so we were looking down at it.

10,Why do people go here?,There is no way to get to the Hollywood sign. Stop trying. Stop bothering the people that live nearby. Stop. It's an old wooden sign that was meant to be temporary.

50,Iconic must see when in LA !,"We decided to do the Hike to the Hollywood Sign unfortunately due to the original car park we were heading for being closed we ended up on a very long 1hr 30mins each way hike . This was made all the worse as we had decided to start our hike at 12:00 midday . Be warned the hike to the sign where ever you start it seems to be uphill all the way with NO shade so take hats , sun cream , comfortable shoes and PLENTY of water as there is nowhere to get anything to drink and be prepared for a long uphill walk . Once you reach it , it is a sight to behold and makes for some great photo opportunities ! Worth it but go prepared .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinacs2015
40,Iconic sign for photo taking,"We rented a car during our visit to the west coast. From online reviews, we found that driving along Canyon Lake Drive to Lake Hollywood viewing point was the best option. Right after the peak, there was temporary parking along the road shoulder. We saw several cars there so it was easy to locate. It was not crowded since it was only accessible by car. Decent shots of the sign could be taken from there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drnoelyeo
50,Worth a visit,"There are a lot of places to see the Hollywood sign, the best of them up the top, where you can work out through your way up and down, if you like sport, it's the perfect place to go jog or walk, there is nothing else going on there except for the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hk66alkhalifa

50,Only takes about an hour to hike up there,"I'm an older lady in good but not great shape, and I made it in about an hour including about a half mile hike to the trailhead since it was a weekend. Watch out for the horse poop along part of the trail. You can only get as close as the chain link fence will allow, but it's still pretty impressive. If you go on a week day, you can park closer to the trailhead. Check out info. on line so you don't miss the one hairpin turn to the left and get onto the wrong trail! Otherwise, you can't get lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
40,don't be fooled!!,"Its an iconic sight and one we all want to see but I must warn you that a) generally getting a roadside parking space within half a mile of the observatory is hard let alone to the car park itself so beware and b) unless you fancy a serious hike ( its not accessible by car ) and I mean at least an hour and a half round trip, you wont get to the sign itself.Its still a cool place and the views from the Observatory are simply stunning but take the proper footwear",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17stevej
30,"Kinda cool to see, but really it's not that big a deal",You can see the sign from quite a distance on clear days and it's kinda cool to see when you've seen it on TV and in movies for a long time. Getting there isn't easy and the neighbors aren't exactly happy to see you park your car so that you can walk up to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorisG537
50,Must See in LA,"I am lucky as one of my homes has a view of the sign.

If you must drive past it on your way to somewhere else. Don't bother going to the top of it. There is nothing to see. It is just a sign. Better yet, skip it all together and just get the postcard. Locals couldn't care less about this ""Landmark.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Pretty Cool...But go to Griffith to See It.,"The big disappointment for most folks is that you can't get up close to the sign. Well you can, but you will likely be arrested.You can walk a trail and get close-ish...but expect a very long trek and don't forget the heat. When you get there it's not one bit photogenic.I'd recommend hitting the Griffith Observatory for the view and as a bonus you get tons more to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocD77

40,Classic LA - see it from Griffith Observatory ...,"Yes, when you visit LA you gotta see the Hollywood sign & believe me you will from multiple angles & multiple locations.

50,Still an iconic symbol of Los Angeles!,"I used to live in LA --- then, and in more recent years when I visit about 4x yearly, I always smile at seeing the Hollywood sign. I smile because it is a stark but dramatic visual and iconic symbol of Los Angeles but also because I knew the parents of one of the miscreants who one night, back in the 60's or 70's, pulled a great prank, changing the sign from ""Hollywood"" to ""Hollyweed"" (probably being high on weed at the time themselves!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trup

It's popular.Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486kellyf
30,"Nice for taking a souvenir photo near by, but in the end is jus a sign on hill!","Hollywood sign is located at Hollywood hills, need Burbank. It is not accessible to the public, although you can get fairly close if you drive around and know your way or if you take a hike.It doesn't have any touristic facility on site, so appart from a good spot for taking a background picture, there is nothing else to see or do directly there. A good spot for taking a picture with the sign from a good distance, arriving by car and with something else to do, would be from Grifith Observatory's terrace or parking lot, the sign is just in front, pretty much at the same height.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fhurtadoc

The winding road that leads up to the most visible spot, is riddled with amazing old and restored homes, They seemed to just hang off the cliffs.

30,Have to get picture of that,One of the landmarks you have to see when you visit LA. Was difficult to find right spot for good view. Finally we went to Griffith Observatory. There was good parking space and good view at the Hollywood sign. The day later we went to Universal Studio's were you can make great picture with Hollywood Sign on background at the end of the studio tour ride. Nobody can see the difference :-),

40,Hike to top of Hollywood sign,If you want to get the best possible shot. Stop the mountain BEHIND the Hollywood sing looking out across Los Angeles .. You need to go up to the Griffith park observatory..as you follow the road up .. Before you get to the observatory .. You'll see a tunnel .. Park along the street there.. Off to the side you'll see a paved road .. With a gate .. Start your hike there .. Follow the paved road for about 45 mins .. Great views ..when you get to the FIRST dirt trail that goes off to the LEFT ..take that ... Pik down below so you see what it looks like ..follow this dirt trail .. Always stay in it even tho other dirt roads merge it ect .. After about 25-30 mins you'll come upon another PAVED road that goes UP to your right ..take that paved road ..another picture below ...

50,A great Hike,"If you're into hiking. Hiking to the Hollywood Sign is always fun. Because I live under the sign, I may be somewhat biases. Anyhoo, it's approximately a 2 hour hike, unless you're out of shape like my friends. So be sure you've set aside time in case you're hiking mates are slow walkers. In all it's an enjoyable experience to be able to say you've hiked up to/behind the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thisgirl_Gray
50,HOLLYWOOD SIGN,We had a car rental and were told to go Lake Hollywood Park and we did WOW you can see the sign so well and there are a lot of tourists there.

Beautiful scenery of LA also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baghdadlian
40,"Great photo op, do your research for the best way to check it out","Figured this was a must see while visiting L.A. so I did a little bit of looking around online. It seemed like a lot of people complained about having to drive through residential neighborhoods with narrow streets to visit this attraction. I would recommend avoiding all of hassle, as the sign is visible from quite a few locations around the area. I used google maps to check out some places where we might be able to see it and we were fairly successful at most of them. We also had a pretty good view of it while visiting Griffith Observatory.I also read several people's accounts of hiking to the sign. My wife was 5 months pregnant at the time, so it wasn't an option. However, this also seems like a cool possibility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brockm118
40,Brilliant to see such a famous sign!,We could see the sign from our hotel room and got a closer view from the bus when we took a tour. It was interesting to hear the history behind the sign but disappointing as you could not see it at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciamty
50,HOLLYWOOD SIGN,I went there for hiking and it's was excellent trails but I found some secret trails for short cut way to reach on the top hollywood sign. I don't recommend for beginner hiking on the secret trails because a lot rocks and may be easy to get hurt or fall out. For the beginner should go on easy trail but long way for walking to the top hollywood sign. I noticed there have a bus shuttle but not sure if the shuttle bus will drive up to the top hollywood for the disabled.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPCA
10,NO LIGHT Very hard to get too,To see even part of the sign you have to go up a VERY STEEP residental neighborhood and still cant access it . IF you go around through the incredible traffic it will take about 40 min . You still cant get anywhere to actually take a pic of it . You can go to the Griffin observatory for a great view of it but it has no light so going at night you are out of luck and the sign needs a serious FACE LIFT . Doesnt seem anyone but tourists care about it . Not what i thought it would be .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MomSharon

40,We finally saw it! Hollywood!,We arrived in LA - very much looking forward to seeing this famous sign!We were lucky enough to get our first glimpse on our first day from the Hollywood & Hyland shopping centre! Briefly - as daylight was fading! For whatever reason we were under the impression that the sign was lit at night - so we were a little disappointed as we had hung around till darkness had fallen to see this! We got a closer look when we visited Griffith Observatory! We loved learning the history around the sign while on our travels around LA. But still think it should be lit at night! Solar lights perhaps?? It is California after all - loads of sunshine around!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel_Cat75

No shade so pick an overcast day or low temps.Figure an hour each way plus time for photos at top and time to be mindful at the wisdom tree and rock sculptures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle

50,worth the hike,"An absolute must. It is a very cool thing to do, hike to the sign. Hiking to the sign isnot as easy at it looks. I am in pretty good shape and it still wasn't easy. Plus wehiked the horse trail and found that the further we hiked the further the sign appeared to be.I would say we went about 75% up the hill, got some fabulous photos along the way but opted not to hike to the very top. There are several ways to do it and several ways to get there, we parked in a neighborhood midweek and the security guard was kind enough to let us park in a permit only neighborhood. I would say that was the exception so definitely plan ahead as far as parking and which route you want to take. Wear sensible shoes, bring a camera and a bottle of water.",
30,I wonder what all the fuss is about. Average landmark.,"We were in the USA doing the Disney land, MGM circuit. We decided to have a look at the sign. Apart from everyone saying you must see it, I was unimpressed, nothing about seemed remarkable. Just another landmark to tick off.",
50,Hollywood Baby,The best place to see the sign is ether to hike to the sign or drive up to the Griffith Observatory.,
50,Always cool,"I walked along the trails near the Griffith Obsevatory with two UK mates I'd met in New York (I'm Australian) to the Hollywood sign. It was hot and dusty but well worth it. You can't get too close because of fencing and security, but we came as close as you legally can and it is very cool. After seeing this iconic sign so mant times on TV and film it was a magic moment to see it with my own eyes...check it out!",
30,Eh,"I guess this sign is so iconic that people need to have their photo in front of this but when you grow up in CA, it really doesn't have the same appeal.",
50,You gotta see the Hollywood sign!,"You can see the sign from many vantage points in Los Angeles. My favorite is a little park on Mulholland Drive just west of Cahuenga and the 101. Your first view is of the 101 Freeway and Hollywood. You may recognize it as it is used in stock footage in many TV shows and movies. There's a trail up a small hill where you can see the sign, the Hollywood Bowl, and a stunning view of the city. On a clear winter day you can easily see the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyo181
30,It's a sign. And it says Hollywood!,You can see the sign from all over so I wouldn't bother making a trip to it especially. Great when you first see it but it's not really an attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurlyJo2014
50,Awesome to see in person!,The Hollywood sign has been a must see since forever. So happy I was able to see this up close and in person!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630shanels
50,Hollywood Icon Must See,"I often walk around Lake Hollywood, under the shadow of this iconic sign. It doesn't do anything - it's just there - but what is a visit to LA if you don't get a shot of the sign?It's visible from many places - a lot of people do the easy Hollywood and Highland Mall view, or can go up to Lake Hollywood, or do the pony trekking thing.. I have hiked up to above/beyond the sign - for amazing views over the city. Another good spot is from Griffith Observatory, knock out a few things at once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806
40,Windy but worth it,Great view of the city! This iconic sign you see on tv and in the movies is worth the trip. Very very windy do be prepared for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/944lynnettet
30,Great view from Griffith observatory,"If u wanna see the sign just go to the Griffith observatory early in the morning and you will get a good parking spot and a great view, plus the observatory is free. This trip we only saw the sign, because we had plans and couldn't wait for observatory to open, but we will check that out with the kids next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingW2341NS
40,Shame we couldn't touch,"Loved the sign, was great to see as it is so iconic, just a shame we could not touch it, the photo point is miles away, but still fantastic to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaandmartin
40,Plan ahead,We tried to hike to the sign on a whim at sunset. We only found an observatory point and couldn't get super close. Almost got lost on a bunch of trails we thought would lead us to the sign. Met a ton of traffic on the way down from the sign. Very crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissColoradoBird
30,HOLLYWOOD SIGN,The iconic HOLLYWOOD sign is a must see attraction when in LA. Griffith Park is a good place to see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cndwhite2308
40,It is what it is!,"You see the sign from all over, in varying states. It is nothing but a sign, but a sign I think each and everyone of us can instantly bring to mind. It was a view from my hotel room, from the famous homes tour, from the walk from the hotel to the Boulevard. It is Hollywood!I believe you can hike to the sign, but not drive to it, so it is best viewed from afar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53
30,Hollywood sign,A piece of California History and many dreams build but not many came to be. It was interesting mostly because I had seen it in the movies over the years and read about it. Good to see once and for me I am done and ready to move on,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486luket
40,Saw it,You can't get close to the sign unless you trespass. But if you drive around just the right streets you can get close enough to get a photo just like the one here. Off the bucket list now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretcheno546
50,Fantastic view,"Although it's forbidden to touch the sign itself, you can get close to it. The hiking trails around the mountain are beautiful and getting to the top is really worth it and not too difficult. The view of los angeles from the top is priceless. Unless there's a lot of smog that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/playb0yc
50,Nice walk,"When I stopped by in Los Angeles I was wondering where is the best place to see LA. Hollywood Sign is really fantastic point for it - you can see Universal studios, all LA and famous posh houses üòâ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/745petrv
40,You must have a selfie there,"You know you can't pass on a selfie there. Don't have to get to the sign, there are streets close where you can have your pic with the sign behind quite visible and show off later back home. You must prove you where there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesusenmochis
50,Once in a lifetime!,Checking it off the bucket list. Something about seeing the Hollywood sign live up in the Hollywood Hills that is priceless. Had a great time forgetting about reality for a few days! Great trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saintmels
40,Hollywood sign at Hollywood Hills,A must visit if you are in Los Angeles. The famous Hollywood Sign can be reached via parking at Griffith Observatory. You can park there for free and just begin your hiking up to the hills and to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/florianb362
30,There It Sits,"It's fun to see the Hollywood sign, but it's better to drive up the mountains to its east and visit the Observatory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/977he
50,The backdrop to everything,"You can see this from miles away.... However a visit to the top (you can't quite get to the actual sign) should be high on your list of things to do.I happen to get driven up there by a local at sunset and the view is out of this world, you can see the whole of Hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tfage
50,Most Popular Icon in LA,"This is the most popular icon in Los Angeles, however it was getting more difficult to get the best place to take photo with this icon as the background.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AL080808
40,Los Angeles trip,"Great view if you view from Kodak theatre , I went to Gariftti park also for a closer view but still prefer kodak theatre near to walk of fame",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayaz1974
50,Awesome,"Again it is something you always see in the movies, so it was really neat to see it in person. Of course I was not close by any means, but still got to see it from a distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716carolynb
50,A wonderful Must hike,"I went to visit my daughter at USC and she asked if I'd ever hiked up the Hollywood sign? I had not. We went all the way up. It is a well marked trail, moderately easy and most enjoyable! A MUST hike on your next LA visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katherine1412
40,A nice spot to hike from Groffith Observatory,"This was a place I hiked some years ago with Friends and it was worth it. The hike would take a leisure two hours from the Observatory, Bring a bottle of water and once you reached the site the view is fantastic. Please note that the sign itself is fenced and cannot be entered. For the less adventurous this hike maybe a challenge but otherwise can me a good cardio route.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butchrey
50,Worldwide Iconic Sign,"The famous sign is just in view where I stay in Hollywood! For a really good view drive up the winding hill road past the sign - its history makes you tingle with memories! Hard to park close just under the sign, but OK further up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/953jim
30,Disappointed,We went to visit the famous Hollywood sign and I was very disappointed. The sign looks very big in all the advertising magazines or on television but it is really quite small and insignificant. In fact all of Hollywood was rather a letdown.,
50,Nice hike!,you need to get ready to hike to get to the sign but i think it is better if you see it form other angle. You will get a better view of the sign not the back of it hahaha. Go to the hill next to it or just go down the hill of the sign.,
50,Must See,We visited here during our recent vacation--a must see-great view and fun pictures....and a pretty drive.,
40,You have to see the Hollywood sign,"You just can't go to Hollywood without seeing the ""Hollywood"" sign! You can see it from a few different locations but most of the time it is so far away! We did go to one lookout spot which gave you a beautiful view below and the sign. You need a good zoom to take close pictures though.",
50,Iconic,"Walked up to great viewing spot. Yes, it's only a sign but, it's iconic. Great views of LA too and a really nice walk up through Hollywood hills homes",
50,Icon LA Sign,"Best way to view this sign is from the observatory, street level or tour bus.We felt the tour bus didn't make enough fuss of this sign n regard to photo opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivacat12
30,Disappointed,"Me and my husband found it quite difficult to find somewhere we could take a good photo of the Hollywood sign.Our hotel printed out directions of how to get there.The roads up to the sign are steep and narrow. One of the roads had a sign to say no access residents only. In the end we ignored the sign and drove up the road anyway.We got to the top and parked our car where we was not really supposed to park there.There were signs everywhere saying it is illegal to hike up to the sign. Again we ignored the sign and walked up a hill where we managed to get a decent photo of us with the sign.The next day we walked down Hollywood Boulevard and people was offering a trip which takes you to the sign, I think that might be a better option than trying to go yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natp44
40,Hollywood,It is what it is. A big sign on a hill in Los Angeles that is a must photograph for the family album.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hasher66
50,Nice hike!,Walked from the Griffith observatory to the sign with is a nice one hour hike if you walk slowly. Great view and really nice and quiet.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tosemy
30,The world famous Hollywood Sign,"I was quite disappointed when I first caught sight of the sign on a cloudy day up in the Hollywood Hills. Our tour guide told us that no-one can get too close as the letters stand on private ground, and consequently, you can only view the sign at some distance. For such an iconic landmark, it left a disappointingly minimal impression. Granted, the dull and overcast weather didn't help, and the fact that the tour bus was unable to stop for more than a few seconds because the road we were on was busy, but I think we got a better view from Hollywood Boulevard in the shopping arcade, where, standing on one of the bridges you have an uninterrupted view. You'll need a zoom lens though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/501paulah
40,A sight from lots of angels,I do believe its hard to get up and close to the sign but i would advise seeing it from the Griffith observatory or streets below.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GCsk50
20,Please dont fall in that trap!,"It is what it is, you can see it from a lot of places, now move along and go visit real stuff! there is so much more to do in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/250ninam
50,Great landmark,It was a thrill to visit this site which is unique to hollywood. I was surprised to find out it was actually placed there by a developer and not the film industry. I also appreciate thr fact that celebrities had to rebuild it when it was falling apart by buying letters and then had to raise funds to ensure that no development is built near it. Quite an interesting history around this landmark. Please visit it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Classychic
50,A must see!,My friend and I drive to the closest point we possibly could and took photos. It would be amazing if we could get closer but you can still see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindy1001
30,Bring. A. Map.,"The sign is a classic, however impossible to find a way to get up here. In fact, they have closed public access so don't waste your time. Enjoy from the bottom of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kondy1
20,Disappointed,"The shuttle to the sign is not in service. Whether this is temporary or not was not clear on the tourist information. This meant that you had to walk 3 miles which was something my husband could not do. Had to go on a bus tour to a high point, on a different hill a mile away, then zoom in to take a photo. So no photos of us at the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brit-xpat
50,Gotta see the sign,"....and have your picture taken with it. Yes, it will be tiny, but hey, it's Hollywood. A must see on any trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky14217
30,Not what I expected,You can no longer get close to the sign so the visit was not what I expected. We took pictures with the sign in the background and you can barely read it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gloria191959
50,Amazing,"This was on our 'To Do' list whilst visiting LA. After several brief glimpses whilst driving along the streets below, my wife and I decided to see how close we could get to the sign.We followed some very bendy and steep roads marvelling at the homes as we climbed. We reached the entrance to the ranch and thought that was the end of the journey. However, thanks to directions from a local we managed to continue upwards.Finally, we arrived at a spot where the sign was clearly visible. There were also,stunning views over LA. The location must be popular because there was even an ice cream van there.If you visit LA, you really must visit this iconic site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWT123
50,Brillaint views!,Very long walk up to the sign but was worth it as the views of LA are amazing. Make sure you take drinks with you as there is no place to buy them there. A must do in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nesawara
30,Cant go close to the sign,The tours take you to viewpoint on a hill opposite so people can take photos from a distance. That said its still an iconic sign that shouldn't be missed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ancsi50
40,Photo opportunity,We stopped here during our road trip to get photos of us with the sign. The sign was not a close as I expected from the pictures I have seen of other peoples at the same place. I am still pleased that we stopped there our pictures are lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hebe_7
10,It's just a sign........that's all,Most people expect more...but really..just a sign......see something else..you can see it from the roadside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracyandjjtravels
40,Exciting,"I think everyone has seen pictures of the Hollywood Sign, however, driving on the highway it sort of comes upon you and sends chills up your spine. It denotes so many things. When on Hollywood Blvd, the sign is very visible in the distance and still emits a strong emotion. So many famous people have lived and died under the fame and stigma of Hollywood. I visit often and never get tired of seeing it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shirleybeth11
50,Seein the sign,"We didn't hike to the sign because we heard it was 3 hours and that you cannot get close to it anyway, you end up on the backside of the sign. We went to the look out and it was perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296rr
40,a sign,"It is a big sign up on a hill, has a lot of history of Hollywood. You cannot go up there a touch it, but when you are looking up at it, look down and you will see the Hollywood Stars and all the strange people on Hollywood Blvd. Very different but a lot of fun, see it at least once. Like Times Sq. in New York....must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peach509
40,Fun Hunt for Pictures,We accessed the sign via the observation center and then hiked up the road for a photo spot. Wasn't prepared for a full day of walking as we were only in Hollywood for the day. Had fun trying to get that perfect picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ofche001
50,LA's Landmark,"It's Los Angeles' most recognizable landmark, isn't it! You can see it for miles, throughout the city but it's worth getting closer to see it for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamshaz
50,great experience,Never thought i would ever almost touch the Hollywood sign! but I did it a few days ago and it was great and magical!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giorgydelc
40,To say you've seen it is enough,HiAs seen from Griffith Observatory the iconic Hollywood sign was finally viewed.Having grown up watching movies etc I always wanted to see it.Its impressive even from a distance but it is what it is ...Iconic!!Nice views too from up there plus the drive and surrounding hills and valleys also impressive.Another thing to strike off the bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruud1
40,Must see In LA,Hollywood sign is iconic and needs to be seen when in LA. There are many places to view but try going on the streets directly in front of the sign as the views up in the hills arent too great as they are at an angle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravellerRC
50,A must see when you visit Hollywood,Great views from places a long the Hollywood Blvd. Seen in so many movies and TV shows. A definite trademark of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeMCanada
40,Hollywood Icon!,This is a must see if you are in L.A. The best place to be photographed near the sign is from the Griffith Observatory. Although the sign is still far away it is great to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4444Anna4444
40,The iconic sign.,"We saw the sign from the Griffiths Observatory. Good place to view it from but very hot and not much shade. The Observatory is shut on Monday so if we are trying to catch both attractions, go another day.You also get a good view of the sign from the shopping centre near the Walk of Fame, but it isn't as good as The Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleMark
40,Viewed from the Walk of Fame,We saw the Hollywood sign from afar from a 3rd floor shopping centre near the Walk of Fame. My husband was able to get excellent photographs from this point with a powerful lens on his camera. We were glad we did this rather than waste time trying to get a closer view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pip-F1
20,don't go out to hollywood sign,"best view is from the kodak but it is a few miles away,operated the sign.but wouldn't waste the time to go out to see it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Limerick86
30,Nice photo spot.,If you're booking a tour that says hollywod sign on the flyer be sure to confirm with your driver that you'll be going there. They put all sorts on the tour flyers to sell tours and then the driver just goes where he pleases. Luckily someone else on our bus spoke up about this and we got to see it and take the obligatory photo in front of it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P3932AIpatc
50,Impossible to locate but worth the effort!,There is an actual route that you can take to circle up and around the sign. The view are simply outstanding. The road winds through a house development and they are quite winding and narrow at times. Beautiful picture spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70crystalt
20,View point way too far!,"We went to Griffith observatory as per google maps but that view point was way too far, also the day we went observatory parking was full and had to treck 30 mins to reach the view point. They should have kept the parking lot full sign ahead so we could have planned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/53lakshmanr
50,Hollywood Icon,Hike to the top and see this sign up close and personal - It is iconic and historic. On a beautiful day you can see Catalina Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754cathyn
40,If you are in LA you must see the Hollywood Sign,Will in LA you have to see the famous Hollywood Sign. Personally I think the best place to see it and get a picture of it is at the Griffith Observatory. You are not going to be able to get up close and personal but you can get a fantastic picture. There are no lights on the sign so don't bother trying to see the sign at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arielmoon
50,Visit the sign where in Los Angeles,Our family drove straight to the Hollywood sign and there is a perfect place to take your photos. Fantastic view and great experience. Everyone who visits Los Angeles should likewise see the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nitzl
40,It's a must,"When you're in LA it is just one of those things you have to do. Don't expect to much of the sign. Don't go at night, because than you can't see a thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendyy_brink

40,"Can't visit LA and not see ""the sign""",Didn't take the hike up to the sign which of course would be the best way to experience it. Other than that we found the best spot to see it was from the Griffith Observatory - though the only other spot we saw it from was on a bus tour when we stopped overlooking the Hollywood Bowl.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2Tig
30,A short pleasure,"ok, u have to see the sign once in your life. but thats it, just a few letters on a mountain. and hard to reach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lostana
40,It must be Hollywood ...It says so!,"Everyone knows it, has seen it, loves it. It used to say Hollywoodland but the word land was dropped after awhile on a site where the sign was only supposed to be for a short time. can you imagine the area without it.There can be no doubt that this has become one of the iconic sights in the world and one that I suspect always makes you smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sky051
40,difficult to get close,Amazing to see such an iconic site. It's tricky to get close though without heading right up into the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andy_B_Leeds
30,Had to see it,We took a Hollywood tour from outside the Chinese theatre. Diver was most informative about the area and drive us to a vantage point where we could see the Hollywood sign and the Hollywood bowl. View was great and have the pictures to prove we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelvynG463
40,Famous landmark visible from Hollywood,"This iconic landmark is clearly visible from many places along Hollywood Boulevard, as well as Mullholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. It's old now, but still a special part of LA.",
50,"""It puts the HOLLYWOOD in Hollywood.""",This sign epitomises all that is Hollywood. It's what all the travel brochures show on their pages and on the Internet travel sites...so it is what most people want to see when travelling to Hollywood. The sign is great.,
50,See it from another angle,"Viewing the sign from Sunset Blvd is amazing but if you really want an expierence travel to the top of the mountain. There is a paved street with a few houses. As a matter of fact. The Jackson 5 lived in one of these houses in the 70s. Anyway drive to the rear of the sign. You not only get the opportunity to see how it's built, not to mention it size but your rewarded with a spectacular view.",
40,Don't climb up here!,"It's an icon, yes, but once you've seen it there's not much more to it. Great view from Hollywood and Highland.....",
20,OK,I liked the sign but it is to crowded. They charged $3 for one soda because they knew nobody brought drinks.,
20,Really cool to see in person,"This is definitely something that everybody wants to see, but once you get there, it isn't that great. You can't really get very close to it, and it just looks a little run down. I still enjoyed seeing it, I guess that I just expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnyD68
40,Hollywoodland was the original name on the sign.,The Hollywood Sign is visible from Hollywood Bl and area around Hollywood. The sign is a famous spot in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisz282

40,Fantastic views... Almost an adventure to get there,"I really recommend to do this if you have even an small sense of adventure. To get there from LA you have to drive around hills. The view from the road is just fantastic. People living here is not really nice, but I can understand, too many tourists around. The place is fantastic and you have an amazing view from the valley and the city all around the circuit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmandoEsquivel
40,Cant get close to it,Wanted to see the Hollywood sign up close but you are unable to do this as it is not assessable. We saw it from Hollywood boulevard on the 3rd floor you get a decent view and good pictures. This is iconic and a must see while in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Missey2
40,Iconic,You have to take a picture of the Hollywood sign. Try the mall at Hollywood and Highland. It has upper floors for a better view.,
30,The Hollywood Sign at the Overlook,"Whenever people come to visit Los Angeles, many of them want to have pictures taken at where the Hollywood sign is, as proof that they had been to LA. There are many places to take pictures at of the sign, but the most popular place and best view of the sign is at the Hollywood Sign Overlook. It is only kind of tricky going there as you will be passing through residential areas and winding narrow roads. If you have a GPS just set it at Hollywood Sign Overlook and you will be led to the place.",
30,Pretty cool to see,Like others have stated look just like in the movies. If you are in LA in is worth the drive to see part of history.,
50,went to the observatory nearby to get a great shot of the sign,"drove up to the observatory that trip adviser said is the best place to get a picture of the Hollywood sign and they were correct as far as im concerned. the view was perfect, you could take a shot straight on and see the sign very clearly.",
40,Have a nice Hike!,If you are planing on doing the hike to the Hollywood sign just make sure to carry enough sunscreen and water. During the hike you will find nice views of downtown L.A. and Griffith Observatory so make sure to have a nice camera.,
50,Mandatory Photos: Check,"If you have a car and you're visiting the area, you have to get a photo or two. Worth the visit. Drive to the observatory carpark and take a few happy snaps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6219WTmichaelh
20,Must see,Overlooks smoggy L.A. ..its quiet far up and back. It looks just how it does on tv but its cool to actually see it in person and have a picture done. There are a few different lookout points to see it at also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natasha00176
30,steep and dusty....not so glam!!,"to be honest, the day we went was one of those really hot LA days that sneaks up when you least expect. The climb was dry and brown and dusty and actually rather unpleasant, but the reward is the view. Its great to see LA from that perspective.Take water, go to the bathroom prior and if you take a dog remember to take bottled water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/framinles

40,"Ah, the elusive Hollywood Sign...a Must See, but not easy to find if not on a tour.","Saw the sign briefly from Mulhulland Drive, from afar. Not into hiking to get closer.

50,Hollywood Sign,"You can see the Hollywood signs from many areas. Hollywood and Vine offer the best views. There is even a bench to sit on to take a ""selfie"" to get the sign perfectly in your photograph! The first place we saw the famous sign was from Paramount Studios! The tour guide gave us some history about the sign which really was a plus when at the studio. It is something you must see while in Hollywood!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9Buffalolady20
30,Nice hike,Took a walk up where some family members could get a picture of the sign. The area near the stables used to be open for parking. Today we found the street blocked off with a security guard blocking the street. One of our party dropped off the rest and drove quite a distance down the hill to park the car. Hopefully there are other access points to the park where you can leave your car. Nothing like making a tourist attraction difficult to get to! The street we used was Beechwood. There are some great views from the trails in the park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/10ringtraveler
50,LA Must See,"There are lots of ways to see the sign. If you're not up for a hike, take the metro to Hollywood Highlands and catch a great view of it from the third story of the stairwell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P1214CCdavidf
40,got to see it!,Went to the Hollywood bowl and climbed up the rpws of seats to get a good view of this .It seemed ages to get to the top and got a great view of this.Good photo opportunity if in Los Angeles it is a must do on your list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertpannell
40,Just as you have seen it in the movies,"What can I say. its the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign. You can take a hike up to the sign if you are feeling fit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreyNomads888
40,It's no different to what you have seen in 1000's of movies - but still pretty cool to see in real life!,"As soon as we landed in LA, our kids wanted to see the Hollywood sign so we headed up to Griffiths Observatory to check it out. Parking in a weekend is difficult here so we parked down the hill and walked up and it was certainly worth it. A beautiful view of the sign and the city. We also later discovered a great (and slightly closer view) from Gower St just off Franklin Ave in Los Feliz. I've been to LA before and had never seen it before but I'm glad we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larabe6
40,Hollywood,Not much to say really - it's the Hollywood sign! if you're in the area then worth a visit. We saw it from the Hollywood walk of fame and Griffith observatory - it's quite far away but you can see it just fine from these locations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apark155
10,Muh!,"Muh,Nothing Thant exciting about it!it is what it is a sign!look at it, job done!over rated and uninteresting I'm afraid!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flair1
50,If you like history see this,"I saw this on the Ultimate Hollywood Tour, This an amazing historical site and I loved seeing it, it is well worth the walk up the stairs to get a good view of it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foxm864
30,Classic LA Marker ....,It's the LA marque that's seen in movies and travel brochures. If you want to drive near its base you can & deal with irate neighbors tired of the fuss. Better vantage point is from the Observatory in Griffith Park. Nice view plus then yon can visit ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Hollywood sign,Unfortunately you cannot get very close to the sign anymore but we got a great view from our tour bus when going up to the hollywood homes and from the bus terminal where our tour left from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katrina791
40,Nice to pass through,"This is the most famous attraction , you can see it when you pass by your car on the hills of Los Angelo'sThe best is to visit before the sun goes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yasserradwan
40,"Cool To See, Can't Visit","The Hollywood sign (originally ""Hollywoodland"", an advertisement for a long-forgotten housing development) is a landmark and a beacon for all of Southern California within sight of it. It is sort of a reminder that this is La La Land. You can't really get up close enough to see it, touch it, feel it (that's good because vandals have tried many times to destroy it), but from a distance is the best way to see it and photograph it. I recommend the entrance to the Hollywood Forever cemetery as a top place to photograph it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jg3arrow
50,Do it,We drove up but the road was closed but got a close as we could and took our pictures from the road was great to see what you always see in the movies and on tv can't say much more as couldn't get all the way up but amazing to see it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danny84d
50,Touring my own town with out of town pals...fun!,"On a clear day you can see this iconic sign from where I live in Santa Monica near the sea but to drive up to it is a whole other adventure. Went here with out of town pals after taking them to Hollywood Blvd to see the stars. It's our Eiffel Tower...our only 'hey, I've been to LA' type photo you can take when you are here that tells the story in one image. All I can say is please respect the local people who live on the streets you must traverse to get there. Take a selfie and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
40,Nice view. - I think,"Due to time constraints, went to view the sign in the dark.. bad idea, the sign is NOT lit up with lights, like in the movies, which was really disappointing.I was also told to go to the Griffith observatory for a better view..The sign was visable with the naked eye but couldn't take any great photos, did spend time at the observatory..I didn't get a chance to see it in the day time..All in all I was nice to see iconic symbol of LA and movies, even in the dark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennyChan
40,Catching the view,It's up there for all to see.. Like many who come to visit Hollywood you need to get that quick look at the famous Hollywood sign and there it was up on the hill. Looks like it does in any photo but was a must to get on film..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieFyfe
50,Perfect selfie spot,It's a pleasant hike up to the sign. You have amazing views in every direction. There are multiple ways to get up there. Don't make the mistake of trespassing because the city will not be very lenient with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyFromPasadena
40,Great photo op,Yeah I know. It's just a sign. But a very iconic sign. You can't very well go to LA and NOT see it. - It is getting harder and harder to get to the spots where I saw it about a decade ago. I hear that the locals have even managed to manipulate Google Maps to keep all the tourists away. Anyways I drove up and found a spot where I could park my car and take the photo and it is NOT from Griffith park. You can get pretty good pictures from Mulholland Hwy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RW60s
50,Absolute must!!,If there's one thing you need to do in LA YOU NEED TO VISIT THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN! I've been quite a few times to LA and it's still the most iconic thing about Hollywood. If you can go up to the top of the Hollywood hills because the view is incredible. I've walked all the way to the top directly behind the sign- I would definitely recommend this too. You feel like you're on top of the world but if you have health concerns forget about it. It's so steep and fairly unsafe with rocks all over the road makin it uneven.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILVNY
30,You have to have a photo,We didn't try and get too close to the sign and took a photo from Hollywood Boulevard instead. It's something u have to have done but don't think it's worth climbing all the way up there to see it closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derby_davec
50,The Sign Has History,The Hollywood Sign was one of our favorite things in L. A. Either we were very lucky or our guide Emily at Your L. A. Tours knew just where to go. We had a perfect view from just below the sign and had no problem parking. The sign also has a very interesting history that we learned from our guide. A must see while in L. A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480cynthiaw
20,Once in lifetime,"From childhood watched this sign in movies. Very curious to go this place, atleast once in lifetime. It is a nice view and to take picture. But not so exciting to go second visit for this sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UdhayakumarG
50,Cool,"People who rate this less than 4- just ignore. The parking problem is annoying but if you can't park and people are calling cops on you, you did not do your research on how/ where to go and get there. Many people just ignore the signs and go touch it anyway, some know just the right place to get an amazing pic. Go to lake hollywood park- ok amount of parking and amazing views. The view looking toward the city behind the sign is also really cool. I mean come on, it has been in countless amounts of movies, you gotta go see it.",
50,The famous sign up close,"Two ways to get to this place either to the front of the sign or the back by taking the trail. The easiest to get to the sign is by the canyon drive: 2799 canyon drive, early is best due to small parking. This address will take you to the gate, drive in and park inside",
50,Have to do it!,"This is like a scavenger hunt with rules and regulations. If your kids want that up close selfie like ours, you'll have to do your research.Here is my recommendation. Ignore all the ""do not enter"" signs and get your moneys worth for your kids sake if not your own!We found an exact address where you get the sign behind you, but you cannot walk to it like so many movies portray. When you head up the hill to the spot, there are countless signs and watchers calling the police fairly routinely. Wait below the signs until you spot a cop on detail leaving the signed area then make you way up after 5 or so mins. Get quick shots and no doubt on your way down the hill in your vehicle you will spot the cop heading back up because of routine or people complaining.Live a little!",
40,Iconic Real Estate Sign,"I didn't really know the full story of the sign until I did a tour of LA. It was erected in 1923 originally to promote the sale of land in the new land subdivision called Hollywoodland. That didn't work out too well for the developers due to the impending Great Depression, but the sign stayed, fell into disrepair in the 1960s when there was a downturn in the industry and was saved in the 1970s and resurrected with bright new letters made to last (with some large fund raising by Hugh Hefner and others). Situated in the lovely Griffith Park, it can be seen from all around downtown LA but there are a number of notable places for good camera shots. The Griffith Observatory gets you a great view and so does the upper level of the Hollywood and Highland Shopping Mall (go around the back of the food area on the Upper Level and walk along the bridge and look between the large elephants (yes I know that sounds weird).",
50,Up close to the sign.,Got real close by going up the hill from the usual lookout and it was quiet amazing to be so close to an iconic object. Now i will watch for it in movies at home.,
40,Hollywood here I come,Had a great picture taking time standing beneath the writing of the Hollywood sign on the road away from the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Franca442
40,THE mark of Hollywood seen the world over!,You can't get so close to this as you might expect but there are some excellent vantage points from the main strip area particularly the bridge between the different levels on the shopping plaza down from the Dolby Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardaL1371CF
40,A visit to Hollywood,"A must for most travellers to LA and Hollywood Sign.See the Hollywood Centre, Chinese Theatre, and local Film Star's Names on the footpath outside the Centre.Good souvenir stores nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tradebus
50,Great place to hike,"While you can walk to the sign, a better view and walk starts at the Griffith Observatory. You can walk up the hill behind it and see a 360 degree view from downtown LA to mountains, and even the pacific. There are many other trails in the hills that are well worth exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dicksmith24
40,Epic,An absolutely awesome sight to see. Get as close as you can and take lots of pictures. This is something you do not want to miss.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachelrowe14
50,An iconic sign ....worth the trip to take a photo for your album,If you are travelling to Hollywood this is on the must see list.Not because it is is stunning or has much to offer....but it is an Icon ( and of course nice to be able to say you've seen it). The location for your viewing makes all the difference....but a great photo all the same!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lexibrat
50,Hollywood,"Everyone has to have a photo with the Hollywood sign in the back ground, and you can do that from just about everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraceyQLD
50,Good hike,"I parked at the Griffith Observatory and hiked along Mount Hollywood to get to the sign. I didn't make it as close as I wanted to, but it was getting dark and I was a female alone so I decided to turn back... it was a great walk though, and I was able to go off the trail in several places to climb and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynds_x
50,Good Climb,"When you walk up Mount Lee and reach the top of the mountain, you will be directly behind the HOLLYWOOD letters. The walk up is fairly steep, but most anyone can do it. It took us approximately an hour to get to the top, but it was worth it. You can see all over the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britniea2015
40,Free attraction,This sign is best seen from the Hollywood and highland shopping centre. You should go earlier in the day as there tends to be alot more visitors and it could get a bit crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennilicious
40,Great hike to look at one of the most famous tourist attractions!!,"We did not walk all the way up, it was quite hot, and humid and we had small children. However, the trail was nice, and you can choose a couple of different spots to view it from....some of them have longer hikes than the others....but you'll get to see the sign no matter what!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SolveigHansine
40,Saw it,From quite some distance on one of the city tours but it's still a must see when you visit Los Angeles. The iconic sign is still a great photo from anywhere.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JEFFREYG430
50,You have got to go. ...,"You've got to see the Hollywood sign from Mulholland Drive. Besides the drive being thrilling, because you're on the edge of cliff riding on the curves, when you get to the point where you can see the Sun it's incredible. You see that you of LA city like everywhere you seen on TV. You can even see the house that was used in lethal weapon two or three. The one on the stilts, it's right there! And to see the signs from that far away is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovelife2015
50,Just like the photos!!!!,Long time since I was in LA so this was one of the sights that i just had to see again as it is an iconic landmark in LA. Great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Northcotequine2013
40,History of the Movies!,"The history behind the Sign is intriguing if only for the reason it was originally put up there for - an advertising gimmick of a local real estate compsny Hollywood Land. But over the yeas and countless movies it now is part of the Must see brigade when visiting LA. It can be seen from many places across the city and is not well sign posted. I would recommend going to the Getty centre and then having ticked off two places in one hit, you will get a great vantage point to see both.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSA84
50,From the Paramount Lot,"Although the Hollywood Sign can be seen from practically anywhere in Hollywood on a beautiful day, I was especially impressed by my view of the sign during my Paramount Studios Tour. From a specific point on the lot, the Hollywood Sign can be seen at the end of the street in all its glory.",
30,Hollywood sign,"This was part of a full day sightseeing tour of hollywood, but due to health and safety laws you can no longer go to the sign itself they have had people climbing upon it falling getting injured and worse, you do get a good uninterrupted view of the sign would suggest a camera with a telephoto lens to get best photos",
40,Hollywood sign and the craze for it,Hollywood sign is a big craze among the tourists and it is not easy to see it properly unless one ends up taking a tour bus or hikes up the mountain. Even then you cannot go up close as it is a private observatory. I thought the best way to see it through Griffith observatory. This way you end up crossing two checkboxes. And the view from there is fabolous,
30,Hard to find,I know you can see the sign from many places but we blindly traversed the back streets before stumbling upon the Mulholland lookout. Good to do but would be nice to get closer or see it lit at night.,
50,Just like on the movies :),I don't know why I was so impressed with the sign. Must be the million times I have seen it in movies. The nature around it is interesting. Palm trees around the hills. Just beautiful. The sign is definitely my Top 2 out of 5 to see in LA. We drove to the hill area bellow the sign and then walked maybe 0.3 miles up. Took some really nice pictures. The total trip will take you from 1 to maximum 2 hours.,
50,Worth the hike,One of the best things I have done while in LA. Hike up from Beachwood Drive until you get to the fence. Go through the pedestrian archway and then it is about 20-25 minutes to the top.Incredible views over LA.Moderate slopes the whole way. Nothing too bad. Do it early in the morning to beat the heat.the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/messydrone
30,hollywood land,"didn't know about park at top of hill behind sign, be careful of coyotes that roam park, sign is fenced off and patrolled by police .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kroane
40,Needs looking after,The sign is looking a bit tired and needs to be looked after.You can see it from miles around on a clear day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BassettGirlies
20,nothing special,"Nothing special just a big hype because of the US movie business, don't be fooled by actually getting close up via taxi waste of money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ana_Bejan
40,Hollywood sign,"Impressive even when I see it every day. Part tradition, part of the scene. A good landmark so you know where you are. I always get a little rush when I see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26franklins
50,Has to be done!,"Having not realised (duh) or googled to see how to get there (thinking I could drive to the sign), I turned up in flip flops, designer handbag and silky top. After an hour trek in 30¬∫+ heat, over slight hill, dirt tracks and small path (having not kept to the main route), I happily arrived to the fenced off sign (HOLLYWOOD!!!!!).Views there and during the trek were of the LA skyline, beautiful!!!!!!Really, its a good few hours spent even in flip flops and bring a bottle of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brit013
50,It's a sign from above...,"The Hollywood sign to me is like the Las Vegas Sign. It's one of them things you always see periodically throughout life so if given the opportunity to see it in person, I would recommend seeing it! There's nothing magical about the sign per se but I thought it was pretty awesome to see it in person!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZexSwain
50,Great Pictorial Memory!,Hollywood sign is an amazing memory. You definitely want to take a picture of this location and save it for memories .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaymanIslandsFoodie
30,Sign is the sign,It's Hollywood. So the sign becomes a must see. But not so very exciting. It's a must see to take a picture.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/447priyadarshinir
30,Got a good view,Went in a high heat wave so did not walk up but got a good view at the Hollywood and Highland Center. Love the history behind it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hwnew
50,It is what it is!,"It's a sign but unlike any other sign it is the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign. The sign you seen throughout your whole childhood, the sign instantly associated with LA.We did a Roadtrip across the whole of America and this sign marked the end of it for us. We made it, we arrived in Los Angeles. We didn't hike up to it which I am sure would have been fun but we really only wanted to see it in real life and get our picture beside it. Amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jossiepops
50,Iconic!,"Obviously, if you're in LA, you're kind of obligated to take pictures of, or in front of the Hollywood sign. It's a great thing to see if you've never seen it before, and it lets you know that you're not in Kansas anymore (Or in any other state, for that matter)!Try to get close and viewing/pictures is recommended in the daytime, although I've gotten extremely close to the sign at night (Frowned upon by the wealthy hollywood hills inhabitants).It's simply a sign, but a sign that says ""This is LA, California""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhillieEm
30,Iconic Hollywood Sign,"Its iconic, however it can be a challenge to see up close. It requires a little drive through the Hollywood Hills deep into the residential neighborhood and homes of many of the younger celebs in LA. You cannot get up close and personal, legally, due to its location on the hillside and local homes. Many do make the trek up to the sign but beware your NOT suppose too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
30,"Iconic, but hardly exciting","You can see the sign from a distance in various parts of LA, but its tough to get a closer look (you'd have to trespass on private property). It's one of those things that's on everybody's must-see lists because it's famous, but in actuality it's really not that thrilling (it is just a sign after all). A good place to see it is from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelS1689
50,EVEN TEENS WILL ENJOY THIS!,"Take water, snacks, and wear comfy shoes as it's quite a hike uphill, then down. Flip Flops and high heels will leave you in tears. Well worth the detour. Celebrate afterwards in Hollywood at Wayback Burgers or In-N-Out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VolcanoGirl_11
50,LOVE IT,"If you are traveling to california, you will enjoy the hollywood sign. It was one of the best days of my life, just to say I saw it. :)",
50,The Best Moment while vacationing in LA,"Left for the Hollywood mountain climb with my husband and my 28 year old son and 22 year old daughter a little before noon with water and some granola bars. Had no idea what to expect and the kids were quite skeptical if I would be able to do the climb, being very sure that dad would be fine.It would get a bit hard for me so we would stop and take pictures. Then start the climb again and then pause for me to catch some breath and there the photo sessions would start again....It usually takes one and a half hour on an average, but we took 2 and a quarter hour. We enjoyed the climb so much that in fact the breaks which I needed made it more fun. We all turned into little kids pulling each other's legs and absolute child fun. I will treasure those magical moments for the rest of my life.Would have loved to share the pictures, but I don't have them with me right now.It's an absolute must-do if you are in LA. My kids were so proud of me that I managed the climb with a sciatica pain and there was a huge round of applause when we were just below the Hollywood signs clicking all sorts of funny pictures.Just a word of caution if you have tourists ahead of you on horse-backs, wait they go away and are out of your sight. It's not a good idea to be anywhere close behind them since the amount the dust that they kick back is terrible. We were not very close behind, yet landed up with a dust allergy cold, sore throat and fever the next day. But it was still worth it!!!!!",
10,Griffith Park is best,"The city of LA does not have a proper viewing site for the sign, nor the infrastructure to support the tourists who wish to view it. Most risk getting hit by a car (many have been hit) while parking or standing in the street amongst hordes of others. If you venture into neighborhoods, you risk getting your car keyed, towed or blocked in. They've had 3 fires by the sign caused by smoking tourists, so the neighbors feel their lives and homes are at risk. Griffith Park is better. It has parking, bathrooms and space.",
30,Just a place that you can go take a picture and go anywhere else,"I went to this place with a great expectation, but at the end, that is just a place with a sign.take a picture and go do something else.there is a view from a lake or something like that... but it is not a good view.they way to get to this sign is very difficult, always going up, a lot of curves and in some places it pass only one car.better address to take a picture:Canyon lake dr, Los Angeles (Lake Hollywood Overlook).If you type in the GPS Hollywood Sign, it will lead you to a place that you are not allowed to get in.",
50,Beautiful Park,"As iconic as the Hollywood sign is, the real beauty here is hiking thru Griffith park. Make sure to take a water bottle with you since it is a 6.5 mile hike. The grade is steep in only a couple places but it still takes a while to complete. Some of the best views of metro LA from here and the park itself along with the Santa Monica mountains are gorgeous.",
40,Huge,"Hard to get a good close up view of the sign but if you do it is amazing the size of this thing, its huge!",
50,Take a moment to see it.,"Well what is there to say, if your here you have to stop a moment and just look up to see it. History!",
30,"Seen it, done it",I know it's an iconic sign but that is all it is a sign and you can't get close to it. We got a good view from Griffiths Observatory and took our obligatory photo from there.,
30,Essential Hollywood,"I know it's an iconic sign and a big part of Hollywood sightseeing but when looked upon from the vantage point, the sign itself isn't that spectacular. It is just a sign.",
50,If you have a car you have to go there,A tight and twisty road up and a nice wide road down. Finding the sign is not easy so check out google maps first and get the street name in your sat nav and you will find it no problem. You just have to have a photo of the sign and there are some amazing views too.,
20,Long Range view,We were not allowed near the sign and we had to view it from the Observatory about 1/2 mile away.Needed telephoto lens to get anything like a decent photo.Not worth bothering with u less you want tell people you've seen it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArferUk
50,HOLLYWOOD,If Liberty Statue is the most identifiable figure in the east coast. Then The Hollywood Sign is the most famous structure in the west coast. Both of which show what marvelous constructions men can do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
50,I had fun.,I had a great hike up to the sign. Take lots of water with you. I am 210 lbs and 6'1 and a 3 hour hike was 4 bottles of water for me at 104 temp. Rest in shade a bit if you get tired. There are lots of spots to just stop and sit and take in the scenery. Its a beautiful area. If I lived here in would really explore these hills. I really recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zipdip1212
50,Fun hike,Hiked to the top of the sign through the ranch at the bottom. Great views at the top. Bring water - it can get HOT.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylerr493
40,"Clich√©, but have to make the picture",You will need a very good camera ro get a view with yourself in it. Yiu can see the sign from many streets around the sign. Would recommend Hollywood Bowl overlook to have some sense of its history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/becseyz
40,Has to be on your list,I think this is a must do if you are in Los Angeles. The entire world knows the sign and having yourself on the picture with it is just cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigA1999
50,Must see!,Must see this famous landmark in the world. One of the most famous signs in the world. Pity you cannot get close to it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GustavPotgieter
50,Get to see it at least once in my life :),We were able to see the sign from the building beside TLC Chinese Theatre. There are a couple of areas setup for taking pictures of the sign. I recommend a really good zoom lens though as the sign is quite far away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkerstens
40,A must Do in LA,We did the traditional drive through the neighborhood to see the Hollywood Sign. It wasn't a bad drive at all and I guess just one of those things you do when you visit LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbyGilbert
50,Lloyd,A must see if you are visiting los angeles. Me and my girlfriend visited it today and as we had a hire car so we used that instead of wasting money on a tour. Done some research and 3000 canyon lake drive is the highest possible point you can go and it's away from all tourists which is good. Amazing views of the city. Highly reccomend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lloydj743
50,Just what you expect.,"Although a very clich√© thing to do, it was very fun to get our picture in this iconic spot. The drive is fun as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehippoguy
40,Hollywood Sign,The sign is actually quite far away. You need a good camera to get a decent picture.Just stopped to get the customary tourist photo.You can't walk right beside the sign as it's in a protected park (so we were told)Worth the trip though,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quabba1
50,Ya Just Gotta See It!,This was on my bucket list! We got off the highway and there it was! We still went to the observatory to see it but it was just so breathtaking to see it from street level!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/its5oclocksumwhere
30,its just a sign!,"You are never really close enough to get a good photo of this! If its part of your tour, fine, but don't make a special trip just to see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaarenw2015
50,do it,yep its there in all its glory! you can't get to it (well you can if you want to scale a fence) but you can get close enough at dedicated viewpoints for a good photo. decent view over LA from here too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/courtneyw686
40,Visions of the filmstars of years gone by,"The history of this sign is really interesting and seeing it in real life rather than just the films is pretty awesome! At the end of the day it is just a sign, but the appearance of it and the history makes it more than that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petti120
40,"Great to see, but don't expect to get right up to the letters","Great to see - but don't expect to get right up to the letters. The trade off however, is that there are some great houses that hyou will see on the way up. The best roads to view from are up around the observatory (about a 5 min drive from). A cliche must-do :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt-Rogaloff
40,A must see location!,"We were in the Hollywood area and felt we just couldn't leave without seeing the Hollywood sign. We drove to Hollywood Blvd, parked and walked up to an area where you can see the sign from a distance. There is a platform so you can get a very good view of the sign and take some photos. Even though you're a distance from the actual sign, there's a lot of buzz and excitement from all the tourists getting photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgtg23
50,Classic hike to see an icon,This was a great adventure that combined some physical exercise with getting close to what is a world renowned icon. Would definitely recommend the 45 minutes it takes to get to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyp761
50,Hollywood!,"Getting up close and personal was/is definitely on the bucket list. It is quite a hike, but so worth it. Great exercise, great views and great bragging rights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luswei
30,Just a sign really,Fine to see from far away and take a few photos. Not worth going close to as far as I'm concerned. You can get good views of it from lots of places in LA.,
40,Bucket List *check*,"This was a sight that checked off a bucket list item. Very busy, and crowded and semi hard to take a picture with everyone around but it was good. Once you take one you're done.",
30,Nothing great,Alright. Nothing too special - famous due to movies I suppose. Lot of folks who come by to take pictures near / next to it.,
20,Its a sign - get over it,"Went to Hollywood (again) and saw the big white plywood sign (again) - very big, very white, gorgeous.Did think about getting closer as figured it would look even bigger but probably no whiter.Saw many other signs during the visit - most were smaller and less white.",
40,Enjoyed Getting As Close As We Could To The Sign,"While driving aroung this area one day I decided to follow my nose and try and get as close as I could to the Hollywood sign. My GPS wasn't much help as it took me miles up a road that eventually turned into a 'closed road' So finally with twists and turns I got as close to the sign that was legally possible. Do not try and climb the hill to get closer- there are security guards at the top, who have loud speakers if you dare try and try to warn you off and if you heed their warnings, the police helicopter will soon be deployed and come swooping overhead as it did the day we were there. There locals must get tired of the constant cruising of cars trying to negotiate their way around hairpin bends on what we call the wrong side of the road. But really, I don't think a local could expect anything less when you are living in the shadows of something so iconic in LA- in the world really. I couldn't tell you the street name to get you there because it was a complete blind adventure, but I had fun and got some awesome photos.",
50,A must see,"At long last, we finally saw the Hollywood sign..amazing to say the least. .a must see.The hills were breathtakingly beautiful, and the Hollywood sign is nestled in the mountains. .gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdenhen
50,Amazing,It was amazing to look at probably the most famous sign in the world. It dominates the hill above Los Angeles. You can see it from many places when you move around LA and take pictures. It's well visible from the walk of fame as well. Amazingüëçüëç,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giuseppecincin
50,Best Secret View of Hollywood Sign!,"The Hollywood Sign is a landmark and everyone who comes to Hollywood should get a good look at it. Here is the ticket, go up to LAKE HOLLYWOOD, you can find it on Google Maps. It is off of Barham off the 101 north. You can get there by going North on Highland, get on 101 for one exit, get off at Barham and go right see Google Maps for detailed directions.Ok so it is this big reservoir that is like a park and lots of local people walk around it for exercise BUT there is THE BEST close up view of the Hollywood Sign EVER about a mile around the lake. There is a parking lot and no hassle. Mind you this is like a 2 or so mile walk around this lake to get to the best view spots, but you will have the chance to get some awesome relatively close-up pix of the sign or of yourself with the sign in the background that you can't get anywhere else. There is no food or water here and its a kind of long walk around the lake, so wear comfortable shoes and bring water and a bag for your own trash because there are no trash cans. It is a flat walk on concrete so you don't need hiking boots but if you're up for a little exercise, you won't be sorry and the pix you get will be awesome. You will not get this kind of gorgeous view of the sign on the mountain across water from a stuffy crowded tour bus. Lake Hollywood is where the locals go to walk and a pretty well kept secret for Hollywood Sign viewing. Google Lake Hollywood to make sure its open at the time and day you want to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollywoodLexx
20,Not a big deal,Yeap!!! Don't wait a huge sign that will really affects you!!! It is just a sign...u can understand how marketing of cities are important for tourism. The only good thing about seeing this sign is one more step in your to do list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekinoza
20,I don't get it,There are a lot of landmarks in the world that make you feel something when you see them. You see the Eiffel Tower and it feels like you just met the president. You see the Colosseum and you feel like you time-traveled. You see the Hollywood sign and you feel like you're looking through smog at a bunch of plywood up on a hill. Because you're looking through smog at a bunch of plywood up on a hill. I'm pretty shocked this place has such high review scores.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KevinN769
30,Just a sign,In my opinion it is nothing special just a sign on a hill that would only be suitable for billy goats as the surrounding area is a wasteland with very little vegetation to speak of. not to say it is not worthy of a visit for its historical value just don't expect too much and you will be fine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7748UXscottb
40,The best place to see the sign is...,The best place to see the sign if from the observatory parking lot at Griffith Park. There are many spots that will yield great photos though parking is sometimes a bit difficult. It's worth it though. And the Observatory is very interesting as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filmtex
50,I don't know what it is....,There's just something about this very famous sign. We went to a Griffin park to get a great shot of the sign and see a very popular spot to shoot movies.You can't go home if you don't take the picture so do it from the best vantage point you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
50,Eponymous symbol of Hollywood,"This is an eponymous symbol of Hollywood, get up close and personal with the sign. Park down below and take a photo with it in the background, or hold it up with your hand and you will look huge. When I saw it last it was white-washed and it looked clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longwayfromtexas
50,I caught might view of the sign from somewhere around the Kodak Theater,"As I'm an East Coast girl, my dream like most preteens and teens was to one day see the Hollywood sign. Cross another item off my bucket list! I must admit that it did not look as tall as I had expected, but still it was magical to see it and to be able to photograph it. What some may not know is that initially the sign was not ""Hollywood"" but rather ""Hollywoodland"" as that was the original name of Hollywood and if memory serves me correctly, Hollywoodland derived it's name from a tree or bush that grew in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltoforeignlands
40,Major tourist attraction,We hiked up the hill to the Griffith Observatory to see this famous landmark. Really great to see such a famous landmark. Too bad the cell tower has to be right there ........,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417kks
30,Good to see live,I've seen it so many times in movies and on TV so it was nice to see it live from Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood & Highland complex. I only wish that I could have seen it from a closer viewpoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742artf
30,Not as awesome as I would have imagined,I have always wanted to see the Hollywood sign and finally got the chance to today. It was good to see to knock it off my bucket list but nothing more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordansbulls
50,Avoid Arrest!,"Cops and Park Rangers patrol the immediate sign area 24/7, so be careful about getting too close! It is illegal! The terrain is no picnic either! Here are a few legal places I have found work after spending three years living on Argyle Street while in Grad School at UCLA. The view from Griffith Park observatory is adequate, but off centre a bit. Next, the view if you go up Gower is OK, but a bit too far away. Better still is the view from upper floors of the Hollywood & Highland Mall, and finally the best view (though complicated to get to) is from the 3200 block on Canyon Lake Drive - you get really close and the letters are square-on in your photos. You won't get arrested or told to get lost at any of these viewing spots! Be respectful of private property. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
40,We saw the Sign,"I can now say I have seen the sign in person! We didn't get to hike up to it, the trails were closed the day we went but there was some pull off places you can get out and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brinastew
30,A must see if you're from out of town!!,"I work in Hollywood and drive up Gower every night and there it is at the top if the street! It's so iconic,makes me a little nostalgic for old Hollywood. Super cool to see, but you cant get to it, so dont even try! The neighbors on Beachwood don't like tourists, so stay on Gower for some good pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaydeef2015
40,Cool for a Photo,"This is the Hollywood sign. If you're not from LA it's a tourist must see/photo op. Whilst you can see it from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it is really too far away for your camera to pick it up. We got our best shots from the Griffith Observatory, which has great views from the right side of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/873AmyB873
40,What's in a sign,"We did drive up to a good place to make a picture of this world famous icon. If you google ""where take picture of Hollywood sign"" you will find the same address as I did. The drive up was via small residential streets up in the hills above Hollywood but it brought us to a place where a multiple tourists were taking a beautiful picture of the sign and of the LA skyline far away. On the way back the Garmin took us via wider but still residential streets. We did see the sign a lot earlier but when we took pictures from too far the letters were very hard to read. The sign is in the end just a sign but the journey to get there was fun and the fact that you get a scenic ride up in the Hollywood hills made it a good experience for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DdeKerf
40,The sign to look out for when you are in Hollywood !,"We first got the glimpse of this sign when we were walking on Hollywood Boulevard. Next time we could see it better when we took a scenic drive through Mulholland drive on Hollywood Hills area. This was a much better view. Apparently the sign originally was called Hollywood Land. But then the ""Land"" part actually collapsed due to a land slide! Since then it is only Holywood !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chatsuparna
30,Hollywood sign,if you want to get a good photo of the sign it is best to drive up there . Hard to get a perfect pic from near Hollywood walk of fame,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poppym548
30,Its a sign,"You can hike up to the fence line that surrounds it, other than that its the HOLLYWOOD sign. I guess its neat if your a tourist?",
40,A true icon,The sign is visible from a range of places all over Hollywood. A really good spot is by Griffith's observatory as this overlooks the sign.,
40,Great to see,The best place to view the Hollywood sign and get great pictures is from the 1st floor outside Dave and Buster 's at Hollywood & Highland Mall.,
30,Very windy road,Very windy road to get to the sign...absolutely full of tourist buses as expected.Lake Hollywood on the opposite side of the side is stunning to view from the Hollywood sign point.Hear about the very famous house as you make your journey to the side,
40,Too far to see,It is high on the mountain and a bit far away to take picture or see it clearly. The studio however is worthy visiting.,
50,Hollywood Hollywood where can I see you from,"Well let me be the first one to tell you I can see the Hollywood sign from a second floor from Beverly hills building, I can see the sign from South Central , I can see the sign from Chinese theater and I can see the sign from Hollywood Blvd. So now you tell me where you can see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neicey217

30,Good for a hike,"Definitely not like in the movies. But it's a beautiful mountain and has a trail for hiking. You can park close to the sign, but cannot go and touch it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seyyed4li
40,Enjoyed,I have enjoyed this place. Gorgeous atmosphereSuperb crowd always. So many people socially kids are playing and how they are enjoying this place I am so happy to see that. I was spent a half day over there and got a lot of memory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/admsn
50,Can't go to LA and not see it!!,An iconic site with cameras flashing for photos in front of iconic sign. Also nearby is one of Madonna's houses. This is a must see site for you Los Angeles trip. Locals are a bit perturbed by all the site-seers but tourism is the key to this landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beachpicasso
30,Nothing special,A normal sign ... nothing special about it .... but you can't visit LA without seeing it ... we saw it from very far but you cannot come so close,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guilhermec433
30,Nothing special,"I was really surprised when I saw it. It is so far so you can hardly see it. Moreover, I can't see it from everywhere, only in particular places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/467ekaterinas
50,Take the road less traveled by hiking to the backside of the Hollywood Sign.,"This activity is free and there aren't many of those around LA. Hiking to the backside of the Hollywood sign was an amazing experience. My son and I parked near the horse stables on Mt. Lee where hikers will find the trail entrance. The trail consists of many switch-backs and no signs mark the trail to get to the top. Just use your instinct and ask fellow hikers on the trail if you are heading in the correct direction. It is an unbelievable site once you get to the top. The trail takes hikers higher than the sign itself. I highly recommend the trek because it really cool when the Hollywood sign is featured in movies and you can say to your fellow travelers, ""remember when we hiked there"". I recommend for adults and for those with older children that can make the hike. I have a teenage son and he loves activities like this versus sitting on a beach or visiting a museum. Very, very cool as not many people have visited the backside of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jersey0427
50,Have to see when you're in LA!,There are lots of different viewpoints to see the Hollywood sign. We saw it firstly through the arches at Hollywood and Highland and then again at The Griffith Observatory. It's a must see to get your picture with the Hollywood sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62
50,Viva Las Vegas!,"Our experience as a family in Vegas was awesome. Not to mention finally at the Vegas sign. For me , it was quite an experience since i work as part of the Tourism in General Santos City, Philippines. It somehow something we can emulate with regards to the Las Vegas sign welcoming all the Tourist of the city. . Something to be done to our City... Sooon.. The Tuna Capital of the Philippines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384davea
50,Amazing feeling,"Being up close to this sign gives you an amazing feeling of being immersed in the land of movies and television. Having seen it so many times on TV, it's even more incredible in person!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brent_N_Hunter
50,Must see,you can't get too close but the view is gorgeous. An iconic view that was worth the hot sun to see it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCBrock
40,it gives you a good feeling when you see it,"if you want to see the sign from a close area you should walk for 30minutes, you can never take a nice photo with the sign except if you walk this 30 min.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianK_13
50,Great Viewpoint,"There are lots of places and vantage points from where the iconic ""Hollywood"" sign can be seen. Lake Hollywood Park at Los Angeles, CA 90068 is a low key local park with on street parking and a great view of the sign. Its up a fairly winding set of suburban roads but any GPS/Google map will show how to get there, probably easiest to take Tahoe Dr on to Canyon Lake Dr. There are hiking trials nearby but strolling into the park you get an pleasant and unobstructed view of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasmineguard
50,It may be overrated but who else has one?,"This is an icon and is well loved by angelenos and tourists alike. Every now and then people climb up and change the sign with duct tape , example........ Bollywood, and Ollywood *( Iran contra hearings.) and other funnies. Sadly some disillusioned people have jumped from it. but mainly it has been seen in many,many movies. See the horse ride to right below the Hollywood sign noted here on trip advisor. This is a must do if you ride and an fun experience experience. You can look up a blvd and face it right on from (another) celebrity cemetary on Santa Monica Blvd ( east of West hollywood.). It was erected as a realtots advertisement in the 1930's, and has been seen the world over in many many movies. do not feel bad if you could not find a way to get close. Due to vandalism and a few disilusioned jumpers, the way up has been made difficult. You can see it from Griffith Observatory + take pics with a zoom lens. There is also a horse ride posted here on TripAdvisor, that goes very close to the sign with all the permissions required. Enjoy it and share with your friends back homes.They will be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk
50,A must see,If you can grab a ride on a helicopter its even more exciting! If you are into walking. The trails are incredible (bring water bottles). Spectacular!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieM5
20,Totally avoidable!,We were tempted to opt for this tour based on tourism brochures but this turned out to be a big disappointment. Not worth at all!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98neerajs
50,Beautiful !,"Try to go in the morning or late in the afternoon, this is to avoid the heavy crowds during the day. Take some water and walking shoes. Remember ! Go early because after living in the area since 1980 i've watched the neighborhood go from a Sleepy, Beautiful, Quite & Mellow place to a Total Zoo during the day !But..Hey it's All Good & Still Amazing Beautiful and Everyone is Welcome !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanomuellerstudio
50,So much better up close...,We had a great morning here. With a map / satnav you can find some quiet residential streets around Lake Hollywood Drive where you can park. (Please respect the residents though..) Then a great walk that goes pretty close to the sign along an easy track with cool cacti.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160philr
40,Bake it In,"You really should take a moment to admire the famous sign, but you do not need to do backflips to do it. It is rather easy to see the sign from many places in the area. Just keep your eyes open so you can stop when you see it. It is not a destination, and parking in Hollywood is not fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTravelerRadio
50,nice view,hello ppl I went there with my wife we felt like we had a mission to do ... going there form our hotel in Inglewood .. we made it but it was kind of dark .. it gets kid of scary for ladies,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmny
40,Touristy but a must,A nice walk after a winding drive. Lots of tourists around but the view alone was great so it was still worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemL308NL
50,Photographing the sign,"This was a fun day outing. Besides taking photos of the sign, there is a lake and greet views of Los Angeles. Wear good shoes because you can do some walking to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxtrasafe
30,"All show... little ""blow""...don't go","In the fifties I can recall seeing this sign reading ""HOLLYWOODLAND"". It was put up by a real estate company promoting a real estate development. Have no idea what happened with the project but the sign was later edited to Hollywood and so was born an iconic sign. Actually the view if far superior from any hill miles away. To get to the sign you must travel through a non descript Hollywood residential area. There is little parking, nothing to do and you will be a real nuisance to the neighborhood residents who despise the sign. Go to one of the fabulous Los Angles Museums. You will leave far more satisfied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nomadralph
30,Better seen afar than up close,"Second time in LA and the facination wears of quickly. This time we took a tour that took us nearer to the letters. It was just that: letters. It is an icon of the city of course, but other than that, it's best seen from a distance or in pictures. If you enjoy hiking, you'd probably enjoy the mountain more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AriaM61
20,Leave the people in this neighborhood alone!,"I used to have a horse stabled at the ranch at the end of Beachwood canyon... The main route to views of the Hollywood Sign. I have seen this neighborhood go from quietly peaceful to looking like Times Square as hordes of people's GPS guide them to this neighborhood. If you really desire a view of this symbol of Hollywood( not really all that thrilling in my opinion) then book a trail ride at the Sunset Ranch and have a peaceful ride in Griffith Park with plenty of the best views of the sign. Only people who have a reservation at the ranch can get through the gate with their cars and park in a special lot. Otherwise, especially on weekends, when parking near the sign is restricted to quite a ways down the hill, you will find this a long, hot hike, especially with little kids. Please consider giving the people in this neighborhood a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sallylilies
10,Not worth it,"The Hollywood Sign is fun to look at, but making a pilgrimage out of going to see it is just not worth it. The Hollywood Sign is visible from numerous locations all over Los Angeles that are much more worth the hike. You can get both a view of the sign and a trip to a great location. For instance, the Griffith Park Observatory is one of the best things ever! And you can see the Hollywood Sign from there! And for spectacularly beautiful hiking in LA, try the San Gabriel Mountains or Malibu or the Pacific Palisades or the Santa Monica Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flummywister
40,Great Hike,Nice hike. You get close to sign. Parked near the Griffith observatory. We hiked to the top of Mount Hollywood. Nice view but very exposed hike. Lots of people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_IBMER
40,The icon that is.....,"Walk a block from Manns Theatre to the shopping complex where there are two bridges that you get the best view from - Bear in mind, it's a bit away !!

40,Not to Miss - if you are there!,If you are in the area you can't not go and see the Hollywood sign. For all the family it was worth just to stand and look at what you see on TV all the time. Plenty of gift shops nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snuggs99
40,"Nice, but...","We got some decent views of the Hollywood sign from Hollywood Blvd and again while on a Starline Tour. However my girlfriend did the 3 mile hike up to the sign from the area around the Griffin Observatory and it sounds like the driving version doesn't compare. She was able to get some great pictures from atop the sign with superb views of the city and the valley. My recommendation is to do both but if you have the legs for a little hike, you'll be rewarded far more than any of the driving options will allow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HankW80

30,Not easy to get a great viewing point but we found one,After many different attempts we have finally found a great view point. If you head towards sunset ranch and walk up the hill by their gate on the trail you get a great view. Combine it with a horse back ride for a different view.Take water and few bags its steep and hot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joep735

40,Go to a good viewing point...,Cool to say you have seen it.. we went up to the Griffith observatory to see the sign! it was quite bust and maybe a little too far away. Not as good as this picture from TA :) There must be better viewing points I'm sure.,
50,A fun hike or horseback ride up!!,"Another family must do, great walk with many people participating, all ages!! Clear sunny, hot, but the constant breeze made to heat tolerable..... Highly recommend!",
40,"Nice to see, but..","I think everybody who's visiting hollywood wants te see the signs, right? So did we, and we do have a few tips for you!First of all, drive toward the sunset ranch in Hollywood. Park your car along the sidewalk, and keep in mind, DO NOT GO THERE ON A WEEKEND, becuse there will be no way to park your car there! So, just the weekdays.Then, hike up the mountain! Bring water, it is a moderate hike, to say the least!And watch it, there are NO direction signs, but TAKE THE SWITCHBACK UP! Don't make the same mistake to turn right, away from the mountain, or you be faced with an extra 45 min.hike!Once there, the view is great! Be sure to visit the backside of the letters!",
30,Overated,"We payed a lot of money I order to take the tour of the city and visit the sign and the result was not that good! The best pictures I had were them from my hotel! It is just a sign ( old one to be accurate) that it is so familiar to us through the movies, nothing more than that!",
40,Nice view from lake Hollywood park,"I was so excited to see this sign, the closer I got to it, the more I felt like I was seeing something iconic. I basically followed other reviewers advice and put lake Hollywood park in my iPhone maps and had no problem finding it. You can look for parking legally as high up the hill as you can (don't stop at the dog park, keep going up), take a few pics and that's it (unless you plan to hike). Seeing the beautiful homes on the way up was a plus too. Traffic on the freeway getting there sucked thou. But all my pics came out really nice, so it was worth it.",
30,Hard to see,It's not easy to find a place to easily see the sign but we felt like we needed to see it since we were there. One of the tour busses took us up to an overlook to get pictures but it was still pretty far away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinlbr
40,Great day driving,"very cool, we didnt do the tour.. just drove up for a look but still a thrill to see. Be aware if you are driving up without a tour there are alot of steep one way streets so be prepared to do alot of 3 point turns when you reach a house at a dead end. Still a fun day Driving around and visiting Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/430juliat
50,It was Excellent,I've had a lot of fun seeing the Hollywood sign with my family. It was stunning to see it in real life and out of the movies. üëçüèø,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/909omark
40,HOLLYWOOD!,"The trail behind the HOLLYWOOD sign is steep, and one has to be careful. However, it is worth the view and the actual visit to the HOLLYWOOD sign. Something different and a bit of history. Excellent for picture taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleElyseLesser
40,The real and the imitation,"We saw the famous Hollywood sign ligning up with our street during a bicycle tour organised by Bikes and Hikes. We also saw, much better, an imitation of the sign close to our Sheraton Universal hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
30,Hooray for Hollywood,"Nice drive through the hills trying to get to the sign, locals pleasant enough despite being slowwed up by visitors trying to get a photo!! Love the ambience of the roads and properties here, I'd live here. Probably have a better photo opportunity from Sunset Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barca92red
40,very near view...,i was lucky to be almost at the foot of the mountain here the sign is. It's just a sign but the significance of the sign is what what makes it special. Go see it on what ever vantage you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
50,Great Time.,Thank you TripAdvisor friends. Your tips led us to the best view of the sign!! It was fun driving through the hills of Hollywood. We didn't have to hike and didn't want to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveOahu09
30,Just a sign,No big deal.. It kinda in the middle of a neighborhood so it's a pain.. Narrow streets and lots of traffic.. Not a must do!Put it on the back burner..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cavjock
50,The drive through the hills was awesome!,"We were able to get really close to the sign using the address we found on this website: http://www.pachd.com/free-images/hollywood-sign.html. Driving through the neighborhoods in the hills (instead of coming back the way we came, we continued up the hill and set the GPS to take us down to Hollowood Blvd) was a delight. The roads are very narrow at some points, so you'd have to be very careful though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Obiora
30,It's just a sign...but worth a look,"It's a world famous icon, so it's worth a look...but it's just a sign. Take photos from different angles and then move on. There's more exciting things to see here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatyHol
50,Hike from the West,"My wife and I recently hiked up to the Hollywood Sign from the west and it was amazing. Be warned the trail from the west is considered the toughest trail to get there but the shortest.The trail starts with a short hike thru a private neighborhood and then up the a mountain that overlooks universal city and a reservoir. At the top of the mountain is a tree know as the wisdom tree. Underneath it is a chest that has hundreds of notebooks with people's messages from others from over 20 years back. Be sure to leave a message for other to read. Once you leave there you walk the ridge of the mountain for a few miles and approach the sign from the back side and come up to Hugh Hefner overlook. The trial is challenging in areas but that's part of the funIf you want the easy way then walk from Griffith park, but if you want something that makes you feel like you accomplished something by getting there take then west trail. Be sure to take water. No water at top and it gets hot. We took ten bottles in a backpack and thy were all gone before reaching the bottom",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warhawk0002
50,And there it is!!,"The sign that is so famous I bet they know about in space. Can be seen from just about anywhere in LA. Big white letters. Great reference point. Great to see it in the flesh. If you can get there, do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOPPROFILE
40,Get as Close as You Can,"I did this hike with my daughter on a hot day. Definitely glad I brought a bottle of water with me! The climb was not that easy, but the views are outstanding. You can't actually get close enough to touch the sign, but you can get close enough to enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garnetngolden76
20,Overrated... To fare away,"Wast of time.. We went up to viewpoint 2 (observatory), but had to walk from the first parking lot with a bad knee in at heat (100F). What did we see, a sign many, many miles away. I don't see the point in the staff couldn't let med pass, egen she could see i was having a donjoy on my knee... Poor service...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMJ-DK
40,Hollywood sign,It is hard to get to. We were told by our tour guide in 2007 that people are not allowed to get too close to the sign because of the people who jumped off the sign in the past. My tour bus drove through a residential neighborhood to get close to the sign. I also got a view of it from the patio at the California Pizza Kitchen which is located inside the mall that is located behind the Chinese theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/516vanessan
50,Fantastic hike to the Hollywood Sign,"We are a family of 4 (parents and two teens) - everyone loved this hike. We took the 6.5 mile Canyon Blvd hike, which takes in the Batman cave from the 60s show. There is a link from the official Hollywood Sign website which gives great directions. On this route we hiked up to behind the sign (I think this is as close as you can get) - the views over LA are amazing. We then took the trail round to the front of the sign - it is such an iconic sight it is pretty breathtaking when you get your first view from up close. The whole hike took 3 hours. You need plenty of water and sun cream. A snack is also good - there is nowhere to get anything and walking to the top gives you an appetite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianeb454
50,Hollywood Sign - A must,"I think a visit to Los Angeles is not complete without a photograph taken all the ""HOLLYWOOD"" sign as the background. The climb to the park near to the sign itself is an experience, as the road is narrow with lot of turns and twists. As is the case elsewhere in Los Angeles, car parking is a problem here too. But if you are with a tour operator, you don't have to worry about parking.. A must visit place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanghatr
50,Iconic sign.,This is an iconic sign. If it is a clear day you get to see it perched high up on the hill. A visual reminder of where you are.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCantrill13
40,Famous LA icon,"The sign is a very famous LA icon, but other than taking its picture there's very little to do next to it... One of the best photo spots is from Mulholland Hwy, which requires driving through Hollywood's narrow and steep roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avipiti
40,Iconic,"It‚Äôs not the most fun thing to do when you come to Hollywood but it‚Äôs certainly a must do. It‚Äôs worth all the photos you can get and make your friends envious. Don‚Äôt take a tour. It‚Äôs expensive and not worth it. If you have a car, just drive up as close as you can to a lookout point. You‚Äôll enjoy the views of the city and it‚Äôs truly a sight. It made my wife‚Äôs day so it was well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,A Superstar Experience,"The moment my eyes saw the HOLLYWOOD sign I was mesmerized. I took tons of pictures and just stared and stared at that sign for almost an hour.Hollywood, California is so entertaining and fun‚Ä¶don't miss out on the HOLLYWOOD SIGN.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adrianna24sings
20,Not lit at night!,"You can get there directly or watch it from the shopping centre on the Hollywood Boulevard but don't wait for the night!!! (just like we did) It is not lit at night ;) So you might leave LA without a single photo of the famous sign, just like we did :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dominika81
50,Great Views for Your Eyes,The sign is impressive to see up close (Best View location). The views of the towns below are refreshing to see fore people like me that are from the flat plains of the Midwest.Please use common sense when visiting the Best View location (see Google for the Best View location). People live right by the sign and would prefer that you leave your drones/quad copters at home. Please be respectful to those who lived here by not flying or landing video recording devices on their property.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blackhawks2013
30,Something you just have to do when in Hollywood.,"We drove up to the park below the hill on which the sign is situated and took photos from there. Parking can be a problem but be patient, someone is leaving all the time, you will get one eventually. You can hike up to the sign- our teens weren't interested so we had to leave that off our to do list, but I'do have liked to get up there. It's a 5 hour hike they say but looks like about 1-2 hours straight up to me, so maybe it's 5 hrs for the unfit? Don't know, but when our teens heard 5 hours they refused point blank!! Though we took pics in the park, you'd get better pics if you walk up the road and higher to take pics, we only saw the better vantage point when we drove further up and around but since there is no parking anywhere along where the best photos could be had we settled for the ones we'd already taken from the park. Nothing up there besides fancy houses , the park and the sign. Worth a trip but take snacks and drinks with you if you want to spend time, you can't get anything once you're up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SA_Girl2014
30,Something to see while driving by if you're passing by Hollywood,I have 3 children from age 10 to 19 and we're from Atlanta so we knew once a lifetime for them to see this big sign that you see in the movies all the time would be a big deal to our children. So we made the efforts to take them there to have the pictures made to prove to others what we saw it. I could care less....Hollywood was my least favorite from my SF to SD trip. At least we could say we did VISITED that place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deafsro73
40,Nice part of film history,We saw it from the observatory and Walk of fame. It is rather small then u would think but a good site to see in a huge city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arunu2015
40,Hollywood Sign,"Once you see the sign, you realise you can see it from almost everywhere, but getting a good picture of it with you by it is really difficult. We were staying in North Hollywood and it wasn't too far from our hotel. We went for a walk up towards it, saw a chipmunk, heard a rattle snake and decided it was time to get back down the hill. Fun to see and take pictures of it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TLSE2
40,Nice to see,"so many people were there, we couldn't even park - I got out to snap a photo while hubby circled around... they were even stopping people going up as we were driving down - next time we will stay awhile and hike up to get a closer look... definitely something to see when/if you are in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherry3578
40,Hollywood..,"There are so many places in Hollywood where you can see the Hollywood Sign‚Ä¶ So many in fact that everyone has their own favourite. We were told that apparently you can once again hike all the way to the back of the Hollywood Sign now that they have reopened it to the public however we didn't find it necessary to. We simply went to a local look out with ""We love LA Tours"" and were given the history of the sign and shown the beautiful LA Valley below.Recommend using them to guide you around LA as they give you a luxurious view of the city with the comfort of being chauffeured around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386nikb

10,BORING!,"Who cares! It's old and decrepit and hard to get to. But if you find it is a must for you to do, know the road is very winding to get to the sign. Take your picture from a distance because it is not impressive when you get to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas
30,Hollywood sign,"Got a view of the sign from the open air mall next to dolby theatre on hollywood blvd.The view was pretty good from the bridge at the mall.The sign is not lit up at night, and is not that nice up close.You could get closer if you drive, it is quite far so this is the best spot to view it from afar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonasj386
40,How close can you get?,"There are lots of places to see the Hollywood sign, but I wanted to try and get as close as possible. I think you can trek up behind it, but wasn't feeling that energetic, so I did some prep with Google maps and found a couple of places. The obvious place is Lake Hollywood Park on Lake Canyon Drive and from there you can park and walk up the road to get closer. If you carry on in that direction by car, there is a closer viewing angle above the houses and through the trees by the junction of Durand Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sdwoo
50,Visiting the Hollywood sign,"Awesome experience! Just follow your GPS through the neighborhoods and once you get close you will see a sign that says ""sight seeing"" in so and so miles and that will take you to a spot where you can park and take pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyandstephaniee

The best point to see is Griffith Observatory but there is some tours that goes closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726lub
30,Now I've seen it,"I'm not a huge movie star fan, but I did want to ""see"" the sign while in LA. Since other reviews warned of wasting time going up to see the sign. We admired it from afar - and that was good enough for me.",
40,You gotta go,"It's a potentially hot hike, but get to the top and you have free air conditioning with a cool breeze at the top and a wonderful 360 degree view. About a four mile round trip and worth it!",
40,The perfect spot to see the Hollywood sign,"We found a spot on Google Maps named ""Hollywood Sign Great View"" on Canyon Lake Drive. Easy to find from the 101, not crowded at all, and a good view of both sign and LA scenic view.",
50,Snap a photo!,"Yes, everyone needs a photo of this world famous sign. There are some hikes into the area and that is a great thing to do. Wonderful views.",
20,not so great,"Very bad sign, the hill road is pathetic. the famous hollywood sign so infamous. just view the sign from distance. please dont go close. you will be dissappointed",
50,Hollywoooooooooood!,No trip to LA would be complete without a trip to see the HOLLYWOOD sign. Not as easy to find as you might imagine but was quite nice driving through some pretty amazing roads and looking at some amazing houses!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Migelh66
30,Hollyweed,"Sign on the hill, not lit. It was the view from our hotel room. Went on a tour, they said you can no longer go to the sign, as pranksters used sheets to have the sign say things like hollyweed etc. Kinda funny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clemsun

50,"Hike to the Sign, Amazing View!","Apparently none of these other reviewers even went up to this iconic monument, they stopped and took photos from over 1 mile away at a crowded dog park! Look up the directions and chose the hike that best suits you. If you go from the Griffith Observatory it's easier but a little longer. Get some exercise and enjoy the amaizing views of the entire LA area all the way to the beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CareyG555
40,no big deal,so we expected way more than we got ... the sign is in the ugliest part of Hollywood ... and it is just there ... no big deal ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FortunataR_13
50,your own eyes cause chills,something about opening your hotel room and seeing the sign or walking down a street and looking up or better yet turning down a street and seeing palm trees and the sign setup center in the street. it brings chills to the skin when you see it with your own eyes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankmN7379BJ
50,Hollywood Dog Park - Best Photo spot!,Glad I did my research to find the Hollywood dog park! The photos there were the best and allows you to get a nice close up on the sign with you in the picture. Be weary of the police though as they were ticketing people for parking (I think for parking on the wrong side of the road) but you can survive for a few minutes to snap a few pics since there is plenty of spots.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaptainHusker
40,right out of the movies,To see the sign close up after seeing it for years in movies etc. was exhiliarating. It is huge .We visited the area above the sign and spent maybe 90 minutes there. You will need a rental car or take a city tour to reach the area. There is so much to do in the area that it could take days to see everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/218karleenk
40,It's just a sign but...,Yes it is just a sign but it symbolizes so much more so this is a must see. We drove to the Griffith Observatory and were greatly disappointed at the view from there. We hopped in the car and decided to drive towards the sign and see if we could get a better view. Sure enough we ended up by Canyon Lake and Muholland. There is a parking area there where you can walk towards the sign. We took some cool pics and were done. Totally worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NRod6
50,Looking for that iconic picture,You can drive up the road to get close to the sign but the road is very tight and straight uphill. You can get a better view down on the streets and you could argue a better picture. There are hiking trails but plan on spending the day as it's a long hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaP230
40,Great photo opportunities,"C'mon guys, it's just a sign. Get your selfie stick out and snap away. No visit to LA is complete without a pic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biggweilo
40,The Hollywood Sign!,"We've all seen it on TV, in the media, or at least heard of it, and here it is!

We loved actually seeing it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashlenclaireee
40,"Yes, it's the sign!","We've seen it in the media for years, and I must admit it was a buzz to see it an person and take the all too obvious pictures. Just a bit of fun, nothing astonishing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanGeelong1
50,Give it Up to the Uber Driver,The sign brings back the thoughts of an era when movie stars ruled Hollywood. We had a fantastic Uber driver who would not give up until my daughter and I were at a place where we could get a good pic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MS3434
30,Good to tick off list but not accessible close by.,We saw the sign & had the photos taken at the Griffith observation conservatory up on the hill- which is worth a visit. The sign is not straight on from here but the tour guide pointed the best vantage point for the photo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/478meredithr
40,Nearest Place to Hollywood Sign,"Nearest place to Hollywood Sign is at 3204 Canyon Lake Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90068, USA.

50,Level with the sign,We were with a resident who drove us up into the Hollywood Hills until we were level with the sign -- what a grand view. The streets are rather narrow and twisty so don't try this with a large vehicle -- lots of places are only one way traffic because of cars parked on the streets. There were a number of interesting houses/estates along the way to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3638GRpatricial
30,A must see for a FIRST time tourist,"You can take a tour halfway up. Better to take the time an hike up there. You can see the sign from Hollywood Boulevard, Not really worth the drive up there as you really do not get any closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPL0626

Franklin Av and Beechwood Dr -about 3 blocks N of Hollywood Blvd. Drive 1.7 mi N towards Hollywood sign on Beechwood. Make sure -stay on Beechwood Dr. Do not take another street that looks like it is towards sign. Only one takes you there is Beechwood Dr. From Franklin Av. in Hollywood, turn uphill onto Beachwood Canyon Dr. -park at end of Beachwood or in dirt parking lot further up towards trail. May come across official-looking traffic sign- ""No Access to Hollywood Sign"" . Ignore it. Was put up by residents to deter visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Don_K_12_12
30,"Close-up selfies are out, hikers beware","An American icon! Just an FYI really.. you can easily get this close by road, to an overlook (of LA) with great positioning for group photos, but don't bother trying to hike up to touch the sign from there... they guard it pretty well and have camera watching you approach. :/ Sadly, close-up selfies are out.

40,Small roads to the sign,"Not very special attraction but still a must-see when you are in Los Angeles.

Even closer can be reached, but this was enough for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278anttis
40,Iconic Hollywood sign,"We took the easy ""family friendly"" hike from Griffith Observatory starting at the Charlie Turner Trailhead. It was an easy walk and dog friendly too. It doesn't take you very close to the sign but close enough to get a good picture and great views of Hollywood. Definitely wear sneakers or closed shoes or your feet will be filthy as it's pretty dusty. There are bathrooms outside the observatory which is handy. We got there around 11:00 and found parking along the street but by the time we left it was very busy with limited parking so get there early if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kacid_13

10,I'll give it a one. Just because it symbolizes greed.,"I'll tell you why I've given this a one. It's because what is it? really... what is it? it's some letters in a hill. It's not really an attraction.But my main gripe is what is symbolizes. To me, the Hollywood sign screams artificial lives, greed, dirt, materialism. All the show and none of the substance!Which is pretty much what Hollywood is... a show, a place with no soul.Tourists pushing over each other to get snaps on famous names on the floor.Vile little place Hollywood.

40,Must see tourist spot,It's something we all see in the movies and on TV and being a landmark in LA it's something not to be missed. We saw the sign from Griffith Observatory while on a LA city tour. The day we were at the observatory it was misty and the photo's were not that clear. You can also see it from the back plaza of the Hollywood & Highland Center where we managed to get some better photo's. Overall a very good experience and a definite to do in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Larnel
40,Just like on TV!,Well nearly like on TV.. Bit more mist or smog... But good view from the middle of the shopping mall next to the TCL Chinese Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damientombs
40,View if from the Griffith Observatory,"This was going to be one of the highlights from my trip to L.A.When I talked to a guy at the hostel I stayed at, he said that instead of going up to the actual sign, which is boring since you see it from behind it and not from in front of it, you can go to the Griffith Observatory to have a very good view of the sign.The sign is placed on the top of a hill and can be viewed from many places, even downtown Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielHenrysson
30,Gotta take a picture of the sign.,"It's the most iconic thing in Los Angeles. We've seen it for years on tv and in movies. We took our photos while at the Griffith Observatory. While in Hollywood, I failed to look for the sign from ground level. I'm sure there are some good photo shots from the ground too. Even though it's just a sign on the hill, it still great to see it in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sightseesylviaP
50,breath taking,Seeing the Hollywood Sign on the hills really was something else! When you look at it you cant believe where you are!! Very busy what what would you expect!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623madeleined
50,When in Hollywood you have to get the photo with the sign,"The best way to see it up and close is driving up N Beachwood Drive. You will head directly towards the sign. Beware that many neighbouring streets are now blocked, as residents dont want all the tourists staying next to their mansion to take photos. Howveer, if you go up this street you got it! The street will then lead you also to a scenic drive where you can stop and take photos, however, I found that the stops had to many people and not enough parking. beachwood Drive is great!Another great place is the Griffith Observatory. From here you can also have a good look at the sign! The sun sets right next to the mountain with the sign, so evening pictures with the sunset are also great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjaK

50,Just Like in the Movies,"The iconic Hollywood Sign is truly a site to see. Lets be honest, it's just a sign, but we see it so often on TV or in movies that to finally see it in person is surreal. The best place I have found to take a nice look at it is from the back of the Hollywood and Highland complex, a great photo opportunity also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0wiek
40,Wonderful experience !!,We visited the sign yesterday in the evening. It was a wonderful experience. We parked our vehicle close to the dog park. The sign from this view point seems to be little far so we drove up the hill and parked it at a point closer to the sign. There are a couple of observation points at the top. Do not miss it !!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ranjithkoppu
50,Ten trips to California and this is the first time I caught sight of the sign!,"We were standing on the corner in front of Amoeba Records, on our way to Jack in the Box, and there it was through the morning haze!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildat50

40,"Kind of pain to get to, but you have to do it","You flew or drove ALL the way out to LA, so you HAVE to go a little further and get your picture taken with the Hollywood sign behind you. Yes, its completely a touristy thing to do, but come on. Its iconic and you have to do itThe best place to see the sign and get a great view of Hollywood/LA is 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood. You will be driving through a neighborhood, so be respectful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DFB69

40,Looks just like on TV,"As we drove around, we got many great views of the sign. The best view was when we went to Griffith Observatory and looked over to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANETM45
40,"Iconic, but Tricky","The first thing you need to know is: its hard to get a good picture of the ""Hollywood"" sign if you're not in a helicopter! I have been to LA many times - and tried on several occasions - to get a good pic. One thing people don't realize is how hilly most of the LA basin really is, so its not like you can see this sign far and wide ... you just can't.Two good spots I've found:The Hollywood Forever Cemetery at 6000 Santa Monica Boulevard - also the final resting place of many old-school Hollywood celebs. Free to park and walk around.Next to the upstairs Starbuck's in the backside of the outdoor shopping mall Hollywood & Highland (next to Grauman's Chinese Theater) at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. Parking is tight, but its on the LA Metro red line.Good luck - and bring your zoom lens!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ad709
50,Hollywood Sign Sunset View,"I have lived by this sign from my childhood. I decided I should take a tour of the sign. What a wonder tour we took. The tour guide was very knowledge about the sign, pictures, and history added to the tour. We were up there about sunset. It was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bledsoe2Bledsoe2
50,Really cool!,"Looking at the sign from the freeway is one thing, getting right behind it for a look is awesome! I don't remember how we did it, but there's a path that starts in a residential section and takes you right up to the back of the sign. You can't get close enough to touch the sign as it is fenced off, but still pretty cool. Allow about an hour to get up and back to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
50,Hollywood View,"It was a quick trip up the mountain, and it was worth it. It is sad that we can no longer get closer- and that's because of extra security that was added after 9/11/01. It's also unfortunate that the sign is no longer lit up at night!I saw the sign in many different angles in Hollywood- which by the way, is my new favorite city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenevieveRoxx
40,Sign that tingles,"You probably feel that you haven't really visited LA unless you've driven out to see the Hollywood sign. Hey, it's just an old sign, but even if you've see it many times before, its history still gives you a tingle when you see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CastawayKnight
50,An opportunity not to be missed a must Hollywood sign,"A must if you‚Äôre up to it, seeing it from a distance is one thing, hiking up Mt Lee to the summit is another and that‚Äôs what I did, and let me tell you the sense of satisfaction you get is amazing, since it is not an easy hike (and I mean hike) it‚Äôs not for the weekend walk up in jeans & high heels tourist whom I saw try. Have lots of water, comfortable shoes, sunscreen, a hat because it gets hot real fast, stay on the trail and don‚Äôt even think about taking a shortcut the trail is winding, steep and you have an abundance of wild life that signs points out and you should heed them as well. It can be pretty crowded and it can at times be pretty isolated with no one around the steep hills and cliffs so use common sense ( especially if you‚Äôre on your own) and be aware of your surroundings, I was amazed at some hikers who I‚Äôm not sure what they were thinking but should have been more aware of where they were and where they were going. Still when you reach the top of the sign the views are breath taking and you‚Äôll be surprised at what you find when you get there. Now where to start? It can be from the Griffith Observatory, or one of the canyon roads below with the info readily avail online and lastly have a plan, map, know when you‚Äôre going since you can very easily get lost or separated if you‚Äôre in a group, so happy trails and good luck. And 1 other thing hiking up was on my bucket list",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallyreidjr
50,Hooray for Hollywood,"OK You really can't get up close and personal with the sign because it's on private property I think. I've heard you can hike a trail to get to it, but if you're close to it you don't get the full effect of the big white letters on the hill! But you can see it from Hollywood with no problem. It's an icon that completes any trip to Hollywood. Go to the Hollywood & Highland Center; see TCLTheatre footprints, go up the steps to the Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre and out to the plaza. Magnificent view of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suitcasehandy

40,"Must see, I guess","Well, it's the Hollywood sign so after all these movies and endless tv shows you just HAVE to see it for yourself.

20,You just cannot get close enough to make it a memorable experience.,"If you are in the Hollywood area you really cannot miss seeing the Hollywood sign, and if you are the type person who either don't care or pay attention, it will be pointed out to you by almost everyone around you. Unfortunately the sign is almost impossible to get close to without a very hard hike up and mountain. Almost every tour has a stop on its route for the patrons to take a picture of the sign which is the best way to get a memory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaneH906
30,It's a sign. On a hill. ;p,"It's a sign. On a hill. You can't get close to it. But, you can take photos from Beverly Hills with it in the background. So doesn't take much effort, but it doesn't really inspire you in any way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robmmmkay
50,Best viewed from Griffith park observatory car park.,"The quintessential site to see in Los Angeles. You can see it from many places in the valley however I would suggest taking it in from Griffith park observatiory car park where you can also look down over downtown LA and the Walk of Fame area.One other place to get a good ""frame"" for your picture of the sign is the shopping mall just near to the walk itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goodgrr

40,Must seen,Who has been to Los Angeles without seeing the hollywood sign. But maybe you should climb up there to have a closer look.,
30,Ok...It's a famous sign but it's still just a sign,On one visit we snaked our way up through skinny neighborhood streets trying to get as close as possible and on the other we viewed it from Griffth Park Observatory. My advice is if you want a picture of it is to go late in the afternoon to Griffth Park and check it out also and stay for star viewing or whatever other program the have going on. It's a very cool place and a great view above LA too ! Admission is free to walk around but there is admission to the Planeterium show.,
30,One of those iconic places that really don't do much...,"I suppose if you were a hiker this would be great, but for me it was just interesting to see in person after only seeing it in movies for years.",
50,A Must for Residents and Visitors Alike!,"I grew up in the shadow of the Hollywood sign, but seeing it up close is always a fun time! A true icon of Los Angeles, a marker of history and a timeless image of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the sign beckons travelers to seek, see, and enjoy!",

40,Hollywood sign,"Found the local coaches don't actually give you enough time, so we hired our own driver to show us all the sights. He drove us to the appropriate street where we could take our photos with lots of time. Hiring your own driver was not expensive for the day and you could go where you wanted and not be kept waiting for everybody else. Make sure you check the prices first.",

40,Always a good time,Weather your looking for a hike or just like to stop at a iconic location the hollywood sign is a must see destination to anyone visiting la fun for all ages and great scenery for pictures,
50,Beautiful views at sunset and night.,We drove here ourselves at sunset. I recommend to go a little earlier so you can get some light pictures of the sign as it;s not lit up. But stay until the sun goes down as the views are beautiful. It can get busy but we went during the week. Also if you are a keen photographer you will need to use a tripod because of the lack of lighting. I have been told there are tours that go up there but not sure which ones. We did a daytime tour of the hollywood hills but it never came up this way. Great spot loved it.,

40,Iconic Sign,We happened upon a secret hiking trail that leads you to a spectacular view of the Hollywood Sign and the city of LA. We drove up Wonder View Dr. and enjoyed looking at the beautiful homes and came to a place where it was a private drive and noticed a hiking trail. We got out hoping it was across from the sign. After a few minutes we realized it was an incredible find. Such an amazing view!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H7956FAlisaw
40,Nice Landmark,"Really happy I was able to see this in person. It was visible from many parts of Hollywood, but the sign was very high up on a hill. This made taking photos with it difficult!

50,Very cool to see in person!,My husband and I were in Los Angeles for business for a few days and after our seminars decided to tour the city. One night we decided to drive up through the hills and hike the trail to the Hollywood sign. The hike was very steep in some places but after you get through it what a view you have. You only have to hike about 10 to 15 minutes to get to a good spot to take really good pictures of both the sign and the city below. Glad we did this while in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tarvum

40,"Good From Afar, But You Can't Get Close Enough","The best place to view the sign is from the top of Beverly Hills at the Griffith Observatory.

Then ,coming down we needed to get back to the observatory and ended up in some residential area heading toward Lincoln ave. had to catch a cab back up to the observatory. Yea I m no scout leader but a couple direction signs going up and down would be great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrdlcrw
50,It's iconic! A must see!,"If you are visiting L.A. and you go back home without having seen the Hollywood sign, you will never forgive yourself!There are several ways to see it. Hike or drive up to the Griffith Observatory. Go to the third floor of the Dolby theater pavilion. Go the the Hollywood park or hike up the trail that takes you behind it.The last two ways are the best, in my opinion. If you don't have time to hike, go to the Lake Hollywood Park. You can get some great shots of the sign, feel accomplished and be on your way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lyndarella18

50,Hollywood (Land) sign,We took one of those bus tours that drives you past homes of the movie stars and a stop for a photo op of the Hollywood sign. It was pretty far away but I still got a decent photo. Just hearing the sign's history was so interesting from it's beginning in 1923 (Hollywoodland) to it almost being torn down. It was refurbished in 1978 to the Hollywood sign we see now. Pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angela3950
20,Hard pass!,"Ugh! Attempted to hike the Hollywood Sign trail with my sister. Parking was IMPOSSIBLE to find, and people take the very windy, one-way road up and down the mountain at breakneck speeds! The hike itself was hot and dusty, and by the time we got to the top there was so much smog that the view wasn't even worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wisechel
30,Just few letters :(,I thought it's OK but not great.Parking is major problem because you have park on the roads. No entertaining for kids at all. Sometimes you don't see even dog there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vikaskhengare
30,I can Finally Say I Saw It,This sign can be seen from the Paramont Studio lot. This was my fourth visit to LA and I finally saw it while on the Paramont Studio Tour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKKelley3368
40,Good photo opportunity,"Took a bit of searching on the web to find this spot to view the sign, and after driving up some narrow side streets it was well worth the visit. We were able to get some good photos. On our visit there was an ice cream truck set up, so we enjoyed an iceblock taking in the views.Bit tricky to find the location but well worth the visit if you do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5824GPjasons
30,Iconic Hollywood,"The Hollywood sign is an icon on Hollywood, and it was fun to view it in person. That's it - not much more to it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sailorgirl461
30,Iconic and pure Hollywood,"It's iconic, it's been around forever but sort of a let down. There are several places where you can go see the sign reasonably close but most of them are in neighborhoods and I feel weird taking pictures of a sign in someone's front yard. Still worth doing once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatelG_12
50,great to see,the best view is the shopping complex along the walk of fame. Go to the second story for some great photos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertA1948
50,Best part of the trip!,"Hiking to the Hollywood sign was probably the highlight of my trip to LA. The combination of something so iconically LA with the opportunity to get outside and into the hills was perfect, and the views of the sprawling city were top class. And for $103 (and a criminal record), you can even touch the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/913alexy

30,Iconic landmark situated in the Hollywood Hills,"This iconic sign is a city landmark, situated in the Hollywood Hills, area of the Santa Monica Mountains. It was built in 1923 and can be seen from the Griffith Park Observatory.Not much in the way of 'visiting' the actual spot - because it is off-limits - but it can be seen on horse and hiking trails in the Griffith Park area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/123DRDEAN
40,Iconic Place in CA,"One of the most scenic view in CA, iconic place. You must take snaps while you visit this place. Specially during summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faisal021187
30,A nice Hike if you want to see the Hollyood Sign up Close,"To get to the Hollywood Sign up close there is a pretty cool little hike, however I would suggest going in the morning or in the evening, if it is a hot day it is not as enjoyable. The view from the top is a great view of the city and in my opinion a far better hike than the over popular Runyon Canyon which is way over crowded and hyped. However FYI the actual sign is gated off so the best views for pictures ect.. are as you are walking up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dreamontravler
30,Overall nice,It's very nice actually more the surroundings and view around the sign which makes it nicer. Nice lush green and nice park around. Beautiful lake view and Hollywood park to relax at.Soothing views for nature lovers. Very well kept,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711sadias
50,A local's Hollywood Sign Review,"I grew up under the sign on Deronda Dr. I lived there since my dad built the house in 1959. I have watched it go from a quiet little neighborhood. Us kids used to have a swing on the ""D"" pre '78 when the sign was wood frame. I know the guys responsible for the famous ""Hollyweed"" prank. Over the last few years with the posting to the internet of how to find it. People now over run this quiet neighborhood. Park anywhere, throw trash. I ask, be respectful, please. Enjoy the hike, take pictures, just realize, people call the area where you park, home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228royn

50,Most Family Friendly Attraction in LA,"Hiking to the Hollywood sign is definelty a must do for any first time Los Angeles visitor. Not only is parking free on streets, but the view is amazing. Yes, it gets crowded on weekends and it's a HIKE, but that's the beauty My friends in eye, made this our main attraction during our Day in LA. After you do this in the morning, hit up Hollywood Blvd, Millions of Milkshakes, and then finish your day off at Venice. CHEAP,FREE,SIGHTS",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalkid714
50,Superb View,That was a long shot but well placed.You can take pictures from a rock near by. and good view of the city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akarshk2014
50,Awesome!,"It was a really nice hiking, I truly recommend. Unfortunately, it is not possible to stay closer to the hollywood letters, but still it's a wonderful landscape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MRitaPinto
40,A must see for any visit to LA,"Whats the first thing you think of when thinking of Hollywood? The Hollywood sign of course! So it's a must do for anyone visiting the area. We managed a car park close to the Griffith Observatory so it was only a short uphill walk, but totally worth it. To see the sign ""in real life"" is surreal when you've only seen it in pictures and on TV/movies. The day was a bit smoggy, but still the sign stood proud. A great day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meganb530
30,Not as glamorous as anticipated.,We took some good photos of this from the viewing area in downtown LA and it was nice to look at what we've seen on TV and in films for years. I was expecting something a bit more upmarket but was not too disappointed - and at last we know it is really there ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peter_x_godden
50,Gotta see once,I was in LA on business and have never ventured to Hollywood and the iconic sign. I decided to make the trek. I found a route that took me to Lake Hollywood Park. The view was great from here. There are many views available but this one let me maximize my time by driving most of the distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baldgiraffe
50,A must see...and free,We drove to Griffin observatory to view the sign. Great view and free. A lot of cars but easy to park as a lot of people are coming and going.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamescaje
50,Scale an Icon,I think a hike up to the Hollywood sign is probably more meaningful than trolling the Avenue of the Stars. Keep your eyes peeled for the coyotes. They are not terribly shy and they will walk right by you on the path but I've never had problems with them. It is a bit of a hike so be sure to hydrate regardless of the time of year. The sign itself is pretty cool. It hasn't said Hollywoodland for years but it used to. I think most people committed suicide by jumping of the end of the sign that is no longer present. Where I am going here is the sign is great but the view of the city is wonderful. Almost as good as the views from the Observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenC35
30,The Famous Hollywood Sign,"First off if your in Hollywood for a tour/visit of the city and this is not on your list, what is wrong with you?!?! This icon sign is what everyone should see at least once. I took a tour group up to the sign and stopped near the Lake Hollywood Park which is a little dog park near the sign; had a great view of the sign.Protip: wear comfortable shoes (no flip-flops) as you will be walking a bit on uneven terrain and bring a friend as to get really good (funny) camera shots you need someone else to hold the camera ie: holding the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191joshg
50,Must see attraction!!,"Me and a friend decided to hike the Hollywood sign instead of doing a tour. We left around 10am and arrived back around 3pm. It is a must see when in LA, it is hard work. But worth it when you get to the top!! Make sure you take plenty of water because it gets hotter the higher you go, it is also pretty steep and a lot of walking for the day. I highly recommend doing the hike instead of a tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayleighh2013
40,It has to be done!,"There is always a frisson of excitement when one spots this sign for the first time. It would be even better if it was lit up at night, but nevertheless it it an American icon, and therefore a 'must see' experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lino144
50,Hiked to the sign. Very cool!,"Great hike. Took the Hollyridge Trail route via Franklin/Beachwood Canyon. Get there early. We started at 7:00am on a Sunday (so we were able to park on street) and it was great and not crowded going up. Took about 45 minutes. When we were on our way down there were lots of people starting to go up. When driving to the entrance, you can ignore the signs that say no access to Hollywood Sign. You can't park by entrance as it is gated with a guard. But, you can park two stops signs down from the entrance (that is what the guard told us). Great experience, views, and nice little hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonc220
50,When in Hollywood,What trip to Hollywood is complete without a picture of the Hollywood sign.Canyon Lake Drive is a good vantage point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlightlessBird75
50,A must,"It's a must on your visit. We went up the observatory route and it was a nightmare. There was some concert and traffic crawled, we could have parked our car, walked up the 1 mile and been back and still not have moved. It took us over an hour to go 1 mile. We got up to the observatory and it was still far off in the distance. Tomorrow were planning another route that brings you closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HAM04
50,Iconic Art Installation,"You cant go to LA and no see the sign from the corner of your eye. Getting up close is difficult but that not what its about but if you want to walk up then go to the end of North beachwood and then take a trail. Its light granite and small dusty gravel and up and down so you will slip and slide. Dont forget that its desert. The sign is iconic and I love it! get up near, up Laurel or NBW and take classic piccys. My best time is early morning in summer. Heat and haze. No way is this Icon run down. Its fresh and sparkling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/514DavidS
30,We hiked to the sign - a bit disappointing -,"There are NO signs on the trails leading to the Hollywood sign. Even with Google Maps, we still had to back-track a few times. Other groups of hikers that we ran into said the same thing. We ended up taking the hardest trail to the sign, which wasn't hard at all. Some hikers who we passed on our way up (they were coming down) said they had just seen a rattlesnake on the trail, but we didn't run into any. We reached the top only to find out the sign is gated off, and you cannot get close to it, unlike the pictures we have seen online. There are much more scenic hikes in LA, and I wish we would have passed on this experience. (our hike was 5.5 miles)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cariski
30,"Proceed at you Own risk, Traffic and unfriendly resoidents",The Sign is great to see from Mount Hollywood Drive only. If you go close to the sign up Beachwood drive there is likelihood that you will get a traffic ticket. The sign can also be viewed from famous Hollywood and highland,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
50,Tired Sign,Can only see from a distance. Looks a bit run down. Nostalgic experience. You need a car to get here. Our teenage boys were wrapped to see this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/624karenr
40,Pretty cool,"Even for a cynic like me, you'd be hard pressed to not find something pretty cool about seeing this iconic sign from a distance.At first I didn't even notice it as we drove up and around East Hollywood, but then all of a sudden I look up and think 'oh sh**"" there it is! So then came the challenge of finding the best spot to photograph it.After a quick look on Google, it was suggested we drive up Beachwood Drive for the best glimpses, but once you get to Scenic Avenue, the view gets more obscured. We headed up that way and certainly got some amazing views. We had to pull over and walk along the path to get a longer view, as this route is best by car. Other suggestions where to go up Canyon Drive but we decided that once we'd seen the sign and got some photos there was no reason to go chasing other routes.The area itself is pretty cool, lots of winding roads and fabulous houses. It's not an easy place to navigate without a good map, but Google did the job.I certainly recommend going for a drive to spot this iconic and universally recognised sign representing the glitz and glamour of American stardom, especially if you are in the area and want to add this to your overall Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantalTee
50,"No pain, no gain","A steep walk up from Beachwood Drive, the 1 hour walk up the hill (and associated burning thigh muscles!) is 100% worth it. We took the long way up behind the Hollywood sign where the views of the vista were stunning. I recommend not just walking part-way to the front of the sign, but right to the top to walk behind it. A must-do when in LA - don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaJNZ
50,Iconic,"Just a shame you can get near it but you can get close enough to get a good picture. Set your sat nav to 34.125592, -118.326115 for a cler and safe place to take as many pics as you want",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_NIron

40,From a distance,As viewed from the Highland and Hollywood Mall. One of the true modern icons and famous around the world. Can be viewed from other parts of LA including Dodger Stadium.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
40,Please stop taking photos from Beachwood Drive,"Hi, I live on Beachwood Drive and the amount of tourists that stop in the middle of the street, snapping photos, stopping traffic and endangering themselves when a frustrated neighbor brazenly drives the posted 30mph past them....is terrifying. I know that you can see the sign from there, but you are endangering yourself and others.PLEASE...drive up to Canyon Lake Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90068. There is a place to pull over and take a photo with a very clear shot of the Hollywood sign behind you. It's a remarkable landmark that we are all proud of, but a photo isn't worth the risks that dozens of tourists place themselves in on a daily basis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PennyVital
50,Iconic view!,This is one of the places you have to go when in LA.It takes your breath away when driving into the city and actually seeing the famous sign.I hope everyone gets a chance to see this. Beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jodibrogan
40,Iconic,viewed the sign from Griffith Observatory - good view but the sign is still a long way. Didn't bother going closer. Felt I had to get a picture !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pommieexpat
30,It is a sign for a Housing development.,OK.. it is an old sign put up to sell houses - HOLLYWOODLAND - the land fell down during an earthquake. See it and enjoy but the walk.. hike to it is just ok.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266jerryp
50,This is the epitome of all Hollywood Must Do's!! How can you not click this Photo?,"The tour that I took was very well paced and they gave us lot of insights. The charter dropped us right in front of Madame Tussauds off Hollywood Boulevard and we walked past the Chinese Theatre to the huge shopping Mall.Take the escalators to the top and cross the main shopping arena. Immediately in front of you, are the observation floors, on the 2nd and third floor wherein stands the famous Hollywood Sign. It is far away but if you have a good zoom lens this is worth capturing.I walked straight up to the top most floor and although this is a Hotel Guests zone only, I had no trouble in clicking snaps and coming down. There were so many people, no one actually bothered!Please, do not listen to the other travelers....How can you not do this when you are in Hollywood??? Beats me!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeDiaries

It was absolutely perfect!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Just_Another_Gringa
30,Hmm seen it but not much to say,It's pretty cool but you can't get close at all because it is restricted access. You do get a good view from the Griffiths observatory though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andymarriott90
40,One stop shop,It was nice to check this stop off my bucket list. It was a tad disappointed that we couldn't get close to it. Stunning views all around it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carpediem109115
10,Peh,Saw from the Griffith Observatory and I didn't feel anything at all. Might give you an idea about how unnatural lives and human relations in Hollywood. Don't worry at all if you don't see it. Watch some more movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barkan
30,Oh Hollywood!,"The Hollywood sign is such a famous landmark! But if you don't have a car, it might be hard to get up close. We stayed at the W Hollywood Hotel off of Hollywood Blvd, and walked down to the shopping center near the Chinese Theater and went to the overlook walkway on the second or third floor, and were able to take some great zoom photos. At least this is an option if you're not able to get up close and personal. A few minutes of awe and you're done, ready to move on to the next sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steamboat323
50,A must see...then move on,This is a must see and we viewed it from Griffith Park. It was fun to finally see it in person. After a few minutes though it was time to move on...more sites to see.,
40,Neat,"Didn't take the hike to see this up close, saw it from a distance and thought that was enough. Was pretty neat to see it nonetheless.There are much more interesting things to see and do in LA, but for kicks why not try and see this?Certainly worth a quick look.",
50,Most definitely!,"It's a must do in LA, there are numerous routes to the top of the sign, every route offers another observation point, google the routes, in advance. Once at the top there are many famous sights to see, including the LA downtown skyscrapers. The sign itself is heavily protected, no climbing unfortunately :-(",
40,Go early... Could have a bit of a walk!,We went early as we were told that it could be busy. We arrived at 10am and the road leading to it was lined with cars. We had a 15 min walk to the best photo opportunity spot.Worth it though to have a picture with the iconic site in the background.,
50,Hike to Hollywood Sign. Check.,"This review is for the hike to the Hollywood Sign via Hollyridge Trail from Beechwood Drive. About a 1-2 hour, 2.5 mile easy to moderate hike, this takes you directly behind the sign - for free. Park off the residential area on Beechwood Dr that does not require permit parking, otherwise you will get a ticket- there is a patrol car patrolling constantly. There is a guard by the gate, and you are welcome to bring your dog (of all shapes and sizes). A smart hiker knows to come early before it gets hot and bring good shoes, sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, water, camera and snacks (poop baggies, snacks, and water for your pup). It is also a horse trail so expect unwillingly inhaling all the horse droppings on your way up. However, the horse trail diverts somewhere else and you pass through what seems like bushes of fennel fronds and the aroma is wonderful. When you finally get to the sign, you unfortunately can't touch the sign cause it is fenced over and has a lot of surveillance cameras. But the views are great! It overlooks the entire city. I would definitely hike it again, which works out well for me cause I live close by.To research more about the hike (like I did-and not get into this love it loathe it reviews on the sign), hollywoodsigntrip.com helped for me and check out yelp for the Hollyridge Trail review and updates.",
50,Movie like!,"As seen in any movie or tv series, the hollywood sign is one of the most characteristics places in Hollywood. Its so much better to get there on foot! The sightseing is beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boojua
20,Doesn't get close to Hollywood sign,"This review is for the shuttle to the Hollywood sign and Griffiths Observatory, not Griffith Observatory itself. For $10 it's just basically a shuttle from the parking lot at the Greek theater at the bottom of the hill to the observatory. You barely get close to the sign at all- very disappointing- just take your pictures from the observatory and save time. Ticket purchase is convoluted, as you must buy in advance and bring proof with you. You can not buy tickets on the bus and despite bus being almost empty driver turned away at least 4 people trying to get on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PineappleFriend
20,Why is this interesting?,"This LA icon is better viewed on television. Parking is horrible, the locals do not like you taking over the limited parking here. If this is what represents LA , we have a big issue. Here is my suggestion. Go to Beachwood and Frankin, jump out of your car and take a picture. Tell your friends you were there and they will be impressed. Your out of town friends will not know the difference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
30,It's cool to see,I guess you could say its a tourist thing but it is cool to see. We were walking around a shopping mall and could see it through an opening between to building. We went over closer to where you walk up to see it but didn't get very close. How many times was this seen on tv or in movies and it was kinda neat to actually be looking up at it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDTravelhome

50,"For hikers, not tourists","It can be difficult to figure out where to park, so equip yourself with knowledge and research before you try this.If you're a tourist who wants to check out the sign, it's somewhat underwhelming but gives you a great view of Los Angeles . . . as long as you can see through the smog. However, if you're not into hiking, simply don't bother - it'll be a waste of time, and if you're not in shape you may actually regret it.There's plenty of hiking in the area that doesn't involve the Hollywood sign - it's merely one part of the park - so it is possible to take a stab at it and enjoy the area and weather and turn back when you're exhausted.Be sure to bring water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosenb37
50,Fitness after a long flight,"Feeling in the buzz of the Hollywood spirit and you want that experience of being able to nearly touch the sign this is the walk for you.This was my 20 yr old's daughter choice and a great choice at that as you meet the locals and have fitness at the same time.So catch the bus 222 from Hollywood/Highland Street, just outside McDonalds to Barham/Lake Hollywood Drive.It is 17 stops and only takes 15 minutes and US$2.How cheap is that!Then it is a 45 minute walk down Lake Hollywood Drive,Turn into Tahoe Drive then turn right into Canyon Lake Drive,then walk your little legs off to Lake Hollywood Park which is a park just for dogs. We had our picnic lunch here and met some locals had a chat.Lovely view of the lake in the distance and beautiful well kept homes and everyone is very very friendly which was nice.You see private homes that have helicopter surviellience.If I was here another day i would do the walk down to the lake.All in all a great outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorainev861

50,Wonderful brunch and hike! -- See the sign like a local would.,"Go up Beachwood Drive until you pass through the Hollywood gates. On your left, stop at the Beachwood Cafe (great basil-mint lemonade and don't miss the Graciosa salad.) Then continue on the road to your left (Belden)past the Beachwood Market to Durand and keep climbing until you reach the walking path that overlooks Hollywood Reservoir. Wind around till it meets the road again and enjoy a fantastic view of the sign. Meander back downhill through winding streets lined with beautiful homes. A real treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ruhskis

40,Must Do Once,Even if you live in LA you need to see the Hollywood sign up close. There are a few things you should before making the trip. You can hike up to the sign either in front of it or behind it You can not touch it but you can get close. If you hike you can park at Griffith Park and head up. Wear tennis shoes and take water If you are feeling adventurous then you can hike to the Griffith Observatory as well.If you are not into hiking you can always get a picture from the street. The view is good depending on how you get there. We were able to get a great view from Beachwood St. Keep in mind there are many people doing the same thing. You will be able to pull over to the side of the street and snap a picture. There is no parking and they do write tickets so do not park and try to walk up closer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
30,Scenic beauty,I took a 1 day tour from Las Vegas to Hollywood and our stop was Hollywood Sign.The sign was situated above the mountains and we could view from the closest point where our car stopped.The view was good and we took some memorable pics.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Riddhi26
30,just for a picture,its just a sign and that's all. There is now way to get to the sigh itself and touch it. It's even surrounded by a fence. So you should just try to find a nice spot to get a picture of you with the sign in your back. My picture spot was at the Highland Mall near Chineese theater in Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alerf
40,Iconic Hollywood,Everyone has to have a pic of the sign as its iconic Hollywood at its best. Driving up is tight so be wary of oncoming traffic. Parking is limited but not all that bad when we went. View of downtown as well as beautiful homes of the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terminator1138

40,cool to see in person,We put Mulholland drive in our GPS and drove up the mountainside winding around hollywood hills near the hollywood sign area. Incredibly beautiful homes up there set on some very steep edges. Scary steep but well worth the adventure. Eventually we found Runyon Canyon Park where you get a really good view of sign. Very steep drive. very cool - don't miss experiencing this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bornnorb
50,A great adventure to see the sign!!!,We loved driving around L.A. and seeing glimpses of the sign. We drove around and took lots of pictures. We loved the adventure of choosing which way to go next. The sign is a must see when you are in L.A. We drove up to the park and even saw a cougar roaming the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gopackgoXO
40,iconic sign,it's a big white sign....you cant walk or drive up to it just get close through some residential areas. the 'sign' is signposted. you can literally jump out of the car take a photo.... some people were parking up and going for hikes in the hills. visible as you land and take off from LAX.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katie780
40,The Iconic Hollywood sign,Climbing all the way to Mulholland just to get a view of the iconic Hollywood sign was simply breathtaking. Who would've thought that the Hollywood sign started off as a real estate gimmick to attract potential buyers. Now it is the symbol of the city of angels. Recommended for those who would want to know the history of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMarquez
40,More than a sign to see!,"Once in LA, there is one thing you must absolutely do, see the Hollywood sign!It's worth it and you'll also enjoy a great view of the city.If you go see the sign at Griffith Observatory, I'll recommend to also spend some time at the observatory. It very nice and the shows are great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jun0N
50,legendary,"Ok,for me this was very nice and interesting to see. Was good experience, because of all movies that I ever watch and i really wanted to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SladjLa
30,See it and go!,"We went to Griffin Park to get a view of the Hollywood sign, where there was easy street parking. It's still a fair way in the distance but the view is clear and it's not crowded. The advantage of going here is that you can then visit the Observatory which is well worth a visit and is free - see other reviews of this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scotties00
50,Sign me up..,The sign is an icon of LA and you should definitely make sure to capture a picture. Most tours cover the sign and take you up to the sign in the Hollywood Hills...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh007
40,Iconic,"This is my second visit to the sign and I feel it's more about the journey then the destination. You can take Mulholland Drive or another route, and see the neighborhoods while navigating the winding road. I stood there over 20 years ago and took a picture - it looks like my hand is holding the sign. And now many years later, my daughter took the same picture. It's iconic, historic, views are nice, and it's a cool way to make family memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ttaylor2u2
40,A must see,It maybe just a sign but it is something you have to see when you visit LA. You can't get very close to it but there are plenty places you can get a good view of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tracy-A-Scott
30,You can't actually get there,"The sign is an iconic piece of LA history, and can be seen from many different LA neighborhoods, but it's important to note that you can't actually drive up to it and that it's gated off. The hikes that lead ""to the Hollywood Sign"" actually take you BEHIND the sign. It's interesting and the pictures can be great, but the experience often isn't what visitors expect.To hike to the sign, I suggest starting in Griffith Park and making a day (or 1/2 day) of it. You should be in reasonable shape and definitely have water, but it's not too strenuous if you go at your own pace. There are also a couple trailheads that start in the Beachwood Canyon neighborhood, but it can get really congested and parking on weekends is permit only. Since you'll likely have to walk up Beachwood and through the neighborhood, I think you might as well start in Griffith and get more views, but that's just me. The trail to the sign can be accessed via multiple routes. Bronson Canyon and the Griffith Observatory are both good options (http://hollywoodsign.org/hiking-to-the-sign/). Please stay on trails and be safe.If you just want to take a picture, I think Lake Hollywood Park will get you the best view for a photo, but you will have to brave some pretty confusing canyon streets to get there. Definitely look up directions before you head out, as reception is notoriously spotty in that area. The Hollywood and Highland mall is a popular option because it's right on the main drag and it has elevated walkways that are basically there to give you a photo op of the sign. Griffith Observatory also has pretty good views of the sign.If you don't want to hike and would like to get closer to the Hollywood sign, I would suggest looking into a guided horse-back ride with Sunset Ranch or the shuttle that the city operates on weekends (http://www.laparks.org/shuttle/shuttle.htm).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reller221
50,Sacrilege,"It's just a sign -- and not for me to judge it. I felt privileged to see it 'in person' and am glad it lost the ending (land). It's a part of the beginning and all that ""Hollywood"" means to us and the rest of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mary8235
50,Hollywood,After driving up the steep hollywood hills we got the closest as you can get possible lots of people looking for a good foto spot as well was a good time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luna6373
50,How Could You Not?,"It's the Hollywood Sign...Like Miley Cyrus in her 'Party in the USA' I felt like life was a crazy, surreal place whenever I ""looked to and [saw] the Hollywood sign.""The Hollywood Historic Hotel on Melrose Avenue has stunning views of it (ask for a front [north] facing room).Hollywood Blvd's views of it are surprisingly disappointing. Even Hollywood and Highland Centre (where the Dolby and Chinese Theatres are), which has walkways built in order for you to see it, isn't that great a view.We spent a day in Griffith Park, which contains Mount Lee, the Mountain the Sign is on. We walked up to it.You can't get very close to it, but I will post a picture of how close we were to it.You can also go over it, but I didn't see the point in looking down on it from Above.You can get pretty close, but any closer and there is security that warn you to step away from it. The person they were warning was wise enough to step away, so I don't know what happens if you don't.Below I've put less than one hour, but it was a five hour hike to the sign on the route we took; so when I say less than one hour I mean you will spend less than one hour actually standing there and taking pictures with it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaveyCowpar

20,Disappointing,The Hollywood sign is very iconic and it is very disappointing that you cannot get close to it. We viewed it from Griffiths park. Do not come here thinking you will only be a few metres away. You will be a few miles away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy22102
40,Awesome bucket list,Decided to drive from vegas to LA for the night....in the morning drove up to Hollywood hills to see the sign..the drive was lovely and the view from the top of the hill looking at the sign was breathtaking. ...if it's on your bucket list...do it....2 days in LA...enjoyed it more then vegas. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180bhupinderb
30,Nice,"It is nice to see the sign of hollywood, but there is not much in it, it is just the sign really, but of course a must do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43priscilas
50,Tip,"Here is a great tip for all my fellow tripadvisors. Most people taking pictures that we saw stopped at the bottom of the hill to take pictures. The houses up the hill, many belonging to famous people, are not in a gated community. You can drive right to the top. Its very windy and steep, be careful. Use North Beachwood Dr. as a starting point. My wife spotted Alan Tudyk walking his dogs. I had no idea who he was until I googled him after. Next time I'm in L.A. I'm definitely doing this again, even for the windy steep drive, it was loads of fun. Hope this was helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClickCrazy
40,Iconic,"Nothing like seeing it from any angle...especially if your close to it...you don't have to spend a lot on a tour, just hike or drive to it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
40,Exciting,"Yes, it was exciting when I first spotted the Hollywood sign. I researched online to see what was the best place to see the sign but it turns out that it is quite viable from many places within Hollywood Boulevard. There is a viewpoint in the Hollywood hills (there's a car park).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/expatEdinburgh
40,You know you are in Hollywood and feel the Energy when you see the Iconic Sign,What can I review? It is just a good feeling to see the sign whether you are on Hollywood Blvd or on Mulholland Dr.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christK5337IE
30,"Lovely views and landmarks, parking is busy!",As quite a few people have said to truly appreciate this landmark you need to get close. Worthwhile combining it with trip to the Griffiths observatory to get good views of the sign as well as the city. Again most do attraction of you are visiting for the first time just be aware that parking will be a nightmare and you could end up parking a long way away from good vantage points.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheMysteriousOne
40,Picture Perfect...almost,"You can't take a trip to Hollywood and return home without a picture in front of the famous landmark! We discovered--thanks to a tour guide--that the best location to pose is at the Griffith Observatory lookout. It is a busy location, but we were happy with our rushed picture but the sign looks a long ways away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Polar_Opposites
40,A must see.,"It was nice seeing this famous sign & to take photographs as its a world famous sign, and to see it in real life was s a wonderful feeling. A must see if you visit LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DilrukshiH
40,Nothing Like Seeing Something in Person!,"When my son and I took a tour in LA recently, one of the stops was the Griffith Observatory, from which we were able to see the Hollywood sign in person. While we were quite some distance away, it was a fun thing to check off of our lists. The tour guide told us the interesting history of the sign (Did you know that it was originally erected for a housing development called Hollywood Land and made of wood?), as well as the fact that each of the letters are around fifty feet tall and made entirely of metal. The tour guide also mentioned that it is now quite impossible to get really close to the sign (as well as rather dangerous), and that there are cameras mounted all around it in the event a trespasser gets any ideas....All in all, a very fun thing for us Midwesterners to see with our own eyes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geneva_IllinoisJanet
50,Hiked the Hill to the Sign,What an amazing hike on the rim of the mountain ridge!!! This hike had been on my bucket list for years and I knew there are several ways up the mountain but we chose to hike from the reservoir. The Wisdom Tree is on the path and then at the top looking down those huge letters that have stood there for many years. Priceless!! There are easier ways to reach the summit but this was to be more than that. You are in a city with millions of people but yet there is only a half a dozen or so on top of this mountain. Crazy!! Yes it is a must see in Hollywood!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/escrowmom
30,Need to get close...,"Wasn't able to get close to the sign, but read a recent review that mentions Sunset Ranch Horseback Riding. Seeing the sign in person from a distance was just okay for me. I'd REALLY love to get close - both to gain some perspective on the size of the sign and to enjoy the views of the city from that area. I'll bet it's amazing. But I'd rather KNOW, as opposed to imagine...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sox1fan
50,You CAN walk to the sign!!!,"A company called Sunset Ranch Horseback Riding Tours will get you on a horse and up close to the sign. If you're not keen on getting on a horse (or world rather walk yourself like we did) the company allows public access through their pedestrian gate so people can hike up to the sign. There are 2 routes - one goes up to a very close distance at the front of the sign and the other goes up to a place on top of the sign. You must then hike down a steep decent that doesn't look easy (to be honest) to reach the actual sign. You WILL go past ""no trespassing"" signs to get there. We drove up to the ranch entrance and parked on the street. It's free parking but it's busy. It's something everyone HAS to do in Hollywood or its not worth coming. The views are just amazing - even through the thick smog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FirstimeblogR
40,A Sign Not Followed,"Even though Hugh Hefner has fronted a ton of money to keep this sign alive, there is really no way for anyone to get to it. It is closed. So, the only way to see the sign is from a distance. There are a few trails in LA with sign views, but the Hollywood Reservoir is an easy walk around a paved road. No dogs are allowed, which is a total bummer, but you can bring kids and scooters and bikes. For most of the hike, the sign is not in view. But the few times it is, it is a great view.There are no amenities here, just porta potties. Yuck! Bring water, a hat, snacks for the kids and your camera and be prepared to walk an hour or so. More if you slow down to look around. Once you start, you kinda have to finish if you want to see the sign, so it is an all or nothing activity, Keep on to look out for wildlife. You may get a great photo op.Along the route, you get to see some pretty nifty homes, and if you are into this kind of thing, it's a lot of fun. Many locals use this as a regular exercise route. Just keep to the right and it's not a problem.The streets to get here are narrow beyond narrow. If you have a choice, try to drive a smaller car. Of course larger cars can be used, it is just a bit treacherous. Parking is on dirt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/928katherinek
30,The famous sign,You can see the sign from anywhere in Hollywood I think. It was cool to see for firt time California explorers but at the end of the day its just a sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natzelim2014
40,Great View,Great hike up the Hollywood hills. Unfortunately the sign is fenced off but the views are spectacular. Parked in Griffith park and an easy hike to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abelincoln1
40,"So close,yet so far!!","Windy road and still too far up. but you could see the Hollywood sign from ontop of a hill where I guess its the main stop over for sight seeing. A good experience though,i would recommend you take a local tour operator to explain the historical aspect of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236sj
30,If only you could get closer....,"If only you could get closer.....You have to drive through windy little streets to get to an oval where the sign is still a fair way away. BUT having said that, it is still the HOLLYWOOD sign and at the time, it was still something we were able to cross off our ""to-do-list"" on our holiday from Australia. We hired a car, and the drive there was nice, so it was worthwhile in the end. And i can say that i have actually seen it!!!Just a note: be careful not to stop on the side of the road where parking is not allowed. Police patrol that area and the car full of tourists that stopped in front of us holding up traffic learnt the hard way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeeDee1982
30,Can't get as close as was expecting...,"Maybe it was down to lack of research but I didn't realise you couldn't get that close to the sign, although we had a car hired and the drive up there was amazing.Well worth seeing and glad to say I've seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjr985
10,Overrated Billboard,Ok so wind through small roads to get close enough to take a picture of a billboard if that is your idea of fun. Its a landmark.....kind like the California mudslides.... but you may want to spend your time doing something more productive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z8087FSmarkr

30,"well its only a sign, but you know you got to do it","Ok so its a sign, and its a bugger to get anywhere close, we spent a whole morning driving around trying to get a good snap shot, and eventually (more by luck than planning) we did.Where we were when we took our pictures I havent a clue being honest, but it was a busy street and I had to dodge a few cars and one bus to get a good shot, not alot you can say really, but if your in hollywood, its got to be the most iconic shot you can get and you daft not to try (just dont do what we did and get in the car and take your own route, PLAN)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3441BPpaula
40,Hiking the Hollywood Sign,"The Hollywood Sign offers many entrances, almost from every direction, if I'm feeling adventurous as always, I take the west entrance, when I'm feeling like I need a real workout, I come from the Observatory (11 miles round trip), and when I'm bringing my 9 year old and my 12 year old I take the south entrance (3 mile round trip) and park at 2800 North Beachwood Drive, Los Angeles, CA, any closer to the sign and you'll be required to show a parking permit. I seen grandmas doing this ""hike"" the road is very nice. So get your hike on.For a better picture I suggest picking up camera above your head and pointing down at the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/122oscarm

50,Best views from Griffith Observatory,"I found that the best views of the sign are from the Griffith Observatory. It's still far off in distance but you can see it beat there.

40,A must when in LA,No trip to LA would be complete without seeing the sign! A great photo opportunity. Fabulous to see it in real life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashakins09
30,Highly overrated!,"The kids wanted to see this so badly we took a side trip to show it to them. Realistically with small kids you can't take the hike to get underneath it, so we took the car to the opposing canyon and took a few piccies there. Really it's never as good as in the movies because you aren't in a helicopter. Kids were a bit disappointed but on a very hot day walking up to the sign just isn't going to happen!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Australiafair2013
40,Great Hike with a great view,"I work at a car rental at lax, I really don't recommend for the tourist to go unless you plan to hike , hard for a good quality picture unless you do hike ...

From our rented vacation apartment, we could see it perfectly and it was a daily reminder of paradise.

So we get to appreciate it from a distance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatSnyder
40,Hollywood Sign,"Its kind of a must do, one thing off your checklist when you visit Los Angeles. You can view the sign from many different places, Griffith Observatory, Dolby Theatre. But take the Mulholland Hwy if you want a close look of the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnonD28
50,Shuttle service to Hollywood Sign & Griffith Observatory,This was the best $10 spent on our entire trip to CA! It was a hot day and we were happy we didn't have to make the long hike uphill to see the Hollywood sign. Check out the link below for the LA Department of Recreation and Parks program that provides shuttle to the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory. It runs every Saturday and Sunday and some holidays but you need to make reservations early.

40,How is a sign so hard to get a picture of - Hollywood Sign,"So our excursion to get a picture with the Hollywood sign was frustrating.Don't trust googlemap.Useless.We ended up after asking many people how to find the sign, and no one really knew how (yes, I know many may wonder how cannot you not find such a big sign)I believe the street we found best was Beachfront.Still wasn't the greatest though for selfies.We did manage it though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nykkyl
30,Well.....,"It's one of those things you need to check off your list, but don't make a special trip to see it cause you'll be disappointed. My advice, take pictures from the Griffith observatory, which is worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaliaG84
10,Very disappointed,We did a tour with starline tours of stars and beaches was very disappointed with the tour for one did go anywhere near the the Hollywood sign and didn't go to some of the place promised on the tour the driver was rush rush rush and took you were he wanted to go so my advice is if you want a tour of stars and beaches don't go with starline tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielj824
40,Hollywood,"Enjoyable trip, we organised a cab from the Hotel and found this a cheaper way to get around than some of the tours but it depends on what you want to see, as it was our 4th trip we only wanted to see the sign so a cab was a good way to get around, Many of the drivers will oblige. The hotel had what they called a home car but we found this was more expensive than a cab, you don't need long at the sign, a few pictures and we were done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethhW8095HY

30,Most overrated tourist attraction in L.A.,"I grew up here so my opinion is tempered. It is a mystery to me the intrigue this sign has on some out of towners, as if pixie dust will somehow sprinkle them with Hollywood magic. That said, it's worth seeing but there's no need to travel up back roads to get as close as possible. It can easily be viewed from the Hollywood Highland complex on the corner of Hollywood Blvd and Highland. The best spot would be the food deck on the 4th floor under the giant elephant statues. Most cell cameras can zoom in and you can get a good shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/266PaulR
40,It's cool,I would recommend seeing this from a helicopter! The best way.It's a really cool symbol of Los Angeles but nothing as far as activities when you get there.A lot of people hike to it which makes it a great way to see it.You can also see it from the side when you go to the Griffith Observatory!I would not recommend a walking tour through a neighborhood since you don't get the best views that way and annoy the locals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562margaritas

30,Enjoy from the city,"Can see the sign from many parts of the LA area. Watch for it! Didn't see or feel a need to drive up closer to it. Can see it very well from the mall on Hollywood Blvd. Go to 2nd or 3rd level and look out for a better view. You have to see it as its iconic, don't see why you'd need to go to it though.

30,I actually hiked there to the letters,"Back when it wasn't fenced off and secured. Hiked from Mt. Hollywood Dr. in Griffith Park before the road was closed to the SF Valley. This was back when the letters were still rickety. If you go from the Mulholland Dr. side there are signs warning you not to trek up the hill and it's fenced, cam'd and razor wired and neighbors are complaining about parking of visitors trying to get to it.. Just a thought to the powers that be-develop an attraction for a nominal fee with a tram like they do at the ""Getty' the goes from Griffith Observatory to the sign, Put up an multi level observation deck and stairs and such around the sign and let people visit, offer for a premium price at night visits/rent out for groups etc. Of course no one of any of the powers that be will be reading this. But they'll only read this when the neighbors whining about parking below will reach a 'can get me elected in the next election' pitch.

20,How do you get to the Hollywood sign??,We went up to the Observatory on a Sunday afternoon and drove for about 45 minutes looking for the Hollywood sign to no avail. It was very crowded up there and we drove around and around but never found a glimpse of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoelleR842
50,Best place to see the Hollywood Sign...,The Observatory at Griffith Park and it is free so good value...:-) Parking there can be tiresome but doable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ceelle
30,Travel guru,"The hollywood sign is a bit of a challenge to get to as you meander through very tight windy streets, once you get to the gates of the road access you have a few choices, you can walk up a dirt road and from there have good visualization of the sign, you cannot get to the actual Hollywood sign as its blocked so the best is from a distance, you will also have a good view. Of the valley below up to the ocean. I did not use the other access where. I think there might be horse riding and a restaurant. If you park outside the gates and walk up then there is no costs to reach the top of the hillside. It makes a nice hike, bring water. The hike is steap and not for people suffering with heart problems or other ailments. Its a hillside dirt trail, avoid going if it rained or will be raining. There. Is also view access from. An Observatory close by in case the main road is closed. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DIDIERGOLF
30,Just big dirty off white letters,Bit disappointed very few places to see it from I thought hollywood sign would be the great thing to see but it's not,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlairwithF
50,Fame in the Air,Hollywood Sign hike is not only good place to hike but also one of the best places to find inspiration or motivation. Yeah you probably heard about several people jumping from the letters but lets be positive. Area is amazing and quiet. I love this trail to hike cuz once you get there you have an amazing view of the Whole LALALAND! strongly suggesting this place to visit. If you came to LA and never been to Hollywood sign count that as you never been to LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570leonardoc
30,Legendary attraction,"We drove north on Gower Boulevard until we could get as close as we could. Taking pics of the sign and taking pictures of the sign is you saying ""I did it."" You'll be able to see it at various locations throughout Hollywood. I just wished we could have gotten closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emsems2015
20,I Don't Get it! BORING.,"I truly have never understood this one. The first time I saw it, and every time I still see it, I wonder what is the big deal? What you see up close is a sign that needs maintenance and it's the same thing you see from a distance. It just has a blah‚Ä¶ ""Is that all there is?"" reaction in me. It's not a destination, it's a big sign! You can see it from many points in LA so why drive up to it? B-O-R-I-N-G",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelSecrets78
30,Iconic but just a sign,"Hey if your in the city you will want to get a photo of this sign, who wouldn't.You can't get really close to it and oddly it's not lit up and night so get your pic in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkeeler99
50,A must do,"Visit the Hollywood sign for some great views of LA and also some great pictures of you and this famous landmark. The sign can be viewed from multiple locations around LA however the best view for us is from Lake Hollywood Park or Canyon Park drive. Grab a sat nav and take the short journey (from Hollywood) up to the sign. The roads can get narrow and bendy in places, but once you are up at the sign it opens up and you can easily park.Lake Hollywood Park is also just around the location and also offers good views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MQ85
30,Fun stop for the kids,"We found a great park to visit to not only see the sign and take a few photos, but it gave us a chance to play and run around too. Yes, it is just a sign, but a very iconic sign that the kids were excited to see. To us, it was worth the 30-45 minutes of our day that it took to experience this sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlustfamily17
20,Just a sign...,"The only good part is you can say you have been there and took some pictures. If arrive at an early time you there are no buses with tourists.For me it is just a sign, ok it is there since a while and you see it in movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crumbs73

30,Beware of limited parking and the warning!,"So living in CA all my life never visited the Hollywood sign, although I have seen it for years. My work in video required me to get a quick shot of the sign. First it is in a residential neighborhood, not really clearly marked for getting there. Once you arrive below the sign you are faced with limited parking options and restrictions, all to make your visit most uncomfortable! Tour buses will be there as well, on a tight road. So you want to get a picture or video? Good luck as soon as you get anywhere near the actual sign, climbing up a treacherous, (if you love hiking unmarked dirt trails, disregard), dirt mountain, you will get the rangers to get on the public address system to say something to the effect ""we are going to arrest your!"" Get a nice shot when you can a don't waste your time actually visiting the sign, much better things to do!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371brucec
40,"""THE"" Sign","Well, you can see it afar off, if you know in what direction to look. We happened to be coming down Gower Street and got the first glimpse. So we just rode toward it and finally asked someone on the street. They did not tell us about a walking trail that I see in some of the pictures, nevertheless we were told where to go to get a better view of it. It was a bit hard to get a picture because the traffic was steady. I assume people just like us trying to get as close as they could. I got several shots of it, just for memory purposes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/129michelleh
30,Just do it once,Let's face it this is an iconic sign that you should get a picture of. Lots of different places to get a great shot. So do a selfie!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chiefly1
50,You can't go to LA and not go to the sign,"I definitely recommend this visit at least once. You get the most beautiful view of the city. I recommend a good camera if you want to zoom in close, but it's not needed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660ericar
30,Too far :(,"Unfortunately, you can get close to the sign. As for the view point - it is too far to get a good picture. Anyway it worth to go there, I think.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7100PW_
50,Obligatory photo!,What a drive up but well worth it just to get 'that photo' ..... A must for the album.Expected it to be busier so had hassle free experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCliveR
50,"Ah yes, the sign, the big white sign overlooking Hollywood.","We are lucky to still have the sign. It fell into a state of disrepair and the LA authorities wanted to pull it down. The Hollywood movers and shakers said nope, we will repair it and pay for it, you keep your grubby hands off it, this sign is Hollywood and all it stands for! Today the sign is protected and you can't actually get close to it anymore. There are some fantastic photo opportunities from the second floor of the shopping mall on Hollywood Blvd. You have got to take some pics of the sign, it defines Hollywood and is probably the most famous sign in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephencball
40,you have to it it once,worth a visit as it's such a lovely view on the hills. You can't get up close and personal to the sign but it's good to see. You'll need a good camera to get a decent picture as telephone pictures are just too small being too far away,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bernie680
40,A very pleasant experience,A very nice walk from Griffith observatory to the Hollywood sign. Perfect mood for joggers and family. The weather was beautiful and warm. The view is tremendoialy beautiful overlooking most of Los Angeles city,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoy555
30,Make sure you bring a telescope,"Look, it's LA, this is a must do attraction, but only because of where it is and all that.Unless you have a high zoom camera you are not going to get a good shot. Lots of roads are closed and getting close unless you have some local knowledge is out of the question.Tour buses won't take you up there and parking is not abundant. We drove, but could not find a road which would get us closer even using maps GPS etc.Go there. Take a photo say "" we are in Hollywood"" leave.The end.10/10 would squint again to see the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaunG203
40,In. November,My husband and I were on our Honeymoon in November 2014. We got a great few of the sign from the Griffith observatory. You could do two things at once. It's a great few from up there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013
30,too hard to get close,"Yes, it is must see sign and take picture, but the neibourgs do not agree. Too many aods are closed. The buses and vans cant go anywhere close. You need good zoom in to you camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DosLeones
50,Don't even think of missing this!,"It's history, and it's likely the most well known sign in history. You can see it right from the Hollywood Walk of Fame or you can drive up Mulholland Drive to the Hollywood Bowl Overlook to get a great view of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/framemanusa
50,Outstanding views,The Hollywood studios sign is a must see from the top is unmissable simply for the amazing a views and seeing all the beautiful houses at leading to the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionah308
50,Hike to the Hollywood sign,Parked our car in one of the lots at Bronson Canyon. Easy access to the trails from there. Super close view of the Hollywood sign. Awesome 6+ mile hike with great views of LA. Take plenty of water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rgil81
30,"Good for the photo, don't take a tour","Agree with others, if you drive towards the sign you can find a street and snap a quick picture. Was there in Jan 2015 and access is ""closed"" but if you wind around the streets you can get pretty close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomHNJ
40,Dodge the traffic to shoot th sign,"Just below the sign is a residential neighbourhood where most people end up after a bit ofdriving around.It is funny to see folks, including myself and my wife, running into the middle of theroad, camera or I-phone/Pad in hand to get ""The Shot "" Remember, this is Hollywood.Not as bad as it sounds as this is a residential street, not a LA Freeway.If you are in LA, or nearby, you have to do this at least once.And it's free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbE8998FX
40,Getting Close,It ihard to get close to the sign. i haven't after several tries. It is certainly an icon of Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/571mariel
50,An Icon,Had the pleasure to see the sign in person rather than on television. Made the drive during a trip to Las Vegas. I was not disappointed. It took about 10 minutes to find the right street to get the best shot. It also helped to have a camera with a zoom lens! Didn't make sense to pay for a tour to see the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/954francesa
30,Fun for the picture,"Challenge to find the right spot to take a good picture to pretend you are lifting the Hollywood sign. But once found, parking is easy, as you end up in residential area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyR956
40,Go take a picture and take a nice walk.,Go take a picture and take a nice walk. If it is a nice day it is great to drive part of the way and then walk up to the sign. The view is great and there are lots of nice houses on your way. Great for all agaes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaw677
50,A must see,"You can see the sign from many different places in L.A. The most interesting part was when we were told by tour guide that it was going to be torn down (many years ago) and Alice Cooper paid $75 USD for a letter and then other celebrities etc. paid for the other letters. That was interesting. you can't go to LA without having a look at the sign but you don't have to head up to see it, you can see it from downtown LA too... if you are quick when driving past certain locations",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TK20132013
30,"It's just a sign, but try seeing from North Beachwood dr.","We wanted to get a pic of the iconic Hollywood sign but without bothering to get so close. My tip: go to North Beachwood Drive, the northern half or so, and you can get good pics from there (even a smartphone camera produces reasonable results but a camera with zoom is better).As you'll see, the best place to take that shot is likely to be from the middle of the road, so please be considerate to the locals and other drivers. One of us kept a lookout for cars while the other was taking the shot. We saw others just creating a nuisance by standing in the road forcing drivers to swerve around them.There's a cheap shuttle bus up and down the road which stops every maybe 200m or so. The fare was only 50c and TAP payment was 'coming soon'.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjb1001
40,Must do,If possible get as close to the sign as you can. A lot of places in the city offer a good view of the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sj1991
50,Long hike but worth the effort,"Visiting the sign can be a bit challenging as you firstly have to know the best way to covertly get there. All the roads leading up towards the hills are closed and off limits to visitors with Police and security everywhere. You will face arrest (http://www.hollywoodsign.org/seeing-the-sign/why-cant-i-hike-to-the-sign/). So beware. If you do manage to skirt things, the hike is a fairly long one, taking about an hour up moderately steep hills. (Beware of the rattlesnakes). Once on top, you'll get great views if the air is clear and of course an easier walk down - but hard on the knees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847ca
40,"It is just a sign , but one of the most famous in the world","If you are not interested , don't go . It's as simple as that . You can see the sign from many areas in LA . The address given on Tripadvisor is a great spot . There is a park here and not only do you get a good view of the sign , but also behind you looking over the LA basin towards the ocean .There is no access to the sign itself , so we are satisfied with the view from here . Be aware of where you park . There was a friendly parking enforcement officer when we were taking pictures . As long as you aren't poking out onto the road or parked beside a fire hydrant you will be fine . We were thereon Christmas day and it was hectic .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skwiki
50,BIG,The sign is huge and there's a couple ways to get close...drive up into the hills through neighborhoods or hike to it from the arboretum! It's worth seeing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyi772
10,Famous but can't get close to it,You can see the sign from the streets of La so I wouldn't pay toGo up and see it. You can't get close to it at all because it's privately owned. The most interesting part was discovering a celeb died off the letter H,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alyssssymarie1990
40,Iconic Sign,"Great to view from the observatory or by hiking up to the sign.Just beware of the neighborhoods that you park in. They are all very nice, but the residents are up in arms because of tourists that park on their public roads to access public land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aarond712
10,Nothing wonderful about it,It's best to not have high expectations on the Hollywood sign. It's just a sign and the most you can do is take a picture with it. Besides that there is nothing special about this spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alecast29
50,Its not just about the Sign !,"Many people drive up the this iconic symbol of Hollywood and are dissapointed. But the Hollywood sign is not just about the sign. It is located atop a hill in the hollywood hills with one of the best views from the Pacific Ocean to Downtown Los Angeles and beyond. That is the Value of the Hollywood Sign. Yes, it's just a sign, but the beauty of Los Angeles from the Hollywood sign is fantastic and worth the drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffh116
30,It's a sign and it says Hollywood on it?,"If you're a Hollywood fanatic then this might just be the sign for you. Otherwise, not so much? Go climb Runyon Canyon Park Trail and view from there . . . get OFF THE COUCH! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalGold
30,It is what it is,"I found viewing of the Hollywood sign underwhelming, and I also had low expectations to begin with. It is what it is...just a sign, so maybe it would be more exciting for some people who are really excited to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bguth11
50,It's as good as you think!,"We tried to follow advice from other reviews on how to see the sign up close but they didn't really work. We drove and drove and drove all through side streets in the hills and we somehow found the golden spot! It seemed like a pretty private street and is kind of narrow so keep that in mind when you come. We came from Franklin Ave and turned onto N Beachwood Drive. Follow Beachwood until it looks like you can't go any further (there are park guards blocking you from going straight) and then turn right onto Hollyridge Drive. After about a minute on Hollyridge, you will understand what I mean by the best view of the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990christinag
40,Rising to the top of Hollywood...,I did....well at least to the huge sign which says it! Wish I could do such in the movie/fame department.Anyway I would advise to take one of those tour bus than your car. I went there with my mates in a hired car and it was a pain in the neck getting there since the road leading to Hollywood(sign) is one unbelievably bumpy & steep ride....no pun intended! Ample amount of free parking available.Once we reached there...that was it and awkward cricket sound settled in as there's nothing to do there...usually dead quiet. Luckily for us there was a tour bus with guide showed up and we freeloaded with his crew learning a bit of history behind the sign and surrounding area of LA.At least you get a nice panoramic view for LA...photo/selfie opportunity galore with those fake smiles with added victory/peace/heart symbols using one's hand. Recommended visit is before sunset with any LA guided tours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/827azizs
40,"Wanted to hike, but ended up with pics from scenic drive","We wanted to hike, but the Deronda road was closed to traffic by park rangers. We had heard most of the prior access points were also closed off and we didnt have the time to hike from Griffith Observatory. The Scenic Drive has a few great spots for picture taking and served their purpose. Spotted the sign a few times later from the highway, the Hollywood Mall and while walking along Hollywood Strip as well. Glad we were able to see it...kids were psyched to see it an take their selfies...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffpags

A lot easier and more convenient!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom131288
40,The iconic sign,"We used another reviewers advice and went up Derondo drive. We went as far in the car as we could but didn't drive past the cones that was put up, out of courtesy from the residents. You can walk up a little and you get the best view. You are so close to the sign, closer than the tours. It was amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/500davea
40,Checked off my bucket list,"I see it as one of those must-see for tourists even though it's nothing really special when you're up close to it but it was worth the time to see it and you can either hike up there or drive.

40,Do a hiking!,"Get up early, dress up and enjoy a beautiful climb with magnificent views of LA and the Valley. Less people, no worries with parking and a really close look to one of the most recognizable sites in the planet. Lots of lovely people on the tracks. Do a online search to find maps and routes. I did the Wonder View drive track and found it easy to climb. There were children and people with dogs too, so it should be ok if you are not terrified of heights. Don't forget to stop by the Wish Tree to write down your votes.Oh, and it's FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShigueS
30,Closed!,"We attempted to go up to the sign but because of the recent dry weather there was too much fire risk.

30,Something to Tick off the List,"An Iconic sign my husband and i had been seeing in movies. We always wanted to see the sign.

30,A bit underwhelming,"You really don't know until you get to Hollywood just how far away the sign is from all the best viewpoints.People use a trick with cameras where the photographer stands about 10-20 feet away and zooms up on you with the Hollywood sign in the background. This gives the illusion that you're close to the Hollywood sign. The best viewpoint was at Griffith Observatory, followed by the Highland Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTravellerABC123

40,The sign is awesome!,"The sign is awesome! There is parking underneath the sign but alas I could that close as the area was closed off for private event, but the sign was visible from where I was.The other place to see the sign clearly from is Hollywood & Highland Center or Griffith observatory. The worst thing about the sign was, its owned by a private company so they don't turn the lights on at night and its not possible to see the sign at night if you are visiting these places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSurahyo
10,Never made it :o(,"We booked a tour to go there, but never made it. We did Rodeo Drive, it was okay, nothing special.

30,Not essential,"It's worth doing if it's part of something else, i.e. a bus tour of LA or if you want to head to the Griffith Observatory. You get a decent view from up there but unless you've got a great camera, it won't come out all that well in photos. There are some great views of LA from the Observatory so it is still worth a visit. Time it when the Observatory is open though (closed on Monday's) to make the trip up there worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FeeJegs
40,Be a tourist,"You're there, so why not get a good shot of the sign?

30,Worht a look ?,"Well don't go driving up to the hills expecting to stand right in front of it. Its fenced off, and man is it along hike to get to it. Best bet is to go to Griffith Observatory, park in the car park and look back at the hills and there it is.

It is definitely one of the things to do; but once you've done it, not exciting enough to go back a second time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/694margiel
40,Hard to get too,We traveled up this huge hill that led to the Observatory but when we reached the top we still didn't see the sign. But as we were going back down the hill you can see it. It was beautiful. Never go on a late weekend day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M8873BFstephaniec
40,Hard to get the perfect picture on tours,We went on several LA tours but none that we selected seemed to have a perfect view of the Hollywood sign. Of course everyone wants to get that perfect picture of the famous sign! I guess the best pics I have were from a stop in Beverly Hills where I took a pic through an intersection and at the Hollywood Sign overlook on Mulholland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
50,Hike to the Holkywood sign,"It's a moderate to strenuous 2 hour, 7-mile round trip hike on a partially paved, wide fire road that is well maintained. Park your car in one of the lots at Bronson Canyon for easy access to the trail.Once at the top, you will be above and behind the Hollywood Sign. A fence and security cameras keep people from actually getting close to the sign. But you get really close. And on a clear day, you can see all the way to downtown L.A. and beyond to the Pacific Ocean.Those of you interested in 60's and 70's TV shows, make sure you take the short trail from the parking area to see the Bronson Caves---one of which is better known as the ""Bat Cave"" from the TV show starring Adam West.By the way, the ""bathroom"" is a porta-potty in the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbaldwinl
30,A Popular Icon,"Almost everyone who comes to Hollywood is drawn to the iconic ""Hollywood"" sign in the Hollywood hills. They have a desire to get as close as possible but thats not very close these days. In fact although there is a hiking trail that passes at the bottom of the hill it still does not pass very close and the residential streets nearby are populated by frustrated residents who are not friendly to tourist trespassing. So I suggest you find a nice place in Hollywood where you can get your pictures at a distance. In any case you have bragging rights that you were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettP775
30,Do it to say you did!,"Once you start driving toward Hollywood the sign is visible and there's a sort of excitement but honestly you can only stare at a sign for so long or take a few pictures in front of it before it becomes boring. We actually tried to get close to the sign but there are no roads that lead directly to it. Also, for you ""selfie"" people out there, the closer you get the larger it gets so you may not be able to get it all in the shot.My suggestion for a decent picture not only of the sign but also for a beautiful shot of LA as well as something else to do is to view it from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THE-TW0-BEES
40,Must visit,"Good scene, take your picture and experience the narrow road up to the hill :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/793tianx
50,Hooray,"Its an iconic landmark and we have viewed this from many locations, the Griffith Observatory, Hollywood & Highland mall, even had a hotel room view of the sign.It tells you where you are, it might seem cheesy but this is Hollywoodland and the first glimpse of it got our kids excited!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
30,It's just a sign,"Okay, I get it. It's a world famous landmark. But that's all it is. Yes, this is HOLLYWOOD!! The town that has turned embellishment into an art form. The sign is a must see, but don't expect to see anything more than a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23Feb45
50,Great Sign,"I love going to it. I can see it from my son's bedroom far off. I like to take Beachwood, park and take the side streets up walking. The park at the bottom is I think Hollyridge, then another mile up. Nice hike. Spooky at dusk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graceland99
50,Best pictures are from the Observatory or Hollywood and Highland,An Iconic attraction! Just don't try to drive up to it. You will get a better view from the Griffith Observatory or Hollywood and Highland. Too close and you'll get a bad shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellboydquinnell
40,It's a big sign,"It's a sign. It says ""Holllywood"". You can see it from many places within the city and yes... it's kinda cool. No need to torture the local residents by trying to get up close to it. Really. You can't read the sign when you are that close and you are just trampsing around in a bunch of shrubs where there are rattlesnakes. Sometimes there are dead bodies up there. I am not lying.Best to just look up from your smart phone at some point and admire the sign from afar. It is iconic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsTravelJones
40,Legendary Landmark,"We hoped to do the Hollyridge trail to behind the Hollywood sign, however, since end of March 2014 the residents in the area have lobbied to close the trail and a guard sent us on our way in November, shame!I understand the residents don't want tourists traipsing around their property, however, I also wish a compromise could be made as the sign was there first and residents bought into the area!So, we made our way to Griffith Park and hiked part of the way to see it from below. The heat (unseasonably warm, mid 90's) kept us from making the full journey and the Hollyridge trail would have been much easier. Alas it was not to be.A great landmark and must see ... we loved the Hollywood Hills area and got a good view, albeit not the one we wanted.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindsay-and-Neil
30,TA Overrated,"People make too much of this sign, however iconic it may be. Admire it from afar and move on. It originally was an advertisement for a subdivision called Hollywoodland, I.e. crass commercialism. You've been had!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,That sign that's in so many movies,We saw the sign as close as we ever will from a coach tour of Beverly Hills and surrounds. It seemed smaller than movies suggest but it was great to see it set in the Hollywood Hills for real.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Candysroom1234
30,"Got to see it, at least once","When visiting Los Angels in 2006 we made sure that we stopped and took a picture of this landmark. We did not drive up to it, but stopped on the side of the road with a clear view of it. It is quite big and worth at least getting a glimpse to say you have seen it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/redrn13
40,The Big H,Hard to review such an iconic landmark. I jumped the fence with a friend and snapped photos of the trespass. We knew the camera was watching us so we didn't dawdle. Fun time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktown1969
50,Iconic HOLLYWOOD Sign,"Even with so many trips to LA, shooting the right photo of the Hollywood sign becomes a quest! So, does the trek to the sign. Great photos from the Griffith Observatory - the vantage point at almost the same level as the sign is terrific! Although the drive through the Hollywood Hills is much more fun to get to Mount Lee. Recommend researching the Hollywood sign to understand the history and get a glimpse of a window to the past.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
30,Not thrilling from the Mulholland Drive scenic stop,Too far away to really appreciate it. Hope we are back again sometime soon to have as much fun as others who have posted. Nice view of the city from this viewpoint.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TFry55
40,A classic if you are in LA,"It need to be part of your pictures, a classic if you are in LA. Best place to take pictures is by Mt Lee Dr.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steeprock
40,Tricky to get to but worth it,If you want a great picture you need to drive through Hollywood Hills to get there. The drive is over some twisting roads through a residential area that can be very tricky so go slow. The view once at the top is breathtaking not only of the Hollywood sign but of the city below and the mountains in the distance. Lots of great photo ops. Look for the giant eggplant sculpture if you want a quirky extra in your shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742jillv
50,Danced beside the Hollywood sign,"You need to be adventurous finding this. Theres a park in the area by it, just keep going up the winding roads. We walked up a small hill after parking and looked to the right and there was the D. Awesome, it was also so wonderful because we were also looking over LA at sunset. Best part of my trip, Ill never forget it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherylmp62
20,You just can't get to it,"The road to it is closed due to construction of a new residential neighborhood (boo) so you're sent from there to Griffith Observatory for your picture taking. I'm sure there has to be another way to get to it, we just weren't that adventurous. Take the time to figure it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksondc
50,An absolute must see in LA,"This is one of the most iconic and recognizable signs in the world. There is definitely some magic about it. It's really hard to grasp what exactly makes so strong impression, but once you see it, you'll definitely remember it.There is so much complexity when you see those 9 letters. It's a busy crowded city below, a desert rock with some green trees against always blue California sky with a sign made with the letters which look monumental from far away, but become thin decorations when you get closer ... There are so many symbols mixed in that message and it's been on so many minds and in so many dreams ...There are a few ways to experience it.You can catch a glimpse when you drive on Hwy 101 - better than nothing, but not by much.If you want to get to the letters, the roads are closed now, so you need to park at the Griffith Park and take a trail from there. It could take a couple hours or so and it's a decent hike, but ironically it won't give you the best view because the sign won't be facing you.My favorite spot is to go along N. Beeckwood Dr for about a mile north from Hollywood Blvd. This is a nice straight street which opens up right to the sign. There is usually some free street parking and it's very walkable, so you can enjoy some walk and take great pictures against the sign with some palm trees, blooming floors and other iconic Hollywood features. If you make it to Beechwood cafe - it's a really Hollywood classy place to take a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heckfy
50,Great for walking!,"Drove up there, getting a parking spot is really hard. Walking up to the holliwood sign is great, you got yourself a long walks before getting up there. Could be a good view of L.A but It was foggy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/198MichelleF
50,Must see in LA,"It was the first thing we looked out for when we were driving from LAX and there it was, in the distance, just amazing to see. Such an iconic landmark and yes it is clearly visible from many, many vantage points around LA they are really lucky to have something so simple yet well known as a landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MEPlatt
40,Iconic,Had to take a little detour to get close but was worth the effort .Its just something you have to do when on the tourist trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/den-rick71
40,Do the hiking there,The Take the trail to the Hollywood sign. It's worth making the trail that runs through the hills of the notice. Nature and the view of the place are amazing.It doesn't take too long.,
50,Real estate can't be more iconic!!!,"What it started as a real estate sign for advertising the area it turned into a ""must do"" within Los Angeles attractions.Such an iconic landmark it has to be seen if you love this kind of things. You can access via a full hike or in a shorter and faster way.The full hike starts on Canyon Dr. and it takes about 3hs the entire hike. It's not that steep so no need to be THAT in shape. The shorter one starts on the very end Deronda Dr and then you have to take Mt. Lee Dr and you can save about 2hs.Both routs are easy and very funny, you'll meet a lot of people with dogs or back horse riding, there are room for everyone.For the long hike it's better to go early in the morning (7:30 AM) for finding parking spaces, mostly if you are planning to go during the week end. The short one the parking are very restricted so be patient.On fall you may find some mist that will block the Los Angeles city views but it worth the hike anyway.Tip: take some water with you to keep you hidrated and remember do not littering.",
30,Iconic,"We took a bus tour which included a stop above the Hollywood Bowl and a walk up some steps to see the famous sign, and then on to see the stars homes from the road. It was really too far away to see much, but on a zoom you at least could read it! You can actually see it from a shopping centre up a few floors on the Hollywood Boulevard.But I guess when in Los Angeles you must see the sign!",
10,Disappointment,It was really disappointed the sign is really far away and it's hard to take a picture with the sign in the background all my family were disappointed,
40,A great place to take a break,"Took the family to LA for spring break and visited the Hollywood sign. There is a road which will take you to a dog off leash park directly beneath and about a mile from the sign (3000 Canyon Lake Drive). The park is large, pretty, and has a great view of the Hollywood sign for iconic pictures and also the reservoir and downtown LA. We visited Wilshire Boulevard with the fancy shops and beautiful palm drives, the Hollywood walk of fame, and La Brea Tar pits (All in close proximity). We then grabbed sandwiches and took a 15 minute drive for a long lunch break under the sign... For first timers to LA, it's an iconic must see. For those in the LA area, it's a private little nook to explore for a casual date or play with a friend. The road to the park is a little windy and goes through some residential areas but isn't a bad drive at all...",
20,Buy a Postcard,"My daughter lives below the sign, so i have had plenty of opportunities to study the sign, and its plain ugly!!!Why any one would make a special trip to photograph ugly letters spelling out HOLLYWOOD, is beyond me.Spend your time elsewhere!",
40,"Tourist trap, totally worth it","Fun to see this iconic sign in real life. I took a tour that stopped at the Hollywood Bowl lookout so i could get a photo with the sign in the background. You can't actually get up close to the sign legally, so you may have to get creative to get an up-close shot.",
30,Just a bucket list thing,"Its hard to see because of all those houses, its much smaller than expected and once I got there after a hike... theres nothing. Just a view over the city, the sign is behind a fence. I don't know, I'm just not impressed.",
20,Exactly What It Sounds Like,"It is a sign, on a hill. You can see it from basically anywhere in Los Angeles. Again, it is just a sign, on a hill.",
10,Overrated ridiculous tourist stop.,What is the point of hiring a rental car or a taxi to stand with your hand up with the Hollywood sign above you. If you must have a picture with the sign go to the corner of Schrader and Selma in Hollywood and use a long distance lens . That location is just one block from the other tourist trap.....the Hollywood walk of fame. Best yet forgo Hollywood and go to Santa Monica and walk on the beach.,
50,Great walk,"Lovely (uphill!), walk up adjacent to the Hollywood sign at griffith park. Wonderful view over The Griffith Observatory and the whole of LA ! Takes about two hours plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/goldieSydney
30,Not what I expected...,"When I viewed the Hollywood sign, all it's granduer was lost (I am hoping at the time it was just in need of a refurbishment). I guess I expected something larger than life, and I viewed it from afar. I probably had to be closer to the site to fully feel the effect of it's granduer! It was just OK to me. Maybe on my next visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luv2TravelwHim
10,Too far away :(,It's really too bad that an iconic symbol like the Hollywood sign will not allow tourists to get close to it. I understand why they have put up fences around it (people kept committing suicide in the 80's) but could they not at least build some sort of a lookout platform that is close enough to get a really nice picture? We went on a bus tour and ended up on Mulholland Drive. This is supposedly the best place to view the sign. What a waste of time. The sign is so small you can barely make it out in the picture (check out the attached photo). Don't waste your time or money on this unless you planning to hike (illegally) up to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J727YCkellyg
30,Good for a quick photo-op,"It's hard to get close to the Hollywood sign without guidance and IMO not worth spending a lot of time here, but it's an iconic photograph to show friends back home and it's completely free. Just set your GPS to ""Lake Hollywood Park"" and follow directions up some very narrow twisty streets into the Hollywood Hills. When you arrive at the park there are no facilities but plenty of free parking, you can take a photo with the sign as a backdrop, and there are few tourists. Mostly locals walking their dogs. An unexpected bonus is the view of the Hollywood Reservoir down below. If you are on a very tight budget, it would be more fun to stop at Subway and take a picnic up to the sign rather than settle for a grubby eatery on Hollywood Boulevard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinaAddict92
50,Hollywood Sign,"I would view the sign from the observatory instead. A magnificent morning hike, dogs on leash welcome. Go to Ferndale off Los Feliz Blvd. and drive north up into Griffith Park.Park anywhere you can find a spot and take the hike up to the Observatory. The hike is a great work out and once you arrive at the Observatory your mind will be blown at how gorgeous this city is! On a clear day you can see to the Pacific ocean from Palos Verdes to Santa Monica as well as Downtown and the"" Hollywood sign"". During these Fall months the views are pristine and glorious.After your done go and have a latte and some home made scones or lavender cookies at the Trails Cafe! You will be in heaven!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Treemac90
50,It's so iconic. What a great photo op!,"I think that making the trek out to get close to the sign is totally worth the effort. It's a great icon of L.A. and a picture of you standing under/in-front-of it makes for a great souvenir. The hike to the top of hill pays off with a great view of LA and the walk is on paved road; easy if you take it slowly, a great workout if you really hoof it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoFourTheRoad
10,There's nothing there!,"No parking, no bathrooms, no refreshments, nada!Go to Venice Beach or the Hollywood Walk of Fame.It's a better use of valuable vacation time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
40,Enjoyed the walk,We took a nice walk up to the Hollywood sign to see how close we could get to it. We enjoyed the stroll and got to take some good pictures - its another must do in Hollywood. Walking gets you so much closer than any car or bus and the views are incredible. It'll take a few hours if you're taking your time but its nice to enjoy and relax. There wasn't any food places so be sure to take some lunch with you in case you get hungry. We also found a horse riding place on the way back down which would have been great! Worth a look around at that beautiful scenery,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022
20,Another waste of time,Why would I ever climb a hill to see some huge letters of the name of a town from very close? Go to the observatory and see it from there ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzalo_de_Berceo
50,A must hike!!!,You came all the way to LA and aren't going to hike up to the sign? Your crazy. It's a must hike with amazing views! Once you get to the top of the sign you never want to come down. Or leave LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kirstink3
50,Get close,"You need to get close to the sign to appreciate it in all its glory, the road ends at the base of the sign but there is now parking, We went really early and took a view shot and ppl were hiking up round the road to behind the sign. If you go early take a stop at the doggy walk park as its a famous place to see celebs. we saw simon cowell leaving as we got out our car. You also have a great view over Hollywood hills",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karluk29
40,Iconic sign,"The closest a car or coach tour can get to this is the stop at Mulholland Drive. This is miles away. If you want a better view then walk down the Hollywood Boulevard eastwards and you‚Äôll be able to see it. You‚Äôll also be walking down the Walk of Fame, so it‚Äôs a 2 for 1 plus won‚Äôt cost you anything. Going with a tour is disappointing. You can walk someway towards it although I didn't do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadowed-raven
10,Second honeymoon,Dears u have to see it...u r in hollywood..and u need to take this picture!!!After all its only a sign..and every movie u will see in the future and this sign is in it..u will remember that one day in the past u passed by here ;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ziadj_13
40,Iconic photo opportunity,"Yes it's just a sign, but what were you expecting?We took 30 minute trip up to the Hollywood sign, and enjoyed the opputunity to take some photos with the iconic sign. No trip to LA would be complete without a photo of the Hollywood sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonlol
30,just a sign,"How can you not stop and look at it and take some pictures. Our first visit to Hollywood, read other reviews about the great dog park viewing area. Well worth it for your memento photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squish68
40,That sign you want to see..,"If you want to have an unobstructed 'closer' view of the sign without a lot of crowd and restrictions, drive to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive Los Angeles. There is an open area with some vehicles parked around a road turn and that is the place. Its easy, just put this address in GPS and go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gunjan_Indrayan
40,Do Not Go When It Gets Dark - You Won't See It!,"It's iconic. It's LA. It's Hollywood. It does not light up at night. As such, if you want to take a picture, you need to put on a GPS and do so during daylight hours; then carefully wind your way thru the narrow, local busy streets. Once there snap a picture or two. Not much more than this to tell about a sign - but as a tourist, it should be on your ""must do"" list. (Don't forget, in the Fall/Winter it does get dark early - be there well before sunset, otherwise you will be most disappointed.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorNewJersey
20,What's the hype about a sign?,"Was at the canyon dog park with my friend walking his dog and we came to where you have an unobstructed view of the sign. I just don't get why folks go crazy over a sign that you can't even get close to to take a picture. I was a tourist but seeing the Hollywood sign was just not a big deal for me. Maybe next time when I visit LA again, I might try to go the the observatory and see if its a great view. More than likely I wont.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LINDSAYH559
50,Finally got to see the iconic sign,"I know it's just a sign, but it's such an icon of images from movies and television. It was fun to see in person and, of course, we all had to take a picture. This was our first visit to the Hollywood area and I found the history of the sign to be very interesting since it started out as a simple advertisement sign from the 1920's for the neighborhood ""Hollywood Land."" We did learn that there was a recent discovery of another sign by hikers nearby. It was apparently overtaken by vegetation, but was originally a nicer sign that the icon we now know. Not sure how much truth there is to that rumor though. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit just to see it in person. The streets are narrow and winding, so make sure you plan your route or go with someone that knows the area. There is a dog park near a nice viewing area on Mulholland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soonersports
30,Its a sign,"A big sign that says 'Hollywood'. what more is there to see??found a good view from some street (sorry forgot the name) that was near a dog park. unobstructed views.spent all of 2 mins there, taking a picture from the car and then leaving. not much more to do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryguytpt
40,Look,"The famous Hollywood sign, which started its life as a cheesy promo for a housing development called Hollywoodland, makes a great backdrop for a photo, but little more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
40,Go to the dog park for viewing.,We found that the views from the dog park were pretty good and dogs were fun to watch. Parking was decent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodster117
40,Hollywood Sign,It is always exciting to see whether for the first time or the tenth. Reminds you of newsreels and scenes of movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailFitzpatrick
40,Iconic.,One of LA's 'must-see' attractions. Not bad for something that started off life as a real estate advertising sign! Lots of places around the city where you can see it. My bet is that no LA tourist goes home without a photograph of it. No real need to get close to it. It just gets a bit bigger the closer you get and you can't really get right up to it anyway. Click and move on!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL
30,The Hollywood Sign,"Well if you think that you can get up close to this sign you are very much mistaken.After winding through back streets and narrow roads, you find that there is no road that can get you up close and personal to the Hollywood sign. I was disappointed, but that's life isn't You can get better photos of the sign from the bottom of the hill. that's all i have to say about that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sue20132014
40,Iconic Photo Op,"You can't get very close to it. We tried but even with the hike through the LA Canynon park we were still 1/2 mile away. Also, it's hazy in the mornings and your photos aren't very good on smoggy days. But it's a cool part of history and you really need to go there if you are in LA. *Tip* Take the 1 hour horseback ride at Sunset Ranch to get a great view of a sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DothanEvents
40,First stop in LA,This was our first stop after picking up our rental car. Easy to find and nice drive up the mountain. Great view of the city and only need to be there for a short stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieng0911
50,Dawn hike,This is a must see when in LA.Best way personally is a very early start t4.30am then a drive / walk up the maze of roads that take you to just underneath to the right of the sign where the road enters the national park. its still about 400m away but this is as close as you will get to then take photos when dawn breaks. The view behind you over down town LA is then amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/78ChrisS78
50,Awesome!!!!,"This is the most famous sign in the world! Everybody around the world know this. If you are going to Los Angeles, you need to will be there and take a lot of pictures. Enjoy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodrigoJacinto
30,You must visit!,"It is one fo the worlds must do/see! it can be quite a walk if you don't have a car to get close, but I will remeber every step along the way, it was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andlufds
50,view,what a view!!!!! as you are driving up to the location the mountains are just right in your face. they are so breath taken beautiful. i would recommend this attraction to all,
40,Interesting for the novelty,"We put the address for Griffith Observatory in our GPS and parked just down the hill from the observatory. Then we hiked (yes hiked) up to a road we could've just walked on from the beginning (oops). But once we got there, the views were great! Heading up the hill to the observatory, there are two roads to the right that kind of V off the bottom of the hill. The right arm of that V will take you to these views and to a view of the sign. The novelty of it was fun, but we didn't spend long here.",
50,Must have seen in LA,We came here without an idea how to reach the sign. We just drove up the hills and finally we got it. Pretty hard to get very close to it. But there is are nice running tracks around the sign.,
40,Loved it!!,Did a tour of the movie stars homes and part of it was being taken to the sign and it was just great to see seen it so many times in the movies to see it in real life was amazing.....,
50,Iconic view,"It was not easy to find a good spot to view the sign, as the roads were blocked due to ""road work"" - even though we couldn¬¥t see any work. We decided to park the car at Mulholland Hwy and walked ¬Ω mile to a good viewing point. Signs said that it was not allowed to hike to the signs - but not necessary as we had a fine view from the distance.",
40,An Iconic must do.,"When in LA, you have to see the iconic Hollywood sign and have your picture taken with it in the background. It is just one of those must do things.We found that the best vantage point to view the sign was from the Griffith Observatory, free parking and also great viewpoints.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nsmith50
40,Must See,"So yeah, it's a sign. However, to us, it is an icon and something that you have to see once in your life. We had a tour with LA Inside and Kevin took us to a cool residential spot to check it out. We were the only ones there for most of the time. You probably can't appreciate it as a local, but as an east coast family, we loved the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scranton38
40,The drive to see the sun is a fun place to go,"Went up to see the sign for something to do. The views were great and I was surprised at how large the sign actually was, there were plenty of places to stop and pull over and look and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
40,"You can't go TO the sign, but you cant miss it!","The sign overlooks the entire Hollywood valley and is the most iconic landmark in LA without question. Most people think you can actually go to the sign itself, well you can, but it takes some hiking and I'm not even sure it's legal! Ha. However, there are plenty of roads through the hills to roam and get close and some amazing shots.I remember prior to the Hollywood/highland center being built, it was more difficult to find that perfect shot... But if you want the easy route, then just go there now and you can take all kinds of pics! :-)Anyhow, it's the one thing everyone who travels here needs to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleOIncognito
50,A must-see at least once in your lifetime,"It's all just a big photo opportunity, and not much to 'do' per se. But definitely a must-see in your lifetime just to see the iconic sign and say you've been to ""Hollywood"". Great views along the way for a scenic drive, and nice driveby looking at the different houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_JoanneRS_808
50,Awesome experience,"Amazing to just turn around and look up at the hills and see this iconic sign. We stayed in Hollywood so had distant views of it the whole time. We got a taxi up to griffith observatory to get a closer look (about $15 for 4 people from hollywood boulevard) . Got some great photos. You can hike from there to get closer but we didnt as I was pregnant and it was too hot, would have loved to have got a closer look.The only dissapointing thing about the sign is the story as to how it became what it is today very under whelming",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BUSHMCLOVIN
50,cultural icon on mount lee,"Expected to just see an old familiar sign. But, what a treat. Drove up north beechwood drive and got my first glimpse of the sign. I got so excited I pulled over and started taking pictures!!!! Ledgewood drive to Mulholland highway is another close up view. Mulholland highway to canyon lake drive has an area to park and take great selfies and photos. Originally the sign read hollywoodland for a real estate development that never materialized. Was very disappointed I could not find a T-shirt with the letters of the sign!!! Was surprised how much I enjoyed this sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodar21
40,Several options for seeing this iconic sign,"This sign is such an icon that everyone wants to see it at least once. We tried to drive to the closest lookout point near Mt Hollywood Drive but there is limited parking and they close the road when parking gets too full.Best place we found to see it was off of Mulholland Drive at the very first lookout point (Hollywood Bowl overlook). It's not the closest point, but you get a great view of the sign and the of LA.You can also see the sign from the H&H mall at the California Pizza patio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rlennon1
40,No trespassing,"Rode to top of drive. Not much parking. Didn't want to take the long hike up to the actual sign. Loved the curvy road and terrific, but small houses along the hillside. Very scenic drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELRICH11
40,Iconic attraction...,"The sign is iconic! We saw it from the road, the town, and finally from the Griffith Observatory. Took 20 photos at least....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pomerols
50,HollyWood...Sign.....Must See....!!,"The only thing special about seeing the sign, is the fact that you are seeing the sign. It is well worth it, and lets face it, if you have been to LA, everyone will ask if you saw the Hollywood sign. It's a cool thing to do, so just do it and enjoy yourself",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neeravs2014
50,In LA -must go.,Iconic so had to check it out. Read on here about an address on Deronda Drive but we somehow took a wrong turn and ended up at Scenic Overlook and was pleased with that view. If in LA just need a quick stop to take some great pictures and move on. We weren't interested in climbing the trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinad2010
50,Awesomeness!!,"I took the tour hollywood star tour, whereby it was about 1 hour touring around the houses of the holly wood stars. You get to see posh houses in the hollywood itself, crossing over to brevely hills too! If i remember, it cost about US$ 47/ pax. That includes the Madame Tussade tour ( wax museum). Go for the roofless van, which is non- air condition. You get to feel more of hollywood. Unless you are afraid of the sun, they do have with the A/c.I enjoyed myself. I got up to the peak to catch a glimpse of the Hollywood sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flowerymae
30,La la land,"If you're hiking up to see the sign like we did, have a look on Google earth before you go. There are a couple of forks with no signs (on the trail we took), and you don't really want to get lost up there. We took the brush canyon trail which took around 1.5 hours to walk up and about an hour to get back down. We were knackered! We underestimated the length and difficulty of the trail. It's probably a couple of miles long and fairly steep in places, and if you're not particularly fit it feels like a real workout. Having said that there are some brilliant views of the city on the way up, and also when you get to the top. The sign itself is pretty much what I expected: big and inaccessible. Was it worth it? I'm not sure that it was. I definitely wouldn't do it again and I'd only recommend it to people who really enjoy walking, or really really want to see the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helen261
40,What's a vist to LA without a trip to the sign?,"As the title suggests: what's a visit to LA without a trip to the sign? Unfortunately you can't actually get to the sign at the moment unless you take a bus from Griffith Observatory so the next best thing is to take a trip into the Hollywood Hills to get the best view possible. We went up Beachwood Drive and then cut across on very winding and narrow roads past some amazing houses on Rodgerton Drive (not recommended!) until we reached Deronda Drive. That took us to the Mulholland Highway, which we followed until we came to a lookout over the Hollywood Reservoir and behind us to the Hollywood sign. It's a broad good road so it's presumably the correct way to the sign, not our way. So, take Lake Hollywood Drive, then Tahoe Drive and Canyon Lake Drive. This will give you a good view of the reservoir and the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/295kathys
20,Meh !! Just a lot of hype !,"Meh !! Just a lot of hype !... Got sucked in, did a tour to see Hollywood sign, still from quite a difference...barren, scrazzy area..so disappointed. Got another view of it...which was a much nicer experience.... From Hollywood Boulevard. Opposite Il Cappitan Theatre.So forget the expensive tour.... Check it out from Hollywood Boulevard",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChezmossAustralia
50,Sign on the hill,"You don't have to go up the hill to see the sign, unless you want a great view of Los Angeles. The sign can be viewed from many locations along Hollywood Boulevard, but a great spot is the shopping centre at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard & Highland Avenue. The centre has been designed so you can see it from almost anywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdY6254YU
50,Love it!!,360¬∞ of amazing views and photo opportunities! ! Loved the parking area available so you don't feel rushed while taking your photos!! Definitely a must visit..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrissyjo2381
40,Hollywood Sign,"In all honesty, I wasn't very excited about seeing this in the Hollywood hills as I saw it as nothing more than a sign. I really enjoyed the drive towards the sign and I got some of the best photos of my holiday with my partner at the sign. Some great photo opportunities all over LA with the sign and it's really iconic for the LA city. I'd recommend driving up the hills and get yourself some once in a lifetime photos (certainly for myself being a Scotsman)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Begg_rfc
50,Come on...wot's not to like...,"We had a rental so life as rather easy...we got as close as we could...without getting banged up....so unless you are in Hollywood...it is probably a once in a lifetime thing,,,we had fun...xxx",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rkjlondon
50,A must see!,"We followed the directions from apple maps: 3204 Canyon Lake Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90068. And viewed the sign from the closest spot possible. Full sign view - the drive there was simple and enjoyable. Lots of good spots to take pictures. Teens were just excited of taking pictures - to them, this completed their visit to Hollywood! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aashpatel
30,Find a way to get to it easier,It's unfortunate that the only way to really get up close is to hike. For something that was a real estate sign which turned into something iconic they need to make it accessible for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradr879
20,Maybe it's just me,"I wasn't impressed. All the hype about seeing the sign, It's just a sign and driving up there with the amount of people that were there, I could just take a picture from afar. I've seen better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kat_r0d
40,Good to finally get to see it for real,Had a fun drive to get a close up shot of it. It was worth it. If you get the chance to see it you will want to get closer to it. It is a little hard to find the roads but it can be done,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bigo1952
40,The Hollywood Sign,"I had so much fun trying to get the perfect shot of the Hollywood sign. I did not seem to be alone in my quest either! I parked and found a path that seemed to lead me very close to homes, but I found a gap and got my shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisitout
50,Classic Photo-Op,You need to have a picture of yourself as close as possible to the Hollywood sign. That picture should be had by everyone. While we were up there we saw a photoshoot taking place which was neat. Its an extremely steep and winding road to get up if your driving yourself. Definitely worth the drive however. There is a dog park you drive past to get up the sign so if your traveling with your dog this is also a great opportunity for them to get out and run around. Also a lot of celebrities bring their dog there because its in the Hollywood Hills near their homes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bward27
10,We had to call a cab for stranded tourist!,"Another reviewer wrote that the small tourist vans that bring visitors to the Hollywood sign are subject to various regulations and that LAPD is cracking down and even impounding them. This is apparently true as a few days ago my husband and I rescued a young Russian woman who was left behind after dark. We called a cab for her and I'm guessing she paid $60-65 to get back to her hotel. She needed our help since most cell phones do not work in these hills. There are better, safer ways to see the sign such as the Griffith Park vans that take off from the Observatory. Cheaper and safer than the illegal vans that prey on tourists -- many of the latter constantly change names and operate without insurance. (If you don't believe that, ask to see their proof of insurance.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squirrelhillave
10,Illegal Van Tours to Sign,"Vans (even the small ones) to Lake Hollywood or Beachwood Canyon go there illegally. LAPD sets up stings regularly that weigh, impound and ticket. Tourists are left stranded in the hills. If you don't want to get stranded, make sure ahead of time you're not on a van that takes you this way. There are lots of other places to view the sign from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioAngelina
40,Amazing,"My husband and I drove to LA whilst on a recent trip to the US, we decided to go to the Hollywood sign as this is iconic and something that I had always wanted to see.We got lost and ended up in a street and when we turned to get back on the main road, it was there I couldn't believe it. Just staring back at us amazing..We drove up the road and unfortunately the road which the sign leads to was closed that day so we couldn't go up to the sign, we went as far as we could and took some great pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaH614

40,Decent,This sign is world wide know and we visited it today and it's nothing to write home about to be honest. It's good but not brilliant,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frasermorrison99
20,An overrated icon,"I think my disappointed with the Hollywood sign was that it didn't meet my expectations. It wasn't easily spotted from most locations in Los Angeles and even when I visited Griffith Observatory specially to see the sign, I was underwhelmed by how small the sign appeared and the distance. I think the media gave me an unrealistic view of the sign and seeing it in real life was very different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/550ryanl
50,AMAZING!!!!!,"I came to LA for my 30th birthday and the me thing I wanted to see, the Hollywood sign. All I will say is, it's fab, it's huge and it's Hollywood!A must see for all, stunning drive around the windy houses of the Hollywood hills. I wish I was back there now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MacyGriff
40,Amazing !!!,This was so great to see the amazing sign that as a family we could only have dreamt of seeing. We drove around for ages to get the best spot as the main route has been closed for some time. When we managed to find the viewing point it was great to see our children's faces when they could have their photograph taken with this iconic landmark,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBJ1703
50,Worth the hassle,"I visited January 2013I must say it is definitely quite the tourist attraction, but its worth the hassle. Well, if you a picture freak like e, its worth it. The parking is absolutely horrible. I'm almost positive I parked illegal for the 15 minutes it took for me to snap that ''perfect shot."" If you have the time to go early in the am, that would be your best bet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsGway2
40,You know you're in Hollywood!,"Driving in a convertible and viewing the sign means you made it ! Even from afar , you have your own postcard ! Relatives who live in LA could direct to where to park to find park trail. but you have to be willing to hike . Photo from afar was just as nice. Fun adventure several years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarilynJ473
40,"LA Style Worth it, but Kind Of Crazy","I walked to the Hollywood sign with my daughter and son-in-law who live in LA. Never could have done it without them and we parked in a ""secret"" place in a neighborhood then hiked up different road, through an unmarked door then finally got to the actual park trail. Read for another review to find out these secret ways to hike. But once onto the main park road, it was great -- no cars. I'm not much of a hiker so it got to be a little much, but all sorts of people were strolling back down so I stayed strong. Actually saw a perky little poodle on his way down --if the poodle could do it, I COULD DO IT. Anyway the Hollywood sign is much cooler from behind -- see photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MODSquadT4
30,See it from afar,"I wouldn't walk up or do any kind of physical activity to go out of my way to see this thing but you should at least try and notice it when you are driving around. Lots of cool history behind the sign, google them to add more interest to this sight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smileyeilidh
50,Just a sign but iconic,"Drive up Beachwood to find a good spot or best to walk it and stop at the cafe half way up.Google the best vantage point.Since there are many signs preventing folks from driving and parking, I am very surprised that no developer - my idea is for sale here haha - has yet build a rooftop viewing deck further north than what is currently available so the throngs of tourists can get a perfect, close shot of the sign without bothering the local neighborhoods. Seems like a idea well overdue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WelcomeMat
40,Walk up to it!,"Highly recommend walking up to the sign. I knew before getting to LA I wanted to walk up it. When I got to LA I asked around for the best route to take up. Everyone replied it was closed. Me being me ignored this got Google maps up on my phone and walked up the way Google suggested and had no problem. Using Google maps I highly recommend doing because Hollywood hills can be confusing at times when there's no reference point you can see so the GPS makes sure you don't make a wrong turn and have to backtrack.Its a pretty nice walk up, you gradually see the houses getting nicer and nicer as you incline. Pretty easy walk apart from the heat of California, so start the walk early. (We walked from Hollywood blvd)I'm going to give you the best tip you can get for the sign. When you get right up at the sign there's a fence in the way. So after having your look and you begin to head down, when you turn away from the fence as you follow the road turn left (left as your back is away from the sign). There should be a little dirt track go up there and it should bring you to face the sign again with a good view of it where you can lean over the fence and take some good photos with the sign. We where the only ones that did this, so its not busy there. When you're done just walk back where you came from to get back onto the road.After the sign I recommend walking to the Griffith Observatory. Pretty much a flat walk since you've already gained the hight. Also the Observatory is fee and a good place to look back where you've walked from. You can walk down a path at the Observatory or walk back where you came from. I suggest the Observatory one because its faster and a nice one, although fairly steep down, so make sure you have good footwear.Anyway the sign...yes highly recommend one of the few things I liked about LA because there wasn't many people doing the walk up to it (didn't see anyone until we got to the designated trail)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19Alexander92
50,The infamous sign...,"From Hollywood and Highland Center, the fourth floor is an excellent view. Also, from the left side of Vine near Capital Records just north of the Hollywood Blvd intersection. I really wish that they would legalize a simple way for everyone to get closer, but until then, the dirt trails seem to be the only way. We stuck the boulevard and just basked in her glory from afar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrpleasant
50,Must see,Trip to LA couldn't be complete without pictures of and with the sign! Griffith Observatory was our choice of viewing spot. Lovely day for it with good views of both the sign and the city. Bonus free parking and free observatory!! Win win,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatsnotmymonster
50,Sign up the mountain,"It was like impossible to get near to the Hollywood sign so we just took pictures on the street, can't remember the name, where the sign can be seen on photo. An ipad or iphone is applicable to take a photo with the sign appearing a bit big. A normal camera can take only an enlarged photo of the sign but will be in possible to include a person/s. It will either be too closed up or the sign will be very tiny.Getting near to the sign would need hiking up the mountain or at least a ride near to the place where hiking starts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeliaP_12

40,"Amazing view from 3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles","Okay, so I'm re-posting this address that I got in a previous review from here ( 3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90068.), I put this address in my GPS and it took me way up hill in a close location for great pics. It's a bit of a hassle to park around here, but once you do this is the spot! This is the street where tour buses take their guests, it's right under the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnaWQ
40,That perfect shot isn't easy!,"Finding the sign was surprisingly difficult from the street! I had to ask one of the guides at the Chinese Theatre where to best find the sign. Luckily, he pointed me to the location many mention on here (without wandering into residential areas) and was able to get a photo. However, it was SO far away, the photo with myself looks so strange! Thankfully, I was able to use a long lens on my DSLR to get a perfect shot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccabredin
50,More views than you know,"If you want to see this iconic sign, you must ask a local where they would go. It can be seen from the observatory at Griffith Park, or from behind off a canyon road of from several other vantage points.

50,Hollywood Sign - Like the View from Hollywood and Highland Center,"Since I grew up in LA, I always enjoyed seeing the Hollywood sign from different perspectives in the area. One of my favorite now is just to go to the higher outside walking area at the Hollywood and Highland Center where one can get a good view of the sign. Since we go to the area to see movies at the Chinese Theater, its easy to walk over to the center and get a good view of the sign as well.In terms of history, the sign has evolved over time. However the first time the sign became part of the magic of Hollywood was in 1923 and it has continued to be a sign people seek to get a look at when they are in the area. Its still a fun sign for me to see although I have seen it now many many times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini

40,A must!,"You can't go to Hollywood without taking a photo of this! You can see it just about anywhere but a good place to take photos is from the Griffith observatory .

30,Let down,Hard to get to the Hollywood sign without guidance. We had a local drive us around. Didn't go up all the way to the sign. No designated spot to park and take pictures. Had to stop in a busy street and stop the traffic so we can get a pic of us with sign in background. Drivers were nice enough to allow this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SpokieTexas
50,Bucket List,"We researched online how to get close to the sign. Once we started winding up the narrow neighborhood streets of the Hollywood Hills, I knew we were going in the right direction because the two cars in front of us had out of state license plates. We all parked in the same place and made the short yet steep walk to a great vantage point on a ridge under the sign with a fantastic view of the entire LA basin. Awesome experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILMCY1

30,My daughter's bucket list,"My daughter and I spent a week in LA in July 2014. One of items on her bucket list was to hike up to the Hollywood Sign. I spent some time researching online how to get there and reviewed the different trail options. We started by going to Griffith Park and were turned away by a very young guard(high school student?). When asked how to get to the sign, he didn't have an answer. We stopped and parked and took a chance at a trail head and started up the trail. We asked a couple of people picnicking in the park who said we were in the wrong place. They very helpfully guided us to the top of Canyon Lake Road. There is a very small parking lot there - 8 spots. We had researched this option so parked and started out. As we were walking we came upon a local who was very helpful in pointing out a few trail branches that we had to look out for. We only took one wrong turn and ended up at a dead end by a small water tank, but it turned out to be an awesome photo op just below the sign. The sign looms large and is fully visible without any obstructions. we asked some workmen about the correct trail and they also didn't know how to get to the sign. We back tracked to the last trail branch and took the other option that led us ultimately up to the sign. The view was worth it and with other people up there, we were able to get a shot with the two of us together with the sign and the LA city spread out behind us.The trip took 2 hours total to get up and about 45 minutes to get down. We are both fairly fit so the hike was not strenuous, just long and very hot. The trail is basically a road, mostly gravel and partly paved. In fact when we were up there, a police car came out of the cell tower compound, so the road is in decent shape. The frustrating part of the hike was the utter lack of signage and ignorance/refusal of the locals to help. This was reinforced by the workmen we met at the water tower who didn't know how to get there but showed up at the sign while we were taking pictures! The impression I get is that the locals really don't want you in the park and climbing up to the sign. Even at the Canyon Lake Trail head there is a sign saying no Hollywood sign access. The parking is very limited and the neighbourhood roads are skinny with no parking. Even still Griffith Park is a regional/state park and there should be signs and maps all over the place. I live in the Vancouver/Whistler area and all the parks and trails are well marked. Even within the parks there are little mini maps with a ""you are here"" dot.I give hike five stars for the view but only one star to Griffith park for the very poor access, no signage and no restroom facilities in the park. Come on people, how hard can it be to put a porta-potti at the top. We are all told to bring lots of water and stay hydrated, but nowhere to relieve ourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651stanh

50,A Must Do for Every LA Native,"If you live and are from the Los Angeles area, you have to do the hike to the Hollywood sign. How could anyone live here and miss out on visiting this icon? Parking is free and can be difficult to get. Last time I went, my friend and I just finished the hike and were having a snack in the parking lot when two dudes started yelling at each other over a parking space. I thought they were going to duke it out but they didn't. So be warned, the parking situation can get fierce. The hike is beautiful but strenuous. Takes lots of water and take breaks if you need to. Watch out for horse pooh and rattle snakes. Also, this is a great hike to take your doggie. My dog loved it and he was worn out by the end. Once you get to the sign, you get to see the back side and all of the LA Basin. It is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASega2011
40,The symbol of dreams come true,"It's well worth the hike to see this enduring symbol of Hollywood and dreams.No one complained about the heat when we made the hike, but of course do take water and a hat. The hike isn't that strenuous.Be careful where and how you park your car.The sign is the symbol of Hollywood and pretty much the first thing people will ask if you saw. Don't disappoint them or yourself....it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dim-sum-mum
40,Nice Scenery,"We enjoyed the scenery driving to the Hollywood sign. We used the 3204 Canyon Lake address. Instead of turning around to leave the area we continued the drive up the mountain, on Canyon Lake Drive. The Hollywood sign is grand and so are the homes. Reality is that you can't touch the Hollywood sign and you can't get as close to it as it looks on TV. However, just to see it and take lots of pictures makes you feel on top of the world. I thought the dog park was a nice. If I lived in LA I would take my dog there to play.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WGwiz

50,Quite a challenge.,"The climb up seems longer than coming back down. I have been wanting to hike and get my wife into it also. Since my cousin and his wife were in town and agreed to hike one morning, it was decided to head to the Hollywood sign. I've lived here in Anaheim for 9 years and my wife since she was a kid. Never before have we seen the Hollywood sign and were up for the challenge.We started from a park not far from a ranch nearby (which was closed) and the parking wasn't bad at all for 9am.Bring lots of water. The climb up was tough but the company really helped redirect the challenge to make it more fun. We found spots of shade under trees along most of the first half, but less once you hit the slight incline and plateau. But once you reach the top and see the sign right there...it gave us all that sense of accomplishment and worthiness.After it all...though the bodies sore and aching...it was a great hike and worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E_moRtal_1
40,It's a landmark. You have to go.,"The only thing special about seeing the sign, is the fact that you are seeing the sign. It is well worth it, and lets face it, if you have been to LA, everyone will ask if you saw the Hollywood sign. It's a cool thing to do, so just do it and enjoy yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstyKelly
30,Good Photos That's It,The trail to the sign was closed due to danger on the trail so you could only get far away shots or take the tour from the observatory which cost money. Honestly it's just a sign but a cool one. See it and take a photo and move one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmonstrola

50,Hike to the World Famous Hollywood Sign,"The Hollywood Sign is the most iconic symbols of Southern California; this trek has been on my bucket list for many years, and in June of 2014, we achieved this adventure.The Hollywood Sign is accessible and it can and should be a go to destination at least once during your time in California. The hike is easy enough that any member of the family can trek it. The sign can be accessed from multiple trailhead locations from hike level 1 to hike level 5 - Moderate Uphill with some Rolling Hills. I began my hike from the Hollywood land park trailhead and be advised that from this trailhead this hike is no joke. (Level 3.5) The first 1.2miles is all uphill and there is minimal shade with one awesome shade tree. After your first 1.2 mile you will find a small sign that says ‚ÄúYou Made It‚Äù From this point the remainder mile and a half to the sign is smooth sailing. When you arrive at the Hollywood Sign you will see a unique view of LA that is unlike most other views as you see the Hollywood Sign with LA behind it. Don‚Äôt forget to bring your camera because you will see many picturesque views during your hike. The return trip is awesome because it‚Äôs all downhill. ‚ÄúYEA‚Äù!MY RECOMMENDATIONS: Start your hike early morning because there are minimal shade trees along the hike and it can get hot. Bring 2 to 3 Liters of water, sunscreen, have a light breakfast bite prior to hike. PARKING: There is no charge for parking. FOOD: Small Snack to eat when you get to the Hollywood Sign (You‚Äôll want a snack!). RESTROOMS: There are restrooms at the Trail head.., Use the restroom prior to the hike as there are none along the way.SUGGESTION: After you concur the Hollywood Sign visit the freaks and geeks in downtown Hollywood and get your GRUBB ON. Check Out our home video ‚ÄúSail‚Äù of the hike on You Tube at CoCoMoe Adventure‚ÄúGet Up Get Out and Get Adventuring‚Äù CoCoMoe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoCoMoesAdventure
50,From the Griffith Observatory,We searched for a vista point to get good photos of the Hollywood sign on our GAS and it took us to the Griffith Park. The clich√©d photography session was done there. But the place does have an aura of awe in it. Felt great to be able to see this landmark in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jyothinj
40,"There's a ""Secret"" Route to a Photo Op","If you want to drive up to see the Hollywood sign, there is a way to get there. My iPhone Maps App led me there, but here it is anyway: Get off the 101 Fwy at Barham Blvd. Go east and turn right on Lake Hollywood Dr. There's a sign that says, ""NO HOLLYWOOD SIGN ACCESS"" but there's access to a great photo opportunity. Follow the road and turn left onto Primera Ave and right on La Suvida Dr. Make a slight right onto Lake Hollywood Dr. (again) and go about 1.5 miles. It will look like a dead end before but then you'll go through more neighborhood area. You'll come to a park on your left, but continue up the hill and there's a flat spot that overlooks Hollywood and the Lake as well as looks up to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofamily
20,Nothing special,"It could have been great attraction, only if you can get closer to it. Apparently the best you can do is to hike for an hour from Griffith observatory only for slighly better view while sign itself is still too far away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rvs-ru
20,Cross it off the bucket list,"Just one of those things you have to say that you've seen when you visit LA/Hollywood...really nothing special. We drove through the narrow, windy back roads of the developments in the area to get a good vantage point to see the sign and take a picture. (The city prohibits you from getting too close so you can only see it in the distance and their are no ""official"" viewing areas.) Stayed just long enough to capture the image on film...anti-climatic, really!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899donnas
50,Your trip to LA is incomplete without visiting this!,"We had been seeing it from everywhere we went but we just had TO get up there and see it up close and personal. We took the drive up and made it there just by asking people we saw on the way - ""Where's the Hollywood sign?"" We knew we had found the perfect picture spot when we saw plethora of tour buses and cars parked this steep hill and everyone was just taking pictures left and right. We went around sunset and it was gorgeous - got some great photos - maybe marveled at the view or about another 10-15 minutes and we were on our way! This is a must - you can't just go to LA and NOT go as close as possible to the Hollywood sign :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nidah2013
50,"Lived on the street, most amazing views","I lived on Deronda drive while studying acting in LA. this is without a doubt the closest and best place to view the sign. Go right to the top and it's very clear. On weekends the roads are closed and only residents are allowed, so give them a break on those days please! There are 5 fabulous other days you can view it! There is also great views of the city and a great wee restaurant on Beachwood that has amazing food and service :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annabelrd
30,Just a couple of letters...,"Just a couple of famous letters on the hill. ""Must see""... - I don't know... You can make some shots from Griffith Observatory - but the view is just average/poor - nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbQ5308QB
50,great to see this landmark,Nothing seems to be special until you go to the hill to personally feel the landmark in front of you. It is not the same on photos or tv.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SekBoy
20,Walked to Behind Sign,"Don't do it. I was planning to do the Hollyridge trail but it was closed and had to start from Camp Hollywoodland. It was in the sun and took forever both up and down. I'm a pretty decent hiker, my younger teenage brother who's pretty fit was hating it too. When we finally got to the top the view wasn't really worth the trip - I would suggest getting pictures from the front at the bottom. Free parking before the trail. It's all up hill, serious steady incline. The trails aren't marked so be careful b/c you could accidentally go the wrong way at certain pts - When you hit the stone pavement go right on the road it will take you behind the sign. 3hrs RT I think. I love to hike and even I wouldn't suggest it, but if it's on your bucket list than do it (that's why we did), it won't kill you but bring LOTS of water and food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLona1

20,Hollywood Sign Headaches,"We tried to to get up to the old parking area but it is closed now. After spending 20 minutes stuck trying to get higher up the canyon behind too many cars and police giving a ticket, we gave up. The next day we took a shuttle from the Greek Theatre that only cost $7 but got us into the park easily for a good photo. http://www.laparks.org/shuttle/shuttle.htm. Definitely saved us a lot of time and hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidrI9162PU

50,My Son's One Goal for Vacation...,"...was to see the Hollywood Sign. I have a friend in the area who knows the way to get to Mulholland Dam, so we saw the sign from there. My son (who is autistic) was utterly gleeful to see this thing, he has wanted to see it for years. It didn't matter to me but I'm sure he would give it 5 stars. It was a nice area...the Dam and then the reservoir were as interesting to me as the sign was to him.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dee29290
30,Far Away,"I thought the sign was closer than it actually was, I guess it has always looked as if you can walk right up too it. We were a little ways away from the sign, however, I have a great zoom lens and was able to get a close picture. I was just giddy to be near it. Something I have always wanted to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrose72

40,Iconic,How can you travel to L.A. without getting as close as possible to the famous Hollywood Sign?? Great viewing from Griffith Observatory. Bring your camera and enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCavall
40,Of course you want to see it --- you're in Hollywood!,"There is plenty of hype of how best to see it; the city makes a lot of its money on that sign in the hills! Starline tours of Hollywood of course makes it a part of the tour; they stop briefly to allow pictures but traffic is heavy and wants to go, so you won't get yourself in the pictures with it this way).I think an amazing vantage point is up Runyon Canyon dog park off of Franklin, on the first peak or ledge (no need to go higher as its almost on level viewing). You get an amazing view of the city stretched out before you from 3 sides; an unobstructed view of the Hollywood sign with many perspectives for your great photo shots with you in the foreground and about an hour of exercise! Where comfortable shores for heavy walking and I would suggest an early morning hike no later than 9 am to avoid smog blocking the panoramic view (to the ocean edge on a clear day) and heat! Don't forget to bring water, though just at the Franklin gate entrance some resident is selling water and snacks/fruit. Not recommended for those with heart or leg disability or those who are afraid of dogs as after all it is a dog park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72lauraleem
40,Exceptional view,I got the info how to get to a parking lot from where to view the sign from our local AA. But I suppose any hotel-clerk can give you this information. If you have a car it will be worth this effort.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wiesi
50,The Hollywood sign is a must see!,"It's hard to explain what makes seeing the Hollywood sign so great. Maybe it's because most of us grew up seeing it in various movies and TV shows, giving it ""iconic status"", that makes it exciting to see in person... for me, at least! I highly recommend driving up to Griffith Observatory for the most amazing view of it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/209randie
40,"If you're in LA, seeing the sign is a must see","My husband and I have been here before, but this time we brought my son and daughter in law.

40,Hard to see....,Hard to see from our Runyon hike but still pretty neat. I took a few pics but it was hard to see due to distance and smog. Definitely go during the day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simpsonatc22
50,Took our own tour,"Hollywood sign is a must see whilst in LA, you can obviously see it from down and around LA. However as we hired a car we decided to take our own trip/tour to see it for ourselves.We basically typed in Hollywood sign on the satnav, and drove up these winding roads around Hollywood hills. It was such an experience!! When we reached the sign, probably the closest we could get it was totally worth it! Great views at the top across LA, so my advice is save some money and don't take the tour, Do it yourself, we got really close to the sign with in the allocated premises may I add! But it wasn't jam packed with tourists like us, which was a bonus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steven7W
50,Hollywood definite,"The whole hollywood sign is probably the biggest attraction, seen in many movies it was definitely on my bucket list!

50,Best seen up close,"Had the privilege to get to drive up to the park, which is right up in from of the sign. Able to get great up close pictures and also a dog park if you have a pet. Canyon Lake Road is the street you need to find to get there, as you will wind through a neighborhood to get to the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshW937
30,"Nice to see during the day, but not at night","My daughters really wanted to see the Hollywood sign, but a lot of reviews said in order to get a close of view, a hike would be involved. I opted to follow the reviews that said to drive through residential neighborhoods to get close to it. We were there about 10 minutes to take pictures. The girls asked if we could go back later on that night, but little did we know that they do not light up the sign at night. It took less than 10 minutes to get there from 101 so it wasn't that much time wasted. There is also a vista point on Mullholland Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/994jenr
50,Bragging rights for son,"My family took a morning visit to the Hollywood sign for some photo opportunities. Our oldest son thought it would be cool to get proof of his Hollywood visit for friends and family. We traveled through the Hollywood Hills area, which was very beautiful just a bit dangerous due to the slim road allowing only one car to drive through w steep hills and sharp curves. The locals drive a lil reckless so be careful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/liveinthemomentnow
30,Can't get close to it,"We hiked to the sign from Griffith Observatory, pretty long and very warm hike. Not super difficult terrain just long and and very hot. The shortest route/trail was closed. So once you finally get all the way up, behind and above the sign you can see most of it backwards through a fence. Very anti-climatic. Just take pictures from the bottom of the hill. If you attempt to climb the fence and get down near the letters you can be arrested and get a $103 fine. They have cameras mounted on poles near the fence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimmyJackk
40,This view defines Hollywood,"Yes, you have to go here and get those perfect pictures. This is a dream come through for sure as Hollywood means so much to all of us. We also saw some coyotes very near were we took the pictures and I joked with my wife and said that Coyotes were coming after us and she started running like Forrest Gump....help!! (that was funny)You will get the best pictures if you go to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood. It takes 10 minutes to walk from the parking to the perfect spot.",
50,Photo stop,"You must put this on he list off things to do, great photo stop...you will be best going on a tour that takes you up to the lookout as it is behind you. You cannot go all the way up to the top but great spot at the look out",
50,Awesome!,"It is notable for its place as the home of the entertainment industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come to represent the motion picture industry of the United States. Hollywood is also a highly ethnically diverse, densely populated, economically diverse neighborhood and retail business district.",
50,"We chased it, found best view",Best view was from Griffin Observatory at sunset. It was beautiful. Also found a view off of Mulholland Drive. This is where the tour buses were taking groups for a picture. We did it for free.,
30,Travel at your own risk...,"You will have a heck of a time trying to get close to the sign. The main road is closed, so you have to wind your way through neighborhoods in the hills on those tight, windy roads. When you finally get to the photo op spot, it is crowded and near impossible to park and get out. That said, I like the picture and I'm glad we have it.",
50,How to get close to the Hollywood Sign.,This symbol of Tinseltown keeps popping into your vision from lots of points. You can see it from the cross bridge a the Hollywood and Highlands Centre and with a good camera you can get a nice photo...but if you want a close up then put 3360 Deronda Drive in your GPS / Sat Nav. This will take you through Beverly Hills up through narrow streets to the dead end road where you can get great views and close up photos (put it in Google street view and see what I mean). Then walk through the arched gateway into the park and up the bank to a large flat area and you will get the best views and photos of the sign possible. A great opportunity to see the world famous sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterandLesley2013

40,Iconic History,Everyone knows the sign so you must see it when in LA. Lucky for you it is visible almost anywhere north of downtown. There are some really good spots that have been set up to get great pictures of the sign and you with the sign. So swing by and see what everyone knows live and in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrentJ293
30,One for the bucket list,Its just one of those things you have to do when in LA i guess. The roads leading up to one of the best views of it are quite twisty and steep. If you turn round the view is actually pretty good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/907markw
50,You have to see it in person... everyone will ask if you did when you get home!,"Lots of places to see it.A good place to see it is at the mall at Hollywood & Highland. They even have telescopes to view it. But it is too far away for a really good photo unless you have an expensive camera.We took the photos from Griffith Park. You can walk up a small hill... past the ""Batman TV Show Batcave Tunnel""... and can see the sign. It is FABULOUS there for a picture. It looks like an easy hike up... but it is NOT. The photo is deceptive!!!To get up really close you will NOT be able to photograph it. The letters are about 4 stories high! But if you are adventurous, it is the ultimate climb in LA. Some people we talked to tried, but said it was too much for them & was a little dangerous. But they were glad they tried. They also tried to hike / climb from Griffith Park.NO BATHROOMS",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kowalisyn
40,How to go Closer to the Hollywood Sign.,The Hollywood Sign its a marquee of Hollywood and LA but its usually seen from either the Griffiths Observatory or the Highlands Mall. The truth is you cannot touch the sign or even get 100 ft closer but there is a couple of places where you can have a great shot for photo memories.The best place is around Lake Hollywood Park in the Upper Hollywood Reservoir. To get there you can try to enter just before the freeway entrance of Highland Avenue but the best place to go there is to take this route:-On the 101 freeway take the 11b exit to Barham Boulevard. The second street is Lake Hollywood Drive. You have to follow that street all around the hill and follow the sign up to the lake reservoir. You have to follow the water all around the road up to the end when this street becomes Tahoe Drive. At the end of Tahoe Drive you have to turn right and at the end of the hill you would be in the middle of Lake Hollywood Park.Take the photo and enjoy the place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMartinSDXB
30,A sign on the hill,"Its high. Its not accessible. The movies have led us all astray. You can not climb, see or touch the sign.All you do is watch it from some distance and take your photo.Check.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/einaravh
40,Must See on LA Visit,This is another must see attraction when visiting Los Angeles. One of the best views is from the observatory from the parking lot. We did get a great view from the shopping mall (Hollywood and Highland) from the fourth level on an observation view point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670PaulL
50,Joy ride in the Hollywood Hillts,"We drove up to see the sign and the wife wanted me to keep getting closer. We did get very close to take some pictures but could not go any further (the road was blocked off). We took a right turn and WOW! We ended up on a very tight, winding road. Thank God there wasn't any traffic coming the other way. I don't see how these folks do it. There were cars parked on the road that could not have been wider than 15 feet. We finally made it out. Driving through there with OHIO plates probably looked very odd, but I'm sure we weren't the first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameshJ4651IR
50,It just has to be done,"There is no way you can travel from the UK to Hollywood and not go and see the sign, that would be just criminal. We had our own car and it was a nice drive up there. We took lots of pictures , walked around a bit and took in the views. You don't need very long up there and it isn't far from the centre of town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeylaGR

50,Icon Sign of Hollywood,"There are a few cool vantage points to see the sign, one is from Hollywood and Highland between the two large Elephants there is a cat walk on the second floor. There is a viewer there too. Another spot is the top floor of the Home Depot parking lot on Sunset Blvd. You can hike up to the sign sometimes. Currently the trail is closed. Always check before you go. You can drive up into Hollywoodland which is what the sign was installed many years ago to mark the area. It used to say Hollywoodland but the ""land"" part is long gone and all that remains is Hollywood. It got a face life a few years ago, so it is in great shape.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PineappleShagette
40,A must see,Locals and tourists alike enjoy the views. You can see the Hollywood sign from all over LA on a clear day. The hike up is amazing as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesVincentV19
50,Classic Los Angeles Photo Op,"TravelinAlan lives in Los Angeles, where it took over 60 years to get the attached photo. The sign is visable from many places. However, it will require a bit of effort to get to a place where you can be in the picture with the sign. You will have to find a place to park, then take a short walk where you can find a place to put you and the sign in a photo. It's not difficult and worth the effort.You and the sign will make it all worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinAlan
50,"Scenic, Fun and a Healthy Adventure for all","We hiked a couple of times from the Griffith Park Observatory to the top of the mountain facing the Hollywood Sign. The hike can be done with basic tennis or walking shoes. It is not too steep. My son started doing the hike at the age of 6. He loves the achievement of reaching to top, seeing the famous sign and the breathtaking views. It was very panoramic once you hit the top. You can see Monterey Park, Pasadena, Glendale all the way around to the San Fernando Valley. You can also see downtown and the west side. It is seriously gorgeous! Take some simple snacks and water with you on a warm day. Towards the top there are a few benches in a pretty terraced garden for a break. Horses also travel up a trail from the back end. It is an amazing spot at the top for photography. It is for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee802692
10,Kidnapped on different tour by HOLLYWOODLAND TOURS,"Bought a voucher from Amazon Local on Feb. 9, 2014. When in L.A. called the company, in order to reserve the Hollywood Sign Tour for two people. From the beginning the guy on the other end tried me to go for the ""Celebrity Mansions Tour"" instead. Politely responded I was not interested. When we got into the van, once again the driver tried to take us on the ""Celebrity Mansions Tour"" and, when I responded we were interested into the Hollywood sign he answered he was going to give us both tours. After quite a terrible ""up and down among Celebs villas tour"", and feeling ashame for disturbing the privacy of the communities of Beverly Hills, Bel Air, etc. due to the loud comments of the driver on the vehicle's P/A system, we were dropped back at the starting point without even having seen the Hollywood sign from less than 3 miles in the distance. When we complained the driver told us that ""the Sign was now closed to tourists"". I had taken my information and the famous Landmark was actually going to be temporarily closed two days after my intended tour. Terrible experience indeed. It's unbelievable people like these are left running a business in such a manner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ricky_the_Gypsy

40,"Such a Hollywood icon, you must have a look.","I'm happy to say that the sign is in good repair and obviously being looked after. As we wound our way up the hills to get the best view, we had a great look at residential Hollywood. The streets twisted and turned and with our ""Stars Homes"" map in hand, it was fun to see how the other half lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanYHZ

50,Incredible journey up to the sign,"A must see journey while in LA. I was quite excited to see the sign, and while you don't get incredibly close to the sign itself, the drive alone made the trip worth it. You wind up thru the beautiful Hollywood Hills (luckily I had a compact car, otherwise the journey could have been a touch more scary.) 45 degree blind turns as you hug the cliff...it was breathtaking. There were not many people at the top once I arrived, the trail obviously slowing down some tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelsea-ann
40,A must see,Unfortunately was not able to get up close as we were on a city tour. I was able to get a picture with the sign in the background worth seeing this icon,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannia2014

40,A icon to visit.,"This was the first thing we visited in LA. It's very typical tourist, but hey, it's too iconic not to have a picture with it.It looks like there are a few places to see it. If you're in the Hollywood walk of Fame area, you can simply see it from the Hollywood and highland shopping center.We went to the Griffith Observatory, which was more than satisfying.note: GPS tells us to go into small residential streets, but there are tons of signs saying ""Dead end - No access to Observatory"". We didn't bother trying.Instead, we took N Vermont rd, which eventually becomes N Vermont Canyon rd, directly to the observatory. Parking is very limited at the top, so people park along the side of the road. I think you spend more time looking for parking than visiting the area.For pictures, there is a nice trail (minimal elevation) that allows you to get closer for a better picture. Takes maybe 15 min at a reasonable pace. It's worth it. That's where we got our best picture.other note: If you go on a sunny day, it gets really hot up there, despite a light breeze .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happy_stomach
40,Nice Hike,I could see the sign from afar! My friend and I hiked up towards the sign. The hike itself was long but very beautiful. There were a lot of kids there from what looked like a field trip. But we stuck to ourselves and had fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laura_altamirano86
40,Hollywood Sign,Of course you have to get a picture in front of the Hollywood Sign when you go to Los Angeles!! We just typed in Hollywood sign in the google map app on my phone and it took us all the way up a winding narrow steep hill (residential area) until we couldn't go any farther. We were driving a big f250 and it was nerve wrecking for me but fun for my hubby! There was a security guy that was stopping vehicles from going any further and showing us where to park along the street and then we walked up the hill just a little bit and their was a great viewing point then! Got lots of fun pictures. I know you can hike up to it too but that puts you up behind the sign not to mention the long hike! We were very happy with how close we got on this hill!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sethw118
50,Iconic Must-See / Must Photograph!!,"Best viewed from the Hollywood & Highland Complex (where the Dolby Theatre and world-famous Chinese Theatre are). Best view is in any of the balconies inside the huge ""Arc de Triomphe""-like structure near the dancing fountains -- you can't miss finding the gigantic arch, it's about 10 stories tall -- anyway, it was built for providing excellent views of the Hollywood Sign. Look the other way (behind you) for a great view of the El Capitan Theatre's gorgeous neon marquee, and see a movie there, it's freakin' incredible showmanship in a real movie palace (you can even sit in the upper balconies in the El Capitan and they show the biggest new movies).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyc302
30,"It is not a simple sign, it is the Hollywood Sign!","It is one of the most recognizable sign in the world.It is reachable only by car and you cannot get much close to the sign, which can be looked at by the road below that. You have to park along the road if you want to take some pictures, but there is a wide open space to walk.Very nice the road through the hills to get there, full of villas.You also can get a pretty sight of the city by there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AEmiliano
50,Can't Miss Spot!,"If you are visiting Los Angeles for the 1st time, this is the 1st thing I believe you always wanted to see. Yes, go ahead and check it. Its worth a visit. You can't miss historic Hollywood sign which also a symbol of the Los Angeles and Hollywood. There are several spots you can go and see the sign closely. One of the most easiest spot is Lake Hollywood Park. You can continue drive on Mulholland Hwy (its not dead end) or you can park nearby and walk on that road. You will get some very nice and close spots to see Hollywood Sign. Parking is free by the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanzir26
30,Just a sign,"Really not much to see, but a old sign. Took a tour up to see the Hollywood sign, a waste of time. The view was Ok, face it LA does not have the best Skyline. The rest of the tour was good, but the Hollywood Sign, Skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylanz2014
50,worth visit,"it's worth to visit. You can't drive all the way to the sign now, but just follow the road sign, and get as close as possible",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PengP43
40,Must do in LA,"I have fond memories of this place as this is where my hubby proposed to me...We went to the front of the sign, where the trail can be a bit scary, you may need to use your hands and you'll see many signs that say ""Do not hike to the Hollywood sign"", but it's got great views and great place to take pics so do it!I have yet to try the hiking trail from behind the sign but I heard it's fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelosivi
40,Decent Hike,"Made great pictures, and a decent walk/hike up the hill for a good view. A definite Los Angeles visit, its not complete without a picture of you with the Hollywood Sign in the back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haroldl475
50,A must see!,"Just seeing this sign in pictures does it no Justice! The first time seeing the sign in person was quite the experience. Then, we took a long hike through Griffith Park to get a close up view. It was a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crlillian
40,A must on your trip to LA,It is visible from different areas but the best is to view it from the hill. It is definitely a must on your trip to LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akankshay
40,Do a Tour,"Ok, so the Hollywood sign was on my ""Must Do"" list, but I wrongly thought that I could see it from Hollywood Blvd. Seriously, people, don't be me... take a tour or something. Hike up there. Just get closer. I was way too far away to even matter, let alone get a pic with me under it. Next time I go to LA, I will make sure to get a cheap tour that will take me up closer. That will be all I do in Hollywood, since that place is atrocious, but I really do want to get closer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArtfulExistence
40,Hilltop,The first time I was in LA my hotel balcony faced the hills and there was the Hollywood sign. Now it is something whose presence I feel. You can hike up and get a close look. Any excuse for an outdoors excursion is a good one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
50,Cool to See!,"It's cool to see in person but at the end of the day it's just letters. What I enjoyed most was the drive up the mountains and its surrounding scenery. Once your up to the top you will find beautiful hills, la skyline, and the Hollywood lakes. All in all its worth it at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seetheworldb4ureyes
30,The Iconic Sign,"We went to the Griffith Park for photos of the Hollywood sign with LA tours, we were able to see the Hollywood sign a few times while driving around LA but Bret our tour guide told us to take our Hollywood sign pictures from the Griffith Park. I had to queue to take the picture from the corner as from other places I was getting the sign as Hollywooo !! Well it is only a sign and I have seen it many times in pictures but when you are in LA then it is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smeetsp
50,Great Photo Opportunity,"we took the tour bus from Hollywood Blvd and went to the top to see the Hollywood sign - what a great experience! Have your picture taken appearing to hold the Hollywood sign. The views from the top are spectacular, a must see when in the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Native2tx
30,Quirky landmark,"We traversed the winding narrow streets of LA to get to the sign, although you can see it from locations in Hollywood such as Griffith Observatory, Hollywood and Highland St., Mulholland Drive and the Canyon Lake Viewpoint. It is just the thing to do when visiting. You have to decide if it is worth it. We found a spot to park and there is a little walk up. I don't recommend it for those in wheelchairs except to go to the Observatory. There are hiking trails etc. Check about it at the website and do web searches if you want to plan well.Website for info: http://www.hollywoodsign.org/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinjebar
50,A Must Do Hike for LA,"If you're in LA, you can't afford to miss the iconic yet easy Hollywood sign hike with great views of Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles and more.Check out the full step-by-step directions and download a map on my website (theoutsidelife.com).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HikingGuyCom
40,you have to go!!,You can't go to LA without having your photo took infront of this sign!! Apart from that there is a brilliant view over all of LA so that is well worth the drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeJ437
30,Iconic Sign,"Outside of that and having seen it in almost anything involving Hollywood, that is all it is. If you really must go up or around it, it is amazing how large it really is. I agree with the others and suggest getting a good photo op from the shopping center on the walk of fame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch
40,Must picture!,"As people say, they are just letters. However, taking a picture is a must. I took a few from the santa monica hills. Driving up to the sign itself is not worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OP_Family
40,Just a fun time,took public transportation and walked. Yes we are crazy but it was really a fun time. Did the clich√© pictures pretending to hold the sign up and having it look like the words were coming out of our mouths. Found out that some public transportation is cheep in LA. Created a great memory with my son. Finally something touristy but not touisty,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesetteh
40,Must see but don't get too excited!,We only had a short stop in LA so didn't have time to take the drive out to see the sign close up. Instead using a recommendation from TA we went to the shopping centre behind Graumans Chinese Theatre. Access is currently blocked to the top floor but if you go to the back of the shopping area and take the steps as high as you can go you can still get a good view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParqueTropical
50,A perfect end to our stay in LA,"From memory I think we walked the Brush Canyon Trail, literally a dirt path that appears at the end of a street lined with houses. All I know is, we walked forever but the view was worth it. We were more side on to the sign rather than directly in front of it but just the fact we were close to it was enough! Wherever we were standing had amazing views of LA and despite the unusual angle, it was a fab spot to watch the sun disappear behind the sign.Whatever trail you decide to take, or whatever angle you are on, definitely try and get up close, it will make your day :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshH1611
50,A sign of the times,This sign is great to see as it is so famous and you just have to see it to say you have. Take some photo's to prove it but nothing much else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelindaB999
40,A must stop,"Well what is it to say, this is a must stop the first time you are in LA. A bit hard to find the spot, but if you do some point map driving and not just drive of the GPS you will find it easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vekselstrom
40,The park,Don't forget to go to the park below. It is really nice there in the quiet morning. There is good view on the sign too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelab797

50,Beautiful,Nice view and unforgettable experience to see one of the world landmark. It's been our second trip to Ollywood and Imwill never sick and tired to come in this place in the future. I really do recommend to everyone who are fun of travelling to consider this place to their itenirary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beauty1583
40,Best view of Hollywood sign,"My mission for my 1st LA visit was to go to the Hollywood sign...mission accomplished, I went, I saw, I conquered the hike up to the Hollywood sign!Prior to my visit, I read numerous reviews for the best views & directions to the sign, I found the BEST location to view & hike to the front of the sign is 3350 Deronda Drive. On your GPS app (I used Waze app), try to avoid the freeway because there is always an accident or heavy traffic. it is better to take the street route. While on Beachwood Dr. you will see the Hollywood sign ahead while driving, ignore any signs you see that read, No Access. Make sure to follow the driving directions, if you miss a turn (like I did) while up in the hills, there is no way to turn around in the tight narrow residential areas you will have to take a drive back to one of the original points on the route. Be advised, there is a very sharp right U-turn at Ledgewood Dr & Rockcliff Dr., be careful of cars coming down, the drive up the hill is high, tight & narrow. Once you get to the dead end of Deronda Drive (cul de sac), you'll see the green gate & white wall with arched walkway. Park on the curb, parking is VERY limited so get there early (preferably before 11am). Once out of the car, walk through arched walkway...if you go to the right, up the stairs will lead you to a wonderful valley view or walk pass the chain will lead you to a good photo shoot of the sign. If you want a better photo shoot of the sign walk to the left from the arched walkway, the dirt trail will lead you to a better view of the sign (there is no horse poop on this trail). If you're feeling adventurous, cross the chains down the ramp, start hiking/climbing up to the front of the sign & great photo shots of the breath taking view of LA.Warning: Make sure you bring water/Gatorade & If you are afraid of heights PLEASE do not go up to the sign, coming down is a very uncomfortable feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cassm73
50,Beachwood Drive / Hollyridge Trail to the top of Mount Lee/back of sign,"The coolest thing we did on our trip! Our first trip to LA, and the one major to-do was to walk up as close as possible to the Hollywood Sign ... a number of websites pointed to the Beachwood/Hollyridge Trail ... and so, off we went in the late Sunday afternoon in March. Perfectly ideal weather though like an idiot, I didn't bring water with me (despite everyone who said to do so), wish I had. Took Beachwood all the way to the end ... or tried to. Once we got to the end - the end is very obvious, by the way - the road just STOPS - there was no parking on either side of the road. So we turned back 'round and found the closest parking on Beachwood that we could ... which wasn't very close. Being late afternoon on a Sunday on a beautiful March day, I suppose we weren't the only ones with hiking the Hollyridge Trail in mind! The hike was no problem for 3 of the 4 of us .. the 4th (out of shape me) came up huffin' and puffin' and trailing behind ... but I did make it. Walking shoes and a positive attitude towards hilly walking are pretty critical. Views and photo opps are amazing. It is fairly straightforward BUT there is one section where you can either go right (don't) or take a sharp left. Take the left. Despite having read about this, and mapped it out in my head, and trying to read it on my phone while huffin' and puffin' walking, we missed the sharp left until some other hiker pointed it out to us. I spent some time doing some internet research to figure out the best way to approach the trail, but it was research that was fairly easily done. Took us almost an hour to walk up to the back of the sign, though keep in mind we were stopping fairly constantly to take zillions of photos. And then we stayed up there for quite a while to take a million more. Coming down was much quicker, though we were just (what good planning!) hitting the sunset by then, so of course, had to get tons more shots. I figure we were there - from the time we parked our car on Beachwood to the time we got back to our car - for at least 2.5 hours, maybe more. Would totally do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamc40
40,A tourist spot that's a must stop,"I mean who doesn't go to LA and try to get some sort of picture of the Hollywood sign? Or make sure you take a road that will let you catch a glimpse of it.Sure you can't get really close to it, and that's a bummer, but I understand that they're trying to upkeep it and keep the integrity of it, so be it. There are tons if locations to see this sign, but the best one is the unmarked one. It's up Canyon through the neighborhood and right above the reservoir. There's a park there on both sides of the road and the road widens from the twisty narrow neighborhood roads, to one wide enough to park on both sides. This is pretty much the closest you can to it by car and be able to get out and snap a photo. I highly suggest checking this rout out. There will be no signs though, as its kind of a ""locals only"" type of deal.Nothing fancy, it's actually a lot smaller, and kinda hard to see from most places, but still worth a quick drive to snap a photo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iagomega
50,(: HollyWood :),This was exciting to see for us. Would have loved to gotten closer but time was not our side for the trip. We did get great pictures from a mall type area in Hollywood. The higher the floor you get on the better the view. I'm sure there are better areas but this was exciting enough for us with the time we had.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judy177
40,Worth a look,"We got our taxi driver to take us for a drive after a tour at nearby Warner Bros studios. He found as a couple of great viewing spots to get a good photo and it was great to see it in real life.We didn't have a lot of time in LA, if you're there longer perhaps a hike up the hill would be fun, but I suspect you can get almost as close with a good cabbie or perhaps a tour group.Plus you will get good glimpses of the sign from many spots in LA so only make the trek if you're really keen to get close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Esme99
30,Hollywood sign,"When you drive to the sign, i presume you can get very close, but the drive is through residential area and you feel as if you are lost even though you are following the satnav. When you exit the residential area you come across a park and you feel have reached your destination as the satnav states (depening on your satnav) that you have reached the destination.However, if you keep on driving up the drive till you reach the end of the paved road, you get much closer and get better a view of both the sign and L.A. There is a dirt track which you could take if it is not a private road, which probably takes you closer but we didn't check it out.From Echo Park, where we stayed the drive was about 30 minutes but i suppose that depends where you are staying in L.A",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Abdul7829

50,Amazing hike,This hike took 2 hours ish which i doubted at first but it was real but soo worth it! you can take the sort cuts to the top to be quick. we took the first short cut up and took the second one coming down. the second one coming down was quite difficult but the views kind of made it worth it haha going up rather than down the second short cut would have been better..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SDee_13

30,Perhaps somewhat overrated,"Since we saw the signs in the movies, we decided to go and have a look at it. There is nothing spectacular about the sign. You can get really close to it, if you enter ""Lake Hollywood Park"". You can either park at the park or choose to drive little further up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smhr
40,"I loved seeing the Hollywood Sign, just wished I could have gone right up to it...","*I actually went in December 2007, they make you put in a date*I loved seeing the Hollywood Sign. It was so ""Hollywood"". I had a great time looking at it and the view of the city. I would definitely recommend going to it. Take your photos. The view is amazing, breathtaking and over all spectacular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tk1323
50,Great!,"It has always been my dream to see this sign in real life. And I finally did it! It's worth seeing if you like such things. In case you are bored with still-standing monuments, it will be enough for you to look at it from freeway.But I went right to it. It wasn't really hard to find the right way actually. You should just go up and up and up the hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ness0300
40,Great Site!,"Seeing the Hollywood sign was great! We took a tour bus up to the closest spot you can get to in April 2010 to take photos, etc. My only wish is that we could have been closer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsrelly
50,Now I can say I've seen it.,"We visited the sign on a Saturday morning. We snaked through the hills in the car until we found the small park on Canyon Lake Dr. that's meant for viewing. It wasn't very crowded, but people were constantly coming and going. We took a few photos, enjoyed the view, and were on our way. Unless you climb up to the sign, this stop won't take long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EB0320
30,Best place to see the sign in LA,Taking a picture with Hollywood sign is a must do in LA. The best place to take a picture with hollywood sign is Canyon Lake Dr. That's the closest location you can get to the sign by car.,
50,"Great time burner, zero cost","While visiting LA for the Rose Bowl, my daughter wanted to hike up to the HOLLYWOOD sign. We drove to a parking spot in a local park at the bottom of the hill, and left our car. NOTE: Bring water with you. The hike up the hill takes about one hour, if you go all the way to the top. Great views‚Ä¶ nice family time together, and it cost nothing, the best value in L.A.",
40,Fun Hollywood Mission,"Although you don't really go up to it so much, you spend some time driving to the top of a steep Hollywood hill to part and take your photos with the sign. It is a really fun drive up the steep hill twisting and turning around neat houses stacked up tall.Once you get there the top of the hill is packed with tourists all posing in funny angles along with the sign.Pack in a bunch of things to do in one day here, a Hollywood day won't be too long and you can get it all done quickly and it's a good time and well worth it.",
30,parents trip,whilst my son was being taught how to be a better actor they put a trip for the parents.our guide did not say anything but led us up the hill.the first bit is very steep but the rest of the climb was gradual.although its an icon i dont feel its worth the high climb but others would as my other son and wife thought it was great.,
50,The must visit of LA!,"Went here and had some great photos taken, lots of fun and a great hike. A good sunny and breezy LA morning up in the woods, plenty of people mostly tourists and joggers up here, a very chilled environment. Definitely a LA/California Landmark!",
50,Totally Iconic!,"Every trip to LA includes a visit to see the Hollywood Sign. Of course, it can be seen from many areas of Hollywood, but to get closer is a treat. We drive up Beachwood and head into the Hollywood Hills. From there, we will pull over when we find a good spot and vista and take some pictures. Never tire of seeing this iconic symbol!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShopBread
50,One of the Most Iconic signs in the World,It is a must see!! We hiked up to very top of Hollywood sign last weekend and I must admit I thought I was going to die! The place is hard to find and the hike was very steep but very worth every second of it. The only down side was all the horse poop you had to dodge while hiking up to the sign.There is a ranch that offers horseback riding and apparently they are not required to clean up after themselves. Overall a very positive experience and one that should be on everyone's bucket list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ali250
40,Great U.S. Landmark,We received a list of recommended sites after our Warner Brothers studio tour and directions to a photo area for the Hollywood Sign were included. They were directly on the mark and we parked and were able to take several great photos.It was fun and we were definiteily glad that we went!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twosassyk
50,So glad we came here!!,Saw this on tripadvisor and drove up. The address above takes you right up to the viewing point. You can park anywhere on the street as long as you're not facing oncoming traffic! You get a good view of the sign and a good view of the city. Very peaceful. You're not actually within touching distance of the sign. I don't know if you can hike up to it but it's a great viewing point.Glad we came here!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AymanN
40,The films lie. You cannot sit near it.,We drove up to just below the sign where one can park on the road which happens to be infront of people's houses who say they are fed up with their own cars being bashed and being the focus of a huge amounts of tourists all year round. Even cones are laid out and wheeled bins protect their turf. The residents are cool guys though. You can get great photos up top nearby beneath and also hike the trails that go up towards or down away from if you have a couple hours spare and hiking boots etc there are rattlesnakes however and mountain lions and homeless people. In that order of worry for humans. Don't smoke here either as the area is very flammable when hot even in December.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carlos_Yabrudy
50,"Great, but TIRING Hike","Took the hike to the sign today...I'm not gonna lie...it was challenging! But what a view and so cool to be so up close & personal with the legendary Hollywood sign. There are a couple of places online you can find directions to get up there. Just bring some good shoes, some water and STRETCH! It took me about an hour to get to the top. It's steep, but honestly, if I can do it probably anyone can. I'm not in that good of shape!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockstar89
40,Hollywood Sign Rocks,We couldn't find the trail that lead up to the sign itself but doesn't mean it's not there. It was a worthwhile trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/796DavidR

30,More famous than it should be,"Its a very famous place but it doesn't seem like one when going there. There are small roads to the sign and the places for pictures and made very basic, there are not even enough parking lots when its a bit crowded. Some beautiful houses and nature around but thats it. Its ok for taking pictures - but only because its so famous, otherwise I wouldn't have gone there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juleswtal
40,love it,"You can see the Hollywood sign from many places in Hollywood but i think the best place to see it is to drive as close you can get or hike it. The GPS took us down are very narrow road with cars and bins all over the sidewalk. But when we arrived it was well worth it. Its like a dream, seeing it right infront of you.Looking back on my trip - hiking to the sign was one of my favourite things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenna_NZ111
40,Great to say you've seen it,We were on a time limit visiting the sign and did not realise you can not drive anywhere near it. Its below a dirt track that would take a good hike to get a decent picture however there was a spot near the car park you can see it not ideal when wearing flip flops but we managed it. From the carpark turn right on the dirt track go around the corner and youl see a cave diagonally opposite to that is a hill walk up and that's the shortest walking view you can get of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyL98
40,The view is great!,"The drive to get to the sign was a little scary. Google Maps directed us through the scenic route, which was slightly scary! The roads are VERY narrow and the locals are crazy drivers! Obviously, they know how to drive through those roads like a pro, but it was slightly scary going around the curves.Once we got to the sign, the view was beautiful. I highly recommend going to Lake Hollywood Park, 3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90068. It's a local park. The road is very steep...DON'T FORGET TO USE YOUR EMERGENCY BREAK WHEN PARKING! Tourist are not really welcome in other locations; or so I've read from many LA locals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Megnolia07
40,A Relaxing & Pleasant Place,"We drove to 6342 Mulholland Highway, Los Angeles, CA 90068 to have a nice view of the Hollywood sign.Surprisingly, it was a nice and relaxing place to be, away from the traffic and crowds. We had a lovely time and went again on the 2nd day in LA. A great place to picnic as well.Though there is no major attraction except the Hollywood sign, this place calms you down in LA.It is only 5-10 mins drive from Universal Studio, a good stop to go in the morning before visiting Universal Studio.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The-SCH-World-Travel
50,Gotta see it somehow!,"I was definitely giddy when i saw the sign in the distance driving in from san diego. Hollywood had always been my number one place to go on my bucket list and now i was getting to go here!The great thing was, we stayed at the Loews Hollywood Hotel and got a suite that had a view of the hollywood sign. Therefore, I could look at the sign all day and get pictures whenenver and it was awesome! Didnt actually drive close enough to it but i was satisfied with the time i got to look at it and think of all the history in this town. Take a look at it , get close if you can !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve
40,Quintessential Los Angeles,"Although the history and importance of the Hollywood sign isn't what one would expect (some developers put it up to name the area they were building homes in, Hollywoodland), it has now become the trademark symbol for LA. Plus, the city's dedication to keep it well maintained is impressive. I went up to Mount Lee Drive to walk up (more like trespass) the access road and was so glad I did. A great backdrop for pictures with beautiful views over the city!Some of the people that lived on that street weren't happy and rangers had actually come in the close the street down because of their complaints. I guess that's happens when you live at the base of a national landmark! I told him to sell funnel cakes and capitalize on the opportunity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindsayB35
40,The place you must visit in LA,"I found this place on Tripadvisor.When I arrived at the spot, I felt that I made a right decision. I highly recommend that you should take a picture right in front of the Landscape as well as the HOLLYWOOD SIGH. Enjoy the view around then",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/574_2013
40,Bucket list attraction..,"A bucket list item for most people, though there is no official spot to see it. Someone mentioned in their review that 3000 Canyon lake dr is the address of a point that offers good view and it was spot on. But be careful as this is no parking zone. However, it's worth a trip and a memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SidharthA_13
50,Nice souvenir,"If you have a GPS, set in Deronda drive and follow its indications up to there. You'll be at about 100 m from the sign. Enjoy the view and take a photo. On the way up, there is a small parking where you may enjoy a nice overview from LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Francois_Leloup
40,Good to see it,"Was awesome to be able to get a pic of the famous sign in the background, pity we couldn't get a lot closer then the photos we got. Not bad though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skinnyravs
50,Hiked to the top,"Despite varying reviews and posts about how it's illegal to hike to the sign itself and that locals don't like tourists in their neighborhood, we hiked up Mt Lee, behind the sign. It was great exercise and a fantastic view!We stayed in downtown LA for work but took the subway to Hollywood/Vine subway stop then took the Beachwood Canyon Dash bus to the entrance of Hollywoodland. It's a cool community in its own right but if you walk up to the end of N Beachmont Drive there is a parking area and horse stable. You can get to the trail here. Everyone we met was both friendly and helpful with directions. There were many people out walking and hiking. Parts near the top are pretty steep, albeit paved versus the dirt trail at the beginning. Keep your eyes open for horse poop on the dirt part of the trail as it's shared with the horses. It took us about 45 each way from the trailhead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blairz
40,cant miss it!!,"How can you miss it, its the sign, you've seen all this whilewhich takes you to the realm of the moviesyou've seen all your lifeWell you gotta see itI took one of the bus rides staring from the walk of fame& it stopped at several levels, from where you can view itIts fun!!",
40,Very Cool,Really Cool. You can hike up to the sign. And visit the folks in the area. there isnt much to do there.,
40,Gotta see,You can't go to Hollywood and not see the sign. I just saw it from the city sightseeing bus & was worth it as it is a classic icon...,
50,Iconic,We went up on a tour and the view is amazing!!! You can't go near the sign but you can see it clearly from a viewing point. One to visit!,
30,If you are in the area...,The sign is a sign. It is not THAT impressive. You can see it from many places while driving around the area.At night it is not lit up.,
40,ICONIC,"For all the movie fans around the world, this sign is the ""must"" when traveling to LA. I am no exception. It's OK just to look at it from a distant against the mountains and skies. Those Capital Letters stand there with pride and power, manifesting its authority. I had several pictures taken with me in this background. Who wouldn't? I would not travel up to the sign itself. I know people do so. However, I still recommend that staying a little bit distant bring more marvelous effects not only in pictures but also in memories.",
40,hooray for HOLLYWOOD,"Don't miss the opportunity to see the infamous Hollywood sign up close and personal. You cant actually go to the sign, but there are areas in Hollywood where the sign has clear and beautiful views. Some hotels even offer views of the sign from the room. My daughter and I were on a quest ot get the best pictures of the sign based on tours, hair appointments (Awesome view from Chaz Dean Studios) and dining establishments. Best of all, this attraction is absolutely free.",
50,Makes me smile,"My perspective of the Hollywood sign might be slightly different; I live in Hollywood, below the Hollywood sign. It's a wonderful neighborhood, and after traveling, when I see the sign, it means I'm almost home. I love traveling, seeing new places, so I am okay with tourists to LA who come to our neighborhood, double park their cars, stand in the middle of the street (blocking traffic even more) and take pictures holding up the sign. I even offer to take their pictures so they can all be in the photo together, if I'm walking along the street at the same time.In the past we've been told that to get to the Hollywood sign one must travel over private property so it is not allowed - but I understand there are now public hiking trails to the back of the sign. If you want to hike it, please be considerate and use the public trails!",
40,classic view,"when you think of holllywood this is undoubtably the place that you think of. and it doesn't disappoint. you cant get very close to it but if you drive up deronda drive there are some great views of it. you just have to be careful as to where you can stop as understandable there are lots of restrictions as people live here which you obviously have to respect, but definitely the best view of the sign I have found!",
40,Must do,You haven't been in LA without seeing the Hollywood sign. It's like visiting Paris without seeing the Eiffel Tower.Would like to go hiking there!,
50,I've got movie issue,"That's why I've always wanted to visit this place, and got there on a cloudy day, feel really different and excited, there's a small grass field which is heaven for puppies and a lot of people from movie industry are location scouting for new films. the only downside I think for this spot is, you got to drive quite long distance on the mountain with a lot of residence and if you're not that familiar with the neighborhood, it almost feels like you are wondering around in peoples backyard.",
50,squeezed all the way up there!,"was driving Nissan pathfinder I wasn't used to and these streets are as narrow as can be! would hate to live there and have all these tourists coming thru like me and so many others! you climb and climb and the sign gets closer and closer until you finally suddenly get as far as u can and have to make a turnaround! saw some guys parking their car and continuing by foot but know that's illegal, well worth the trip up there!",
50,omg love this place,"OMG I really enjoyed hiking here with my family. It was the first time being here having so many fun. My kids were very excited that for the first time they were going to see the Hollywood letters and take pictures, I recommend this place.",
50,so happy i did this hike!,"when i found out about this hike, i just had to get to LA ASAP and do it! i was able to park in the lot, although if that is full- there was plenty of parking in the neighborhood just below the lot. the lot and street was all free so no worries of having to pay someone, or a meter. the hike is a little confusing- we had to ask some people along the way, and then some people asked us on our way down. i can tell you that the 1st weird spot you get to where you can go two different ways- make a sharp left. its almost a u-turn but it takes you up a hill and around. the next fork- go right. i think that was pretty much it as far as turns go. there are plenty of people along the way to ask though. once you get to the top, its such an awesome view- and getting the back of the letters in my photographs such a cool thing to me. (im a nerd?). definitely take a panoramic pic of the sign when you get up there, otherwise you won't get the whole thing.the ""hike"" was super easy for me and i not athletic at all. it's very uphill which is tiring, but i never had to stop at all. i just got out of breath, but it was not that bad. even going down is a little tricky because a lot of it is dirt, so be careful. it took us 45 min to get up there (joggers and runners will be a lot faster- i only walked). i was up there for 30 min taking pictures and stuff, and then it took 30 min to get down.I definitely think everyone should do this hike- it was one of my favorite things i've done.",
50,Great hike and scenary,We started at the end of Canyon Dr where there is a parking lot and hiked up to behind the Hollywood sign. With some stops for pictures it took about an hour to get there. The view is terrific!! Recommend going to the bathroom first and bring water.,
50,Finally I saw it for real.,It was interesting to see the sign in person instead of on TV or in the movies. I was surprised to find that this is only part of the original Hollywoodland sign.,
50,Great place,"This sign becomes much more popular then it was couple years ago. Some days it is crowded, and sometimes you are on your own on the top of the hill!!!There is nothing special about it, but the area is very nice and picturesque. If you have time, walk along the path to the top of the hill, the views are amazing! I also liked just walking around in the neighborhood. All the houses are so different and beautiful. The lake nearby has a great view, too.",
30,Nothing to get excited about!,"I suppose if you're in L.A. then it's a must see, but after all it's only a sign that most of us have seen time after time in many different travel programmes and movies. Best seen from the Griffith Observatory.",
50,Must See Sign,"If you are in LA, you need to check out this landmark. My friend picked me up at my hotel, and she drove us to the Hollywood Sign. We ended up taking this windy road up the mountain through a very beautiful neighborhood. The road to get to the sign is very narrow so please use caution when driving there.",
50,Worth the trip,"Start at the Hollywood Reservoir and walk the 3.5 miles around the lake on the paved path. Great views of the Hollywood Sign, Hollywood and Downtown L.A. It's also a nice, serene walk. The head up Lake Hollywood Drive, past the dog park to the Hollywood Sign/Hollywood overlook. Park on the street or in one of the turnouts. Great scenic view of Hollywood, the sign and downtown L.A.Head up the road as far as you can go to get super close to the sign.",
50,The Most Famous Icon in the World that Nobody Visits,"The Hollywood sign is the symbol of Los Angeles, the entertainment industry, and is an icon that represents the dreams of every person who moves to southern California to start an acting career. What's funny is that it's tricky to visit. First of all, you have to hike there, and it's not that straightforward to access the trailheads for it. Second, it's important to recognize that the hike is moderately strenuous, and the weather can get very hot very early. Third, it's easy to make a wrong turn and to get scared to death taking the wrong trail up. If you understand all these, issues, it's well worth your while to make the hike and stand above the world's most famous truncated advertisement for a housing development.There are a few different ways to access the trail to the Hollywood sign, but the shortest one is at Sunset Ranch. One nice but longer hike (about 3 miles each way) is to start at Griffith Observatory and take the dirt road all the way over, but the easiest way to get there is to go up Gower St (which is accessible from the 101 Freeway), go one block to the east to Beachwood at some point, drive up the hill, and park somewhere, being careful to respect the neighborhood residents who are always griping about visitors messing up their gardens or mailboxes. You'll probably have to walk uphill some more to get to Sunset Ranch and the trailhead.At one point, the dirt road meets a paved road, and it's important to make a right turn to get to the sign. The road winds around the back of Mt. Lee (the name of the hill that the sign is on) and offers a great view of the San Fernando Valley and the San Gabriel Mountains before it takes you above the sign and to the peak. Jumping the fence is prohibited, but the road offers a good opportunity for photos by the backsides of the letters.Here's what happens if you turn left on the road, which you shouldn't do. The road goes downhill to a residential area. At one point, there is a dirt trail that goes up the hill and eventually leads to the ""D"" of the Hollywood sign. The trail is steep, gravelly, and slippery. As you go up the trail, there's a fence that says ""No Trespassing."" People who continue past the fence (and people do this every weekend) will eventually hear a loud, amplified voice demanding that they turn back immediately. Sometimes an LAPD helicopter will sweep by as well and take your picture.The dirt roads and trails leading up to the Hollywood sign (other than the illegal route) are quite popular, so it's best to start early. The parking lot at Griffith Park is often full by 7:30am, and you might also have to do a significant amount of walking up Beachwood Ave to get to the Sunset Ranch trailhead. Be sure to wear good walking shoes and to bring water. The Hollywood Hills can get hot very quickly, even in the winter, and I have seen many visitors try to walk up the trails completely unprepared. Also, there are no bathrooms on the trail, but facilities are available at both the Griffith Observatry and Sunset Ranch trailheads.",
50,viewed from Barndell Park,"10.13.2013 - took these photos of the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign from Barnsdall Park after visiting""beyond Eden"" - a great multi-gallery event celebrating the New Contemporary art scene at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. Check them out sometime. They have good stuff. Free admission.",
40,Viewing,"You can drive all around Hollywood to get a good view, but my favorites are from the Kodak Theater and also going up to Mulholland Drive and taking the curvy roads to some great view points!",
50,Must see in Hollywood,"Despite the sign itself, when you go that high in the city you get an amazing view of the city, dog park nearby and axing properties.If you're in town and never been there you should. Its once in a lifetime thing",
30,"Has to be seen, a shame you cant get close to it.","Well what can I say about the sign, it's a landmark. It was nice to see what we see in the movies. Some beautiful houses to be seen in the surrounding areas depending on the route or tour you take, Nice photo taken for memory but 'that's all folks'",
40,Fun to see this significant cultural landmark!,What more to say about the famous Holllywood sign? You know what it looks like. It's visible from all around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnK662
40,LOOONG HIKE,"I asked a park ranger if I could hike up to the Hollywood sign. He pointed me in the right direction and told me I would come up behind the sign. He also told me it would be a 15 min hike.Well the 15 min. is really 1.5 hours. on an incline. I am so not in shape but I did it!!! Bring comfy shoes and a bottle of water. But definetly do it once. When you get to the top there isn't really a good view of the sign, because you are behind it. But there is a great view of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katriciav
50,THAT IS A MUST,An amaizing view. We have been there from Germany and my kids were asking to go there. We have agreed with a nice and frank cab driver to go there as sightseeing traffic making that picture people living there do not like but all was fine and great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ttecgmbh
40,Got a great close up View,"I decided to find my own way to get a good view of the Hollywood Sign, and the best place I found was from next to the Sunset Ranch Hollywood Stables on 3400 N Beachwood Dr. in Griffin Park. The track you walk up after parking is rather dusty, but it is a far better view from up here than it is from any of the tour operators vantage points. Limited parking and you need a car to get there as rather far to walk. So glad I explored the area to find this vantage point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yorkie1948
30,Fun tourist sight,"Not much to say about the sign. It's fun to see, because it is so famous. Interesting to note that it has been the target of some pranks over the years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chessie22
20,Its just a sign,"Nothing really special about this, pleased we saw it but left feeling a bit ""meh"". The day we went, we had to wait a long time to get a park near to go to the look out on Mulholland Drive. Our tour guide wasn't the best so this may have contributed to us leaving the look out thinking that it's just a sign, nothing else!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Livelivefamilytravel
50,Dunn Comes to Hollywood,"What a great view from the top of the hill, once arrived I did noticed some deer down below that was pretty nice, I took lots of photos and a few videos. Watch out for the cactus plants all along the side..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dunnonsite
40,Something to see....Once,"We thought since we drove all the way to LA, we should make the effort to see the Hollywood sign.I did the research and found the best route to drive to the observatory.Hiking was not a possibility with a 19 month old. The drive was scenic to the observatory, but forget about being able to park and go in, or being able take a walk on the sidewalk and enjoy the view.The parking lot was filled with people and their dogs enjoying the free shade. We drove around the parking lot while taking pictures out the window. Yes we saw the sign, and it was something to see, but I won't bother again on the next trip .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelusa1113
40,It was a must see,"This was something I had planned on seeing for years . I went to the observation deck and saw it not very good for taking pictures, so if you have time to get closer and walk up to it do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyC781
20,Hollywood sign,Bit disappointing. Poor access and. OT even lit up at night. Has to be done on the tick list but that is all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertaw706
40,Just to have seen it,"I had a rental car which I learned was very convenient to see places in LA. Someone told me it's difficult to get there without a car. I didn't go all the way up because it was a little hard to find which road went to the top,but I went to an observation area which had a museum and a telescope you could use at night to look at the stars and stuff which was pretty cool. Good view of the sign although a little far away. You can see the sign from most places around Hollywood. It was pretty cool, and free so why not.",
40,The icon of Hollywood.,"Technically I didn't get to go to the physical site of the sign. I went to the Hollywood and Highland and took pictures from the observation deck. If you are in Hollywood, this is one of the better vantage point to take pictures from.",
40,Iconic Sign,"Who does not want to be photographed with the Iconic HOLLYWOOD sign ? it is the first thing on a tourist's mind while visiting LA. It is visible from most parts of the Hollywood. But the Sad part is that most Tour Companies don't Bother to take Tourists close to the Attractions. I was stuck with Starline and was quite disappointed that they do not go very close to it. As I had not much time left for the day , and I could not figure out how to do it on my own, could not visit the Actual place where the sign is. Just wanted those closeup Photos so badly.anyone going for the fiurst time or with a tour company , must ensure that the Tour Co. will actually take you physically to the Sign (if you need to) or must plan beforehand to do it on your own.",
40,Wonderful View,"Our first view of the Hollywood sign was at the Dolby Theatre Plaza, but we wanted a closer look! So,we decided on driving up the hills to see it...I had already researched the GPS location, which was N34.12562, W118.32618. The drive up was very tight at times, so take it slow and carefully. It was also busier than we expected, but the views are wonderful once you get there!",
40,WOW,"Wow, this is soooo USA and L.A. ish. We drove our own car up some curvey roads and ended almost up at the sign. Don't settle with StarLine-tours, drive up there yourself if possible.",
50,A Must Visit Global Landmark While In LA!,"When we landed in LA for our holiday, the 3 things we absolutely did not want to miss out on, were the trips to Universal Studios, Disneyland and this Hollywood sign. Yeah!! Well in the end we did all three! And will do it again the next time.The 'Hollywood Sign' which is a landmark and American cultural icon in the Hollywood Hills area of Mount Lee, Santa Monica Mountains, in Los Angeles, California. The sign spells out the name of the area in 45-foot-tall (14 m)and 350-foot-long (110 m) white letters. It was created as an advertisement in 1923, but garnered increasing recognition after the sign was left up. The sign is located on the southern side of Mount Lee in Griffith Park, north of the Mulholland Highway. The sign is located on rough, steep terrain, and is encompassed by barriers to prevent unauthorized access.Be sure your camera is charged and one has water and nourishment in plenty. There is no need to trek up when with kids, they wont be able to handle it. In fact they look at you with queer amazement, when the adults gasp at the first sight of this iconic sign. Little do they know, this is the symbol of what we have come to associate with the best movies in the world.If one plans a trek, as a few of our friends did, they advised ensuring one has some great gripping shoes, water, morning time, sandwich and a trash collection bag. Go early to find parking at the trailhead. There is mercifully an unwritten code, among visitors here, like in many great destinations, where groups and couples wait and help take photos of other groups, in return for the favour of being clicked together. This way no one needs to be missing from any visiting group, on account of handling the camera. I feel it is worth the trip, to get clicked in front of 'H O L L Y W O O O D""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dpurushothamanp
50,Must go,It takes a bit to go up there but it's worth seeing it if you in the area.Im not sure how would that be to walk but we drove and its good scene driving up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Denyskar
50,Behind the sign,"We took the walk up behind the Hollywood sign on a very hot and sunny afternoon! We didn't expect it to be so far (we started at a horse ranch) but it was well worth it! Once you get to the top and behind the sign the views are magnificent and we where really glad we did it! You can't really get a photo of the hole sign unless you use the panoramic feature but it looks wicked if you do :) we where very temped to climb the fence and go right up to it, but we didn't haha. Luckily as there are cameras everywhere and on our decent a police car drove up obviously someone had jumped the fence! Definitely recommend going up being the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898juliam
40,'HOLLYWOOD' Sign,"Thanks to tips from great friends, our hike up to the Hollywood sign in the Spring of 2013 was amazing. Getting there can be tricky. Parking can be tricky. The path can be tricky! Parking... be careful, not much and private property abound. The path, follow up until it forks... take the path that curves to the LEFT! Then when the road comes to a 'T' take a RIGHT! Once up to the top of the sign, one will see 'WARNING' signs everywhere and a controlled fenced in area, if you look to your left, you will see a little path... take it! THAT'S THE TOP! We saw a lot of people just stop at the secured gated area and turn around... miss the most amazing view by not going up what looks like just a little tiny dirt path! No signs saying this way or that way! Not for elderly or people with bad knees, shortness of breath, smokers, children under the age of 10 years old I would say, unless they are good with nature, hiking, just walking up a fairly long path, up hill, can pay attention... it's a long fall down in any given area! Take WATER, at least 2 per person! There are no water stations and no toilets! Look for the Hummingbirds that are plentiful... and hope you don't see a mountain lion! ;-) It took my husband and I about an hour and a half for both ways, down is breeze of course! Try to make it on clear, low smog day for L.A., in order to see all the great points, beautiful... enjoyed it, would do it all the time if I lived there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michfaldo
50,Hiked to the top. Awesome views.,My boyfriend and i hiked to the top. The views were INCREDIBLE. Wear comfortable shoes and bring water and your camera.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927sarahy
50,Hollywood!,"Seeing the Hollywood sign makes you feel at ""home"" when visiting Hollywood! One can observe it from various angels. Either when walking the city or running in the hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Farmer107
30,Just a sign,"That's just a sign + good views, so can't expect a lot. Fun to go all way up there. We drove, and it was no place to park, and we couldn't even stop, which was pretty lame, especially to take pictures through the window. There were some people standing outside and it was tight. It's not a must see to me, but hey, that's one of the things that L.A. is famous for.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trucizna007
50,Hike from Bronson Caves Park,"We used the trail from the Bronson Caves in Griffith Park to get up behind the Hollywood sign and used this address in our GPS to get there: 3200 Canyon Drive, Griffith Park, Los Angeles, CA 90068If yo have any questions you can call (323) 666-5046 to talk to the Park Maintenance Supervisor.PARKING:There is a large parking lot on the right, but you can drive up a little ways and there is a smaller parking lot on the left that is at the start of the trailhead. There is no fee to park.HOURS:5 am to dusk. We were coming down from the Caves right at dusk, there was a park ranger in a truck blaring a siren, and announced that the park was closing. They are serious about closing at dusk, and will close the gate even if your car is still there. You better hustle down that mountain when you hear the siren.BRONSON CAVES HIKE:The trail on the right leads to the Bronson Caves (where the original Batman TV series was filmed) very cool to see, and seriously is only a 10 minute walk roundtrip. (2/3 of a mile with a 50 ft elevation gain) Very easy hike, your little ones will be able to do it. Dogs must be on a leash, and no bikes are allowed.HOLLYWOOD SIGN HIKE:It took us 3 hours roundtrip to do this hike. We got there at 5pm (we specifically went later in the day since there is NO shade on this hike). The 3 hours included us spending some time up top on the sign, and we also took a lot of stops going up the mountain as we had a friend with a gimpy foot (sprained ankle w/ a possible hairline fracture). Although I don't recommend doing that as her foot was the size of Jay Leno's face at the end of this hike and even Baskin Robbins couldn't bring her out of her bad mood... But my point is, if she can do it, you most certainly can do this hike too.From the parking lot just go straight....there is a barrier to keep cars out that you'll have to go around. The first fork in the trail, go left. Going right will take you to the Observatory. The second split in the trail, keep right. Going down on the left leads to the Ranch where you can find a very nice looking cowboy guide with a southern drawl. It may be worth it for you check that out. The third and final fork you will go right, it seems like you are almost there but you still have a little bit of ways to go and this is probably the steepest part of the hike. Don't forget to sign the fence on your way up (No worries, you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it)THE SIGN:It is fenced off, and you can't actually touch the sign, there are a bazillion cameras, and warning signs, and barbed wire. There is a tiny trail to the tippy top of the mountain and I recommend you go up that as you can be on top of the sign and the view is absolutely stunning of LA. There were quite a few other people there too, so you'll be able to ask others to take a picture of your group. There was a lot of litter up there too, don't be an arrogant donkey face, take care of your trash, there are some sporadically placed trash cans along the trail.WHAT TO BRING & WATCH OUT FOR:Water....bring water bottles! I brought a small hiking backpack, and put 2 water bottles in and went through both of them. Bring your camera. Bring a pen/marker to sign the fence. There are no restrooms and it is a highly populated trail, go to the bathroom before you start. We saw a tarantula (maybe not but the spider was ginormous) rabbits, and lizards. We also came upon another group of hikers yelling at the top of there lungs and what sounded like a river flowing... it was actually a rattlesnake and it was not very happy. Please be aware of your surroundings and keep your dogs on a leash. Accidents do happen, stay on the trail, and don't go over the barriers that line the cliff's edge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeksTravel
40,"Classic must see in LA, hard to find","It's actually quite hard to find a nice view of the sign, but with our navigation system we were lead to as close as we could get to the sign as possible, with a small road leading up to it. The view of the sign is nice, as expected. So overall, visiting a nice spot to view the sign is recommended, but should be planned in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thijsmm
40,felt like a superstar,What would a visit to Los Angeles be without getting the picture opportunity of the famous Hollywood sign in it. Yes thanks to the info online we drove up to beechwood dr and followed the narrow steep hill road to get what i thought was the best pictures with the sign in the backround,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsladylee
40,Visit a Classic while in the LA area,"A bit hard to get to, as you need to drive up 2 winding streets with very little parking when you get to the top - but definitely worth the visit. We went midday - I assume if you go earlier in the day, this is a much better deal. Really worth the drive - wear comfortable shoes and bring a good camera. Can't hike up to the sign anymore but seeing it from 1000 feet away is just as good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YayeMama
30,A must see?,"Maybe it's a ""must see"" when you are visiting Hollywood but you just need to find the best spot for that. I only had to see it from the Dolby Theater and while I was driving or visiting Hollywood's area by car or by bus. That was enough for me. I didn't go to a special place just only to see this sign clearer. At night, the sign disappear. It should be lighted up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hedddo

40,H O L L Y W O O D,A lot of areas to get some nice pictures. Other than that........eh depends on how many photos and areas you are willing to pull off at and take pictures. Some really beautiful houses in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202michaela
20,Just a sign (unless you are a mythomaniac),"The Hollywood sign is..just a sign..big letters on a barren hill. If it wasn't because the letters spell Hollywood and in our collective unconscious it spells glamour,, nobody would pay attention to it, If you just see it for what it is, not for what it represents, (I can't help looking at it this way), then it is not worth the trouble,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariana60
40,easy to spot,Easy to see iconic sign from many locations in Hollywood. Easy to see from observation area of the Highland/Hollywood Blvd mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangojohnDallas
40,You have to say you saw it right ?,What is a visit to Los Angeles / Hollywood without securing a photo of the Hollywood sign to show the friends and family ?A great place to see the sign is from the walkway at the Highland Center mall .No hiking required .Another great vantage without risking life and limb is from the Mulholland Drive look outI'm all about the photo without the risk ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
40,Can't miss it!,"If you've never been to LA, it is an amazing attraction. Even though I didn't go hicking inside the park, I just drove the regular way and go there with the help of a gps. The sign is far but the point os sight seeing is very pretty, you can also have take a very good look at the city from there.You'll know when to stop when you see a lot of turists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seraphyne
40,Visit it through Lake Hollywood Park,You can have a good view of Hollywood Sign from this park. Actually there will be a lot of dogs there and be prepared to meet them accidentally. You can park the car along the street just outside the park. And I think you can drive along Canyon Lake Dr and Mulholland Hwy to have a better shot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xiangjund2017
40,"If your in Hollywood, you must get close to the sign","This is a must if your in Hollywood, luckily I drove there from Vegas so had the car, punched in Hollywood sign into the TomTom GPS and it took me up into the hills into a residential dead-end right beside the sign. Grabbed some snaps then got on my merry way. It is just a sign after all.The view from Holly Boulevard is rubbish and you cannot get a decent picture, so make the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dimenion3
50,Awesome for what it is,"It's awesome to see it. You can see it from lots of place but the size doesn't kick in until you get up in the hills some. You can see it on Hollywood Blv but doesn't do it justice. Drive up the hills some, different spots, lots of curves, narrow roads, and takes awhile but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
50,Awesome hike if you're 16-40 years old and in decent shape,Drive up beechwood till it ends . There will be street parking near the enterance to the trails. There are spots to view the sign 200ft away if you're not that into hiking or hike to the top and see the sign from behind it (not recommended to bring kids). On the way up you end up on the road that goes to the top of Mount Lee and you get a view of the San Fernando Valley and at the top you see all of Los Angeles. It's pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjconr
50,Hollywood!!!,Gotta love the sign! No matter what angle you see it at its just a warm feeling with great pictures! LA wouldn't be the same without It,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlingBelle
50,Cool photo,Went up the hills for a great picture with the sign. Makes an awesome holiday photo with the sign right behind you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauren1710
50,Definitely a must while in LA,"You can hike up to see the sign up close but really....you can see it from alot of places without having to hike, gives you more time to explore other parts of LA. Best place we found for a photo is at the Hollywood/Highland centre - you can park here for $2 for 4 hours, you just need to get your ticket validated and one of the shops, we just brought a drink inside - not sure what it costs if you dont get it validated. They then have balconies that you can go on that give you an awesome view of the Hollywood sign. Got some awesome pics within 5 mins then could go straight to walk of fame rather than hiking for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassie-Andy
40,Take the hike and take a picture,"There are a lot of hikes and different locations sporting closer and better angles of the Hollywood sign than the ones that you might see from the observatory.Take the time and make sure to take a picture that you'll have for years, or to send home to family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
40,PLEASE READ - LOST CAMERA 7/19/2013,"Hopefully, someone who has found our camera will read this. After taking a couple pictures my niece took the camera and put it down somewhere on the hill. I only want the photos that were on the memory card. We were there on 7/19/2013 between 10am -2pm. I will pay the shipping costs for the memory card, you can keep the camera as a reward. Very important pictures on it of family, etc. please email me: beaux004 @ yahoo. com (that's zero zero four ; no spaces). Thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bueaux
50,Uphill hike to the Hollywood sign,"An iconic symbol of Hollywood & definitely worth a visit. We hiked up through the Hollywoodland hills houses & ended up getting really close to the sign, which made for great photo opportunities. It's also really interesting to look at all the different houses in the hills as you walk up to the sign. Worth the uphill walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lrnnnn
50,Hollywood Sign Photo Op,"Found a good way to get up here and thought I would share. Drive to the intersection of Franklin Avenue and Beechwood in Los Angeles. This is about 3 blocks North of the Hollywood Blvd. (The Walk of Fame with all the stars). Drive up Beechwood all the way and you will find free parking at the top by Griffith Park. It's a short climb up a dirt trail to an unobstructed lookout point up to the front of the sign. If you want to hike more after seeing the sign, bring hiking shoes, water and a hat or sunscreen; there's no shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atthetastingroom
50,Don't drive there--hike it!!,"We hiked the Hollyridge Trail to get the view from behind the sign--much cooler than seeing it from Mullholland Drive. The Trail itself is about 4 miles round trip with some great views of the city. From the backside, you can see universal studios and the Disney lot. From the front, you can see all Hollywood has to offer. Get there early as parking is limited. My boyfriend and I ran part of the trail and would have ran more had we not brought our camera bag. Bring a bottle of water and sunscreen--and camera of course!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volvol16
50,Iconic Sign,It is what it is - An iconic Sign that you see in films and on Tv and somewhere I have always wanted to go. There are some great little roads leading up to the hills of the sign that take you in and around the bottom of the sign. Once you park up and take a walk up to the sign it offers you some rat views across LA. Lots of locals go running aorund there and on a warm day you can relax and enjoy the views. Glad I done it and another tick in the box.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fonseca-Denning
50,Great photostop with Hollywood sign,"It was worth a stop of 10 mins to capture really good photographs with HOLLYWOOD sign. One can not get any better picture with HOLLYWOOD sign than here. Must see...! But watch the roads, quite narrow n wawy roads up the mountain area...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/71gulnazk
30,"Tough to see the sign up close, but this hike takes you above it.","There are several ways to hike to the Hollywood sign. The one from the Park is about 2 mileslong and takes about an hour if you're in shape. If you're not in shape, don't even attempt this route as it's up a steep incline most of the way. To get to the parking area from Hollywood Blvdin Hollywood - coming from the center of Hollywood take a left on Bronson Rd - take it to the end and then left on Canyon. The park entrance will be less than a mile away straight ahead. Go through the gates and park in the dirt lot on the right. Then walk straight up the rod and the path will lead you straight up towards the sign. When you get to the end of the 1st path take a left - this leads to a paved rd - take a R and go straight up this road - which leads to the plant above the Hollywood Sign. There are multiple views of the sign along this route which also gives beautiful views of the entire area. At the very top of the road you get to a locked fenced-in area - keep going up the dirt hill for the best viewing. You can see the top of letters which spell out ""HOLLYWOOD"", but this is not the Hollywood sigh - which has huge letters some 30 feet wide each and over 40 feet in height. This shows you where the sign is below, but it can't be seen from the very top. Also check out the Bronson Caves - which is up the path to the left just before you reach the parking area. Have fun!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knightline
30,"Okay so the sign says Hollywood, not impressed","Like all those who happen to get to LA for a visit, my family wanted to drive as close to the sign as possible. At the end of the day, it's just a sign, and sadly the place it represents was filthy, filled with homeless and beggers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wkrupa
40,Can't come to Southern Cali without visiting the sign,"Had to get pictures of the iconic HOLLYWOOD signLots of winding roads to get to a point that you could actually snap a good picture but well worth the tripMust seeWould I go back again?Yes, sure. I would come back to see it again. The first time is way cool",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Douglas8098
50,great,"we hired a limo to take us up to the sign wifes 50th lovely drive and nice views of the iconic sign. nice area of Hollywood.. got some great photo,s met some lovely people",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jk11_11
50,Mandatory,"Again, with the Walk of fame, this is a must too.You must drive up to 3000 Canyon Lake Drive to get the best photo of the sign, but it is worth the effort to fight the winding roads leading to it!Not so many people are there, but this is absolutely the best photo spot. It offers a good view of downtown LA, and the Hollywood reservoir.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/561d_nielf
40,Finally we saw the real thing,"Me and my family travelled 14 hours fligt to Los Angeles, we wanted to see as much as possible. Especially we are Hollywood movies fans! Actually it's not interesting drove up as the road was narrow and single, some areas you can't see opposite car, drive slowly and carefully. Not much to see as the mountain just a residential area. Some reviews said old famous stars lived here, which we don't know so not special to us. But when we got close the sign we were happy coz we finally did it and thing uses to see on tv, was got so close in front of us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickyplusEric
30,STUPID to drive up to THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.,"The Hollywood sign is in a residencial neighborhood on a hillside. Nothing to see close-up!!!! You have to view the sign from below, miles away to see it. Some people are to DUMB, they drive up a steep mountain road, to see nothing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusannP434
40,A nice hike and view,"It's fun to take the hike up to the sign from griffith park, bring a buddy though. Those trails are kinda scary, especially at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stockweb
50,Must do when visiting LA,"Definitely have to have your photo taken with the Hollywood sign. Plenty of places or advantage points in which to do it. Plenty of tours in Hollywood offer this as part of their tour. If you don't have a car or do a tour, you can go to the Hollywood and Highland Centre, and you can actually see the sign from there to take some photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliBla
40,Must See,"You've seen it in movies so why not experience the real thing. We drove up Mulholland Drive and stopped along the way and took a great photo. We hear you cannot get very close as you could in the past. Can't be missed. You can see the sign from many areas in LA, like Dodger Stadium. We took our photo right near Ron Howards home. Was really cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
50,"This is the ""Mount Rushmore"" for Los Angeles",This is something most of us have seen all of our lives in movies etc. We were to driven up on Mullholland Dr to view the sign. Our driver stopped just below where Wilt Chamberlain used to live to take the picture. I liked it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melaniem467
40,Must see and from any angle.,"This is nice to see live, from the streets below in Hollywood you'll find a lot of spots from streets to take a good picture. There is also a hike trail starting at a parking lot at the end of N Beachwood Drv, which brings you in 30mins or so to the top and behind the sign. Make sure your camera can do panorama pics to get all on the foto. It's worth but was totally crowded on saturday morning at 10am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKBuddy
40,Great Hike,"This is a great hike, it's not that it's challenging but it definitely gives you a different and unique view during your hike or run. Come in comfortable clothes. If you can go during ""business hours"" it wont be as packed as it is after 5pm",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
30,Saw the sign whilst in LA,Our tour driver made a stop for us near the Hollywood sign during our day trip around LA which included Hollywood and Beverley Hills.We took a couple of snaps and added our name to those who have already visited LA and the Hollywood sign.Normally see this on the TV screen and so it made a bit of change seeing it in person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zamyhussain
50,good to see,you can only see this from certain places in Hollywood. you get a good view from the Highland centre where you can also park your car for about $4 if you get a receipt from certain shops and eatery's we went in Starbucks In the highland if you make your way to the stars at the front and go up the steps to the bridge you get a good view of the sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kr117
40,"It's There, You are in La, You Should See It...","Not much to comment here. Every body has seen this sing on movies or TV shows. If you are in LA, it is worth it to drive by the area and take your picture with this famous icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Arlyn1
50,Iconic sign & stellar views,"We saw the Hollywood sign from Canyon Lake Drive, which was an awesome spot. The road leads to an area with several vantage points to take photographs. Also, in one area you can stop and take pictures of the Hollywood Sign, downtown Los Angeles, and the reservoir. I must say that I've always seen this sign in movies so it was pretty darn cool to see it in person. Obviously if you're in the LA area this should be on your list of things to see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TruthfulCritic85
50,Have to do this at least once,"Everyone should have this on their bucket list. You see it in the movies, but nothing like seeing it in person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/892GaryW
50,Dreamed of this,Ive dreamed of seeing this sign since I was a lttle girl. I took pictures of it everywhere we went. A must see if you are going to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716lynnb
40,"Come on, get close","We hiked the trails from the observatory. It was hot and no shade. It was well worth the hike. Make sure you have good hiking shoes hat and water. Don't let the rattle snake signs scare you off. As you climb up, the Hollywood sign appears to change to other names like 'illywoo' depending on your angle. It's really fun and the views are fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plastx2
40,fun weekend hike,"After years of living in Southern California (and only seeing the sign from a distance), a group of friends and I decided to make the hike up to the top. It was an enjoyable Saturday morning, and I would suggest this activity to visitors who enjoy hiking and would like to see this iconic sign up close. From the top you can enjoy views of the city, the skyline and the Griffith Observatory (lovely even amidst the smog). The actual sign is fenced off to the public but there are various points on the trail for good photo opportunities. A few things to remember: the trail has very little shade so if you are planning to hike in the summer or late spring go early and don't forget to bring plenty of water and sunscreen. Also, there are no bathrooms at the trailhead or anywhere on the trail so keep that in mind. Parking is limited at the trailhead and the road you drive up is very narrow which makes it difficult for cars to pass each other. Arrive early for the best chance to get a close parking spot and to avoid the heat if you plan to hike during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdmorrison
40,A memory maker,"The first time I saw the HOLLYWOOD sign was back in the 1990s when I came down with my partner to do some business with Cannell Films. The business deal did not work out, but the memory of seeing the sign has lingered all these years. I am back in L.A. on holiday now and when ever I drive anywhere I keep an eye open for that iconic reminder of a fascinating place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buckyboyincanada
30,It's a big sign that says 'HOLLYWOOD'. Do you need to see it.....,"No I don't think so. If you have grown up intrigued by Hollywood and all that glam then I think you will be a little disappointed by the sign. It's not as big as it's made out to be. Not a surprise really.I think if you want to see Hollywood go down sunset boulevard, drop in on an acting class. Sit and have a coffee in Hollywood. Even go and feel the energy of Universal studios... but the sign is just a big sign. Nothing more nothing less. It won't blow up or tell you a story it will just be a sign forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebackandforth
40,Best places to see the Hollywood Sign,"Built in 1923 to advertise a new housing community in the Chinatown section of Los Angeles, it originally read, ""Hollywoodland."" It would light up the night sky and quickly became a well known landmark. While it was only built to stand 18 months it has been updated and revitalized many times over the past 90 years. As for taking a photo of this beloved sign there are 5 noteworthy vantage points to get your best shot:1) Hollywood and Highland - a shopping center with viewing areas set up2) Beachwood Drive - a neighborhood with limited parking but great group photo op (Where this phot was taken)3) Griffith Observatory - Just a short way up the main trail head4) Deronda Drive - Difficult to get to, but best photos5) Dante's Park - just north of Griffith park, different vantage point",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrivenMeg
50,Best place to take picture with the Hollywood Sign,"If you want to take some good pictures with the Hollywood Sign, YOU MUST COME HERE!!! Although the road was not easy to drive up there, but will worth it. We follow the GPS get into the tiny one way road with many cars park at the side. We were driving around and around all the way up to the hill. We stay there for like an hour to take some of crazy and beautiful pictures with the sign and the view of LA. We drove up to the hill, and some of us take a walk back down there to the street. We saw some of the nice houses and gardens, make us want to reside there. Just one reminder, if you are really decide to walk down the hill, you must dress comfort with a sneaker! ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
40,Short & Sweet,"Use the address provided to go to a nice quiet spot to view the sign, free parking, only ever about 6-8 cars parked there & you get a nice clear view of the sign without worrying about annoying the locals who live there & hate the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jables89
30,Something to say you've seen,We were in Hollywood and checked out the iconic sign. I have seen it so many times on T.V. I felt it would be a sin to at least not take a minute to check it out. Surprisingly they do not light it up at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dcaillier
40,Wasn't planning on writing a review about the H sign but...,"I just stayed in LA for a month, and just ran across a Bad Review for the H sign because of Fog --- Really??I can assure you that on most days --- you can actually see the H sign without driving up into the Hollywood Hills LOL.Please note that Hollywood residents would rather tourists NOT drive up into the hills. To see the H sign when you're in Hollywood --- Just LOOK UP.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rollngstone
50,Must See,This is one site that is a must see if in the area as it's part of history. It was nice to finally be able to see it and look at all the houses built in the hills. There were quite a few people in the area taking pictures but it didn't take that long to get our pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hafor
10,"CANT SEE IT, TOO FOGGY","LOL~~What a joke. It is just a wooden sign on a hill. We thoght this was a ""MUST SEE"" to complete our Calif trip, It is so foggy most of the time that you can not see it. To even get close you have to drie up hill for about 1/2 hour thru private streets and tehn you can not see the sign. We asked a very nice man, ""Sir, can you please tell us wehre is the HOLLYWOOD sign "". He said it is right here (literally above our head) but you can never see it as it is too foggy. We took a pic of the foggy cloud just to say this is where it is SUPPOSED TO BE. The man was HONEST and said you can not see it most of the time. Then when you leave you have to drive down steep hills thru private residence with the brakes on. take a pic from far far away and do not waste your time trying to find something that is not even there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRAVELDEB_10
50,Must-see,"It IS iconic. It IS the city's symbol. That said, you don't need to get terribly close to take a great picture, and once you've done that, there really isn't anything to do. I'd recommend driving through the Hollywood Hills (stunning views) and making a stop off Canyon Lake Drive. There's parking space along the road and plenty of space along it to take a good picture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaR697

40,Great easy hike,"Begin the hike from Sunset Ranch, and hike up to the sign. Although you can't get close and personal to the sign, you get a great view of west LA and the san fernando valley on the other side. The hike is unshaded (and can get very hot in the summer) and although it is a short hike, bring some water and sunscreen.for more information, this is a great site to visit: http://hollywoodsigntrip.com/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleY886
40,It's a must.,"The iconic sign. What's not to love about the huge, beloved sign. I'm glad they repaired it from the ruins. Granted you can see it for miles, but it is impressive. I'd suggest, if you get closer to it, be mindful of the neighbors who live close. It's a must to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374dw
30,Great for a picture,"The sign you can see from anywhere and so there's no need to drive miles to see it. At the end of the day it's just a sign, albeit iconic. Park somewhere and take a picture and that's it. You can some better pictures if you buy a postcard. It's the symbol of the city and area so it's a must and you have to get a picture, and it's a free attraction but you don't need long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mr_MrsBeckett
40,Good for a quick picture,"You don't need to get terribly close to enjoy the sign - in actual fact it's best viewed from afar. I found a great little spot on Canyon Lake Drive (just past the park), where there's a convenient place off the road to park and pose for a picture! However, once you have your picture, there's little else to do here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wycombe-Simon
40,Got to see it,If you are visiting LA you have to get a picture of this. There is a park across from it were you can snap a shot. And it's free so how can you go wrong,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/712christineg
50,hollywoood,"i went on a tour that parked at the bottom of the sign and showed us how to do a cool camera trick where you look like you holding it! Was cool, you dont need to be super close its good to see it from there, many other cars were stoppped for pics and the view is cool. you can see madonnas old house if that interests you and the dam, a must see in hollywood",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilym1991
40,Don't worry about getting close to it. It doesn't matter!,"The sign is a must see in Hollywood, just to say you've seen it but getting up close and personal is not necessary. I read all sorts of reviews about how to get as close as possible but I wasn't going to waste a day of my trip getting to something that you can see from many places anyway. Simplest & easiest in my view is at the Hollywood and Highland shopping centre next to the Dolby Theatre. You can get some good photos with the sign in the background. It may look small on the pics but you can see it quite adequately. Just need to pick the right time of day to do it as, if you try it too early in the morning, the mist & haze doesn't lend itself to a good pic. I went late afternoon/early evening when it had lifted. Dont try and use your tripod in the centre to take a steady shot though. I did that and was given a visit by the security guards who told me that tripods were not allowed in the centre. I'm pretty sue she felt important after telling me off for such a terrible act.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidM096
40,Really pleasant walk and great views,Would recommend to go the walk up to the sign.... It's really pleasant and not too steep. Takes around 40minutes to reach the top and can get great photos. It's a free day out and well worth a look!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RL89
30,Mount Disappointment,"I lived in Hollywood for years. Every day I looked up to see the LETTERS. The sign is in a private residential area. It is not in a public space. The sign sits on very private property. It is not flood lit nights. There is no parking up there. And the streets in the Hollywood Hills north of Franklin Avenue are narrow, winding and lack parking. The sign is best seen from afar. Another reason why Hollywood is the most disappointing tourist destination extant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTW72
50,Had to see,It was actually exciting to actual see the sign in person its a ways up the hill but u can stop & zoom ur camara to take a pic. This is to funny my aunt stays in L.A. so she took me sight seeing traffic is very heavy but when we got to the area where the sign was i was like please stop so i can soak this in i always see this on tv but i can scream i made it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mz_Washington

40,You can get reasonably close,"Another one that we had to do on our Western USA road trip. Went to the observatory first for great panoramic views over Los Angeles, could see the sign in the disctance.Used the Garmin Sat nav on the Iphone, Put in the sign under attractions, or use Deronda Drive/Mount Lee drive. You can get reasonably close for some good pictures. It is driving through a lot of narrow and sharp corner lanes, but the area is very nice,almost unlike the rest of Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896JanK896

30,Go see,"If you're in LA you have to go and see this just because! To be honest, it's a little underwhelming. We walked from downtown hollywood all the way up and its quite a walk and fairly steep at times. You're walking through a residential neighbourhood and are met with 'Tourists Go Away' written on the ground which is actually pretty cool. You can't get close to the sign because its fenced off and we had cops tell us they'd fine us if we went nearer to it. But you should still go and get a photo of yourself with the sign behind you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarah_11e
30,underwhelming,Bit of an anti climax when I got here. You can't get too close to the sign and there is nothing else to doOn a positive the area is very clean and well maintained.If you turn your back to the sign you do get to experience an amazing view of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busterIreland

30,Can't Visit.,"You can't actually visit the sign. Security keeps you out, but you can see it from all over. Bring back a time when movies were really made in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Spectactular view,"I was so thrilled to actually get my picture taken with the Hollywood Sign in the background - the view from the hill is fantastic. Got lots of pictures. To qctuallybe there after seeing this sign on T.V. for years and ssaaying this is on my bucket list, I was very happy to have been there in person. Nice drive to get there past beautiful homes built on side of cliffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cmacdonald54
30,An icon!,Great iconic part of Hollywood. Can been seen and photographed from a long way away!! We didn't get up close but our tour guide in Hollywood told us the history of the sign and took us to a great viewing point next to the Dolby Theatre.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CourtneyandDoug
30,Tourist Stuuf,We could not get close enough for a decent photo. One of the viewing platforms was not accessible. Of course fun to just see. There is a better location but you need a car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SallyF204
30,History to see,Just have to see the sign if you are coming to Hollywood. It's part of history. I'm glad they keep it up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynthiaF57
50,A must do!,"We hiked up to the back of the Hollywood sign. There were steep hills and I wouldn't say an easy hike, our leg muscles were sore the next day. Wear comfortable shoes, sunscreen and bring water. There are no restrooms on the trail. Some of the trail is dirt with horse manure scattered around, the rest is paved. We typed in Franklin and Beechwood into our GPS. When you get to Beechwood go to the end of the road. some areas are residential but just keep going and you will end up at a parking lot right before you get to the ranch. You will see a sign that says Hollywood Sign. When you come to a split in the road be sure to ask someone which way to go. At one split left is to the front of the sign and right is to the back. We did the back first. It was cool being that close to the sign, you can't get that close to the front. There is fencing and security cameras that prevent you from getting closer than they allow. On the way back down the mountain we went around to the front. There is a big open area that is great for taking pictures. The views from the mountain are spectacular so make sure you go on a clear day. The sign seems so close at that point. The overall time we were there was about 3 hrs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorims
30,Cool,"I think the only reason why I was impressed by this sign was the fact that I've seen it so many times in movies so it's iconic. Other than that, it's just plain white sign. It doesn't even glow in dark... It' s really nothing special, at least to me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasnaM798
40,Take a nice hike up to the sign,"On our way to Universal Studios Hollywood, we decided to hike to the Hollywood sign. It took us about an hour to hike up there. The trail is very nice and wide, and it is not too strenuous. If you'd like to hike to the sign, find the intersection of Franklin and Beechwood on your GPS. From there, go north on Beechwood until you cannot go any further. You will come to a dirt parking lot which holds about 10 cars. If you want one of these spots, you must go early. Everyone else parks on the street, and traffic gets crazy! We arrived at that parking lot at 9am and were lucky to get a spot. The road was already lined with many cars. After hiking to the sign returning to our car, the foot traffic was noticeably increased and there were many more cars on the side of the road. I recommend that you do the hike, and I highly recommend you go early in the morning. Our only disappointment was arriving up behind the sign and realizing that we could not get more than 200 yards from the sign - high fences and warnings of arrest. Its not like the movies in which people hang around close to the letters :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penmintex
40,The view of the city and mountains are better than the sign.,"The great views at the tourist stop is better than seeing the sign is why I give it a 4. So, if it is on your tour list and you are like me not that excited about seeing the sign, you won't be so disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveL577
40,On a clear day,The entrance to the service road is reached through a residential neighborhood. Parking is scarce. We arrived at 8am on a Sunday and snagged the last spot.The hike up is relatively easy and about 4 miles round trip. There are no facilities (restroom or water) so be prepared. Lots of the friendly neighbors walk their dogs this early.The views are amazing. There was a marine layer the day we hiked and the vistas were beautiful. Know that the closest you can get to the sign is about 25 yards. You are behind a chain link fence.We took hot chocolate and cookies to enjoy at the top. Other hikers are very willing to take your group's picture--just reciprocate!Had brunch afterwards at Sunset and Vine! Good end to a fun morning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socforward
50,the best photo op for you and the hollywood sign....,"if you park in the shadow of the griffith park observatory and hike the trail about 1/2 mile, there's a perfect photo spot for a photo of you with the hollywood sign..........",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevepriceCBSnews
40,Icon of Hollywood,"I took a tour of the Hollywood sign, which was fairly short but interesting. It was nice to see it from an unobstructed view and hear all of the historical information about the famous sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dylan98
50,Don't use a tour company! Do it yourself!,"This is a great hike! On the way up where you park, you get to see some beautiful houses in the neighborhood right before the trail. Try and get there early or a bit later b/c parking is tight and tough to find. You might have a better chance if you wait a bit. The trail itself is fine as well. The only downside is all the horse poop on the lower part of the trail. You get close enough to the sign in the end (maybe a couple or few miles up?) and get some great views from several different spots along the way! Definitely a good hike for non-tourists and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleCA
40,Tourist attraction,"Don't let anyone tell you they will get you closer than any other tour. They all stop at the same spot. The sign is very far away but the view of LA and surrounding area is awesome. Worth the drive there, about 20 minutes from Hollywood blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dvyoral
40,don't miss the Hollywood sign,"i really enjoyed driving through the very narrow two way streets on our way to the hollywood sign.we didn't get lost; you pretty much keep driving until you can't drive any further, park and take pics or hike to the sign.there were plenty of people heading up the hill so you can always ask if you're lost especially since you might lose cell service along the way. i only saw one small sign that pointed us to the hollywood sign and i think that was by wonder view drive but we were still able to find our way.loved the views! it's not a mind blowing experience but it's an enjoyable scenic route to a 'large' part of hollywood history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstru
50,Easy Vantage Point - Hollywood Blvd,So its one of those things that you have to see when you are in LA. There is a simple and easy vantage point just behind Hollywood Blvd. The shopping plaza which is attached to the rear of Graumans Chinese Theatre has a triple walkway at the rear with a view of the Hollywood sign. Its not super close - but it is close enough to grab a picture without interruption.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellepas2808
40,Cool to See,"The over 30 foot letters are cool to see, but I like many would not make the long hike to get right up and personal with them. I saw them from a distance and I was satisfied enough with that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlelonek
50,Get as close as you can get!,"I really enjoy this hike, there is something special about being THAT close the the iconic sign that nothing else really compares too. I wrote a blog post detailing how to get as close up to the front of the sign as you can get, with out getting arrested of course :) Check it out! Happy hiking!http://mrandmrsadventure.com/2013/02/21/hiking-to-the-hollywood-sign/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandMrsAdventure
10,Buy a postcard,"This is an icon in Hollywood. However, it is in the hills, you cannpt walk up to it to take a photo. It's in a smal residential area of Hollywood. These streets are narrow, there is no place to park and you should respect the people who live in this neighborhood. Buy a postcrd, the photo will be better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryD879
50,Wonderful way to spend a morning!,"You don't have to be a visitor to LA to enjoy this hike. It's beautiful. There's actually a network of trails all through the hills. I know this because we took a wrong turn on the way back to the parking lot on North Beechwood and we ended up on the other side of the hill! Our one hour hike ended up taking 2 hours! Not to worry, though - it was a fun mistake. We got to see more of the hills and more views.You get pretty close to the sign. Makes for some fun photos!Make sure to arrive early. The parking lot will be full, but you'll be able to find something along the street close to the trailhead. The later you arrive, the further down the street you'll be parking...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pokee
50,Must see in L.A,Getting photos of the sign itself is easy but if you want a photo of yourself and the sign is a little hard! It is a must see when you are in Hollywood though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brookev303
50,A must do while visiting Los Angeles,"My family and i really enjoyed the walk up to the Hollywood sign.The scenery is excellent and its a nice break from the fast paced city.Theres plenty of parking spaces at the bottom of the trail and a number of areas to get a picture of the sign from as far or as near as you want to get to it.Theres a ranch called sunset ranch about 5 minutes up the trail where you can rent horses to ride around the dusty trails of the massive park (Griffith Park). The views are spectacular and get even more impressive the higher you go. Once you reach the top not only is there a sense of achievement of Mount Lee but you can see from down town LA on the right, to Santa Monica over on the left and the LA resevoir near left. You can also see the neighboring Griffith Observetory. We noticed a couple of eagles soaring around the canyons and the amount of smog lingering over the city. Behind the sign you can see Burbank and Forest Lawn Memorial park (where Michael Jackson is buried). The walk can take aslong as you want it to. I think it took us about 2/ 2 and a half hours overall but you could do it in less time. This was one of the highlights of my visit to LA and i would advise anyone to go and get as close as you can to this iconic attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRHalliday
50,Horse back riding at the Hollywood sign,"Okay so a bit cheesy...yes.. but had a blast!. I was born in Southern California and had never been to the Hollywood sign. We ended up riding the horses all the way to the Mexican restaurant...which seemed like a good idea at the time but TOO long of a ride..for sure. The guide was really good, the horses were ...well trail horses and behaved how they were supposed to. It rained (in the dark on the way back) but who cares. Views were great, it was different, fun and I would do it again (but only an hour or so next time) What a kick, it was a real treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814LucyM
30,Iconic,"Good to see if you have your own car it's quick and easy, but really not worth spending much time on!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnnieHolden
50,Great uphill journey.,"Get your walking shoes on, your in for a hike. There's easy to find directions online for the best parking and the easiest way to the main trail. Once on it, its about a two mile, thirty minute, up hill journey, so be paired. Bring plenty of water, there's no bathroom, so plan accordingly. Also first part of the route is shared with a horse trail, so watch out for poop.Once at top the views are incredible, the Griffin Observatory looks as small, as the Hollywood Sign does from the Observatory. Thats a cool sight. There's fences and cameras all around, so sadly you can't act out your favorite scene from Friends with Benefits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matthew0027
40,Cool to See Up Close,"We choose to drive up the road to get as close to the sign as possible. Coming in from one direction you will be twisting and turning through a neighborhood but that is where the best view is. We drove up close, took a few pictures and kept driving. It is definitely neat to see but doesn't really require much time and it can be seen from many other places in the city as well. My only thing was that we waited until night because we thought it would be lit, and it was not so you really couldn't see it that well, so this is something you will want to do during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristenH790
50,Iconic Imagery and a fun hike,"I have lived in Los Angeles nearly 20 years and only just hiked here in January of 2013! There are amazing views of the hollywood sign and exceptional photo ops as well. The hike is mildly strenuous. I consider it easy but your mileage may vary. Unless they're in really good shape, don't force this hike on Grandma and Grandpa. You can drive around and get some great views from the car. Here's some of what you can expect as a tourist and as a local. First, there are several ways to approach the sign. I will not provide instructions here but I will suggest you take precautions. First, parking in the Hollywood hills is at a premium. Be respectful of residents. Expect to park some distance from the trailhead. Be sure not to leave valuables in your car. Be sure you don't impede traffic. In some weather conditions, parking may not be possible due to the extreme terrain and fire danger. Fire trucks must be able to make it into these remote canyons. Do not take chances! Be prepared. It does get warm so bring plenty of water, maybe wear a hat, wear proper footwear and dress in layers. Bicycles are not allowed. There are NO RESTROOMS. Don't pollute the trail and surrounding areas with your lack of this knowledge. If this boyscout rant seems like common sense, wait until you will see none of the suggestions being followed by others you meet along the trail. Don't be those people. Once there, the hike is fairly easy, the trails are basically fire roads. The trails have steep sections but for people in decent health, should not pose problems. Wheelchairs and strollers will not find easy access. There are steep ravines along the sides. Children should be kept out of these areas. Stay on the trails. Yes, rattlesnakes live here. do not look for them. they may find you first! You may encounter horses. Be cautious. Most horses are acclimated to the area and to people but you do not want to be around them if they are spooked. If you have a dog, keep it leashed for everyones safety. Yes, even little Pookie. Small pets make great coyote snacks. Your snarling pit bull may spook a horse. Cell phones work extremely well here. Calling 911 is easy. Pulling a horse and rider from the side of mountain is not. You'll encounter all types of people on your hike. Most are tourists. Don't ask them for directions. Plan your hike and you'll know what to do if your plans go south. I can't stress this enough: take your trash with you! If you bring it up, be sure to bring it back to your car. If this write-up seems like a jaded jab at all the Hollywood hopefuls that populate this trail, it's only because I spend a lot of time pointing these same somewhat obvious points out to random hikers in other Southern California parks. Ultimately I want you to enjoy your visit and I want the people who come after you to enjoy their visit, too. When you're done, why not stop in at Roscoe's chicken and waffles on Gower Street. It close by, cheap and great fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Actual_User
40,It's the Hollywood Sign!,Out out-of-country friends consistently say it's the #1 image of the United States. And that blows me away because it's just a wooden sign erected to promote local real estate. But I guess it's special. Best to view going up Beachwood Canyon or Bronson. Just go to Paramount Pictures on Gower and head north.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/139EricB
40,A nice hike and great views.,"Come on, you know you want to see it up close :) It's a nice hike, a bit steep in parts but not technically difficult. You can't get close enough to touch it anymore, it's been fenced off for security reasons and it is monitored by cameras. Go during the week if you can, I had no problems with parking or crowds, only passed 4 or 5 people along the way. Really great views of the area. Great way to spend part of your afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/david717
40,go yourself,"We took a sight seeing trip which promised to take us close to the Hollywood sign but simply took us to an observation point overlooking the Hollywood bowl. so needless to say the photos are none existent. a few days later we had a car hired and put Hollywood sign into the sat nav, it took us to a junction in the road were there was a good view of the sign and lots of people seemed to be stopping and taking pics, however being irish we decided to keep going and came to the entrance of what i think was the sunset ranch (where people go for horse riding trips in the mountains), we followed everyone else up the dusty track and parked before the entrance to the ranch. there was a track up the hill which brought you up to a brilliant view of the sign with great photo opportunities for creating lovely memories of LA. Yes the sight seeing trip showed you where the stars live and you wouldnt find them yourself, but you are passing hundreds of houses and being told paris hilton lives here and eddie murphy lives there, when you get home you forget which house belonged to which star and it costs a lot of money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bdgtraveller
30,"Good view, but you only see the back of the sign",The only way to get there is up Beachwood dr.. Go all the way to the end. Weekend traffic is horrible and the streets are very narrow. You will probably have to turn around and find parking on beechwood since the parking at the end is probably good for 15 - 20 cars. The trail is wide and about 1.5 to 2 miles each way. You actually are above the back of the sign. The trail is a mix of hard packed dirt and other portions are old asphalt. I would HIGHLY recommend going during the week.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvillamil
40,Great place for photos,"My friend and I had difficulty figuring out exactly how to get to the sign, but we ended up on top of a hill after wandering around the residential area for a bit. Make sure to put on your emergency break! Overall, we had a lot of fun taking those silly pictures of us ""holding"" the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suz151
30,Inspiring and great for photos.,"We stayed at Loews Hotel (recommended) in the heart of Hollywood. This famous sign was so large, we could see the detail of the frame etc. We stayed here for a week and several times a day this sign was in our view either from the hotel, walking about or from the Hollywood Highland Center (a great Mall). The sign has a lot of significance in the history of Hollywood and could be one of the most photographed icons in the entire state of California, possible exception being the Golden Gate bridge. This sign along with its natural background offers great photography with the occasional bonus if cloud, shadow, mist etc is present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAugust
40,Hike your bones up to the #1 LA icon!,"The local residents don't really like us parking up here to take the hike. But do it anyway! Or better yet, have someone drop you off. The views and experience are worth it... and just think of your photo to show the folks back home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacannes
50,Impressive and iconic,Iconic and amazing. Must be seen whilst in LA. Best viewed from the balcony in the centre of the Chinese theatres.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgramguy
40,Long way to reach for a must see,"If you are a first timer, it is better to use navigator.Exact address for view point is: 3121 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, United StatesOn the way, you see many narrow and returning roads with good houses around.Parking your car on a ramp, you will come up with many people came for the same reason.10 minutes is more than enough if it is not very crowded and you can take pictures only you and Hollywood sign without anybody around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eyrice
50,Tick this one off the list!,This is a great way to see the sign.Go to the end of Mullholland Drive. Park the car and walk the short trail in the Hollywood Hills.You don't get real close but you get some great photos. No need to pay one of the tour operators.Also you'll get a brilliant view over the city and its free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geoffdemanser
30,Go to LA. See the Hollywood sign. Tick the box,"Despite what you might have seen in the movies, you can't get up close and personal with it, nor is it illuminated at night, so don't expect too much.That said, it's hard not to see the sign when you're in LA, and not too difficult to get reasonably close for that all-important photo. Definitely one of the must-do items on a trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdiC796
30,Bring your hiking boots,"Unless this is something that your really need to see, I would say skip this and pick something else. The views of the city are really nice, but its hard to get very close to the sign. Plus the hike is very step, no railings on some pretty good size drop offs and its slippery. I think the drive through the neighborhoods were more exciting then the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsosso
50,The famous sign,"Drove to mullholand drive to get an up close view if the famous Hollywood sign. It is best to go before noon to get better pictures. On the way you will see some beautiful , expensive homes of the rich and famous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalGirl84
40,Eye catching.,I could see the sign from various places around hollywood and up on the hills and in Griffith park. We decided to go for a walk to get as close as we could to it. I loved the wonderful views from there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshinemags
30,THe Famed Hollywood Sign,It looks eye catching but nothing spectacular about it. It is just famous because of what the word connotes and the back drop when it is loacted.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RosannaV228
30,Interesting,It was part of our LA tour. The weather was overcast that day so when we arrived to the lookout to see the Hollywood Sign we couldn't see much. Again it was disappointing that we only got 10 mins to see this famous site & it would have been a lot better if our tour guide actually came up with us to the lookout to show us from there where the movie stars homes were located. Instead she sat in the van & told us before we went ahead to look at a grey roof for some movie star's name that I could not even remember. Very disappointing that we payed a lot of money for this tour & they didn't take the time to come up with the whole group to tell us a bit more instead they left us to wonder who lives where !!! I would not take this tour again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulettea621
50,You can get very close to it,Check the web for travellers tips about coming REALLY close to the sign and finding the best spot for pictures. When we were there a guy that seemed to be jogging (and also to be a local) helped us with the photographs. Great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Claudio_Souza
50,Great views of the sign!,We found the Hollyridge trail and decided to hike part of it so we could get better views of the sign. It's off Beachwood Canyon Drive. There is no address for it so we found the closest place to it -- Sunset Horse Ranch and plugged that address in. You have to drive through neighborhoods to get there. It comes out of nowhere when you pull up. Park on the side of the road and start hiking. It's pretty hilly so make sure you are wearing the right shoes. We didn't hike the whole trail -- just to a stop where we had good views. It was excellent! Make sure you find this trail on your next trip to L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keg198
50,Come for the sign and stay for the hike!,"This place is a hikers paradise. Come when it's cool or you will regret it. Bring a picnic and enjoy the views of the hills. Miles of trails. If you come off of Beachwood Canyon Drive there is acute little store that sells sandwiches, wine, drinks and the like. You can purchase your supplies there and see another side of Hollywood as well as see how real people live!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariasolis1
50,What Can You Say About the Icon?,"You really can't get to it legally. Beachwood Canyon leads up toward it. At the bottom of Beachwood there's a house that was Busby Berkley's, by legend. All up and down the roads from there are sidewalks that lead up to higher roads. They are sidewalks without roads, for they go up the hillsides between homes through the early housing developments of the 1919+ era. Homes are fascinating editions of the early LA Hollywood era Mediterranean and Spanish houses with staircases of their own like short narratives. Standing at Franklin Avenue and looking up at it is a reasonable and easy alternative. If you haven't eaten yet, go to Musso and Franks and order a gin martini.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VeniVidiFrui

40,An Iconic Must-See,"Although getting to the Hollywood sign is a pain and not worth the effort, it's fun to see if you're a tourist. (I'm sure locals don't think anything of it.) There are many vantage points and picture-taking opportunities in the areas surrounding the sign. My family and I enjoyed the view from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsctraveler
30,Ok from far away...,"Drove up beechwood dr to parking area right before sunset ranch. We wales uphill about 200 yards to a nice viewing area but kids were disappointed we couldn't walk to the sign. It looks like you could walk to the sign, but may have been 2 or 3 miles each way and seemed steep and loose sand in some spaces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisaasselin
20,Whats the reason to see this?,We visited Hollywood and saw the Hollywood sign. However we had some expectation about how Hollywood would be and were very disappointed when we saw it.For me the sign is just as boring and unspectacular as Hollywood is. What is the reason to come here? Because you associate it with all the great movies produced here. However there you don't get the feeling of being somewhere special. It is just a street with a bit of tourist attractions and a sign far out in the hills. Not worth a visit.You can't even go to the sign!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loooooper
20,Hollywood Sign Pfftt!!!,"You can't drive up to the Hollywood sign. You have to park on a dirt road and take a 30 minute hike to get to it. Personally, I can't see the point. It's all fenced off with security cameras everywhere so you can't stand next to it for a photo and the view is no better than further down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimF859

40,Check it Out,The view from the Hollywood sign is one of those classic Hollywood views you have to see if you visit. It's really cool hiking around and if you can get up there taking pictures with the letters.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
30,Disappointing,Took the bus to Hollywood and instead of glamour and glitz found a very shabby street with a few gold stars in the pavement and a lot of very tacky shops selling tees and plastic fridge magnets. Got a photo of the Hollywood sign but this location needs to buck its ideas up and kick out the tired and tawdry.There are also way too many touts trying to sell tour tickets. Shame. It just seems to have lost its identity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jag500

50,Must see Landmark,"This to me is what L.A. Is all about, and what this city has been built around. I took a tour which drove though Beverly Hills where we saw famous Hollywood stars homes, and we ended up as near as you can get to the Hollywood sign, do not ever thing as I did, that you would stand along side this iconic image, you do not. You will however get some great shots with your camera from a vantage point, make sure you take bottled water if you are on an open topped bus, you will need it. Enjoy you may even get a see a star or two on your tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657SusanC

50,a must-see in L.A.,"The Hollywood sign is really a must-see when visiting L.A. Nothing reminds you that you're in the heart of the film and entertainment industry more than the Hollywood sign. This was my first time in L.A., so I definitely wanted to see it.We didn't hike, but rather drove through the hills until we got as close as possible. This is not recommended for out-of-towners - we were only able to do this because we were visiting friends who live in L.A. and have made the drive many times before (THEY drove - not us!). The drive requires going up very many twisting, super-steep hills that are very narrow and strictly residential. Not a drive for the faint of heart. The views of the city and the valley are incredible, though.Once we got to a close vantage point, we pulled over and took pictures. In the end, the sign was hard to get to, but I thought it was worth seeing as close as possible. The drive (despite being scary) was also very scenic and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dobostorte6
40,"Great Hiking, great views",Great hikes in the area. Follow with a healthy lunch at Gratitude Cafe on Larchmont Ave. Wonderful way to spend a weekend afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiml695

40,Just had to see it!,"While looking around Hollywood went to the fourth level of the Hollywood and Highland mall, which was a nice mall and got good views of the sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieHamilton
40,Iconic!!,"You can't really take a visit to Hollywood without seeing the iconic symbol of the city! The cool thing is that you can really see it from may places, and there are several opportunities to get good photos. Probably the coolest was just driving around town and looking up and seeing it from the car window...very neat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VolsFanForever
40,A typical tourist must see,"Our friend drove us to see the Hollywood sign before heading off to the zoo. We were able to take some good photos, but it was a shame that we could not get closer. A definite 'must see' for all tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisgamery
40,classic LA view,Seeing and visiting the Hollywood sign is a classic LA visitors activity. It's just a fun thing to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kknew
40,Iconic LA,"What's not to love about the Hollywood sign? A landmark, easy to spot from many points in LA... My son drove up near it, then hiked up a steep incline for 20 minutes and reached it; the view from there, he said, was spectacular. But just looking up at it just brings me a smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mcgreek
40,One of the few thing that draws people to LA,"While not a specific destination or anything to do, it is one of the great landmarks of the world, and is one of only a few things that makes LA a destination. It is emblazoned high on the Hollywood hills and very few visitors would leave without a photo of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6
40,Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign,Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign are part of our our for out of town guests. Everyone wants to see where the Stars live and of course the Hollywood sign. You can't walk up to the sign any more but there are several areas for good pictures and views of the Los Angeles area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kukui_Aloha
50,Guess where?,it was cool to see this famous sign up close. the views are awesome. the drive was interesting - lot of twists and turns - but it was worth. i would do it again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaW122
50,Excellent!,"Loved seeing it ""live"". Hard to get to (and I didn't even try to) but you can get nice pictures of it from the Griffith Observatory. But it is spectacular and it feels a bit unrealistic seeing it ""in person"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NataliaC697
40,Don't get lost!,"On a recent trip to LA, my friends and I did the climb to the Hollywood sign...amazing views. Great exercise, especially if you take the wrong turn and add time walking back to where you need to go to make it to the sign. On the trek uphill you get to a point where there is a no trespassing sign in orange/red and that's your turn to make it to the Hollywood sign and then stay to your right till you make it to the top. Wear comfortable shoes and take plenty of water, especially if it's hot! And don't forget your camera...that's the whole point, right? Overall worth every painful muscle the next day after seeing the sign! Good luck...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_colts2009
50,Picture Perfect Hollywood Sign,"Ok before I begin, I'm sure you want to know how to get to the Hollywood Sign. Since the sign doesnt really have a physical address, the address shown below will take you up the Hollywood mountain to get some excellent close up pictures.3204 Canyon Lake DriveLos Angeles, CA 90068Put that in your GPS and it will take you to the best picture spot. See my pictures. The Hollywood sign is a piece of history known around the world. I took my family there for some pictures . We left early morning on a Saturday to beat the crowds and drove up the mountain through some small streets barely enough for two cars, but still drivable. There is nothing else to see around on the mountain since it is a residential area. There is no food available at this spot, so carry some snacks with you. You can get to the spot for free, there is no fee to park (at least on the weekends). But the picture spot does get crowded later on in the day, so get there early if you want to take some pics. Tour buses start coming to this spot later on in the day and you will see tour helicopters flying over as well. See my pictures.If you want to touch the Hollywood sign, i've got some bad news, you cant (legally). To get to the sign itself is a long hike on a trailless mountain and then when you get up to the sign it is guarded by a fence and monitored by cameras.I think this sign is a piece of history and anyone visiting LA should take some pictures with the sign.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AeronauticalEngineer
50,Get as close as you can to the famous sign!,"I spent a few hours dragging my children up to this sign one day when we didn't have much planned. I will say one thing, they will NEVER forget it! Ha It was close to 90 degrees and it takes roughly an hour (or more if you have one who hates any form of anything physical) to get as close as you can without getting arrested. I LOVED it. Ever since I was a child I wanted to get as close as I could......well I did. :D Not much to the trail really, it's an easy walk up a slow incline. You can see Los Angeles from various angles....okay. I think if you're wanting something to remember.....it's worth the effort. I'm glad I forced my family to do this...ha Go early, parking is very limited at the beginning of the trail. And if you have anything bigger than a compact car.....good luck to you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kubla76
50,Worth the drive,"Winding drive through residential streets will take you to a great vantage point if you are patient with the drive. Use caution going up, as the streets are narrow and the streets are not one-way streets. Memorable experience, would recommend the drive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickenbiscuit
20,Just Ok,"Is a bit of a pain to get to a decent place to view the sign (we went to Mullhullond Drive)...traffic, etc. The sign itself is a landmark but really not all that special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38MichaelP
30,Iconic but not much to see here...,You can see this sign from all over Hollywood but you can't get overly close unless you are prepared to drive through residential areas. We viewed it from Griffith Observatory. Best bet is to bring a zoom lens!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkM607

50,Fun,The Hollywood sing is very fun to look at and the letters are huge and you can make the picture look as if your holding the hollywood sing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarrisonG934
50,WHAT A THRILL!,"What a thrill to see this sign!!! This is possibly (one of) the most famous signs in the world, and it did not disappoint.Although you can get lots of glimpses and views of the sign from all over Hollywood, we were on an organised coach tour and were taken to a really good vantage point to get a good photo. It was at the Hollywood and Highland Complex (I think that was the name of it) - the shopping centre next to the Dolby (formerly Kodak) Theatre. There is an area inside which is great for viewing the sign although you do need a zoom really, to get a decent photo. But much easier than trying to find your own way up into the hills to find it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DONNYLOVER
50,The famous sign,"It is neat to see the sign. It is neat to be in Hollywood. All the sites are great and the feel of all the stars being there, even though you don't see them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilhelmineM
30,Any view of this is great!,You don't need to drive through the windy roads risking getting lost or accidentally turning down someones driveway to see the sign. Just find a nice spot somewhere in Hollywood which offers a view and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanelleT60
50,Bucket List: Tick,Easily found the road through the residential estate up to the Hollywood shrine. There is very limited parking and from reading the signs there are strict rules in place! Definitely had the wow factor!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J902LUandyh
40,Crazy,"It is very hard to find a spot to take a picture with the sign. He found a spot on Mulholland drive up the mountain; which actually had stairs to walk up on and an area with a telescope and information. All the tour buses went here. There is a tiny parking lot and you can also park along the road.We drove around for an hour before we found Mulholland, trying to find a spot on the street to take a picture, but there was no place to park. On some streets people were running out of their cars and into the road to try get a good shot. We almost gave up because it seemed difficult to get one good picture.I also hiked up Runyon Canyon and found a spot on top of a hill/mountain and I could see the sign from far away as well as the other spot near Mulholland Dr.The sign can be seen also near the Dolby theater on the bridges in the shopping center of Highland and Hollywood.All these locations see the sign from far away. I once got closer to it when I went before, but that was because a native knew how to drive us up through the houses to see it closely. SO there is a way to get closer and to see some fun houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraS670
50,free if u drive yourself!,"great location, views of the city and it is so near, do not miss it. lots of tourist there and it is a windy road up so take your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/macire
50,When in Hollywood you must see the sign.,I even took a hike to try to get as close as allowed. It is just a sign but when in Hollywood you must see it! It wouldn't be Hollywood without it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT
30,not a real good view,"I was a little let down by the sign, it was really a distance away& I thought it would be a little more to it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levyg
30,Not much to see here.,"As a first time visitor to LA, it was on our must do list. You can see the sign from a number of locations in LA. Search the internet for recommendations. We drove as close to it as possible. You end up in the hills. Hot and dry. Note that you cannot get up close to the sign.The sign itself is nothing special - it's not carved out of marble or anything like that. It's just iconic, and you have to have your photo taken with it in the background.So sort of recommended. Have a few photos, cross it off your list as done, and move on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dadofnog
40,Hollywood History!,"It was great to see! Its one of those things that you can say I was there! We drove into LA and managed to find our way pretty close to the sign. We didn‚Äôt get out of the car ‚Äì however after reading a lot more reviews, we would have probably tried the parking and gone for a walk! It was definitely something you need to see why you are here! Its Hollywood History!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nagh84
20,Really not much to it,"Yes it is famous and yes it is a landmark, but besides that there is really not to much to it. Though a picture of it can be nice for a photo album or the like, you don't need more than a couple of minutes to get the full grasp of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tessad791
50,really cool...,"You can view the sign driving throughout Hollywood and LA. However, if you choose to, you can drive pretty much all the way up but not close enough to touch! It is pretty exciting to see. You drive through a residental area and park up at the top for free. Very short hike up onto some rocks and then have your camera ready!! You can pose upon one rock and put your hand out as though you are holding ""hollywood"" right in your hand. Quick trip is all you need for the pictures only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidisb
40,good to see,If you can while in hollywood do try to find the hollywood sign. The area to get to the sign is residecial area but not hard to find. This sign has been feature in many hollywood movies.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lalocadr19
50,How to Get Close to the Sign,From downtown L.A. take 101 freeway to exit 8c and make your 1st right on N Beachwood Dr. Go North a about 1.3 miles and turn left on Ledgewood Dr. Go about .5 mile and turn left on Heather Dr. Take 2nd right on Durand Dr. and follow to the end. Take a right turn on Mulholland Hwy and follow till the road about .5 mile to the end. Very windy most of the way but it's worth it. This is as close as you can get by car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salp30
40,cant get near it,"it,s very high up on a massive hill and you cant get a close up photo unless you have a very good camera,i took my photos from the hollywood forever cemetery,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sattnin
30,Opportuinity lost?,"It seems odd that one of the most famous signs in the world is so distant. Griffiths Park offers the best photo opportunity but it is such a long way from it, it can disappear in group photos. Would it be so hard to design a place so you can go much closer?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
50,Still amazing after all these years!,"History! History! History! The Hollywood sign is dripping with it! Hike up to it or go to Griffith Park and gawk at it....whatever...just don't miss it. If you do, we'll take away your TOURIST PASS!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/preciouspinkxxx
20,Beware of the park police!!!,"When visiting this iconic sign, make certain you read ALL the small signs posted. While there, I witnessed the LA park police issue a ticket to a poor tourist, who inadvertently lit up a cigarette.The officer was very stern, uncaring, and unsympathetic to the tourist. Be Careful...Don't let these ""robots"" ruin your trip!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andiamo24

40,Walking up to the Hollywood sign,"It's difficult to get a close-up shot of the front of the Hollywood sign, but it's actually surprisingly easy to hike up to the back of the sign. This way, you can get within 100 feet of the letters. The view from the back isn't too great, since there's a fence separating you from the sign, but it's still really neat.There's a road leading up to the Hollywood Sign, but it's closed to vehicles, so you have to walk up it instead. Leave from your car at the northern end of North Beachwood Drive (extremely limited street parking). Walk for about 10 minutes, and then make a left at Mullholland Highway. The ""highway"" is really just an unlabeled dirt trail, so be sure careful not to miss it! Then walk for another 10 minutes or so, until you reach Mt. Lee Drive (a paved road). Make a right. From there, it's about a 30 minute walk up to the Sign. The whole walk is about an hour one-way.If you get mixed up with the roads (there are no signs), Google Maps is your friend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CorryWang
30,Fun to See Once,"Parking is a little crowded. You may have to walk a bit depending on how many people are there at once. Once you get there, it's a very short hike up to a spot where you can see the sign and take pictures. It was fun to see and say, yep been there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjdavids649
30,Hard to see,was a bit underated really. The sign is hard to see and you can't get up too close to it to really get a great picture of it. There's a temple you can go to and see a better view but I could never get up that way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LTtracy
50,Hollywood History,"This is a no-brainer.Formerly a sign that said Hollywoodland(in the ""old"" hollywood hey-day). See from regular walks in Griffith Park. Sometimes even walk from Greek Theater almost to this sign. Is this some super attraction, maybe yes-maybe no--but WTH-if you are anywhere in Hollywood you can normally see it(provided the day isn't too smoggy). WTH, if you want to knock off a few pounds-make the walk from the (Greek to the sign)---LOL",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrWalter
10,Waste of Time--Don't Go From Barham,"Boring experience and waste of time. Anyway, take Beachwood Canyon ONLY; Avoid Barham/Lake Hollywwod. Don't let your nav take you up Barham to Lake Hollywood Drive to get to the sign--you will be led around a reservoir with an ugly fence into a 60s/70s community and will miss the splendor of HOLLYWOODLAND. TAKE THE TIME TO GO UP BEACHWOOD CANYON (from Franklin Ave, or the Gower Exit off the 101 N.) in Hollywood, You will get a true flavor of the 20s steets and Spanish homes, and the closest views of the sign. My drive around the chain link fence gets one star.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LukeJ927
50,You have to see it once.,Monday is the day to tour Hollywood. There is plenty of parking and no crowds. The google map took us up a very windy/twisty route. Take the straight roads on the map.

ITS FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinalovestravel
50,Must do as a picnic,"We went there in our car following directios from tripadvisor map. It was so fun but do it our way. We first spent some time at walk of fame. ( it was not our first time there so we didn't stay there for long), then we stopped at Popy's on Hollywood Blvd very close to Vine St. We made our order to go and drove up to the Hollywood sign. It took us about 15 mnts. We planned it to be there one hour before sun set. We took pictures and sat down for our small picnic on some rocks overlooking beautiful scene of LA. My husband was so excited to do this picnic the Scinfield way if you have ever watched that episold. Then more pictures with the food and we bought icescream from an icescream truck that happened to be there.After sunset, official closing time, we took the Mullholand Dr fo a night scenic drive over looking the down town lights of LA.

30,Beautiful but Disappointing,"I searched and searched online and with GPS but the closest I was able to get to the sign was a small neighborhood below the sign, just past a reservoir.

10,Don't USE BARHAM/Lake Hollywood Dr.; Take Beachwood Canyon,"If coming from the 101N, exit at Gower St. and take Beachwood Dr. N. From the 101S, exit Argyle to frankilin to Beachwood Dr.You will see the real ""Hollywoodland"" and neat older homes, the Beachwood Cafe, the BEachwood Market, a quaint gift shop, with head-on views of the sign all the way up.It is worth avoiding coming from Barham to Lake Hollwood Drive--the ""back way"" to the sign. This way you see nothing but the sign. In fact, you end up in a 60s community which isn't even part of the original Hollywoodland.So FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET TO FRANKLIN AVE AND BEACHWOOD CANYON AND GO UP THAT WAY!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LesterK_12

I mean the very end. The road narrows and you think you have to park but if you continue on, the road becomes one lane, keep going and you will find parking..there is a riding stable ahead but the parking is for the sign hike. Once you begin the hike, you will be on a wide dirt path past the stables and up a few turns. When you come to the paved road, turn up the hill right. Keep on this road to the summit and you will be rewarded with panorama views of the Hollywood Hills mansions, LA and beyond. At one point up the road you actually look down to the San Fernando Valley on one side of the road and LA on the other. You will be looking down on Forest Lawn and Burbank, then LA.

It's a symbol of Hollywood. And it made me so excited to be able to see it this visit. There's just something about the sign that made me giddy first time I saw it. And every time afterward my visit there I still enjoyed viewing it. I'm sure it all means something slightly different for each person, but ultimately, it means for everyone that you're in Hollywood. It doesn't really feel like you're there until you can see it. I guess it's confirmation you are where the signs say you are.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MukuSix

We flew into LA, and at first, you think your in just any old city, you don't really realize you're in Hollywood. So as the bus drove up the hill, I got a glimpse of the sign between some trees, and felt, 'wow I'm really here'. It was just a cool sensation to feel like your in the movie capital. Where celebrites rise and fall. Where some of the best movie actors come from. They spend thousands and thousands of dollars to preserve this sign for a reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelcosmolady
40,Everyone Knows The Hollywood Sign,"In the last 10 years I have come to realize that The Hollywood Sign is perhaps the most famous landmark of Los Angeles recognized throughout the world. I once remember being asked by an individual in a reservation call center located in India, ""How far to you live from the Hollywood Sign."" The Hollywood Sign has been there as long as I can remember and I'm in my late 60s. It is located in Griffith Park and now, every year on January 1st, I along with about 20-40 other runners run from The Pony Ride in Griffith Park to the Hollywood Sign and back (we actually look down on the Sign), a distance covering about 14 miles (7 up and 7 down).There are several vantage points to get a picture of The Sign. While you cannot drive a car to the base of the sign, you can get relatively close by driving from Barham to a small park about 1 mile from the sign. Another vantage point is an elevated walkway that's part of the Kodak Theater (between the Kodak Theater and the Grauman Chinese Theater).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgmeigs
30,A bit disappointed,"Can only be seen from certain view points, it was misty, pictures were crappy. It is just a sign, nothing special. Wouldn't go back to see it on a clear day. been there, done that now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malc-66
40,Touristy,"It's nice‚Ä¶..touristy...it's just a sign...nothing spectacular‚Ä¶. Just overhyped. But then...I guess one must see it if they come to LA right? What I like about it, is that the surrounding and the view from the spot you go up the mountains to see it is great, not so much the sign itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/questionsc
50,Hike it!,Take a hike up behind the sign. You can see all of L.A. on one side and the valley on the other. Its beautiful and it takes you right behind the letters. If you are on Franklin and turn down Canyon and follow it back to a park you can follow that path up. I even took my kids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/farmer0406
30,"Nothing special about it, but now we have seen it :-)",Now we have seen the sign you always see in movies :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentp
40,Really hard to drive to,GPS took us to this dead end road that is the closest you can get. You can take a short trail that is a good view and picture. It is a really weird drive through the hills above LA. Lots of hair-pin turns and narrow roads. It was only like 15 minutes drive from Hollywood Blvd. and totally worth the time. The sign looks tiny from Hollywood Blvd and getting closer was cool. There is a little dog park that has more room and lots of poeple take picture from. Good views of LA also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChicagoFamily2010
50,Iconic Image,"We stayed in a room at the Reniassance that faced the sign. What a view!I knew there was no lights on the sign, but I did think there were flood lights, though. It would be cool to go up to the sign but it is not accessible by the public.Tip: If you go to Google Streets, you will find that Mulholland Hwy dead ends into one of the closet viewing spots. I do not think you can park there, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnrobertlucas
50,Awesome View!,"The route up to the Hollywood sign is a little rough & curvy, but boy once you reach the car pull-in area, the view of the city is amazing - I can only imagine what a night view would look like! There were many visitors when we arrived & a few tour buses, but you have to see the view in person to be able to fully appreciate it. I'd like to visit at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quietgirl7

50,Don't just look at it -- hike to it.,"From afar, the Hollywood Sign is just a symbol of failed hopes and dreams, but if you get up close it's breathtaking. Hiking up here only takes like an hour and a half, and then you get this Lion King-esque panorama of LA. It's easy enough to do with kids. Take some water, though. A fun way to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596aarong

50,Picture Perfect!,"If you're travelling by car, the best place to get a picture of the sign is from North Franklin Drive. There are plenty of places you can park, stop and take pics. You don't feel like you're in LA or Hollywood until you get to see the sign so you have to do this!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTheWorld84
40,Enjoy the trip,I enjoyed the trip through the neighborhood and around the lake getting to/from the Hollywood sign. We drove our rental car and were able to see how some of the real residents live.

30,Far Away!,"I did think we would get nearer to it on a sight Seeing tour but actually we only had a glimse of it.

30,It all depends on the tour you take,Hollywood is seedy. It is also a super fun place to visit during the day and to do the touristy things around Hollywood. Take a Beverly Hills full day tour. You will see the sign and the best areas. Be sure to also sign up for tickets to see a show taping. Give yourself 4 hours and be sure to tape it at home. It is a great memory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MLMRocksTravel

30,The Sign,"It is really thrilling when your younger and you get to see the sign. At least it was for me. I saw it when I was 18, but there is just a quick there it is ooh ahh and that's about it. I'm glad I saw it and there is so much more to do near Hollywood I would still recommend going but I wouldn't stay in Hollywood or make the trip just to see the sign. Make time to go to Universal Studios, Disneyland, and San Diego.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunflowerWallaWalla

It's a nice, familiar background to the Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hppiefrk
40,Fun,Just something fun to visit when in California. Interesting history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockynRobyn
50,A quick drive up Beachwood Canyon,It worth driving up Beachwood Canyon to see the Hollywood sign. There are several places to take pictures. While you are up there you can make your way down the other side to Lake Hollywood which is a great place to walk. There is a path around the lake which is a little over 3 miles. You will walk over the Hollywood Dam which was featured in the movie Earthquake.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musclegirl68

40,An American Icon,I know it's not historical or part of our founding fathers but this is truly an icon that is embedded in the American culture. We did not actually climb up/down to the sign but spent almost the whole time we were in LA trying to get that magical picture of it in the background of our family photos.

If you type in the address 3000 Canyon Lake Drive, Hollywood, or 3200 Canyon Lake Drive, it will bring you up into the Hollywood Hills to a wide spot in the road where you can pull over and take pictures of the sign, or if you walk to the other side of the road, great views of Hollywood and out of the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ostrowskicp

Along the way you'll get different views of the sign (it changes based on the angle) as well as stunning views of the city below (and Griffith Observatory, across the next peaks).

We had a great time taking fun pictures and just looking out at the city.The walk was a little more difficult than imagined. It was about an hour up and an hour down. It was a pretty steep climb.

30,Historical Los Angeles Landmark is a must see,"This is a Los Angeles must see, but if you're in Hollywood you can pretty much see it. Hard to find a place to stop and take pics. Best view is from 101 fwy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaK875
40,As close as you can get,"The actual sign is fenced in, making it difficult to get very close, but I nonetheless recommend the hike on Mount Lee that approaches the sign. Especially for visitors and newly-minted Angelenos, it's nice to see this icon as closely as you possibly can. From Mount Lee, there is a good view of the surrounding area. The hike is fairly exposed and dusty, so be prepared and try to avoid mid-day if it's going to very hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adamw350
40,Hike and See the Sign,"Since we had an out of town guest who enjoys hiking, what better way to show them a piece of LA history then going on the Hollyridge Trail Hike to the Hollywood Sign? And even though I grew up in LA, I've never been up to the Hollywood sign. Two birds with one stone!If it's your first time hiking this (like me), be sure to check out this website:http://hollywoodsigntrip.com/hollywood-sign-directions.shtmlIt's extremely useful. Although more people show up as the day goes by, you can't count on just following one of them in hopes that they will take you to the Hollywood sign, since the trail leads to different destinations. (Not to mention, a good majority of the people on the trail are tourist themselves, so....)Definitely get there early. Minimum parking space if you decide to park at the Hollyridge Trail small lot. And watch where you step! There are horse poo everywhere for the first part of the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cuetxpie
40,A photo must...,"If it's your first visit to Hollywood, you need a photo of the sign. Not much exciting otherwise, a quick photo op. An easy GPS address is 3200 Canyon Lake Drive.

30,Not like in the movies,"In our minds' eye, we would drive up to just behind the sign, and stand on the edge of the road looking down over the towering letters poised over the city of L.A layed out below. In reality, you drive through a maze of suburban streets looking for a reasonable glimpse, then stand and look at the sign from maybe half a mile away. There's a fairly strenuous walk up to a path that leads behind the sign, but we didn't do it.Is it worth the effort? Yeah, if you've got a car, a GPS and the time. It's iconic, without doubt. And a definite box-ticker. But it probably under-delivers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waimate01
50,It's the icon!,"You can't go right up to it, and navigating the hillside streets to try to find it will be frustrating - don't bother.

Its a hike to the sign, and you cant get right up to it, but fun anyways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amandalaurenwilt
50,Iconic sign...worth a visit,"I have to admit, I've been here many times. I know...it's the same each time I go but it's such an iconic sign and every time someone visited me, I'd take them there and it would always a great part of their holiday.There are 2 places for a great view:1.from Lake Hollywood view point as the lake is in front of you with views over LA and behind you is a great, clear view of the sign.2. Drive to the Sunset Ranch (3400 North Beachwood DriveHollywood, CA 90068) and park just before the entrance. You'll see signs to the sign which is a semi-steep canyon climb for 5mins (not for the elderly or injured) and you'll see the Hollywood sign very close up.I did used to go somewhere else to view it closer, but this is now closed off with a sign saying 'Trespassers will be Persecuted'!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnglishGirl-AngelM
40,It's a SIGN,"... A very famous sign, at that! You cannot actually walk right up to it, (like you've seen in the movies). Some people have tried, but were chase away by security. Anyway, the best views are from Beachwood Canyon, and if you can make your way up the hill to Mullholland, (no easy feat), you can almost snuggle right up with the sign, while getting breathtaking views of L.A. and the Lake Hollywood. You will also see the Bugsy Siegael/Madonna house (note: BIG WALL). Most importantly, you will get that prized photo for your mantel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockieK

50,Good Hike,"Everyone wants to see ""THE SIGN"", not many realize that ""seeing the sign"" is pretty much available only from afar. Besides that it's a great hiking area for those who prefer an active way of spending time.The drive up to the Griffith Park is wonderful ‚Äì very pretty. The place is gorgeous - great hills, nice paths. To get there you have to get to Griffith Observatory (which is pretty neat for those who like ""scientific"" stuff). The parking is free. There are a lot of tourists at the parking and the entrance area but they thin out by the time you walk up the first hill towards Mt. Lee. Then you'll see a lot of locals who I've noticed run a lot which to me is a good sign.If you are up for a hike make sure to wear layers and good walking/hiking shoes. Bring water and snacks. I'd stay on the paths even though some people venture off and go down the slopes and go through the brush. There are signs posted ""BEWARE: Rattle Snakes"" which can be scary but just don't be stupid. There are picnic tables and rest areas on the ""summits"" of the hills and they offer great views of LA and surrounding areas.You will NOT get to the Hollywood sign but you will have PLENTY of opportunities to take great photos. We were there before noon so the morning fog was still over the city but nonetheless - the views were great.The Griffith Park has many other things to do and see (a Zoo & an Observatory) but we did not have a chance to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anastasia08
40,Not as exciting as I thought,"the only reason I was there was because I had to do an astronomy project so I went to the Griffith observatory. It was nice to see it, but maybe it was just me, but it wasn't even that huge. It looked nice and it's such a historic place that it made me feel special to be there, but it was okay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katsterg
30,A must see,"You must check it out when in Hollywood. However, you can't actually get too close to it. So that's a bummer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
50,"Awesome experience, and free too!!","Few good things in life are free. Hollywood sign is one of them. Hike is not very challenging. There is not much along the path but reaching the sign is worth it. The view is gorgeous and you can see and capture pictures of Los Angeles Downtown and Hollywood. Hiking is 7 miles long and physical work, so I recommend doing it in winter and packing enough water and snacks. Make sure you start early and it is not dark when you reach the sign otherwise you wont be able to enjoy the view completely. Its a must see and a must do in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seharmd
40,So iconic!,Such a major part of living in LA. I have always heard the hike to it is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samwabs

50,It's huge!,"This was a fun experience. Driving through the Hollywood hills is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. We got up close to the sign on a road we really were not supposed to be on (oops!), and got an idea of how absolutely ginormous the sign is. I wish we could've gone up to the actual sign, but it was forbidden. The view from the main sign lookout spot is beautiful as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagNEATO

40,Good but a bit far away,"This was a must see being in LA and we took a city tour. We stopped near the Walk of Fame and were shown where to get the best view from a shopping mall.

50,H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D enough said...,A sometimes hard to find gem in the sky. Most locals aren't very helpful in giving directions to the sign. You can take Beachwood Drive North all the way until it dead ends to Sunset Ranch for a great photo opportunity. Very cliche tourist spot but a must see on your vacation and travels.Cost: free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wrldtraveler365
30,A must see in LA,"The Hollywood sign is Iconic and a must see when in Los Angeles.

50,An icon...,"Like many tourists to Hollywood, we wanted a photo with the Hollywood sign as seen in so many movies and TV shows.We had many opportunities, but the best location we found was Griffith Park near the Observatory car park. Other good locations are from the 3rd floor at the Hollywood & Highland Centre and from Mulhulland Drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/james_is_now

40,HOLLYWOOD,"Took a trip around 'Hollywood Stars Homes' - we enjoyed it, dont know if all is to be believed, they could be anyones houses really. Still, its nice to see how the other half live and it was good value for money. Set aside 4 hours for this one.This is our 4th trip and I have to say, because of the unusually 'High Winds' that LA experienced in early December, we actually got excellent views over LA, The Hollywood sign and surrounding Hills instead of 'Smog' which on previous trips ruined the view.I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Set aside a good 4 hours for this trip, but its worth doing.So t",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coops51
30,Overall is good,"A good experience if you have time to in town, got to go see it. Just need to drive up the hill and see won't take a long time.

50,Highlight,I have waited for a long to time to see the sign and it didn't dissapoint. The first time we went it was too foggy to see but the next day I could see it and loved it. It was a dream come true for me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Efsta
30,Go to the Observatory for great view.,Wish that it would have lit up at night since we didn't arrive at the observatory until dusk. My 8 year old was SO excited to see it but then the sun set and we couldn't tell where it was.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myopinionz
50,See it from the above!,"I've lived in LA and have seen the sign many times, but last month I visited LA and a friend took us on his helicopter for a flight over the city - what a treat!!!Seeing the city (and the Hollywood Sign) from above is totally worth the investment!!! Well, we didn't really pay for it, but if you don't have a friend that owns a helicopter - rent one!!!It was a great experience!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel2andFr0m

40,From a distance,Just how it looks in the movies. You can see it from the Hollywood area. It was pretty cool to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldbeast
40,Attracts Like A Magnet,"Despite having a view of the sign from the bedroom window of our hotel, we just had to get a bit closer. Drove up as far as permitted in about 10-15 minutes from Hollywood Boulevard and parked in the limited and make-shift car park from where we were able to ascend the hill (by dirt track) for a short way in a few minutes. Really that's as close as you need to get to grab some good photographs - but watch out for Rattlesnakes (as the sign warns) although you are likely to be pretty safe if you stick to the dirt track. Don't know why but its just one of those ""I've been there feelings""....bit like Neil Armstrong when he landed on the moon in 1969 I guess!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FairCityFrasie
40,HOLLYWOOD,What's a visit to Hollywood without seeing the HOLLYWOOD sign. I was delighted that my first sight on my first day when I got off the bus at the Kodak Center was the HOLLYWOOD sign. It was such a nice way to start my trip to Hollywood. I also was able to see the sign from the Hollywood Overlook on Multiview Drive (Muholland Drive). The only thing that was disappointing is that the sign is not lit at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30

40,Excellent for tourists,"We had relatives from Brooklyn, NY; even though some did not speak much English, they all know about the Hollywood sign, having seen it in movies and TV. All wanted to see it while they were out in Hollywood and the Walk of Fame. We drove up to get a closeup of it and of course, took the usual tourist photos of them with the sign behind them. It's not too difficult, and for tourists, it is fun for them to be seen with the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dragon789wv
20,May be a dissapointment,I grew up here and as a kid I could even hike around the sign. You can not do that today. It is all private residence nearby and they hate the tourists who park all over or try to. It is too bad we don't have an official viewing spot but they are working on that. For now you can get a good view from several approved locations. Check this link....http://www.hollywoodsign.org/247.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49

Two days later, we drove along Mulholland Dr. I believe this is a much better vantage point to see the Hollywood sign from. I prefer the direction you can see it from.

It must have been a pretty decent spot because there were lots of other tourists there too.We had to stand in the middle of the road to get the best pictures so beware of traffic! Nearly getting hit by a car was not the highlight of my trip!The sign is what everyone thinks of when you say Hollywood and it was high on my agenda of things to see and I wasn't disappointed.

40,Worth a look,"As a free attraction, the sign is worth a look. It's easy enough to drive to, but then the rest is on foot, so give yourself plenty of time ( and daylight) to get there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porkgrill
40,Take a good camera with a good zoom,"You cant really get that close.. well i couldnt there may be another way.. but i have a good zoom so i was happy.. you can see the sign from alot of places around LA.. i think its the kodak theatre or close by where you can get a great shot on hollywood boulevard, but too many people around when i was able to get there. Its so great to see it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazvrx
50,It's HOLLYWOOD! What else can you say!,"You can see it from all over but you just can't be in LA without seeing it! it's a part of it that just makes you're day & you say ""wow! that's neat!"" you know you've been there!it's amazing to this day how many people ask me did we see it!it's LA!!! drive up and see it! and have a good time!take pics!!!you have to!DON'T leave LA without seeing it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbsurfer1
50,Pictures with the Hollywood sign,We did not hike to the sign. We merely wanted pictures of us in front of the sign. As a previous reviewer said we drove to the end of N. Beachwood Drive. Just keep driving up North Beachwood through neighborhoods of narrow streets until you reach the parking lot just before the horse ranch. There is not much parking but on a weekday in September it was fine. Then hike up a kind of steep path and take pictures of yourself with the sign behind you. Perfect and free of course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelpfulMichele
40,I have a fear of heights.,"It is about a two mile trek from the base to the top. It might be a little tough if you're out of shape. There are some great views, but I have a terrible fear of heights. There are no trees or plants hugging the outer edge and I kept thinking there would be nothing to grab onto if I happened to fall. It is a long way down. I was mostly hugging the hill and the paths are wide enough to keep me from the steep drop. I couldn't really see the sign at the top, only pieces of the letters, but I still think it's worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leeinnyc84
40,"If you want to visit the Hollywood Sign, here's a good way","The Hollywood sign is an icon, and if you want to go see it, the views make it worth it. The hike itself is wide jeep trails and paved park roads. There are two trail heads - one at the end of Canyon Drive (6.5 mi RT) and the one I did at the end of North Beachwood Drive (3.75 mi RT). GPS to the trailhead is 4800 North Beachwood Dr. (note Beach not Beech) Los Angeles. Walk through the gap at the top of the small (12 car) parking lot just before the horse ranch and turn left uphill. When you come to the sharp switchback, turn left on it. Going straight takes you, eventually, to the Griffith observatory. When you arrive at the paved park road, you have a choice. Turning left takes you along a flat walk to a good view below the sign looking up. Turning right takes you up the hill to the top of Mt Lee, where you can overlook the back of the sign for a great view of Los Angleles and Palos Verdes in the distance. This is where the characters in ""Friends with Benefits"" went in the movie, before they jumped the fence. (a lower fence in the movie than the real one - and don't jump the fence; the area is monitored with many cameras and the real police much less forgiving than the movie police). To get photos without the fence, continue uphill and up to the top of the bluff where the large radio tower is. You can shoot down over the top of the fence, and get an even better view. ILook over the second ""L"" in the sign to see (in October 2011) a ""Tourists Go Away"" sign in the back yard of a boxy overdesigned house below. This year some local residents, in the honored tradition of ""I'm the last one in"" are trying to block easy access to the trail. Seize your rights!Get there early or late to improve your chances of finding a parking space - it fills up quickly. We got there late, 10 am on a Sunday, but were lucky as early risers were finishing their walks. From the car to the sign and back, with ample time for photo shooting, took us 1 hr 15 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markinRB
40,Hollywood sign review,"The hollywood sign is los Angeles' main landmark you can't miss it, but it's very small from far away buy I saw it from the Griffith Observatory and it's pretty big I was looking at the wrong side until I saw it it wasn't hard to miss. Overall it was a pretty good sight",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edgar0161
40,Everyone should try!,"I understand not letting ppl go right up to the sign. Too many ppl would paint on it, thimk they must leave their mark and trash the place with litter. There are plenty of little streets that you can get a good photo esp if you have any telephoto capability. Its almost impossible to get a good shot from farther away. I found more days than not that due to smog/pollution that you cant see the Hollywood hills much less the sign. You have to get closer on a side street or miss it altogether. There are not very many smog free days there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolaqueen
50,Best view of the Hollywood Sign!,"I got this information from a blog and the view was just wonderful, plus pics were super good too! Just type the address listed below into your GPS (you will think that you are going the wrong way, but just keep going)3204 Canyon Lake Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90068Parking is tricky (since there are no parking signs all around the entire area) but everyone seemed to park whereever they wanted. Also, we walked about a half mile up the mountain and got an even closer view (& took cool pics!)It's near Lake Hollywood Park which is beautiful as well.This is a MUST see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TxOCDMOM
50,"Excellent hike, very pretty.","I would recommend this for the active traveler. It's a wonderful, simple hike with fantastic views and you're right behind the Hollywood sign! make sure to follow the directions, turn up the first switch back on the dirt road and then turn right onto the paved road. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/160jenp
20,Very disappointed. Very small and couldn't get close,We asked a local Police Officer where is the best place to get close to the sign. He told us you could not right now and the best place to see it was from the viewing platform of the shopping arcade behind the Kodak Theatre.We walked up there and as the sign is so small the photos we took were rubbish. It was impossible to get photos of us with the sign behind us. The Major of Holkywood should get bigger letters!!Glad we saw it but not impressed,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PassportUK
50,This is a beautiul place...,This site gives you great direction to see and hike to the Hollywood Signhttp://www.overthehollywoodsign.com/Overthehollywoodsign/Welcome.html,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hollyh_11
40,Great to see,Really nice to see - different to what i imagined.We did a horse ridding trek up to the sign which was good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBW2009
40,"Can't get very close, but it's still cool to see","Unfortunately you cannot get very close to the sign ... I totally thought you could walk really close to it, but our guide told us that it is getting pretty old and they are trying to preserve it by not letting anyone near it. I was able to get some great shots of it with my camera just off the lookout spot of Mulholland Drive, but the pictures with my husband and I are hard to see the actual sign unless you know where you are looking. The view of the city from that spot is almost better than the sign, but it was still pretty cool to actually see the history. Overall, a must see when in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindzngreg
50,A must see.,Such an amazing experience. The sign is fenomenal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/princesspm
40,Must see this if in LA,What can I say it is an icon everybody knows this from the movies. Must see this if in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttoDerFlieger
50,Walk right up to the sign...it's worth the trip!,"Before I went to the sign I researched the 'best' way to hike to it on many sites. The one I choose worked awesome and I want to share some tips. First, dive to 3400 North Beachwood Drive in Hollywood. As you‚Äôre driving up Beachwood Drive you‚Äôll have some excellent views of the sign if you want to take some pictures. This location is actually a horse stable, but you can park right near the stables. You can‚Äôt miss the trail from this location. It's obviously mostly uphill, but it's not real extreme; I walked it in sandals, though I recommend more appropriate footwear. About 5-7 minutes into the walk the trail double-backs to the left in a u-turn manner; take this u-turn even though another part of the trail continues straight ahead. Once on this part of the trail you'll get to a paved road in 7-10 minutes; turn right and then be patient as the paved road winds it way up and around the hill eventually leading to the back of the Hollywood sign! You can only approach the sign from the back and get as close as about 100 yards. The back of the sign is really the best place to be because of the view of Hollywood and LA down below. The whole hike from the parking area to the sign is about 40 minutes. I suggest bringing some water with you on the hike, but if you drink a fair amount before heading up you should also be fine. Don't miss this when in the LA area; it's fun, a nice workout and the views will make it worth it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kpf1965
20,"A must see, but quite a disapointing one",This is one of those great examples where expectations are not fulfilled.I recommend everybody to do something else like spending time at venice beach;),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andressmith
40,A must...beautiful and relaxing.,"After an afternoon at the Hollywood Walk of Fame, we decided to take a nice, relaxing drive up Muholland Drive. There is a look out point to see LA and a beautiful view of the Hollywood Sign. We took a family picture with the Hollywood sign in the background; what a time to remember!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AthenaP1
30,What a walk to view the sign,"You cant get up that close to the Hollywood sign, however if you drive towards it you can get pretty close by driving toward the riding stables. You will see a hand painted sign that says 'To Hollywood Sign' You then have to follow the dirt track up a 'very' steep hill & you can look across at the Hollywood sign - I guess this is the nearest you get to it.If you look the other way you get a fantastic view of LA.My suggestion is take a bottle of water with you - its not far but it is steep (or maybe I am just unfit!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orchid028
40,Definitely Worth Seeing,"We were staying in Santa Monica and definitely wanted to see one of the most popular sights in LA, the Hollywood sign. We found the most convenient way to accomplish this, by heading to the viewing point at on Canyon Lake Drive. The exact address is 3000 Canyon Lake Drive.If you get car sick, this may not be the road trip for you, however we enjoyed it. There are great views along the way. When you get there, you get great views of the sign and the LA skyline. Perfect for taking pictures.So I would definitely suggest making this trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachLifer21
40,Neat way to see LA,Me and my family drove up to the sign this was my first time for the drive and needless to say we enjoyed it winding roads and narrow but most people you pass live on the hill so they pull over to let you pass and you do the same we were able to park right at the gate entry walk to the cliff and see all the fireworks for the forth over the city Must do !!! try it you will like it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wewafinest
40,Okay that's far away !,We could see it anywhere but still it is far away ! We did not have the time to go up there,
40,Smaller than we thought but well worth seeing,"When you think about Hollywood you think about the sign. We had gone on a tour which included going to view the sign but out view was on the other side of the valley so the sign did look very small to us, you need a good zoom on your camera. I was a bit gutted as wanted a picture of ourselves with the sign in the background you can barely see the sign. You can see the sign from the Hollywood highlife centre, if you go towards the back where the restaurants are there is a walkway from this you get a view of the sign, again a bit small but with a zoom you will get a few good pictures.",
40,hot!,"We took what I guess is the alternative hike, from Beachwood Drive. Unlike the other hike, you don't approach from the bottom of the sign, so I would guess the other has better photo ops as you hike up. If you choose to go all the way to the top, you will end up at the same place, tho, regardless of where you start. If you take Beachwood drive, google"" Hollywood sign hikes or trails"", and you will find a good website which gives you a couple of hints about which routes to take when the trail splits.It was wicked hot. I mean wicked hot. We made the first turn onto the ridgeline and the heat just hit us like a wall. About 100 yds in, the kids were already complaining about being hot and tired. Given that they'd spent the last 3 days complaining that they wanted to go to the sign, I wasn't having any of that. Do bring at least one bottle of water per person, and perhaps a snack for those whose blood sugar tends to fluctuate. Hats are recommended, and sunscreen is a must.The views are amazing if you happen to get a clear day, like we did. Don't think you'll be able to stand at the base of the sign, tho. The path takes you up above the sign, and a tall fence and warnings of fines and arrest surround the sign. So, you climb to the top and get to look down on it and the surroundings. A little bit of a letdown after about an hour of uphill travel. I'd still do it once, tho, just to see the area from up high, and to be able to check off ""climb to the Hollywood sign"" off my lifetime to-do list.",
50,Very scenic and invigorating,"The hike to the Hollywood sign was great. It is a bit confusing when you get to the destination, 3390 Deronda Blvd, and thanks to whomever posted this address for the GPS. It worked great. When you get to this location the parking lot is padlocked, but you can park on the side of the street and walk up to the left of the locked gate. There is an arched walkway to the trail which is basically a road that is not used anymore unless you are a park system vehicle. You can walk all the way up to the sign, and there are some dirt trails off of the road on your way up. Definitely wear comfortable shoes and sunscreen/light clothing if in the summer. You can get great pictures of the city from here. Would recommend to any outdoor enthusiast. Recommended for generally fit people.",
10,Traffic nightmare up there.....#@%$#&#&,We went up Deronda Dr. like some have posted to do and $#%$##&^ what a nightmare. We came back to our car and it was scraped all along the side. There is so much traffic trying to maneuver on a narrow street. And you can't actually get to the Hollywood sign anyway. So any place you can see it isn't really much different than anywhere else you can see it. Somebody at the coffee shop said there is an area with more room for parking at the end of Beachwood Drive that you can start a good hike up hills around it. Maybe next time.,
50,Walking Trail to Top of Hollywood Sign,"If you punch in 3390 Deronda into your GPS, it will take you directly to the trail that leads to the top of the HOLLYWOOD sign. It is the only legal way to get right next to the sign. The most amazing view of Los Angeles from up there. You can't drive your car up there, but if you walk through the gate, you can access the trail on foot. Enjoy...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HHood
50,What a great tour guide!,"Decided I'd go the more tacky side of Los Angeles and found myself buying a ticket to a Hollywood star Homes tour! I was pleasantly surprised when I had a English tour guide who was funny, knowledgeable, had a book filled with photos in case we didn't know the celebrities being talked about and knew some secret streets most tours don't go on!! Mike was one of the best tour guides I've ever had and added a funny element to the tour! It's worth doing and try and choose Mike!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jakeling
50,Very cool experience,"We decided to do a pre-sunset trip up the foothills of the city below the Hollywood sign in order to get some great photos and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of advice from other visitors. Although we wanted to hike up to get near the sign, we decided to follow the advice of one reviewer and get as close as we could on the city's streets.We set our GPS to 3384 Deronda Dr. as advised by one person, and set off up the narrow, winding, uphill streets toward that destination. Deronda Dr. is in a somewhat exclusive-looking neighborhood in the foothills below the sign. In the very late afternoon light, we were actually challenged by the darkness of the streets as we approached. Deronda Dr. is barely one car-width, so proceed with caution as you wind up the hill. The neighbors know this is a popular place to visit, and have a variety of items in their driveways to keep unwanted visitors from parking in their driveways, which is understandable.When we approached the end of the Drive, we found the ideal spot to be at 3374 Deronda Dr. We did a tight y-turn of the car and parked curbside where we took some really fantastic pictures of the family with the sign in the background. All I can say is that this has to be the best place from which to see the sign. As a courtesy to those in the neighborhood, please exercise caution during your trip and make an effort to maintain some sense of respect for their privacy and their property. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottjens
40,A Must Do,"If you are going to LA, the first thing that usually pops into your head is the Hollywood sign, and for that, it's a must do. I really enjoyed taking pictures of the sign from the Griffith Observatory. It was a whole lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nationalparkfreak
40,You've got to go! It THE SIGN!,"Ok, so it's the symbol of Hollywood and you can see it from nearly everywhere in downtown LA but it's worth a trip up the Mtn to get a bit closer.We found some guys running a trip up and they threw in a free trip if we did a circle tour too, which was fine seeing we were first timers.If you love the 'touristy thing' to get the feel of a place, the guide can tell you who lives where, what used to be here or there and about different landmarks you wouldn't give a thought to otherwise.Definitely worth it - just for the photo opportunities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mmoo73
50,Hollywood Sign Hike,"Hiking to the top of Mount Lee, just above the Hollywood Sign letters, is one of my favorite things to do in Los Angeles. The trailhead for the shortest route that I know of is on North Beachwood Drive near Sunset Ranch. During the hike, there are views of Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Griffith Observatory, Burbank, Forest Lawn cemetery, Walt Disney Studios, and NBC Studios. There is an excellent review of the Hollywood Sign Hike along with a map and beautiful photos at mydreamcametrue.com/hollywoodsign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4amazingadventures
40,Fun! Take a hike up through the area!,"Of course you have to see the Hollywood Sign! We were excited to see it so we decided to take a trip up to the sign. We drove up the hills that were packed with houses that were practically on top of one another. It was neat to see all of the houses on the way up to the sign because they were very unique. So we finally came to a sign that said Hollywood Sign ->, which was nice. We made it up there and parked. We decided to take a little hike to get closer and it was worth it. Gorgeous views of the houses built into the Hollywood Hills. Had great views of the sign too. Do yourself a favor and take a look around the area, It's beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ_432
50,a must do! an LA tradition!,"There's no way you can visit the Los Angeles area without making the hike up to see the Hollywood sign. Beautiful drive, great for photo ops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beach_Bug13
50,LOVE THE HOLLYWOOOD SIGN,"I moved to the Hollywood area about 1941. I was about 6 years old.We lived on the hillside on Griffith Park Blvd. My father enclosed our back deck with glass panels and made it into a bedroom for my sisters and I. It was during WWII and each night when we went to our ""bedroom"" I would see the Hollywood sign. In those days we had black outs and all Whenever they had a Hollywood premiur the large spot lights came out and we could view all of it from our ""bedroom"". It was wonderful !! We lived in this house until after WWII when we moved.Ahhh, memories wonderful memories of years and days gone by . I love the ...... HOLLYWOOD SIGN !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorcieMitchell
40,What can I say...... It's a sign..... But...,What can I say...... It's a sign..... But you can't come to Hollywood without seeing it! I'm pretty lazy so we drove up to the closest point and got a few family snaps from there. Definately worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hyperboy78
50,My Kids loved the adventure,This is a must do in LA. My kids loved the adventure. I honest feel sorry for the homes at the end of this street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bidderman9
40,Trail with a view and a dog park,"My boyfriend and I wanted to go on a hike that would take us to nice views of the Hollywood sign so we relied mainly on the hollywood sign website to select a trail. We chose the Canyon Lake Dr. trail because it is the closest you can legally get to the sign. The website is right, it's very difficult to find because the road does alot of winding through Hollywood Hills and Hollywoodland, the drive was nice though as all the houses are very neat and big. The ""hike"" was really more a 20 minute, flat, dirt trail. I wish it had been more athletic and nature-y, but I guess if you're not much of an outdoors person or physically active it would be a good walk for you.We took my boyfriend's dog with us because the website said that one end of the trail was connected to a dog park. When we got to the end there was indeed a very nice but small dog park. The grass was lush and green, there were many other dogs playing, and there was a water fountain with a bowl for dogs. Overall the hike wasn't what I was expecting but we did get some cool pictures of the sign, we were very very close to it, and the dog enjoyed himself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khaki83
50,"Just a sign, but a must-do attraction","We got as close as you can legally get to the Hollywood sign, awesome photos! Anyone looking to get a good shot, just put the address into your GPS of 3384 Deronda Dr. Los Angeles, CA. It's on a public street, just about 200 ft before the road is closed off to public access. Perfect view of the sign, and you can't get any closer, legally! NOTE; the HOLLYWOOD sign is NOT lit up at night time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millon9
40,Worth the trip...albeit..,"We recently visited LA/Hollywood from the east coast and took a drive to view the famous sign..thanks to the directions given in an earlier review out here...only to see a partially covered sign with the lettering ""HOVE THE WOOK"" (it was supposed to read ""SAVE the PEAK"" during the week)..but anyways...I would also recommend an alternate view from Canyon Lake Dr ..which we liked more than the Holly ridge trail...google directions from the Holly Ridge Trail to Canyon Lake Dr, Hollywood and follow the winding roads with view of several mansions on the hill..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tp2009

50,A great LA activity,"Research the directions to Hollyside Trail in the reviews below and make it a nice morning hike up above the sign. Very worth it, a good little exercise, and cool views of this enormous area. Not a tough hike, but wear comfortable shoes and bring water and a camera. Expect to spend 1.5-2 hours and enjoy!The drive through the surrounding neighborhood is pretty amazing too, mansions galore!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natjaye
40,Not as glamours as it looks on TV but still a must see in Hollywood.,I have been to the Hollywood sign 3 times. I usually view it at the end of Mulholland drive. Good directions are listed in prior reviews. Everyone has seen this sign on TV but to see it in person is really something. It shows you how Hollywood is all an illusion. On TV it looks like grand letters all lit up on the side of a mountain. In reality it looks like tall letters made out of painted plywood or something. You really only need to see it once but every time people come to visit I take them to see it. It is good for a few snapshots and to be able to say you have seen it close up. I will be back there again when my son and daughter-in-law come to visit in February.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z4589CMlindad
50,Hiking up by the Hollywood sign was one of our favorite things to do in LA.,"We had a great time hiking on the trails up by the Hollywood sign! Other reviewers below captured the info on how to get up here so I won't repeat them in this review (and thanks other reviewers for all the great details - they helped out a lot!).This was one of the most fun things we did on this trip. We hiked until our 4 year old got tired, but still we put quite a few clicks on the pedometer. The view from up by the sign is beautiful, and you can really see a long ways down into the valley.Only caution (other than snakes - we didn't see any though) is to watch the young ones closely since the sides of the trail can have steep drop-offs so you need to stay near the trail centers with the little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FamilyVacationsMN
50,Evocative area where you imagine Bogart to Laurel & Hardy in the Hollywood Hills,"Worth searching out the best view of sign by threading your way via narrow & steep roads up towards the sign. Directed the last few yards by local inhabitant Ted who guided us to white wall with black locked double gates walk to one side onto unmade path only 50 metres walk for the best view of sign directly underneath it you can see detail & scale unable to get closer as all secured. Turn around fantastic view across LA towards downtown & Griffith Observatory by keeping this side of the hill area will see you on this route. Hollywood Hills human in scale, secluded beautifully maintained properties diverse a place where most people would love to reside almost a village feel this Santa Monica,Calabasas & Little Venice would be dream places to live. Beverly Hills, Bel Air et al a little too fabricated in feel and bereft of any people/life behind their huge walls/gates hugely impressed with LA the Americans very friendly generous people just a great place to be and so much to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrightonHappychappy
50,A must for all LA visitors,You can see the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood/highland centre which is on the walk of fame. However it is well worth the trek to try and get right up close. If you drive up Beachwood drive (one block over from Hollywood Boulevard) and then go up Ledgewood you can drive really close and get great pics. You have to ignore the signs that say no access to the sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jkshibley
40,"Shop n See the Famous ""Hollywood"" Sign!","We went to Hollywoow/Higland Ave. to see the famous Hollywood sign. It was visible where we were at. A lot of shops (i.e. LV, Coach, Gaps) in the area.Another great location is near near Rob Reiner's Walk of Fame Star. You can see it thru the empty lot.

40,Hike to the sign - it's not your typical tourist activity,"My wife, two kids (ages 7 and 9), and I recently spent two weeks in the LA area. I was searching Google for information on where to best see the Hollywood sign and we decided to hike to the Hollywood sign as documented on the site http://hollywoodsigntrip.com/. The hike was was very easy to do (my kids did it without complaint) and took us just under two hours to do from end-to-end with lots of time for photos at the top. Make sure you bring water to drink. It was warm when we did it in late February so it is probably pretty hot come summer time.The views of Los Angeles and Orange County from the top of the mountain are amazing and the environment is a relief from the hustle and bustle of LA. Doing the hike also makes for a great post-vacation story since most people are not aware that you can get that close to the sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ITAlchemy
40,A MUST see while in Hollywood!,"I have been to the Hollywood sign several times, especially when I lived in San Diego and had visitors.We also rode horses at the stable nearby, and if you can ride horses and love the outdoors, DO IT!The Hollywood sign is an fantastic piece of Los Angeles history, and is just as majestic as it sounds...a definite destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewMexicoCruiser
40,Hard to find! But great piece of nostalgia!,This sucker is hard to find! We drove all around Griffith Park (the park that it is located in) and could not find it at all!

I would suggest just doing that and not going out of your way to try to find it or see it up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripulartravels
