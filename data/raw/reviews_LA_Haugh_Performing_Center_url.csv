40,Excellent venue for a concert,A very well designed modern performing arts venue. Lots of free parking. Reasonable prices. Comfortable seats with lots of leg room. Had lots of fun. Easy out of parking lot and quick access back to freeway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
10,Obsessive and not family-friendly.,"I took my wife and three kids to the Christmas play with what seemed to be a bunch of school groups. We were ready for Christmas spirit! The ergonomics of parking, walking to the sidewalk and purchasing the daily $5 permit at the kiosk, and then walking BACK to display it in the windshield -with three small children in tow- is quite unfortunate. It was all kids and chaperones in attending the show, which met out expectations. Staff was mostly friendly, show was entertaining, but my word these people were obsessive with their RULES. We had an usher hover next to my family specifically who obsessively watched my wiggly five year old son until he put up his feet and she swooped down past me like a a hawk. Considering that I and my wife were at the end of the row, I believe that both social convention and convenience would have dictated that she speak to us about his behavior. I was also asked to leave the theatre while I fed my 1.5 year old daughter an applesauce packet to help her remain civil for the benefit of other guests. And yes, these folks had me pay full price for her seat. Here's the most un-hospitable part - upon exiting I was greeted with a parking violation. FOR BACKING IN TO MY SPOT. To add insult to injury, the payment on your violations is excessively short as well as steep. These college kids are working hard and putting on what we though was an enjoyable show that we could enjoy yearly, but after costing me an extra $80 on top of our tickets and making my family highly uncomfortable in the process, the administration has definitely ensured that my growing family of 5 will never be back to support them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigB159
50,Beauty and the Beast,I took my 12 year old daughter to see Beauty and the Beast and it was amazing. The special affects were phenomenal. The acting was superior. It was well worth the money. Theatre was clean and staff was very helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amybF5831NB

40,A Nice Venue foir a Small Community,"Haugh Performing Arts Center is a nice enough theater, especially for a Jr. college. There are no sight line problems but the acoustics are not consistently reliable. For some performances they are better than others. This is a good venue for comedians, one person shows and small musical ensembles. They have some good acts booked here and many fillers that probably more than satisfy the older patrons in the community. Parking is free (which is always nice) and audiences are always pleasant and appreciative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkh2015
50,City College Performing Arts Center,"Great programs by the local city college performing art students. Plays, musical, and orchestral presentations. Professionals periodically play this venue, but whether it is the student artists or professionals, you are sure to go away with a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenJack
50,A Local Performing Arts Gem in Glendora,"The Haugh Performing Arts Center is a little local gem in Glendora. The Haugh is conveniently located off the 210 freeway and can also be reached by the Metro Goldline. In fact, you can walk from the APU/Citrus College Goldline station to The Haugh which is located on the campus of Citrus College. Each year, they release their show schedule around late July or early August and feature shows through June. The types of shows they book each year are diverse and change every year. The staff at the Haugh are very friendly and I've even attended shows where they pass out a short questionnaire requesting feedback about what types of performances and shows they should offer. I will say there is always a variety with performances geared for adults and they also incorporate family programming. Each December, the Haugh hosts a Christmas/Holiday themed performance. They typically schedule a few performances of the Christmas show to the public but they also have a reserved schedule for school performances. I've had the opportunity to attend the Haugh with the school performance and they fill up the seats! I also enjoy attending performances at the Haugh because they are high quality and the cost is very reasonable. You can purchase tickets online or go to the box office which normally opens at 11am during the week. Once you purchase tickets to one of their shows, they add you to their mailing list and will send their annual brochure and any other special show they would like to promote. Overall, I will be back in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onedeesse

Parking is FREE.I took my 2 year old to his first play here for The Little Train that Could. I was so nervous thinking is he going to last or are people going to look at us while he is being loud (a toddler).This was a great experience and I can't wait for the 2010-2011 season to begin in November.If your kid acts up or is loud he/she is not the only one and everybody there understands. The theater is gorgeous too.socalpocketmemories.blogspot,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalpcktmemories
