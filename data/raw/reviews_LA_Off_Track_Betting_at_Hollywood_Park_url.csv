30,Gone. Demolished. Huge future,Gone. Demolished. Huge future. Perhaps football stadiums are the new racetracks. I hope some relic is included in the new stadium. But I doubt that will occur. Los Angeles is short on nostalgia.,Cavydad
40,Table games,"I played a new game where you get 2 cards then decide to play them as Blackjack or Poker. A fun game but I lost. You can order food and eat at the table. I did it but I don't like it, people touch chips and cards with dirty hands. THey have money wheel that you can spin on certain daysto win up to $1000. You get entries by getting a 'high hand'. I was there on a Tuesday and I saw a guy win the $1000 so it does happen. Each game I played costs $1 to play so the house always gets something. They also have Blackjack, Pai Gow (poker and tiles), Texas Hold 'Em. They also have regular poker tables and I didn't see any slots. THey have a few places to eat including a deli. Sodas are free and they use walkie-talkies to call the waitress. ATMs also inside. I got there and back using Lyft but bus 117 goes by too.",frederick b

20,No park in lieu of the stadium,We were staying right across in the motel. We wanted to check the park and we say it was taken out for the construction of the stadium. Skip the visit if you are planning one.,SanAsh
10,Oh! It's gone,They removed Hollywood park to make room the the new football stadium. The Los Angeles RAMS are back in LA and the Chargers are going to play football in the same stadium. In 2018,Charles C

10,OMG Want a Ghetto Casino...go to the Ghetto,"This had to be the most ghetto place i have ever been to. Went to go and watch a kickboxing fight last night and had the most horribly memorable experience so far in the USA. I first felt like i was walking across the TJ bridge to TJ from the USA when we entered through the side entrance.Every inch of carpet was stained and disgusting. They never clean this place. Every urinal and toilet was disgusting. They had yellow filth in every bowel. The seats we sat at had sticky stuff all over the floor and my leather shoes would constantly stick to the floor. Everything is painted in a pink motif and they were due for a remodel about 40 years ago.The 3 things they offered to eat were all bad. Hotdogs, Popcorn and Nachos. Do yourself a huge favor and eat before you go.",Eric G

50,Love this place,"My 12 year old and I came here for vacation and had a great time. The attractions, the walks, the unique stores, everything we did was worth the money and time.. Can't wait to return in the summer where there will be more to see and do!!",natlove007
10,Review by a foreign tourist,"I went in for simple curiosity and I must have spent 2 minutes in there and walked out. To the people who say fun for the home family what are they thinking? These place is not for families. I mean I only now learned theres a racetrack and dont know about that but the casino is awful. A lot of sketchiness and an overall bad tone to the atmosphere. I guess as a tourist you expect something like a vegas casino. This is nothing like it, its a warehouse with tables. Nothing nice or elegant about it. Also the surrounding area doesnt seem very nice. Just not a place for tourists dont go there.",Mateo R
30,Again just ok.,Convenient to the airport but nothing special. The tournaments I was in were very small. And the games were so-so.You can go if you are nearby but no special trip for this one. Had some nice snacks .,Robert L

10,Will find another casino,"I have been here 5 or 6 times. They were bad before, they are worse now under new owners. The worst rip off poker room that I have ever been to, even by California standards.The rake is abusive. They rake $5 from every hand as long as there is any betting. Sometimes the house takes more from the pot than the winner of the pot. They rake $1 from every hand, even if hand isnâ€™t played and the big and small blind chop the pot. When a player leaves the table in some positions, they make three players post the blinds for several hands. It makes no sense. They are just stealing more money from the players.There incentive program is almost non-existent. Half the regulars donâ€™t even bother. On my last trip I played about 25 hours. I received $5 in cash back. They make you re-swipe your playerâ€™s card on every new dealer. Most of the dealers donâ€™t bother to tell players that they need to swipe when they come to the table. If you want to use your incentive for food, you must go to one of their few machines, swipe, get a coupon, and give to the server. The server wonâ€™t do it for you.At my table, one of the players became abusive. He was a regular. He shouted ethnic slurs at another player. House didnâ€™t even caution him. I make it a point to be the most polite player at the table. I mucked one hand one of my cards accidently went in the dealers chip tray. I was hassled by the floor person who said that I threw my cards at the dealer. No such thing happened. The next day, two players were making death threats against one another on the other table. Although they did warn the players and bring out a few security guards, they did not kick out the players. They should have been banned.The food is not very good or a good deal.The only reason that I have played here is that it is very close to the airport and I frequently stay at hotels in the LAX area. Time to find a new casino near LAX.",Pokerroamer
20,Say Goodbye to Hollywood,"After years of swirling rumors of the imminent sale of this once famous racetrack where the stars came out to watch and bet on the once great horses that coveted this track of the Lakes and Flowers as it was known, steeped in racing history some of America's most famous racing legends thundered into the history books there, including the great Dr. Fager my personal favorite in the Californian where he toted a hefty 130 lbs where destroyed his feeble competition and also the many grade1 stakes the nations last Triple Crown winner Affirmed won in each of the three years he competed, my favorite being his thrilling victory in the Hollywood Gold Cup where he ran a 1\5 off the world record.Lets not forget the first ever Breeder's Cup was held there back in 1984 and more recently the home of the great Zenyatta that became one of the recent big draws for racing fans everywhere, I for one will be sad to see it close its doors after this final fall meeting. I worked there for many years and it was a better surface to train your horses on as opposed to the very hard Santa Anita surface that is continually changing.",April D
40,Last trip to Hollywood park,"We love this horse track and always have a good time when we go there. It is closing at the end of the year for good, so we thought we would take one last trip on July 5. Free parking, $10 general admission and we found great seats overlooking the finish line (we got there about 60 minutes early). Beer was $1, can't beat that!! The track was very crowded, but a good crowd. The only thing we saw was someone had dropped a $20 bill and another person picked it up and walked away not giving it back to person who lost it...karma folks...",Sue T
40,Horse racing,We had a great time at the race track and even won some money. This is an older building that will be closing soon. Food choices are slim but they do have a bar. It's a nice place to relax and watch the ponies run. We were told that it will be torn down in the next year to make way for a shopping mall ( they don't need anymore of these),beech3242
10,Hated The Hollywood Park Casino,"I only went to the Hollywood Park Casino, not the racetrack. But I hated it.Lots of low life characters. If you play blackjack they use an automatic shuffling machine after every hand to increase the house odds. I hated that also! I will not go there again. Drive to Casino Morongo instead (on the way to Palm Springs). It is much nicer.",JohnB00007

20,only for a gambling fix,"Have never had a problem here, it just is nowhere near as clean, nice, or up to date like Santa Anita or Del Mar. More degenerates here than the other tracks I mentioned. I'll go if I need a gambling fix :-)",travlinmav
10,Here's mud on your face,"Compared to the elegant background of the San Gabriel Mountains at Santa Anita Racetrack- this race track is a truly skeazy experience. Hollywood Park is home to gambling addicts, sad-eyed bartenders and their desperate brethren... hold on, I am making this place sound better than it is. A slice of un-romantic modern LA as painted by Charles Bukowski",Vacannes
50,Great,"So great, we will definately to there again. There are many things that we did not have time to watch it. Pls bring the raincoat with you when you visit the universal studio",Sissi L
30,"A faded rose, but still worth the trip","Hollywood Park used to be the gilded lily of the horse racing world. On any given day, you would see the creme de la creme of the golden age of Hollywood. Unfortunately, much like that golden age, Hollywood Park's glory days have passed.That being said, it is still a wonderful facility to watch live racing. It is also used by many trainers as a 'home base' and training facility. I have not had the opportunity, but I have been told that many of the trainers are very accommodating to guests in the back stretch.There is a persistant rumor gaining more and more credibility in the horse racing world that Hollywood Park's days are numbered. If you get a chance, go see this grand old dame before she fades away completely.",DeeAnnB
10,"Depressing, not attractive as Santa Anita","Nothing is wrong with this place - it's far away and not in a great area of town, for one thing, and it's kind of junky-sleazy, though one can gamble very adequately. It has none of the charm of Santa Anita or Fenway Park, for example. Horse-racing, yes.",patriciaroseogden
50,Carnival,I loved that entertainment was so close. What I didn't like is that I made it there an hour before closing.,Mrs Valerie D
30,Hollywood Park,"At one time this was the racetrack of the movie stars but it has lost most of its luster , when i first came to California it was 1978 , i saw Geoge Raft there , he was in alot of ganster films and i met Farrah there one more riding one of the trainers ponies , now a days its lucky to get a decent crowd and the last time was when Zenyatta was paraded for the public , alway in the mist of rumors that it has been sold and parts of it already have been developed , like the polo field and Walmart has bought the north parking lot so i'd say there racing days are numbered",April D
40,Great venue for special event,"Lots of fun and support for a non-profit venue for us. Helpful in the betting, Parking is crazy, arrive early. Note: Beautiful Inglewood Park Cemetery is across street to the north.",Anaheim_Marilyn
40,Have a Gamble,"Very dated but a great atmosphere when there is live racing, good old hot dogs chilli and beer. Was fun and a cheap day out, had a bet and won. Lots of Men there but the Clark of the course came up to us and played Advance Australia Fair hilarious",Bryan W
20,Once a proud establishment....,"Once a proud establishment, this place has gone down. Sure it allows for gaming, but the aesthetics are horrible, and the parking lot is always a tenth full. The elements hanging around do not make it enticing. Last time I was there, the decor was dated as well.",IamPC
40,For Casino Gambling and for Private Parties,I have attended Hollywood Park on multiple occasions for private parties in one of the banquet rooms and I think Hollywood Park is great for this. I have never really visited their Casino for gambling.,cgmeigs

20,kind of run down,"It was inexpensive and the food and beer was cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for. But it was kind of run down and depressing. If you like horse races, go to Santa Anita.",carry_0n_traveler
50,An Exciting Day at the Races!,"Lots of sights and sounds to see, lots of excitement, lots of people-watching opportunities, and if you've never spent much time at a horse racing event, lots to learn about betting and the odds of winning, placing, or losing! But don't look at this venue as an sure-fire opportunity to to increase your wealth. The odds are that you'll pay for the excitement.

40,Don' be afraid of going to Hollywood Park Track & Casino,"Was told by several people that it was not safe to go to Hollywood Park Race track due to it's location in Inglewood and that it was a good place to get pickpocketed. I want to let you know it was not that scary. The area surronding the park is not the most scenic but that shouldn't stop you. It's actually only a couple minutes direct drive from two major freeways and so getting lost is not likely. As for pickpockets, I didn't feel or see anyone I would've considered overly suspicious and so don't believe there is a high potential for theft of yourself or cars in the parking lot. There were several families and old ladies so don't be afraid, go and enjoy!",KCandJP
40,My Favorite LA Casino,"I've haven't been to every LA Casino (actually they are Card Rooms; no slot machines); but I have been to The Bicycle, Club Normandie, and Hollywood Park. Of the three, I like Hollywood Park the most. Though it's a little on the beaten site and Inglewood has had better days, Hollywood park has a nice retro feel. For No-Limit Hold'em tournaments, it is the best with resonable buy-ins and nice payouts. I cashed in 2 of 3 over the last weekend.Food is good. You can get a nice prime rib sent right to your table. I do not like eating and playing cards. I do like eating at their ""Pink's Hot Dogs"" eatery. Pink's is an LA institution and they are quite good.Best selling point for Hollywood Park is that it is very close to the Airport and parking is ample.",Cheesesteak_Al
50,"Horses, beer, music - perfect combo","I've been to many of the summer concerts on Friday Nights, and each time is a blast. Its the perfect Friday night to bring a group of friends and pretend like you know what you're doing with the bets.

30,Interesting characters,"A coworker and I were in the LA area and decided to kill time by going to this casino to play poker.First, you drive through some not so great parts of town, but once you are in the casino / race park area, you feel like you are in a separate place.It looks to be a place where locals spend an entire day. They had food trays and sometimes skipped hands to eat.It was my first experience playing cash poker (I play in a monthly tournament style game with friends). I played the $1/$2 no limit table. A few people at the table knew how to play but mostly you had crazy people like the old Chinese woman named Mama who could never figure out if she paid the small blind yet or the overtly gay man trying to work the table with his talk. I ended up making a little money as I played patiently. The poker room had maybe 80-100 tables of various betting amounts.There were also a few blackjack tables (maybe 6) but they were not played much and some of the bets on there were not was I used to so I avoided them.Overall, it was interesting to play in such a place and pretty easy pickings if you are smart and patient.",skopi
