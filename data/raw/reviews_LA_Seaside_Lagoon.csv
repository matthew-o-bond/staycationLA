40,For families with small kids,"Seaside Lagoon is a nice spot for families with small kids who don't like the waves at the nearby beach. This place is a water playground with picnic areas. There's a fee, so check the website or call before you go to make sure you know what you'll need to pay for yourself and family. Bring your own umbrellas, towels, etc.",gr8fish2017
50,Picnic Day,This was a very nice area to hold a private event. Staff is nice and very accommodating. Clean bathrooms and has good shaded areas.,Rachel L
50,Great Beach Without Fish.,"This was a great experience. Families picnicking, hanging out together, swimming, sun bathing. SAFE!!! No sharks. Sunshine and the water was refreshing.",ceeahe
30,Much Improved over the Years,This was a place we used to go as kids decades ago. Over the years the place has been revitalized and improved and now is much nicer than it has ever been. The only down side is that locals don't tend to come here as much as out of towners do. A nice place for kids to play if you don't want them in the actual ocean with the currents and fishes!,CD1970
10,Rash Haven,"The few times my family comes here, my son breaks out in rash. There is something in the water here that cause this allergic reaction. We now try to avoid coming here!!!! Be careful!!!",Ninon P
30,Seasonal ONLY!,"This location is not open during the off season. It is fenced off with no water during the ""winter and spring"" months. It is large and appears to be able to accommodate many people. Again, the ocean is still very cold and it most certainly is not bathing suit weather, that explains why this attraction is not open yet for the 2018 summer season.",Jerseybob175
20,"Might be good place to corral the kids, but this place is...","The Seaside Lagoon might be a good place to corral the kids, but this place is funky. Crowded and dirty. I originally went to a private event and went with some friends that had kids. We left and headed to the beach.",Richard K
50,Great spot to spend the day with the kids,This is a great spot to spend the day with the kids. A nice safe place to swim and play for kids. It is very easy to get to and next to everything in Redondo Beach. Protected from the wind and surf by the sea wall.,S T
30,Good spot for families,The Seaside Lagoon is a good spot to refresh yourself while exploring Redondo Beach. It's also a great spot for relief from the heat when those warm days come around.,buffalojim67
40,walked here from the Redondo Beach hotel,"good for young kids, about 12 and under. not very expensive. You can bring a picnic, and some familys were having birthdays here.",ryan h
50,Cold but lovely,What a wonderful place to spend a few hours with the family. The water is chilly but so clean and fun. Bring a towel and some sand toys- loved it,princesslollipop
30,Great pool +,"This place is a neat! it's a pool with water features / playground right next to the ocean. We were really impressed with how much space there is. You can even picnic here and although we didn't, plenty of people had coolers and food for parties.",JennyB612
20,Not Really for Visitors,"While the lagoon is a place where the kids can have lots of fun, it really is not that clean or a recreation area that can beat the fantastic beaches just down the street. You have to wonder about the quality of the water and the facility maintenance. I would just head for the Redondo or Hermosa Beach and skip this playground",GAM
50,Great Kids Beach,Seaside Lagoon is great for children. There are no waves just beach sand and Mommy's with their children. They have lifeguards. There a restaurant close by for ice cream or whatever you want to eat. There prices have gone up but it is worth a day's worth of fun!!! I would recommend it to everyone with children!!,ourvacation2014
30,Something to do for the kids,"Basically, there's a tube that lets in ocean water into the little man made ""lake"". There's a grate so you don't need to worry about any sea creatures. But again, its ocean water and its cold. Ruby's restaurant has a window facing the park and you can order food there. The water isn't deep and there are no waves or rip tides so you can relax with little children. I think I'd like it better if the young guards there actually walked around the grounds and in the water making sure everything was safe and clean. You're able to bring in your own food, but some people don't know how to clean up after themselves. That's where the workers can actually walk around and keep the place clean.",Msjersey14
20,Dirty and crowded,"The parking is a little confusing and watch that you don't end up at a yacht place. It's $7 per adult and $6 per kid, but the water is super dirty - I saw used bandaids and other disgusting pieces of trash in the water, also saw people spitting. Since the water doesn't connect to anything, all this stuff just stays in until they clean it. Other than a shallow saltwater puddle (deepest point is about 3 ft), there is not much to do. There is a little playground, and a couple of water fountains, but otherwise hard to keep the kids entertained. Also, it's very crowded - both on the beach and in the water. Will probably not come back.",Yulia M
30,Fun for kids!,"My 4 year old daughter enjoyed playing in the sand. She didn't get to swim much though coz the water was too cold (though it was 90 then). She didn't get to use the kid's slides too coz they require a swim test first; now she's begging for swimming lessons :)Parking tickets can be validated by nearby restos as Captain Kidd's and Ruby's.They have no shower rooms, just 3 cubicles you can dress up at. They only have open shower area. The bathrooms have wet and sandy floors (understandably) but it was dirty and stinky :(",Christina B
20,not the best place in town,"this place is getting a little run down, it has alot of out of control children and parents that do not pay attention. During the summer it can be over crowded and people just run into one another and some are too drunk to stand at times. not recommended",Marcthornton1
40,Nostalgic summer-time fun,"My family had a pass to the Lagoon every summer when I was a kid, and I did the same when my kids were little. I'm now a grandmother and have taken my grandson a couple of times. He had a blast, but it can get pretty crowded and the water is colder than I remember from years past. Young kids can't stay in more than a few minutes without getting chilled.",slabate
40,"Unique - basically a saltwater, shallow swimming pool surround by beach","We went here today as part of a big group. Our 2nd time here. It is one of the more interesting and unique places in southern California, I don't know another like it. It is basically a big sand bottomed swimming pool, ocean water pumped in, with sandy beaches surrounding it and a couple of short water slides into the deeper end of the ""pool.""It's great for families with small children as most of the water is less than 4 fee deep, the whole place is fenced in so very safe and the kids can play on the sand/beach without worrying about waves.The admission price is very reasonable. Given you have to pay something to get in also makes it a bit less crowded than the free beach nearby. I would definitely go back.",hoonieskang
30,Grandson birthday party,To expensive for entrance fees and party reservation fees. Water is absolutely filthy and germ ready. Who has a kids beach and the jungle gym is taped off.,Susan G
50,Summertime fun,Great spot for kids to cool off in Summer. Weekends pack up quickly and many schools and camps attend. Kids always have a blast!,jeff M
20,Lagoon,The water was very cloudy and it was so crowded when we went there so my kids did not like it. I liked the picnic area where my kids played with football. They also played in the sand.,sindu s
40,Really good for little kids,"the place is packed with kids and parents having a splashing good time! Lots of pool toys, plenty of room even with a big crowd.",Av8trx90277
40,Nice summer fun,"Went with son, daughter and two grandkids on July 4th. Very enjoyable, nice lagoon with fountains, water slides for kids. Salad, hamburgers, hot dogs, drinks from Ruby's Diner. One of the best July 4 celebrations.",Tuyet Hong H
10,Extremely Overcrowded!,"When I was a kid in the 80's, my parents would bring me here to the Seaside Lagoon. I remember how much I loved coming as a kid. I moved about an hour East of Redondo, but decided to take my kids, to show them a piece of my childhood.We arrived about 20 minutes after opening time - 10:20am. I had planned to arrive early, so we could leave early and beat the traffic back home. When we walked up, there was already about 2-3 buses FULL of camp kids unloaded waiting by the gate. At this point, I was already thinking ""oh man..."" I went ahead (regretfully) and paid the $25 for myself and my 3 kids to enter. My little ones immediately went into the water, and were happily splashing around until WHOOSH! The wave of the hundred+ or so kids came screaming, yelling and running into the gates like a herd of bulls.They then ALL swarmed into the water. The lifeguard was continuously yelling through his ""loudspeaker"". I watched and waited for about 15 more minutes. I look over and ANOTHER 2-3 buses pull up. I thought, ""oh, heck no""... got my kids and we bailed.I wasn't the only parent there that was uncomfortable. I noticed at least 5 other families, looking confused and distraught at the chaos that was unfolding, some making comments that were loud enough for me to hear.I am very disappointed, and will never return. They should have a maximum occupancy posted, not just for comfort, but for safety as well. I cannot imagine a few lifeguards being able to accurately watch over hundreds of children splashing about.",Brandi K
50,Kid friendly,"We went there yesterday and I must say it's ok. Its a small area kiddie oriented, especially if you have kids that like to run off. For a party or school outing, where you want to minimise the space your child can go but for myself noting that I live a proximate the same distance from long beach, I would rather drive to mothers beach and pay nothing. Not even parking if your lucky.",Sandra S
20,Cold scummy water,Title says it all. After our visit we couldn't wait to take a proper shower. And we were not there on a busy day. Very light crowd and yet the water was still covered in an oily film. Water seemed as cold as the ocean. Cleaning staff were busy but other staff seemed unengaged. No lockers. No towels. Minimal facilities. Nice food service from the diner. Next time we will just go to the beach.,Yarbogash
50,Family Friendly,"I have been coming to SL for many many years. Every year I have reserved a table and bbq for my family. We start cooking breakfast as soon as the doors open at 10am (and cook lunch and dinner) and don't leave until they throw us out about 5:30pm. My children have such a great time in the water and playing on the swings, etc. If you don't feel like renting a table/bbq, you can bring a pic nic basket or order food from Rubys. Limited umbrellas are available for rent. Luau area is available for rent if your having a party; you can bbq or cater food.",JstShacaz
50,Great summer place for the kids,"If you have small kids, this is just the place for them. A part of the lagoon is very shallow for the little ones and the rest is for great for the older/experienced swimmers. There's a small playground that the kids seem to love. Bring a picnic (there are tables) and if you want, there's a walk up window to Ruby's diner for take out. Highly recommend.",Renae T
50,kids swim,"Good spot to take younger children, Summer camp here is the best and children love it.Fountains for children to play in, restaurants near by or bring your own lunch, drinks, snax. Sand play here is also good and safer than the beach as no waves.",Pele1210
50,Chll baby,Go here -take kids- put them in the water--play away. U relax-eat-sleep and just enjoy. The staff was nice and the area is kept as clean as can be considering the people. A Rubys diner walk up window is there and thats nice. Not bad.,Ben L
30,Family fun ...,Splash pool and rain heads make this a great place for young children to have fun and play safe in the water.,Sandi S
50,Excellent,"Really a paradise, here. Such a great place with the added bonus of some fine girls working there. Some good cocktails too.",Andrea Z
50,Great for little kids,sometimes little ones can be intimidated by the ocean waves. The lagoon is perfect for them. Plenty of things to play on. Little beach and water filtered from the nearby ocean. Area is pretty clean considering its right on the ocean,Judpma012
50,Vacation,"This was a very awesome place, my girls were so safe here, no big waves and no sharks, lol will definitely go again",mariagonzalez661
50,Great time with the Family,Great time with the Family. Clean and mellow vs. the beach. Fully enclosed safe environment with a lifeguard. Ruby's diner right next door.,Steve M
50,Wonderful fun,Perfect place to keep your kids safe and having fun. The water is a little cold but the kids enjoy it anyway.,elainems1978
30,GOOD PLACE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES,"I have no young children so have never used the beach facilities. However other events are held there, such as the Redondo Lobster Festival, hosted by the Redondo Beach Chamber of Commerce. That's a good opportunity to have lobster al fresco and listen to the band, dance or enjoy food from the many tent set ups. This is an annual affair held on Friday, Saturday and Sunday in September. The lagoon itself is a natural water pool that's shallow enough for children to play safely while the parents or sitters watch from the sand beach. It's usually pretty well used every day during the Summer. I frequent some of the restaurants that abut the lagoon, such as Ruby's and enjoy watching the children enjoy themselves.Recommended for those with younger children. Of course the Lobster Festival is more of an adult affair.",LHANN2013
50,What a fun place to go!,"Redondo Beach has this little hidden jewel called Seaside Lagoon! It is just awesome for families. The kids can play in the water, in the sand, have a nap and have picnics. If you go to Redondo Beach - do not forget to spend a day here!",VickiA63
50,Great family fun,Seaside Lagoon is a great place to take younger children. My wife and I used to take our kids there often. It is clean and safe.,Spanmann
50,"Great for kids! But also, great for any kind of event!","This place has everything, Check the calendar because there is always something going on here. But for everyday, its' a great place for kids, they will spend an entire day here. It's a great change from the beach.",Cucharina
30,I have come here since a kid in the 60s,"And brought my own little ones in the 90s. I will note a few things pro and con:PRO:- I love the addition of Rubys diner - you have access to a back window order station from within Seaside Lagoon and a special menu for the park (note: no salads available).- I like the newer tube slides instead of the old diving boards and vintage slide. They kept the old vintage fountain in the shallow part one one side - kind of retro feel and kids love the water spewing out and jumping off into the water.- I love the soft silky sand.- I like that you can have a fun water experience with both young and old and can relax a little without the worry of waves knocking down a little one.CON:- Biggest complaint - day camps - there were 7 large school busses in the parking lot - almost redirected ourselves to the beach but decided to give it a try - the place was overly packed with elementary age kids...I adore kids - BUT - camp counselors are not the same as parents in supervision. This created a jammed packed experience even in the shallow toddler areas of the lagoon, and if your toddler is a bit cautious like our granddaughter, she wanted to watch instead of play. Also, it is a safety concern. As we did go in the water with her - footballs, boogie boards, sand fights, water guns were all zinging over, in, on and through us in the shallow wading area. We dodged several. My suggestion is that management make one of the two shallow areas strictly baby and toddler swim areas. You may not have the waves of a beach to deal with, but instead you have a lot of wild running little bodies to contend with!When the buses started loading up at 2:00-2:30 the whole park calmed down and noise level lowered quite a bit. But then you only have about 2 hours left to enjoy it since the park closes at 4:45.- there are sharp rocks in the silky sand - all over near the waters edge and in the water too. All I can say is ""ouch"".- I don't think the water is warmed any more as I remembered it. It was very cold.- It gets a little pricey, $7 a head adults, $6 age 2 + especially when you include parking at $2 an hour and a crowded experience.",LuluGrace8
40,Great water park with a beach feel,What a great place to take young children for safe play and Ruby's diner is right there to go eat before your swim!,ronniwho
50,Great place for kids!,This place is nice. Lots of kids having birthday parties and enjoying the water. The water is well maintained and has a couple lifeguards. Paid I think 7 bucks to get in was nice to relax too.,Billytheeater
40,Great for Families,"This is a great alternative for families especially with smaller children than the beach/ocean. The kids play in the water with sand beaches, lifeguards are all around and there are no waves or undertow to watch for.The food is just ok and a little pricey.I attended a private ceremony wedding here after hours once and it was beautiful!",Kathi
40,A beach water park!,"Picnic areas, water toys all on sand with beach water, that is cleansed w/I believe chlorine since there a lot of kids there.",bowlbound
40,Great for Young Kids,"This is a great place to go with young kids, though the entry fee can be expensive when you have a lot of kids.It's clean, the lifeguards and employees are friendly, and the entire lagoon is enclosed in a fence so children cannot escape.The playground is a fun place to plant yourself and your guests, but with young kids, I prefer to be closer to the bathroom which are by the entry gate.BEWARE of the large openings under the platforms in the water where the fountains spout out. Small children can easily slip and get stuck there. I reported this, but on my last visit, nothing was done. For this reason, I dropped to a 4 out of 5 rating.",LivPurple
20,Unhealthy,Too many little ones running around throwing food. Water is mirky and has a zillion children in it. Adults leave food all over the benches and the seagulls come to get it. The seagulls poop on everything. It takes an hour to stand in line for food at Ruby's. Kids screaming and out of control. I like nothing about that place.,maggiemay502014
50,Safest beach area ever.,If you want a safe and clean beach area to take the kids the Seaside Lagoon is the place. It is a no smoking and no alcohol allowed section of beach that is enclosed and has several lifeguards on duty. There are also barbeque pits and it is a short walk from the pier.,K K
50,So nice and safe for toddlers to teens,Really enjoy the delicious food at Polly's on the Pier and at Ruby's Diner as well. The Redondo Pier is right next to the lagoon with lots of gift stores and Pedal Boats and Paddle Boards and lot's more,ODW2014
50,Awesome place to go to in the summer.,This is an excellent place to go to in the summer time. Nice lagoon to take the family of all ages. Gated to make sure kids don't go out of the attraction. plenty of space and also you can bbq there or take food for the day. we go every summer and always have an amazing time.,Roxfun
20,Not worth the money!,This place was a huge disappointment! First of all it was Very crowded and did not appear to have anyone enforcing any rules or regulations. I saw glass bottles everywhere. The lagoon was extremely cold and my kids (8 & 9 yrs old) complained that the enclosed slides were too small for them. Save your money & time....find a nice quite beach somewhere!!!,Tia B
40,Fun splashing around,"We didn't run around but enjoyed the location. This was s huge hit with kids, especially toddler to pre-teen.",JANEEN M
50,Great family place,"First time I visited this place was on 7/4. They have a special event every year. It is a great place to spend the day with the family. You buy tickets on line for sand or table seats. Some packages include parking.They open there doors at 2:00. You are not allowed to bring any food or drinks in. They have several activities to keep the kids busy. And after a day of swimming and eating they put on a great fireworks show. One thing I did not like was that they made a big deal about bringing in a canopy. I bought tickets on the sand so I brought with me a canopy for shade which they stated on line it was okay to do, but when we were coming in they said we could not bring it in. After some back and forth they said it was okay. We enjoyed the band, dj bbq dinner and the lagoon. What a great holiday.",dori90210
40,Great for kids,It's the best place to take kids in Redondo since the really isn't any other beaches within walking distance. They have cool slides and lifeguards on duty til closing. The prices are great too. Definitely worth going to.,biltri m
