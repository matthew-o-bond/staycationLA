50,Is it open to the public?,"I am not aware that this Green and Green house is open to the public.This Blacker House is considered the best example of Green and Green work besides the Gamble House. People bought it with the intention of stripping the interior. That was stopped part-way, and, I think, much was returned.It is located in a residential neighborhood. I don't think the neighbors will like carloads of tourists coming by. A Frank Lloyd Wright house is in the same block, other side of the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CASanMarino
