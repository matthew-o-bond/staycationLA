30,Stop in if you are in the area,"The free camera obscura is located on the second floor of the senior center along Palisades Park in Santa Monica. Ask the person at reception where to go - she will give you a two-page handout on the history of such cameras, how they work, etc. - and then enter the tiny dark room to see it in action. The ship's wheel turns the mirror a bit to change the view (be gentle!). We spent about 10-15 minutes in total. If you need a restroom, public ones are on the left side of the building.",CleopatraBunny
30,Hidden history,This periscope hidden in the middle of the hustle of Santa Monica is like a piece of another time. It’s fun to check out the surrounding beach and people watch.,ajdial
50,Interesting and free,The camera Obscura is a historic camera and unlike anything we had seen before. If you’re in Santa Monica it’s worth a visit and is also free,jaynic
50,Magic Eye,This is a fun attraction with a cool view. Must see! Old School way of looking at things. Highly recommended!,LaurieStory
50,Unexpected Jewel on Santa Monica bluffs,"This is a great piece of Los Angeles history. Been there over 100 years. At the end of Santa Monica Bl where it meets the bluff. Inside the non assuming Senior Center, go upstairs to small dark room and look through the camera obscura. Like a periscope you can see 360 degrees. It's pretty cool, great for kids, doesn't take a lot of time out of your plans, and it's FREE. Hardly ever crowded, but if it is just wait, it only takes 10-15 minutes to experience it. Overlooked by most, which is good because it remains somewhat a secret, but enjoyed by all who take the time.",kimo213
30,If you have nothing else to do...,"Camera Obscura has been here since 1898 and I figured it was time to see it. Free to visit, you walk upstairs and into a darkened room. Here you see an imaged projected from a mirror that is mounted on the roof of the building. You can see 360 degrees from around you. It's kinda interesting and all, but 10 minutes later and you're done. Glad to see it, but don't make a special trip. If you're in Santa Monica, great. Otherwise, eh.",jtlerman
40,If you are on the Palisades take a gander,If you are on the Palisades Park take a gander. Not worth a special trip. But it remains part of the charm and history of Santa Monica. It is close to the Third Street And Santa Monica Place.,Cavydad
40,Camera at Senior Center on Ocean,It's worth a visit to see the unusual lens & view of the beach. Check out the limited hours due to renovations on Ocean Avenue.,SMOgal
30,Super cool and free,Located in a kiosk on the edge of the bluff above Santa Monica pier in a community building. Go inside and ask the person at desk to see the camera and you will be directed to a tower in the center of the building. Climb the stairs and see a cool functional exhibit of camera obscura. You can rotate the view with a periscope projected onto a tilting light table in the center of the room. You will feel like a scientist! Albeit a 16th century one...and did I mention it is free? Kids would love it.,ChrisfromRoanokeVA
50,"I remember seeing something like this in Italy, in one of the old villas","I had walked by this senior center so many times I forgot to wonder what it actually was. So one day I decided to go in. WOW, it brought back memories of when I was touring Italy and saw this ""Camera Obscura"" in a room of the Villa Vicio just outside of Rome. When you go in, you just show your ID, sign in, get the key, go up the stairs and enter a VERY dark room. There is a large steering wheel that you turn and you can see Santa Monica projected on the flat surface. You are inside a very large camera and it is an interesting experience..",David_DeMulle
