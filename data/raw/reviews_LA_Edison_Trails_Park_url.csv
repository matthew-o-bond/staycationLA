40,Half mile hike in the Repetto Hills of Monterey Park,"This is a park that extends eastward from Garfield Avenue to Fulton Avenue in Monterey Park in the Repetto Hills. The park essentially is below the Southern California Edison power transmission lines that run to the SCE substation to the west. There is a hiking trail that runs along the length of the park. There is some elevation gain, but the slope is not too severe. The trail is not paved, but is compacted soil that is very easy to traverse if not wet. The park does have homes on either side of it, but is a nice half-mile hike one way or one mile round trip. It is a nice green space that is not spoiled with development within its boundaries, although there is a children's play area on the westernmost parcel of the park near Garfield Avenue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,Good for exercise and short hiking in Monterey Park city with great view,"We love to walk through the trail everyday when have time since it is very close to our house and enjoys the view in Monterey Park city. Recently, our city has sent a construction group to replace the old entry fences and cut the dried grasses along the trail making it more cleaning than before. However, i wish the walkers with dogs have more responsible to clean the dog's poop when they use the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Frankthu
20,Not for Hiking,"Edison Trail starts east of Edison Trails Park, which sits along South Garfield Avenue. It spans four blocks eastward and ends at Fulton Avenue, just before La Loma Park. This trail is not for hiking.This hike was basically walking through the backyards of neighboring homes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orcaandbeluga
