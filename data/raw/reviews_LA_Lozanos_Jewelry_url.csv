50,Couldn't have asked for a better partner in choosing an engagement ring,"I spent 3 months looking for an engagement ring for my now fiancee and I was so happy to have chosen Lozano's jewelry. From the moment I first walked into the store, Armando made it clear that he was going to partner with me in helping me find the perfect ring. I went to 12 other jewelers, most of whom wanted to sell me something they already had or put pressure on me to commit before leaving the store, neither of which Armando did.I ended up going to Lozano's jewelry 4 times. Armando was generous enough to order a few settings online and have them delivered to his store. One of the most powerful moments for me at Lozano's was one when of the settings I wanted arrived. Despite the fact that I loved it online and asked Armando to order it, I didn't like how it looked in person. It took Armando one glance at my face to know I didn't want it. He didn't spend one second of time convincing me to buy it. He said you don't like it, don't buy it, this is an important decision. I will send it back. He then helped me find a setting and ring that I absolutely fell in love with, and then he had it resized and customized (changing the head from princess to round diamond) for me in record time. My fiancee absolutely adored it, said yes on the spot, and has spent much of the last week flaunting it to all of her friends and family. I came out looking like a king. I would highly, highly recommend Lozano's to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R3098QNmichaels
50,Friendly & honest,"Great local custom jeweler. Very friendly service, never pushy and always willing to make a good deal. Weâ€™ve made 2 custom rings here and Armando was very patient with our decision-making process. Custom orders are hand-carried by Lozano himself to his craftsman in LA. (We we were thrilled to accompany him on a couple visits). His team also throws fun seasonal parties in the shop so ask about the next one. Thanks again you guys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amarquette
