50,We went to see the special exhibit of artist Oscar Oiwa,"We went to see the special exhibit of artist Oscar Oiwa called Dreams of a Sleeping World, Very unusual installation with the art done in black and white inside a plastic bubble that you walk into - unique to say the least. My wife and I have been several times but not in the past ten years as we moved up to central California. We did walk through the permanent exhibits which are small but very well done. We didn't know it was bought by USC about 8 years ago.",Chuck113
50,Special Exhibits are Wonderful!,"I was there for an unveiling of a special exhibit of artist Oscar Oiwa whose work surprised me with his contemporary: Dreams of a Sleeping World, A fun interesting work that I was not expecting to see in a typical Asian museum.Don't miss the exhibit if you have a chance. The museum has a beautiful courtyard and the exhibit downstairs ar wonderful explaining the different dynasties of Asian history plus the museum is not just Chinese exhibits.",chrisinpasadena

30,"Large in Breadth, Small in Depth","This museum attempts to cover Asian and southeast Asian art and artifacts - quite a daunting scope and breadth. But, its collection is quite small. So, you get just the tip of the iceberg in each of its Ceramics, Silk, East Asian Art, Himalayan Art, South and Southeast Asian Art, and Pacific Islands Art exhibits. There's quite a large area dedicated to temporary exhibitions - Contemporary Asian Art was on display when I visited. Nevertheless, for what it lacks in depth, it compensates in quality. Many of the pieces presented are quite extraordinary. I especially enjoyed the ceramics exhibit which includes a video demonstrating construction technique.The free parking onsite is a bonus. And, the compact nature of the collection - it's only one floor - means that most people can see everything and still spend a moment enjoying the lovely courtyard with no more than an hour, perhaps two hours if you linger and read every single placard.",JDBonthemove

And they have free parking, a rarity in Pasadena.",Townley C

The courtyard also has artifacts and a koy pond and is a great place for a picnic. My wife and I spent two hours here and enjoyed our visit. Keep in mind that this is a small museum and yes the museum has free parking. Also note that the museum doesn't open until 11am.,jerryanddiane

The museum will hold off-site exhibits during this time.In anticipation, I visited in late May. The museum is in a quadrangle layout, starting at the admissions and continuing to the gift shop - it's hard to get lost.

It started in the Ringling Museum I think in Florida, and there is a beautiful, well put together book on the exhibit. Lots of maps and information. There is also a smaller exhibit with a room each from China, Japan and Korea. The building itself has history and is interesting and the edhibits are all on one floor, so easy to see. It was interesting and a good use of a couple of hours in Pasadena.",Douglas T

In an admittedly hurried visit I didn't find much to keep me entranced or willing to come back though the building itself, with a shaded interior courtyard, is probably worth a stop. The exhibit of Ikko Tanaka's graphic art was also an eye-opener for those interested in how Japanese artists have incorporated art into commercial logos. I'd hoped for more and better.",Taughboyne

The museum is easy to navigate, and manageable in size so that it is suitable for families with children and those adults, myself included, who were not born with the ""I-like-to-spend-all-day-in-a-museum"" gene.All-in-all, a good value for the price of admission.",hamvestor

40,Interesting blend of historical and contemporary Asian art,"I first heard about the Pacific Asia Museum from an associate who lives in Ventura, California. He mentioned it when we visited the Huntington Library and Gardens in Pasadena and I immediately added it to my must photograph list. As it turned out this year I had business in Los Angeles once again so scheduled a day to visit the museum.I rented a car when I got to LAX and drove to the museum in about 45 minutes following my iPhone's turn-by-turn directions. There is a parking lot adjacent to the museum and there were still several spaces vacant. I arrived just before lunch so asked the receptionist if there was a cafe nearby where I could grab something to eat before I began exploring the galleries. She recommended a little cafe just a block away so it didn't take long to walk there, eat and return to the museum.The museum's collection encompasses 15,000 objects that span more than 4000 years and has representative items in galleries spaced around a central courtyard. All of the galleries are on the ground floor so there is no need to negotiate stairs.I had three hours to explore the museum before I had to leave for a reception in Ventura so decided to focus on the sculptures, ceramics and religious art. The museum also has one of the largest collections of Otsu-e folk paintings outside of Japan but I simply didn't have time to look through them.I began my visit in the galleries on the right side of the courtyard. These galleries contained Chinese, Korean and Japanese ceramics, jade items and decorator arts. One particularly interesting object was one of the few remaining examples of a late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE) folding horseshoe-shaped chair.In the galleries to the left of the courtyard I found a variety of objects from Nepal, Tibet, Pakistan, India, southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. There was a wide assortment of very well preserved Buddhist and Hindu religious figures as well as colorfully painted carved wood Hindu deities from Bali.In addition to the historical art on display, the museum was also exhibiting some modern work by Asian artists. I wandered through a fascinating collection of hanging metalwork by Israel-based artist Penny Hes Yassour. It was like walking through a three dimensional Chinese ink painting. I was also stunned by the dramatic portraits of Asian women who found their way to the American West painted by Chinese-born American contemporary artist Hung Liu.With such a variety of artwork to enjoy, my time rapidly ran out so I made my way back to the museum's very well stocked gift shop. I asked the customer service person who I should ask to open the ironwork gate so I could leave the parking lot and she gave me a token to put in the coin slot of the automatic gate opener. This is important to remember as once you enter the museum's parking lot, a directional spike strip prevents you from leaving the way you entered.Although the museum was smaller than a number of other Asian museums I have visited, I thought it had an interesting blend of historical and contemporary Asian art and was well worth the time I spent there.",mharrsch

Tickets are $10 for Adults, $7 for Students and Seniors, free for children 11 years and under.This museum is in dire need of an upgrade. The exhibit rooms are small, the artifacts themselves are mostly very small, not optimally displayed, simply encased in acrylic cases. Ancient scrolls and ornate garments are hung behind acrylic plates which reflects light and distort vision. The poorly designed lighting casts such unflattering shadows on prized artifacts. The Harari collection was nice.The small gift shop however, was bountiful with exquisite merchandise. They know how to display to appeal to traffic flow. The lighting there was warm and welcoming.",3Kells

There wasn't much variety, it seemed like we were looking at similar types of artifacts in every room.There was free parking in an open uncovered lot next to the building. The gift shop had a lot of merchandise but nothing that was practical as a souvenir from this place. I ended up buying just a little note-pad and 2 little charms that had no connection to the museum. It's a great place if you're REALLY in to Asian art and need to kill a couple of hours.",Pepeau

I think this place would offer a beautiful and intimate wedding ceremony and reception by the way.But anyways, I liked some of the special displayed paintings featured in the main part of the museum. I also liked learning some additional history and religious practices about Asia.But was a bit disappointed that this place seems to be a bit small and was hoping it would be bigger.The library section is very small and my husband and I felt quite strange walking into it to browse as there was only one woman in there and it was dead silent in there (yes I realize it is a library, but still, I didn't feel quite welcomed).Overall, it was nice to spend a late afternoon with my husband walking around for an hour or so and check out the grounds.",meowmix318

It's like a magic box.There is a definite recognition that Asian art is not just Japanese or Chinese, but a full spectrum. The orientation sets that up by teaching a bit of geography and history. Then there are rooms of artifacts. Finally, in the last section, there are videos on pottery production and older displays chronicling the history of Asia and its communications with the ""West."" It is an outstanding two hours, or longer, depending on how interested you are. The level of detail entices you to spend more time.",Marc S

40,Worth a visit,"We were lucky and visited when it was open to the public for free. The collections give an overall look at the various cultures and religions of the pacific. It was very interesting and informative, describing how the art has been changed over time by both secular and religious influences. My wife had hoped for a larger collection of Japanese art, including kimonos and would have liked to see more on display.",Gareth H
40,Pacific Asia Museum - worth a stop to visit,Lovely Asian influenced house with exhibits and a nice gift shop. We visited on weekend and got lucky - it was free thanks to a sponsor activity day.,highlandbride
40,"Small, intimate introduction to Asian Art","Really quite a nice, very small museum, which will give you a good overview of the Arts of Asia. The building itself is interesting and charming. Parking is difficult but if you go on a Sunday there is no particular problem.This is a very good way to familiarize yourself with the panorama of Asian Art not a lot of depth but a good overview. At times they have temporary exhibits that are worth seeing.",Ted C
50,"Nice, small museum devoted to asia","This is a nice small museum in a house built in Chinese style by a collector, who donated her house and collection to the city. Since that donation, additional artifacts have been added. There are artifacts from India, China, Nepal, Tibet, New Guinea, Thailand, Korea, Japan, etc. There are lots of Buddha statues and statues of Indian gods (some very old). Right now there is an exhibit of kimonos and one of Asian gardens (mainly in drawings, etc.). There is a free parking lot next door. When you pay to get in, ask for a token to let you out the parking lot gate. The entrance price is $9 for adults, $7 for students and seniors, children under 12 are free. At the end of the museum, there is a gift shop. It is well worth a visit.",ANNIE S
50,Second time visiting,"This is a beautiful albeit intimate museum with a lovely collection, great gift shop and a peaceful courtyard with koi. A nice collection of Indian, Chinese, Korean and Japanese work with pieces from additional Pacific-rim countries.",historiclondontown
50,Visit Asia without leaving Pasadena,"The Los Angeles area has hundreds of museums, but only one dedicated to the whole of Asian art. The building is in a square configuration with an attractive courtyard at the center and a series of connected galleries circling it. As the visitor proceeds through the galleries, he or she passes through art from different parts of Asia. About midway is a small side gallery of pottery. There is usually a temporary exhibit or two. The gift shop caries a variety of related merchandise. Plan an hour or two. The museum also offers numerous programs.The museum is only about a block off Colorado Boulevard near Old Pasadena. Be sure to get a token before leaving the museum for the exit gate to the parking lot.",Kenneth L
50,Nice,"It is a very neat, but small, museum. I was there with my young daughters. The courtyard is beautiful. They loved it.",Miguel Mary
50,Superb collection of Asian art with specialized exhibits.,"Includes art and artifacts from all ages. We were able to see ancient to modern Asian art, including a major display of Japanese wood prints (2 rooms). Photography (no flash) is allowed. The art is well displayed and accessible. Put this on your list.",dagda2
50,Highly recommended Asian & India artwork,"Hours:Wed-Sun 10 am - 6 pmWe loved this museum. My daughter has a BFA degree & is a new High School Art teacher so we have been taking time to tour all art museums in So Cal. This was on our weekend agenda & it was very informative. She was my private tour guide. Highly recommended if you like art or Asian art. Also, you can walk next door afterward & tour the Pasadena Museum of CA Art. You can go to either one first & then take your receipt to the other one & you get in for half price. The central courtyard with the Koi pond was a restful mini-break as well at the Asian museum after we had toured all the exhibits. The building is a historical monument and the plaque on the front of the building has the details. As mentioned by others it was a private home in Asian style & is very authentic. They do have an exhibit toward the end of the tour that explains travel & trade on The Silk Road across Europe & there is a child's dress up area, large stuffed camel, etc. But the rest of the museum would probably bore most children as it is a lot of the same type of exhibits, is dimly lit, and just not conducive to most kids having the patience to tour it. It is great for adults though, or anyone, like teens who appreciate or want to learn more about Asian & India art",Nancy W
50,Well done in educational and artistic aspects.,"The museum is arranged in a series of walk through rooms around a central courtyard, where activities also take place. We love Asian art in general, and learned a great deal about the different cultures within that very large grouping. Most of the art was very well displayed and explained, and the special exhibits were so stunning that eventually we had to give up because we got ""arted"" out!",Carol B
50,unique,"This museum is special; has wonderful Asian art pieces from a private collection; the house itself is a gem too. Anybody who is in Pasadena at one time should want to visit it with Pasadena's other, many attractions.",Judith I
40,"Nice, small museum",If you are interested in Asian and Buddhist Art. This is a nice small museum with a good collection.,hansgeluk
50,THE NAME SAYS IT,Lots of beautiful and interesting exhibits. It's great t have such a fine museum so close,BETTY S
30,A pleasant small collection of asian art,"I had some time to kill between meetings in the area, so I decided to check this museum out. It seems like a great place to spend about one hour. They have a very calm courtyard. The Chinese, Indian, Tibetan, Korean and Japanese collections comprise about one room each, and they do a good job with those collections. The Papua New Guinea room has only three pieces. There are other random pieces from Vietnam and Thailand, and maybe Indonesia. I don't recall seeing anything at all about the Philippines, or Malaysia, or Burma. Well maybe they had something about Burma or Cambodia.In any case, it's a pleasant hour or so wandering, but hardly worth planning a trip there if you have other things to do no in that area.",mountaindolphin
40,Nice collection,"Small but interesting collection from Asia and India, housed in a quirky Chinese-style old house in Old Pasadena.Excellent gift shop.",gail r
50,Very nice museum for a quick overview of...,Very nice museum for a quick overview of Asian historical artifacts. Tip: Free on every 4th Friday of the month.,uin
30,Note to museum: Replace angry lady,"There is one woman who works here, that needs to find another job. The museum would really do well to show her the door. Truly she belongs in the unemployment line... in Siberia. Very unfriendly, unwelcoming, rude and loud.The rest of the staff seemed very nice. Of course anyone would seem nice compared to this spiteful individual.If I were you, I would call in advance and ask if the yelling lady is still employed at this museum before visiting. This person definitely made our trip less pleasant.The museum itself is home to some very interesting objects, including a ""cheat sheet"" written on silk cloth, which dates back at least a hundred years. Next to almost every piece is an insightful tidbit, providing good information.The building the museum is in, is itself a museum-worthy piece. Wonderful architecture, with interesting natural lighting.",greatestdog
50,An Asian Gem in Pasadena,"This is a jewel of a museum in the converted Chinese style home of Grace Nicholson who lived in Pasadena in the early 20th c. The collections are esp. strong in Chinese ceramics, Jade, and Tibetan art. The galleries surround a traditional Chinese courtyard with a koi pool.Many education programs, docent tours available, gift shop with interesting items.A visit to this museum is enlightening, revitalizing, and a fine way to spend an afternoon.",jafb
