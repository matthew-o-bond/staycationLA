50,Beautiful trail to Santa Ynez Falls,"Santa Ynez Falls trail begin at a site of an old limestone quarry from which Quarry Canyon is named. It lies within Topanga State Park located in the Santa Monica Mountains. We set out on the hike on a hot summer day, very lightly dressed and not exactly prepared for the poison oak warnings. Luckily neither of us got stung despite poison oak being at peak potency in the summer. The trail is lined with big trees providing welcome shade and cooler temperatures. On the way up we saw a black and yellow striped garter snake, a lounge of lizards, hummingbirds, butterflies, beautiful beetles and wild fennel 7-8’ tall. This is a beautiful tranquil trail and your senses really open up to the sounds and sights of the surrounding flora and fauna. I can only imagine what it’s like in the fall when the water starts falling and the rivers flowing. One thing to note: there are a few unmarked forks and with no cellular reception in the canyon we were not sure which way would lead us to the falls. Luckily there were other hikers out that could show us the way. Printed maps are the way to go. The hike is 8 miles round trip, about 1000’ net elevation and took us about 1 hour and change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnossDesign
