40,Fun and Educational Day!,"This faire is so interesting, so much to see and learn... loved the costumes! People try to get into the spirit of the Renaissance time... queen and court walking by, performances, parades, fun shopping... it can get hot and dusty... bring water. Food is pricey, nothing under $6. Food is good and tasty. Many families dressed the part... babies, toddlers, grandparents, etc... lots of couples and friends having a good time. We didn't see anyone out of control even though they served alcohol.We had a great time!",4Travelling
