50,Will use them again!,Captain Eric and First Mate Sherri were very accommodating and we had a great time on the morning Dolphin cruise. We enjoyed the boat ride and saw pods of dolphins swimming and jumping all around our boat. We really appreciated the pictures that Captain Eric took of our excursion. We highly recommend using Samadhi Adventures!,tropicalbreeze77
50,Great morning on the ocean!!,Captain Eric did a great job scheduling my wife and I for a morning cruise of dolphin watching where we saw HUNDREDS of dolphins. Great host and boat. Highly recommend!,John B
50,This the best way to see whales and dolphins!,"My wife and I had a fantastic time taking a whale watching trip with Captain Eric and his First Mate Sherri. Within minutes of leaving King Harbor Eric found a huge pod of dolphins for us. He skillfully maneuvered the boat so we were almost part of the pod with dolphins swimming and leaping within feet of the boat. After a while Eric spotted a whale on the horizon (he has radars for eyes). We caught up with the whale and followed along (at a close, but safe distance) for over an hour watching him surface and spout countless times . He even lifted his enormous tail a couple of times for us! The trip was a total success.This is the second time we have gone whale watching. The first time was on one of the large whale watching boats that operate out of San Pedro. We hated that trip. Here are some things to consider and why you should make the trip with Captain Eric:• The large boats: over-crowded. Captain Eric: never takes more than 2-6 people at a time.• The large boats: announcements are made over a crappy loudspeaker system. Captain Eric talks directly to his guests – and has conversations!• The large boats: little information is conveyed to the large crowd of people. Captain Eric is always offering interesting information on the bay, animals and the area’s history.• The large boats: not maneuverable. Captain Eric’s boat is small and maneuverable so he can get up and close to nature without impacting it.• The large boats: they do not take “requests”. Eric will show you what you want to see, when you want to see it. Seen enough? He’ll show you something else you are interested in. You control the day.• The large boats: you will not even know who the captain is. Captain Eric will make this feel like an outing with good, lifelong friends.Bottom line: This is without a doubt the only way to successfully and comfortably see the aquatic life out of LA.",Mark H
50,"""Call of the Wild""",We couldn't have asked for better hosts to take us back to the early days of this great coastline. From the fresh sage to the Chumash chants our hosts treated us with a wealth of knowledge and enlightenment. Highly recommend a tour with Samadhi Adventures!!,Jeff B
50,Valentines Day Tour !,"Captain Eric and his ship mate Sheri greeted us with pastries, fruit and mimosas as we first blessed our tour with a Chumash (Early California Indians) chant. The whole idea of this tour/adventure was to experience “Samadhi” which according to Captain Eric, is ancient word describing intense mindfulness; that’s what we’re supposed to do, to be totally mindful of our experience. As we drove out of King Harbor Cpt. Eric gave us a thorough explanation of the various animals we would see and boy did we see them… a barge full of sea lions ! dozens and dozens of them sleeping! Try clapping your hands and watch them look up! Then we journeyed out to see dolphins swimming right off our bow, right there, like you could just touch them… be sure to bring a camera!! Then the illusive hunt for whales. And we got lucky!! Found one and followed it for about 20 minutes!! Be ready because the go under the water for 5 minutes at a time. We saw twice it’s huge tail above water before the deep dive!It’s a smaller boat (25 feet) that will take 4-6 guests…. Not more. Eric and Sheri were super cool. Highly recommend this if you’re wanting NOT to be on a big cattle boat with tons of tourists. This is intimate and close and very very cool. The whole boat is yours.",sparkford
50,Fabulous time!!!,"Went out on a wonderful boat trip last Sunday. Captain Eric is a knowledgable, and a great Captain. We saw Dolphins, whales and lots of seals/ sea lions. It was also a great way to see Los Angeles from a different view. I forgot "" all that is going on at home"" and lived "" in the moment"" for an afternoon. What fun!!!! Highly recommend this to locals as well as non-locals.",Eva_Yancey
50,We're going again!,"It was fantastic. They know everything about the sea, the environment - they'll answer all your questions - AND you'll run with the dolphins.",Nick T
50,"Ocean Swim, Surf, Dolphins!!!","I've been out with Eric for 3 different and incredible Adventures!!! My first was learning how to Ocean Swim, which could be a bit scary, but Eric was so great and relaxed watching over me, teaching me the basics, and helping me so safe and comfortable in the Ocean. Our next Adventure was learning how to Surf!!! Eric taught me what to look for, how the water breaks, the wind direction, and how safely to catch a wave and ride!!! Our most recent Samadhi Adventure was on His boat to Catalina. I have never been so up close to Dolphins like i was on that Adventure. It seemed like hundreds of them flying in and out of the water all around the boat, incredible. To top it off, we then saw a Whale Breach the water which I thought only happened movies. Definitely a memory of a lifetime!!! All these amazing experiences I never would have had without Eric and his Samadhi Adventures.",michael w
50,Up Close and Personal w/ Dolphins!,"My husband and I and our dog (yes! it's a dog friendly boat!) did the morning cruise w/ Captn Eric and we had a blast! A huge school of dolphins came up and followed the boat and played w/ the boat. They were so close that it almost felt like we could reach out and touch them. Captn Eric knew just how to maneuver the boat to keep the dolphins coming back. It was just incredible. Our dog, who had never been on a boat before, seemed sea sick at first but then as soon as he saw the dolphins coming up close, he perked right up and was just mesmerized.It's not a large boat but it was very well kept, efficient, and the captain was very personal and accommodating. I liked the fact that it wasn't one of those huge commercial boats that go out w/ a ton of people packed in like sardines. Because we were in a small boat, we received lots of personal attention and the best part was that we really felt like we were sailing right w/ the dolphins because we were down lower than you could be on a big boat.",Kathy k
