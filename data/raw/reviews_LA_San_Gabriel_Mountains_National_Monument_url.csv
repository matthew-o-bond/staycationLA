50,"Extreme hiking, camping and exploring","Extreme hiking, camping and exploring in the San Gabriel mountains. It is still possible to climb mountain peaks and ford streams and even occasionally see a bear. More likely squirrels and deer. Awesome places to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad

50,Hiking! Views! New National Monument 2014,"2014 San Gabriel Mountains became a US National Monument. Since the 1880's people from Los Angeles, Pasadena & all local communities have visited for the opportunity to be outdoors. I am a frequent visitor driving up Azusa Canyon to see the views, hike, and just find a quiet place to see the view of the San Gabriel Valley. Crystal Lake is a good destination for a day drive. A turn onto East Fork just past Morris Dam will take you to Glendora Mountain Road for another great drive. So many places to go, camp, hike, so check with the US Forest Service for more information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendoratraveller
50,Stellar views,"Thankfully this area was preserved and protected recently. This range is one site you never forget. Especially after the rain, when in the winter snow covers the peaks. Love Mt. Baldy, but can't wait to get up to the nearby Observatory, beyond the park trails we all know and love down below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffMateas
