30,Fun but pricey,"The walk through the ranch is enjoyable, with countless plastic carved pumpkins showing great creativity. At $27 each for adults$22 for kids though, plus $10 parking, it adds up really quick. Two (small) drinks at the spookeasy ran us $30 with tip so it proved to be a pricey night for a stroll through Halloween decor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjlpt
50,Fun time for entire family,"Nights of the Jack is a Festival of Lights during the Halloween season and is open every Friday Saturday and Sunday. First walk is available at 630pm and they go by 30 minute intervals up until 10pm I believe. They have an activity zone before the trail where you can buy food from trendy food trucks and buy coffee wine cider etc.. lots of fun activities and you can watch pumpkin carving. They have self parking and valet parking as well. It’s a self guided tour of 1/2 mile and you can go at your own pace and take in all the sites. If I’m Calabasas during the Halloween season, this is a must see. It’s only open a short time I believe thru the 1st week of November.
