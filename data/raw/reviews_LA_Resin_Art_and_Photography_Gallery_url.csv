50,Great Gallery with Better Talent!,"Whether you are just visiting South Bay or are a local, this gallery is a hidden gem. Inside is the work of 20-30 working, contemporary artists in a variety of media. Paintings, photography, sculpture, even a body painter! Definitely worth checking out. Bonus: In a town with super limited parking, this gallery has its own lot, so parking is stress-free and, even better, ACTUALLY free! It's super family-friendly, and handicap accessible. Several of the artists work out of the building, so there is a good chance you will get to meet some of them in person. Don't miss it!",emilybrantley
50,The best gallery in South Bay,"The gallery is always featuring at least 25 artists and over 75 pieces. The work spans from photography to fine art, from oil to mix media, to street art inspired to drone photography. And the curation is fluid so that there is continuity throughout the artists and their work. Totally family (and dog) friendly. The space has a relatable / cool / hip feel, and isn't pretentious. While still having world class art.",mixmaster906
