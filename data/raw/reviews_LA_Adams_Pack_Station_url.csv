40,Historic Station at Good Hiking Spot,"The pack station is reportedly the last of its kind in the US. Donkeys for rent here take supplies to the cabins located up the canyon from the Chantry Flats area. The station has food, drink, and some basic supplies for cabin-dwellers and hikers. The donkeys are on site, in a pen behind an out building. The pack station is located adjacent to the National Park Service parking lot at Chantry Flats-an Adventure Pass or National Park Pass is required in the Park Service lot, but for a slightly larger fee you can park in the station lot. The hiking is good but the main trail starts down a long, steep road (easy out but a grind back up).This is an interesting spot to see a remnant of history and provides a nice service for cabin dwellers and thirsty hikers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bverbos
