50,Nature,A wonderful place to get away and feel Mother Nature away from the hustle and bustle. Gorgeous view of the Pacific Ocean. A rewarding hiking trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
50,Beautiful,So raw and beautiful. It was the epitome of serene. It seems impossible to have a bad day while being a part of this pristine environment. The only downside is the traffic both motorized and bicycles. Both of whom are super rude and inconsiderate of anyone else in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelasD4179MW
20,This place stinks,The place looks good from afar but it’s far from good. The stench of rotting sea lion corpses is not pleasant but one can at least understand and accept it as natures way. Sorry to say that up close you will find stinky piles of human feces here and there right above the waterline - gross! Better bets are Cabrillo beach to the south and Torrance beach to the north...More restrooms and they pick up any dead marine life that floats in on the tide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/552ChuckN
10,So disappointing,"I had been looking forward to enjoying a day at the beach after working 18 straight days. I show up with my service dog, because he goes everywhere with me. The lifeguard comes up and says I need to leave. I say he's a service dog and I'd gladly show him my papers. He says ""I know you're lying and people like you ruin it for everyone else, but whatever.""He walked away leaving me absolutely shocked that somone who doesn't even know me would say that. I walked a bit down the beach where there was absolutely no one else on the around. My dog and i were playing fetch because he deserves to enjoy the beach too and its a great time for him to get some energy out. The liefeguard then walks all the way down to where I am, just to come yell at me again. Saying ""Its disgusting that you would do this. You're a liar. He needs to be on a leash if he's a service dog."" I again tell him i can show him my papers and he threatens to call the police on me! All i could do is say that i would show them his papers too!Having a service dog is supposed to make my life easier. He is registered as a service dog, I carry around his papers, and I am treated like a criminal for trying to enjoy my day. I will never be coming back here. Its a shame because it was an absolutely beautiful beach. We ended up leaving to avoid getting harrassed again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mangogenga
50,Wow!,Beautiful drive and walk. Cliffs and beach are lovely. Even a little shade and some picnic tables to have lunch!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammyf
40,Fantastic Views,"We drove along the Pacific Coast Highway from Redondo and decided to travel up to Palos Verdes to see if we could drive to the top of the cliff. Sure enough, it took a little while, but driving along the road closest to the ""water"" gave us fantastic views. There's even some places along the way to stop and take photos and take in the breathtaking views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingParent1
50,Beautiful view,This scenic route is worth a drive. Beautiful beach and gorgeous sunset view . Park and hike the trails around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/761tss
50,One of the most beautiful places in Southern California.,I live in the neighborhood and drive by this every day. It never gets old. Probably one of the most beautiful places in Southern California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/n8080
50,Bring a camera!,"If you're up for some short hiking trails and beautiful scenery as well as awesome tidal pools to see crabs, urchins and sea anemones then by all means check this place out.... some of the trails are steep but the 2 1/2 year old did well walking most of it.... definitely keep an eye on your littles if you bring them ..... but this place was cool... enjoy!Oh if you're a photography buff like I am.... bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626cliffw
40,"So close to a metropolis, yet so peaceful","A dramatic coastal strip, take a walk, feel the breeze from the Pacific Ocean. But do not come here to find a place for swimming. Drive along the coastal road and view large villas and properties",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,"aka Abalone Cove, great hiking and viewing",This is an excellent area for short hikes with a bit of vertical and very picturesque vistas and shoreline. There are often dolphins and other fish in the cove. Stunningly beautiful; one of my favorite places for a weekday respite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrg_LB
40,Palos Verdes Coast,Wonderful scenery and easily accessible. Plenty of parking available for your convenience. There are several trails available for short hikes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffsV7798VJ
40,Beautiful hike for strong walkers,"We entered via the Trump Golf Club, walked along the rocky shore to Shoreline Park (per map). We enjoyed the tide pools, though I recommend checking the tide to make sure it's low tide so you can discover more ocean surprises.It took our group three hours to get back to our car at Trump's parking lot. The walk back is mostly uphill, then it gets easier once you get to the top of the RR tie steps.Be warned! Sometimes the bridge is closed, and there is no warning on the Shoreline Park end.Bring water, apply sunscreen, wear a hat/visor, wear closed-toe shoes, and bring a camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
50,Lovely place,"a wonderful place to visit with family,kids,friends especially now with the lego art displays. The only negative was that the lake has no water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/outdoorsy73
50,Beautiful hiking area,"This is one of my favorite areas for walking or exercising with a great view. There are many paved trails and gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. If you go there is the spring or fall, bring binoculars and visit the visitor's center at Point Vicente to see all the different whales (grey, blues) and dolphins. This is a great place for children of all ages and the trails are wide enough for strollers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439kents
