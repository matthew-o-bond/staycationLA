10,Cancelling Tours,"I have emailed several times and left several voice mails regarding the tour that was booked for today, requesting a refund. You appear to be open, but ignore requests for refunds due to the current situation. Not leaving a very positive view of your company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G5552BGjohnw
50,"More like a very cool amusement park ride, with generous pours - not a boring distillery tour!","Loved the tour, unlike any other tour on which we’ve been. The first part was pretty standard fare, but as soon as we boarded the first bus we knew we were in for a treat. The rest defies description, but suffice to say it’s kind of like a very creative amusement park ride with generous pours... Very personable, very knowledgeable guides, and Aaron in particular was hilarious. Will recommend to friends and will likely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weeklytraveler2
40,Something different to do!,"We were not sure what to expect and we did have an overall good time, but I would never do it again and I don't think I can recommend this very highly unless you love strong whiskey or rum or are fascinated with the distilling process. It was a quirky experience, put on and run by a lovely group of young entrepreneurs who seemingly love what they do. But it is rough around the edges and could be improved in many ways. It starts out in a promising fashion but from the reviews, I thought the majority of the tour would be in a boat. Instead, you are only on the boat for a few minutes and then they put you on a bus for 20 minutes to take you to the actual distillery and then you have to drive back on another bus. True they have the buses decorated in an unusual fashion and offer you a taste while traveling but it is bumpy and noisy and not that comfortable or easy to hear the ""tour guide"". The tastings themselves were a big disappointment to me and my family since the first liquor is quite disgusting and so smokey tasting that the scent never left my glass even after rinsing it out. You are then stuck with your glass for the other 3 tastings but all you can smell is the smoke from the first one. Bad planning. I don't want to say too much because part of the enjoyment of the experience came from not really knowing what to expect - just keep your expectations low and you can still have a good time - recommend going with a few friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadler
20,"Fun tour BUT, don't buy any liquor!!","My wife and I went on this tour with our son while we were visiting him in LA. It's very expensive for what it is but, we were on vacation. The tour itself is funky, fun and entertaining. WARNING, as other reviews said, DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE WITH YOU!! We bought some bottles that were not available yet (only a few weeks out). They were meant to be Christmas gifts that my son would bring back east with him. We were there on Nov 9th. Needless to say we're 5 days out from Christmas and no bottles. HORRIBLE customer service or lack thereof. No responses to texts, emails or phone calls. I'm contacting my credit card company to refute the charge next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279MarkS279
50,Fun night out tour,This was our big event tonightA super cool tourNot like any other tour you’ve been onMore of an experienceFor your eyes ears and tastebudsSo much science and knowledge you may even call it a little geekyDefinitely worth the time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisnmaria
10,Scam artists,I ordered 2 bottles of rum from this place back in July and they told me 4-6 weeks to ship. Well it is now November and I haven't heard a peep from them since the 1st of October. The took my money and now won't return any texts or answer their phones. Do NOT take this tour do NOT buy any bottles from them. This place is a scam.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hypnotoad151
10,Horrible Business/ Customer Service,"The staff are extremely friendly, which is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 star's...but the tour is not that great. It just seemed like a ton of random ideas were just thrown together & voila there's your tour. They give you a total of 4 tastings; the 2 whiskey tastings were OK, but the 2 rum tastings were horrid.On top of that, the thing that's really frustrating is.... It takes 4-6 MONTHS to get one of their bottle's of the whiskey if you decide to purchase during the tour, because they are back logged. They tell you it'll come in about a month & a half, but that is a lie. I also had a friend where they simply just lost his order & never informed him about it... and wouldn't do anything to help fix the issue. Just horrible business etiquette overall. Save your money & time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronniemc29
50,This is a must!!!,If you want an unusual experience in LA this is the place. I am not a rum or whiskey drinker but I truly enjoyed this tour. I can not say enough about how much I learned on this tour but you will have an amazing time. There is a boat but so much more!!! This tour is worth the fee and the staff is truly knowledgeable and you can tell they love what they do. I can recommend this place enough. You have to try it out. I will be going back!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
50,Great fun’,"Kudos to the brilliant folks involved with Lost Spirits. In addition to the chemistry of creating whiskey in one iota the amount of time it has historically taken, their tour is wonderfully creative and sheer fun. Go with some other people - it’s a fun thing to do with other adults or adult children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Insalata17
50,Awesome decor,The tour was sooo much fun! I loved every new location we got to visit. The journey for the two hours was very informative and the alcohol was delicious. The alcohol is very strong soo if you’re a light weight bring a friend who can drink to help you out.It is definitely a mix of Willy Wonka/ Tiki tiki room/ pirates. The decor really gets you in the mood. Our guides were funny and well informed.I’m definitely going back in October when it becomes spookier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/besamehermosa
50,Exceeded expectations,"After seeing other reviews, I was worried that I should lower my expectations but this was an incredible experience. Even if you don’t care for the spirits, being around people who are so fiercely living their passions - not just alcohol but a range of creative endeavors - is inspiring. I will carry this experience with me - as an example of how to pursue your best life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296gailr
30,Not worth the hype,"Fun to do, but new tour still has growing pains, seems too polished. It was good to talk with other visitors and tour guides were cool. Some of the chemistry seemed a bit contrived.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scott_and_R
40,The New Lost Spirits,"Mixed reaction on this tour. The tour itself was informative but the amount of the actual working distillery was basically one room and an empty lab. During the first part of the tour they explained the context and beginnings of their journey unfortunately it lacked the charm and context of the original tour. Leaving the first building and hoping on the transportation they provided to and from the next location was really a fun adventure.The tasting of the Spirits was interesting. Their spirits are smooth and somewhat Smokey. Fun to taste the differences and to learn how each was made. We enjoyed how the chemistry geek really came out of our guide in the distillery and lab. If you purchase a bottle on tour you receive a return tour gold ticket. This way you can come back and see how the tour changes and sample different, improved, or new Spirits.All in all it was a fun two hours. The unfortunate part for us is the original location tour we felt was actually much better and even though they have tried to capture some of that essence in the beginning of this tour it just didn’t work very well. But we will give it some time and visit again in the future to see how they are growing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Serendipity5333
50,Really Unique Experience for Whiskey and Rum Lovers,"What a fun way to spend the evening...the staff was incredibly friendly, the story telling was incredibly enjoyable, the adventure is a bit unexpected (in a good way) and the educational aspect of was enlightening. Bonus: the tastings didn't stink either (note: you will end up buying some bottles of their sprits on the way out!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslietangy
50,The Magical Whiskey Experience,"If Disneyland ever needed a school for whiskey enthusiast, Lost Spirits Distillery would be the perfect academy of magical booze. Smack dab in the middle of the arts district comes a never before ventured experience that won the ""best distillery tour of 2018"" award. It felt like Willy Wonka himself should've came out of the curtains to give us the distillery tour of our lives.Starting from the entrance of the building all the way through the gift shop towards the end, the tour kept us truly captivated within its realm. I'm not sure if it's something in the drinks or the truly dedicated tour guides who made the experience one of a kind, but they hit the nail in the head when it comes to entertaining. And the best part of it all really is not that it's just fun as heck! but at the end of the night you leave the warehouse educated and mind boggled by the facts taught to you.to cap it off, Lost Spirits Distillery Tour is the perfect experience for whiskey lovers, escape room enthusiasts, theme park lovers, and just.....anyone who enjoys art and f.u.n. Here's your chance to feel like a kid again while you sip on that whiskey.Oh yes, and their whiskey bottle prices are reasonable too at about $45 a bottle. Buy a bottle and they present you with a free ticket for a second tour. Which is more than worth it considering they change the tour every couple of months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aadiputra89
50,The Willy Wonka of Liquior,"I enjoyed this place a lot! I do However like a cocktail and a story. This place is such a unique place, with interesting ideas, kooky things to see, and you learn things about spirits. I don’t want to give anything away but I was entertained and learned something along the way. I wish they would have poured a bit more into my glass, but hey that’s just me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3yarddogs

50,"Science, History and Fun All Rolled Up in One","Lost Spirits is located in the Arts District of Los Angeles. A group of us took the tour as a fun birthday celebration for a friend.I am mainly more of a wine drinker but thought this place sounded like it would be a fun experience and it was. It's hard to describe the experience as a whole but I'll go ahead and try anyway. It's sort of like a cross between the Pirates of the Caribbean ride meets Alice in Wonderland. The tour includes several different highly educated guides who explain the science and process of distilling rum and/or whiskey, with several tastings along the way. All or most of the liquor tastings are 80 proof or higher, so be sure and grab a bottle of water that they offer everyone when you start the tour. You'll probably need it! The tour itself takes place in several spaces as you are guided from one room to the next, either walking or at one point ""cruising"" to Whiskey Island in a boat. It's creatively imaginative and campy.You will need to make reservations online and the tickets are a bit pricey. It's not your run of the mill whiskey/rum tasting experience, but that's the whole point! Enjoy their award winning bottle of spirits and conversation. By the way, this are of LA is quickly becoming a hipsters haven with plenty of places to grab a bite before heading over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tishtop
40,Boozy,"This place was way fun with an added bonus , sips of high test booze . Kind of pricey for the tour but it's a fun thing to do with out of town guests and it's always changing .Added bonus they will sell you a bottle to take home , we did !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pioneer736675
50,Fun & Unusual Distillery Tour,"Very creative bunch here...lots of spirit about spirits...rum, brandy, and my favorite, a peat-infused whiskey. A must-see on any visit to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7024LNjenniferp
40,Amuzement for Adults,"This is a fun place - don't want to give too much away but it is super quirky and a fun way to hang out with friends and family. I am not into hard alcohol but took a sip from each sample - strong stuff!! I am giving this place 4 stars because at the end of the tour they give you a free return ticket for one with each bottle you purchase. This is a pretty good deal as the tour is $37 as of this write-up and the bottle isn't much more. The problem is we didn't find out till we got home and tried to book a free tour that our ""golden ticket"" was only good for a certain time each day. Before we purchased the bottle my husband and I stood in front of the lady checking us out and reviewed our calendars to see if there was even another time for us to come when family comes to visit over the holidays. After several minutes we decided we did have a small window of time and therefore bought the bottle of rum (to get the ticket really). Fast forward to home where I am entering in the code for a while only to get an ""error"" message over and over. I called and found out we could only use the golden tick at noon on the day we wanted to come back. This whole process (as the ticket sales vendor seemed a bit confused as to why the ticket didn't work either) took about 30 minutes to resolve. Of course - none of this would have happened if the lady selling us the bottle and offering a free return tour had told us this important detail up front - a bit of a bummer way to end a fun afternoon. Just be aware of that if you are purchasing a bottle to get a guest pass back for a free return tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annem261
30,Read the no-so-fine print!,"Firstly: if you are from California and purchase alcohol, make sure you read the electronic document that you are required to sign. They don't tell you that they are not allowed to sell alcohol to residents of California and that the alcohol cannot be consumed in California, yet you have to sign an affidavit that you don't live in California and it will not be consumed here.Other than that, it's an OK-ish tour. It's very informative. A bit over-enthusiastic and kitch. Too much time in the dark on ""rides"" that don't really add to the experience. The birds were AWFUL. The Chem E was the best tour guide of the 7 that are part of the whole tour. She seemed more knowledgeable and less from the script. And she was more genuine than Disney-like. The booze is really nice. Bummer that I wouldn't perjure myself to take some home!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/delingei
50,Lost Spirits Fun Place for Adults,"we were there this weekend with a group of 10 and had a great time. Super interesting and really cool location. My husband is very much into spirits and the process of making them, we were also just in Scotland and it was very interesting to see how they can make these spirits in such a short time. Brought home a bottle of their Rum which was really good. Hope to be back soon with our free ticket for buying the rum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovetospend
50,"Lost Spirits is Magical, Educational and Amazing!","Holy cow!! Had no idea what the tour was going to be like - we were completely blown away. We recently returned from Ireland and very much enjoyed the award-winning Jameson Distillery tour...it is nowhere near as incredible as the Lost Spirits tour! The Lost Spirits is fun, enchanting, mystical and educational. The tasting is great and offered two rum and two whisky samples - all samples were excellent. The presentation quality is top notch and the guides are fun and informative (though the technical portions might be simplified a bit for us laypeople). We parked about a block away at a paid lot. A total hidden gem in the LA Arts District. Excited to return again in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UltimateHaunt
50,"CAMPY, CREEPY (in a good way), CARNIVAL DISTILLERY TOUR IN DTLA","WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS TOUR:The nerdy, passionate young scientists who created this method and their tour!The kitschy, tongue-in-cheek delivery of the information.The variety of speakers, so you didn’t get bored;The vague spookiness of the whole tour;STRONG ALCOHOL!!! And I loved all the different vessels they used at the different stops. (But how did they get washed and replaced between each tour???? Magic?)Rides! Poor man’s Pirates of the Caribbean; merry-go-round;The hilarious Tiki Room at the end, where the birds sell the goods to you;The T-shirt reference to Kelis’ 2003 monster hit “Milkshake” …yet no explanation offered.The sincere and helpful manner in which all the guides and internet personnel engaged, especially Lauren (: .Lost Spirits Distillery = LSD! Coincidence?The fact that this distillery may just revolutionize the whole distilling business.WHAT I HATED ABOUT THIS TOUR:Nothing! It was completely original and fascinating!BUT A FEW TIPS:It’s a distillery, folks, so it’s HOT. Dress cool. They’ll give you water bottles. And wear close-toed shoes.No bathroom breaks once the tour starts. I hear you really should visit the bathroom, though, whether you have to go or not.Parking can be difficult on the weekends unless you get lucky with street parking; otherwise, you’ll have to go to one of those overpriced lots.Make sure you have reservations! They are very cutting edge about keeping in contact with you and sending your information.I’ll be back . . . with more people in tow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathiek611
40,Boozy Disneyland,"Lost Spirits has taken something that could be boring and has turned it into a spirits Disneyland for adults. Through faux rides they taught us about their unique distilling process, which is quite fascinating. There are two reasons why I can't give this 5 stars: It was stiflingly hot during our tour (friends say it's even hot when it's cold outside), and I didn't care for three of the four spirits we tasted.At the conclusion of the tour, guests are held in a room while animatronic animals and live humans pitch you to buy the distillery's booze and merch. I paid handsomely for the tour, why should I be subject to a 15 minute sales pitch?I'm glad I did the tour, but, in spite of assurances that things are constantly changing, wouldn't do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxG583
50,Great tour! A must for whiskey lovers!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when my brother and his wife invited the hubby and I to do this whiskey tour. There are 10 people per tour, so it's not going to be crowded on your adventure. Yes, I said adventure. The folks at the distillery are very creative and worked hard to make the tour a fun time! Every room is different and each ""tour guide"" is very knowledgeable with everything that goes into creating delicious tasting whiskey's and rums. I had no idea how much chemistry went into making liquor! It is interesting, it is fun, it is definitely a unique experience! Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibhayhay

50,Something Different,"I saw this place on a travel site that I follow on Facebook. Knowing, my husband liked whiskey, I thought it would be a good birthday gift.It’s very unique and situated in the heart of Downtown LA. The staff was extremely nice and knowledgeable. I loved everything about it. They had animatronics, a boat ride, themed rooms, and I don’t want to give it all away. But, I recommend this place especially if you are a nerd at heart like myself. The whiskey is amazing but very strong.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizR1479
50,Best TOUR Ever!,"This distillery has so many 5 star reviews that I think might just be lost in the mix. But I should add to the pile to generate more confidence and popularity for this truly awesome experience. Everyone is ridiculously friendly, they've got a great sense of humor, they've created a unique time, and they're constantly improving. Take an uber or lyft so there's no chance of not enjoying LSD responsibly. You learn, you drink, you live, you laugh, you walk, you ride, you plunge into darkness. Lost spirits has so much to offer you could even enjoy it sober. If you've ever even slightly enjoyed a distillery tour or wine tasting, or brewery tour, you'll love LSD. If you've never done a tour elsewhere, you may be ruined after LSD; there's just nothing like it out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesseh853
50,Weirdly Awesome Distillery Experience in the Heart of Los Angeles,"I came here with my husband, dad & mom after seeing the Distillery featured in a Forbes article. I didn't know what to expect but was surprised at how awesome the tour was.I don't want to spoil the experience and go by each room, but Lost Spirits really takes you into a different world. You feel like you are part of their distilling process, and it's also super interesting and I learned a lot. The staff is great and passionate about what they do, which adds to the experience. It's a fun activity to do if you're in Los Angeles and I would highly recommend it.My only note would be to offer either heavier pours or more tastings. We tasted 4 spirits (2 rums, 2 whiskeys), which were delicious and strong. It was great to learn about them while you enjoyed them, I just wish we could enjoy more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/373hilaryg
50,Awesome tour (and I am more of a wine person),"Such a unique tour. I enjoyed the tastings (whisky and rum) but honestly, I am more of a wine person myself. Yes the liquor is great if you are into that type of thing. But even if not, you will enjoy the stories and the atmosphere. Highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8352LGjulies
40,Enjoyed the tour,"Took the Lost Spirits tour last weekend with my wife & daughter. It was a fun and enjoyable experience even though we do not care much for hard liquor. These guys (& woman) are on the cutting edge of new technology in the industry and were happy to answer questions. The tour was fun and their vision was kind of like Pirates of the Caribbean meets Willie Wonka, Dr. Frankenstein and Jack Daniels.If you have a few hours to spare and want to do something fun and out of the ordinary I would recommend the Lost Spirits Distillery tour. Oh yeah, the Abomination ""Sayers of the truth"" was pretty good (I bought a bottle).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gdude-77

(My lack of visual aids is because I don't want to ruin all the surprises, so DONT!!! go through the pictures!)After you enter you HAVE to use the restroom! That's all you're getting out of me! JUST DO IT!!!!Then the even better stuff starts! This privately owned voyage not only has your tastebuds in euphoria, but also has your eyes, ears and touch going nuts! I don't believe there was a sense I wasn't engaging on my tour... that's right.... even my sixth sense!This journey is a merger of humour, history, science, education and pure clean fun! And if that's not enough, at your last stop they invite you back for round two for a future undetermined date with the magic!I don't want to give away any more than that but if I could give a million stars, damn straight I would!Now GO already! NO FOR REAL!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charliniss

50,The most entertaining distillery tour EVER,"Everyone knows that I have put together hundreds of outings over the years, but let me preface this by saying that two of my closest friends told me it was the absolute best event I have ever organized.The Lost Spirits Distillery tour is the best kept secret in this entire city! (If it isn't I would surely love you to point out what is so I can go.)This rum and whiskey distillery has been created by nerds and geeks who absolutely revel in their nerdy geekery in all its glory.The tour is like nothing you have ever experienced no matter how many distilleries or breweries you might have toured in your lifetime. It's as if Willy Wonka and Walt Disney on a small budget decided to concoct alcohol and invited friends to come visit their creation, that's what we got to experience tonight, with two of the most enthusiastic tour guides you'll ever be lucky to get.I should also point out that I don't particularly care about alcohol, but this would be a truly great and fun experience even if you don't partake in the tastings.
