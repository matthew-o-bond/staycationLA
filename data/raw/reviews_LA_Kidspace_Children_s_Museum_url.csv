50,Great children's museum,"We've visited many children's museum and this is definitely one of the better ones. Our favorite by a fairly large margin is still the one in Indianapolis but our children certainly loved this one as well. We made our visit to Kidspace in February on a Friday. It was a nice day, which was fortunate as most of the best stuff was outdoors (the physics park, Arroyo Adventure area). Our kids are 7 and 6 and I thought they were the perfect age for this museum. We spent about 5 hours there and they could have kept going. Only drawback was that the adults have to pay the same admission price as the kids. I know adults have to pay at the Indianapolis museum but I would argue there is more for adults to do at the Indianapolis museum besides just supervising their children. Kidspace does allow folks to bring in their own food and snacks, which helps those on a budget.",snootchiebootchies
50,Family Visit,What a great day! Our family had a great visit while visiting with an 18 month old.Plenty of activities to keep the entire family entertained.,Shannon Moler
10,Filthy,Filthy dirty and can do without.If you live the chuckee cheese crowd - you will love this place! Bring all your baby mammas!,LAGuy534
50,The kids loved it!,"This is great for kids! There are so many things for them to do there! Adults will die of boredom, no doubt, but the kids will CRY when they have to leave (mine did). Bring swimsuits and towls for the little creek to wade in. Oh and the kids cafe is a bit unrealistic and insane what with their menu choices. I'm sorry, but you can make vegetables look like any animal in the world, and the kids STILL won't eat it - an you've just spent 24$ for two lunches. Other than that, yeah, I'd go again. It was a home run for my kids! Very lovely for the littles!",Lili_A
50,Great for kids,"Your kids will love the variety of activities. You Can spend quite a long time there. We became members for several years to take the grandkids there. Really loved the monarch butterfly experience. also, they brought in truckloads of snow and everyone got to play in it. Spend at least three to four hours, maybe more depending on ages and interest of kids.",wheretonext08
50,Yes!!!,This is just the most perfect children’s museum! My little cousins love to come and just run free. They especially love making me climb to the very top of the leaf exhibit. We’ve been here a few times for birthdays and just because.,MarketingDiva
50,"Took the grandkids there, had a great time","Visiting the LA area we needed a place for entertaining the grandkids for a day. Kidspace was the perfect hands on activity, good for both the 4 year old and the 18 month old.",mrancer
50,Really great,Tons of things to do sure to find something every kid will like. Very active and engaging. Probably best for kids <10,bkct1
40,very nice place for picnic,Freshy air and soft green grass .It's very nice place for a familly gathering and picnic.specially with children.,정순 박
50,Not to be missed with the children/grandchildren! We're Regulars and Members,"Every visit to Kids Space has been delightful. Since the birth of our grandson, we have visited about 30 time and spent at least three hours . Best membership value and activities offered! We have celebrated Halloween and a Snow experience. Every time we go we participate in a different craft project where the staff is so helpful and nice. I like that the membership is accepted at other children's museums,too. The playground in front when crossing from the parking lot is great too!",Nancy
40,a cool kid's museum,"My family spent a long weekend in Pasadena/San Gabriel valley and we visited Kidspace. It's a nice area. We ended up parking a little bit away but walked through some nice park area.The museum has a gardens area, an amphitheater, a courtyard where kids can ride trikes on tracks, a pavilion with the opportunity to make paper airplanes and other things in their workshop, a tower climbing area, a green house, bottle rocket area, and their outdoor area has 12 hands on exhibits that help kids understand physics.They are open Tuesday - Friday: 9:30am to 5 pm and on Mondays from March 18 to September 2. They are also open Saturday & Sunday from 10 to 5. Admission is $14 for adults and children. But children under 1 are free.We liked so many aspects of this museum. My son liked smelling the ""fake"" animal poops. He liked making the paper airplanes. He thought the trike track outside was super cool even though he was pretty big for the trike. He also liked climbing to the top of the towers. We also liked the rockets and levels outside.This was a fun museum!",jelico8
50,Better than it looks,"Having lived in L.A my whole life, I have known about this place since my kids were little. I have never taken them here until recently and I am so glad I did. The pictures don't do it justice and that's why I have never taken the little there before. This place is designed for kids. Its not fancy and its not eye-catching, but it has all the elements that make it engaging and interactive for those little brains and bodies.Outside are numerous activity stations, such as large blocks, a magnetic pendulum, air ball guns, and tricycle rides. Inside are rock climbing activities, a play stage with lights and microphone, magnetic toys, dinosaur digging, craft area and a reptile room.My four year old boy spent 4 hours there playing and having a blast. It was paradise for him.There is also a cafe, which has kid friendly lunches and adult food as well. I'd skip this next time. The food is nothing special and I did see lots of parents who brought lunches from home. I would do that if and when we come again. There is a large outdoor eating area with plenty of tables and some cute water geysers that spurt up water periodically. The kids seem to like this as well, but we were there on a cold day so couldn't enjoy it as much.A gift shop sells lots of cool toys and junk. My son had to have the stuffed animal snake. Paid $14 for it. But worth it because he's been playing with it for 2 days now.All the staff are friendly and polite and helpful. I really appreciated the guy running the tricycles in the back. he was very nice, and engaging with my son when he was on the bike path.A great way to spend the day for kids.",cynsevgilim
50,Children science museum with perfect balance of indoor/outdoor activities,"This museum is definitely more interactive than most other children science museums that we have been to. It has a good balance of indoor and outdoor activities. There are 3 climb structures, an ant tunnel that kids can climb across and art nd crafts table. There are 2 tracks for biking where kids can learn motor control and hand eye coordination, as well as understanding signals and signs. A walk at the back hill expose you to many arts as well as the science of sounds. At the front, you can learn many science experiments by doing. It is fun and will definitely return on our next visit to LA.",sbudiman
40,Great place to take kids but really crowded during free time on Tuesdays,"Visited with kids from ages 3-1/2 to 9 and they really liked it although the crowds during free time on Tuesdays (from 4-8pm) dampened their enthusiasm (lines for many activities, out of craft materials, etc.). There are lots of cool things to do-- the kids I was was with enjoyed the physics section with a lot of hands on activities and experiments, a fun tricycle race track, an outdoor stream to wade in, a hawk's nest for climbing and going across a rope bridge, rock climbing wall, and very tall climbing features (about 3 stories and not adult friendly). I recommend this as a place to take kids-- ages 4-10 probably the best fit. Although the free is nice, it might be worth it to pay and go at a less crowded time (if there is one).",davisellu
50,"It's always packed on ""free day""","Yes, I have to be cheap so I try to head there on the one free day each month. But it is always packed. Still worth the visit with your youngun.",Robert L
40,What a Blast!,"My grandkids love this place because they can run, climb, hide, scramble, and do all those things that kids should be doing.",Paul T
50,A Young Scientist’s Dream,"This interactive museum is great for toddlers through elementary school kids. Lots of hands-on activities (pulleys, rocket blasting, block building) in the physics forest. Kids who like insects will enjoy the crawl through the ant hole. Bigger kids love the climbing towers, too.",kpws2018
50,Fun place for kids,We held our CAAEYC - honoring the educators 2018. It has full of discovery and exploration. I wished I brought my son here but hopefully someday I'll be back and visit this place again.,Jacqueline W
50,Fantastic fun!,"Wonderful outdoor museum full of great hands-on learning exhibits. Make sure to bring a change of clothes a towel and water shoes - your kids will get muddy and wet! Perfect day out with children, do not miss it!",Haley J
50,Great experience with a 2 year old!,"Spent three hours here with a two year old and could easily have been there longer. Lots to do with this age group, with the mud area being the biggest hit. Bring a change if clothes for the kids and let them dive in! The under three room was great, too. The staff were very helpful. Worth every penny!",Catslick1
50,Wonderful place!,"This place never fails! We have a wonderful time every time we go! My older boys love to visit all the fun places outside, while my youngest and I visit the baby area inside and have some mommy and me baby time. They really know what they are doing at Kidspace. It’s developmentally appropriate fun, while learning! A must if you are visiting Pasadena as a family, or even if you live in Pasadena!",Vanessa R
40,Limited for toddlers,"We brought our 20-month-old granddaughter here. She enjoyed it, but we were surprised at the limited hands-on experiences for the toddler set.One nice point was having a special room for the little ones (ECLC, Early Childhood Learning Center). If play areas are cross-overs with older elementary children, the toddlers are often over-run by the older kids and have little chance to try out the play areas. There was a crawl-through tunnel, basket chairs low enough for toddlers to get in and out safely, short slides, and lots of padding everywhere. It was also a nice surprise to have a storyteller arrive to read to the kids.There is a bathroom conveniently connected directly to the play area. Socks are required for adults and suggested for the kids.Outside there was a separate track for the toddlers with push trikes or trikes with pedals.A lot of the outside interactive activities were interesting, but geared more to elementary children.We were able to get our family discounts on the entry fee since we are members of a children's museum in our town that is part of the children's museum network.Free parking is available.",TravelingFan22
50,All kinds of fun,"Are you into art? or mud? or tricycles? or climbing? or spelunking like ants? or hot glue guns? or physics? or legless lizards? or building things? Then they've got that going on at kidspace.If you're two adults and one kid (like us), it's spendy. But there was so much weird stuff going on. At first, our kid was over-stimulated and just ran from thing to thing, but once she settled in, it was hard to get her to shift to a new activity.We eventually left with a doll we made in the craft area and the certainty that we'll be back.",Sawadee28
50,lots to do...,Took 5 grandkids here...ages 3-7..they loved it..lots of activities ...from walking among the dinosaurs...going into tunnels...riding bikes in a little track...they loved it..the staff was super helpful...both indoors and outdoor things to do...very close to the Rose Bowl...a great afternoon for the kids,eyeu
30,It's ok if you're in the area,"If you're in the area and doing a visit, sure, but if you're planning to get a membership, I would recommend Discovery Cube over Kidspace Children's Museum for the price. Highlights are 3 climbing structures that kids can do in couple minutes. There are other exhibits but they're not as engaging nor educational as CA Science Center. Worth a visit if you're in the area, sure, but I keep going to Discovery Cube or CA Science Center instead of Kidspace.",BigBoyA77
50,What a great place to keep children engaged,"As an ""adventure"" for our 4-year-old granddaughter, we went to Kidspace Children's Museum in Pasadena. It was a bit confusing to get there on the day we went because the Rose Bowl was hosting its monthly Flea Market the same day (the Rose Bowl is next to the Kidspace Children's Museum, which offers free parking in Lot I). Once inside the museum, it was all FUN for her. She loved the Pulleys, the Pendulum, the Giant Lever and riding on the tricycle track. Indoors, she liked climbing the ""Tower,"" and making something at the ""Found Art"" table. She pretended to be ""Indiana Jones"" by discovering dinosaur bones and driving his all-terrain vehicle.",Lena K
50,Enzo’s favorite,"Enzo just loves ❤️❤️❤️ the Kidspace museum in Pasadena. There are so many things to do and special events that you just can’t go wrong. Water, music, obstacle courses, food, and do on. We have been going for years. Memberships are reasonable.",karinegridonatelli
50,First time with our 4 yrs old,"Our friend invited us to meet at this place, so that our kids can play together while we were visiting. Together we have a 11 years old boy and two almost 4 years old girls. All three of them had so much fun there. We just watched them running around, touching everything they can get their hands on. It was a weekday night, but still lots families with kids were there. We really enjoyed our first visit. Planning to visit again next time we are in town.",Margie Y
10,Pumpkin Festival - Beware,"On Saturday we had the misfortune of having to attend an event at the Rose Bowl/Kidspace area. Parking was insane! After driving up and down aisles for over 15 minutes, we were able to find a man leaving and he had us follow him to his car. We patiently waited for him to put his child in the car seat and fold up the stroller and pack it away. While we were waiting for the parking spot, several people asked us if we were waiting, which we replied we were and they politely drove off. Then we had a ""lady"" in a SUV drive up and put her blinker on. We politely told her we were waiting. She told us to ""F-off, it's my spot"". The nice man who was parked in the spot told her we were waiting and she told him to ""F-off"". I got out of the car to go over and tell her sorry, but we have been waiting for this spot. She proceeded to move her car closer to where I was standing. Again, the gentleman got out of his car to tell her we were waiting and she needed to calm down. She was revving her engine and moving closer to me. I told her I was going to stand in the spot, to which she replied that she would ""run me over with her car"". Luckily I was able to stay calm and tell her that would be assault with a deadly weapon and I can call the police. She responded with some lovely language, calling me every name in the book. Driving off like a crazy person flipping me off and yelling out of her window. We parked and I waited by our car for a few minutes as we were afraid she would come back to our car to inflict damage. I then walked up to the first security guard I saw and told them what had happened. She said she had already seen 3 fights in the parking lot break out over parking.I understand that this area is known for hosting a multitude of events. What I don't understand is why there is not a more of a organized effort to help people with parking. Or why there can't be security guards patrolling the area so situations like I had do not occur. I do not appreciate having to be threatened by a crazed person nor have my children hear foul language.Our experience yesterday made me never want to go near Kidspace again! You obviously do not care about the safety of your patrons!",UpsetMommie
50,Interesting place,Nice place to visit with children. My kid loved to run around and played with another kids. Very safety place.,255sofiaj
50,Great fun for my four year old.,"I grew up in Pasadena and went to original Kidspace. In the 2000s, they relocated here to Brookside Park, where the Rose Bowl is.There is a lot of great outdoor activities for kids, including riding tricycles, walking along a creek with water wheel. Lots of indoor climbing as well.They have a nature exchange, where you can bring a shell or seeds collected from your home to trade for other shells/seeds/rocks there.The museum is very clean and there are plenty of workers to help you. There's even a breastfeeding room.Great museum, wish there was one like this where we live.",rkmoy
50,Kidspace Rocks,"Went with grandkids ages almost 7 and 4, parents and grandparents (us). This place absolutely rocks. Every exhibit and activity has been carefully thought out & designed to tease, appease and please kids! Even so-called adult kids.Our kids played nearly every outdoor exhibit, especially loving the physics challenge ones. Indoors, the climbing spots held court, for them. The insect and plant exhibits fascinated them (and us!). They made butterfly feeders from citrus sections and wire. They jumped through hoops. Then again going outside they splashed and danced through water in the splashing pools and creeks. It was all in an amazing experience for all of us. Woohoo!",aresverde
50,Wonderful!,"Fun, friendly children's museum. Very clean, many activities available. Exhibits are in different buildings, and many activities are outside....so this should be considered before visiting on a rainy day. Staff is excellent...engaging, knowledgeable, helpful.",Kristi H
30,Great activities for kids,"Pricey, so that's why only 3 stars. The average working family would probably not be able to afford this museum. At $13 for each adult and each child a family of 4 would pay $52. That prices out working class families.",Sheila S
50,A good fun filled learning day!,"My daughters are 4 and 6 so I worried about whether or not they both would be interested in the activities and sights that the museum had to offer but it was perfect for their age group. They made friends, played with clay, dipped their feet in the little man made river, learned about how air pressure and magnets work, looked at bugs and other insects, made art, ate a healthy lunch from the cafe, watered a few plants in the green house, explored the bridge, rock climbed, and so much more. I would definitely bring them back. This place is perfect for a school field trip.",MommyOnAFunMission
50,A must if you are traveling with kiddos,Perfect place to let them run and get the wiggles out. Very artsy and creative. A one of a kind place in the area for kids. Perfect park location. The food was good. I have nothing but the best referral to take your little ones here while in town.,KellyLLouisee
50,Our great grandkids love it!,"Whenever our great grandkids come for a visit, they have to go to Kidspace. There are lots of opportunities for creative interaction -- the last project that came home was a bee made from a plastic water bottle and an assortment of other plastic salvage pieces, straws, hairpins, etc. -- terrific!",Joseph H
40,Very Nice Place to Bring Small Children,"We were there with a 5 year old and a good time was had by all. I have been to many children's museums and this one had a good variety of activities, both indoors and out. There were areas that allowed for art, dress-up, fossils, climbing and outdoor activities that explained some of the laws of physics in fun ways. There was even a snow play area. While the museum was overall relatively crowded, it was no worse than I have seen elsewhere and there was always something that was not crowded. There were really only two complaints I had: (1) due to the fact that we were there a few days before the Rose Bowl Parade, the normal parking lots were occupied by pre-parade staging so it was a bit of a walk to get to the museum (2) the volunteers were not very helpful in the various ""activity"" areas, but basically, I think it was because most seemed about high school aged and clearly not trained in how to actively engage with children and provide useful instructions on what to do. If it were not for the parents showing initiative, it would have been a bad experience for children.",Mark
20,Overcrowded and small,"Staff is friendly and venue is nice, however, it is too small to make it worth your child's time. Too crowded with too little to do. Maybe on a slow day it will be worth it but not on a Weekend with many people around.",StonewallJackson2015
50,Great place,Friendly staff and a large area outdoors for the kids and the inside is great as well...learning made fun,travelshooter71
30,Kidspace - Great Potential But Needs to Get It's Act Together,"I brought my two grandchildren there for a birthday, (ages 3,4) and although the museum certainly has potential, it suffered from disorganization & inadequate staffing and maintenance. Staff didn't appear to be well-trained and knowledgeable and were ill prepared for the most part to guide kids through the exhibits. The science experiments had no instruction/leadership and the kids were basically playing with the exhibits. Some of the exhibits were in complete disarray, with apparently no staff routinely putting them back into shape after kids rifled through them. The running brook had algae growing on some of the rocks, which caused them to be very slippery and I witnessed a few kids take nasty tumbles. The museum is well-conceived but needs freshening up, and certainly needs more professional organization and leadership. Sorry to be so negative, but we drove a few hours to get there for a birthday and were really disappointed.",zumanbabe
50,Excellent Learning Space,"We took our near 2 year old grandson here to explore... what an excellent place, especially the outdoor science park. In fact we all enjoyed it so much that we bought our son's family a 1-year membership so they can take the kids back a lot.There's a nice little space for sitting down and having a cool drink or snack, so you really can plan on spending a lot of time here with your children and grand children of all ages.",Richard M
40,Toddler Paradise,"We are a member here, we bought a 6 month membership. It is great for toddler and big kids as well. They have an infant/toddler area for play (3yrs old max) that is padded all they around w/c is where we usually start of at then go to the other areas that has mixed age kids. My twin 2 yrs old boys are in the small side so, I liked that area best. They also can not go anywhere in that room where we can't see them so it is nice not hover around.The mixed age zone is great as well, but just make sure you watch for older kids. Understanding they do get excited. The Splash Pad area w/c was our favorite last year is actually not working, but they have a small stream at the back and water play area for hot days.My only complain is the Physics/Science zone is an outdoor area, CA weather can get hot during summer and it doesn't have much shade. So do not forget sunblock if you are visiting that zone.Food court is great as well, w/ a decent food choices. They actually added more chairs and table w/c is great. As a member you get discount on food purchases.",Karen D
50,Great for Kids,"Kidspace is a great place to take the kids for a fun and educational day trip. The kids seminars are fun, the climbing areas keep them all occupied and the staff is VERY helpful.",gordie m
30,Informational,"We took our 2 year old for the first time. She loved the ""digging for fossils"" area, of course the kiddie zone outside, the music instruments outdoors, etc. Overall, it was very informational but I think I will take her again when she's a bit older. The bathrooms should be cleaned more often though.There's a lot to learn! Would be great kids camp for older kids.",16Diamonds

Well worth it for the kiddies and adults. The lil river and waterfall can be a bit slippery so keep an eye on your kids and make sure they mind the rules! Julian and Kimberly were working the day we went and were so awesome. If you have an afternoon and kids well worth a visit!,Christopher V

50,Free Family Night,"They have free family nights on first Tuesday of every month, but for June this year, it was on a Wednesday. My kids had a great time. They have a lot of this to explore, such as bugs area where they have live honey bee colony, lizards. They have a little river stream up the hill where kids can splash around. They also have a shooting game for kids which my son was hogging for a good 30 mins. I'll definitely go back during free nights.",Janetsplanet
10,Slippery and Dangerous!,"On Saturday (6/11/16), we took our 2 1/2 year old grand-daughter to Kid Space. She has been there several times when in town visiting. All that day, it was lightly raining and the water feature was not operating as it was also rather chilly for Southern California. While we were seated near the base of the ramp leading down from the ticket kiosk awaiting food to be delivered, our grand-daughter was walking around near our table. The concrete was very slippery due to rain and especially the build up of tree sap on the ground. She was wearing new tennis shoes with excellent traction - nonetheless, she slipped and landed on the back of her head.Then in a matter of 5 minutes, three other children also slipped and landed on the back of their heads. We think that one of the children went unconscious for a brief period of time.I spoke to a staff member about the danger to toddlers and the slippery ground and she told me that it was not her responsibility. I approached another staff member with the same result.Once my grand-daughter calmed down (no serious injury to her, it appears at this time), my wife and her mother took her into the adjacent building while I walked over to the first aid building, to wit, the reaction to the dangerous condition was deplorable.1) there was no emergency procedure to address such circumstances2) nobody asked me to complete an accident report3) I was given a small piece of paper ( 2"" x 3"") and was asked to write a note about it (as it was too small to be productive, I chose not to do so)4) they called the manager and were told that she was busy and would be over in 15 minutes and that I should have a seat5) I was told they were short of staff and were unable to cover the site properly6) I generally found the staff to be rude and indifferent7) Interestingly, while there was very thin staff coverage on the site throughout our visit, I saw at least 8 staff in the back room of the first aid building sitting around on their cell phones!Wow!The place has a rather profound leadership problem.What would happen if something bad really happens?The leadership should be ashamed of themselves",S0ftball28
50,An exceptional place to take little ones or tweens,"I have often taken my grandson to this wonderful museum. When he was just a toddler, he loved to go the room for little guys. Now that he is older, he enjoys the little spring that cools off the hot and weary on a hot summer day. It is a great place for hands on learning.",Elizabeth J
50,Amazing,"Visiting from out of state needed something to occupy 4 grandkids ages 1, 3, 5 and 8 while mom and dad were in meetings. I found this on line and what an amazing place. Fun for the grandkids, educational and easy on me. I spent 6 hours there one day and we all loved it",Trip142801
40,Kids space but room for more,"Kidspace has lots of things to divert children. Hopefully you will want to play too. The best part about this space is that you can get right in there and play too. There is a trike path, great things to climb, a dino dig, tables to do puzzles. It is on the Rose Bowl grounds so parks are plentiful. Plenty of places to walk around outside.",deabs8
40,Nice but overcrowded,"Went here with my 4 and 6 year old on a Friday morning right after it opened. Very quickly it became overcrowded with 3 school groups. It soon became overwhelming for my 4 year old so we had to leave. Nice physics exhibits and climbing structures. There are a couple areas for toddlers and a greenhouse. There were some creatures likes spiders, snake, turtle, and bees. Also, the gardens were closed as they are putting in a new exhibit and raising admission prices. There is a gift shop and cafe. Free parking near Rose Bowl and playground in nearby park.",CentralCATraveler
50,Wonderful place,This is a wonderful place to take children up to around age 12 or 13. There are many activities for them and it is a safe environment for learning and playing with others.,Judy K
40,Fun place near the Rose Bow,"We went to Kids Space in December when the artificial snow was there and the kids were having a blast jumping in them and making snow balls. It was quite a site to see, snow in Pasadena? There were also many arts and crafts for the kids to make and the teachers were great and very patient with them. Additionally, there were many activities which challenge the kids such as riding tricycles, designing their own cookies (then promptly eat them), digging in the sand like an archaeologist, climbing in a jeep which resembles that of Indiana Jones, etc. Needless to say, the kids had a great time there and didn't want to come home. Can you blame themselves?",Sammy T

50,Love the new physics garden,"I expected that our 2nd and 4th graders would have outgrown this, but we had to drag them away to meet friends for dinner.

50,Mommy & Me Day @ Kidspace,"I had the day off & was debating if I should drop-off H at daycare so I can run errands & cleanup (something I put off for several weeks :-X), or spend the day with her. Since I'm a working mom, I felt guilty for not spending some quality time with her. After minimal internal debate, I had to figure out what to do with her so we can have a FUN day.I didn't want to go to an amusement park, nor was I in the mood to chase her around a local park (she runs fast for a toddler =)~ I like to see you try to catch her). I thought about going to the L.A. Children's Museum (had a field trip there when I was in elementary), but they've been closed for almost 10 years. :-( After a few internet searches, I decided to take her to Kidspace Children's Museum.It was a good thing I checked out their website to prepare myself... the museum has multiple water play areas (& it was going to be a warm day) so they recommend to dress accordingly & bring a towel, change of clothes, spare shoes. I had planned to arrive when they open but was running late... good thing too, it was PACKED with school groups, even though it was almost noon.Upon entry, the first thing H did was get wet at Splash Dance in the central courtyard. Then she got upset because she was wet & made me change her (& I only brought 1 change of clothes so I warned her that she may not get wet in the new outfit-there's another water play area further in). Once she was dry, H immediately took off to the Galvin Physics Forest; she loved the variety of hands-on activities. Though there were a couple of sharing incidents, she was pretty gracious of letting the other kids play with the parts she was already using/holding.H explored the whole musuem... she did some arts & crafts in Digging Deeper Gallery, sang in EC Learning Center, rode a bunch of different bikes at Trike Tracks, played drums at Water Symphony... she tried to drag out her departure by helping the staff cleanup. She was such a good helper, they gave her high 5s & said she deserves a star (then she asked me where's her star, LOL, so I compromised & said there are stickers waiting for her at home).The Kidspace Café offers both hot & cold meals: sandwiches, burgers, pizza, salad; soup, fruit, veggie sticks, fries, desserts (cookies, mini cupcakes, ice cream), & a variety of beverages. The prices were reasonable & the fare was surprisingly tasty. :-D Kidspace also welcome you to bring your own food but no glass bottles or aluminum cans. Food may be eaten in their central courtyard or in the park in front of the museum.I think H had more fun here than her last 2 trips to Disneyland (she had sunstroke on her last trip even though we kept her hydrated & in the shade). After our FUN day (I had to do a 30-minute countdown so she would leave ""willingly""), we made a quick stop at ConfeXion Cupcakes for some goodies to take home. We're definitely coming back for their Easter Egg Hunt on 04/19/14 - 04/20/14.",Kimberly L
40,Engaging for young kids,"I took my 2 year old son and 3 year old daughter on a weekend afternoon and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded. There were plenty of challenging activities and exhibits to keep them engaged and entertained. My daughter loved the climbing tower, but I would recommend supervision part of the way up in case they get scared. If you have toddlers, they are going to want to play in the water area, so bring a bathing suit and a change of clothes. I think the ideal age is 4-7, but there is plenty of interesting exhibits and activities for younger and slightly older children. Food court could be more efficient using a self serve method rather than the current use of a single line. It took me 15 minutes to buy a drink, which is risky with 2 active toddlers. If you live within a reasonable distance, the membership is a better deal than the single entrance fee.",McKennas_Daddy
40,Fun memories,"We didn't get to spend as much time as I'd liked here. I grew up going to the old Kidspace and wanted to check out this new location with my kids.It's a little confusing to get here as it's tucked around in one of the parks around the Rose Bowl. The parking we used is a little farther than I expected. Not too far, but when you get out of the car you see a bunch of different paths, but you aren't entirely sure which one to take.There's a beautiful tunnel as you enter the building and a lot of fun exhibits outside. My son (7 years old) played outside for most of the time with the physics experiments. My daughter (4 years old) played inside on the climbing tree/ towers for most of the time. There's a fun ""swap"" program in one of the nature rooms. I guess kids can bring in interesting nature things and early points they can trade for little items (rocks, shells, etc.). A simple and great way to get kids exploring in nature.We saw their spiders, snakes, and tortoise. The kids particularly liked the tortoise and asked many questions with a very patient handler. The staff we interacted were really fun, some shared their good memories of the old kidspace location.There's a small cafe that you can order a good selection of lunch. We had a feta/hummus wrap. It came with a small salad and it was nice fresh one. Kids had a some chicken nugget things.Next time we come to the area, we'll make a point to stop here again.",marmac_10
50,A perfect place for your preschool/gradeschool kids,"I've taken my grandkids here numerous times. They're always excited to go. From playing in the pretend canteen and serving us pretend food to climbing all over the place to the craft activities, they are never ready to leave when I am!",K C
30,Decent place,This kids museum is nice and has a large outdoor space for the kids. My kids enjoyed the large rock climbing wall out side and the climbing equipment inside. The live bugs exhibit was cool. I have been to better kids museums but this museum wasn't to bad just a little on the small side. This museum is tucked away so it was a little difficult to find.,Maritza C
50,Great Place for an Afternoon with the Kids,"There is always something going on for kids at the museum. My grandsons always rode the little cars and were wowed by the earthquake demonstration. They are teenagers now so they've outgrown it, but we had lots of fun here when they were younger.",slynnmirell
50,Kidspace Children's Museum,"This is a great place for children ages 2 - 10. There are many activities, from sorting plant seeds to crawling in an imaginary ant hole, and more. If the weather is warm, bring a swim suit, or at least a change of clothes, and sandals that can get wet, for playing in the many fountains. You don't have to bring lunch, since there is a place to get lunch on site.",stanfordkuninrubin
40,Cool place for kids,"A cool place to take your kids. I took my two-year-old here, but I think this place is better suite for kids who are in the age range of 5-11. The reason being is that the science behind the different attractions can be appreciated more. For younger kids it is still fun and engaging. For the price, it is bargain. I would advise you to arrive early. Say 10 am at the latest. It seems to get really crowded by noon and two-three hours is probably enough time to spend here. It is rather small geographically, but still fun. The surrounding area of Pasadena is also a pretty nice neighborhood.",Ivan M
30,Limited things to do after tree incident,"We went the day after some trees unfortunately fell on some children at the entrance and got some serious news attention. We hope the injured kids are OK.The facilities seemed to be drastically minimized. Many if the outdoors paths were closed so there wasnt much to do, except for playing along the stream a d bike riding.Inside it was good fun for the kids and very educational. However the real disappointment was the activity area where kids can build their own things with all the props that have. It would have been great if it wasn't for the very unhelpful assistants who seemed more concerned about packing up to get off at 4pm. When asked by our kids for help or suggestions their answers we're brief, not interested in helping and simply just ""don't bother me go work it out yourself"".The experience could have been better.",onep39
40,Fun for very young children,"The attractions are best suited to 3 - 7 year olds. Be sure to bring swimsuit and water shoes so they can play in the stream as that's a real favorite here. And go with friends or a group. All of the activities are more fun that way -- We can visit something like the Science Center or the Getty and enjoy everything together, but this play place is meant just for the kids. Adults should be prepared to watch from the sidelines while their tots ride tricycles or play in the stream.",Karie T
50,We love Kidspace,"Kidspace is a hands on indoor outdoor children's museum for children ages 0-maybe 9. My 4 and 6 year old have been coming for years and still find it fun. We spend many visits in the physics outdoor space, the lazy river, green house, and indoor creature exhibits. We have yet to try out their newest exhibit indoors. The area is very friendly for families. Membership can now be purchased at different levels. We purchased the 6 month membership since we mostly go in the summer months and we have visited 4-5 times now.",DawnGJ
50,Always a great time at Kidspace.,As a pass holder it makes it convenient to stop in on a whim. My daughter enjoys the many activities they offer. The activities are endless and they have a summer concert series as well. Check the website for details.,Willieboxing
50,Young grandchildren's visit,"Kidspace is a wonderful place for a visit with young children (under 8). There's lots of space for running around, riding carts and tricycles and walls to climb on or hide behind as well as turtles to visit The indoor activities are well laid out and challenging with lots of hands-on fun to be had.",cahrcgjpc
30,Not really for kids over 7 years of age!,My son is 9 and a half and this place would have been perfect a few years ago. Remember to take clothes and shoes to get wet in. It was 33 dollars for two adults and one child and we were done in about 30 minutes.,gigibov
50,Great for kids,I am a local. We were here with our 9 yr old daughter and kids church group on free family night. The entire family gets in free every first Tuesday of the month 4-8pm. Our daughter had a great time. As parents we can't complaint when it's FREE! I would not recommend coming without kids.,Normeee
30,Good for Kids,"If you are not accompanying kids, this museum will not be very interesting. Nor will your visit be pleasant.",TerrywHamilton
30,They need to maintain and repair this place,"I have been here several times with young children. It has a lot to offer, but just now there are attractions outside which are broken, weeds growing, areas of dirt that are not attractive. I think they need to get in there, and repair things, put a bit of money into landscaping and fix it up.",Debbie C
50,Fun,New physic center is awesome and worth the trip...cafe has a good Chinese chicken saladFree parking and great time for the kids!,travelshooter71
50,Fun interactive museum for younger kids,"Absolutely love this place. Very age appropriate for my 3 girls aged 6, 5, and 2. First off there are no parking fees and the entrance costs are inexpensive. Being part of the children's museums reciprocal network gives us a 50% discount on the entry fees.The physics forest is pretty awesome.  I love how each interactive area gives a detailed explanation on how things work. The big girls loved all of the activities. Even the two year old had a few things to keep her busy.  I really like that they have a toddler room for kids 4 and under.  The trike course was fun.  Thank God they use coffee filters to put inside the helmets for the kids. Some kids got out of control on the course. I even saw one kid ram into a sign. It might be better if they had a little more guidance in this area. The fossil show was informative. The girls love talking about dinosaurs and it was nice for them to see fossils in real life. my wife really liked the bees. Very cool to see them at work tending to their queen.I could go on and on about all the cool things to do for the kids.  Everyone really had an awesome time.",tygerstile
50,great kids place,"So the munchkin and I went to an awesome fun little event put on by the USC Trojan Alumni club of the SGV facebook.com/USCClubSGV A few friends also were able to make it out and lots of children and other members of the Alumni club were also there.So we all got in for free so I am not sure what the cost is, however there are a ton of things to do here. Exploration with insects, tunnels, physics, etc. The munchkin and a few of her friends were going non stop for several hours. Then they shut the Museum down =\ None the less the extensive play time and exploratory time made for an awesome outing.Pro Tip: Bring your own grub/drinks so you dont have to pay three million times the proper amount for itThey have areas to draw various things. Many games. Some live animals and insects. Numerous scientific exploration activities. Giant climbing adventures and many similar items.Pro Tip #2: Dont be a jackwagon, bring your camera!It made my 6 yr old transport directly to Heaven and posted an ear to ear grin on her face, till they closed the park on us =(So many things to explore, I cant more highly suggest that you check this place out if you are anywhere near it. Absolutely one of the best kids attractions that I have made it to here in LA/OC/SD. Well worth the cost of admission.",Schel74
40,Educational and fun,"My kids are 2 and 4 and they are into bugs. This place had spiders, lizards, bees, etc. They had lots of climbing areas, fun digs, bike tracks, water features, and scientific fun activities. It's a small place but we spent half a day exploring all the sections of the museum. It is very interactive that is why my kids enjoyed it. It's like a park with lots of things to touch and play with. Definitely recommend this for kids 10 and below.",hmajuelo
50,Always an adventure,This is a wonderful place to take grandchildren and enjoy the looks of joy on their faces as they explore all the different parts of the museum. There is a nice balance of quiet spaces and very active spaces. It is helpful that there is easy parking as well.,WendyCob
50,They didn't want to leave,"Younger kids love this place. They wanted to stay and do it all. Just keep an eye out on your sun exposure, a good part of this is outdoors.",Daniel C
40,Great time for my two sons,I liked the outdoor exhibits and activities for my boys - ages 5 and 7. They could learn science and have fun at the same time. In the back was a water area and even a small rock climbing wall. I would go there again.,dougie711
40,Small place with lots of features,Maybe this place is best suited for children below 10. But the science based activities can also be fun and interesting for older ones.,Mauka_Ohana
40,Kidspace Children's Museum Not Only for Kids,"Kidspace was designed for kids, but as adults, my husband and I found lots to like and admire - and watch the children enjoy themselves. This museum inspires kids to play in unique ways, explore the Haunted House, learn from the Critter Expo, unleash an earthquake, feed giant bugs, craft art, climb raindrops 40' in the air, as well as have a sensory experience through touch, smell, hear, taste and sight. Plan on spending several hours here. The admission is reasonable and well worth the money and your time.",Arline Zatz
50,a place for both fun & education,"first i doubted to go there with my 2,5 years old, because i thought he was to young for a museum. but when i went there i changed my mind because it's not only an educational but also a very fun place to go. there is a looooooot for children to do there. even the educational part that is for bigger kids is interesting for small ones - just to look how things move etc. for the very little ones there is a special room for playing, there is also a very nice river (but the water is cold - and my son got sick after that), to play (so be sure to take a little bucket with you. there is a cafe inside, a shop, restrooms, outdoor and indoor activities... pretty much everything to spend a whole of half of the day there.",Mariana V
50,Pumpkin Featival Fun!!,"My family and I drove out from Palm Springs for the kids to enjoy themselves! This weekend happened to be the Pumpkin Festival and it was not only half off admission, but the pumpkin festival was so much fun! The festival is only this weekend, so get there early!! We have a 6y, 5y, 3y & 5 month old and there was so much to do!! Take an extra set of clothing cause they do have the option to get wet! The water is only on from 11-3 to conserve water. The Pumpkin Festival was free, you just have to buy the tickets for kids to play games and do arts and crafts. The food also cost tickets and I must say, the food was really delicious! We had the pulled pork nachos (9 tickets = $9, pretty pricey huh? The Teriyaki Chicken bowls were $6 not bad) and the games varied between 1-3 tickets. If you plan to go sometime after this weekend here is a coupon to get $3 off.http://www.readysetgrowla.org/coupons-partners/kidspace.html(It must be printed to be valid.)So have fun and enjoy!!!",Ivan and Kristi... R
50,Fun for my kids ages 3 and 5,"Everyone in our group had a fun time. It is not a huge space so grandma could easily walk around with us (unlike the LA Zoo which takes a lot of walking). The ""Physics Forest"" is super cool for me, an engineer, but also was fun for the kids. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable. I plan to go back.",mbarre715
40,My son loved it here,This is a great place to visit right by the Rose Bowl. So many things for kids to see and do. We went when it was a bit warm out and there were water features that kids could play in. It's really inexpensive too and they offer a year pass if you live in the area and would like to come more frequently.,UGoOli
50,A little bit of kid's play,Set in the outskirts of Brookside Park near the Rose Bowl and next to the actual field Jackie Robinson played in as a boy with his brother Mack give the Museum a historical value. Kids and adults will both enjoy the variety of activities available.,laroxdude
40,Affordable for yearly membership or one time visit,If typy have kids under ten years old there is so much fun to be had at kidspace.I had a six month membership and it more than paid for itself over that period of time.,Rudy C
50,A great place for kids,There is so much to do. I just let my 7 year old grandson go wherever he wants. It's educational in a very playful and interesting way.,PenelopeinPasadena
50,Lots of Fun & Learning,"Took 2 of my grandchildren, ages 4 1/2 and 2 1/2 here. We had a great time . They enjoyed climbing up the big towers. There was an opportunity to paint and we experimented with mixing colors. They especially enjoyed the Arroyo, where they waded in the stream and got soaked! There were also trikes to ride and water table to play with. the new Physics Forrest was great and we learned all kid of things, enjoyed launching many balls. Bring a change of clothes because they will get wet and wear water friendly shoes (like Crocs). Free parking is a plus and there is a park for picnicking with climbing toys and slides nearby.",Hikerbear2
50,Perfect Place--Kids Under 10,"Great day with our grandson age 2.5! Many children's museums say they are ""hands on"" and aren't! Every activity here is fun and really hands on, so children can get involved themselves without adults explaining what to do. A special inside play area for those under age 4 is the best I've ever seen. Easy water activities, like shooting water guns at drum heads to make music; a small stream going downhill designed for wading; and water shoots coming up to run under, plus many more add to the fun. Bring a towel, a change of clothes and watershoes and let them run! Staff was available at every area to answer questions. Kid-friendly food like juice boxes, smoothies, pizza of all sizes and more is available, within a comfortable seating area of umbrella tables. We'll be back!!!",Mary Ann B
50,Kidspace Children's Museum,We took our granddaughter. This is an excellent trip for the curious child and one who loves to discover and play! Great place.,skminn
50,Bring Towels,"Kidspace keeps getting better and better. They have a new area for arts and crafts with very patient young people assisting children in making a project. We took three grand children on a Saturday, ages 7 and two three year olds. We spent nearly four hours there. It was a hot day so we let them wear swimsuits and brought towels-big water play area in back with a creek and buckets to play with. Plus squirting water features in the area by the snack bar. Physics forest is great for older kids. Lots of hands on stuff and there is a big area in the shade with big foam bricks and connectors -easily done by a three year old. It can be difficult to keep track of kids here, so one to one for small children is advised. The food line at the cafe is long and the food is not that great, I brought bottled water and snacks. Admission is eleven bucks per person-no matter what age. Worth every penney. They were all asleep by 7pm!",lascola
50,Excellent Place for Kids to Go and Explore,We have two kids now. A 2 and a half year old and a 1 year old. We have been going here since our sone was about 18 months old or so. They have a room designed for the little youngsters 2 and under and several hands on attractions for the 2+ kids to explore. Its a beautiful place right next to the Rose Bowl.I must say also that their food is really good!A nice stop for any traveler with young kids to take a break in the area. And of course a great place to go for us locals.,PapiJohn
50,The Mini-Arroyo,"I love the outdoor aspects of KidSpace, esp the ""mini-arroyo"". Take extra clothes and crocs or water shoes and let your kids go at it... They also have ""free nights"" so if you are in town check the dates and see if they are open late, and it may be free. Don't get stuck inside, there are great activities outside that many people miss.",CAZADOR
50,A Must if You Have Kids,"This place is great for mostly kids under 10 years of age. Such a great place for the family to go. Many educational spots to explore and play. Can easily spend 3 hours in there and still much to explore. Admission is pretty good, do search for discount deals before heading there. I looked up a $3 off discount online, so admission was only $8 per person.",cranqee66
50,A great time!,"I took my children last week to the Children's Museum. They spent six hours running, playing and climbing. One of my daughters fell asleep before we left the parking lot. The parking is free and the price is $11 dollars per person. I have paid almost 30 dollars for overnight parking before so in my opinion the price for admission is a real deal! Tips....Bring a change of clothes for the children because it's hard to keep them out of the water activities.",Twinkiesdaddy
50,Wonderful for a visit or a birthday party,"I have had the pleasure of going to Kidspace a number of times; first with the children of a friend and then with my granddaughter. Being there never disappoints, no matter what the child you are with has in mind for the day. We also had a birthday party there and I have never seen so many captivated 2 year olds in one place before. Games, critters, crafts, and lots of fun for children of any age.",karynrn52
50,Our Granddaughter's Favorite Place,"We bought a Kidspace family membership about 3 years ago--as soon as our granddaughter was walking. We take her to KidSpace a couple times a month and she never tires of it. Whether it's quiet play in the ""Little Kids' Room"" or story time, or music time, or exploring the stream on the hillside, meeting Tortellini the turtle, crawling down the ant hole, or trying new things in the ""Physics Forest"", she always enjoys the visits. It's a place for kids to learn, explore, be with other children, and enjoy themselves -- good for all ages from crawling babies to elementary school age. They have a small cafe with really good food for kids and adults(served outdoors) too.",Mary M
40,Fun place for the littles.,"Lots to explore here for the kiddos, just wish they had more for the under 3 tots. Went on a very busy day and my 15month old who can climb, walk, run, was practically run over by the 4 and ups!Really cool outside experimental set-ups for the older kids to enjoy.",bfigueroa18
50,Loved it!!,"I recently visited LA with my 5 year old daughter. We took a day out to visit Pasadena and had a lovely time.The museum is set in the grounds of the Rose Bowl; and during our visit they were decorating the floats for the Rose Parade! The museum has plenty of indoor and outdoor attractions and is far superior to the childrens museums I have been to in NYC. The facilities are very clean and the attractions numerous. My daughter enjoyed the outdoor science experiments, the bike track, the bug kitchen/diner and the snow exhibit.If you visit Pasadena, check out the Pasadena Playhouse. When we were there they had an English Panto of Alladin which we both loved.",CushyNYC
30,Snow day is a flop!,If your child is 6 and under this might be a fantastic experience. I was excited to bring my 11 year old to snow days. It's advertised as a great place to come and play in the snow. They say you can build a snowman or make snow angels. What and exaggeration! The space is the size of a postage stamp and if you laid down to make an angel you would get stomped on . Great for toddlers maybe?,paris c
50,Explore the world of Science through a childs eye...,We came for a birthday party. We planned on going earlier to explore the museum. We'll definitely come back! The kids enjoyed tinkering at the Galvin Physics Forest and the Digging Deeper Gallery. The party was also fun for the kids with the games and interaction with small animals. I learned that they have different interactive activities all year round. A definite go to for those with young kids!,tameia
50,Great for the kids!!,Kidspace is a great place for the kids. It's nothing really big and fancy and it is really inexpensive to go. There are plenty of scientific activities to do outside as well as inside. A lot of hands on entertainment and learning. The children will have. There is also a little part where water shoots up from the ground so if your child loves water bring extra clothes to change into. There are lockers to hold your extras. Overall fun for everyone and the staff is really nice and helpful.,Shani B
50,Fun for kids,This is really a neat place to take the kids! Lots of fun and learning. Well rounded place. Plan on taking 3-4 hours,travelshooter71
40,A good place for older children,"We went with a toddler and there wasn't a great deal for the under 4's. For anyone older though, it's a good place to study outdoor science. A slight disadvantage is that indoor space with air-con is limited, and even the staff were feeling the heat when we went. There are (I think) unnecessary rules about small children having to wear clothes and shoes when in the water features, but that could be just a prurient attitude. The outer park area is also good for children to run around in, but I am personally of the opinion that all car parks should be naturally planted with trees for shade.",Teacupcake
50,Kidspace! A Fun and Interactive Family Experience!,"I wish I had Kidspace when I was a kid. Maybe I would have been more into science. What a fun place to learn how things work. The whole park is an interactive learning experience. Ben Franklin said, “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.” Kidspace involves everyone in the learning process, from toddlers to teens, and even adults.All of the exhibits teach something from the “Water Vortex” where you can see a whirlpool created to “The Dig” where kids can take discover dinosaurs and uncover fossils. That’s just scratching the surface of the many fun activities…the Butterfly Garden, Wisteria Climber, Bugsy’s Diner, Water Symphony and Splash Dance. Yes, there are water features so you might bring a change of clothes, a towel and water shoes. They do have lockers.Kidspace Museum is a great location for a unique birthday party and for groups. In the summer, if you live the LA/Pasadena environs, they also have a day camp and workshops.Great for locals and a must-stop activity for visitors!",reparatamazzola
50,Fantastic Field Trip!,"Attention all you early childhood educators! This museum is an awesome field trip destination. I have been taking my little Kindergartners here for years and it is always a big hit with them.Absolutely everything here is ""hands-on"". They can explore the cool indoor spaces; insects, ant hill, climbing towers, live bees, etc. Outside there are gardens, arroyos, more climbing opportunities and the really terrific Physics Forest which just opened. So much fun!! They also offer free interactive presentations daily about the life of ants and bees. This place really understands how young children learn and they do an outstanding job in every way! Kudos to Kidspace!",TLFLosAngeles
50,Magical Place for Children,"A great destination for families with children under 10. Many fun activities for children in all different age groups, and many opportunities for learning and mental growth. Excellent and helpful staff. A great place for a few hours, or even a half day or more. Very good snack bar on premises. Some very good special evening programs. A great place to hold a kids' birthday event. Membership highly recommended for those living with easy driving distance.",PDEYES
50,Great way to spend a day with kids,New physics forest is really engaging. Great place for kids from toddlers to about 10 or 11years old. Membership is pretty pricey however for occasional visits with grandparents it is a bargain. Lots of hands on and physical activity science based.,lascola
50,Great place to go and you dont have to spend $ either,"There is a great park adjoining this venue, and sometimes our son just hangs out there. Also the cafe and public restrooms are accessible without admission to Kidspace Museum. Just dont go on any football or Rose Bowl fleamarket weekend! The museum itself is great and age appropriate for 2-12. Our son had his 3rd birthday party there also, recommend that.",kimparklee
40,My daughter loves it,We live about 40 minutes away and we have a membership. The place is great for kids of all ages. The woter works are the best part. My daughter loves playing in the creek!,Platanos
20,What a disappointment,"FAcility felt small and poor kempt at the time that we visited. The floor was dirty and the number of children running ""free"" felt uncomfortable.Really not my cup of tea, nor was it for my daughter who wanted out in less than 1/2 hour.",Sonny
40,Great Spot for Children on the Younger Side,There is lots to do for the younger children here and one could easily spend 2-3 hours letting them try out lots of different activities.,thewindatourfeet
40,"Fun, Active and Wet","This is a fun place for younger children. A lot of things for the kids to see, play and do. Definitely bring a change of clothes...they will get wet. Price is not too bad, look for coupons that bring it down a few dollars (we found ours on readysetgrowla.org). Downside, when school groups attend, your little one might have to wait a while before they get their turn. Also, really not enough room to eat at their concession stand....bring your own and have a picnic in the park just outside. Plenty of free parking.",Gerry D
50,I needed a place to take my kids because I didn't want to spend 125.00 a ticket for Universal Studios.,"Kids Space was a blast for them, now this is for young kids, not Tweens or teens. My 8 year old was in heaven on all the play structures and he got into the science side of things on his own. Which was interesting considering when I want him to look at something he runs the other way. My five year old was running to keep up with the 8 year old. The park was well staffed, well maintained, and the people were nice all around us. A great place to spend a day with your kids.",charmainecarnes
40,Fun & educational for younger children,My children (ages 6 & 9) loved it here. It's meant for younger kids. It is something fun to do in and can see and do everything in 2 to 3 hours. There is a concession stand on site so you can buy food there if you prefer but I did see parents bring food and picnic outside in the park that surrounds the venue.,sricciardiandgang
40,can't go wrong with a children's museum,"great place for family and with your children. Check for special event on their website for any addition fun, enjoy.",kitty-hello
40,very good for kids 5-7 years!!,"i went here and it was great! it was a little too young for my age group (9-12ish), but i saw a lot of other kids having a good time. there snack bar thing that serves lunch and ice cream.there is a physics park where there are so many hands on attractions that ar fun and informative! the staff is for sure kid-friendly and they teach you kid physics in a way that is easy to understand!",Sophie M
50,Kidspace was a winner!!,"This was an enjoyable place to bring the grand kids, ages 6 and 2. The parking is free and it only cost $50.00 for five of us for the day. Do bring a change of clothes because there is water fun.",Maryjane10893
50,Awsome place for little ones,"Very fun, hands on museum for little kids. The new location near rosebowl is a lot of fun and the outside area is beautiful",Helena M
40,Fun place for the kids,"I recently took my two nieces, age 3 and 18 months to Kidspace. I only get to see my nieces a few times a year and wanted to make sure we had a good time, so I read a lot of reviews. I read both good and bad reviews and decided to take a leap and head over to the museum. I was a bit nervous expecially being that it would be a total of 5 of us and wanted to make sure we didn't waste our time and money. A lady outside gave me a coupon she got on-line, so that made things even better for us. Kids that are from 3-6 years old would probably get the most out of this museum , give or take a year. My nieces got more out of the outdoor activities including the water guns which hit drums and musical instruments, the river and watermill, and the tricycles. They did not especially like the insect displays and infact were a bit scared of them, however I can see that some kids would like the displays. I do think that this place could have more to offer for the admission price. I read this in another review, and will admit that the girls loved the playgrounds outside the museum which were free, so if budget is a concern then I would do that. However, if you get a coupon and want the kids to see something new for about 3 hours, then I think it is worth it. If you live in the area, than maybe a season pass would make more sense. My nieces are from out of state, so that wasn't an option for us, however I talked with some parents and that is what they do.",TravelinRG
50,A Fun Interactive Museum for Young Children,"This is a fun, entertaining place to spend a day with young children. I'd recommend it to anyone with kids from ages 2 to 7 or so.Pros: Great interactive science exhibits. My 3 and almost 5 year olds loved digging for dinosaur fossils, seeing the live insects and beehive, climbing the indoor platforms, doing the floor puzzles and riding the tricycles. This is a great museum for the little ones, who prefer hands-on activities to a traditional museum. The kids also loved the water play in the river and playing the drums with the water jets. As previously noted, be sure to bring a change of clothes and water friendly shoes. The staff does monitor shoe usage and will ask you to remove your child from the water if they see that your child has removed your shoes. Ample parking and clean bathrooms are also a plus. Location by the grassy play area can be a plus or a minus (your kids might not want to go into the museum after they see the grassy play area first).Cons: A little bit pricey at $10 per person (adults and children) as of July 2012, and food at the cafe is not too appetizing and a bit pricey (almost $7 for a burger or pizza) and $2 for a drink, but hey if you're like me you're not there for the food, you're eating there for the convenience, so I won't complain too much. It was VERY crowded on a Sunday (we were there from about 11am to 3pm and the place was packed) and hard to find outdoor seating to eat. I am glad that they provided helmets for the tricycle riders, but the floor by the water jet area was very slippery and I saw children repeatedly running in the area, slipping, and hitting their heads on the slippery asphalt. My child also slipped and fell walking but she was OK, she only landed on her bottom, but others were not as lucky. I would recommend watching your children closely by the water areas. Other places like Sea World and Legoland have a rubber mat material near water play areas to avoid slips and falls like this. So I'd subtract a half star for that.All in all, I'd recommend this museum to parents of young children. It's a wholesome, educational way to spend an afternoon and your kids will have a blast. Just remember that change of clothes!",orchid_blossom

50,Lovely museum to visit,"Thnaks to tripadvisor we found this museum for our recent trip to LA.Both our kids, 1 and 3, had a wonderful time, as did the adults.A really fun place for kids to spend the day at a really reasonable price!",Elliot1984
50,I wish I was a kid again,"I love coming here. It's large, open, safe, and every time I go with my family someone cries because we have to leave. There are things to do for children in all age groups.",MarketingDiva
50,Wonderful place for young children!,"We arrived at kidspace museum, which is located in the parking lot of the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, at about 10am. We walked through a park, which had plenty of open grassy areas for picnics and games, and a big tot lot for the adventurous kids. They have a little splash pad in the courtyard, before you enter the building. I was not prepared and did not have any wet shoes or bathing suits for my kids. I would highly recommend brining them...they also have a creek in the back where kids can play in the water! There were a lot of things for the kids to do...a lot of climbing equipment/activities, tricycle track, bugs to look at, arts and crafts, water drums, and presentations. We spent 4 hours there and enjoyed a picnic in the park for lunch (we supplied our own food, but they do have a cafe there too). On our way out we enjoyed popsicles. And of course, the kids were passed out in the back seat from all the energy expelled...a great sign of a wonderful time. We will definitely be back again some day!",jdichosa
50,Really fun- wear crocs!,This is a great place to take the kids! There is a fun water play area so I highly recommend a bathing suit and crocs so everyone can fully enjoy it!,chrish574
30,"Needs a little sprucing, but still fun for the kids","Too far of a drive from Orange County, but if you're a local, its worth the trip. More to do there during the summer (water play). I like the mix of indoor/outdoor activities.",loriv247
50,KIDSPACE MUSEUM = FANTASTIC FUN FOR FAMILIES,"We buy an annual membership to use when our grandchildren come to town. They love it. There is something for children of all ages, including an infant-toddler room. There are scheduled special events and musical performances. On one of our visits they had a petting zoo and on another, snow to play in.The gift shop is a great place to shop for unique gifts for children. There is a small counter to order food, but you are also not prohibited from bringing your own to eat at the outdoor tables.My grandkids love playing in the water and there are plenty of opportunities for that.Just make sure their shoes can get wet and bring a change of clothes.This is a unique and joyful place for children to explore and learn by using all their senses.",Konstandena
50,Worth getting their membership,"We had a couple of trips planned to LA and decided getting a 6 month membership would be cost-effective. It sure was. My kids (ages 7 and 4) love this place. There's not a huge variety of activities if you go often, but for kids it's perfect. They can navigate the space and won't get overwhelmed with too much to do.Oh and I enjoyed the chef salad too at their cafe.After hanging out at KidSpace, you can let your kids burn off more energy at the playground near the parking lot.",Lib3
50,"Kidspace Museum is a must stop if visiting Pasadena, CA",Kidspace Museum in Pasadena is hands on the best kid’s museum in Southern California. All year round you can find different activities for kids to engage on. My 4 year old absolutely love this place!,wen2010LA

50,Great summer fun!,"My husband and I took our three boys (ages 4.5, and twin 19 mos) to Kidspace last week. They all had so much fun!!! We started off with lunch at the cafe there - the food was very good, but it took a long time to get it (about 20-30 min)... Frustrating for the little ones! We then explored all the exhibits inside - bugs, climbing, painting, art projects, etc. The twins were not as entertained indoors as my 4 yr old. We then went outside to the water play area which was fantastic entertainment for hours! There was a toddler play area that allows the kids to explore with buckets, pouring water in various spots and watching what happens. We then went to the man-made river - which the kids loved! It is very shady with lots of trees. Be warned, though, shoes must be worn at all times - water shoes would be best. There are some gardens near the river which are really great for the kids to explore and see where their food comes from!There was an area with tricycles and helmets for the kids to ride, but we didn't get that far as we spent too much time everywhere else! I am sure there is more that we didn't get time to do, but we will be back! My only other caution (besides the slow cafe food) would be that I am not sure it would have been quite as fun if it had been too cool for all the water play. That was definitely my kids favorite part by far!",MChildress
50,Kidspace is a great place,"My son is 2 and a half and we were looking for an active experience - boy did we get one at Kidspace. The exhibits are all interactive and are designed for kids aged 2-(probably 8). There are art areas, climbing structures, an ant tunnel, an earthquake simulator and a""construction zone"" with large blocks. The outdoor waterplay areas are my son's favorites (water tables in the play-yard, a musical symphony station with waterguns that shoot drums and a man-made, but very natural looking stream with two pools. Bring a full change of clothes and water shoes for both of you - you'll definitely want to wade in the outdoor stream with your kids (and will have to go in with younger kids to keep them from slipping on the rocks). There's also a great trike path with bikes and helmets for those old enough to ride. There are outdoor climbing walls and cages made of simulated branches, an ampitheater for live performances and, yes, a very nice cafe. We got a 6 month pass and have been there 3 times (each time for 3-4 hours) and still haven't done everything! The gift shop has great educational toys, games and books.",toddlermom93
50,Great fun! My kids loved it!,"I needed to find something do with my 6 and 3 year olds, while big brother (7)attended camp nearby at Occidental College. Since I am from out of town, I just looked up things to do with kids in Pasadena and found this place. We lOVED it! I have been to several children's museums with my kids, but this place is definitely the best. The staff was friendly, the place was clean, the outdoor play area was full of water friendly activities for the kids to enjoy (take an extra change of clothes, your kids WILL get wet!) The most amazing part was that the food court offered GREAT food at a reasonable price--although they did forget to make our order, the ""waitress"" was extremely apologetic and brought over our food immediately once she realized a mistake had been made. My kids did not want to leave, and we spent 5 hours there! We are going back tomorrow!!",francineb
50,My kids loved this place!,"We had gone to Kidspace recently and my kids ages 3,4 and 5 loved it! They have a playroom for kids under 2, a building with climing structures for older kids like from 5 to 10 years of age. Outside they have a water table which my 3 year old son loved and spent pretty much all day there. My 5 year old son loved riding the tricycles around the painted paths. And my 4 year old son just loved walking around with me and exploring the museum.. There is food available as well as lockers to rent and a small gift shop. You may want to bring a change of clothes for your kids because water is a big part of this museum. It's not a big museum but you can still spend a few hours there. It's located within a park and right outside of the museum is a kid's playground where you can have a picnic as well. Parking is plenty and free. My kids had a great time! I'm not sure if the older kids would enjoy it as much. They probably would just like the climbing structures. I hope you have a great time!",exhaustedmomma
