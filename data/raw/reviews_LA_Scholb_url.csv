50,Great Beer and Ambiance,"We tried this on the way home from a long drive and it was just the right thing. Big selection of beer types even tho they advertise ales. Nice folks, great visiting BBQ outside so you could have lunch or dinner too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Av8trx90277
50,Fun Torrance Microbrewery,"We had a fun afternoon tasting beers at Scholb Brewery in Torrance. We tried four beers and our favorites were the So Cal Blonde and the Dark Void Stout. The warehouse has a cool vibe, very fun, has tables, bars and a lounge area with sofas. They serve a couple food items, but they also allow you to bring in your own food. It would be fun to have lunch there. They have a couple games, and some guys had the tallest Jenga tower that I've ever seen someone build.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joycie0274
