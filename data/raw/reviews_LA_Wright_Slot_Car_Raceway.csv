40,Really fun place to burn some time. Adults and mature kid fun!,"You can bring your own car or you can rent them. The tracks are really fun and challenging. Not really a great place for small kids, but bring your tweens on up! Lots of fun. The guy who runs the place is very gracious. Bring a spotter, so when the cars go off track you can gently place them back on the track for lots of racing time. Highly recommend you come check it out.",Sojournarita
40,Family Fun!,"This is an indoor activity that would be great for a family experience when it's too hot or rainy to be outside. They have two electric slot car tracks and you can rent, buy or bring your own car and controller. The raceway is clean and the operator was professional. We were there on a Friday afternoon and it was wonderful to see the families arriving to race together as we were leaving that evening. They can host birthday parties too!",CrankingChick
