50,Exercise and Sightseeing all in One,"Could have ridden more and further, but mainly rode our rentals from Annenburg House down to Venice Pier and back. Stopped for lunch, stopped to watch the Skaters at the Skate park too. Well maintained, easy to see directional markings so walkers, skateboarders and scooters know all where to be and who gets right of way. Never saw an accident, although gotta watch out for little kids o occasion darting out in front of you in their hurry to get to the swing set or the beach lol. You may also need to occasionally watch out for the serious bikers on the trail, the ones who like to really cruise past you expecting you to move out of their way. Also prepare yourself for some second hand MJ smoke. Ran through a few clouds of it, and while it doesnt bother me at all, ;), it may bother some.Next tiem I plan on heading down to marina Del Rey and up to Malibu.",Rick D

50,This changed my view of Los Angeles,"I have been all over the world. 50+ countries, all 50 states, 9 of the 10 Canadian provinces. I was in Los Angeles in 1993 as a kid and remembered loving San Francisco, but hating LA. Those were the smog days. Still, I was 12 have and had little memories of the place.Maybe 4 years ago, we took a trip to Santa Barbara where we briefly passed through Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, but again, we were headed out of here.This last month, I have had two different day long stays between flights at LAX, and and on both occasions we rented bikes and did the South Bay. The first time, we started at Hermosa Beach and rode north past the power plant, around Marina Del Rey to Venice Beach. Today, we started in Santa Monica and road north to the end, then back south to Venice. I must say, I am not a big fan of Venice Beach. I am a pretty liberal guy, but in parts, it was just a bunch of people stoned, and the smell of pot was ubiquitous. But that aside, this is just an American gem in my mind. A beautiful 20 mile beachfront bike trail that makes me wish I lived in Southern California after previously having thought this was just an entertainment industry traffic jam. We'll be back soon to enjoy this, not just as a layover.",Jimmy L

50,26 miles of joy,"You like to bike and soak in the ocean? This is the place. Start out in Venice and Santa Monica and ride south. You will need a map to figure out the Venice portion when you leave the beach for a moment, but it is not hard. Stop in Manhattan Beach or Hermosa to get a beer or lunch, and keep on riding. You end at Redondo beach and that really is the end - straight uphill from there. The trip back is especially dramatic at Sunset.",Sgrdn3

40,A great way to will away the day,"Having the Bike path right at the door step to our Hotel was a absolute blessing. Not only was it great to bike up to and beyond Venice Beach it was a great place to people watch. SoCal has such a diversely interesting population that you get a chance to meet some of the most colourful people on the planet, little shops appear along the Boardwalk so you can just get off you bike and take in all the culture. You do need to watch out for sand and half asleep tourist however so you need to constantly keep an eye out. We found that cycling first thing in the morning was the most enjoyable because it was nice and quiet and the temperature was reasonable too.(My apologies if this is a repeat review).",BreezeRidge3

Most people we encountered adhered to the signs, but we did keep an eye out for the odd fast approaching bike or skate board!",Pip-F1

Be prepared to share the path with roller blades, runners, walkers and small kids on bikes wobbling along and super fast cyclist whizzing by you, this is not always the most relaxing ride but its always scenic. On weekends, go early in the day if you crave solitude. Start as far north as the Palisades and bike to Manhattan Beach, bring a lock and park your bike at the pier, walk up the street and find lunch, coffee or sweet treats!",Terri S

It is fun to ride it with a group of friends and make stops to eat and see the sites.It is a good bike workout when there are no people around. i.e. very early in the mornings.

40,Popular cycle path for cruising the beaches,We cycled this very popular path on a Sunday afternoon and it was fun even though it was very busy. We made a longer trip midweek from Santa Monica pier pastMarina Del Ray towards Long Beach and back. This was a more chilled out experience and there was less fending off required. Bike hire is $20 to $30 a day. Make sure you note your hire company's telephone number if you plan a longer trip as the bikes aren't in great repair and you might need help. Note that state law requires minors to wear a helmet.,Well_travelled_Dad

50,Great Ride in the Morning,"Local biker and I think that the beach ride is a gem.If you want to ride distances, the morning is your best bet because the people are not out and walking on the beach yet.Venice Beach is one place to be especially careful because they don't seem to sweep the path, there are lots of sandy curves, and people don't stay off the bike path.The rest of the 20-plus miles are fantastic.",BrianFromMcFarland
50,Magnificent oceanside ride.,"One bike ride you never get tired of. It begins or ends at Torrance Beach, which is almost at the edge of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, and runs along the ocean for 21 miles to the north end of Santa Monica. The most beautiful beaches in the State are on one side of this cement path, and rows of magnificent beachside homes are on the other side.The path is used for biking, inline skating, jogging, and walking. The stretch going through Manhattan Beach has two side-by-side paths---one for walking and jogging and the other for biking and skating. Some of the towns you will go through, starting from the north, are Santa Monica, Venice, Marina Del Rey, Playa Del Rey, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach. There are many great restaurants along the way, and much to do. For example, on a hot day I like to ride for a half hour or so, then cool off in the ocean, then bask in the sun for a half hour, then continue with my ride. Along the way I might watch a volleyball game. There are more than 60 courts just in Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach. Contact me if you want to see some online photos of the area and the bike path.",Sightseer22714
