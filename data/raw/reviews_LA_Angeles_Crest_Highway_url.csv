50,pleasantly quiet drive that feels a million miles away from LA,"Take your time and enjoy this pleasantly quiet drive. Make sure to include the 5 mile detour from Red Box Gap to the Wilson Observatory to get those amazing views over LA. We did the drive on a dry and warm day so there was no issue with snow and ice but it would be worthwhile checking conditions before attempting the drive. It is long and windy and not at all busy on weekdays (so not a lot of help if you’d get stuck). There are lots of hiking and picnic opportunities along the way. We started early from Wrightwood, hiked the Windy Gap trail, made it in good time to for sunset at the Observatory and finished off driving into the glittering lights of the City of Angeles. Awesome.",Ntalabany

There are scenic stops everywhere, and plenty of places to park, picnic, hike and camp. Highlights include the Mount Wilson Observatory and Newcomb's Ranch Roadhouse. A spectacular drive with lots to do throughout.",Jay661
50,What a Drive!,"We drove the stretch between Wrightwood and La Canada Flintridge a total of four times on a recent trip . This road is an absolute treasure and should be considered a ""must drive"" for driving enthusiasts. On one weekday morning we saw a total of seven vehicles in the middle 50-mile stretch -- it's quite secluded, which adds to its majesty.The speed limit is mostly 55 MPH, and the curvy nature of the road means one can enjoy a spirited drive without reaching license-threatening speeds. Most drivers we encountered courteously pulled over to allow speedier cars through.",Robert R

50,Amazing Drive,"IF YOU HAVE A LOWERED CAR, DON'T DRIVE THIS OR TURN AROUND WHEN YOU SEE SNOW. When you start seeing snow, there are generally relatively large rocks on the road. Luckily my lancer GTS isn't dropped and has a relatively high stock height so I was able to barely clear them, but several times I had to swerve into the other lane to avoid the rock slides on the road (thank you no traffic). I encountered this maybe halfway up highway 2, and it seems to be also when 80% of the people dissapear. This route is fun and can be done with those with lowered cars, you just won't go all the way up or you have to finish at La Canada as that way you won't be driving along the rocky sides.I did this drive all the way from start to end of highway 2 starting at la canada and going up. My mission was simple, speed and get sick photos of my car. Yes roll your eyes at my stupid youthfulness. Anyhow, it seems that going down had a lot more traffic when I went but there are a ton of motorcycles and people with tuner cars taking pictures. The views are absolutely amazing and it's probably the closest you can get to snow either to show your kids for some cute photos or car photos in my case. I highly recommend this drive if you enjoy cars and windy roads!",europeanperson
50,Must do Drive!,"Must do Drive! Began in La Canada Flintridge and goes to the Antelope Valley. Very few straight always and plenty of curves. Take a rest break at Mount Wilson and visit the iconic telescopes and enjoy the view over Los Angeles and on a clear day perhaps Catalina Island. Continue on passing Red Box and have a picnic at Chilao Flats. Do not rush the drive. It's not an ultra marathon. Climb Mount Baden Powell, perhaps an all day hike, but fantastic. Soon you will descend into the Antelope Valley. Buy peaches in Pearblossom or stop at Charlie Browns Farm for a milk shake. The big decision is to backtrack over the mountains again or take Highway 14 home.",Cavydad
40,Want to get out of the city???,"This is a WONDERFUL drive that goes all the way to the town of Wrightwood, CA. We went in the summer, so it wasn't like all the snow covered pictures you see, but it was still stunning and worth the drive any time of year!REMEMBER TO HAVE PLENTY OF GAS when you go!!! As it turned out we still have quite a bit of leeway, but I was getting pretty nervous. The only gas station is in Wrightwood which is about 70 miles away. I left with over half a tank, but ended up seeing my gas light on, haha. I could have gone about another 30 miles... but since it was my first time, I was nervous as I didn't know if we'd EVER get to a gas station! Haha.BEAUTIFUL views! There is a wonderful ranger's station that I stopped at about 6 miles before hitting Wrightwood. There are supposedly long horned goats up there, but we didn't see any.The town of Wrightwood I'd heard great things about, but there isn't too much to do in the town itself. Someone had said it was like Solvang, but it's not at all like that. Just a few cute things. A nice antique show, a nice ice cream shop... several restaurants.I definitely will be making this trip again!!!",Michael T
40,"Scenic Drive, But A Little Disappointing","We drove from Highland, CA to Flintridge, CA on the Rim of the World Scenic Byway (CA138) and the Angeles Crest Highway (CA2). We had been on CA138 before but this was our first time on Angeles Crest. It's a fun drive for people who like twisty-turning mountain roads, but maybe not recommended for those who get car sick or have problems with heights and steep drop-offs. We went on a Friday in May and the traffic was light, although we did have to wait a few minutes at a flagged construction zone. There are a lot of places to pull over if you like because there are many trail heads for hiking and a few picnic areas. A lot of these have restrooms and there are 2-3 visitor centers as well (open on weekends). Keep in mind that you are supposed to have an Adventure Pass if you park and use facilities. (Search online for National Forest Adventure Pass) I was surprised that there were not more scenic viewpoints. We stopped at Chilao Visitor Center because there is supposed to be a short wheelchair accessible nature trail. We knew the visitor center would be closed on Friday, but we didn't count on having to go through the visitor center to get to the trail - there is no other access. That is poor design in my opinion, limiting its use to weekends only. I was also surprised that the landscape scenery at the higher elevations was mostly rocky - I was expecting more trees. There was still some snow at the top. The road gets closed when conditions are bad so make sure it's open before you go. It was a pretty drive, but I preferred Rim of the World and also the Banning-Idyllwild Panoramic Highway (CA243) and Palms to Pines Highway (CA74) through the San Jacinto Mountains.",CrankingChick
50,drive,"This was a great, scenic drive. About thirteen years ago, I drove the entire length westbound, from Mountain top Junction at the 138 to La Canada Flintridge, California at the intersection with Foothill Boulevard. There is plenty of scenery all around.",Michael E
40,Went to find snow,"Traveled on Angeles Crest Highway on a Saturday afternoon. Started in La Canada Flintridge, to the west. I thought there was only one highway through the mountains. However, my GPS took me onto Angeles Forest Highway towards Palmdale. Had to double back. Make sure you stay on Highway 2.At 6300 feet, we found snow! It was at a little rest stop area on the way to Mt. Waterman Ski lifts. My five year old boy had fun playing in the snow. The terrain was either too steep or not steep enough for sledding, but that didn't matter. We got to build a snowman, throw snowballs, and have fun.Be sure to have a full tank of gas before you go. We saw only one restaurant and no gas stations within the forest. Above all, enjoy the view of the mountains!",GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,"Easy drive, spectacular views, fall colors!",Who knew there were fall colors to be seen in southern California?! It was a pleasant surprise to us. We just wanted to enjoy a nature drive and this route exceeded every expectation. Allow the better part of a day to do it with all the stops you'll want. Recommend heading west in the morning and east at twilight to get the best views/photos.,"Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
50,Worth a days trip,If you find yourself in the LA area and are looking for a scenic drive the Angeles Crest highway is a must. The sweeping road clings to the side of the mountains offering an 'Alpine' driving experience like few others. There are plenty of picnic areas along the way and if you want to go even further off the beaten track there are many great hikes throughout the range.,Andrew B
50,Get on up!,"I've lived in the ever increasing congestion of Los Angeles for 15 years now, but had not ventured up the Angeles Crest Hwy until this past year. And I kicked myself the whole way up and back down my first time for waiting so long to get up there! What a beautiful drive through the gorgeous Angels National Forest! There are many turn-offs that hold breath taking views, aka plenty of camera ops!. There is little to no cell reception once you climb past 3,500 feet, but who the heck do you want to be chatting with when you've got vistas to behold?! There are also several hiking trails and even a few different sections of the famous Pacific Crest Trail you can take too. Don't forget to get your day pass or have your Annual park pass in order to park there for more than any length of time. (Day pass $5, Annual pass $30.) Recently I ventured all the way across from La Canada to Wrightwood and camped at Table Mountain ($20 per night) located at 7,200ft - cold but gorgeous! We stumbled upon many trails and campsites along our journey that will bring me back to these mountains all summer. But if you're just planning a day trip, at least head up to 5,400ft to Newcomb's Ranch, which is about at the half-way point, and join the bikers for a burger!",NikiMustTravel
50,What a Beauty!! driving pleasure and Peace!!,"We did drive the California Hwy 2 from Glendale up to 138 junction in May 2016; this was the first time we did it even though we were living Pasadena for 5 years.Its a nice drive, wonderful view, good cool weather and flora and fauna. Several spots to stop and relax and view. No service no gas stations. Haramokngna American Indian Cultural center offer few drink choices on halfway.We really enjoyed our drive and recommend to any one who needs some difference and peace from rushing life.",Asoka Godawita
50,An Unknown Treasure,"I first heard of Mount Wilson on my first visit to Los Angeles when I was 14. On our first night in Pasadena I caught the sign-off KBSC-TV, channel 52 a little before 10 that evening. They mentioned that their transmitter was located on “Mount Wilson, 5,700 feet above sea level:"". Well, coming from a place where the tallest TV tower was 1,117' above sea level with most of the others much lower, this was impressive. Eight years later, on my first trip to L.A., where my parents finally let me have the rental car to myself, I finally got to drive up to Mount Wilson when I tagged along with a bunch of fellow ham radio operators to track down an unknown transmitter. I was impressed! All of the major L.A. TV and FM stations have their transmitter sites up there. And, when I went back in August 2015, there were sttll a lot of the old analog TV antennas on the short towers that are a Mount Wilson hallmark along “Video Road."" How short? More than a few are unlit! Check the web for the various websites that detail the broadcast history of Mount Wilson and show the transmitter sites up there. Do be aware that for a lot of very good reasons, the transmitter sites on Mount Wilson are securely fenced in with most of them under video surveillance from the TV stations. It is unwise to even linger. Also, if you have a cardiac pacemaker, ask your cardiologist before you make the trip to the mountain. There are many high-power transmitters up here that create some of the highest RF field levels of such a comparatively small area anywhere in North America, if not the world. There is enough RF up there to possibly throw off the operation of a pacemaker. The RF level is such that the post office up there has perhaps the shortest hours of any post office in the U.S.P.S. to limit employee exposure.But, the drive itself is awesome. If you're coming-up from Los Angeles, stop at the Shell gas station on Angeles Crest Hwy, that's just south of the 210 Foothill Freeway, and get yourself a one-day U.S. Forest Service Adventure Pass, unless you already have an annual pass or a Golden Age Adventure Pass. The Shell station is the easiest place I've found to get the pass. Hours of the rangers stations are just to variable. Just park and go into the gas station office. It's open 24X7. Do be careful turning into the place if you're coming off the Foothill Fwy and going south on Angeles Crest! That left turn across Angeles Crest can be dicey! It's only $5.00 for a one-day pass and it's needed to legally park within the forest and must be prominently displayed when you park. That includes Mount Wilson. Going-up and coming back, you'll be treated to some of the most awesome views of Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley. That's as far as I've been so far. This could easily be a ½ day if not all day drive. There are several turn-offs and parking areas on the way north. I recommend you take the time to stop on your way north. Using these when going south is way too dangerous between the winding nature of the roads and the absurd speeds many drivers take this road at.This drive is a must if you like mountain driving and mountain scenery. But, as other reviewers have said: Pay attention to your driving and watch your speed! Note that parts of this drive may be closed in winter due to snow and at any time due to fallen rocks.",Robert F B
40,Drive through the San Gabriels ...,"Driving Angeles Crest Hwy. from West to East is a fun ½ - 1 day experience if you want to get outside LA and see some of the backwoods area nearby.

Watch out for falling rocks in the road. Enjoy the scenery! ...",David B L

40,Great views but drive safe,"I took this road expecting it to be a great drivers road, but quickly realized that this is NOT the road for spirited driving. Tujunga canyon is a much better choice for that kind of driving. I say this because the road is completely littered with large rocks that fall down from the hillsides. You will damage your vehicle or cause an accident if you're speeding on this road.Having said that the views are excellent and I definitely recommend it as a scenic route!",RyguyC
40,But please drive carefully!,"I'm up here almost every other weekend to go hiking. It is absolutely stunning, and the gateway to some of the best hiking in Southern California. But it is a windy, mountain road, and there are very few passing lanes. So please! If you want to drive slowly and enjoy the views, pull over at the frequent pullouts, and let those who want to drive faster go by. If you don't, they will be tempted to pass you unsafely on a blind curve. Every weekend there are accidents on this road, mostly motorcycles and people in fast cars using it as a race track. There aren't enough police to enforce the speed limits, so please don't try to do it yourself. If you want to stop and park and hike at all, you will need a Wilderness Permit ($5 day pass at most ranger stations or you can get an annual pass for about $30).",EBrowne
40,"Beautiful, Rugged But Be Sensible","This is a gorgeous way to approach Los Angeles - heaps more scenic than the freeway. We entered at the eastern end and finished up at La Canada.The views are spectacular and completely different from what else I'd seen around Los Angeles. There are a lot of turn outs where you can stop and take photos or a break from driving. The road is very windy and some drop-offs are stomach churning. If you've been researching doing this drive you'll have read about numerous accidents - don't do this is you are a nervous driver or passenger! This is an active drive and best done by experienced, sensible drivers.The road was of very good quality although there were a few rocks scattered here and there. You'd definitely need to be careful of ice in winter as there was still snow in shady places in April.",Louisevr1
50,Awesome fun drive,"It was a beautiful day, the sun beat downI had the radio on, I was drivin'Trees flew by, me and Del were singin' little RunawayI was flyin'This is exactly how I feel when cruisin Angeles Crest. One of my all time favorite roads to drive anywhere.It has Twisties, Vistas, occasionally Snow, hikes, camping, and dare I say it... NATURE! It's crazy. You can experience so much great stuff on this drive regardless of your wanting to be touristy or beaten down the road on a bike or sliding turns like you're a D-1 supastah! This is such a fun road to cruise.Pro Tip: This road goes from Glendale to Wrightwood Hwy 2 to Hwy 138 (lets out at the 15)It helps that there are not a lot of slowpoke looky loos as you can get around them if you are cruizen as its 4 lanes , but it is also a very well kept road that leads to some of the best hikes around. Want to go camping? Well this is a place that has some kewl campgrounds or places to hike and camp overnight not super far off. This could also be a great bicycle ride if you are feeling daring and want to work on your hill climbs.Pro Tip #2: The road is usually closed in the winter as it is not plowed.So essentially this road dances down the mountain range that is on the North Eastern edge of the LA basin and corrals the entire area. On the other side of the range is the desert.If you have never had a chance to drive this road, get off your butt and check it out sometime. It is spectacular and well worth it. IMHO... also there are a couple of kewl little stores and grub spots at either end of the run...",Schel74

We only saw one car going our direction all journey, and less than a dozen passing coming the other way.The views from inspiration point turnout at the top were amazing.I can imagine this is a very different drive in the winter, but in the summer it was a lovely easy scenic drive, and a real highlight of our road trip from Miami to LA.A hidden gem, Recommended",Dave_W806

The lighting is better with the sun at your back The day was perfect for this~ pristine so I could appreciate the vistas. As mountain driving goes this is not difficult. The road is in good shape, the curves easy, and there are guardrails! Turn outs are plentiful for pictures, and there are enough passing lanes till you reach the Mt. Wilson cutoff. No gas stations , there are restrooms and a couple cafe's. Pack a lunch, fill the tank and enjoy the ride!BTW it tops out at about 7,900 ft It'll be cool!",CATTSAR
