50,So customer friendly!,"Our favorite place to see a concert or show. It's so easy to access and to get out without waiting in a long line. We buy a package of tickets and see about 6 shows a year. Acoustics are excellent. We like the balcony seats, but if you sit on the ground floor, sometimes performers, such as Paul Anka, come out into the audience. Many well known artists perform there. Parking is free and you can be on the 91 Freeway in 5 minutes when the show is over. If you have a problem, the box office is easy to work with.",van m
50,Mariachi Christmas,"Wonderful venue and performance! We had never been to this venue, and it's quite impressive for a city property. Very accessible, clear sightlines, comfortable seats. The interior is a cross between American Craftsman and Disneyland's Grand Californian Hotel.The Merry-Achi Christmas show (2019 is it's 22nd consecutive year) is quite an extravaganza. Excellent talent and great fun!",RxFoodie1947
50,A World Class Venue and Performance in a Surprising Place,"Our first (we hope of many) experience attending a performance at the Cerritos Center was exceptional. Frankly, we did not know what to expect, and booked our tickets so close to the date of performance that the seats we preferred were not available. Yet, the manager of the box office, Matthew, assured me he would upgrade if something better became available - and he did! The ushers were friendly and the venue is as impressive as those of much larger urban centers. Bravo.",Greg2G
50,We simply had no idea,"My wife and I went to see Once, The Musical last night. This place is easy to get to from anywhere in LA and OC. PArking was ample nad free. The exterior and interior of the center are both very nice. The set up for last night was a theater in the round, with close up seating. What was most remarkable was the flexibility of this venue to rearrange itself in multiple configurations. During intermission there were multiple concession stands. Facilities were clean and staff were friendly. If the performer is good, I would come back in a heartbeat because I had no idea how much I would enjoy this venue.",FGU

20,Ticket Availability,"On July 8, 2019, I went on the Cerritos Center website and purchased two Johnny Mathis tickets. They were for my soon to be turning 85 year old disabled veteran father and his wife who have been Johnny Mathis fans since the 1950's. Price did not matter, as I wanted the best seats available, closest to the stage, as this could be my father's last time to be able to see Johnny Mathis in person.Today, I went back onto the Cerritos Center site in order to download a copy of the seating chart for my father so he could see where he will be sitting, and on the seating chart, there were now showing box seats on either side of the stage, which were a much better location than the Orchestra seats I purchased back on July 8th.While originally searching the seat chart, it appeared the Orchestra had the best available seats. No box seats to the right and left of the Stage were showing as either available or sold out. At the time, I felt as though I was purchasing the best seats in the house, but unbeknownst to me, there were better seats; it's just that they were not posted.I'm not sure how Cerritos Center posts and sells their seating tickets, but this was certainly a disappointing surprise and it will not happen to me again.",Debi B
50,An evening with Smokey Robinson,"I have always enjoyed events at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. I have been there 3 times, the most recent being on December 29, 2018, to see Smokey Robinson. An incredible show. Although the theater is very large, the seating layout affords good views of the stage and the acoustics and lighting add to the performance. The theater is clean, the seats are comfortable, and the air circulation good. There are quite a few levels depending upon where your seats are located, but both stairs and elevators are accessible. Since the theater is large, it is a good idea to arrive on the early side because of the crowds. The flow of people within the theater is smooth, however, since the theater has been well designed to accommodate a full house. Bathrooms are plentiful to make intermissions less taxing for females. Parking is free, fairly close to the theater, and seems to accommodate all in attendance. The theater is close to freeways and there are a couple of restaurants nearby for dinner or lunch. Dress is everything from casual to more formal for those who look forward to wearing evening clothes. It is a beautiful theater with a variety of events to chose from.",Annie
50,Excellent Venue Great Performances,"We've enjoyed a wide variety of performances, from musical theater to concerts. Always a great experience. I suggest spending a bit more for the 'good' seats.

It was a fun and wonderful way to spend an evening together after a couple of weeks of both of us going and going, often in opposite directions! The songs were fun.

Just the right length.",philfourthirteen

Seating is rather uncomfortable, but not as bad as other places. Sound quality excellent. I would be interested in hearing music (we attended an improve comedy program), but with the large over-hanging balconies, I hesitate to assume that the acoustics would be good.

I think it cost $3. We did it and got a box near the stage at stage level for the wonderful Peter Cetera. All the ushers are dressed as ushers and bring you to your seat. Very well organized.

I was very hesitant thinking the seats would be horrible...but I succumb to my wife and went ahead and purchased tickets. Boy am I glad I did. I really had about the worst tickets at the venue and it was still great. This venue sounds great and the design of the place is more up then away, so the view was still very good.

There really didn't seem to be bad seats anywhere.There were two alcohol bars and 1 cafe that open an hour prior to show time. Plenty of parking and freeway close.,Rubten
40,Up close and Personal,"I have been a few times - saw Leo Kottke there and it was like seeing him in someine's living room (a really big lving room)... I had good seats and was no more than 15 feet away from him. I't's not as fancy as OC's PAC or LA's Music Center, but the intimacy is a good trade off and it's so much easier to get to and there are a couple of good restaurants across the street, including a Macaroni's Grill!!",Lee_A_Designer

50,"great room, friendly staff","we liked it all, comfy seats, not too packed in, roomy stage, nice acoustics, solid sound system and good lighting, easy to get around the pleasant lobby spaces, all seats are a good view (1400-1700 cap), and the only problem for us is the trip across county during rush hour for a mid-week evening show, but it's a really fine venue with helpful and cheerful staff. And parking is free two blocks away, with plenty of restaurants.",drfertig
40,Nice place to watch your favorite tenor,"Just sit back and relax, enjoy the show. It;s a nice location and you don't have to deal with the downtown freeways or traffic for that matter.",LizC2012
50,Good little arts theatre,Great sound. Not huge. Cozy feeling. Seats are straight backed and look uncomfortable but really aren't. Have balcony seats in tiers on the sides,NurseB11

50,Go to this venue!,"We have been to the Cerritos Center many times. It's the most beautiful theatre we have ever been in! The seats are fairly comfortable. My husband is tall, and he fits pretty well. We've seen performances from all sections of the theatrel; there really isn't a bad seat in the house! There is also ample seating for people in wheelchairs/scooters. The sound system is excellent -- and the sound doesn't get so loud that one wished for ear plugs!There are cocktails and other beverages, as well as snacks, available before the show and at intermission. If you wish to have a beverage at intermission, you can order it ahead of time and it will be waiting for you. During intermission, you can sit by the large fireplace indoors, or you can stroll outside and enjoy the fountain and sculpture of musicians.The theatre is largely staffed by very friendly volunteers. Don't hesitate to ask them questions about the lovely theatre, the event, etc.The parking is free. There are numerous restaurants close to the theatre that cater to the theatre crowd.The Cerritos Center offers many programs for children. And many shows throughout the year are definitely children-friendly.We live in Murrieta now, but still buy tickets for 4-6 shows a year. You won't see anything that you won't enjoy. There are many hotels close by, too, if you prefer to make a weekend out of your experience.",Lepha
50,Beautiful venue tucked away in the burbs!,"Love this venue! Not just for the locale, but for the overall ambiance of the theatre. A nice feature is how they can reconfigure seats based on type of performance....whether attending a concert, acrobatic show, play, or solo act, it's all doable. Even without a closeup view from upper tier, you can experience excellent sound quality from any seat. Bonuses~nearby restaurants that cater to theater crowd and close parking with easy access to freeway. Why drive to downtown when you've got the best in town!",Shimadog
