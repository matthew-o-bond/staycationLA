50,A Hidden Treasure Chest of Exploration and Fun,"Took my 8 and 5 year old granddaughters here and they had a ball playing with the hands-on science experiments. Joined the Association so no cost to enter and it‚Äôs really reasonable. My 2 year old grandson enjoyed the younger child section geared to his age with interactive hands-on activities.Call before you go and see if there will be a field trip from a school the day you want to go, or when they are scheduled to be there. Most have to leave in time to get the kids back for dismissal. The center is not that large and if you have 30-40 school aged kids enjoying themselves your little family may not ! If you forget to call - see if there is a school bus or two parked in front and then you‚Äôll know to come back another day or later.Even without kids this place is fascinating as it talks about the locations history as the place where engineers came up with the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs. As a Downey resident I am very proud of this history and the role it played in getting the USA to the moon and more. So happy this site did not become just part of the shopping mall or hospital or sports complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josephlC5624EE
50,GREAT FOR KIDS!,"Took our four year old grandson and he loved this place. Ran everywhere, tried just about everything that he could get his hands on and really enjoyed himself. Had to take him again on his next visit.Hands on for young children and very enjoyable for adults as well.Give it a try!Enjoy your day!RABBIT",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3678JOHN
30,I was Expecting More,I was looking forward to going to see the Space center but was dissapointed. There isn't really much to see for adults ( more for younger kids). I was hoping for more artifacts and actual space items. We were in and out in 15 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/392philliph
50,History of Downey Contributions to the US Space Program,It was a wonderful experience to recall the success of the US Space Program and the history of Downey Contributions to the US Space Program. It was great to see the enthusiasm of the young people visiting the space center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z110TXjohns
40,"Pretty good, but small space exhibits","This is a pretty small science center designed mainly for kids. Even so, there are some interesting displays that have a lot of interesting details about the technical aspects of the Apollo program.The center is on the former site of Rockwell International (formerly North American Aviation), which designed and built much of the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, so there is a lot of history here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phvi2617
50,Great small space center,"Hands on aerospace experiments, interesting exhibit and movie about Apollo 11, nice robotics lab.For families and other young souls. We spent there about 2 hours.Only disappoint was that there wasn't much material about the Colombia space shuttle, which was our basic reason to arrive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DalitC
40,Best for special events,"Went to the Space Center for the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 11 Lunar landing.Arrived around 11am. The place was already full of people.Lots of booths outside for the kids, like building a rocket that can fly from an air pump.Inside, we got to see a robotics exhibit and a mock up of a mission control and interior of a space lab. Lots of hands on activities. There was also a special documentary of the Apollo 11 launch on the big TV screen.Best of all, the event and admission was free. I'm not sure I would pay admission on a non-special event day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Fun but annoying,"Hello everyone I have recently remembered that I have visited the Columbia memorial space center we had a person named mike he was pretty nice but he had so many rules we couldn‚Äôt let our kids touch anything thing there unless he was there I mean we‚Äôre parents we can watch our children just fine I believe that he was new but it is very educational for your young children at young ages I recommend this for all the parents if you would like your kids to educate and have fun.Thank you for listening,BYE ‚ò∫Ô∏è",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Llmolk
40,An almost hidden gem,"Tucked away behind a shopping center, this little center was a real treat. Space games to entertain younger children within view of the video and other visual exhibits of more interest to adults. I had read a biography of a woman who had worked on rocket fuel at the installation that preceded this center, so was interested in visiting the site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531paulinek
50,Launch Your Imagination,"Got to spend a great couple of hours with the grandkids yesterday at the Columbia Memorial Science Center in Downey. It's on the site of the old North American/Autonetics/Rockwell factory where the Apollo capsules and Space Shuttle were designed and built. The center has walls full of pictures about space travel, especially about Downey's aerospace history, and lots of hands-on science stuff for kids, themed around flight and space science. The kids had fun landing a shuttle, making and launching paper airplanes, and trying their skills at robotics. Admission is modest (3 bucks for a kid, same for seniors); lots of learning and fun for a few bucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnMacMurray
30,"Small, but nice","We enjoyed the Space Center. Doesn't take long to visit, so nice to add into a day of other adventures or if you only have an hour or so. Geared towards young kiddos, not teens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlainag2018
40,Small science center,"There are a few free parking spaces along the street and a mall across the street, so parking should not be a problem. The center itself is 2-stories, but rather small for a science center. Typically, it is youth oriented with many hands-on activities for children (and young at heart, I guess). The admission fee is minimal which compensates for the small scale of the activities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
50,Fun place for all ages,Fun place for all ages. It‚Äôs a celebration of Downey‚Äôs role in the the space program. Smallish museum but still fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Great for kids and saving money,"Inexpensive museum for kids to play lots of activities. They have a cool robotics lab that was fun for parents and our 4 year old. They have legos, kids puzzles, robotic arms to grab things with, a paper plane launcher, a parachute drop for little toy men. I've been there twice now. They also have a veterans and senior discount on an already cheap price. The shuttle simulators are difficult for kids but I found it to be a fun challenge for adults. We probably spend a couple hours at most as the place isn't that large.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc3249
40,Excellent Learning Opportunity on Space Travel,"Our medical facility is close by, therefore, we rent out the Colombia Space Center for our offsite meetings and annual service award event. It is not huge but spacious enough for us to fit tables and accommodate 60 -70 people. Without tables, up to a little over 100.The various interactive exhibits are great! Space Rockets, marbles to test the velocity of travel, a space suit, etc. They bring out the kid in me, not really hard to doüòä. They also have a science program for children on the weekend that requires enrollment for a nominal fee. A great opportunity for young and old to learn about the space industry as well as purchase memorabilia.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joyce109
40,Good for all ages,"Smallish museum, but with enough exhibits and interactive items for all ages. Admittedly in a small building, the museum has items clearly geared for younger participants. However, there was sufficient material for older visitors, and the exhibits showed how influential the development of space travel was to the community. In fact, many of the vital components critical for safe space travel were made in Downey. Expect to spend no more than 2 hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cutr2000
50,awesome place o visit,The set-up is amazing..Downey is very proud of this tribute to the space industry...A must-see place for all,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordand6
50,Really nice memorial and museum,A really nice memorial and education center for the space shuttle Columbia. And the people that lost their lives. It's not huge but it is a decent size. And it is good for adults and younger people too,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/811bernardf
10,Boring,"I live in downey and this place, you always see empty lot cause, no one really goes in here. The place is small does not have many options to look at. I brought my kids here and even my kids say that is boring. The activities that you do here are boring . Nothing special i wonder how this place stays open. Cause of low attending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zate22
40,Interaction keeps kids busy,Great place to learn the history of the space age and Downey. Too many people are unaware of Downey's connection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/omagin
50,Lovely place to visit,The Memorial Space Center is a very interesting and poignant memorial. It is really well laid out and for kids of all ages (including adults) there are many activities to keep all entertained for a few hours. The staff are really polite and helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulMD12
50,It was fun...,I have a 4 an 8 and a 10 yr old and they all had fun it is little and puzzles were not complete (my 4yr old loves puzzles) but we had a fun couple of hrs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
50,What A Surprise!,"We had some time to kill before an evening event. One of the nearby options that a Trip Advisor attractions search produced was this one. What a surprise!! This little space museum has very creative hands-on displays that are interesting for adults and children. Examples include space shuttle landing simulator, robotics programming, airplane flight simulator, and several more. There are also several interesting videos available. For anyone interested in the space program (or anyone trying to get a child interested in space or the sciences), this museum is a a MUST!.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stein525
20,Disappointed,This place is in my neighborhood and every time in the last 2 years I've taken my grandchildren the exhibits have be down... It's very small and they charge $5.00 per person including adults. I spent $20.00 and was there only 5 minutes due to all the exhibits being down. Sorry Columbia but you need to step up your game....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abakerPS
50,Fun museum!,"A rather small venue, but what it lacks in size it has in space shuttle knowledge. The location has lots of history with the shuttle program and you will enjoy all that has come to the city of Downey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamezn2014
50,podcast,"(94) http://www.blogtalkradio.com/s3production/2014/03/27/columbia-memorial-space-centerColumbia Memorial Space CenterI want to Thank Rick O‚ÄôConner and Jose Carrillo for having me and sharing their storiesAlso I want to thanks to Sarah Medina who made this all possibleThe Columbia Memorial Space Center is a hands-on learning center that is dedicated to bringing the wonder and excitement of space science to children of all ages. We also serve as the national memorial for the Space Shuttle Columbia‚Äôs seven crew members, lost in 2003. Located in Downey, California, we strive to be the most accessible space science center in the Los Angeles area.I worked at Rockwell International in my past life and spent about 3 years in Downey so revisiting the Museum brings back many memories. I was working for Rockwell the day Space Shuttle Challenger disaster occurred on January 28, 1986, when Space Shuttle Challenger (mission STS-51-L) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members.We have 2 very knowledgeable Activity Specialist who will be your interviewees, Richard 'Rick' O'Connor and Jose Carrillo. Both are veteran staff with us at the Columbia Memorial Space Center and are very knowledgeable of all our exhibits and programs that we offer. They are often leads in creating new programs and assist with the coordination of our special events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/s3production
50,HOME TOWN FUN,"Even the Columbia Memorial Space Center is very close to us we had neglected to visit it. Always meant to, but just kept putting it off. Our Bad! Should have gone sooner. Great place, especially if you have kids. Kids and adults can both touch and play with some of the exhibits. Not a very large location, but if you take your time you can easily spend a few fun and educational hours there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3678JOHN
50,Best five dollars I've spent in a while,"So I was dropping off my wife for work at the hospital where she works and in the parking lot where I drop her off there was a Lunar Space Module. Wait What?!Yup , there was a real lunar module there. Right outside the hospital. I've spent some time in Downey and you can see some hints of what was here before. There is a small icon or thumbnail of a space shuttle on ""challenger way"" or the plaques of space mile stones located in the shopping center nearby.Did anyone else know that this place is the best $5 you can spend in this town? (other than inside a Portos?)I spent THREE hours here. Its a full learning/science center. They have an orbital simulator, Simulations, Landing simulator (pitch only though), plenty of rockets to shoot around and lectures all abound.I sat in on a greatlecture of the history of NASA and what they are doing and couldn't believe the amount of first hand information I was getting for $5.00 entry fee.And I haven't even told you the best part. There is a full size mock up of the shuttle, right here! Incredible. Five full stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SonicSpringBok
