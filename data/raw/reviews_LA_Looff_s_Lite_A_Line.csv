50,A quirky SoCal classic...,"A living relic of days past, Loof's Lite-a-Line is a strange gem of an attraction, utterly unique and unique to Southern California. The centerpiece is the game itself...a surprisingly addicting (and fun) hybrid of bingo, pinball, and pachinko, which has players launching a metal ball into board populated by bumpers and a series of holes that correspond to an individualized, automated bingo card. Roll the balls into the holes that ""lite a line,"" and you win $15 for your $1.25 investment. The game is fast and fun, the vibe is low-key, the staff extraordinarily friendly and helpful. But the charm of Loof's goes deeper. Once upon a time, there was an Edwardian pleasure pier stretching out into the Pacific in Long Beach. It was called The Pike, and it's long-gone now, although the entertainment district at the end of Pine that was built over its remains uses the name. Loof's is the last survivor, and was forced to move years ago to its current location. The place is stuffed with remnants of the Pike, and those lucky enough to have visited it while it stood, will get a real kick out of looking at the display cases. A car from the old coaster is there, along with carved carousel horses, signs, and other items rescued from oblivion. So, you can do a bit of odd and delightful minor gambling, and take in real Southern California history while you're at it. What's not to love?",venckman2017
