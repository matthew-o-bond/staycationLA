40,Finally went!,Always wanted to go since I spent some time in a related industry(electronic printing. Focus was on traditional printing. Souvenirs (that we made) were great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmarinello
50,Preserving History,"Have you ever sat before your word processor and wondered why you call capitol letters upper case and small letters lower case? Come to the International Printing Museum and learn the answer. This building is filled with printers going back almost to Gutenberg. The tour demonstrated how an early printer worked, about a dozen steps, about a minute a page. We saw a demonstration of making movable type using a mold and watched as a letter was cast using a hot mix of lead, tin, and antimony. There are several large linotype type setters which cast a full line of type which is melted down and reused after printing. There are small printers once used for hand bills and business cards. Besides printers, there are cases of type and other items necessary to print. Before the day of the desk top computer and ink jet printer, these mechanical wonders brought information to the world and it is good that a place exists to preserve, demonstrate, and display them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,A museum that shouldn't be missed...,"We attended the Dickens Holiday Show last year based upon the recommendation of friends....our kids loved it, and so did we. Who would have ever thought that a place so rich in history could be ""hidden"" in Carson California!They now have on display the oldest Heidelberg Press in all of North America, circa 1905, I was told that the only older one is actually in Germany at the factory. This year we are planning on attending the Printers Fair. Our friends told us that all types of hand made cards, papers, etc. are on display and for sale, and that you can actually print posters yourself.If you love history, antiques or anything of the sort you should definitely make it a point to spend a day at the museum, or if you have a chance try to see one of their shows. You won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberto3250
50,Great history!,"My husband and I came here with a Groupon deal. Totally worth it, even if we had paid full price. There were plenty of people working that we got our own private tour with George who was so knowledgeable and very friendly! We learned so much about the different printing machines used throughout history and all of them were still in working order! Plan ahead (unlike we did) and bring several $1 dollar bills. They will make “slugs” of whatever you’d like to take home and other cool prints too! We had a great time here and will definitely be going back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stacy_anders
50,Fantastic place and so close,"Came here for a tour with our GS troop. Didn't sound that interesting but wow! Our tour guide Sara was so knowledgeable and made it fun and educational for the girls. They had a short interactive lecture with her and then she took us around and showed us all the printing presses thru the years with a short demonstration on each. Even I learned a lot about the history and how books were made. They are located in Carson just off the Harbor Freeway and so close to us. I would highly recommend everyone to visit, especially kids who loves books.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twinmom8
40,Unique,...went there for a show a few years ago -- show was great and the museum was there to tour but had few docents at the time...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougdowds
50,"Unbelievably worthwhile, a Hidden Gem indeed!","You're thinking, ""a museum about printing?"" Go ahead and scoff - but visit. You start out mildly interested in the printing presses on display. Then they demonstrate them. You have to admit they're kinda cool. The guys who run this place are so dedicated to the history of the printing presses and America that you can't help but enjoy every minute. One tip: you HAVE to make your first visit on a day when they're putting on a play, a show, a skit, a recreational conversation. Ben Franklin is so real and so funny you will forget you are being educated! And the kids will love it as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATXWASteveG
50,Granddaughters scavenger hunt.,We were aiding our granddaughter with her list of places on a project for her school. The printing museum was on that list. It was an interesting place to visit. The floor space was covered with different types and models of printing presses. You have to visit to appreciate it. Nice tour for children and young adults.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stancarr
40,Great Field Trip!,"I went with middle school students from Summer School. I was so surprised that this place exist. It was a small place with tons of printing press machines inside. We stayed from 10am to 2pm. Students got to experience how to make paper and print using a replica of Gutenberg's printing press and ink rollers. They also learned how to bind a mini booklet and learn about Ben Franklin's inventions. They only have the front of the Museum (facing the busy street) for their lunch area. The kids just stayed on the grassy side which was 3 feet from the busy street. Overall,the students enjoyed their experience.They also have a newsletter that list activities available during the month. Parents of toddlers might have to carry them so they can see the top of the printing press or the machines. There is a very small gift shop, one restroom, and no cafeteria.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magviajemas
50,Great way to spend the afternoon!,"They have the third oldest printing press in the U.S. (1806). The two oldest are in the Smithsonian. There is also a replica of Ben Franklin's print shop, working Linotype machines and they do demonstrations if you take the tour. Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damiensomerset
50,Enchanting,"We want to go back to see the Ben Franklin show. It is a lively historical experience.If you do not know the significance of the Guttenberg Bible or the most complicated machine ever invented which made the newspaper possible, then go here.It is completely invisible, found by address only. So hook up the Navigator & go.I would call first to see about a tour as it is a private collection run by volunteers.The closest thing to those historical printers would be the time machines in a few movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
50,Best Boy Scout MB!,"The museum was awesome. The BSA Graphic Arts & Pulp & Paper MB were awesome. We came up from San Diego, we met people from San Francisco Area and there were people from Virginia. The entire day was well planned, hands on and lots of fun! This was one of the best MB days we have ever been too. The staff and volunteers were wonderful. Their passion showed and made the experience that much better. Highly recommend this event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HarobedE
50,Terrific little museum with lots of working printing machines,"I took my kids, 10 and 6, to the International Printing Museum on 10/24/09. Our guide, Gary, took us through the history of printing, from the Chinese to Gutenberg to the LinoType. We all found it fascinating. He showed us how the machines worked, and printed out some samples.It's not cheap at $8 per adult and $7 for students, but for that price, you get a quirky, knowledgeable guide who actually works the machines and explains why they were invented. For anyone interested in machinery or history, it is absolutely fascinating. Our tour lasted over an hour and a half, and probably could have gone on longer if we hadn't had to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jcstorr
