40,Hidden gem,My friend invited me to come see a live band play at the backstage. Will Ryan and the Cactus County Cowboys were performing on Sunday night. I ordered a small coffee and a slice of apple pie which turned out to be really good and not over sweetened. The band was great and the country music was perfectly performed by the eclectic group. I look forward to seeing future venues at this local gem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
50,great music venue,Amazing local place to enjoy all types of music from talented musicians. Always a wonderful show. All seats are good. Price point very reasonable,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotta123
50,Our very favorite!,"I have been to The Coffee Gallery Backstage more times than I can count, and have had a wonderful time every single time. For an intimate concert experience at a ridiculously low price, you just cannot beat this venue. Bob Stane is in a class by himself. This place won’t be here forever, you’ll be sorry if you don’t take advantage of it soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaga0072018
50,Best kept secret for musical evenings on a budget i Altadena,"Bob Stane, he of the ""Fork in the road"" in Pasadena and a former owner of the ""Ice House"", gifted Altadena with this 49 seat venue featuring local and national talent including the likes of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Steve Martin, Sligo Rags, Blue Grass, Doo Wop and others.Good times are promised on most nights (Tuesday - Sundays) at $15 - 20 per. An alcohol free evening with coffee and goodies from the café. We have been going for 15 years and never had a bad evening. Call for reservations (recommended depending on who is playing) after visiting his website, something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
40,Great Music for Little Dough,"The Coffee Gallery Backstage is as quirky as its ringmaster, Bob Stane, who co-founded the Ice House in Pasadena. Bob uses the connections he has built over his long career to bring in world class musicians for an evening of great performances. We recently saw the Jangle Bros. John York (a former Byrd member) and his friends played for two hours! It was a lot of fun. If you would like to introduce your 14-year-old to the music of your life, you can do that here. No alcohol is served. But they do have coffee and real milkshakes. The audience is capped at about 45 people, so it's important to go early to get a good seat. And, it can get warm in the Backstage, so I take a fan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matthewlP6234XZ
50,Wow,"I've been attending shows here for two decades. Yes most of the folks in the room are old, but they are seeing the best Celtic, Rock, Blues, Folk and Jazz you can see in LA and at a REALLY REASONABLE price. Its kind of confusing you have to go through the Coffee Gallery Coffee Place to get there. The coffee place used to be a wonderful living room of coffee comfort food. its trying to gentrify the space and menu unsuccessfully. That enterprise has nothing to do with the Coffee Gallery Backstage. Enjoy the backstage, use the front as a hallway, and you'll have a great night. Amy's Patio Café up the street is a good place to eat",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottL782
50,Nights to remember,"Backstage is the best kept secret in town. Where else can you enjoy ""live music"" in a non-alcoholic 49 seat venue? Week after week Bob Stane brings us live acts from the 60s to the present. Backstage is a not to be missed venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8

50,Intimate venue for serious folk music listeners,"Heard The Salty Suites and Trio Dinicu perform. Fantastic performances with small, respectful audience and cozy setting. Great sound. Bob Stane features the best in folk, bluegrass, gypsy jazz, international, barbershop quartet, ukelele, swing and beyond!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaturalistJoel
30,Cozy atmosphere; Bohemian feel :-),"This place reminds me of my time in Edinburgh, Scotland. I like it that it is a small and independent business. The attraction is how it pulls local people together in a small and cozy environment. Mismatched cups, lounging sofas and books abound makes it feel like home. It's also a venue for local performance artists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari07
40,Read the Tip Jar,"I am a fan of this place. It has a nice vibe and plenty of regulars and when a stranger walks in, she does not feel strange. I cannot say how often I have been able to have an enjoyable conversation with someone at the Coffee Gallery. Fly, one of the Baristas, also is an amazing chef, who is experimenting with gluten-free options. He really does some amazing baking. This is a wonderful place to enjoy local flavor and local art. Stop by. And leave a tip in the tip jar. Because every time you do, Chuck Norris does a roundhouse kick to Justin Bieber (read the tip jar).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizaTip
