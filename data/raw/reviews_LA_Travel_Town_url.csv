50,Free,"Lovely place! Lots of trains to see and things to explore. The entry is free and it’s a very interesting and visual place for children. My son enjoyed exploring the trains, you can go on board and look around. There is a gift shop and a small stall which sells fruit. Lovely place! Great collection of trains!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sharonwa
50,All on board !!!,"Fantastic place to go. Having heard for first time in a Columbo’ s episode, this a place that surely you would enjoy, above all if you are a train fanatic. It is free of charge and plenty space to park. Totally would recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
40,Choo Choo Village,"The ancient trains, locomotives, maintenance, and tours added together to make this an interesting site to visit. Not far from Griffith Observatory, it has some of every kind of passenger car including ones for the wealthy that travelled luxuriously back then. I liked it that people were on hand to explain the history of certain areas. The ancient locomotives brought back a few childhood memories. You also don't want to miss the many displays inside the buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
40,Enjoyable,"We spent about an hour here. Great that entrance was free, but the miniature train ride wasn't (and for 4 tickets it's quite expensive compared to other rides of a similar nature). Lots of old trains but a number of them could really do with some work as they are starting to rust and decay. Pity you can't actually go on board any of them.If you love trains, then certainly visit, but otherwise there isn't really much to do here. There is a small inside area for the kids to play with Thomas type trains and a picnic area out back...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
50,A Lot to See,"We had visited a few months earlier, but my wife was tired then and we didn’t see it all, so we came back to see the rest. My wife hung out in the large building that shelters some of the rail equipment, a circus wagon, and a model railroad while I explored the two corners I missed last time. I’m not sure why, but I find the narrow gauge cars from Hawaii interesting and you need to stand next to a two story tall steam locomotive to understand these iron horses. There were several birthday parties going on which might interest your child. Just as I started to retrieve my wife I stepped into a small building about the center of the museum that I had thought were offices or restrooms, maybe a former gift shop, but is actually a very nice exhibit on the Harvey House chain. From the days when railroads opened the west until air travel took over, the Harvey House chain worked with the railroads to provide quick reliable meals and accommodations to passengers. They were usually in or near the station and the Harvey Girls could feed a train full of passengers during a refueling stop. The Harvey Girls did as much to open the west as the track layers. There were serving plates, costumes, menus, and other Harvey House memorabilia. I’m glad I looked in the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,Fun,"This is a fun place to explore for little kids, especially if they like trains. Grown ups can enjoy this too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,Pretty good free museum but needs some TLC.,"For a free museum that's mostly outdoors it's pretty cool but it needs some maintenance. There's a beautiful old cable car that's not only falling apart, but the signs for it are mostly gone, for instance along with other exhibits that are sadly decaying. It desperately needs restoration and to be taken indoors.It's not a hot day activity either. Even the one building is a bit too warm. I know they can't put an AC in there as it's a big barn like building with two huge doors that stay open, but they could put some large fans up on the ceiling to stir the air a bit because even with the doors open it's a touch stuffy.Still it's worth going at least once to say you've been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697jamir
30,"Free attraction, worth a quick visit.","We were looking for something quick to do on our last day in LA, on the way to the airport. Since this was free, it fit the bill.This train yard has quite a few old trains, both engines and cars. You can't walk in any of them which was disappointing. Also, there are no signs or information on the trains to help identify them. The website did help with that, however. We spent maybe an hour at the site, which included the 15min mini-train ride around the perimeter of the park.If you're looking for a whole experience and to walk in / out of trains - this is not the place for you. Considering it was free, however, it' s worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keltik01

40,"Great, free place to spend a few hours with little kids","Travel Town is a super (and free!) attraction for train enthusiasts, both young and old. It is a compact attraction with room for kids to explore. We visited on a Sunday morning and it was not crowded and there was plenty of parking, too. The kids loved exploring the various trains including many of the hands-on attractions.We also enjoyed a train ride around the park, which came with a reasonable cost. There is a picnic area that has some vending machines. There is a cute museum shop that sells train-themed items, at prices comparable to similar retail outlets.Overall, a great place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelskt
40,Great with kids,"This is a very manageable museum with old locomotives and various types of cars, as well as some older vehicles used to transport milk and fuel. A miniature train ride around the facilities is particularly fun for children.I visited with my 2+ year old granddaughter and she enjoyed the unusual cars, the large locomotives, and specifically the miniature train ride. There is a train-oriented gift shop on the premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscogX7190AH
50,Nice little museum.,"Fun afternoon trip with some interesting locomotives. Has a Fred Harvey display, a nice surprise, a unique treat. Not real big but worth the stop.

Although the rest of Los Angeles is a mecca for the criminals & the homeless, TravelTown retains its unique character and charm as one one America's few places to actually climb into a real locomotive.

40,Mostly Travel by Train,"I've visited many times, but it had been a while. My wife went with me reluctantly and then I had to drag her out of the building with the several model railroads. When I was younger, most of the equipment was outside, but now several cars (in bad condition) are in the same building as the model railroads and many pieces of equipment are now under an open side, roof covered shed. The entrance had also been moved, now off to the west end. There are still trail rides in a train maybe 1/6 scale. There are still more pieces of equipment outside, maybe they can build a second shed.It is mostly railroad. When I was younger, there were two or three airplanes, but I didn't see them. There is a circus wagon, but I didn't see the fire engines I remember from the past.There is a new large gift shop. We noticed two or three birthday parties. Parking and admission is free with a small cost for the train rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,smaller place than I expected but my kid did enjoy it,"we went there in August 2018, it was boiling hot and there weren't many trees around, however my kid loved the trains there. you dont need to buy tickets to visit .(But we paid $40 for uber to get there and same for return, it's ok to visit there if you are close, for me $80 for uber to go there (for a small place) is a bit too much",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cpos0000
40,Fantastic free to enter collection of locomotives,"Parking is free and it’s free to enter. There is a cafe and shop (shame they don’t have a guide book or list of rolling stock) and in addition to the many steam locomotives they have trolleys, diesel and electric locos. It wonderful though just to wander round and see all the exhibits. My only issue was the lack of information boards that could provide history of each item present. There was a miniature train running round the site at regular intervals. A great free attraction though to stop and wander around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/149stuartc
50,Great place for kids,"This is one of the few free venues that the kids will really enjoy. Actually, I took my disabled husband there who uses a walker. The distances were really too great for him to do much and it was really too hot to urge him to go far. Unfortunately the walk from the entrance to the covered train area is quite far. But for kids, it is a treat, with an inexpensive train ride also. And there is grass for a roll down the hill!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IleeneB

My 3 year old liked it, but it wasn't much to see.Overall, I was not impressed at all. I went to a very similar place in Missouri that had awesome trains that were restored and in great condition.

50,Inexpensive afternoon,Perfect outing for a toddler who loves trains. We did the ride and then walked around looking at all of the trains. I wish we could have gone down the street to see the steamer trains but that we were told was only open on the weekends.This was cheaper than the zoo and we didn’t feel bad when we had to leave after an hour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/funnybunny921
50,Want to climb inside some old trains?,We spent a fun morning with the grandkids checking out trains. My grandson loves trains so Travel Town was a great stop for us. We wandered through train cars and the kids played engineer pretending to run a train engine. There were kids of all ages checking out all the train engines and cars on display. A great little train takes people on a trip around the edges of Travel Town. Travel Town was no charge and the train ride was $2.75 a person. Great way to spend a few hours and not spend a lot of money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharonpM4278PC
50,A must for ANY train enthusiast!,"This place brings back so many fond memories as a kid, for sure it turned me into a train and transportation enthusiast. My parents brought me here as kid, even thought it has changed over the years, its still the same. Back in the day you could climb on all of the locomotives, but now it's a definite no-no. Great place for littlie ones and the entire family. No cost to enter and the small train that goes around travel town has only a small fee. The park even offer party rentals on the train with in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esethebomb

40,Train Enthusiasts Elderly Uncles' Visit,"What to do with my 80 and 90 year old ""train loving"" uncles visiting from out of town? The answer was to visit Travel Town and Live Steamers. From Thousand Oaks on a Saturday morning, the drive was an easy 30 minutes down the 101 freeway. We found plenty of parking and walking was short and easy. Access is free but the park makes their money by charging to host kid's birthday parties and other events so be prepared to share the space with lots of families. There are few employees on the property and tours are mostly self-guided. My suggestions on how to improve the experience would be to enhance the self tours with more informative and amusing signs, snack shop and more volunteer docents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianad762
50,Loved it!,"We visited Travel Town in the afternoon (we'd spent the morning and lunch at the LA Zoo just down the road) with our 2 young kids (age 6 and 3) as part of our week-long spring break vacation in the LA area. We thoroughly enjoyed this free zoo! I think we stayed a couple of hours. We enjoyed the train ride around the perimeter of the park. There were train cars and engines we could climb in and others just to view from the ground. This was an easy in and out, 2-3 hour activity that we enjoyed almost as much as our kids. Highly recommend for younger kids and families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGreenGoWhite1

30,Train lovers - quick stop,"We've been to many transportation museums and were disappointed that this one is limited. Several pieces of old rolling stock, but sitting out in the weather and many need some TLC. This is a city park and appears they don't have a host of volunteers helping keep things looking good. We were there on a Thursday afternoon - only a handful of people here. Small train ride for kids was not running. It's free. Good stop for an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/988chuckb

40,Railroad Enthusiast's Nirvana,"If you like railroads you'll love this place! Has multiple engines, rolling stock, and other railroad pieces on display, in addition to some classic automobiles. Some of which is fully accessible, some on display, and some being refurbished. One engine pre-dates the Civil War as did some rolling stock, with others scattered from afterwards through the 1940s. Best of all - it's free (though you can make a donation). Has a snack shop on site but don't go hungry. For kids there is a miniature railroad that encircles the property. Free parking too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealDoubleM
40,Family-Friendly Activity That Doesn't Take a Lot of Time or Money,"This is a great free attraction in Griffith Park that will appeal to both children and adults who are interested in trains. Numerous locomotives and train cars that have been donated to the city are displayed in a park-like setting. There is a small museum with additional displays of vintage vehicles and a scale-model railroad under construction. We visited because my husband used to go there as a child and it was fun to take a photo of him by the same locomotive that he was photographed on at age 3. There are restrooms, a picnic area, and a small gift shop. When we visited in May 2017, a concession stand was under construction. They offer short rides on a miniature train for a small fee. If you visit on the 3rd Saturday of the month, you can also visit ""Walt's Garage"" next door where there are more miniature trains. It's wonderful that they are preserving all these historic vehicles so that children can learn about them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
30,Good for a picnic with the whole family including your dog 👪🐶,"We went on Monday during the Memorial Day long weekend. There were a number of other families with young ones relaxing under shaded trees and in the picnic area. Most of the trains during our visit were closed off so we were only able to go inside 1 which was a bit disappointing since I was kinda expecting the inside to be furnished with actual chairs and tables. They also had this small locomotive (that goes around the whole travel town 2x) where you and your kids can ride for about $3 each for ages 3 and above (I read before hand that small well behaved dogs could ride the train as well however upon asking about it they said our dog wasn't allowed to ride), which was not bad considering entrance for the park itself was for free.I think it'll be an awesome place as well to have a ""Thomas the train"" inspired birthday party as well as they have certain reserved tables and grills in front of actual trains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casmansilla

30,Good For Short Visit,"Went on a Sunday afternoon at around 3pm. Met some friends for the train ride, which goes twice around the park. This was the highlight for my five year old son. There is a small indoor area with model trains, but they were closing the viewing area around 4pm.Most of the rest of park consisted of old trains, wagons, and cars. We could only view the interior of one train car and climb into one engine. Plenty of space for picnics, and there are train cars for rent for parties. Looks like they are going to open a larger gift shop, which will appeal to train enthusiasts.It's a nice side trip, if you're planning to spend a day at Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Fantastic and free,"We went after hiking and we're pleasantly surprised at the number of trains and the fact that you could climb up inside of some of the old engines and explore the cars. There is an inside museum with a few preserved boxcars, buggies and autos. Interesting. The history of the Fred Harvey restaurants was interesting also. A family was hosting a birthday party in 2 of the antique cars and were having a blast. It is too bad these engines are rusting away. There is a train ride around the little park for $2.75. Free parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRMyers

50,Excellent Fun Time For Kids,Been coming here for almost 50 years. It is such a great place for kids and grownups. Ride the 1/4 scale train (inexpensive) and planning in advance you can have birthday parties on the old time (non-moving) trains. It's a magical place for the young. Free parking too- unheard of in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasEyedoc2020
50,Train fanatics will love it,"Warning: may cause explosive tears from your 5 year old when leaving after 2 hours, when he realises he may never return. It's just that good. About 15 locomotives and carriages, 2 big beautiful sheds, a full miniature ride-on train line, casual food, gift shop, heaps of picnic tables, and you can even go into the cab and carriage of one of the trains. It blew my son's mind. I think his fellow fanatics will love it too. No entrance cost, and only $2.75 per miniature train ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naomie898
40,Great for kids and the young at heart.,"I lived in L.A. eight years, passing this place often, thinking ""I should go there,"" but never went. This time I was in town for a trip and decided to finally hit it. I was not disappointed... much. Free admission rocked, park setting was beautiful, impressive collection of locomotives and rolling stock, housed beneath a railroad canopy... small museum barn for rare and special parts of the collection, a food kiosk, and a gift shop... everything you could want. Except ALL ACCESS!!!Yes, a couple of the locomotives were available for kids to climb up into and play engineer, but the passenger cars were closed. And it was clear that the place lacks the funding to maintain them at their best (peeling paint in places, cracking rubber joints, rust, unvarnished wood... oh, you can see money being spent to maintain things, the majority of the park is in sterling condition, but there just doesn't seem to be enough of it for *everything* there) AND, I had to leave before I could ride the mini train that circles the park. Argh! That being said, the park is convenient to the 134 freeway, has an impressive (high maintenance) collection, and seems like a pretty cool place to spend a few hours, especially if you have kids.(P.S. The gift shop had some pretty cool items. I ended up getting more than I'd planned to... my brother's a rail enthusiast)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HughMcAloon
50,Excellent Budget-friendly Fun!,"My kids loved this train park. There were lots of trains to look at and the place was very beautiful. I just wish there were more trains to play on—most were display trains only. There was also a lot of walking at this park. It was wheelchair accessible for the most part, except on the train. The crowd was not bad for a Saturday. We didn't have to wait long to ride the train. The train was very well priced and there was no admission to the facility. There was a snack bar there too, but we didn't eat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW-Surprise

40,Lovely little place for train enthusiasts of all ages,"We visited here on a Sunday and accompanied it with the nearby LA Live steamers. It's basically lots of old engines and carriages for you to look at, it's free except for the little train ride which was $2.75 each I believe it was, for that you get two circuits of the track. Great for kids of all ages. My only disappointment was on the day we visited there were lots of areas reserved for children's parties in fact every picnic area and several carriages had reserved signs and parties being set up by parents. We was there at opening time so the guests hadn't arrived...I was glad as I could just imagine it with all the children there.It was a lovely little place to spend an hour or two especially being from the uk, it gave us a good insight into trains different from what we usually see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbug_family39

It's a popular destination for locals and visitors but it's a large enough space that it doesn't feel too crowded.The only time you'll notice a crowd is when it's time to line up for the train ride. The mini-train ride does have a cost, but it's minimal.There are areas to picnic and a small gift shop and snack bar but you'd be better off packing a lunch.Nearby is a playground (Shane's inspiration) and the LA Zoo and the Autry museum.Would we go again?

40,Great place to spend the afternoon!,"I brought my 2 year old daughter here in the hopes that it would help me find a way to keep her entertained for the afternoon. It's free admission, other than if you want to take the train ride (which is $2.75 for everyone, except babies under 18 months old who ride free). They have a bunch of old trains outside that you can take a look at (and some that you can go inside of), and then also an indoor exhibit hall with some more train components and old school cars.In the exhibit hall, they also have a small children's area with a wooden toy train track set up. If you bring your own trains, your child can play with it to their heart's content. Make sure to bring your own since they don't provide any toys unless you go buy some in the gift shop. I'm talking about the Thomas type trains, nothing fancy.It was pretty quiet on a Tuesday afternoon, though I anticipate it gets much busier on weekends. Lots of outdoor room for kids to run around, and very easy on-site parking. Definitely a good way to spend an afternoon with kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferD637
40,Fun For The Grandchild,"Took my granddaughter today being that we were in the area. She is 2 1/2. Free parking. Free entry. Free to walk around the museum and to see all the trains they have. It cost us $5.00 for the both of us to take the train ride. The engineer was a very nice guy. We sat in the very back and my little one enjoyed herself a great deal. The ride went around the loop twice giving you plenty of time to take pictures of the trains. Once the ride was over, we went into the gift shop. Very expensive prices in the gift shop. We bought a bag of chips and bottle of water from a cart vendor there. $1.75 was a fair total. Overall, we had a great time. Do we recommend it? Oh yes we sure do. Great way to spend some time with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninee

40,No Crowds,Travel Town has old trains and engines and a small museum. Far less crowds than main area of Griffith Park . They don't have the ponies nor the larger selection of food but the same train rides for the kiddies without the crowds and long lines. Nice way to spend for short visit. Close to other attractions in and around the Park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joee496
50,You Have To Come And See These Trains! And More!,"GREAT old trains to see here! Most of these old beauties are gone-but the ones here that have been saved are wonderful to see! There is a small park train to ride around on with or without the kids. A great little museum with old fire engines, cars, wagons and more...including guys working on a little/big train set up behind a big window that is redone every few years-it is great too though!

True kids can even ride a miniature train while visiting. There is also a neat museum to visit. Plan for a picnic and make it a really memorable day! Enjoy. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Thomas the Train Lives!,"If you are looking for a great family day this is a nice place to start. Who doesn't love trains. Here you can climb on them, and even ride on one. If you have never been it's a great way to enjoy them. Our Niece reserved an area for a birthday party and they set up a train for the kids to play with. And outside of a small price for the train ride, the rest is free. Go on, have some fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoHoMike
40,Travel Town Depot Days,"Oct. 25th was Depot Days at Travel Town. An excellent event for young and young at heart. Volunteers gave tours of some train cars, Amtrak had the chef explaining the joys of dining on long distance trains, and there was information about the ""Harvey Girls"". My friends and I attended in our 1940 era best garb.We ate a picnic lunch with others folks in vintage attire. There was a band doing ""big band"" music - I even attempted a fox trot on the grass.Be sure to mark your calendars for this event next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliGal2013
50,Great place for little kids.,I was there with my son and grandchild. Great place to enjoy a box lunch and see the vintage trains. There is a train that you can ride on. Ticket price is around $2.50. There is a senior discount.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisz282
50,Amazing Railroad Museum,"As an amateur photographer, I love visiting Railroad museums anywhere I go. There is something rewarding about photographing trains, and LA's Travel Town is really one of the best examples of a functional and photogenic rail museum. I try visiting this place whenever I'm in town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterkT5094EC
40,Train Museum,"stopped here for a wee visit after seeing it on you tube. It was interesting to see the size of these locomotives. As a child I grew up with steam engines in Scotland but they were not as big as these. Plenty of seats to have a picnic and room for the children to run about. At the moment there is a small gift shop, they are in the process of building a new one which will be so much better. Great wee trip round on the miniature railway. 2 grand daughters had a great time. Restroom available. The museum is accessible for disabled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/svenskmum
40,Good train museum.,Lots of fun to take the grandson on the train ride. It would be really special if they had restored engines and rolling stock up and running. This would benefit from more funding!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leslie0447

30,A little upkeep could revive this treasure,"I guess some people would chide me for saying this, but I honestly feel that this park/museum would greatly benefit from an increased membership drive and a small entry fee. There is a lot of potential here - great trains, cute gift shop, and the interact with the exhibits. However, there is a lot to be desired. The exhibits inside the warehouse are falling apart and look dangerous to touch, the trains outside are mostly closed off and are in need of repair. The only train my guest and I were able to walk through was void of any authentic furnishings so there wasn't much to see.If you need a free place to take the kids so they can run around trains or if you just want to stroll around and take pictures of trains, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a true train museum, I would spend some cash and go elsewhere. There are plenty of other exhibits in the LA area that do a better job explaining the history of the railway here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoLocal
40,Great for Kids and Train Fans,This is a fun place to visit in cooler weather with children. It gets hot in the summer. There are lots of trains to climb on and open space to run around - a great place to exercise your children's minds and large muscles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janejets0n
50,Great place for picnic and let the kiddos run,"I am reluctant to write this as I feel like this is my secret gem. Every time I travel through Los Angeles with my kids I stop here to let them get some energy out. I get food and bring it to eat at this park. This is free to enter and look at all the large locomotives! If you child loves trains and has some Thomas/Brio/Chugginton engines let them bring them to play on the train track inside. If you want to ride the miniature train it is $2.75 per person and well worth it for my son! He loved it! It was quite hot when I went but if you visit the gift shop the A/C is running and you can get a quick recharge and head back out. We set out a blanket for a few minutes under the trees and had a really nice rest as the kids ran around and got rid of some energy. There are park benches all over with plenty of shade. The yellow jackets are quite prevalent so be prepared, especially if your kid is allergic (F.Y.I.)! Other than that this is my son's favorite park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2034PItomg
50,"fun, cheap","I hadn't been here since I was a kid, but it's still fun!. IF I had little kids I'd bring them here all the time! A great, place, much bettter than going to Universal studios- gag. And cheaper",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyak521
40,Great place for Train Enthusiast and for Small Children,This is a great place to take youngish kids to. They are wowed by the trains and the ability to get on and off and pretend that they are driving! It is fun and exciting for them. The gift shop is nice and always a must at the end of the visit. The train ride around the train park is very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Swisscss
50,My Grandson Birthday at Traveltown,"Celebrated my grandson b-day. The place is very interesting for the young kids to explore. Many old train and a little museum. The train ride was nice.

50,"Trains, Trains and More Trains","I've always loved making the drive to come here, my son like to ride on the little train that takes you around the park. Even if you don't have kids its a great way to get some nice photos of all the trains.Bring cash because even though the train ticket booth and the souvenir shop take cards the hot dog guy selling hot dogs, drinks and ice cream well he only takes cash. There is no fee for entry or parking which is a rare thing in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
30,Old trains in various states of repair,"If you are a train buff you might find travel town interesting. There are many old trains in various states of repair. Kids would probably enjoy an hour here. There are many other attractions in Griffith Park, such as the zoo, hiking trails with phenomenal views of the city and San Fernando Valley, and the planetarium. that are much more interesting if you have limited time in Los Angeles. Travel Town might be more interesting to locals who already explored the other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820KurtB

50,Travel town,"My wife and I took the children to travel town up by Griffith Park, price was great, only a couple dollars per person with plenty to do, if you like trains from old time steamers to modern day ones this is the place to go,the children get to see how it was way back then compared to today's modern day travel, they get to go in the engines and passenger cars of both to see the difference, there is also a place to have a picnic, birthday party and so much more, check it out it's fantastic and plenty to do. Have Fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X2199XRjohnd
30,Vintage Trains in Griffith Park,"This FREE museum is located on the north side of Griffith park just off the 134. The train museum is in a little rough shape but there are a few interesting trains to see and a few that you can walk inside. There is also a kiddie train that you can buy tickets for. Overall, I wouldn't go out of your way but its a good place to take in a little bit of transportation history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciaj327
50,Very cool train park,"This place is pretty awesome. If you are the slightest bit into trains, you will love this place. First off, the place is free! How can a place this cool not charge an entrance fee? Oh well, better for you and me. The parking lot isn't huge,  and it was rather full the day we came,  but we didn't manage to find a spot inside. They have quite a few trains to see, ranging from locomotives, box cars, passenger cars,  and cabooses.  I'm not an expert on trains so I'm sure there are other types of cars there too. You can actually go inside a few which is cool thing.  Seeing these bad boys in person give you a feel of just how massive these things are.  They are actually quite large.  I like that they give you a little history on each car or locomotive,  which gives you an idea where and when they were used.  They had some passenger cars from Hawaii, which just made me imagine how cool it would have been traveling around the islands riding on one of those things. I like that they have tracks everywhere and a train stop. My girls had fun just walking on the tracks.  At least you didn't have to worry about being hit by a train! My girls favorite part was the little 2 dollar train ride that takes you around the perimeter of the park.  They actually take you around more than once,  so it was a fun little trip for the kids.Overall an awesome little train park, and best of all it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tygerstile
40,Someone else must have bouth the rights to Train Town,"This is a wonderful little attraction dedicated to trains. There are retired full size train engines from the past and fun minature train that circles the park. Both admission and parking are free. In addtion to the trains, it is also entertaining to watch the competing picnic table based brithday parties. Family and budget friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bryanbZ3939PG
40,Trains,This is a little like a train graveyard. There are several train cars and rails to climb on and play. There is a small museum & gift shop. There are bathrooms. I have been here a few times for kids' birthday parties and then we had a small picnic/party for our engagement here. It's busy with kids running all around for the most part.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet
50,Who Knew Trains Were So Neat,What a great little place to learn about old trains. They also have a little train that goes around the museum for a small fee. The entrance itself is free. Visiting from out of town and highly recommend this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523heathern
40,Fun for kids,"This was a great place to take kids to play on a nice day. However, most of the exhibits you cannot climb on or touch. Fun free attraction for people who are interested in the history of the train as transportation. There is a nominal fee to ride the mini train, but the kids that were riding looked like they were really enjoying themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetSetFiend
50,Full of memories!,I first came here over 40 years ago and I still love this place! We even rode the train! Children and adults alike will enjoy the park. The Trains and Cinema exibit is fantastic! Don't forget the gift shop... we bought his and hers engineers hats for the grandkids!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doozer2015
50,Fun at the railway park,We love to visit parks with our grandchildren. This park which was built in the 1950s is dedicated to early Southern California history and allows everyone to climb aboard various passenger cars and the engines that pulled them. it is free unless you decide to take the small train which circles the park. It is well worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/402dougd
50,Great place for kids as well as adults!,"Travel Town truly is a ""hidden gem"" in the backlot of Griffith Park! For the kids, there is the miniature train ride which circles the park twice, the gift shop, numerous birthday party areas, and the signature steam trains which the kids can climb on. But don't assume this is only a childrens' ""kiddie park"" either! For the adults/ train buffs, there are numerous placards on every train at the park, describing its history as well as some interesting facts.The Saturday i went on, they were offering Guided Tours inside three of the Union Pacific passenger cars. I hopped on just before they were closing for lunch at 12.30 pm. We went through a sleeping car, lounge car, and dining car! It was awesome! I asked our guide if they offered any other tours, and he said they had a sleeping car named ""Hunters Point"" that they open once a year for the public. Because I was on the last tour group before they closed for lunch, he decided to take me inside the ""Hunters Point"" car, showing me the compartment where Leo DiCaprio sat for the filming of ""J. Edgar!"" I was not expecting THAT! I was amazed at how caring this volunteer tour guide was, so I dropped $40 in their donation box while going back. (Yeah, their tours are free, but they ask for donations to restore the trains. Initially, i gave them $5, but after the exclusive tour, i came back and dropped in $40.) I think tours are every Saturday, and although they are ""free,"" don't be one of those cheapskates who would go by without paying. Appreciate the hard-working volunteers and their efforts, and donate at least $5! (Also try asking them to go inside the ""Hunters Point"" car, it was a real treat for me!)Overall, it's a fabulous place for children and adults alike to come and enjoy the big trains. There's something for everyone here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike9906

50,Great Fun for Kids and Adults,Travel Town is a real treat for the whole family and soo un-LA!Our grandkids loved the trains and activities. Nine place to spend the day on a lovely LA afternoon without the crowed or slick presentation. Real people sharing their enthusiasm for trains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VimMcG
50,Classic good time with kids,"FREE! That is huge. We went on a Saturday, ate a picnic lunch, and looked at trains. There was a free tour through a sleeping car, lounge car, and dining car. Very interesting stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbarre715
30,A Nice Collection of Historic Transport,"My first visit visit here was when i was 4 years old in 1964. The place was awesome. You could climb on every Steam Engine, walk through every Caboose, and Passenger car and Street cars too. The indoor museum housed Antque cars, trucks and road contruction equipment. The air collection consisted of a German V1 rocket from world war 2, a Navy jet fighter called a Cutless and a Cold War Antisubmarine patrol plane called the P2V Neptune. The Neptune yiu could climb inside.Travel town was the place to have your Birthday too.Now it is just a glimmer of its former glory. The Passenger cars are vacant of their appointments that the railroads gave them the Steam Engines are no longer climbable unless they want you to. The aircraft display is fenced in and the indoor display is all but vacant. I was disappointed with the way the museum has been managed. It is still great collection of railroad pieces, but it needs a lot if TLC to bring it back to its former glory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertlS6174DM
40,Great for free!!,"We are a bunch of train enthusiasts and absolutely loved this place! The mini train is adorable and perfect for our kids (and us too!), and the collection of train cars and locomotives was impressive. I would have enjoyed seeing the inside of more of the cars (I was sad to not see the inside of the Union Pacific dining car) but I understand the need for preservation. I also enjoyed the ample signage and information about each car, it made my history heart very happy. Perfect free attraction for the family!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globeteach
30,Good spot for young train enthusiasts,My son is obsessed with trains (especially Thomas). He was in good company at this park. He enjoyed the little train ride and climbing around in the engine of a real steam locomotive. Gift shop full of train goodies too (he is still dreaming about the train tattoos he got). Lots of birthday parties for fellow young train enthusiasts going on there too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136emilyb
50,Nice and pleasant,"On our first stop on our 10 year anniversary, we stopped at the travel town train park. It was interesting seeing all the old trains. Some of the trains do have some wear and tear on them but are fixing them as best they can. It also has tons of space to eat and relax. Its free and you cant beat that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hylianknight
40,Nice free attraction,"Nice free event to do with the kids. Ample parking, clean restrooms, and plenty of space for kids to run free. My kids enjoyed climbing on a train and riding the small one for a fee. This place would be nicer if it had a playground in it. There were a lot of active kids running around and most of the trains were off limits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belindam
30,"Budget-Friendly, Interesting Exhibits","This free attraction at Griffith Park includes many historic trains. Unfortunately, only a couple of trains allow guests to climb aboard. The exhibits are definitely out-dated and taken care of on a shoestring budget. There is a small train that can be enjoyed for a fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmyE631
50,Classic Trains on View at Museum,"Signage to Travel Town Museum could be better in the greater Griffith Park. Getting to the Museum was made even more challenging with road closures. However, don't give up, it was an interesting and fun site, especially for a train buff, You can't beat the price of free to have access to all of these classic pieces of equipment. The kids and kids at heart will also enjoy the ride on the miniature train for a very reasonable price. It is great that kids and adults have a chance to learn about railroad history at this site. You can also enjoy the lovely wooded site as you rest between touring the various segments of the museum. Glad to hear that there is continuing restoration of the equipment, which is sorely needed to keep these icons of transportation in good shape. There are locomotives, freight cars, cabooses, passenger cars, interurbans and motorcars on display. A couple of our favorites were an antique circus car and a horse drawn Los Angeles Railway Car built about 1880.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob-a-Link

50,Travel Town a family favorite.,"Ever since I was a child my family has been coming here. You can crawl all over the trains! There is a running train to ride. The beauty of the trains, even if a bit dusty, is perfectly clear. I love seeing kids geek out at being able to touch the iron horses kept here. It is a classic kids place. Not to be missed if you have anyone into trains even a little bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deabs8
40,Fun visit with the kids,"As museums go, I want to like this travel town more. But the equipment is in fair to poor condition, and the variety is limited. Still, as a lover of all things to do with trains, I do appreciate that this place is even here. The model train exhibit is run by volunteers, and looks to be a fun setup. Even there though, I think it could be presented in a more accessible format.The highlight of Travel Town is the mini train ride that runs around the perimeter of the museum. It's great for little kids and a great value at $3 per person. This is the perfect place for a Father'sday celebration, or kid's birthday party (if he or she is into trains).As I say, it has potential to be so much more. But for what it is, it's worth a visit just for the train ride. Be sure to visit the other train club down the road, which is also run by volunteers and often holds special events during the Holidays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tourpilot
50,"Some equipment needs TLC, but it's still pretty cool","Went over to Travel Town after visiting the observatory last sunday. While this place may not meet the standards of York or Strasburg, there is still some interesting trains on display here. Outside are lots of old steam locomotives and passenger cars. Inside the barn, there are more freight cars and antique vehicles. Some of them seem to be slightly showing age as stated below:* The San Francisco Cable car looks faded and like something pulled from the scrapyard.* The wood on the wheels of a couple of wagons inside is a bit chipped.* A tank car is showing some rust.* The paint on a Union Pacific dining car is peeling.* The front board on one of the small logging steam locomotives is partially split in half.Also, among the equipment under the wooden shelter, there is a Stockton Terminal Eastern Pacific steam locomotive that bears a resemblance to the ones that operate at Disneyland, but there was no lable anywhere with information on what the type of locomotive it was. But othern than that, this is still a cool museum and admission is free. There is a miniature train that goes around the perimeter of the museum grounds, but we didn't go on that (you have to pay to do that). Also inside, there is an interesting model train layout with Union Pacific and Amtrak trains moving along it at the back just behind the kids area (didn't notice it the first time around). The museum grounds seem to be popular for birthday parties since one of the passenger cars was reserved for one. You can couple this with the observatory and you have got two free attractions in one park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan01
50,Loved all the Choo-Choo Trains!,"Excellent place... and FREE!!!

Off we go. A plus not to have to pay to get in. If you are in photography you can really get some great shots showing all the pieces they have on display. The trains are life size and so are the autos and carts from the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pjtravels3
40,Sixty Years Later,"My parents took my two brothers and I to Travel Town in 1954. I was 10 years old and those steam engines look 50 feet tall. I stopped by the other day just to see what it looked like some 60 years later. They have added more rail cars and locomotives and created a park-like atmosphere with plenty of picnic tables, restrooms and displays. It is still free and a great place for kids of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Free Trains,"A great place to take kids and train enthusiast. It is free, including a large parking lot. There is a small train that chugs around the whole attraction which costs $2.25 a person, but you don't have to do that part. It is basically a train yard of all kinds of old trains open to climb on and around and under. There is open lawn for picnicing and clean bathrooms. There is indoor space with old cars and an extensive model train exhibit. Go early and often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panama2000

There is an outdoor setting for old steamers and an indoor are for some old train cars, fire trucks and other railroad vehicles. There is also a window view for model trains which is currently being rebuilt where could spend hour watching some nice models going by. Then there is a train ride all around the park which costs $2.5. Gift store (train oriented) and a few pick-nick tables for parties are also there. At the gift store you could borrow a few train toys if your little one wishes to play on one of the train tables and forgot to bring any wooden trains from home.The nice thing is kids get to claimb on the old steam engine and take a look at how they were built.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostAngeles

Around holiday time they decorate the area with some decorations to make it even nicer.Next they have some authentic old trains for the public to view. There are some old engines, passenger cars etc. from years gone by. Some of them you can even climb inside and get a closer look.Finally they have an indoor area with a really nice miniature toy train set with a pretty elaborate landscape.

50,Wow!,"My wife, 2 year old son, and I went to Travel Town after we went on a ride on the Southern Railroad at Griffith Park. It was perfect for us to go to Southern Railroad and then the Travel Town! It was almost like a little warm up.Of course, my son was obsessed with the trains there and he loved going up inside the train cars. It was a great place to hang out inside trains, learn some history, and also go on a little train ride. We were amazed at how great this location turned out to be. I would say that it is one of the gems that is hidden inside LA for younger kids.If you get the opportunity, take your child to Travel Town, located in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NateM_13
40,Nice little park,"Nice little park with some cool engines. Great for little ones that love trains. There is a little inside area that has a train table, but make sure to bring your own trains. There were a lot of old engines that were really interesting. They had a few that they were renovating that would have been cool to see. Best thing was that it was free. With that said, take the kids for a ride on the train, buy something from the gift shop, or drop a few dollars in the donation box to keep this great place going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VangFamily

50,Train Enthusiasts Delight!,"Travel Town is a wonderfully educational destination if you want to learn about the history of steam powered locomotives. Picturesque setting with several actual trains from different eras of times long gone...some you can step up and see all of the workings of these beautiful Iron Horses...others are roped off for safety. There's a pint size train to take you on a mile long ride, lovely gift shop with every train imaginable for purchase and a park like setting complete with grills to have yourself a family BBQ gathering! We will definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikaI_12
50,Great place for kids!,Kids will love all of the trains here as they get to climb aboard them. It's like taking a step back into time. The small little museum is full of interesting things to see. It's a great place to learn and spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,Over 50 years of great displays!,"First time I went as a teen was far too long ago, some thing have changed, but the trains keep you interested all day. Being of age to remember 'steam', it is enjoyable look back in time and how we 'made' things here and got around on those giant machines - in comfort! The 'crew' of volunteers helped everyone with everything. Take the train ride! Check out the model train operation. I'll keep coming back with I am in state int he future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnD46
50,What a gem of a find!,"Driving on the freeway we happened to see this so we made a point of visiting. What a unique find too! They have locomotives, passenger cars, caboose & box cars to view as well as an indoor museum to view vehicles of the past. Beautiful maintained grounds with picnic tables throughout and you can ride the miniature train around the grounds for a nominal fee. Plenty of free parking. Well worth stopping by to visit. And easy to find right off the freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
50,Travel Town (Steam Engines) Museum,"What a fun place to go to!!! If you have even a small interest (like me) in trains, you will enjoy this place. There is no charge for entry (a donation is requested but not an obligation), which - being from Chgo where everything costs $$ - was a very nice surprise. A ride on a train - similar to that at a local zoo - costs only $2.50/adult; $2.00/child or senior. Well worth the cost!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scintoshelly
50,Travel Town is a great destination for children and adult children.,"Travel Town, a part of Griffiths Park, in Glendale, CA has a superb collection of steam locomotives, passenger cars and work vehicles, including an old Red Car. And, thanks to Thomas the Tank Engine, a huge following of 2-5 year old fans. They rent out space for birthday parties and are ideal for young children. A child size train takes them on rodes areound the park and adult train fans will enjoy the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamackay
50,"If you have a 1-7 yr old, it's one of LA's best free attractions.","If you have a kid that loves trains (I have two), well this is the place to go. It's free. They have tons of trains to look at, climb on, and even a small one you can ride ($2.50/person). I don't know why people don't come here more often. Lots of birthday parties on the weekend, but there is still plenty of space for everybody.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW
50,Great for kids,I was surprised that this was a) free and b) not completely swarming with kids on a lovely Saturday afternoon. This is located in Griffith Park and it a good way for train enthusiasts to spend an hour or two. There are a number of steam engines on display and some good hands-on activities for kids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alligeek
50,Lots of fun - for free,It's a lovely place to visit aith the kids. Many locomotives. You can climb in to two of them. A little indoor exhibit. A little play train track (you can get trains to play with at the gift shop - leave an ID). They have a little train running around the grounds. Two loops for 2.50$. was fun bet the other train in Griffith park is slightly more interesting.We had a very good couple of hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicahS_12
50,Great place for kids and adults,Ths place is so much fun you can get up close and personal with some big trains and your kids will love it. My kid went crazy running around and easy access from the fwy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankS614
50,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this place.,"We visited this free attraction, while ""browsing"" through Griffith Park. What a neat place! If you or your children are the least bit interested in trains, take them here. Some of the locomotives were over 100 years old and you could go inside a couple of the cars. You could feel that history when you looked at all of the cars and engines.Most everything was outside except for a few exhibits inside a hangar sort of building. There was also a small train ride that we rode. It was also cute seeing a preschool visiting there on a field trip that day.There was also a small gift shop - mostly toys and trinkets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaC
40,"Cheap, fun for train fans","I grew up in the LA area and only now that I have moved away and have kids come here. There are two trains in Griffith Park, but after some recommendations came to this one because it has the Travel town museum. We came on a Saturday morning around 10:30. It wasn't too busy and there was plenty of parking (free). There's a little gate into the museum with a guy who gives information and stuff. You walk down a little path to a wonderful collection of trains. Many have steps so the kids can check out the interiors. The day we went, there was a group of staff/volunteers pulling trains in and out of the shed, so it was interesting to see them switching tracks, putting sand down, coupling and uncoupling trains. There's also a ""barn"" with train cars, gift shop and museum. The primary reason we came was so our son (3.5 y/o) could ride the train. It's a cute little diesel replica that pulls covered open air cars around the perimeter of Travel town. For $2.50 you go around twice and it's a nice ride and you can see the grounds and trains from a different angle. Bathrooms were reasonably clean the day we went. Gift shop was stocked with fun toys, clothes and books. They have a little train table in there that the kids can play with in there. If there aren't any trains on the table they can borrow them at the register.Bottom line - Very fun and easy for a morning outing.Tips -* It can be hot here - sunscreen, hat, and water* The grounds are stroller friendly - except the giftshop which is tiny.* There is a hand crank penny smashing machine, so bring quarters and pennies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marmac_10
40,Good opportunity to learn about trains...,"The area is FREE of admission or parking fees, except if you want to take rides (normally under $4 each). Great Museum containing lots of interesting exhibits and information. Located close to LA Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJ928
50,Its Free!! and really fun,"So L.A. can be an expensive place for a vacation but this little hidden gem is FREE!!! I had time to kill on a recent buisness training trip to Burbank and I did a quick search and up popped this place. Now if your kids are Thomas or Chuggington fans this place is a MUST SEE. Great gift shop,Mini train rides you can go in and climb all over most of the trains. I was an adult by myself and I enjoyed my time there. It is free but I suggest make a donation to keep the place going :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZR6Lady
40,"Easy, cheap, quick and cute!","We stopped into travel town this afternoon for the first time. There was plenty of free parking, the staff was very friendly, and my boys loved climbing around the steam engines and riding the miniature train around the perimeter of the museum. It was easily ""do-able"" in an hour or so, and was small enough that I could let my boys run up ahead of me and not worry that they were going to get lost or take a wrong turn. This is a definite must-see for train lovers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brettandanne
50,Free and great for a couple hours,"If you have kids that are interested in trains or love trains yourself, like me, Travel Town is awesome. Free parking and no admission. There are a lot of older trains and train cars donated from railroads all over the place. It is great because you can climb up into some of the engines. I love travel town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dodg1988
50,Choo Choo,"FREE Anytime. FREE Parking. $2 per person for the train ride.I love this place. I had my sons 2 year old birthday party here. I didn't rent a caboose. Group was small. I brought picnic food, water, and blankets for us to sit on the grass. Lots of shade.Make sure your kids bring small trains to play with. They have Train Table for them. I gave little trains for the kids to play wrapped in a bandanna along with snacks. My son was in awe of the trains and being able to walk on the tracks. After lunch we paid for everybody to get on the train. The toddlers LOVED it and I loved how easy it was.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalpcktmemories
