50,Gallery/museum,"This amazing place is a commercial gallery with a museum-size space, and museum-style exhibitions. Their comprehensive show are extrordinary, and always worth a visit. (Philip Guston currently showing) Parking isn't easy, but it's worth the effort. (Other galleries are on the adjacent block, and a good choice of restaurants are nearby.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrybraun33
50,Grand Galleries,"This is worth a visit while in LA. The galleries are free and have rotating exhibits. This was my second time to visit the galleries and they had new exhibits that are world-class. The docents are very knowledgable and will answer your question. While we were there they just walked up to us and informed us of some of the aspects of art we were not aware of. There is a great gift shop and bookstore as well. Manuela's is an excellent restaurant inside the galleries I would highly recommend. make reservations. Parking is a little tough, there is valet you have to pay for but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst
50,Great experience,"Everything about a visit to Hauser and Wirth is enriching. I visited 3 times in July and August. On the first visit I took in the exhibits, admired the creative re-use of the great old building, a lovely restaurant surrounded by plants situated next to the open exhibit courtyard, the wonderful kitchen garden with chickens and picnic tables, a small shop with unique gifts, and great bookstore. The second visit was to more intensely concentrate on one of the exhibits, and third visit was to briefly show an out of town guest the gallery. Additionally, the Arts District location is very nice, and convenient to Little Tokyo metro stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLP-eastcoast
40,Incredible space for art and a bite to eat...,"On the whole this is an incredible space for art and a bite to eat. I really was blown away by the architecture and it was cool to wander the galleries. It's free and it's not massive, so you don't get overwhelmed.However, I removed one *star* because I was really turned off by the main installation, which was meant to reflect the homelessness crisis. It is a ""tent city"" exhibition. I understand the artist's intention to create an exhibit that forces the viewer to confront the present problems, but is it necessary to replicate a situation that exists just blocks away from the gallery? I would have preferred for the artist and gallery to use the funds and space to help support actual homeless people or initiatives. This exhibit seemed like the artist was almost exploiting the problem to raise his own profile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethp938
40,Still the epicenter of the Art District,"Naturally, the visit will be more to visit the little unique book store and use the brilliant restaurant Manuela. This time we managed to stop by when the galleries were closed for change of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
40,Great addition to the Arts District,"I first visited the gallery soon after opening when locating the door was an adventure.Now, the complex in addition to 3 galleries, a large courtyard, bookstore, shop and a garden has a good restaurant. So it makes for a nice outing. Come for some art.... stay for a meal. Browse books. The exhibitions change often. No entry fee. Several new shops have opened in the area. Enjoy the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,"A wonderful gallery in Downtown Los Angeles, Free experience with changing exhibits","The Hauser & Wirth Gallery in downtown Los Angeles is one of the Jewels of the downtown area. The gallery is free of charge and there are ever changing exhibits of famous artists. I have attended two different artist showings and glad I was invited by my daughter. One must make reservations thru their web site. There is no charge to this venue, but this is a way to control the volume of daily visitors.There are several exhibit rooms and courtyards to visit other than the main exhibit hall. The old Globe Metal Flour's complex is utilized for this gallery. The restaurant inside the courtyard was closed at the time of our visit.You can take photos, but no flash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627edj
40,A wonderful gallery complex in re-imagined industrial area of LA.,"This is quite a complex! As the industrial area gentrifies near Skid Row, imaginative people have taken the initiative to create a gallery complex that houses avant-garde art.I enjoyed the Alexander Calder exhibit but I found the Julian Rosefeldt Manifesto a little too bizarre. We did not try the restaurant but it looked inviting and pretty hip.Very cool development, worthwhile seeking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waterloonie
40,The Arts District comes alive,"I have rarely gone to downtown when visiting LA because of its usual unsavory reputation but it's changed quite a bit especially with the gentrification of the area. A friend of mine took me to Hauser & Wirth and it's a huge structure that houses an art gallery, a restaurant, some shops, a garden. Art is subjective so i won't comment on that but I saw the line-up and its pretty diverse so there would be something to appeal to art lovers. I personally enjoyed the exhibits in mixed media when I went. The gallery itself is very airy with lots of light, very high ceilings and I appreciated the fact that they kept the original structure intact and fitted out the insides. The airconditioning in the gallery was very comfortable especially on a hot day and at least so far, entry is free. Knocked down a rating because parking is really a problem [I parked a kilometer away] being expensive and a bit hard to find. The upside is the place is close to the Union Station stop which my friend took. So that's always an alternative. The place has potential to house private events and hopefully it will retain artistic truth and not become a pretentious venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpk325
30,Great physical venue; art must be to your taste,"The venue itself is interesting and trendy-- there are a few gallery rooms, two separate outdoor areas, and an outdoor restaurant. The grounds were great but the modern art exhibit that we saw was not our taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValerieFern
40,Interesting place,"This is actually my first art gallery, I always to a museum. The location in this gallery was very unique, but parking was ehh in my opinion. Would go again for future exhibits though,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangjennifer3
40,A little hard to describe,"Gallery, shop with exclusive selection of beautiful things, great restaurant, a large outdoor garden, many events. This has made it the area's most visited attraction",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,It's an art gallery but you'll think you visited a museum.,"This is the world's largest art gallery in sheer space. The quality of the work shown here is up to that level as well. The building had been an old flour mill and the conversion to a gallery, restaurant and outdoor spaces as well make this one of the most memorable places to visit in Los Angeles. Best of all its open on Sundays when galleries are usually closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffe665
50,Art Complex Gallery Restaurante,Downtown in the art area of Los Angeles I stopped in to see Paul McCarthy artwork sculpture and it was not in the first Gallery which was extraordinary but two other galleries across the courtyard Open Sky passed a fabulous restaurant bar place to settle your brain after some amazing overwhelming art. Every aspect of the place just took me by my shirt and shook me and I want to come back the next time I'm in LA. The particular show Paul McCarthy artwork was sculpted wood huge and really quite something to behold. Afterwards a glass of wine and a plate of lunch we all just had the best time and reluctantly left at closing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwanderX
40,Beautiful space,Beautiful space interesting art installations. Visited while having brunch at ManuelaThe neon exhibit was interesting and I loved the rose sculpture and the gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindas286
50,Great addition to Los Angeles,"Really glad I came here, and was very impressed with the gallery, restaurant, courtyard, garden and book store. Very friendly staff. This is a great addition to the art community of Los Angeles. An added touch to the art district just east of Little Tokyo. Look forward to going there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsC7805SY
40,Amazing beautiful space,"The architecture alone is worthwhile, this is a phenomenal example of re-appropriation.I wasn't blown away by the new collections but the Miro exhibit was awesomeEat at Manuela for a delightful palette and service",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardtB2728CE
50,Highly recommend,"This is art for people who don't want to wait in massive lines to see too much stuff they know nothing about. The three galleries for their first exhibition were well chosen with wonderful examples of women sculptors. The explanations are minimal and well chosen, the space is beautiful and old and I can't wait till their restaurant and public garden are open. Will definitely be back for their next exhibition. Plus it's in a busy and bright downtown area where you can eat drink and party all day if you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annied260
30,Very mixed Bag,"Great building complex but mediocre opening exhibition aside from the very good Ruth Asawa pieces. The employees, all forced to wear the requisite black, quite helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanR27
50,Chill vibes,"I didn't quite know what to expect when a friend of mine asked me to meet up with him at this out of the way gallery in the Arts District of LA. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a open hallway with what appeared to be some sort of usher/bouncer at the front entrance. The entire area here was restored from it's days gone by into a seemingly swanky part of the Arts District where people come to dance, people watch and have a good time. Everything from the bathrooms to the open air courtyard were a mix of new and old, the old bricks can still be seen on the walls inside the men's toilets. There was a food truck on hand that sold some weird but tasty knish type of food. People from all walks of life came to dance to whatever sounds the DJ was playing. A mix of old school and new school music was in full effect. Rows of huge tables and benches were everywhere for those needing a rest. I didn't bother to browse any of the galleries near the front entrance, so that will be for another time.This place was a good first introduction to the mysterious Arts District of LA. The day I visited was a Thursday, and there was a lively bunch of people out, so I can only imagine once the weekend rolls around! This should be your first stopping point visiting this eclectic area of Downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33EricH
50,Whoa!,"Blue-chip art presented in a sequence of historic spaces in the DTLA arts district. The spaces range from the immaculate to scruffy, and intimate to a public patio suitable for presidential inaugurations. Fantastic bookstore with books on contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aefenspraec
