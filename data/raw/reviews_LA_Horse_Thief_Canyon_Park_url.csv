Very nice playground, a track and football area next door with some climbing ""fake"" rocks.One bad experience 2 years ago. We were taking pictures and a equestrian lady came up and threatened to call the police if we didn't leave. We were in the public area but she claimed it was for horses. I only regret I didn't stand my ground and let the police set her straight that it is a public park and not private property. But the park itself is great.",John P
