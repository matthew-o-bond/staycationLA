40,"Went to visit Sophia Pertrillo - ""picture it""","I am a long-time fan of The Golden Girls, and like so many fans, had a great affection for Estelle Getty. I wanted to visit her grace in Hollywood Forever and say ""hello"". Walking through this immaculately kept cemetery was both inspiring and sad. We couldn't get in to see the tomb of Judy Garland (we had to peer through the glass) but we did see hundreds of monuments of many famous and less-than famous people. It seems that after about a generation. many of the monuments are left unvisited. I guess that is the way of things, but it also made me wonder about all the money spent on the large and lavish monuments. Looking at Estelle Getty's simple headstone, I felt the power of the words inscribed - ""With love and laughter"" - came from her long and well-lived life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SydneyPaul
40,Good Service at a Time of Need,All arrangements were handled efficiently. Many members of my family as well as friends are buried here. The grounds are kept well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovevacationtime
20,It was actually really boring,It was actually really boring. It was interesting for maybe 10 minutes tops before we wanted to leave.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewb332
50,LOU's NEWS,"A walk back in time. Many of Hollywood's famous luminaries are buried here. Close to Paramount Studios. Historically speaking, interesting. Wear comfortable shoes or sneakers. Flower Shop sells a who's who book on the famous at an affordable price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louiee361
50,Nice stroll in the cemetery,It's a nice and calm place to walk around and spot some famous graves on the way. Recommended if you're around that part of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
40,Paying Homage to Hollywood,"Please remember this is an actual, active cemetery. We watched far too many folks tromp around while there were services being held and families were tending to plots. But in terms of history, Judy Garland has been moved here, Rudolph Valentino still rests here, and there are peacocks, geese and ducks wandering around the grounds. It's a quiet place to spend a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,Music in the cemetery - Masonic Lodge,"A lot of people come to see the famous movie & music stars buried in the cemetery. While that is indeed cool, this review focuses on the Masonic Lodge at the cemetery where they hold music events.The masonic lodge is located inside the cemetery to the left when you go inside the front gates. There are parking lots available as well as parking along the roads inside the cemetery - parking is free. Usually the concerts are artsy bands. The lodge is historic (built in 1927) and has stairs that you need to go up to the concert hall (and down when you leave) - there is no elevator.Acoustics in the hall are very good and it holds about 150. It is all general admission. We have gone to two shows - the last one earlier this year. They let you in to the show about 1/2 hour before and a line forms outside (can get chilly) until that time. We got there about 1 hour before the show and had about 20 people ahead of us.After you get up to the concert hall there is a foyer which has some drinks & snacks and swag if the band is selling. Also bathrooms are up here.When we have gone there were metal chairs in the main section as well as padded benches around the rooms up against the walls - we like these areas - get in early and get them if you can. Although they are off a little to the side, these are raised up a little higher than the chairs.Have fun and enjoy the music!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenLeCreate
50,We drove by with our tour,"We learned so much through our tour guide. This was not a stop for us so we could not go in, but it was fantastic hearing about the cemetery and who is buried in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hollywood_Help
40,A cemetery out of the ordinary,This is a pretty cool place to visit but there are a few things I wish I would've known in advance. One being that you can drive your car into the cemetery (this place is huge). We ended up walking a bit more than we anticipated. The second is that you should really have a map or a guide to take you through because it operates just like any other cemetery and it can be tricky to find someone you're looking for. Beautiful place that's still in operation today so it's best to be respectful during your visit. Navigation wasn't very intuitive but it was otherwise a great visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
40,"Nice, peaceful, touristy place","Good place to take my friend from England that I never even considered. A directory with an easy access may would've been nice but not sure how appropriate that is. At least something online would be nice. After all, you do have concerts there anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemP4946WY
50,The Pere LaChaise of Punk,"Hollywood Forever is one of my favorite places. It's so beautiful, relaxing and though the people may be dead, you're accompanied by live peacocks roaming free and a pond of turtles, ducks and swans that hatch new babies every spring so if you mushy when you see a line of fluffy ducklings following their mom or a group of turtles kicking it in the sun, this is a must visit. There is even a resident peacock who likes to fan his feathers for the cameras and will actually pose for you on a good day. If you're a punk fan, HF is the Pere LaChaise of the US homing the spirits of two Ramones, Runaways manager Kim Fowley and Bianca Halsted of Betty Blowtorch. Rozz Williams ashes are in an earn in one of the buildings and other campy characters like Warhol Superstar Holly Woodlawn and the original Toto from Wizard of Oz are also commemorated here. They also have cool events like the annual Johnny Ramone tribute, summer movie nights in the cemetery, concerts and an extensive Day of the Dead festival every year. I recommend it as a picnic spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrueReviewLA
50,Nice Walking Tour of Hollywood Forever Cemetery,"We took the walking tour of Hollywood Forever Cemetery and the tour guide Karie Bible provided a OUTSTANDING tour! The tour lasted about 2 and a half hours and it could've gone longer but there is only so much she can cover but the stories she did tell us were very interesting. There are many famous people buried in this cemetery and she covers many of them but she also gives you some stories that you might not know. She is very knowledgable and interested in this subject she is discussing so she makes it very interesting and entertaining in a respectful way for her tour visitors.The tour cost $20 but it's well worth it. We had about 20 - 25 people in our tour group and preverybody appeared to be really enjoying it. She covers the stories behind Rudolph Valentino, Judy Garland, Don Adams, Darren McGavin and many others to name a few. If you have never been to this cemetery then this is a great way to see it. If you been there before it's a great way to learn more about it. I thought I knew a lot about the people buried here but after taking her tour I had a lot to learn. Just a footnote she generally doesn't cover any people who recently died in the past few years out of respect to the family. She does the tour with great respect to the people buried there.Her tours are generally only on Saturdays at 10am. I'm not sure if she offers other types of tours or private tours. Her phone number is 818-517-5988. If you take the tour you will not regret it. If you attend this tour during a hot day I would recommend sunscreen and wear a hat or bring a umbrella.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,"Uniquely beautiful, peaceful, resting place of Hollywood's famous","Highly recommend visiting the stunningly beautiful & peaceful Hollywood Forever Cemetery. It was so much larger than we expected, so even after 2 hours of our self-guided walking tour, we had not seen all the final resting places of celebrities on the map (that you can buy for $5 at the flower shop just inside the cemetery entrance). Inside the Judy Garland pavilion, next to her resting place of beautiful pink marble is a guest book to sign on one side, and a photograph of her and her children in a case on the other side. That was quite an experience. A sculpture of Toto is on the far side of the cemetery to forever memorialize him in The Wizard of Oz. Headstones and mausoleums are all so unique, and flowers are left by many devoted fans. Note that there are many stray cats and peacocks on the property! So glad we visited this beautiful place, as it was a truly memorable Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robleo
50,See gravesites of major stars or attend an event,We like Hollywood Forever events. There are occasional night time screenings on the lawn to attend or you can just go in and walk around to see the movie star's grave sites. Also there are a lot of newer grave stones with photos of the deceased on them which we found interesting. The place is huge and there is plenty to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,Do Your Research!,"Oh how I love visiting this lovely place every time I’m in LA! The map purchased from the office is fine, but do an online search to find who is buried where as it is a large place. No need to take a tour, just take your time. The mausoleums are the size of schools and pretty impressive if you’re from a rural area like me. Must sees include Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Rudy Valentino, Chris Cornell (and as of September 2019 Valerie Harper is very close but still unmarked), the monument to Hattie McDaniel, Mel Blanc, ... the list goes on and on. The families of the non-famous diligently tend to their loved ones’ graves and they are fantastic! Remember the hours, as they do lock up at 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aymster71
50,A MUST SEE for a OLD MOVIE Fan!,"It is a beautiful cemetery and if you like old black and white movies you will find many people you know. It is the resting place of Cecil B. deMille and Hattie Moore and Rudolf Valentino, as well as some more modern stars like a rock star from the Ramones. It’s a fun adventure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,Many old movie stars are buried here!,"This cemetery has the tombs of many old time Hollywood stars such as Rudolph Valentino, Judy Garland, Tyrone Powell, Mickey Rooney and Nelson Eddy. Interesting to browse among the tombs and see who's there. They also host movie nights during the summer and Halloween that people can attend in the open air.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maryannk877
30,Worth an Hour or so Visit That's It,"$5 for a map... fine... however, the map appeared to be outdated and missing a few names of stars buried here. Mostly a Jewish cemetery and not that many stars have their final resting place here. If you are a fan of old Hollywood stars this is for you. Otherwise if you are like me and stopped by to see a couple grave sites (Estelle Getty & Judy Garland) then do so and move on. Definitely not worth spending anymore than an hour or so here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILUVSOCAL
40,Great place to visit,"On the day I chose to go to Hollywood Forever Cemetery it was pouring with rain. Luckily all of the chapels were open so I could explore them until it stopped raining. Once the sun came out, it was a very beautiful place to visit. I bought the map from the onsite flower shop and the lady there was very knowledgeable, pointing out various famous graves. The main chapel mausoleum doesn’t open until 1000 but there were some groundskeepers checking on leaks and they let me in early. Lots of famous people from the olden days are buried here with a few newer ones. Peacocks roam around freely and there are water birds in the lake. Once you have finished in the cemetery, you can leave via the southern exit and walk straight to Paramount Studios. The cemetery is free to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisebQ9970PY
30,Not very well organized,"I took a visiting friend from Europe here, as it was listed in his Los Angeles tourist book as an interesting attraction. The grounds are fairly attractive & well-kept, but the draw here are the final resting places of many famous stars of Hollywood renown.To find these individual gravesites (and crypts), tourists must purchase a map from the flower shop on-site--but the map is not very accurate, and we had a lot of trouble finding many of the stars' gravesites. The map needs to be reworked & updated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb
50,Saw Sun Kil Moon perform at the Masonic Lodge there,"As other reviewers stated, the place is a quiet oasis in the bustling hype of LA. This review is for the Masonic Lodge located at the cemetery not the cemetery itself. The Masonic Lodge is a very small venue and is a wonderful place to see an artist you up close. Parking is along the gravesites, which is kind of different and lends a level of eerie to walking back to your car after the show in the pitch dark. The Lodge is located right as you enter the cemetery - we drove by it twice and finally had to ask the security guard. The regular seats are very uncomfortable. Instead, sit along the wall on the padded seats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeSuLu
50,Coolest cemetary for movies!,Have been here for films in the summer and Did De Los Muertos near Nov 1. Love this place!

30,Hollywood Forever Cemetary,I thought this would be interesting to see. The cemetery was not crowded with walking people or dead people. From what I had read and been told the cemetery was full. I am not a fan of cemeteries but seeing some of these tombstones and mausoleum's was interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grueninger_karen
50,Hollywood Forever Walking Tour is a must,"Anyone who wants to learn about Hollywood old and new should take the walking tour of this beautiful cemetery. The guide has been conducting tours for 17 years and is full of historical knowledge, little known facts, stories & scandals. It is conducted with the utmost respect & dignity while being very entertaining. Good walking shoes and the ability to be on your feet for a full 2.5 hours is crucial.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecG7564WU

20,Not sure why it is an attraction,"I honestly have no idea what I was visiting. It is a nice peaceful place, but not particularly beautiful or full of celebrity graves... I was expecting something like Recoleta in Buenos Aires, where you appreciate the architecture of the graves, but no.... just meh. I would not recommend spending time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RGN_7228
50,Highlight of my trip!,"First thing you should do when you enter the museum is go to the flower shop and buy the map for $5.00. We didn't and just drove around and then plopped ourselves down and walked around and saw lots of graves that we were interested in seeing but then revisited the area as we missed some. The cemetery is not huge so you can really do it in about 3-4 hours. It's beautiful and peaceful and has so many interesting spots. Water, peacocks, cats! It's not a must for a first time visit to LA but if you come frequently you need to come and visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zach84Jake62

20,Lack of solemnity,"Although some of the grave stones are interesting, all together it looks messy, it lacks any taste and solemnity. For me it was disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EvaF2Eva
40,Peacocks and stars! Wow!,Nice old cemetery. Very peaceful. We drove it with the map. Don't be cheap. Buy the $5 map. Much more difficult to find stars without. Streets are narrow with lots of cars so be prepared to drive slow. Judy Garland was tucked away in her own space but beautiful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nichellei
50,WOW!,"This by far was one of the highlights of my LA Trip. This cemetery has it all if you are a classic Hollywood and Music fan. Paying my respects to Estelle Getty, Rudolph Valentino, Judy Garland and Chris Cornell were on my bucket list. It is very peaceful here and just walking around was relaxing for me. If you go, plan on being here for hours and make sure you get a map because we missed quite a few despite our best efforts to try to find everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MafiaCatWoman
50,"Where peacocks, cats, and mausoleums live together in peaceful harmony","What a surprise. When my sister-in-law said we just MUST stop by the Hollywood Forever Cemetery I didn’t know what to think. It was lovely and we ended up having such a nice time we stayed for a couple of hours.Wandering quietly through the beautifully maintained grounds we did see a few familiar names and the stones marking their resting places, but that wasn’t a draw for us. The serenity and decorum of the cemetery was a welcome respite from what we had experienced in LA up until then. The peacocks were on parade, and the cats sat right nearby, neither giving a hoot about the other. I especially enjoyed visiting the huge crypt with preserved dioramas in honor or those whose remains lay there: vignettes of lives lives, including a marathoner’s medals; a couples’ shared lives (scrabble tiles, wedding photos, baby booties); a woman’s owl figurine collection. It was a beautiful reflection of past lives and very moving.I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys some peace and quiet in the hubbub of a major city, and who appreciates both the living as well as those who have come before us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamilia2018

50,A Must Visit Location for Tourists and LA Residents,"This Cemetery is a frequent place foooor me to just visit and walk around and to bring out-of town guests. It also has an annual service for Rudolph Valentino in August which is amazing. I know thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhe place so well that I can help touristsm who are loking for someone and can not find them even with their maps. My favorite grave belongs to Tyrone Power and it is one of the most beautiful tombs there.and it is right next to the pond. I always clean off the bench and dispose oof dead flowers. Then I talk to Tyrone. He wa a WW 11 Piolot aaaand he airlifted injured soldiers to safety even under the line of fire. I had a friend who missed getting on his plane by one person and it colored his life. I say to Tyrone ""Couldn't you have just gotten one moore person on your plane?"" The veteran died a few years ago and so many Veterans showed up and none of his close friends had any Idea howt tremendously decorated he was. His only complaint was not getting on that plane.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malibumaven

10,Total disappointment.,This has always been toted as “come see the resting places of the Hollywood greats”. What a con. I agree with others about the surly woman in the flower shop for the map AND the map is rubbish. The list on the back should be in numerical order not alphabetical. In the end we gave up and had a wander. In the legends section there were hardly any legends. Total waste of time. The best thing about the place was that a “restroom” was available and clean.Only taking map home cos it cost $5 otherwise that would be in the bin.Save yourself the time and go see something more worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenbA8197JW

40,Interesting place to see a concert,"Most reviews are about the cemetery itself. However, we only saw so much of it as we walked to our concert location coming to see a Beach House concert. I understand that many famous people, including Judy Garland, are buried here. And there are tours of the cemetery. However, this review is focused on this place as a concert location. The acoustics are what one might expect since this is not an amphitheater. You bring a blanket or a tarp, sit or lie down, have a picnic, and listen to the music. No deck chairs or other kind of chairs are permissible. Disregard what the website might otherwise indicate. The acoustics are what one might expect since this is not an amphitheater. They endeavor to discourage parking on the neighborhood streets. But from what we could see, south of Sunset there are many streets where one could park without causing any undue difficulties anyone. Otherwise you might have to pay between $15 and $25 to park near the cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc

Judy Garland, Toto, Mickey Rooney, Dee Dee Ramone, Johnny Ramone has a memorial but is NOT buried there. He was cremated. Chris Cornell is buried right next to the Johnny Ramone statue. You can also find Carl Switzer (Alfalfa). The second time I went, an episode of the first season of Goliath was being filmed right in the middle of the grounds. Nice place to visit, as you're driving out the Hollywood sign is staring you right in the face.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/20anad15
50,Quirky Cemetery,"Way more fun that the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and less busy. Highlights include: The gangs of feral cats that roam the cemetery. The peacock enclosure with posturing males and skittish females. A modest monument to the dog that played Toto in the Wizard of Oz. Loads of other celebrity tombstones. Worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/naturetack
50,My future home!,I like this place so much I bought a cremation niche Roth next to actress Ann Sheridan and on the other side of her is the niche of the lady who created and wrote all of the I Love Lucy shows.Judy Garland and Micky Rooney are also there.Not the best part of town but very peaceful.Its also right next to Paramount Studios and both places give guided tours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maewest93

50,HUGE Cemetery ... go there only if you have time,"WOW ... huge place, lots of walking. Look up the stars and their locations before you go. Well kept cemetery but they are not fond of fans trudging through for photos so visit and photograph discretely and please ... be respectful. Many, many beautiful stones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mburbank2016

50,Awesome and Sad at Same Time,"We were able to tour the Hollywood Forever Cemetery as part of a tour of the Paramount Studios. This was a fun way to see the burial and memorial sites of some of film, music, and other entertainment greats. It was sad as well as some of these stories are tragic in nature. I would recommend taking a tour of the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidFrmTexas
30,"OK, but don't expect celebs","If in the area worth a drive through. There are some large memorials here, but in case you're expecting celebs to pay respect to you'll be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zenzar123
50,Fantastic cemetry,A great location if you just want somewhere to chill in Hollywood or are interested in those stars who have passed away.Me and my husband visited in May 2017 as part of our honeymoon trip following our marriage and was one of the best places we visited. As a huge Judy Garland fan my main reason for visiting was to visit her resting place since she was moved from NY but the rest of the grounds was very interesting.Of course this is a cemetery and it must be hugely respected but after visiting other cemeteries in Hollywood I felt that HF really did make tourists feel welcome. A must visit for any Hollywood fan.P.S we recently had a trip to Minneapolis and picked up a great documentary on dvd there on the cemetery called The Young and the Dead which is a great watch. It’s a dated documentary but still very interesting!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevetheVegan
40,Lovely grounds,"My wife wanted to visit and I was pleasantly surprised. The grounds are lovely and well manicured, it’s also interesting to see the graves of some of the great Hollywood stars. Johnny Ramones grave is a standout,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redgenz
40,Beautiful Grounds - doesn't feel like you're in the heart of LA!,"Hollywood Forever Cemetery is a wonderful place to spend an hour or two. It's centrally located to other Hollywood attractions so when you're over the crowds of people at The Walk of Fame, venture over for some peace and quiet in a naturally beautiful setting. There's tons of grass and trees and a nice sized lake with turtles, koi, ducks, swans, etc. There's even peacocks that roam the grounds and have a pen to the left of the entrance. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that I thought it would be more ""famous"" people. There was only a handful of graves from people I was familiar with. Next time, I won't be so cheap and I'll pay the $5 for map that shows were all the famous people are!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1037HIstevem
50,Great place to do a nice walk.,This is a very famous park with a lot of celebrities that are interred there. I find it very beautiful just to walk around the lake and see the wonderful wildlife that live there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnbN4283YO
50,Really interesting,"It’s always fascinating to wonder this graveyard. Famous graves all over the place. You can drive in, get a map at the small florist ($5) just near the main entrance gate. Be careful driving, lots of wildlife call the cemetery home, like peacocks, swans, ducks, squirrels and a lot of cats. Show respect, this is very much a working, active cemetery, still accepting new arrivals, so you may actually end up near a funeral. This is also a bit of an oasis protected from all the LA craziness surrounding it’s high walls, the serenity is a very welcome change and worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookinoutallover
50,Kari Bible = Historian and Terrific Tour Guide,"I took Kari's Tour Wed. April 25, 2018. I just happened upon the tour. I knew nothing about it or Kari. It was wonderful to discover just how effective Kari's tour is. She has a vast amount of knowledge and she uses visual aids as well - photos, posters, production shots, etc. - to convey to the group the person she is describing. My handicap in the various graveyards is just finding the graves - that's why I do these tours. Kari brings a breadth of knowledge and a very polished and professional air to the proceedings and all for only $20! Cheap at twice the price!. The tour is comprehensive and there is a lot to discover - plan for two hours + ! After the tour, while poking around for anything that might be online regarding Kari Bible, I made another discovery...Arthur Dark and his Hollywood Graveyard Tours on YouTube! They are a great accompaniment to Kari's",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgtravers
50,great cemetery!,"let me start by saying I LOVE cemeteries, and this is definitely one of the best. beautifully maintained, the place reeks of Hollywood history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnRyan724
40,Scenic & interesting cemetery,"I called into the cemetery after completing the Paramount studios tour (which is located next tour). I would say the cemetery is well worth a visit if you're doing the Paramount tour, I'm not sure it would be worth the effort of travelling from elsewhere only for the cemetery.Make sure you enter from the north entrance (on Santa Monica Boulevard) so you can pick up a map of the cemetery ($5) from the flower shop just inside the gate. You really wouldn't be able to find any of the notable graves without a map.You won't need more than an hour to go round, although could take it at a leisurely pace and stay for a bit longer as it is a pleasant park to be in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephensH3674DY

50,Great in the summer where they show movies on the mausoleums!,"From Charlie Chaplin to just about anyone who was anyone in the early LA film era, this iconic resting place of the greats is a wonderful place to take a stoll if you happen to be in the area.Make it a point to be here in the summer where they show vintage movies outdoors on one of the buildings! BYOF",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashebroe
40,Sombre but a nice quite place to walk,"If you're into this sort of thing, the grounds of this cemetary are lovely and it's a nice walk. There are a few celebrities here but it depends on your age. The Ramones, Don Adams, Judy Garland are a few of the standouts. When you enter the facility they sell maps for $5. Have a read through the names first. It lists about 100 celebrity graves but to be honest, I only knew about 5 of the names so I guess you would need to be a music or film fan to appreciate it more.Also remember it is an active cemetary so there are funerals in place along with family members visiting departed loved ones so it's not the place for a soda and screeming kids.Of particular into, Toto has a memorial here after his original burial site was desecrated to make way for a freeway. Now that's LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAK2123
50,"Check this place out, it's worth a look see.","I am so happy this cemetery was taken over by the Cassity's. I don't care how they got there money to do it but it was completely fixed up and memorials put up. Now the stars have a place to call home after they pass on. Make sure you visit Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. There is a really great guidebook for sale at the flower shop just to your right as you enter. It helps you find the graves. They do film movies here, this week was a Disney pilot thought they couldn't tell us the name.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baxterthetravelguy
50,Not a Typical Cemetery!,"Hollywood Forever is unlike most Ca. cemeteries, I'd say its more like New Orleans, filled with huge Mausoleums and amazing funeral art. It also is the final resting place for many of Hollywood and the Music industries stars. They have Monthly events, tours and even films , buy a ticket bring a blanket and sit on the lawn with everyone. OR come for the annual Day of the Dead festival . One of the most colorful events in LA! They have a website with all the info and prices. You will be amazed at who ""resides"" here ...Valentino to Punk rockers and even a tribute to Toto the dog from Oz!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smsdes
40,Celebrities living/floating here! Immaculate and the Yelchin's! Visit!,"Otis (of Otis/Chandler) is buried here along with his wife. Parking is Free and the mausoleum closes at 2:00 p.m. Nice to meet the Yelchin family--St. Petersburg--who were celebrating their son's (Anton) life. Ramone statue looked wonderful.Red/white roses decorated Anton's grave and, on this day, blue skies were filled with cumulonimbus clouds, while geese cackled and visitors wondered who the striking couple was by the lake and what were all the roses and heart balloons for?Anna was cordial (floral shop) offering tropical flowers and ten-dollar directory to this venue. Cemetery was immaculate and areas were clean and gravestones well kept. Notice the Fairbanks lawn and the many lessons that were silent and architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/170indiac
50,Wow,"From the outside it looked like a small chapel. As you walked closer you realized it is a cemetery. As you go in, you realized its not a normal cemetery from the names stated on the grave stone.An opportunity to pay respect to some of these people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanara
50,This place is awesome.,Came to drive thru and see the place and the Masonic Lodge building. Stayed for 3 hours to get out and see the history. Don't miss this on your trip to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224douglasr
50,Pleasant Surprise,"I can’t believe how much I enjoyed HFC. It was so much more than I expected!The cemetery is absolutely beautiful and the landscaping is exceptional. You can see the Hollywood Sign and the Griffith Observatory as you walk through the cemetery. The only noise we heard was birds singing. There were even peacocks roaming the grounds. A very relaxing experience.Most of the celebrities are buried near the lake. Some have simple markers and others have monuments. Finding them was fun and brought back many memories. The lake is really beautiful. There’s swans, geese, and ducks swimming around the mausoleum in the middle of the lake.There is a flower shop as you enter the cemetery that sells maps and gift books. We had bought the HFC gift book which had a Cemetery map that helped us find the celebrities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetHanover

50,What a way to go!,"Hollywood Forever is home to the final resting places of several Hollywood luminaries, from Toto, the dog in Wizard fo Oz, to movie legend Mickey Rooney. Equally fascinating are the elaborate tombstones of numerous Russian and Armenian resting places, complete with photographs. The grounds are beautiful and it's easily walkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/931stevek

50,Do the walking tour with Kari Bible,"Such a deal at $20 to have Kari take you around the cemetery, pointing out the legendary figures in cinematic and TV history. It is a fascinating place and to have someone like Kari who guides you through in such a tasteful and respectful way is well worth it. As I went in November the weather was reasonable but if you go in summer, defintely wear a hat, have plenty of water etc. (usual CA recommendations) because there isn't much in the way of shade.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELMG
50,Fascinating Cemetery & Movie Experience,"Hollywood Forever Cemetery is one of the most interesting & fascinating cemeteries I've visited and I've seen a lot of cemeteries across the country. Not only does it contain a lot of famous people resting place like Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney, Anton Yelchin, Darren McGavin, Don Adams & etc. It has a beautiful pond and has many interesting headstones & statues.What this cemetery offers that none other do that I know of is they have movie nights during the summer months on the weekends where they show old movies. There is a charge to attend these movies (about $15 plus service charges & a parking fee if you park inside the cemetery). This is the second time we've attended a movie and each time we thought it was a great experience. They show the movie against one of the large mausoleum walls and it feels like you are at a drive-in but don't sit in your car. I would recommend taking your own snacks but there are some concession stands but they are a little expensive and don't offer the variety that a movie theatre does. Also, you should take a blanket to sit on and at night there it can get chilly even in the summer time so you might want to take a light jacket and blanket to use as a cover to keep warm.Visiting this cemetery will make a nice memory especially if you attend one of their movie nights. I would recommend buying your tickets once you know you want to see a specific movie there because they do sell-out at times and buy the parking pass at the same time because it fills up.We didn't take a guided tour of this cemetery but the next time we visit we will. I know of at least one women who provides tours but you need to reserve a spot and she only does it on certain days (I think Saturdays) because we went to the office toward the front of the cemetery and they had a brochure for the tour. A guided tour of this cemetery would be very interesting. The office does sell a map of where celebrities are buried, post cards and it may sell some other small items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,Awesome cemetery!,"I tend to visit cemeteries when I'm traveling, particularly when famous people are buried there. I have actually been to Hollywood Forever twice before for concerts, including Lana Del Rey... but this time I was here to see Chris Cornell. Not in concert, unfortunately. He's right next to Johnny Ramone, with a simple grave but a fantastic location! The graves here are the best of any cemetery I have seen outside of Ireland... definitely a great place to hang out for awhile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DarkSolstice
50,Great walkabout,Enjoyed walking around the well landscaped and maintained grounds of this historic and awesome graveyard. The staff was very friendly and informative By The Way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C530WSdavel
30,"Old Hollywood, Dead or Alive...well, mostly Dead","Hollywood Memorial (as I still call it) is home stomping grounds...two of my grandparents and two of my great-grandparents are buried here. In the Seventies we used to climb over the wall and enjoy this place at midnight. Since then it's been purchased by a family eager to market its fame, so there are movies projected against the sides of a mausoleum, concerts and a famous Day of the Dead/Halloween party here.If you are interested in silent film history, many of those people are here, as well as some pioneers of old Los Angeles, although most of those folks are in Evergreen, Rosedale or Calvary. The oldest part of the cemetery is along the east wall; the ""Hollywood"" section is near this side. If you are looking for somebody specific, go on Findagrave and look for photos of the site; the usual cemetery numbers are not there.The people on the grounds can be helpful, but the people at the front desk can be exceptionally rude; I had one working on e-mail and basically ignoring me, because she thought I was a tourist. Even when you get directions, as I said, this cemetery is not as well marked as some, and most of the numbers you would find on the curbs are worn off by all the traffic from movie screenings and parties they hold here. If you are just looking for an interesting cemetery, try Inglewood, Evergreen, Calvary or Rosedale; there are specific events at this cemetery if you want to check it out. Be aware that the mausoleums are locked up early, sometimes much earlier than the signs say.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsmog
40,ODD PLACE TO SPEND TIME,This is an odd place to spend time but the grounds are lovely and the day was beautiful. Just walking around looking at some of the older graves of many famous people was very interesting.. It is still an active cemetery but not so busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vintagechina
40,Dia de Los Muertos a must!,"It only happens once a year, but I would highly recommend a save the date for this event. Dia de Los Muertos is an annual event held at Hollywood Forever and costs $20 a person. Our party of 6 spent the evening there and I can’t think of a better way to see the cemetery come to life. Alters are created by the families and the bigger the better. There are about three stages throughout the cemetery which have music, cultural dances, and more going on. Food vendor lines were long this year so we did not get to eat here but there are drink vendors and lots of day of the dead merchandise for sale. The event runs from 12pm to 12am so there’s lots of time to see everything. I would highly recommend staying through the evening as most of the alters light up in some way. Also, it’s a great place to take pictures with people dressed up for the celebration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,Serene place with no entrance fee or parking fee,"It's a cheap and relaxing way to spend an hour or two. If you're in your 20's, you probably wont know any of the famous celebrities buried here though. It's good exercise if you feel like walking so wear sensible shoes that you don't mind getting dirty. If you don't wanna walk you can always take your car to move between mausoleums. Google the cemetery map so you dont wander aimlessly. Wear sunscreen because there are only a few shaded areas",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa51910
40,Very Peaceful,"Although The Hollywood Forever Cemetery has become a tourist attraction, I’m pleased to say that this is somewhere that you can come and pay your respects to some of those that have brought so much to the world that we live in.As you would expect, there are some very elaborate headstone and memorial, but is a cemetery in every respect.Thankfully it’s not swamped by tourist and all those that visit are very respectful of the surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJA_7
40,A Summary of the Hollywood Movie Industry all in one Place,"It sounds a little macabre to be visiting a cemetery but in this place you discover a fascinating insight into the lives and beliefs of the stars who are interred here and the working of the Hollywood business. It is very well kept and peaceful.visiting the various resting places you are struck by the variety of monuments, some huge and sometimes overdone (Fairbanks) and others quite modest (Jane Mansfield and Rudolf Valentino. The one overriding fact that is evident by the sheer grandeur of their monuments is that the people funding the movies were the ones who made all the money in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaely416

Right behind Paramount Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/230jerryj

50,Ghosts of Hollywood Past,"What a beautiful cemetery. Gardens, pathways and ponds. A beautiful place to stroll and get lost in Hollywood Past. Area has beautiful Peacocks, ducks, swans and cats. There is areas for sitting and resting and taking in the beauty of the gardens and flowers. A good view of the Hollywood Sign overlooking the Cemetery can bee seen. Many of the Hollywood Elite are buried there. Must see if you like History and Movies. The Cemetery has movie nights that you watch under the stars for families too. Nice place and recommended for those who love to walk and have some quiet time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6422016
40,Peaceful and fresh break from the city,Refreshing greenery. Impressive monuments. Touching dedications. An interesting different perspective on the wealth and fame of Hollywood. Very glad I stopped by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helenam572
50,A MUST VISIT!!,We visited this cemetery for the first time and it was AMAZING!!! On Saturday nights in the summer they play old movies outdoors. There is a tour at 10 am (which we missed) but we did buy a book and did a self-guided tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamPack1965
50,So peaceful,"Considering LA is so busy and noisy, I was pleasantly surprised by how calm and peaceful this cemetery is. The grounds are beautifully kept. Well worth a visit if you want a break from tourist filled streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenBezzo

50,Fun walk,We walked without a map. Get a map. Amazing place. Great head stones. So many with pictures on it. Find Pete he is the best. I attached a pic of him. I think walking around without a map makes it even better. I would just stumble upon things. Such great old & new Hollywood history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/choz06
40,Different,"It feels odd to review a cemetery as an attraction, but here we go....I visited as a last minute addition to my itinerary, mostly to fill in time on my first day in LA. The grounds are beautiful, with well manicured lawns, beautiful flowers, well maintained monuments, and the sound of peacocks in the air. The birds are available for viewing just to the left of the entrance, a pleasant surprise. The Gardens of Legends is the best place to stroll, as it is stunningly beautiful, and the place with the most recognizable names, including Mickey Rooney, Fay Wray, Hattie McDaniels, Anton Yelchin, Toto, Cecil B. Demille, and more. It's slightly surreal that the entire cemetery is in the shadow of Paramount Studios, and the Studios pumps out loud music that can be heard from almost anywhere in the cemetery. Maps are available for 5 dollars, and make a cheap (by LA standards) souvenir that will help you make the most of your time in the cemetery. If you have any interest in this kind of thing, or are nostalgic for old Hollywood, you should definitely check this place out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationerGuy
40,Just remember it is a Cemetery,"Had some time to spare, so dropped into this cemetery, there are amazing people buried here and really interesting to see their final resting place. It is easy to forget that this is a very emotional place for those whose loved ones are there. I turned a corner with my camera around my neck to find a mother sitting by the fresh grave of her son, I quietly walked away but was a healthy reminder of where I was and that respect needed to be paid.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lookinoutallover

40,Paying respects to Hollywood Stars of yesteryear,"Of the three major Hollywood cemeteries, Hollywood Forever is probably the easiest to get to. And to its credit, it is actually located in Hollywood.At 6000 Santa Monica Boulevard, near N Gower, you could walk down from Hollywood Boulevard or hop on the 4/704 Metro Bus which runs along Santa Monica Boulevard.Reasonable in size, the cemetery is well maintained and easy to navigate (you can even drive through it).You can stop at the flower/gift shop at the gates and purchase a map to locate the famous or work your own way around.The cemetery is a wonderful mix of the famous, wanted to be famous and the unknown. Many are located in areas defining their backgrounds - it's interesting how we segregate our dead.Be sure to visit the large Mausoleum at the far left of the entrance near the lake. Inside you will find the final resting place of one of the site's most famous icons - the legendary silent movie star, Rudolph Valentino.Along the way you can visit Cecil B DeMille, and even some newer Hollywood stars such as the simple grave for Anton Yelchin (Star Trek) who passed away in 2016.Also be sure to walk through the beautifully lit mausoleums on the right side, which will delight any photographer.Well worth a visit. Please be respectful and quiet. Enjoy. Contemplate.The cemetery is open during the day almost every day of the year and is free to visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920vitom

50,A walk down memory lane.,"As we had been to Los Angeles a few times we looked for something different to do. We found Holywood forever cemetery at the end of a brisk walk from Holywood boulevard. It was so peaceful compared to the rest of the city and well looked after. We found peacocks strolling around amongst the graves. Star gravestones like Mel Blanc, Douglas Fairbanks senior, Cecil b. De Mille and his wife just a few. Not your usual tourist destination but for our generation which grew upon the old Holywood films a treat. In a city of ""money, money, money"" this was a free outing, no tips required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathM65
50,Away from the hustle and bustle,Wanted to come here to pay my respects to stars that have left us. Beautiful place which is well kept. Lovely place to visit and stroll along and see who now resides here.Pop into small flower shop and purchase a map and gift book as gives names and places of people in the cemetery.Not a morbid or sad place but a beautiful place to pay your respects.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traceybrownsword1971

The care talkers were very helpful with telling us about the history of tge place and who is buried hete. A must do if you want to do something diffetent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carleneri
40,Time to Reflect,"The Forever cemetery is a beautifully maintained garden setting. It's peaceful, tranquil and entry is free. If your a flim buff you will love roaming around the grounds and spotting the graves of the old time favourites. Lyrebirds can be seen and heard walking around in the gardens and swans swimming in the lake. Give yourself about 2 hours to simply soak up the atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/norma_gordon
40,Beautiful,This cemetary is a quite and peaceful right in the middle of a crazy busy city. You can see the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory from here. Some of the markers/head stones are works of art. I suggest the book about the cemetary and some of the famous buried here and for $11 it was worth it. The staff in the flower shop are very helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
50,Gorgeous,Gorgeous cemetery that is close to Paramount studios (they have their security walking the cemetery grounds). I came here early before a studio tour and it was opened well before the advertised time. Apparently they have maps to famous graves in the gift shop? I didn't know that until after and was just using the internet to help me. All the graves are accessible aside from Judy garland who was just moved there (it's closed off in the Jewish section and can only see through a window). Anton yelchin is probably the newest celebrity burial after Judy garland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brittanyzz
50,A Great Free LA Activity,"This cemetery if HUGE and there are a lot of stars to look for amid the tombs of the great and the good of Los Angeles. The Cemetery is in the shadow of the Paramount Pictures Studio Lot. You will need walking shoes, bottled water on a hot day and before you get here download a map showing you where to look for graves of the notables. You can buy a map at the flower/gift shop at the front gate. Bring your camera and when you get home you can read all about the neat people you got to ""meet"" at Hollywood forever. Look for the cemeteries newest star resident...Judy Garland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brodie52
50,Fascinating place to view famous graves,"I had an incredibly fun day walking around the cemetery when I first moved to Los Angeles, visiting some beautiful monuments to huge Hollywood stars, with a friend. Mel Blanc's is the most memorable. I was talking about it just the other day. Cinespia is a wonderful addition to the cemetery with their seasonal outdoor movies and music events on pleasant nights, though after a while parking issues made it so sometimes we blew off the movies, parking was so challenging. I hope they have figured out the parking by now. It's been quite a few years since I took a chance again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainesokoloff
50,A Hollywood Oasis,"I visit Hollywood Forever every time I am in Hollywood. It is a beautiful memorial park which helps transport you back into the Golden Age of Hollywood. One of the only cemetaries in the area where you really are welcome to pay your respects to your favourite entertainers. The resident cats and peacocks also add to the experience (watch the black cat that frequents Johnny Ramone's memorial, he is cheeky!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nym0usC0ntribut0r

40,Fascinating,"I'm a big fan of the Ramones so as so this was top of the list of things to do in LA for me. We looked up the location of Johnny and Dee Dee's graves online beforehand, and they were very easy to find. Really cool place, and not too far a walk from Hollywood blvd either.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrsjnkns
40,Not to everyone's taste...,"...but I found it fascinating! This cemetery gives an interesting insight into early Hollywood residents. It also tells a story of how those, with far to much money, desire to be remembered. Micky Rourke, Johnny Ramone, Don Adams, Toto - if you're looking to see a famous grave, this cemetery is full of them. To avoid wandering the huge site aimlessly, buy a map/list from the souvenir shop on your way in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyH247

Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes, a full water bottle and sun hat.There are tons of photo ops and Johnny Ramone seems to always have a crowd.I recommend Hollywood Forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madisons709
50,Amazing history of the cemetery and some of the graves,"I visited the cemetery as part of a guided tour and the commentary was amazing. If you visit on your own, do some prior research. For instance, there is a dog on Alfalfa's grave and I read that it was supposed to be Petey, the dog. But it doesn't look like Petey at all. Our guide told us a reason why a dog is on the grave and it was a great story. As was the Hattie McDaniel story, and many others. There are many famous people buried here and it's fascinating for someone my age (68). It's a lot of area to walk but it's level and worth the time. Not the most beautiful cemetery but the lake area is pleasant with swans. Read about the history of the cemetery and its former owner Jules Roth. His life would make quite a movie. I'd love to go back to see more. You can see the Hollywood sign from the cemetery. I enjoyed it very much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GardaGal0912
10,Hollywood Forever Appropriation of Culture,The Hollywood Forever Cemetery Dia de Los Muertos Celebration is but yet another appropriation of Mexican-Indigenous Culture complete with a total disregard of what this holy day signifies for the real veneration of ancestors. Their three stage (ring circus) is yet another example of how clueless people become when their main motivation is dollars. Sad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasGitana
40,Do some research before you go,"We love visiting old cemeteries so we knew we had to visit this one. The view of the Hollywood sign from here is pretty amazing. The grounds are well maintained and tall palm trees are beautiful. It is very peaceful with water fountains all around.It is free to drive into the cemetery and park. You can go into the little flower shop at the entrance where they DO have maps, but the maps are $5. That's why I say you should do some research before you go!You can find info online about how to navigate the cemetery to find the graves that you are looking for. Trust me...we kept going in circles and getting lost. It is HUGE once you get in there.I was happy that we found the one memorial I was most interested in - Toto from the Wizard of Oz. Our course, there are several other famous people in there, but I really love Toto. Pics are attached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
40,Resting place of the stars,A little planning makes this a much better experience. It's a big place with a lot of different areas to explore.

50,Johnny and Dee Dee Ramone,I am a huge Ramones fan so visiting the Hollywood Forever Cemetery was definitely on our agenda.

A must for anyone who loves the Ramones.It's easy to find and a free attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragiansanti34
30,OK Place to Go,"Jonny Ramone, Rudolph Valentino, Mel Brooks and Douglas Fairbanks are a few of the famous buried here.

With the amount of celebrity's buried there you could take hours and hours to walk around. However I used my phone to navigate to various people I wanted to find.

50,A wonderful place for fans to pay their respect,"The cemetery visit is free, but I bought a $5 map because the cemetery is very large, and it's easy to get lost. Most of the graves and crypts of the stars are in the back left corner. It's sad that some of the most notable stars, especially of early Hollywood, have very small markers and bushes grown up around them, such as Janet Gaynor's. Valentino's crypt is highly visited and had lipstick kisses on it. Crazy. Sadly, Hattie McDaniel has a memorial, but no grave, as African-American artists weren't buried there back in the day. Cecil B. DeMille's gravesite has a huge marble marker, epic in death as he was in life. Mostly, I just wanted to remember them for all the hours of entertainment they had given.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriP920
30,Not sure what to say,Well it's a huge cemetery and I went because I had done the dearly departed tour to the Westwood village. Well it's a $5 charge for a map of the stars final resting place. I only knew a few of the famous names. I paid my respects and left. My suggestion is if you're going to go to the cemetery go when they show the movies at night.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J9260DPjamiec

50,One of my favorite places in LA,History that is Hollywood Forever... it was the first Cemetery in LA ...there is quite unbelievably a monument to Confederate soldiers of the civil war right as you enter on your left. It sits directly behind Paramount Studios in fact the western wall is actually studio buildings. I go to visit my old friend Dee Dee Ramone who is at the opposite end of the Lake from Johnny Ramones statue Everyone from Alfalfa from the little Rascals who was murdered in his 30's Tyronne Powers Bugsy Segal Valentino Don Adams of get Smart fame Cecil B Demille and on and on...... Jane Mansfield is not one of them though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cadillacbluez
40,Interesting but Westwood Village Cemetery easier to navigate,"We came here to see celebrity graves and although they do have many, finding them can be difficult at times, even with the $5 map you can buy at the flower shop at the main entrance. Toto, Valentino, Mel Blanc, Mickey Rooney, Fay Wray, Jayne Mansfield, Cecil DeMille, and several others -- mostly older stars.The Hollywood Westwood Village Cemetery was smaller and much easier to navigate with numerous stars including Marilyn Monroe, Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, both female children from Poltergeist movies, Farrah Fawcett, and many more. I'd recommend this one first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741

20,"Neat graveyard, rude security","A friend of mine and I visited the cemetery back in March and were very excited to explore. We were taking some photos of the area and were approached by a security guard who asked us to only take photos of the celebrity graves as to not disrespect the privacy of the families. It was kind of an odd request as that has never been the case in Canada, or at least where we live, but of course we were not going to disrespect their rules. Nevertheless, we continued to take photos of the celebrity graves. We asked a security guard, apparently from Paramount (the lot is nearby), if it was alright to take photos with some of the graves – some of them are really neat, like that of Johnny Ramone. He said that was perfectly fine as long as we didn’t climb all over them, which clearly makes perfect sense. We thanked him for his time and continued on. A bit later on, we were taking some more pictures of the celebrity graves and were approached by the same security guard again who asked us for a second time not to take pictures of the graves of people who were not famous. We told him we weren’t and showed him the grave on a map of the celebrity graves on my friend’s phone (we didn't want to pay for the piece of paper at the office), then chatted with him for a little while before he moved on. Fast forward twenty minutes and we’re at Fay Wray’s grave taking some photos. My friend is snapping a couple pictures of me with it (I’m a fan) and a different security guard approaches us and tells that the other guard had informed us not to take photos with the graves and we needed to stop. At this point, we were very confused and told him that no one had told us we weren’t allowed to take photos with it and there must be some confusion. We mentioned the Paramount guard and he flatly told us that the people from Paramount had no authority over the cemetery. I should also mention that he had NO IDEA who Fay Wray was and accused us of taking photos with random graves again. We apologized for the misunderstanding and asked if he wanted us to delete the photos, to which he said it was alright and we could keep them. Apparently because we were wearing makeup they didn’t want us taking pictures with ourselves in the photos because it looked like a photoshoot. If that wasn’t the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard… he said it WOULD have been okay if we weren’t made up. Um? I will admit I was wearing a Disneyland Haunted Mansion sweater and purple lipstick (to match the sweater) and my friend was very made up (the way he always is) – but we were far from having a photoshoot. He did say he felt a lot better about it after talking with us, and we think they may have mixed us up with a couple they had been speaking to earlier who looked like they were doing a little photoshoot, but still – it kind of dampened the mood. So be diligent while taking photos. They have some strict (and ridiculous) rules. We later had a much better experience at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery while on the Dearly Departed Tour. Security was much friendlier and a lot less uptight.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/supermanatee

I have paid respects to Evita, Rin Tin Tin, the G.l's at Normandy, and the unknown in Leningrad.The Hollywood Forever was way up there. Of course, starting with Hollywoood and movies, the tour has a great advantage, and it lives up to the promise.A good balance of the history of Hollywood itself, the unique cemetery, and the people buried there. From the greats like Valentino to the lesser known (or almost unknown like Virginia Rappe), the guide's sensitivity and respect for the people came through.The cemetery is very interesting, but the Hollywood Forever Cemetery Tour, may I say, ""brings it to life.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn408

Excellent tour and a clean tidy and beautiful resting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JW999UK

40,Interesting to see,"We obtained a map from the gift shop (yes, there is a gift shop in this cemetery) and proceeded to walk through to see the many different tomb stones of the rich and famous. It was very cool. However, when I took a picture, security came over to me and told me that photos were not allowed and if I didn't put my camera away I would have 7 attorneys after me. This struck me as odd since there are so many pictures of these famous graves on line. I liked the peacocks, cats and swans, but the incident with security left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/995tjs
40,A Beautiful Park,"The cemetery is a beautiful place to spend a morning or afternoon. Maps to stars' graves can be downloaded. I'd read they could be obtained at the front offices, but as we went on a Sunday afternoon there were multiple funerals taking place and we didn't feel comfortable barging into the office to demand a map. Even with funerals ongoing, the staff simply blocked off the areas for mourners and positioned guards to ensure families' privacy, but plenty of tourists were respectfully wandering the grounds. The mausoleums are bright and sunny. Some of the older stars are difficult to find; certain areas of the cemetery are rather crowded and poorly maintained. I'd been here before for Cinespia events (also fantastic), but had never had time to explore the entire space. Overall it was beautiful, with gorgeous views of the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992elizabetht

40,A Peaceful Place In The Heart of Hollywood,"although i've been to Los Angeles many times, my first visit to Hollywood Forever didn't occur until recently. it's 64 acres of lush greenery, and serves as the final resting place for many stars of yesteryear. they also hold film screenings and concerts from time to time. the area of Santa Monica Blvd where it's located is a little run down, but seems safe enough as i saw families and young professionals going about their daily routines (the cemetery is open during normal business hours, so this is best for a daytime activity). best advice is to go when the weather is a little cooler: i was in L.A. during the late-September heat wave, so i only stayed on the grounds for a short amount of time as temperatures were in the 90's. parking is free (if you tell the staff you're visiting the grounds, they'll tell you where to park), and there is a public restroom. bring a camera, bottled water, and good walking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phanteana
50,A Unique Spot for a Cinematic Experience,"My first time here was for a screening of Blade Runner at night. It was an amazing experience walking through this historic spot to view one of my favorite pieces of cinema.Seeing these magnificent tombs and tombstone, the lush landscape and beauty of the grounds is quite breathtaking. Considering this is a resting place for the dead, I wouldn't be so glum about death if this was where I was to go :).Unfortunately I have only been there once, for the movie and was not able to enjoy the grounds during the day but that time will come soon. Maybe during the Thanksgiving weekend?With so many typical touristy things to do around LA, why not do something a little different and take a tour of this piece of history.Happy Traveling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danzaviva
30,"Interesting, But The Grounds Need Some TLC",Many famous stars and other film dignitaries are interred here and we were intrigued by some of the unique headstones and epitaphs. But the grounds were unkept and in need of a maintenance overhaul. Still worth a look but don't expect Forest Lawn.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyFromAtlanta_GA
50,"Beautiful, unique, somber, imaginative, and more! A fantastic day trip!","Make sure you wear some good walking shoes and be prepared to be amazed! To walk in the place where famous people have been laid to rest is quite the experience, and to be able to see all the unique headstones of ""not so famous"" people is just as exciting! Walking through the cemetery and seeing the of the headstones of the dearly departed allows your imagination to work overtime. You will see a man sitting in a chair, or the face of the loved one who had passed, a unique sculpture, the statue of someone, a bench with a view of the pond, or even the pyramid that is not yet occupied. There is just so much to see. If you take the time to walk the cemetery, there is even older plots along the back wall of the cemetery, which is also the back wall of Paramount Studios. Take the time to read some of the headstones. Take time to sit at the Holocaust Memorial or at the Anne Frank Memorial and say a prayer for all the lives that were lost during the Holocaust. It was a wonderful experience to see the final resting places of Rudolph Valentino, Bugsy Siegel, Iron Eyes Cody and so many more. This is definitely a place where you will want to spend a good deal of time. The cemetery is full of history. Your first stop should definitely be at the Flower/Gift shop as the lady who works there is very well informed about the cemetery and can give you great insight into who is buried there and where. I would suggest at at least 3-4 hours to walk through the cemetery and remember to bring your camera! You never know what you will be able to photograph there, including the beautiful peacocks that roam the grounds and the coi fish in the pond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottesl
20,"Glad we visited but disappointing, not well kept","Have always wanted to visit the celebrity cemeteries of LA.Prior to our weeks trip to the city I did all the research, downloaded the guides from the seeing-stars website (invaluable)We were however somewhat shocked and disappointed by the neglected grounds. Most of the graves are semi covered with grass. -Forest lawn with it's acres of grounds ensure that each and every grave stone is manicured. (we visited both Forest Lawns and Westwood so could compare fairly)A perfect example of this is the Fairbanks tomb, this should be beautifully trimmed lawns and clean waters as it deserves instead of murky green water and overgrown grass- such a shame. There must have been so much money invested initially laying these Hollywood Greats to rest -glad they can't see it now.So whilst it was great to finally 'meet' the celebrities (and there are lots) this cemetery sadly seems currently not to be worthy custodians. This together with a very busy feel (cars, staff) seemed to us like a lack of respect. Visit the beautiful, tranquil Forest Lawn, Glendale and you will understand our comparison.Even now a week later writing this I'm still very saddened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fordwater
40,One of the best places to see movies!,Last movie I saw at the cemetery was Willy Wonka back in July but every time I've been here it's been a great experience. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 just because parking is always a little tricky if you’re going to a Cinespia screening even though it’s probably not an issue if you go during the day when (I think) you can just drive on. If you want to hear some great stories about the cemetery and its “inhabitants” definitely check out Paramount’s new After Dark tour “Tales from the Other Side”!!! A little pricey but my husband and I loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassandra816

You can spend hours walking around and seeing all the beautiful tributes to the stars.

There is a lake, swans, and beautiful mausoleums to walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/9Buffalolady20
40,Celebrity Heaven,"Very interesting cemetery, with a lot of celebrities buried here. It is just adjacent (along its rear boundary) to the old Paramount Pictures studio lot. An interesting grave to visit is that of Nelson Riddle, the musical legend who wrote (among other tunes) the old ""Route 66"" theme. The theme plays continuously at the grave.

I knew I must go here to check it out!For me, it was a museum of Hollywood Icons & a very well kept and peaceful location.The young entrepeneurs, who purchased this land and cemetery, were brilliant & acquired it at an amazingly low price!KUDOS to them! They've done a wonderful job of changing the dismal aura of an abandoned, unkempt cemetery, into an adventure to find famous Hollywood Icons; special events in celebration of those forever there, and tours, which save loads of time if you're on a short visit.I don't know if they have any plots left, after their television exposure; and it's been years.They sold me on the video they'll make for any client to leave for the ones you loved; ""Before you go...or are totally out of it...It happens!"" Get a Grip!I'm only in my 60's; and after dealing with my parents' estates recently; I've learned! So I'm getting all my details in Order now!Hope I can get a spot there. I don't need anything elaborate. Just really felt the AURA OF THE PLACE; which was a very good one! Happy place to be in the hereafter; with happy visitors and happy gatherings all around!Guess I'll cross this off my list and go Google it now...Bottom line: a don't miss! Not sure about young children, unless their parents have explained the hereafter and whomever they believe the Higher Power is in their lives....As I said before, it's a Happy Place; Not Somber & Depressing...So in my opinion, kids would enjoy it as well, if their parents are in touch with their kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6

20,What a disappointment!,"We were in LA for a couple of days and decided to do the ""Stars' Cemeteries"" tours! We went to Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Pearce Brothers Westwood Village and Hollywood Forever. We saw lots of star's burial spots and have to say were very disappointed by Hollywood Forever. It was very poorly maintained, weeds and grass everywhere. Lots of stones that were leaning and it seemed there were no restrictions as to what kind of ""decorations"" could be put on graves or how long they could remain. Tacky plastic flowers, and other inappropriate things everywhere. Forest Lawn and Westwood Village were very well maintained and manicured. Hollywood Forever has added lots of mausoleum space for sale in very inappropriate places They did have a map showing the locations of notable burials for $5, which I thought was a little pricey for one piece of paper, but it did help find notable burials! Any sense of reverence or respect has given way to a commercial venture, complete with stage for evening concerts!!!!!!! The old part of the cemetery was very nice, but the addition of the tacky stones with photos and the crowded and tilted markers was a total turn off!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daphnejune

50,Unlikely concert venue,"Last Thursday our family of four was lucky enough to attend a Tame Impala concert at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. I would probably not have considered this as a venue, but the band was going to offer two shows there and we were able to get tickets for their Thursday show. We paid $20 to park on-site. Ticketfly sends a very long list of do's and don't's and I thought it would be a bit of a hassle. However, once we got there everything ran smoothly. Doors to park opened promptly at 6, as stated on the tickets. We parked next to the peacocks' cages, which I understand are allowed to roam around freely whenever there aren't any shows. This is an all ages venue, you are allowed to bring blankets, wine, foods, etc. The portable bathrooms are clean and are enough for the 3000 people that are allowed in. The cemetery has a very extravagant vibe, with huge tomb stones and mausoleums that light up at night. The concert goers could be more respectful and pick up the trash, smoke less maybe, but in general it seems like is a very good place to go visit. They even have movie nights during the summer i think. Overall, an interesting place to go visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandiegans
50,"Classic Hollywood Film Buffs, This is THE PLACE!","We went with friends, who said they used to lunch by Rudolph Valentino's bench. I wish I could've spent more time exploring, but the others weren't as interested in seeing the monuments to the dead. It is a very serene place. If you have time, check out the films they show on weekends, I think, but get there early to get a good seat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FabGlinda
30,Take the tour as by yourself is just okay,"Had a couple of hours to spare so we decided to visit the cemetary to do some (dead) star spotting. I think you can get a amp but we just aimlessly wandered about so we missed most of them. The cemetary is really big so I would recommend talking a guided tour or at least getting a map which I think you get from the florist at the front gate.Obviously Johnny Ramone is one that a lot of people go for but I liked stumbling upon the tribute to Toto, the dog from the Wizard of Oz who was actualy a girl called Terri not a boy dog!It's okay if you have a bit of time to kill but do your research otherwise you will be looking at lots of headstones of regular people, some very pretty but not really that interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peth99
50,Surprisingly spacious and serene,The Hollywood Forever cemetery is a famous last resting place for the stars and also a famous tourist destination. It is however surprisingly serene and spacious when you visit it and at the same time extravagant as could be expected from Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hermes_NL
50,Hollywood Forever Cemetry Walking Tour,"If you are a movie buff and like visiting a cemetry, a walking tour with Karie Bible, the current 'Lady in Black'. I organised a mid week tour with Karie before we left Australia, as we were not going to be there on the weekend when she normally conducts tours. Karie is a mind of information and has interesting stories to tell about 'old Hollywood'. Of course you could wander around by yourself if you want, but for a modest fee of $US15, you wont be disappointed. It drizzled the morning we were there, but it didn't dampen Karie's passion or enthusiasm and we enjoyed this tour as one of the highlights of are latest US trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RussCanberra
50,Beautiful Cemetary,"I enjoyed the beautiful grounds. The beautiful Rollsroyce Hearst parked in front the mausoleums were spooky in a Gothic kind of way. Very prominent families married there as well. As Hollywood royalty. The headstones are so interesting with quotes! Young and old , realty mogules. See how long ppl lived , the demographic ethnic of old Hollywood. We walked a solid hour and still didn't find everyone. We will be back again in fall when its not so humid. We saw graves with Tyrone Power, Haddie Mc Daniel, Mickey Rooney, Toto, Mel Blanc, The De Miel family, Jane Manfield, Robbie Ramone. Can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spfeismom
30,Good for a walk,"It is a nice walk around the grounds. Do not go out of your way to visit. It is incredible how much is spent on mausoleums, It is as if one family would try to outdo another. Many famous people are interned there. We only saw Mel Blanc. That;s All Folks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPL0626
50,Tour the Stars Last Resting Places,Hollywood Forever Cemetery is located directly behind Paramount Studios. You can obtain a map for a nominal fee when entering the grounds which I would highly recommend. Well kept grounds and numerous starts of yesteryear are buried here. They also show films periodically on the grounds which is very nice. Keep in mind this is a cemetery so act accordingly,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/h0wiek
40,Great way to spend a few hours!,If you like walking around cemeteries this is a great one. Lots of famous names to find and it is a really lovely place. Peacocks walking around and very well maintained (the cemetery not the peacocks). If you can grab a map it would be easier as its reasonably large. The majority of graves are within a close proximity but a few are away from them like Estelle Gettys and the Fairbanks. Definatey worth a visit if your interested in this type of thing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chappyschick
50,Alot of the actors/actresses from the Golden Age are here..,"I came to LA..for 2 reasons: see my relatives and do a bit of sightseeing..This has been on my bucket list for a long time..You can take the Metro to Hollywood Vine and take the DASh here..or take Bus 10..I came into the backway..Saw alot of Russian and Jewish graves before I got to the front of the cemetery and requested a bit of information..The Russian lady in the flower shop told me..that there are tours here,,but only on Saturday morning..I bought a map there for 5 bucks..Found out that the graves of the famous are numbered but it is still somewhat of a feat to find them..since graves in graveyards aren't usually numbered..But I did see Toto, Micky Rooney's, Hattie's, and Jayne Mansfield's graves..Really inspired by the Fairbanks' graves...they have their own patch of grassI also saw a few others..it is worth getting a little exercise, but bring your water..I liked the way..some graves have the picture of the deceased on the tombstone..have not seen that before..I was directed by some family members..to a couple of graves like the Talmadge sisters...I guess i might have looked lost!Being a female..I wanted to see Rudolph Valentino's grave..but the mausoleum where he was in was locked tighter than a drum..Don't know if it is ever opened..I have heard that Marylin Monroe is also here..but there was nothing on the map to indicate where she is..I also did a little exploring on the side..Found graves of people buried here since 1915 or so..After complete exhaustion, hunger, and thirst..I left the cemetery after walking 3 or more hours..it closes at 6pm..I was greeted by some .beautiful peacocks...the male even posed for me..I saw a little cage where they are kept..they must be someone's pets..Come here..and get a taste of Hollywood's past",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/840martae

50,A must do walk through Hollywood's past!,"If you love Hollywood and the stars that make it shine this is a must visit. From the cemetery you can look up and see the huge Hollywood sign in the hills, it is no wonder that stars want to be buried here! For $5.00 you can get a map of the grave sites from the little lady right next to the flower shop to the right when you enter the famous gates. Wander around and take a trip down memory lane with your favorite stars. Don't miss the epitaph to Toto from the Wizard of Oz!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasLori
30,not your normal attraction but quite interesting,"Large cemetery in Hollywood where some famous people are buried. We wandered the grounds respectfully. Saw Mel Blanc's grave (the voices of many characters in Looney Tunes cartoons) and Estelle Getty (""Golden Girls). You can see the Hollywood sign in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonT540
40,Unusual But Interesting - Worth A Trip,"I had seen this advertised in quite a few guide books as well as featured in some TV programmes and films so we decided why not. My partner and I parked up on Hollywood Boulevard just behind the Dolby Theatre and browsed round their sometime before making our way down.From here its just under 2 miles walk and takes only over a half an hour to walk although it took us slightly longer as we stopped off for a drink along the way. I would recommend walking down there as in a car you miss so much along the way. For instance we passed the Capitol records Building as well as production stages and took a detour onto Sunset Blvd.When arriving it is enormous but very peaceful and well maintained, a lovely place to stroll around. Interesting to see the iconic industry leaders, actors and writers buried here with Paramount Studios Water Tower just behind the complex. Some of the highlights were seeing Mel Blanc's - Toto Tribute - As well as Johnny Ramone ! Peacocks, Ducks and Swans are walking about - although i did have the misfortune of being chased by a swan - it is a good days trip and worth visiting if you have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVRW1011
40,Worth going!,"As the first cemetery in Hollywood, Hollywood Forever is both a historic landmark with many of Hollywood’s famous former stars and industry leaders, a tourist destination with roaming peacocks and ducks, beautifully maintained, and a location for outdoor films and musical entertainment in the evenings. It’s located on Santa Monica Boulevard and has free parking. The experience is both interesting but also a peaceful walk; this is after-all a cemetery, so being respectfully quiet though curious, seems to be the norm. Definitely recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72jackb
40,Easter Sunday visit.,"I visited the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on the afternoon of Easter Sunday 2015. I was doing a driving tour of the area during my last day in the Los Angeles area. I was mostly interested in seeing the Toto memorial. I drove in the entrance and parked on the side of the road shortly after I entered. I did not purchase any map, but had in my mind the area that I wanted to visit. That area was to the far left as you drove in to HFC. In my short time walking in the beautiful grounds I did see the Toto memorial, along with about 6 others that I could relate to. I am so glad I stopped, as it is quite beautiful and peaceful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia
50,Peaceful and beautiful,Drove thru and loved the beautiful scenery and foliage. Peacocks roamed around and didn't seem scared of people at all. We didn't pay for a map because you can look up the information online.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foogurl
40,An oasis of tranquility in Hollywood,"This is a beautiful place to visit for a respectful walk and escape from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. Obviously it is a cemetery, not a tourist attraction, and you cannot expect it to be full of celebrity graves as the vast amount are not, but I was still able to spot a few even with no map. Stop by to stroll the grounds, be respectful, check out the peacocks and enjoy the contrasting peace and quiet (and for free!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyRose333
40,Better for older folks?,"My boyfriend and I visited from Missouri. I love cemeteries, as I used to work at one, so I thought we would stop by. This is a beautiful cemetery with lots of West coast foliage. Photos only allowed of celebs' graves. You need a map to find the deceased celebrities which you can buy for a whopping $5 in the gift shop. We opted out, as you can find some information online. We only recognized a few celebs and feel that this is best for an older crowd to fully appreciate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steggie07
40,Nice!,"Considering where it is and the Hollywood mystique, I liked it!I didn't know about the Toto memorial. Mikey Rooney tomb was moving. Lots of Jewish plots and HUGE memorials! !!!!!!Peacocks all around. Free entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oneeddy1
40,Worth a visit.,"This place was suggested after the Paramount Studios Tour. It’s situated just behind Paramount. It’s not too big, but big enough, with peacocks roaming the grounds ! There is a memorial to Hattie McDaniel and one for Toto ! Celeb graves include Art Pepper, Jayne Mansfield, Mel Blanc, Mickey Rooney & Cecile B De Mille. They have maps available to find famous graves, costing $5.It’s worth a visit maybe once, though there were some hardcore Celeb grave hunters in there who had visited 15 times ! It is a working cemetery though, so respect is essential.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nodnoltravel
40,Beautiful but a little confusing,"The grounds are beautiful. Peacocks strolling about the property are beautiful. It's just too large to take in if you only want to be there an hour or two. Spend the $5 on the map, it does help but I still had trouble finding people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melb709
50,Hey Ho Let's Go ...,"Whilst my wife and I are huge Ramones fans and always visit the resting places of Johnny and Dee Dee, I would stress that the cemetry offers hot sunshine and cool stone, reverence and respect ... always a place for reflection and prayer, not a 'tourist attraction'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichS67
50,Beautiful cemetery full of cinematic history,"This is a beautiful cemetery that pays respectful homage to the dead. It's also the final home to many old Hollywood stars. As someone from the Midwest, I was expecting something a bit different, a bit more like the rural cemeteries of the Midwest and other areas of the country. But I should have known it would be it's own place. It's flat, filled with palm trees and located on land that used to be part of Paramount Studios. Hollywood Forever was on my bucket list. I've been there once and can't wait to get back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mindap2017
40,Peaceful,"We had a brief visit here on our trip to Los Angeles. The office was very helpful when I enquired about how to find a grave - was it a relative or a famous person? I was given a map and found my relatives with no problem. Beautifully kept grounds with tall palm trees. We were able to drive right in and up to the section where the graves were, the grass surrounds well kept. Unfortunately we did not have time to visit the graves of any of the stars, but it was wonderful finding my mother's uncle, wife, and their only child's graves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margo37
40,Another World,"We loved visiting here so much we could plan another trip. I was so touched to see the Hattie McDaniel and Toto memorials, just steps away from the Johnny Ramone memorial. It's a great location, just a few blocks from Paramount Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocor335
40,Nostalgic and scenic,"What a fascinating cemetery. There are plenty of famous people there, but equalling interesting are the headstones of the non-famous people, or the people who clearly wanted to be famous. This place is a reminder of when cemeteries were beautiful parks, not just a place for the dead. It is good for at least an hour's visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wwrrkd
40,A Nostalgic Visit to the Past Greats of Hollywood,"If you are interested in the history or familiar with the golden glamour days of Hollywood and some of the great actors, directors, etc., this place is worth a visit for a few hours. Two fascinating and scandalous women - Hearst's mistress - actress Marian Davis and Lady Sylvia Ashley; Virginia Rappe (Fatty Arbuckle scandal); Douglas Fairbanks (Sr. & Jr.), Jayne Mansfield, Alfalfa, Dagwood Bumstead, Fay Wray,Tyrone Power, Peter Lorre, Rudolf Valentino, Mel Blanc, Cecil B. DeMille and Don Adams to name a few who lay in rest here. I originally visited the cemetery back in the early 2000's when it was in severe neglect. The cemetery has been much improved and preserved since then. The offerings by Hollywood Forever Cemetery are an added bonus! Trully worth taking the time while here to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarriorNewJersey
20,Map and grounds don't add up,"I was so excited to visit this place having gone to many cemeteries in the past including Pere' LaChaise in Paris. Although I did my research online for sections, plots and grave numbers, I went to the flower shop and invested $5 for their map. Well, we looked everywhere and only stumbled upon a couple of graves listed on the map. No one was buried where the map stated (or else we just are lousy map readers - NOT). Don't waste your time or effort!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LIDuck428
40,A surprisingly cool place to attend an event!,"I have been to LA several times and done some of the typical Hollywood stuff, but nothing like this. My friend & I attended a party/concert/movie at Hollywood Forever and while I was originally pretty skeptical - it turned out to be one of the coolest things I've done when visiting. The cemetery itself was pretty 'eh' to me - although it is gorgeous - but the way they execute events there is awesome. You can bring in your own alcohol (and everyone does) or buy it there. Food trucks are typically lined up around the lawn area, which was nice but you can also pack your own picnic. It was quite an experience! If you do go for a movie or night event DO NOT forget to bring blankets and dress appropriately. Sometimes its hard to forget how cold it gets in California at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsJennO
10,Waste of time n e,"Nice grounds, well kept. Absolutely nothing of interest to see though. Don't bother visiting - if you think of how you'd react if someone told you they were going to walk around a cemetery without visiting a grave of someone you knew, well, that's exactly like it is. Do not waste your time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O7739ARthomass
40,Just Visiting,"The staff was friendly, helpful and kind. If you are interested in Hollywood history this is a fascinating place to explore. The only drawback is the map for sale: the print is awfully tiny. Look up your favorite star and leave some flowers from the florist on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsDMA
30,Hollywood Haunt,"The cemetery holds a great view of the hollywood sign while exiting. It is nice to walk around especially in the northeast corner. There are many famous musicians and actors like Johnny Ramone and Rudolfo Valentino buried as well as Bugsy Siegel, very rich with history. However I walked into a mausoleum on the west side I believe and I felt very uninvited (it was just my sister and I) as I was walking in. Now my sister is a very spontaneous person and as I followed her to the rough no word of a lie we both heard something move in one of the walls. I was very creeped out and I started feeling very dizzy, I walked out instantly. Nonetheless it is a cool place. But, I'll probably will go back maybe once more in my life time. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlessandroE2
50,Better than the Hollywood walk of fame!,"We visited the Hollywood Forever cemetary as it was near the vacation home we were renting. What a great experience! it is like a whole other world once you enter the gates from the somewhat sketchy/commercial surroundlings of the neighborhood. Beautiful grounds, peacocks, swans and incredibly grandious grave markers and monuments will capture your attemtion. We found that one end of the site is devoted to Armenien folks (with outrageously over the top grave markers) and the other side more focused on old Hollywood stars. We found many big names just by wandering around - a map is not really necessary unless you are after someone specific.It is a truly beautiful and tranquil oasis in an otherwise bustling part of the city. Also, you can park for free right inside the cemetary!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/royn98
50,Worth a Visit,"This place is huge!! We had about 45 minutes to spare so we stopped by. I wish I had spent time searching some maps of the place on line because I felt a little overwhelmed. I really wanted to find Toto but never did. We meandered around for a while but could have spent a few hours here. The peacocks were beautiful and my son found a feather to take home. It is my favorite souvenir of our trip. It was very nice to have an easy, relaxing, crowd and cost free activity. Definitely add to your itinerary!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharPHouston
40,Memorable,Easy to get lost in. Cemetery map was expensive and hard to follow. There are some extravagant markers in that cemetery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T6682SZsharons
40,Johnny Ramone!,Hollywood Forever is a great place to get away from all people and cars and hassles of L.A. for a little while. Lots of celebrity final resting places to seek out. It makes for a good walking tour of the grounds. You might get lucky and get to buy a bacon wrapped hot dog aka the L.A. dog from a vendor on the street on your walk to the front gates. A word about the annual Dia de Los Muertos festival held here. It used to be a very cool event where you could see memorial family members create to remember their relatives. Its kinda turned into a corporate sponsored drinking party. especially toward sundown. The heart has gone out of it. The cemetery itself however is always worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackS181
50,Best experience in L.A.,"After a few days visiting the LA area, the Cinespia movie screening at the Hollywood forever cemetery was like a breath of fresh air. Great atmosphere outside in the cemetery at night and fabulous vibes from the crowd seeing the movie. The audience engaged with the movie without being distracting and the eating and drinking was a definite plus without getting out of control. Worth it to pay for the parking pass so you don't have to stand in line forever, just make sure to try and show up just before they open the gates because spots fill up quickly on the lawn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paiges140
40,Great for Cemetery Buffs,"Lots of celebrities and musicians are buried here in Forever Cemetery.Everyone from Mel Blanc to Don Adams to Carl Switzer, aka Alfalfa from the Little Rascals. Easy to get to and there's a great view of the Hollywood sign as you exit the cemetery. The cemetery is huge but you can go to the small gift shop like we did and buy a map of where all the famous celebrities are buried for $5.00 . Beautiful peacocks roam the park. There's also a Buddhist burial area that's interesting too near the front entrance and public bathrooms. Plan on spending about two hours here.If your into cemeteries or just want to do something different in L.A then come check this place out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aerowing
50,Great Movie Experience!,"You must be asking, great movie experience? On Saturday evenings during the summer months they show a movie agains one of the mausoleum and it's a great experience. You can bring your own food and drinks and that includes alcohol. The movies that are shown are older movies...the night we went they showed Jaws. Haven't seen that movie in years and it was a nice evening and I couldn't believe how many people showed up. Would recommend buying tickets in advance and if you do any research you will hear a lot of negative comments about paying to park on the crowds but we came later (before the movie started) and we didn't have any problems getting out after the movie ended. If you arrive early you will stand in line (up to 2 hours) and with so much to do in Hollywood I would rather sit further back and not waste 2 hours in line and see other things in the area. Recommend taking a blanket to sit on and a blanket to cover up. Definitely take your own food and alcohol beverages. If you go you won't be disappointed that you went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,It's The Dead Center Of Hollywood!,"This is an oasis of calm and tranquility in noisy, miserable, overcrowded, pretentious Hollywood, Southern California. Not only that, but you'll get some walking exercise and a be on a treasure hunt of graves, markers, and statuary.But first you'll need to engage with the ""Flower Shop Lady"" to buy the treasure map, because without it you'll spend hours wandering aimlessly.Now you have to plan your route. Indian section? Jewish Section? Mausoleums? Lawns? Make time to visit the Peacocks, too! Well worth a side trip, to the only things alive around here (the Flower Shop Lady gets a PASS - pulse or no pulse she's part of the tour).Enjoy! Miss this BODY of work, and you'll leave DEAD wrong, so prepare to have the time of your LIFE! Don't worry, the ones you came to visit won't be leaving early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M6053QUpeters
50,A movie/Hollywood fan's must see.,"You won't be creeped out! Honest. You won't. If you are a fan of movies, particular older one's this is the place to ""see"" some of your favorite stars. Well, at least where they rest. A map is available but my wife and I explored on our own. We were somewhat on a minro time limit but we did spend a good 2 to 3 hours here and will go back. It is old, yes, very old and some areas do look it but it has a charm all it's own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milotian
50,Fascinating memorial park,"I visited Hollywood Forever Cemetery on May 14 while we were in Los Angeles. There are guided group tours available but none were scheduled the day I was there. Upon entering the grounds, there is a flower/gift shop on the right where you can get a map showing the resting places of many famous movie/television personalities---Estelle Getty (The Golden Girls), Carl Switzer (Alfalfa on Our Gang comedies), Mel Blanc, Rudolf Valentino, Fay Wray and many more.This is a very well kept, manicured garden-style park, with free roaming peacocks. If you go on your own like I did, and walk the grounds, be sure and take bottled water to drink...it got up 100 degrees the day I visited. The park is located on Santa Monica Boulevard and the surrounding area is very busy, but inside the cemetery you hear no road noise. It is a very respectful dignified cemetery, full of history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patnf
40,Charming free attraction away from the tourists,"This beautiful cemetery, although not as large or grand as the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, has a similar charm. My wife and I did a quick drive into the cemetery and enjoyed the well kept grounds and landscaping. The highlights of the cemetery include Johnny Ramones headstone, Mel Blanc's ""That's All Folks"", gothic crypts, and the peacocks roaming the grounds.You can purchase a map at the main entrance or go on the cemetery website for an online map. Or just ask the friendly groundskeepers as we did for directions.Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles is just north of here if you're looking for a bite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinter17

40,Great movie watching during summer at Hollywood Forever Cemetery,"In addition to being the final resting place for many celebrities, summer brings a whole other reason to visit Hollywood Forever. Movies are screened here outdoors & you're allowed to bring your own food (no BBQing allowed) and your own drinks, including beer or wine. As you'll be viewing the movie from the grass area, bring a blanket to sit on or low beach chairs as no tall chairs are allowed. Movies are shown every Saturday night thruout the summer. Doors open at 7:30 p.m. and you can listen to the DJ as you eat. The movie begins at 9:00 p.m. Last year they did a tribute to the movie Saturday Night Fever and Donna Pescow made an appearance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847georgeb

40,Quiet peaceful beautiful flowers amazing peacocks,"The rich, famous and infamous are buried or entombed in this restful garden like cemetery. From Estelle Getty to Bugsy Seigle to a special marker for Hattie McDaniels (who was not allowed to be buried there because of her race) this is a little bit of history. Although not available on our visit - often films are shown here - BYO chair, blanket and bottle. What fun to watch a silent film by the grave of Douglas Fairbanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conquesthistory
50,Interesting and quiet place to visit the dead,"We lived near by, so we decided to visit there for a bit before we head back to Dallas. The cemetery is very well kept and clean.

40,"Interesting, and free!","Doesn't take more than 15-20 minutes, drive slowly around and the main graves/stones you want to see are probably close to the road. Including Mel Blanc, Toto from Wizard of Oz, Joey Ramone, and Hattie McDaniel who played Mammy in Gone With the Wind. Nice leisurely visit with no charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sassysaint
50,Interesting place to spend some time,"Lots to take in here. The grounds are well kept and you can feel the age of the place as you walk through as you pass massive headstones.

50,"if you like cemeteries, this is your spot","OK, my grandparents are buried here (in the Jewish section, Beth Olam), but Hollywood Forever is for everyone, resident and visitor alike. Just down the road from Paramount Studios and Astro Burger, it's a great spot for a walk and discovery of all the famous people buried here. In the summer, there's an outdoor movie series, another great event. Really worth a visit for a bit of Los Angeles history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraK_13
40,Very impressive cemetery,"An oasis of peace in the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. A beautifully maintained cemetery. You can drive around in your car and stop at your convenience to stroll around the grounds.

40,Forget the Entrance.,"Do not let the entrance put you off it is on a not so tidy back street area, lovely place to walk around and see some of the famous graves, some really impressive tomb stones Cecil B De Mills comes to mind, Dont forget to look behind you a see the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28PatH
40,Tracking Hollywood...old and new,"Get your walking shoes on! This place is bigger than you think! We found an interesting assortment of celebs here. Rudolph Valentino, Tyrone Power, Jayne Mansfield, Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Jr., A monument to the dog Toto (The Wizard of Oz), a tribute to Hattie McDaniel (who was not allowed to be buried here because it was segregated at the time),A private family mausoleum in the middle of a lake for William Clark, Jr., who was the founder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Two of The Ramones, and even the famous gangster Bugsy Siegel! There are many beautiful stained glass windows and also a Rolls Royce hearse. In the summer, they have movie night, where people bring picnic baskets, chairs and blankets and watch films projected on the marble wall of the mausoleum. There are also music concerts. It's quite a beautiful place and worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
20,Hollywood Forever,"A little disappointing on the two days we visited. The cemetary closed early on both days with no advance notice. The main vaults were also locked up both days, so we didn't see many 'celebrity' resting places. I note that reviews talk about purchasing a map from the surly woman at the front gate. We ran into surly staffers, but no maps were available, so it was a real random walk around. Still - as the last place in LA with free parking, it wasn't a bad place to while away a few hours....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/007_nic
50,Awesome Historic Cemetery,"This is a cool place to visit if you love the stars of old Hollywood. You can buy a map at the front gate from the lady in the office. Dee Dee Ramones grave was awesome to see, and there is a memorial statue of Johnny Ramone, but he is not actually buried at the cemetery. You can also visit the graves of Mel Blanc, Rudolph Valentino, Jane Mansfield, Douglas Fairbanks, to name a few. I wish I had more time to explore the cemetery, hopefully next time I will when I am in Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irisheyes_777

30,"Nice place to visit for a few hours, security are a bit much.","It was nice to see the resting places of some great like Johnny & Dee Dee Ramone, Mel Blanc and Hattie McDaniel. Maps can be bought from the surly woman at the front gate shop but you will spend a bit of time trying to find some spots as the maps are a bit rough.When returning to our car, the security guard sped up to us (my wife and I) in his car and started questioning us about whether we were doing a photo shoot in the cemetery. I said we weren't, because we weren't!, then he made me go through all my photos and delete any that weren't of celebrity head stones. This was disappointing as there are some really unique pieces to be found and this is the first time this has happened me in any cemetery I've been in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JGilleese

40,An Acquired Taste,"Hollywood Forever is an historic cemetery that is home to some older Hollywood Stars. It started as an old Jewish cemetery but over the years has expanded. It IS a cemetery so unless you like exploring cemeteries, this isn't for you. What is has become famous for in the last 10 years is its summer film series which provides for an admission charge, a movie shown on the wall of the mausoleum. The audience sits on the lawn, no not on the graves. They bring blankets, chairs and picnics. Look for the peacocks, the tower grave markers and the many children's graves against the east wall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveSantahohoho
40,The elite cemetery for the discerning dead.,"A decent place to walk around and see a lot of dearly departed famous names. They also have some great events like late night movies and ""Day of the Dead"" celebrations in October.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven

40,Joey Ramone and Peacocks,"Really I got lost and stumbled onto this place. I was looking for somewhere else and needed to rest after driving. Its really nice here, pond, rose bushes, thick grass and lots of famous people buried here. I circled once and I saw Joey Ramone bronze statue, in all coolness. A peacock fanned out its feathers beautifully. And then I drove out to find my hotel. Great place to relax and existentialize.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angier287
40,"Time to ""Kill""","If you have time to ""kill"" it is worth the visit. It is a different look at Hollywod and its past. The grounds are kept magnificent and it is kind of an interesting self guided tour. There are a few websites that can help guide you through the tour. http://www.seeing-stars.com/Buried2/HollywoodMemorial3.shtml",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelforfun2009
40,A beautiful park and very friendly tourist attraction.,"A beautiful park full of amazing scenery. Big but not TOO big. You can walk around the whole park, unlike Forest Lawn, which you definitely would need a car for. Many famous people are resting here, and with a little research, you can find them, and the flower shop there even sells a map for a few bucks that tells you where the stars are buried!! That's good customer service for you!! :) Unlike Forest Lawn, I hear they really discourage 'stargazing' and certainly don't ask them where so and so is buried.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YEthanO
50,"Moving, serene","We are huge loony tunes fans, so it was moving to visit the grave of beloved Mel Blanc. Our teens were raised on his work and we all felt that his resting place was special. The park is very interesting and a nice place to slow down and adjust your perspective.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yeahbut246
10,Waste of time,"Fought traffic for two hours to get here. Waited half hour for cashier in flower shop to return to get a map and then she was rude about it, No one to speak of is buried here except Charlie Chaplin which was behind a locked gate when we got there two hours before closing. The only thing this place has going for it is the peaceful setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieF367

40,One of the most interesting cemeteries around.,"Our visit to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery (HFC) was interesting and generally quite pleasurable. It is a large cemetery, densely packed with graves. Many graves are opulently attired in massive tombstones with the picture of the interred engraved thereon. There appears to be a heavy occupancy of lavish Jewish and Armenian graves. Of course, they also have about four mausoleums.The cemetery grounds and burial sites are well organized, laid out, and maintained.We chose a self-guided celebrities tour using a $5 map purchased at the cemetery’s flower shop. The map listed the celebrities’ approximate locations only. The back side of the map listed the names of the celebrities with their assigned location numbers in their assigned sections. The front side of the map was the graphic layout displaying the positions of the celebrities’ location numbers (listed on the back of the map). The map was a guide only and was somewhat inaccurate in its layout and lacking in its ability to clearly show the location of the burial sites. For example: The map will show that celebrity #112 (Nelson Riddle) is located in the Hall of David, section T1. When one gets to the map’s location, there are hundreds of tombs there and none is identified with a corresponding number to match the lists on the back of the map. One, therefore, must read all the names on all the tombs until s/he finds “Nelson Riddle.” Good luck in the dark mausoleums. We never found Nelson Riddle! This was applicable to all the mausoleums. The tombs in the ground required a lot of walking and retracing steps for all but the very large and obvious tombs. The map only gets you in the general area and, once again, one has to start reading every grave marker. We got serious headaches!Advice, take one of the HFC guided tours when it is available. Call them for that information. Anybody want a nice used map?I would have given the Hollywood Forever Cemetery a full five stars, but there were a couple small irritants: Security politely got after us for photographing tombs that were anything other than those of the celebrities. Reason: Living families of the departed were offended by seeing their loved ones’ pictures if they appeared on the Internet. I don’t recall seeing this photography restriction identified on the HFC web site or elsewhere. There is free parking everywhere inside the cemetery. Just don’t park up front near the offices as we did or security will get after you for that too.The bathrooms near the flower shop were virtually useless. Both the men’s and the women’s restrooms were lacking door knobs on the inside. A lady got locked in the restroom while we were there. The men’s room looked as though it had been vandalized. Wads of paper were strewn about and stuffed in the urinal. We ended up using the restrooms in the front office.If you need drinks or snacks, vending machines are provided in front of the flower shop. Watch the drink machine; I had to fight it to get the door open to retrieve my drink. The prices are fair.I thought I saw somewhere that there is an entrance fee to the Cemetery. We saw no such requirement and got in for nothing. Do we have a “whoops” here?Those little irritants aside, I would highly recommend a visit to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisG509
50,Personal Favorite L.A. Cemetery,"I've visited Los Angeles/Hollywood, the surrounding area a total of two times. I'll be visiting L.A. and the area again in October 2013. To make a long story short, if your new to the area, or planning to visit Los Angeles/Hollywood, SoCal. Hollywood Forever Cemetery should definitely be on your list of attractions to checkout. Many of the movers and shakers of early filmdom are buried there. You have silent era heartthrob Rudolf Valentino, prolific film director Cecil B. DeMille, and an insane amount of other Hollywood luminaries. A highlight of the cemetery are the tours given by Karie Bible. If history is your thing, you will get all that and more at Hollywood Forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrMorbid
50,Excellent tour that you can walk by yourself,"We had a little difficult finding parking since we did not know that we could park inside. Then it took us a few minutes to find a map that could take us to Johnny and Dee Dee Ramone graves. They sell them at the flower store for $5 that is at the entrance. The place if beautiful, nice to walk. Perfectly secured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/covac82
50,This is another Free attraction,"Hollywood Forever CemeteryThis stop has to be one of the weirdest stops on Route 66, but it is a free attraction, and it can be interesting, so pull of a see the Dead centre of LA.All my reviews are written from the heart, and how each place made me feel, I never write a negative review, due to the fact that if I have a problem or complaint, I open my mouth while I am there, let’s be fair and give people a chance to rectify problems, stop all this negativity.Lee Wood at Pendle Pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PendlePictures
50,A great tour,Took Karie Bible's tour of the cemetery and enjoyed the many stories of the famous and infamous folks who are buried there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NJCathi
40,An interesting place to visit.,"A lot of Old Hollywood and Silent films stars are buried here along with memorials of other stars. Among those buried here are Rudolph Valentino, Fay Wray, Jayne Mansfield, Cecil B. Demille, Alfalfa (Little Rascals), and Estelle Getty. The mausoleum closes at 4pm. They also show movies at night here. This is a picturesque cemetery. A must do if you are in the Hollywood area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjsanchez
40,Different but worth visiting,"Although cemeteries are usually not your typical points of interest when visiting a new city, it does actually provide a nice stroll in the past, they are historically interesting and...quiet. This one I think is a must see in the city of L.A. You find yourself in a big and lovely park, beautifully landscaped. You can get a map at the gift shop and go visit the resting places of the legends of Hollywood. We missed the guided tour which I am sure would have provided us with so much more information but strolling around was worth it! It was so relaxing to leave the traffic of L.A. ,To find ourselves in this beautiful place, people come here to relax and enjoy the scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/518CorinneD
50,Most beautiful graveyard,"Surely I was there for Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone's graves. The place is just amazing, tranquil and nicely landscaped. I HATE that american's have be able to drive cars inside graveyard and the larger roads are really sized based on this fact. Instructions how to find these two graves. From the gate, walk left along the building and wall. When you see pond at your forward right, turn to road going aside of it. The Dee Dee's grave is immediately at cross road. Continue walk the road at other end of the pond, where you can see the statue of Johnny Ramone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirRahikkala
50,Just beautiful...,"This cemetery is very beautiful. Looks like a park and you will find lots and lots of graves of famous people like Jayne Mansfield, Tyrone Power, Estelle Getty, Johnny Ramone and many more...

50,"If you can't see them alive, you can see them dead.","The Hollywood Walk of Fame just has terrazzo stars embedded in the side walks, here you get the head stone and corpse too. Seriously, this place is great for old Hollywood Movie fans and it is very much alive with special events. Definitely visit for the summer movie screenings. 1000s attend with wine and picnic dinners and movies are projected on the back of a crypt. Great vibe, Los Angeles rarely gets friendlier than this. Hollywood Forever is also famous for it Dia de Los Muertos (Halloween) festival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/820KurtB
50,A must-visit for cemetery enthusiasts and entertainment buffs,"Odd as it may be, I love cemeteries. I love the history and the stories and the e memories people leave behind. Hollywood Forever is the best of everything - the people, the scenery, the legends. The cemetery itself is beautiful, has great views of the Hollywood sign, and is the final resting place of both average folks and entertainment legends. You could easily spend a few hours wandering around, just taking it all in. I've made several visits and love it more every time I go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chel-belle
30,Buy the $5.00 map or remain lost.,This is something cool to do if you like Graveyards. We attempted to search for movie stars with no luck. A $5.00 map saved the day and what would have been an eternity trying to find a well know grave. Although this a place that welcomes tourist I was a little upset at 2pm as I was looking for Valentino's resting place a security guard starting screaming at the top of his lungs it's 2 o'clock time to get out!!!!! This was loud enough to wake up the dead and startle the living. I found this disrespectful as this is a working cemetery. Lesson here is if you wanna see Valentino get there before 2pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BENM287
50,Like nothing we have seen before,"We enjoy visiting cemeteries, so when we had a few extra minutes in the area, we pulled into Hollywood Forever to drive around. This cemetery was like nothing we have seen before! The headstones here are gorgeous--most are black with the deceased's picture engraved on them. To drive or walk this cemetery with row upon row like this is amazing. We did not have time to check out the ""celebrities"" buried here (we did see Toto's stone--he's not in Kansas anymore!) but we would have liked to have had more time to appreciate the regular people's plots and to walk the well-kept grounds around the huge crypts and monuments.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudyC511

50,Forever beautiful resting place,"We visited the graveyard late December, it was such a beautiful place with some very well known people laid to rest there. Very well kept with maps of famous peoples grave sites so your not walking around trying to find them blindly. Very interesting place, we wished we had more time to explore the place as its so big, so make sure u give yourself a few hrs to do so, great photo`s of interesting head stones & old tombs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonH553
50,A must see for any trip to Hollywood,"Decided to visit this cemetery, as it was something 'different' - lovely place, very peaceful and tranquil, many famous are buried here, including Rudolph Valentino and Hattie McDaniel (Gone with the Wind). We travelled in December, but weather was perfect, and the infamous 'Hollywood' Sign can be seen in the distance, making sure you never forget where you are!!!.. Recommended!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenny1966
50,Not as spooky as i thought,"Went here for Dia De Los Muertos - what a great time!Lots of different memorials setup, lots of painted faces, people get very creative for this event.We also enjoyed some music and beers over by the main stage.Overall a great place to visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsluy
40,Very interesting,"A must see in my opinion. The largest amount of celebrities in one place! The on site flower shop sells a nice book about the many celebrities laid to rest there, with a map to guide you to pay your respects. It is very large, and very interesting. Of course, you must remember it is not just celebs buried here, it is not simply a tourist attraction!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhiRa
50,One of the best places to find royalty..Bugsy's here too!,"Having lived in San Diego our entire lives, we have never been wise enough to come up north and experience the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, if you're thinking about visiting, you MUST try and take a tour with the charming, knowledgeable and interesting Miss Karrie Bible.I believe if you go on HF website you will find info about her tours or you can find her on face book. We've taken two tours, one called ""Old Hollywood"" I think and the most recent one, ""Jewish Heritage"" tour. Although you can stumble about the entire place on your own and it's true, like another reviewer said, you will come across someone famous every few steps, it's best to go with an expert. And Karrie is an expert.She has been interviewed numerous times, been featured on the TCM channel and in print as well. She is a tiny little thing but the energy she exudes is strong and you will find yourself swept away by her knowledge of not just old Hollywood but so much more.Both tours ran over the two hour stated time limit as she doesn't hurry you along, answers each and every question with patience and professionalism and inserts little tidbits here and there. What was amazing about the Hollywood Forever Cemetery was how beautiful it was. Compared to the flat lawns of Forest Lawn, you'll see a lot of unusual grave markers, from the very simple to the quite ornate. There are also various crypts that dot the landscape.Then there's the mausoleums, some with gorgeous stained glass windows and others with a unique pink or yellow lighting within its walls. There's a section just for those who are Jewish and be sure to check out the Buddhist Cemetary for grave markers that are definitely something you may not have seen before.In the far back, right side of the cemetery is a hidden garden dedicated to Anne Frank and a huge piano and faux living room set up in the mausoleum that houses Bugsy Sigel.You can park your car directly on the grounds and move it around as it is a big place...this cemetery is as much a burial ground as it is an art museum. There are also bathrooms near the front office.Read the other reviews for history and who's buried here but if you can take Karrie's tour. She took us to places and corners we would've never come across on our own and takes into account that on her walking tour not everyone is up to walking at a fast clip.Case in point, me. I have had to use a cane the last couple of months and on our last tour I also fell out because of the heat and had to bail from the tour early. My husband told me later that she asked him several times if I was okay and was concerned that other older folks on the tour were okay as well.Each tour is $15 a person, payable upon the completion of the tour and should you feel moved to give her a BIG FAT TIP, you should def do that. You meet in front of the flower shop and there are no reservations needed. She is well worth it and the easy way she share's her knowledge with you is far better than any other tour in Hollywood (IMHO of course.) Enjoy...you won't regret it but do wear good walking shoes and bring sunscreen if it's sunny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBTL2019
40,Walked through here after visiting Paramount Studios.,I was amazed to see the really posh and exotic headstones. There are some famous people resting here too. It's a really peaceful place too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshinemags
20,Tourist trap,This tourist trap will let you see the dead famous folks. It's like a wax museum for the departed. Save your money and see something else.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CB731
40,final resting place of Old Hollywood,"A very easy location to drive to and simply park, grab a map and set off in search of history . Had never been to Hollywood Forever, even i. The summer when they do the movie screenings, but this was better for our multi-generational group...uncrowded,serene ( except for the new construction on the Cathedral Mausoleum where Rudolph Valentino is interred-- just adding on room for more!).The security guards were very helpful in guiding us and giving information. The website showed there was an ""interactive map"" but could not access it, so had to go with the $5 map ( which is very, very basic) from the flower shop. The grounds are interesting alone, and the everr changing melting pot that is LA, including very large and elaborate granite and marble gravesites and monuments for current Russian and Armenian families, to the childrens section along the far wall, to old Hollywood stars final resting places at are surprisingly simple..or elegant. our twenty-somethings in our group didn't recognize most of the names ( had to explain Rudolph Valentino and make reference to the ""first"" King Kong movie for Fay Wray, but they did get the Ramones. you could spent hours here, either doing your research beforehand so you know the personal history of those you are seeing, or bring a mobile device and get backgrounds along the way. There are more interesting locations around every turn..in the cathedral Mausoleum for instance, in the cremation section, behind small glass doors are the urn and memorabilia, including his role as a grandpa, of David White, the irritating boss Larry Tate in the original TV series "" Bewitched"". Are planning a trip back to get the full and multiple stories of those who had such public ( and not so public) fascinating lives. Tip: Groundskeepers seriously overwater, so there are patches of very squishy and slippery mud. the Canadian geese leave copious green droppings, so watch where you are stepping and wear flat bottomed shoes that can be more easily wiped off ( or the geese gifts will keep on giving)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wdee2013
40,Different,We went to this towards closing time and was able to run through quickly. You need to buy a map for $5 in the office before you start to see where everyone is buried. The workers were extremely nice and helpful as they opened locked doors for us to get a chance to see some of the celebrities. A lot of the people buried here are older stars who the children did not know. Definately worth a quick visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuartt144

This is a beautiful cemetery -- complete with peacocks -- that's small enough to navigate in a short period of time.

Some of the monuments are quite elaborate.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meredith5001

On the weekends during the summer, and also closer to Halloween, they show movies here. You bring a picnic dinner and a blanket and chill with friends, drink wine and enjoy a movie. It's like $10 to get in and $10 to park. Great date night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L2Connelly
40,Day of The Dead Festival,"I attended the Day of The Dead Festival at this historic cemetery. Although we went for the festival the sigh seeing in the cemetery makes it an interesting place to visit. Many of Hollywoods greatest stars are laid to rest there including ""Toto"" the dog from the movie The Wizard of Oz. Huge headstones and other grave markers fill the entire property. One of the coolest markers is that of Johnny Ramone from the punk band The Ramones. Well worth a couple hours of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingjohn1230
40,Where the movers and shakers finally rest,"Hollywood Forever is a really interesting and beautifully kept cemetery.Get yourself organised before you go, as it is pretty big! So print off a map (It will cost you $5 at the flower shop) and a list of tombstones you want to see, as you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering around.There are literally dozens of famous people here, who helped shape Hollywood and make it into the town it is today. Take your camera.The only thing I would say is that the owners/management are missing a trick by not selling a booklet giving you more information about some of the more famous residents. The map is fine, but a booklet would be better!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moogharrison

40,Go see a movie!!!,"So cool that it's a real cemetery with stars buried there, so eerie to see films there on Saturday nights. You've got to try it. The place just reeks of history. It's so neat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayS967
40,beautiful place,I couldnt believe how well maintained the cemetry was. It was really nice. Toto (the dog) from wizard of oz has a statue there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annea348
50,Mel Blank speaks from beyond the pale!,"One of the greatest headstones ever....T t t t that's all folks!Great walk through the final resting places of a lot of Hollywood greats...better than the 'Walk of Fame"" IMHO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackcU1411RE
50,This place is just a hoot,"If you just want to go there to visit celebrity graves, you will not be disappointed. Some of the non-celebrity resting places are (probably) unintentionally hilarious. You'll see what I mean when you view some of these sites. The movies are what will put you over the top. Go online for the schedule. It is a fabulously quirky experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77
50,Old Hollywood,"How many can say they watched a movie in a cemetery? Also, touring the grounds, you'll find so many names of classic movie stars, producers, directors, and other names in the business.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FranticKitten
50,don miss johnny ramone,i stopped by just for johnny - well worth it and more exciting than evita (in buenos aires). it's very easy to get to and well worth it if you are a Ramones fan!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geraldl233
50,Cinema in the Cemetery,"The Cinespia summer film series, which has been going on for over a decade, are one of those magical, only in LA experiences that you shouldn't miss. At this point, I generally go once a summer to see a classic film under the stars in cemetery populated by some of the greatest stars of Hollywood's past.This summer, I went to see Jurassic Park on the 3rd of July, complete with a spectacular fireworks show (the first fireworks went off when the T-Rex roars in triumph at the end of the movie). Jurassic Park is one of my favorite (and most formative) movies, but the great thing about the Cinespia series is they screen more than just Hollywood blockbusters. Cult cinema and black and white classics also fill out their schedule, with Billy Wilder and Hitchcock masterpieces generally selling out as quickly as popular hits from more recent years like Labyrinth or Heahters. DJs spin before and after the films, and you're encouraged to bring picnics (including wine and beer). A lovely night for cinema lovers that honors the entire history of the medium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethG527
50,Forever Cemetery,"Make sure you stop in the Flower and Gift Shop and get a map. It is only 5 dollars and hellos you locate your favorite stars from the golden age of Hollywood. The grounds are beautiful and so well kept. This cemetery is on the backside of Paramount Studio. SOme of the famous names - Rudolf Valentino, Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks, Cecil B DeMille, Jayne Mansfield. If you arent an old film buff, you can leave a guitar pick at Dee Dee and Johnny Ramone. Check out the website for the cemetery to get a complete list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyE341
50,Summer Movies under (and over) the Stars!,"A film viewing experience like no other, HFC film nights are fun, festive and not at all creepy (unless the film is a horror flick). Projected against a wide wall a stones throw from the back of Paramount Studios, classic movies are shown to picnicking visitors stretched out on a large grass field (there are no burials where visitors sit). I've seen Hitchcock's The Birds and Moulin Rouge. A unique L.A. experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightPro
50,Amazing location for a concert...or just a day of reflection,"Go. It's hollywood, it's unusual, it's fascinating. There are loads of famous folks buried here, but it's the regular folks and all those who visit that make this a fascinating destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skinnedknee
50,"Fun, fun & more fun","We were skeptical about heading to a cemetery to watch an 80's movie, especially one we'd seen over 100 times like The Terminator, but we're sure glad that we went. Sitting in the cemetery is fun, and the lawn area is clear of headstones. The atmosphere is great, and picnics are encouraged. Not the best place to bring your kids, even though there are a couple families there, but there's plenty of smoking both legal, and semi-legal substances. Drinking is encouraged, and the BYOB style works well. We sandwiches from a local deli and plenty of dessert to tie us over with a sugar rush till the end of the movie. Even with this being a well known flick, cheering during the fun deaths made the environment more enjoyable. You may even get to see some famous people join in the fun, as Aaron Paul from Breaking Bad was sitting just across the aisle from us. I would definitely suggest this for a fun Hollywood experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianG219
40,What else; Hollywood movies at Hollywood cemetry,"Hollywood Forever has many famous actors & actress' as residents forever.What an ideal location to see classic movies. We are seeing ""Sunset Blvd"" near thelocation where it was produced - - how neat is that!Bring a picnic basket (wine & beer is ok too) and munch / sip while you enjoy aREAL Hollywood experience. Gates at 7:30, movie at 9pm Google for the current schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jobeard
50,Saw a Movie There,"Went at night for an old Hollywood movie- my 14-year-old's idea. Was very enjoyable- big screen, great sound, $10/person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857JenniferM
40,Worth a half day sightseeing.,"This was great to visit. If you like the Ramones you'll love the Johnny memorial, take your guitar pick so you leave it in his hand. Rudolph Valentino, Jayne Mansfield, Cecil B. De MIlle and Don Adams are just some of the grave sites. There is a very peaceful lake with some very cheeky geese roaming around. Douglas Fairbanks' memorial is a really nice water feature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vivnoname
50,Cinespia!!!!!!!,"Cinespia is a really cool outdoor movie thing they do at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. I took my 10yr old son; but, be forewarned you will be in a sea of hippies eating whole foods, burning incense and smoking pot. Bring low profile chairs and try to sit in the back on the pavement. The grass just gets wetter and wetter as the night goes on and there are no walkways, so if you need to use the restroom and are in the middle of the sea of hippies you will need to walk over everyone to get out. Also, buy your tickets in advance because they only have a limited number of tickets to buy at the gate and some people wait for hours and still do not get in. You need to pay for parking in advance too. Aside from the Getty this was the only thing is LA that did not disappoint me. It is kind of neat to see a movie projected onto the side of a mausoleum and often times the actors, writers, producers, directors, etc. are burried there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ltlmsmfft
30,Well...,Unless you have a map it will take a while to see the graves of famous celebrities and it is a cemetery so...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcie_x76
40,Hollywood's cemetery,"If you aren't freaked out about walking through a cemetery, then this is one of the more interesting ones to see. It is located on the other side of Paramount Studios back wall. The grounds are beautiful and there are many famous people interred here, including Douglas Fairbanks (Sr and Jr)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevew11
40,Hollywood FOREVER,"I love this cemetery. We were given a free map of the grounds by someone that worked there, very nice people that encourage you to walk around and take pictures. We spent at least 2 hours in the cemetery, got lots of great pictures, I attached several to my review. Next time I am in Hollywood I am visiting again.....it is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miranda77
50,Beautiful place,Drove around the cemetery of the famous. Beautiful mausoleums. Paid $10 for the map of the property though :(,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusyQinGA
50,My favorite cemetery in the LA area,"I have long been a huge fan of LA-area cemeteries, due to their high concentration of famous ""residents"". The very best one in this regard is Hollywood Forever. Independently owned (i.e., not Forest Lawn), it has more charm than any other cemetery in the region IMHO. They are happy to have you there (unlike Forest Lawn). You needn't skulk around, in fear that they'll catch you looking at Valentino's crypt or sitting on Tyrone Power's bench. Feel free! Enjoy! It's a wonderful place and well-worth a stop on your swing through Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katerz
40,cemetery of the famous,"This is a real cemetery and non famous people are also buried here so it is in use today. If your in the Hollywood area and if you want to pay your respects to Douglas Fairbanks Sr and Jr, Mel Blanc,Paul Muni,Hattie McDaniel, and about 900 others are here. Its location is like they built the city up around it. I am sure in its day it was the best or only thing around. If cemetery's do not creep you out it's worth a look see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/istanbulrocks
50,"Incredibly interesting, take the Karrie Bible tour!","Having lived in San Diego our entire lives, we have never been wise enough to come up north and experience the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, if you're thinking about visiting, you MUST try and take a tour with the charming, knowledgeable and interesting Miss Karrie Bible.I believe if you go on HF website you will find info about her tours or you can find her on face book. We've taken two tours, one called ""Old Hollywood"" I think and the most recent one, ""Jewish Heritage"" tour. Although you can stumble about the entire place on your own and it's true, like another reviewer said, you will come across someone famous every few steps, it's best to go with an expert. And Karrie is an expert.She has been interviewed numerous times, been featured on the TCM channel and in print as well. She is a tiny little thing but the energy she exudes is strong and you will find yourself swept away by her knowledge of not just old Hollywood but so much more.Both tours ran over the two hour stated time limit as she doesn't hurry you along, answers each and every question with patience and professionalism and inserts little tidbits here and there.Read the other reviews for history and who's buried here but if you can take Karrie's tour. She took us to places and corners we would've never come across on our own and takes into account that on her walking tour not everyone is up to walking at a fast clip.Case in point, me. I have had to use a cane the last couple of months and on our last tour I also fell out because of the heat and had to bail from the tour early. My husband told me later that she asked him several times if I was okay and was concerned that other older folks on the tour were okay as well.Each tour is $15 a person, payable upon the completion of the tour and should you feel moved to give her a BIG FAT TIP, you should def do that. You meet in front of the flower shop and there are no reservations needed. She is well worth it and the easy way she share's her knowledge with you is far better than any other tour in Hollywood (IMHO of course.) Enjoy...you won't regret it but do wear good walking shoes and bring sunscreen if it's sunny!Ps. As in all good cemeteries, there are restrooms by the front office, you can park your car directly on the grounds and make sure your camera is charged and your SD card is ready to go because there are dozens and dozens of old Hollywood and rock royalty buried here. By the restrooms is a small chapel where services are held, if there is not one going on at the time you are visiting, walk straight to the back, behind the velvet curtains that hang there and you will see a library of urns that will blow your mind! But remember to be respectful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CBTL2019
50,For Old School Hollywood Fans,"Upon arrival, we stopped at the office to purchase (cheap) a map of the cemetery which showed the names and burial sites of the famous. This cemetery is ""fan friendly"" and also have guided tours but we opted to explore ourselves. Therefore, the map was a necessity which helped us navigate pretty easily to the graves we wanted to visit.As a huge fan of old Hollywood, this was perfect.......Peter Lorre, Darren McGavin, Vampira, Tyrone Power, Douglas Fairbanks sr. & jr., Cecil B. DeMille, and Bugsy Siegal.......just to name a few!The highlight was visiting Rudolph Valentino's grave and it just happened to be the anniversary of his death so there were quite a few flowers.With the Hollywood Hills as the back drop, this place will make you nostalgic for old Hollywood! Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShopBread
40,Paying homage,My bf & I visited this site on our recent vacation in LA...My bf wanted to see the Ramones & me Valentino! We got a map from the Flower shop...they're $5 which you don't really need since the cemetery is quite small & you will recognize the major landmark graves... but definitely worth chatting up the woman at the shop! She was fabulously helpful & laid out for us in minute detail where we could find each grave. When we had problems finding Joe Bocans grave she even came with us to point it out...what a sweetheart she was! Okay yes I admit its a little weird as a tourist attractions but its a Hollywood landmark we both didn't want to miss!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sembriaco
50,The real history of Hollywood.,"A beautifully kept cemetery that not only attracts the movie fans, it has an historic aspect showing how Holywood evloved. A wonderful place to wander and commune with your spiritual side. The guide map is worth buying at $5 so that you can find what you are looking for and also understand the nature of the cemetery. Look out for the peacocks. Great views of the Hollywood Sign through the trees.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Bren_248
50,Great place for Hollywood movie buffs,"For those of us interested in the history of the movies and Hollywood, Forever Hollywood is a definite must-see. Isn't lurking around a cemetery a little creepy, one might ask... not this cemetery, which is a lovely tranquil place though quite busy with visitors like me.Stop in at the Flower Shop right inside the gate for a $5 map. Unlike the bigger Forest Lawns around LA, Forever Hollywood is very open and welcoming about ""visiting their residents."" And you'll find a huge assortment here (and you do need the map though the place isn't huge) -- Rudolph Valentino, Marion Davies (look for ""Dovras"" mausoleum next to the pretty lake), John Huston, Mel Blanc (""That's all Folks"" on his headstone), Douglas Fairbanks and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Nelson Eddy, Johnny and Dee Dee Ramone, Jayne Mansfield, Peter Finch, Adolphe Menjou, Eleanor Powell, Don Adams, Tyrone Power, Vampira, Cecil B. DeMille, Harry Cohn, Peter Lorre, Paul Muni, Estelle Getty, Victor Fleming, Ann Sheridan, Norma Talmadge and Janet Gaynor, for starters. This is a quite unassuming place with the stars sprinkled in amongst ""regular people"" - there's a vast array of interesting headstones and memorials about the grounds. Visitors are respectful and you won't be looking around alone. Worth spending some time there seeking out your personal favorites -- I really enjoyed my afternoon paying my respects.The other similar place I'd truly recommend for movie buffs is Westwood Memorial Park tucked away between office buildings off Wilshire Blvd. -- very different but very special as a place of ""movie buff pilgrimage.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnieEC
40,I see dead stars,"Second visit, this time we bought the map for $5 and it was well worth it. Beautiful grounds A great stop after the Paramount Tour on the way to Hollywood and Highland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNystedt
50,MOVIES!,"This is one of the most interesting LA activities. On Wednesday nights they play movies in the cemetery. Bring blankets, wine, packed dinner, all the fixings. You can bring food and drinks into the cemetery. Come very early to get in line (you can eat and drink in line as well) it will be worth it to get a good seat on the lawn. it is always very crowded. I recommend going at 5 at the latest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ktmonster
40,Well taken care of.,This cemetry is amazing. The age and design of some of the headstones are incredible. This cemetry also features quite a few masoleums. There are also movie nights in the cemetry during the summer. Great fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudeTraveler
50,Immortalized in Stone,"This is a little gem in Hollywood/Los Angeles that many seldom ever recognize as a 'site-seeing' venue. On warm summer nights, you can watch movies on the main lawn with the maulsoleum as the blank canvas for the featured movie. Bring a picnic lunch and plan to make friends. Parking is a bear, but well worth the effort. When planning to watch a movie there, leave early and plan to see all the famous movie stars final resting places. Some names you'll be impressed to see is Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Johnny Ramone (of the Ramones), and so many, many more famous names! Dont forget to visit during ""Dia De Los Muertos"" in the beginning of Novemeber.. where all those come to pay a tribute to thier loved ones with vibrantly colored alters, candles, food, festivities and more!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockiM
40,If you like Hollywood and its history and stars...,"This is the place for a visit. You can stroll among the gravestones and in front of the mausoleum and be amazed at the names you read along the way. Take a camera so you can share with your friends who can't make it to Hollywood. Among those buried at Forever Cemetery are Charlie Chaplin, Charles Young, Tyrone Power, Jayne Mansfield, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Nelson Eddy, Cecil B. De Mille, June Mathis and more...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BJ928
40,"The cemetery that inspired ""Six Feet Under""","Or so rumor has it. Some Hollywood legend are buried here, and it's fun to find the graves. If you know who Tyrone Power is, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours. If the name doesn't ring a bell, just come on weekend nights in the summer for the free movies they show outdoors. Seeing Valentino's vault is macabre and romantic - pure Old Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phineas55

50,See a concert here on a Summer's evening,"Hands down- the best place in LA to see an outdoor rock show.Saw The Flaming Lips here. Nothing- compares! No nasty security to harsh your high. People are all in good moods. You can bring a picnic, wine and a blanket!For Daytime visits: Use the website gravefinder to locate all your favorite silver screen stars final resting places.Be sure to pay homage to Joey Ramone's final resting place",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacannes
40,Spooky.,They have a fun outdoor vintage movie run in the summer. Take a picnic and enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samwabs
50,Movies!,"The summer movie nights are worth the effort. Where else can you see a movie in a graveyard? Really fun. Dia de los Muertos--worth doing once but too crowded. I mean really crowded--like you can't even walk. The altars were magnificent, but it felt creepy that people were walking, sitting, and eating all over the grave sites. It was a carnival on the graves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeatriceBloom
50,Beautiful Grounds,"Neat place to check out and find final resting places of ""Old Hollywood,"" like Rudy Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks. Stars like Estelle Getty and Mel Blanc are buried here, too. Definately worth taking a couple of hours to check out!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GhostHuntingDiva
40,Awesome,"It was really interesting to walk the grave yard, we got there too late for a tour though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaM970
40,Day of the Dead Festival,A little pricey $18 including parking was too expensive to look at a graveyard and spend more money on (delicious) vendor food. Many clean port-a-potty bathrooms. Festival was interesting but need to go back when not so crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueC398
40,Cinespia Movie in the Cemetary: so much fun!,"Get there early! Lawn space fills up quickly! Bring a blanket to lay on, warm clothes, snacks and beer/wine. Do not bring high chairs, very frustrating to viewers behind you and also not permitted. There are lots of private parking lots around for $6+. Go as a date or with a bunch of friends! Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurarT9399JT
30,"Ok, but don't buy the map","We had about an hour to kill before getting on line to see a show at a TV studio, so we went to the cemetery. I love cemeteries, and I enjoyed looking at this one. It's in great shape, and it has a very interesting mix of mausoleums and unusual headstones. A lot reference unknown people who worked in film or music, which was pretty cool. The disappoinment is that the map with the name of stars is not well-drawn, and it's almost impossible to find who you're looking for. We found the Joey and DeeDee Ramone pretty easily (not near each other, which is weird), but couldn't find Jane Mansfield. And we found Charlie Chaplin almost by accident, as he's literally one of about 2,000 plaques on a wall in a giant mausoleum -- no joking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allen1000
40,Don't get caught there after dark!!,"Puts the ""creep"" in ""creepy""...........we loved it. Hollywood's immortals meet mortality, including Valentino, DeMille, Johnny Ramone,Don Adams, and a host of other burnt out former luminaries.. Definitely worth the visit!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/38garyv
40,Cemetery to the stars,"So what did you see in Hollywood? Most people won't consider a visit to a cemetery to be one of the highlights of their vacation. Hollywood Forever just might prove you wrong.After a period of neglect, Hollywood Forever is enjoying a Renaissance of sorts. The new owners have done a good job of promoting HF's status as Cemetery to the Stars while retaining its dignity. Sure, you'll find movie star postcards in the gift shop, but it's not overkill (pardon the pun).The buildings and grounds are immaculate. The island crypt, surrounded by a pond populated by black swans, is magnificent. The graves of Rudolph Valentino, David White, Peter Lorre, Darla Hood, Mel Blanc and others are all easily accessible. There are maps of the cemetery available online, and the gift shop employees won't mind telling you where to find your chosen celebrity.One caveat: It's important to remember that Hollywood Forever is not just a tourist attraction, but a working burial ground. You may come across funeral processions and grieving loved ones. Be respectful, be quiet, and make sure you don't intrude upon others.The area surrounding Hollywood Forever is a bit run down and dodgy. However, you can still access the cemetery without forking over a lot of money for a tour. Just take the DASH red bus from the Hollywood and Vine (right in front of the Metro entrance) and get off at Gower and Santa Monica. You'll be right down the block from the cemetery. It's quick, safe, and, at 50 cents per ride, is surely more economical than a tour!If you're planning on visiting Paramount Studios after your trip to Hollywood Forver, just hop right back on the DASH. It's a long walk, through a rather deserted neighborhood, to get to the Studios otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anonymousreviewer047
