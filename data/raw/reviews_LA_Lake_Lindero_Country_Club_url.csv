10,A sub-par course and the new management is rude.,"Just came from there. They have a notice that they were no longer honoring the range keys for hitting balls. A key that I paid $50 for. They don't have any decent records since the homeowners took over (still no cash register), but I was still honest and told him I had about $20 left. He told me if I didn't tell anybody, he would give me $10. I refused and he said he would see me in court. I used to play there once a week, but now never going back. He's losing way more revenue than he thinks.",Old Guy Bob
40,"Small par 3 course, easily walked","This is a nice place to go to get some exercise and not have to spend hours golfing. You can walk this course pretty easily, as it meanders through the local neighborhood. I actually took three clubs, a 6 and 9 iron and a putter and they handled the course just fine. I think there are maybe two holes where you could use a driver, but it's not a necessity. They also have a small driving range.",ZumaDawg
