50,“Incredibly nice”,"One of the most beautiful cities in the world . They call it the Russian Venice . The most ideal time to visit is in April and May When the climate is ideal and everything flourishes . In a few words it's hard to describe the beauty . Therefore, a must visit it . You will not be disappointed and if you good memories ."
50,“My favorite walk in St. Petersburg”,"One very pleasant option in St. Petersburg is to make a half-day walk along the embankments of canal Griboedova between the Church of the Saviour on the Blood and Mariinsky Theatre. There is no hectic traffic, and on the route you can admire neo-classical buildings and beautiful bridges (for example Lion Bridge and Bank Bridge), visit magnificent churches (f.ex. Nikolskaya baroque cathedral near Mariinsky Theatre) and follow the footsteps of Dostoevsky near Haymarket Square. Add to this walk a guided boat tour in the main canals Moika and Fontanka, and you have seen the best part of St. Petersburg.A practical tip for all planning to make this walk or in general to visit St Petersburg: there’s a lot of public, clean toilets in the city center, near the main sights and squares and in the parks. In May 2013 the fee to these toilets was only 20 rubles, which is equal to about 0,5 euros or dollars."
30,“It was nice to visit the place where you were born.”,"I was very disappointed by St. Petersburg. Yes, they fixed all the churches, closed when I lived there. And obviously museums and palaces inside and outside the city. But the city itself does not look good, at least for me."
50,“Trip to Finland/Russia”,"The information from Trip Advisor provides excellent service when planning a trip to Finland and Russia. Using your service and material from Lonely Planet, you are able to plan and execute a wonderful individualized trip to Helsinki, Porvoo, Turku, Viipuri-Vyborg, and St Petersburg. A traveller is able to arrange accommodation, train tickets, car rentals, tour tickets and a return cruise from St Petersburg to Helsinki. The information from both services is accurate, up-to-date and very accessible.Friends recommended Red Apple Apartments in Helsinki which was excellent.The forums were also very useful for information for locating PD Tours in St Petersburg, where almost a private service, 2 to 6 people, at reasonable prices, perfect English, was experienced. A very reasonable boutique hotel was recommended and was excellent (Fortecia Piter) and 2 blocks from the Hermitage.Hotels were done through Booking .com, and then through direct contact with the hotel, in English,and most other reservations were done directly with the company involved. Had a good car rental through e-bookings.com, an English firm, not so good service from cartrawler.com,Some trepidation may be experienced in getting accommodation in Vyborg, Russia. This was solved by your reader recommendation of Letuchaya Mysh, direct contact with them and through booking.comA return trip to Helsinki was a bonus as the St Peter Line have an overnight cruise with excellent food and accommodation in their cruise schedules.A very appreciative thanks for making this a wonderful trip"
50,“St. Petersburg was the highlight of our trip!!”,"We just returned from a fantastic cruise on the Baltic Sea. We saw unbelievable places filled with beauty and history - Stockholm, Helsinki, Estonia, Latvia, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Bruges.We loved all the places, but the highlight of our trip was St. Petersburg. We were there for three days. We had a fantastic tour guide, Gennadiy Chentsov, who picked us up at the ship at 9:00 AM and returned us at 6:00 PM each day. It was quite extraordinary!!Everything was arranged before hand - our visas, our reservations at all the historical places and restaurants - we had absolutely no worries or concerns. We went to unbelievable places, and wonderful restaurants for lunch each day. Someplaces we would never had seen if we had taken the cruise excursions. I cannot say enough about how our St. Petersburgexperience was so memorable!! We were there for three days, and each day was packed with so much. Our first day we went to St. Peter and Paul Fortress, St. Isaac's Cathedral and the Church of the Spilt Blood in the morning. Then we went to lunch across the water from the Church of the Spilt Blood to Cafe St. Petersburg. Absolutely delicious food - loved the borsch!!That afternoon we went to the Smolny Institute for Nobel Ladies, where the Bolshevik Headquarters were after the revolution of 1917, and where Lenin and his wife lived.The next day we went to see the statue of Peter the Great onHorseback, stopped at the monument preserving the memory of those tragic and heroic 900 days of the siege of Leningrad - 1941 - 1944. We went to Pushkin and saw the Russian Orthodox church that Tsar Nicholas and his family attended intheir last days, and where they lived at Alexander's Palace. We continued on to Catherine's Palace which is filled with history and absolutely gorgeous - blue, white and gold!! We had another delicious lunch back in St. Petersburg at CafeBernedy. Then we went to the fabulous Hermitage, which is unbelievable. Our guide was so informative about all the art works, and all the history - amazing!!Our last day we went to Peterhof, which was Peter the Great's Grand Palace overlooking the Gulf of Finland. Absolutely beautiful fountains and grounds!! For lunch we went to the Vodka museum, where we had a tour of the museum, had a snack with a sampler of vodka, and another delicious lunch. Itwas such a fun time!!! Then we went to the Yusupov Palace, which survived the wars with much of its original interior and artwork. In the cellar of this palace, Rasputin was poisoned!! So much history and so interesting. What afantastic last day we had in St. Petersburg!! It was very hard to say goodbye to St. Petersburg and our guide. St. Petersburg definitely was the highlight of our marvelous trip!!"
50,“St. Petersburg with tour guide”,"I was with my husband in St. Petersburg last August for 3 days. Dasha was with us most of the time.We had the best possible impression of the city and we are sure that she played a major role on it. We cannot think about anyone better than her to escort us around the city.Right on the first day, she took us to the Hermitage. The Hermitage is huge and you can go all day long there without seeing not even half of it. Dasha has the best timing of the museum. She made sure that we got the best of it, without having to spend the whole day. Her description of the paintings were absolutely fantastic, not to mention her knowledge about arts and history.After this great introduction, we had a wonderful time in this beautiful city. The program she prepared for us really matched perfectly with our interests and rhythm. We were in all the main spots and we also went up to Peterhof and Pushkin with her.Besides being a great tour guide, she was really fun to hang out with and spoke PERFECT English. She also gave us great tips about bars, restaurants and cultural activities.If you ever go to St. Petersburg, do not hesitate to contact Dasha. You won't regret it at all.Melissa Araripe, from Brazil"
50,“St.Peterburg with Insider Tour”,"Ten of us toured St. Petersburg and Peterhof with Insider Tour. First of all, they took care of entry documents so that we did not need visas. The tours themselves were excellent. No one should miss the Hermitage, Catherine's Palace, and the wonderful fountains of Peterhof, just to name a few of the attractions that we were taken to. In every case, our tour guide led us past all the lines and was a veritable encyclopedia of information. I would highly recommend Insider Tour and would say without hesitation that St. Petersburg was one of the highlights of our cruise."
20,“St Petersburg is definitely an experience...”,"It is beautiful, especially during the white nights but all the residents behave as if they don't want any tourists in the city. The language is a big big problem; they don't know and don't want to speak English and they are definitely not the most amiable and helpful people in the world.The shopkeepers and exchange rate kiosks are the worst, they expect you to carry the exact amount of cash in your pocket, they are angry and very rude if they have to give you some cash back, even if it is 10 Rubles!There are some nice restaurants; looking upscale and very western with some ""minor"" issues like not having an English menu. For example in one of such restaurants the only waiter who could speak English recommended us some Georgian red wine but we received some rose, sparkling wine with the starters instead. When the main dish arrived and we asked where our red wine is, he simply asked ""do you want another glass?"".It seems that the city needs at least another 10 years to fully overcome the cold war habits, learn what good service is and how to be nice to tourists."
50,“Finally after more than 20 years”,"St. PetersburgAs you all know St. Petersburg is the old capital of Russia, built in the delta of the river Neva in the 18th century. So expect all beauty that you assume with an world power of that time.My relationship with the city is a bit special. I speak Russian since I studies in the former USSR and my local guide is my girlfriend, so my view may be not always totally objective :-)Because the world is as it is the first complication when you travel to Russia is that you need a visa (at least for most people coming from Europe or the States...). This is however far less complicated than it sounds. You need some time and an invitation which you can get from various agencies in Russia via internet. If you have the possibility to visit the embassy or consulate twice you do not need further services of a visa service. Just be aware that your passport will be at the consulate for 3-5 working days.For the trip into SPb (SPb is how the locals abbreviate the name of the city) I prefer the plane. You can either look for a cheap ticket directly into SPb or take a Ryanair plane to Lappeenranta in Finland. From there a small bus brings you to SPb for 20-25 €. There is 1 problem with the route through Lappeenranta: The boarder can be crowded and then you just wait and see the time ticking knowing that planes normally don't wait...You also have trains and buses from Helsinki, ferry's from Stockholm and Helsinki but I so far did not use them.SPb is a classical beauty if it comes to the architecture - no surprise with the history.You can use a well organized system of public transport and it is rather cheap (if I compare it to Europe, Locals see that of course different). You have the choice between Metro, tram, bus and marshroutka. A marshroutka is a smaller bus, following a fixed route that stops at request to take in passengers or let them out. A trip with the Metro costs 25 roubles (0.63€) and a marshroutka costs 30 roubles (0.75€).What impressed me a lot is the Russian interpretation of fast food (it's far better than what we normally get...). I personally liked 2 chains a lot: Teremok and ""Kroshka Kartoshka"". In Teremok you get well made classical Russian food, it's really tasty and also healthy. Just try it. Kroshka Kartoshka is all about potatoes stuffed in different ways - very tasty as well.It's very nice just to walk through the city centre with the different islands and bridges. The bridges will be opened during the night to let ships pas through - than you stuck at the island where you are until the bridges close again in the morning.You like shopping? Then there is a lot to see, especially younger Russian brands in the various shops.It took me more than 20 years to make my first trip to SPb, the second followed shortly after and now I already planned a 3rd - so my conclusion it worth seeing..."
50,“How to save money in St. Petersburg (Tips)”,"We rested in St Petersburg for a week in June, 2011. The city is increadibly beautiful! I think, it is the most european city of Russia. That is why I want to tell, how we saved our money there. The secret is: we we have organized a trip by ourselves!We bought the tickets, booked the hostel, and bought the ""St. Petersburg Guest Card"".In general, it seems to me, that use the services of travel agencies to travel to Russia is nonsense! There were at least 400 cheap hostels, with prices ranging from 12 eur per night!And I advice to everyone ""St. Petersburg Guest Card"", such a favorable thing! It's an electronic card for tourists! A tourist who buys the card can take part in a city tour on a red double-decker ""City Tour"" bus! Also you can enjoy a water tour by boat!.Also the card provides for free admission to 17 museums in the city: the Peter and Paul Fortress, St. Isaac's Cathedral, The Russian Museum (including the Stroganov Palace, the Marble Palace, and the Engineer's Castle), the Church of the Savior on the Blood, Smolniy Cathedral, the Museum of ""Pavlovsk"" and many others.By the way, if you go to the State Hermitage, the card provides with not only free admission, but you also may participate in tours and have the opportunity to take photos and video footage.Everyone knows, that the price ofrussian museums is rather high. That's why the card is an excellent way for anyone.In general, I recommend to all to come to St. Petersburg! This is an incredible city! It is very nice, that you can save money too!"
50,“St Petersburg - Russia”,"We have just returned from 4 weeks in Europe, St Petersburg was the stand out city for us. We spent 5 days, 6 nights and you need this amount of time to see all that is there. . TJ travel were wonderful in setting up all our tours, and avoiding huge huge queues, and our guide really knew her history and art. Great and different experience - from speaking with friends who have done this city by cruise ship our experience was much more rewarding.RuthAustralia"
40,“Great tour guide in St. Petersburg”,"We recently visited St. Petersburg as part of a cruise. On the second day there we engaged the services of TJ Travel to take four of us on a city tour and a visit to Peterhof in a private car. We were exceptionally pleased with our experience. We were very, very pleased with our guide Sasha and the itinerary that she and Alec, our driver came up within consultation with us. We had only very general requests before we arrived and they were flexible and most cooperative. Sasha was an excellent guide, spoke wonderful English and made sure that we were able to see all the highlights in the city before we took the hydrofoil to Peterhof. On the previous day we had seen the city, but without any stops. We were able to visit the Great Synagogue, Church on the Spilled Blood, and other important sites. Her information about Peterhof and its gardens and development was comprehensive and easy to understand. After visiting the amazing grounds with outstanding gardens and fountains we stopped at a typical Russian restaurant at which we had lunch. The borscht was very nostalgic as it tasted just like the one that my Russian grandmother made. Made me very happy. All in all a terrific experience and I highly recommend TJ Travel."
50,“Interesting city with canals and apartments abounding”,"Although best known for its art museum, the city is not to be missed. St. Petersburg was under seige for 900 days by the Germans in the Second World War. Much of it was destroyed and one million citizens died from starvation. Somehow, it has rebuilt to its former status as one of the world's great cities for the traveller. Constructed on marshland, there are many canals for drainage and the city is known as the ""Venice of the North"". We found photo opportunities everywhere. It is also a city of apartments. Our access was through a cruise, so accomodations were not considered in our view of the city."
50,“TJ Travel Custom Private Tour”,"TJ Travel provided our family a custom tour for four. Tatyana was very accommodating in helping us select our itinerary and building in additional time for the Hermitage. Our guide, Katya, and driver Igor, were very flexible in making unanticipated photo stops.The International Economic Forum was in progress during our visit resulting in blocked streets and traffic congestion. They quickly adapted alternative routes that kept us on schedule. We gave them a ""not-to-be-missed"" list for the Hermitage. Katya worked them into her normal Hermitage tour. She is very knowledgeable about the history and artistic significance of each exhibit.Beyond providing a wonderful two-day tour, Katya and Igor were friendly and provided insight into Russian culture. We visited local restaurants, a farmer's market, and shops. It is the ultimate tour for a value price."
50,“Like Venice in Russia!”,"St. Petersburg is a fantastic city filled with culture, history, style, fashion and plenty to do throughout the day and night. It is like visiting Venice (sits on the water with several smaller rivers running through the city) with beautiful architecture, great churches, world reknown museums, beautiful women, better food than you would expect, and a lot to do.Naturally, being Russia, it can get very cold in the winter so be sure to pack a coat, gloves, scarf and a hat if you go then. Among the best places to visit in St. Petersburg are the Hermitage, the Church of Spilled Blood, St. Issac's, Nevsky Prospect (good food and shopping), the Russian State Museum, Peterhof (an excellent outing), Peter and Paul Fortress, many palaces and much more!If you are planning a trip to Russia and not sure about how to allocate your time between Moscow and St. Petersburg, be sure to (1) go to Moscow first; and (2) spend more time in St. Petersburg than Moscow.The people may seem distracted or cold, but they are usually very private and not gregarious. Going out at night you'll want to look your best. The women are almost always dressed to the nines and look great. There is an entire culture underground where the street crossings take place (do not cross streets on the surface, look for and use the paths underground). Gold is big business in St. Petersburg but you'll find most things to be more expensive than in other cities."
50,“St Petersburg - Independent travel”,"We recently spent 2 full days in St Petersburg during a cruise of The Baltic, and before our departure decided to contact a Russian tour company, Alla tours, to arrange for us to see the city and its sights. We toured as a group of 6 with our own guide and driver and spent about 9 hours on each of the 2 days visiting various attractions including The Hermitage, the Peterhof, The Church on the Spilled Blood and the St P metro. The guide was excellent, nothing was too much trouble, and the organisation was all done over the net via the website alla-tour.com. I would recommend this to any first time visitor to St Petersburg and if we ever visit again, I would certainly contact them to see more of the sights there. They arrange the visas and the immigration procedure was extremely smooth. If you're going there, give them a try - you won't be disapointed."
50,“Take alla-tour to Saint Petersburg”,"If you are going to St Petersburg Russia, you will probably be on a cruise. It is a city full of wonderous sights and great people. But knowing how to get to all the sites can be overwhelming.. We recently spent two days in St Petersburg and had the time of our life, thanks to alla-tour. We visited the Hermitage, Peterhoff, Yusupov, Spilled Blood, Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Issac Square and Cathedral and much much more. All in an air conditioned18 passenger van with a great guide and driver.St Petersburg is a beautiful clean city and alla allowed us to enjoy its majestic quality"
50,“highlight of our Baltic Cruise”,"this was our 5th stop on our Princess cruise. Signed up for a 2 day land tour. This place is seething with history and grand places to visit. Went first to the Peterhauf. palace No pics allowed inside and covers required on shoes. The ornateness is beyond description. The gardens, grounds, and fountains are spectacular. The other spectacular place was the Hermitage, the largest art museum in the world. Full or paintings by legendary artists as well as the magnificence of the building itself. So many grand palaces and spectacular cathedrals, two days was not enough. Also saw Swan Lake at the ballet. Perfection. Once in a lifetime trip that you could easily repeat and not be disappointed."
50,“Beautiful - but would I go again?”,"We took easy way in - Cruise with Constellation to Baltic cities. Rain and cold weather is typical for May, and it was no exception. Churches and Palaces are beautiful, golden onion domed buildings are charming. We used Alla-tour, with a group of 20. It is least expensive and easy way to see the most famous places. Alla-Tour provided fantastic experience with very reasonable price.We were'nt aware that Russia won't let people off the ship unless we have Visa or hire government authorized company untill 3-4 months prior....and unfortunately some did not know till last minutes or waited too long for them to put the tour together. They ended up paying premium price for the tour.I notice big difference with those government workers. All European Passport Control workers are friendly, at least welcome people for visiting their country. Russian workers never spoke, never smiled or welcomed us!Russian goodies are very expensive - those intricate hand-painted boxes are in hundreds of dollars!Would I go again? Probably not - there are many other places as beautiful and able to walk around on my own!All and all, it is different - and it is worth going just to see once."
20,"“Thieves, miserable people, decay and neglect..St Petersburg-.never again!”","We should have been warned when we started the visa application process through the Russian Consulate in Sydney! Unhelpful, expensive and disinterested is how I would descirbe them. (Unlike Visa- link whom we eventually had to use).We have just had four days in St Petersburg and the cultural highlights were very good (although they are many cities that can rival them). However, just wander a few roads away from the the main tourist traps and the state of neglect of the buildings, the filthy,dusty inner courtyardsis nothing short of primitive! the people are sulky and morose- not a smile will crack these lips! but worst is the level of dishonesty: everyone is trying to scam the tourist- from hotels who take commissions on everything, to the thieves that freely roam the streets. We met an elderly man from Sydney whose money belt was 'removed"" and when he noticed- the young thugs gave him a beating. We had the camera lens stolen off our camera while in the queue for St Isaacs church and sadly the security officers and theofficers at the three police stations we went to were all unable to speak a word of English... only AFTER we told them of our problem. Tourists are vital to countryies economies and as soon as the inhabitants of these countries realise this, they can expect us to return- until then... Never again!"
50,“St. Petersburg - walk most everywhere”,"Very interesting city, full of history and art. Beautiful palaces,gardens, museums (Hermitage).No signs in English, but hotels provide good maps.Stay near the Hermitage and you will have a week of greatwalking to interesting sites - old soviet buildings, palaces,eateries (try Stolle - delicious Russian pies), Baroque architecture, etc.We had a guide for the 2 of us for mornings and part of theafternoons - we explored for the rest of the time on our own - itwas the time of White Nights so it never got dark.We studied Russian History a bit before we travelled, and hadan idea of what we wanted to see, so our guides geared our tourto that.To avoid long lines and waiting, arrange for a guide ahead oftime - they will whisk you through daunting lines to the sites, andthey know the best ways to go, and provide interesting comments."
50,“Russian Marvels”,"I paid approx. $220 for a ten and a half hour tour of St. Petersburg, when I was a passenger on MSC Opera cruises.Firstly, there is a lot of walking involved, if you need a wheelchair or can't manage stairs do not go on this tour. Russia is not disable freindly.We went out to Catherine the greats summer palace, absolutely stunning. There was one room covered in some type of an Onyx panels, we were told that room alone without the furniture or paintings was worth $142,000,000. Our guide was well versed in Russian history and kept us all enthralled with personal stories of the Tsars. You find out you need this ammount of time as the traffic is horrendous.From there we toured the Hermitage Museum (not to be missed) the revelation that Russian art seems to have superceded Europe was hard to comprehend.Another revelation, St.Petersburg is the Venice of the north, huge rivers and canals traverse the city. most of the buildings are works of art.I walked on the oldest square in Russia where Peter the Great walked in 1605, the church held the bodies of the Tsars, including the latest bones of the last Tsar family unearthed in a wood.Loved every minute and if I went back would pay the same again"
50,“A northern wonder”,"I have been in Saint Petersburrg for turism and I have also lived there for 3 months. I can only say that I am speechless as to how beautiful this city is.Starting with the cons, the city is cold, there's nothing you can do about it. Of course that is especially true if you go in the winter period, with temperatures reaching also -30° C. While this might be an issue, I do also believe that this city is beautiful in the winter. I have lived there for three months, from September to December, and despite the cold and the snow(neverending snow, may I add), the atmosphere was absolutly amazing. We were actually able to walk on the frozen river and witness some incredible scenaries that can only be seen in the winter time. The cold is strong, no doubt about that, but if you are just visiting as a turist, then it is also worth it to endure. Another issue one might have are the people. Russian people are only beginning to understand our western culture and world, they live in their own reality and are sometimes difficult to get trhough. That said, I have noticed that, though things are beginning to change, the language is still gonna be a problem. There are no English-written signs what so ever, nobody speaks English, let alone other languages.Though these may seem a whole lot of cons, the pros defently outweight the them. Simply the wonders one can admire could be enough. Depending on which country you come from, the lifestyle is pretty cheap (as far as one avoids the really touristic places of course) and, of course, Russian Girls. Among the great monuments and museums it is needless to say that the Hermitage deserves to be visited, along with the main attractions in the town: The Cathedral of the Saviour on the spilled blood, the astonishing St.Isaac Cathedral, The Peter and Paul fortress and everything around the city that you can spot as a landmark. The city itself is a whole grovel of littels channels but most importantly, the Neva, the main river crossing the city.The nightlife is great, but it's very difficult to get into clubs if you are a foreigner, aside from that, awesome nightlife, no doubt about it!A little outside the city are two other main attractions that one just can't miss, the Cathrine Palace and Peter the Great's palace. Both of them are extremly beautiful because of the architecture but also because of the amazing surrounding gardens. Unfortunatly I have only been in the city in the winter, so I can only imagine their beauty in the summer. However, I have enjoyed them greatly even in the winter time.Pictures can only do so much, so if you like these pictures, then you should defently visit the city."
50,"“St Petersburg, Russia- a beautiful city”","I have just returned from 4 days in St Petersburg, Russia. This is my third time in the city and it just gets better and better. I would rank it as good as Paris and Rome for beautiful buildings restored to the highest quality of renovation. The winter and summer palaces -the Hermitage, Peterhof and the Tsar's village have all been recently renovated in their 18th century decorative order. And they can all be visited by tourists. In the Hermitage, you can see a range of paintings by famous artists that is quite astonishing. Guided tour options abound as well as river trips and canal trips. The restaurants that we visited provided good quality -European and Russian cuisine- and represented good value for money-lower than London prices.Try the city, you will be amazed how good Russia can be and how friendly Russians can be. If you need a tour operator that can do tailor made tours at good prices with dedicated guides and drivers, you can do no better than Alla Tours."
40,“City of Tsars”,"At one time in the age of the Tsars and such, if you were ""anybody"" in the world you would have walked along Nevsky Prospect. Wonderful and lively street. St Pete is also home to the Hermitage and countless other fascinating museums. It is on the Baltic, so when a wind blows in it may not be necessarily strong, but it is briskly cold. It is also a predominantly military place, so military and history buffs will be highly pleased with their visit."
40,“St. Petersburg can be interesting even during winter!”,"My friend and I just returned from St. Petersburg where we stayed for five days/four nights at the end of March 2011. Although it was still snowing when we were there, we actually got the sun for many hours a day. The greatest advantage of visiting St. Petersburg during winter was that we didn't have to queue up for hours to get into places like the Hermitage Museum, Catherine's Palace, St. Peter and Paul's Fortress, the Church of the Spilt Blood, St. Isaac's Cathedral, etc!The collection at the Hermitage Museum is amazing, and apparently represents just a fraction of what's currently stored in the basement of the Museum (or somewhere safe). We spent almost four hours there, but that still didn't do it justice. If only we had more time... We would have loved to visit a couple more ""interest-driven"" attractions, too, such as the Cruiser Aurora Museum and the National Pushkin Museum. Perhaps next time. But we did make time for the Vodka Museum where we took a tour and did a round of Vodka tasting! Well worth it.We were lucky to have Mr. Gennadiy Chentsov, a private tour guide, taking care of us during our visit. He came highly recommended by a close friend who visited the city about five years ago.Gennadiy is a very experienced guide; he speaks perfect English and is knowledgeable about history and art. With his commentary, our visits to the palaces, museums, cathedrals et al suddenly came alive. He could answer pretty much any question on a variety of subjects. He is friendly and responsible; he is genuine, without overdoing it. He made all our visits extremely interesting and memorable. He even made arrangements for us to visit some ""off-the-beaten track"" spots - like the Smolny Institute for Noble Young Ladies - with significant historical value - he really put his heart to his work.I plan to visit St. Petersburg again, perhaps during the summer next time, largely because my experience with Gennadiy as our guide has been so positive. With a good tour guide, I believe there is so much to do and so very much more to explore in St. Petersburg that five days/four nights is simply too short a stay. Without a proper guide like Gennadiy, however, I probably wouldn't have sounded so keen about the city!"
50,“A wonderful city”,"This proved to be a great city break. Take strong shoes and be prepared to be amazed by the diversity of the city and by the sheer will of the people that have rebuilt it in recent times.By all means visit the well-known sites - the Hermitage, the Aurora, the Church of the Spilled Blood, but spare time for some more Russian attractions - the Museum of Political Life and the St Petersburg Museum were extremely interesting and we shed tears in both places for past residents of the city. Our favourite visit was an early morning one amidst the snow to the Nevsky Lara Monastery (Coffee 23p a cup and you get to see real Russians at prayer)Don't be put off by talk of gangs, pickpockets and danger to tourists - we walked about 55 miles in four days and felt no more threatened than in any city. Prices were comparable to London, with Businessmen lunches a good way to sample the food at a reasonable price.Leaving the airport could be a little frustrating - be patient through the three sets of security checks and you will return thinking this was a wonderful experience."
50,“So Much to See”,"This was my third trip in two years, and managed to see several places that I missed on previous trips. The first time I had been taken to the Peter & Paul Fortress, but didn't go inside the cathedral. This time I did, and it was well worth seeing - the decoration is magnificent. While in the grounds I was also shown the famous statue of Peter the Great - the one where he is sitting down, with a large body on which is placed a very small head!I spent one day going around a small area of the main street, Nevsky Prospect. I started with the Gostiny Dvor Arcade, which is an entire block of shops on the ground and upper floor - the shops vary from very exclusive (and expensive) to perfectly normal household shops, and even a beauty spar in the middle. I followed this up with a trip to the Kazan cathedral which is big! - Apparently not as big as St Isaac's half a mile away, which is huge, but it was nearly covered in icons. I finished up going around the Strogonov palace, which is a few hundred yards away in the Admiralty direction. The building contained some magnificent porcelain, produced a long time ago in a factory, but then given to friends --- it is what you can do if you have large estates and a lot of serfs! The building is beautifully restored, and there were even some pictures of ""before"" showing just how much work was required. I also managed to fit in a short trip around the political museum, looking at the rooms from where the revolution was originally run! Obviously there are other things in St Petersburg that should not be missed - The Hermitage, The Russian Museum (which is really an art gallery), and the Cathedral of the Spilt Blood should be on any list, and if you can afford it, a trip to the Mariinsky. Travel by Metro is fast and cheap (about 50p for as far as you want to go), and buses and trams are similar prices for the same deal. I have just come back, and it was very cold, about minus ten centigrade so river trips were not an option, but I have heard they are wonderful in the summer."
20,“Russia: I strictly don’t recommend - At least now.”,"I’m going to describe here my experience when travelling to Russia last month.Russia is becoming a more popular destination for tourists from all over the world since some years ago, so that’s the reason for this post; I feel in obligation to warn possible future tourists about some things.I organized a trip to Russia and Scandinavia through Dubai. The itinerary was: Moscow – Oslo (flight) – Stockholm (flight) – Helsinki (ferry) – St. Petersburg (train) – Moscow (train).Moscow and mainly St. Petersburg are really beautiful cities. St. Petersburg is, without any doubt, one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever been to. However, travelling to Russia was something really complicated and why not telling “traumatizing” in some ways.Above, I detail some problems I had:My bags were broken and things were stolen from inside the TWO times I departed from Moscow (Domodedovo airport – to Oslo and when coming back to Dubai), and it doesn’t only happened to my bag... there were at least 5 passengers from my flight at the Emirates Luggage counter at the airport (Dubai), all of them with bags without the zipper puller and lockers (yes, it doesn’t matter if you have a locker with universal key in your bag, they break the zipper, once it’s easier) and all bags were not properly closed. All passengers obviously checked their belongings right there in the airport when they saw their bags broken, and there were missing things in all cases. At my bag, there were perfumes, an external HD (ok, I shouldn’t have checked in that, anyway…) and a shirt missing. From a British woman, perfume, make ups, shoes. I didn’t wait longer to see what about the other passengers. Of course, there was also a lost with the bag itself. Emirates or any other company doesn’t have responsibility for things inside checked in bags, be aware of that.That happened at the airport when I was already coming back. Let me come back in time now, tell you a little bit about the day-by-day in Moscow and St. Petersburg:Just a very few people speak English in the streets (if it’s a person older than 40 y.o., this person don’t speak English at all). Signals or orientation in English are rare. Taking a subway, train or ask for information is something really difficult. English is spoken in hotels (of course), top restaurants (some), souvenirs stores, and that’s all. I travel a lot, I’ve been to the most hidden places in Southeast Asia for example, and even in those places I had never seen something like that. A simple “hello” or “thank you” is not spoken. Taking the train from St. Petersburg back to Moscow was a nightmare. No one could obviously give information at the train station because English was not spoken. The panel with trains and platform information was written in Russian only, I was “lucky” that my train was a bullet one, different from the normal ones, and I could identify it by running between platforms. Ticket was bought with the hotel concierge, so I knew the wagon and seats at least (to buy tickets at the train station is impossible if you don’t speak Russian – and tickets are written in Russian only).I’m always concerned about generalizations. However, I can tell without any guilt that Russian people at its biggest part is really rude, at least those ones living in Russia. They are no friendly at all, they don’t smile, they look at you in a terrible way, they don’t make a minimum effort to be nice with tourists, even with mimics (only way to communicate in most cases). They simply push you if you don’t walk fast like them, they don’t respect lines if they see you are a tourist in the line. A simple question we all make “do you speak English?” seems to be a big offense to them; many of them simply turned their backs on me after I asked that, and answered something in Russian which I bet wasn’t nice.Tourists are treated like possible suspect of something. In all stores there is a huge man who follows you wherever you go, or if he doesn’t do that, he keep looking at you. Even in hotels there are those men. That’s terrible; it’s a feeling of being a viable suspect of thief or terrorist every time, I don’t know.There are not taxis as we know in Russia (at least in Moscow or St. Petersburg). What exist are ordinary cars (some with identification, at its biggest part “Ladas” or really old cars) that simply stop and ask you if you need a (paid) ride… taximeters doesn’t exist; they charge you how much they want and you can accept or not. You must have a map of streets with destination clearly marked (English not spoken) every time you think about taxis, and if possible, a map with streets names written in Russian. Taxi Drivers are able to tell “four hundred” or prices they wanna charge you, so that’s ok to know how much you are going to pay at least.Russia is not as safe as the biggest part of Western Europe. Be careful where to go and when. Lots of dark streets in the nights, many drunk people in the streets.After the Domodedovo suicide attack, to departure from this airport (and I guess, from all other) became difficult. You pass through a first X-Ray at the main entrance, with all your luggage, there is a huge line. A rude man police officer touches you hardly (even if you are a woman – no female offices when I passed by). Until getting into the airplane, more 2 X-Rays will be in your way (talking about police: all police officers in Russia were really rude, and of course, didn’t speak any English – If you need police for anything, you are definitely lost).Well, in a few words, that’s it.If you really want to go to Russia, I recommend choosing St. Petersburg and skipping Moscow (more beautiful and less rude people).Don’t forget to carry everywhere an English or your language-Russian dictionary.I’m kinda against tourism packages or travelling with groups with a tour guide, but in Russia, I truly believe this is the best thing to do.To finish, I wanna make some things clear here, to avoid problems with people who might feel offended with this post: I am talking about my own experiences, about what happened to me in my trip, to what I saw. It doesn’t mean all tourists have or will have problems if travelling to Russia. Also, I didn’t tell at any moment that all Russians from all parts of the world are rude. What I told is that the biggest part of the Russians from the places I visited, in Russia, were. I don’t want to upset anybody here.I do understand that Russia had recently (yes, 20 years is recently) left a political system that isolated the country from the world in a way for a long time, and I know it can explain some problems they have now (language and rudeness). I know that, I don’t blame anybody. I’m just talking about my experience, hoping to help next travellers to Russia, and that’s all.Cheers!"
40,“A city with many beautiful palaces”,"St Petersburg and the immediate area contain many beautiful Cathedrals, palaces and places of interest. The Hermitage is the largest Art Gallery in the world, except for the Louvre, Peterhof has delightful fountains and gardens, and Catherine's Palace is alone worth the trip to this part of Russia.History is everywhere, from the tombs of the tsars in the Peter and Paul fortress, the significant locations of the Russian revolution, including Lenin's office and Kirov's flat and the monuments to the dead of the siege of Leningrad in the Second World War.If you are not travelling on a group visa you will require to obtain one of your own which can be expensive and the city itself can be difficult to get around, as the traffic is somewhat chaotic.It necessary to take precautions such as not drinking the water and you must be inoculated against certain diseases such as polio. However it is worth putting up with these small inconveniences in order to visit this marvellous city."
50,“Fantastic experience in a remarkable city”,"We took a Baltic Cruise on Holland America in June 2010. It was a wonderful cruise from London to Copenhagen, Tallin, St. Petersburg (2 nights), Helsinki and Stockholm. The highlight was a private tour we arranged in St. Petersburg through Anastasia Tours. Anastasia handled all the necessary documentation including visas. Our guide, Yulia was excellent. She was an art major who spoke English perfectly and was able to get us to the major attractions either before or after the crowds. We experienced St. Petersburg as if we were visiting with a relative. A truly unique city and a wonderful tour."
50,“my favorite tour guide”,"If you are looking for a knowledgable and reliable guide who is excellent in English I would highly reccommend Anna of I Travel SPBSandy, Minneapolis, MN"
50,“everything and more than I expected”,"on a cruise and knew we'd be hurried and harried but it was wonderful. used a private guide service called bestguides and they were fabulous. made suggestions and accommodated our interests. we tried to focus on russian things so in the hermitage we skipped alot of french and italian and flemish, but we've seen that elsewhere. wish we had skipped the gold room in the hermitage. absolutely loved the russian museum and the russian impressionists. church of the spilled blood is amazing. rode the hydrofoil to petershof and wandered the awesome gardens and skipped the main palace and visited montplaisir instead. perfect. loved catherine's palace in pushkin. of course we couldn't see everything or all of anything but it was a great city. would love to return if we could."
40,“Russian Winter Wonderland”,"It was gently snowing as we pulled into the St. Petersburg train station. We'd traveled to the city by train from Moscow, and from the start we were immediately surprised at how clean, beautiful and safe the city seemed, especially when compared to Russia's capital. We traveled by bus to a fancy hotel in the middle of town, and oohed and awwed over the many great historical statues, many of infamous Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin, and settled in for a fine night of sleep.In the morning we arose and toured a countless number of pastel-colored palaces and cathedrals. We saw World War II bullet holes still standing from the siege of St. Petersburg. We visited the Hermitage. The tours and the palaces were beautiful, surreal. Even more, however, was just the beauty and general atmosphere of St. Petersburg itself. Sitting on the shore and watching the boats go by was one of the most relax, beautiful and peaceful moments I have ever encountered.If Russia is your traveling destination, I highly recommend St. Petersburg. Be sure to purchase bottled water, for even the locals don't drink from the tap! Other than that inconvenience, it's a dream vacation."
50,“The best City in the world”,"St. Petersburg - is the northernmost metropolis in the world, and the second largest city in Russia. St. Petersburg was founded 05/16/1703 by Peter I, when after the victory over the army of the Swedish king decided to build on the Hare island fortress. With the XVIII to beginning of XX century, it was the capital of Russia.St. Petersburg is located on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and the east is Lake Ladoga, because this city was called ""Venice of the North."" The climate here is special, quite humid, with warm summers and moderately cold winters. Tourists often prefer to stay in St. Petersburg in the summer when it's time the White Nights. They are going from the middle of May until mid July.The main waterway of the city - the Neva River, which flows through the territory of St. Petersburg for 32 miles. Across the Neva, nowadays there are numerous bridges. The longest of them - the Alexander Nevsky Bridge. Its length is 909 meters. The most famous bridge - The Palace. Its silhouette is composed of two halves of the divorced, has long been a hallmark of this wonderful city. The oldest bridge of St. Petersburg - Anichkov. He is famed for its magnificent sculptural groups.However, this wonderful city is famous not only for its bridges and the white nights, is a set of unique attractions that are sure to be visited during the tour of St. Petersburg. Stroganov Palace, the Lutheran Church of St. Peter and Paul, the magnificent Cathedral of Kazan, ""Engelhardt's house, Church of St. Catherine, Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, Anichkov Palace, the area of the Rebellion, the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, Church of the Savior on Blood, Peter and Paul Fortress , Menshikov Palace, Peterhof, Tsarskoe Selo ...During the journey to St. Petersburg, be sure to visit the most famous landmark - the Winter Palace, which was built in 1754-1762. designed by the architect Rastrelli. It was conceived as the winter residence of Russian emperors. However, in 1837 the building caught fire and all the facilities were destroyed. Now here is the State Hermitage Museum with its unique exhibits of paintings, ancient monuments and the Scythian-Sarmatian antiquities.About Saint-Petersburg can talk forever, but it is better to see with my own eyes."
20,“Beware of pickpocket gangs”,"We have recently returned from a short stay in St Petersburg and must say how impressed we were with the place overall. Such a lot to see and do - far more than we could achieve in the 2 days that we were there. HOWEVER on the darker side, and whilst visiting the old battleship Aurora, I was the victim of a pickpocket gang and lost my cash and bank card. It was so cleverly done that I felt nothing, but on reviewing the incident can see how it was achieved. A girl got in front of me going up some steps on the ship and put her arms out on either rail and moved very slowly, preventing me from getting past her. This was obviously set up to give her accomplice the time to rifle my pocket. My wife became suspicious of all the pushing and shoving and called out for me to watch out for my wallet, but it was too late. Particularly galling was the fact that we had to watch the culprits scurry off to their four-wheel drive and get away. I was unable to take any police action as we were on a group visa and had to stay with the group and see out the remainder of the tour. The gang were obviously experts and before I could get my bank card stopped they had made four transactions from it. Just a warning then - never relax as I did and always be on your guard as I wasn't."
50,“Golden Paradise”,"St Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe! The canals are comparable to Venice and Amsterdam in beauty. The palaces are simply gorgeous with golden accents everywhere you look. In addition to the normal tourist attractions, don't overlook seeing Pavlosk and Oranienbaum for a special treat. The city is very safe and spotlessly clean. The people are gracious and friendly. Easily navigated on foot,but the Metro is fairly easy to get around as well. Plan on at least 3 days to see properly, if not 4. Must see's are :St Isaac's,The Hermitage,Peterhof, Catherine's Palace, Peter and Paul Fortress, The Church of the Spilled Blood. If time permits, catch the ballet at one of the spectacular theaters in town."
50,“my favorite itallian restaurant ITALY in St Petersburg”,"Beautiful city and friendly people! Excelent service at the restaurants, especially in new one of itallian restaurant called ITALY which is located on Bolshoy prospect 58 of Petrogradka. When we've been there we were amased by the great food served and outstanding view!!"
50,“Trans-Siberian-Train :”,"An epic journey from sophisticated St. Petersburg to Beijing via Ulaanbaator in Mongolia. The travel company I went with were excellent (Intrepid Travel), this is down to our fantastic guide, who accompanied us all the way. From visiting the famous Hermitage musiem to the formidable Kremlin in Moscow,sleeping in ""Yurts"" in Mongolia to walking the Great Wall and seeing the Terracotta Army in Xi'an in China.We had a mixture of travel modes from Trains to Minibus's to underground metros, boats and of course shanks's pony.The trip is for 21 days and was truly brilliant. Having only met my fellow travellers in ST. Petersburg we all got on well, due to the nature that we were all like minded travellers. Ages ran from early twenty's to late sixty's. The most interesting times were travelling on the numerous trains , longest journey (96hrs) and sleeping in Yurts in Mongolia.One of my most interesting adventures of travel I have ever been on, fantastic value for money, if you are a culture bug then this is for you.NBMake sure you bring a sink plug with you!!Alan"
10,“Could not wait to get out of Russia!”,"What a miserable city! I wish I could say otherwise - we went with bright eyes and naive souls hoping to learn more about the culture, see the sights, take in the history... what a shock once we arrived.Rude people cutting in lines, being glared at, not a single smile (except the fake ones from waiters or souvenir stands, until you say ""no thank you"" then you get cursed at) for several days, scary drivers, obvious criminals hanging about, mean street dogs...Aside from the Hermitage and various statues it was a very overpriced, overrated experience, not at all worth the dangers or discomforts. The food was wonderful but good Russian meals can be had in other countries. Tap water wasn't safe, police couldn't be trusted - why bother!!!"
40,“Wonderful Tour of City and Palaces”,I recently took a private tour with Marina Wilson and hercohort Natasha. I highly recommend the agency and woulddefinitely use them again if I return. Natasha was a art historymajor and was quite wonderful to visit the Hermitage with.The hotel which I stayed in was the Petro Palace which is centrallylocated and was a good value for the price paid. I do mentionthat the breakfast was highly overpriced and would not eat thereagain. There is a small grocery store located next to Petrowhich is very convenient. Definitely take the canal cruise evenif not in English.
50,“Local tour operator TJ Travel”,"We could see that TJ Travel fitted in more highlights than we'd see from our ship tours but were wary of reports of how late that ""independent"" travellers were allowed off the ship. No problem. Small group travel with fellow ship-passengers was a blast. My wife suffered back injury before leaving home and walking distances was a worry. TJ arranged for wheelchair for her to see the Hermitage as queues and standing were worrying us.TJ Travel were excellent and arranged a visit to the ballet (Swan Lake) US$100, 3 rows from the front. We;ve travelled from Antarctica to Damascus, this tour exceeded anything we've done before. Cannot recommend TJ Travel too highly. Be brave and do it, it's worth it."
50,"“The Guilded City of St. Petersburg, Russia”","A group of 14 of us enjoyed a 2 day tour of this incredibly beautiful city while on a cruise aboard the Star Princess. I had made private tour arrangements with Anastasia Tours and we were quite impressed with the professional and personal way we were treated. Our tour guide, Irina, was young, knowledgeable and very open and friendly with us and spoke perfect English. Her added insights of her personal experience made the tours so much more meaningful. We created a custom tour so that it would not be at a breakneck pace, and included a ride on the subway and a visit to the Farmers' Market. Both were very interesting and worth the time to take a look at local people and how they go about their day. We also saw Catherine's Palace with the Amber Room, the Gardens of Peterhof, the Hermitage, the Church of the Spilt Blood and St. Isaak's Cathedral. We had inexpensive, yet wonderful lunches without pre-booking. The first day at the cafe at Peterhoff and the second day at Stalle's Pie Shop. They offered just baked slices of various meat and vegetable strudels and choice of fruit or cheese dessert pies. Anstasia Tours treated us like visiting relatives, even providing fresh bottled water each day and pens and notebooks. Our only regret was that 2 days is not nearly enough to see what St. Petersburg offers."
50,“River cruise down the Volga to Moscow”,"Flew to St Petersburg with BA on a ten day holiday with VJV.com on a mosturflot vessel down the inland waterways to Moscow.The Hermitage was a great visit but we needed a lot more than 2 hours there they say that if you stand in front of every exhibit for 20 secs it will take 168 hours too see everything.The building was superb in its own right,but Catherine Palace at Puskin was a better Palace more ornate and a lot more gold leaf work especially the Amber room.We Left St Petersburg and sailed 288 km to Mandrogi a tourist village of old buildings and a place to part you from you roubles the vodka museum had only 2800 of the 5k vodkas in Russia but they were expensive at 450 roubles (15$ US) when in a supermarket or city vodka shop it was 90-200 roubles..Next stop Kizhi Island 276km a collection of old wooden buildings and it rained when we got there but it was very interesting visit.Next stop Goritsy 375km for a visit to the Monasrstary of St Cyril of the white lake.and it rained again not a lot to see the usual icons and painted walls.Next stop Yaroslavl 380km a town under repair getting ready for its 1k birthday and yet another visit to a monatary.same old icons and paintingsNext stop Uglich 209km to visit you guessed it another blo*dy monastary this one the Church of St Dimitri of the Blood the guide was a feminist and loved having a dig at the men in our group she was worth tipping 100 roubles just for entertaining my wife.Mocow next 264km cold and windy,red squre had scaffolding in it for a concert but St Basils was worth a photo or two and Lenins mausaleum was shut so it was off to GUM for a look at what we could`nt afford, coffee was 900 rbls a cup vodka was 200rbls 50ml.The Kremlin was worth a look around but the best place was the Armoury for a look at Faberge eggs and loads of gold plates etc.The metro is worth visiting at night we would have liked one more day in Moscow and dropped Yaroslavl.Moscow traffic is horrendous a quiet time is like LA/NY and London combined at rush hour, 30km to the airport can take between 2-10 hours.Voyage Jules Verne are a great company for cultural holidays."
50,“Visiting St. Petersburg with a wheelchair.....”,"St. Petersburg is not particularly wheelchair friendly so we sought the help of the RussianTourCompany.com for our two day visit.They not only obtained visitors' visas, entries to museums etc. but provided us with an official St. Petersburg guide, who spoke fluent English and certainly knew her way around this city. We had the use of a saloon car and driver for the duration of our stay. In fact our guide insisted on changing the saloon for a wheelchair accessible minibus for the second day, to make travelling even easier.I would highly recommend the RussianTourCompany.com to organise your visit to St. Petersburg to maximise the enjoyment and interest of visiting the city for a short time."
50,“Private guide St Petersburg”,"We have just returned from a cruise on the Queen Victoria to St Petersburg and we loved it. St Petersburg is the most amazing city but there is so much to see that you need a good guide to be sure to make the best of your time there. If you hate the idea of joining a group of 20 other people then you need a private guide.We were so lucky to find Gennadiy Chentsov who is efficient, professional and extremely knowledgeable. He is also a charming person who made our two days in St Petersburg interesting as well as fun. Gennadiy speaks excellent English and he impresssed us with his extensive knowledge of the turbulent history and the rich culture of his beloved St Petersburg - he knew the answer to every question we asked him!One of the complications of visiting St Petersburg is the need to apply for a visa. Gennadiy took care of all of the paperwork for the four of us which meant that we went straight through passport control with no problem at all and he met us at the dock with his private car to take us around.We only had two days in St Petersburg so we only scratched the surface of all there is to see there, but Gennadiy managed to fit in a great deal! He drove us around the city first so that we had an overview of the main buildings before we went to the Winter Palace to visit the Hermitage, and as Gennadiy had arranged for entrance tickets beforehand we did not have to stand in the long line waiting to get in. The palace is incredible and HUGE and Gennadiy knows it well so he was able to take us to the most important rooms so that in the limited time that we had we were able to see as much as possible.We also visited the the Peterhof Palace with its beautiful fountains and gardens, the Peter and Paul Fortress and Cathedral (and watched the daily midday cannon firing!) as well as St Isaac's Cathedral and the Church of the Spilt Blood - and the famous streetmarket in front where you buy the typical Russian dolls.If you have something in particular you want to visit Gennadiy will arrange it - we asked to visit the Underground train system (the subway) and that was really impressive with marble and bronze and statues everywhere. He also took us for lunch to a small and inexpensive Russian restaurant which we definitely would not have found on our own.If you want to contact Gennadiy he has a web page guide-petersburg.comHis prices include all the paperwork for the visas and the entrance prices for the various museums and is very reasonable. Gennadiy really is excellent and we shall definitely contact him when we go back to see the rest of St Petersburg."
50,"“Russia, beautiful St Petersburg”","We were on a cruise ship which had an overnight stay giving us ample time to see the sights and go to a theatre. We booked our shore excursion with DenRus who had been recommended to us by our travel agent. So glad we did, we were in a much smaller group than our fellow cruise passengers and seemed to jump the queue for all the important palaces and museums. The tour guide had an unending knowledge of the history and all our questions and more were fully answered. The 2 day tour started at 8 am and finished about 5.30 pm included a fine lunch and a comfortable air conditioned coach.Our evening was a trip to the ballet to see Swan Lake in a theatre that had once been a palace (where else)! All told an amazing city to visit and more than fulfilled out expectations."
30,“Independent travel to St. Petersburg”,"My wife and I just returned from a 3-day trip to St. Petersburg, and perhaps a summary of the way we did it might be helpful to others.We were planning to visit friends in Finland, and wanted to take advantage of the new provision whereby one can visit the city for up to 72 hours without a visa, if making the trip by cruise ship. This year a new ferry service has been established, it would seem specifically to take advantage of this, by St. Peter Line who run one ship , the Princess Maria, on a summer schedule from Helsinki which allows for arrival and departure within the 72-hour window.Due to what seemed to be a glitch with the booking engine on the St. Peter Line Web site, I ended up booking the trip through a Finnish travel agency, Matkapojat OY. They were extremely helpful (all communication in English), though the problem with the St. Peter Line booking turned out to be the fact that the ship had been chartered on the day we needed to return.After checking around, I got a flight from Rossiya Airlines, but this then meant we needed to get visas as we would not be taking the ferry for the return trip.For this, I turned for help to the tour guide company I had selected. My short list of tour guides/agencies had included Anastasia who at the time seemed to be the least expensive, Anna and Nina Fedorova who were roughly comparable, and Marina Wilson who was slightly more expensive. But in the end we chose Marina, in part because the fact that she listed her licence number on her site made my wife feel more secure, and in part because she simply responded to queries much faster.She rose to the challenge, and immediately arranged for the hotel she had recommended to issue the requisite tourist vouchers, which I needed to include with our applications to the Russian consulate here in order to get the visas. Despite an impossible deadline, all worked out, and we made the trip.Ratings: the Princess Maria is an older ship, purchased from the Finnish Silja Line, and though it shows its age a bit, it was clean and generally in good repair. We did not take advantage of the sumptuous buffets offered for dinner and breakfast, and found the only alternative to be a small cafe with rather poor offerings. Otherwise, the Russian owners seem to be making every effort to keep a high standard, and the mostly Finnish tourist clientele seemed content. A bar with strippers at late hours has recently been introduced, and that may change the nature of the clientele with time-- especially as the ship will also be used on separate dates for party excursions for the wealthy Russian club set.We stayed at Comfort Hotel which was very well situated close to Nevsky Prospekt and the Hermitage, and reasonably priced compared to others in the area. The staff was helpful and efficient with the visa papers and our booking, and they were just as helpful in person. The room was average size, clean and well furnished, though I found the coarse-grade and slightly-stained carpet a bit below standard. The breakfast was just adequate, with minimal choices. The physical arrangement is unusual, with each floor of the hotel opening off to one side of a public stairwell, and can cause confusion for travelers arriving, as the reception is on the second floor with no clear signage indicating this.Our guide service, Marina Wilson Tours, worked out very well for us. In addition to helping set up the visa voucher on short notice, Marina was patient and flexible in working out an itinerary to suit our interests, and in the end even threw in one museum visit gratis in order to meet our budget. She responded to all communications promptly, which set her apart from the others we contacted. We were lucky enough to have Marina herself as our guide all three days, and she was personable, knowledgeable and generous with her time throughout.Travelling for the first time on Rossiya Airlines was a pleasant surprise. Unlike Aeroflot, they had top-notch equipment and service, and the fact that Finnair has chosen to partner with them on some flights speaks well for their standards. I got a Web-only price which was less than a third of the regular fare on that flight."
20,“Somewhat Short of Expectations in St. Petersburg”,"We had relatively high expectations for St. Petersburg because it is a city with history and the cultural capital of Russia.Visually it is an interesting city layout because it was patterned after Amsterdam with its many canals and bridges. The city centre shows many interesting examples of painted buildings and grand structures, but on closer inspection, it is also a city in need of constant repair.There are many attractions to see. Catherine's palace is a popular sight with its sprawling rooms and grounds. Note that many Palace artifacts were lost during the war so you are looking mostly at the building's restored art.Another attraction is the famous Church of the Savoiur on the Spilled Blood after the spot where Alexander II was assassinated.The most anticipated attraction for me was the Hermitage museum. The Hermitage has been said to be one of the five greatest museums in the world by collection (over 3 million items - not all on display) including works by Rembrandt and Michelangelo etc. and one of the largest by available floor space. The crushing crowds did not shock me too much but, what suprised me was, unlike some other museums, the Hermitage is not climate controlled at all. Although plus 30 celcius heat made the visit very uncomfortable, I also wondered how the temperatures and light effected the longevity of the art work.Overall, it might be best to plan to be on a tour in Russia to help guide you around. You do need a visa to visit or you must be registered to a tour excursion if you come via other means such a cruise ship to set foot in Russia. Besides the restrictions, the city attractions are quite spread out.In terms of souvenirs, the most popular items appear to be the wooden nesting dolls (hint the plain looking ones are the authentic designs), faberge eggs and amber.St. Petersburg is worth a visit, but be prepared for the heat and crowds in the summer months."
50,“ST PETERSBURG”,We recently returned from a Princess cruise and opted to take an Alla Tour. The best decision we made. Helen was our tour guide and she was very informed. We just loved the tour and spoke to people that took the Princess tour which was more costly. They said they were unable to enter the Hermitage and other places that Alla Tours took us into. This was a wonderful experience for me and my friends.
50,“Jewel in Russia”,"Are you in Russia? or you definitely feel you are in some part of Europe? You find the whole city/town is demmonstrating the every single way of showing how it's capable to show the atomosphare of the aspects of culture in Europe.You can spend a day in Hermitage just to enjoy the arts collection, you can visit many cultural spots around the city, you walk down on the pavement by the river with beautiful day and night, or you can even go to the suburb to see the life of summer in Russia for the imperial families.I can find the word, one and only, to describe this ancient capital which is ""Gorgeous"" in a good way! You always have something that you would like to do no matter how lond you'd stay in this very unique town of Saint Petersburgh."
50,“A breathtakingly beautiful city”,"We had two days in St Petersburg, Russia as part of a Baltic cruise in June 2010. We did quite a bit of research before we left and after looking at what we could get through our ship, decided to go with a local operator - SPB Tours. I knew basically what we wanted to go and see - all the normal tourist sights, but having a 4yr old with us meant that we needed to be flexible and prompt when going through the museums (so he didn't melt down!).The tour operator owner (Viktoria) met us at the cruise terminal, along with our driver (Boris) and guide (Paulina) and had even bought a brand new child carseat for our son to keep him safe. This was the start of two magical days that went beyond our expectations.There isn't any point in going into each sight.... this post would end out to be as big as ""War & Peace"". Needless to say, you need to do everything you possibly can. All the churches (we went into the Church of the Spilled Blood, the Peter & Paul Fortress & St Isaacs) are completely different and just amazingly beautiful for their depth, colour, history, and uniqueness. Even my husband (who hates churches!) was blown away by the sheer size of them and the detail that is inside each one. One of the biggest surprises was the subway. They are all made of beautiful cream marble and granite. We have done a seriously large amount of travelling over the years and we have never seen anything so clean and beautiful. It is worth the detour into a subway to just see the beautiful mosiacs, chandallers and marble pillers as you climb about the stereo-typical rickety old subway trains!Inside the Catherines Palace and the grounds at Peterhof are just incredibly beautiful. Not only for the physical size of everything there (and the amount of gold!) but just the pristine nature of how things are kept. Take the time to walk around the grounds and just enjoy the location. It is breathtaking.The Hermitage Museum is worth every minute you spend there. We were frightened that our son would get bored quickly so we only spent three or four hours there and moved through each room at a steady pace (having pre-chosen what we wanted to see). We were told that if you stopped and looked at every piece within the Hermitage, you would be there for seven years so be prepared to keep moving!! It is definatley worth the time and effort though. The place is amazing.The only downside to the whole city that we found were the state of the toilets in public spaces. We seriously didnt find one toilet that was anywhere near being hygenic so our advice is to either hold on, take toilet seat covers or wipes and practice holding your breath!!!!Having travelled a substantial amount of western Europe, the Med, Britain and the east cost of both Canada and the US, we can quite honestly say that St Petersburg is one - if not the most beauitful cities in the world. I would put the depth of history and number of beautiful sights almost above that you can get in Rome, London or Paris - and the people are so proud of the historical path they have taken and their journey so far. It is a city of surprises, enough beauty to make you cry and friendly people. Not once did we feel unsafe, not once did we regret the money and time spent there.Spend the time. Spend the money. Get a local guide and see this city properly. I can promise you that you will not be disappointed."
50,“a great port of call for 3 days”,"we sailed with Regent on the voyager for a cruise of the baltic. we had 3 days in st. Petersburg with 2 to 3 excursions each day. the must-see attractions are the palaces of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great and the Hermitage.going by boat made it effortless for us as they arranged the Russian visa and had experienced, local guides for all excersions."
50,“T J TRAVEL”,We have just returned from a Baltic Cruise (Queen Victoria)We were a group of 6 15/16 July 2010 and I cannot recommend this Tour company enough.Olga was our tour guide - she was waiting for us at immigration with th Driver ...The Mercedes transport was very clean with aircon - there was even bottled water for us.We did the Active tour and Olga certainly made sure we saw everything without the hastle of having to queue.We even had lunch at a Russian Pie Shop....something that you will not do on a cruise boat tour.On speaking to other passengers - we certainly did and saw a lot more of St Petersburg than they did at a much better price...So in all we had a fantastic Tour with an Excellent Guide and Driver at a very reasonable cost.
50,“TJ Travel in Russia”,"We just back from St. Petersburg, Russia which was one of the most beautiful places we have seen in our many travels. We were on the Holland America but used TJ Travel in Russia. They were outstanding..We had Olga H and she spoke perfect english. We had 8 in our party in a private car, no lines, perfect itenerary. Just can't say enough nice things about both, TJ and Russia....Pat"
50,“Red October Tour Company - Fab”,"Just returned from a 7 day Baltic cruise which included one day in St Petersburg. Rather than joining one of the large tours organised by the cruise company we pre-booked a tour with Red October - a locally based tour company, it was fantastic, and they take care of all the visa regulations etc. There were just the 3 of us on the tour, my partner, 14 year old daughter and myself, we had a guide and a driver with an air conditioned taxi and free water. When booking the tour we arranged with Red October what we would like to do and see this included; visit to a food market, ride on the metro, lunch in local cafe, visit to a department store, as well as taking in some of the major sites like the Hermitage. I would thoroughly recommend anyone travelling to St Petersburg to use this company, they are no more expensive than the tours offered by the cruise company's and the tour can be tailor made to suit your interests."
50,“Excellent tour in St. Petersburg”,"During our cruise in May 2010 we arranged a 2-day trip with Tatyana of TJ Travel in St. Petersburg. We had an excellent 2-day tour through St. Petersburg with our tour guide Nellie, who was very knowledgeable about the history of St. Petersburg. We were a group of 6 people and Victor, the driver of the comfortable car/bus, was very helpful with a wheel chair, needed for one of us. We went to the Hermitage, Peter Hof, Catherine's palace and since Victor knew St. Petersburg very well, we were hardly in a traffic jam. Our guide Nellie spoke excellent English and we enjoyed listening to her. For more info on TJ travel, go to www.travel-st.petersburg.com, tel. 29219532378 (Tatyana)"
50,“Saint-Petersburg - Nortern Venice”,"Everybody must be here. Absolutely fantastic, the best City in the world, perfect views. Fantastic walks, channels, rivers, buildings, bridges, white nights in the summer. I don`t know how many enthusiastic words I can say about it! You need spend here not less than 5 days to look all Russian Empire born city attractions. You must visit Hermitage, Peter`s and Paul Fortress, Saint-Isaac Cathedral, Peterhoff, Pushkin and use water tours. And you must see white nights with opened bridges (be careful, if you stand on the one coast of the river in the night, you can get to another one only in the morning). Here is even more Sights and museums than in Roma, Paris, London in the St-Petersburg! And forgot about guides, just walk, its much more interesting and you`ll get more freedom to look all you can."
50,“Two days in a wonderful City St. Petersburg is woth the time.”,"Just came back from a cruise on Holland America Eurodam. The highlight of the Cruise was two Days in St. Petersburg. We Booked out Two Day Tour with TJ Tour and they provided an excellent Guide, whose sole purpose was to get every Palace and important Landmark covered in just two days. Our Guide Julia spoke excellent English and she provided Expert Historical facts and a good sense of Humour. One more point to make about taking the excursion from a Cruise Ship. St. Petersburg has invested substantial money on the infrastructure and clearing customs was made much easier with each Cruise Terminal having its own Customs hall. The city is full of wonderful historical Palaces and revolution significant landmarks.Here are the Highlights that we did:PeterHofSt Isaacs Cathedral\Catherines PlaceHermatageChurch of Our Savior on Spilt BloodHermitage MuseumMetro RideHydroFoil RideYusopov PalaceThe great thing about this tour was that everything was timedand we in a small group were able to dictate how long or how much of a particular site we wanted to take in.So my advice in closing is go to St Petersburg and find a good tour company. If you do you will see all the important sites in a two day time period."
40,“Stayed 3 days..here are our thoughts”,"As you need a Visa before you arrive, no-one older than 25 years speaks English and signs are all in Russian, you need to expect a trip here to be a bit harder work than normal. It's worth it though. We stayed at basic hotel (Northern Lights) about 2 mins walk from beautiful St Isaacs Cathedral. Staff were fantastic as was the restaurant over the road. Most tourist sights are within 15 minute walk from hotel. We took 90 minute double decker bus on first day to get the lie of the land. Very good idea, but red hop on/off bus stops hard to find. Suggest you get on at REAR of Church of the Saviour of Split Blood, or the large plaza 100 metres in front of St Isaacs Cathedral. Bus comes every 30 mins.Took Metro and bus to Peterhof (St.P version of Versailles) and came back on ferry but in hindsight would have been better to pay a little more and take one of the daily guided tours (11am) from outside railway station on Nevsky Prospect. Winter Palace and Hermitage museum were awesome but huge (good advise from lonely planet and local guide as to which areas to go to, and expect to queue for an hour to get in). If you find a reasonably well priced Hotel with a swimming pool, suggest you take it...it's HOT and humid here in July. Try and avoid taxis (will rip you off and you can't argue with them), carry a photocopy of your passport at all times in case the police stop you (they didn't stop us but apparently it's common if you attract their attention for whatever reason), and keep your purse/wallet stuffed at the bottom of your backpack/handbag. Pick pockets are common in busy tourist areas. However, we felt safe, people were friendly, enjoyed the city and sights, food and local beer were good, oh yes, DON'T drink ANY tap water. Bottled water only, even for brushing your teeth."
50,“Travel All Russia”,"I found the company ""Travel All Russia"" on the internet. I could not find any comments to help me decide to use them. We finally booked hotels in St. Petersburg and Moscow, a train trip and a cruise on the Volga through this company. Service was excellent. They took care of our Visas and helped us pay for hotels and drivers. They had people in both towns to help us incase of emergency. We were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary. One of our gifts was the service at Travel All Russia. B. J. Ellersieck"
50,"“T J Travel Services in St. Petersburg, Russia”","On a recent river cruise from Moscow to St. Petersburg, we hired the services of TJ Travel on our free day in St. Petersburg. We were picked up at our ship. The van provided for 6 of us was very comfortable, the driver courteous and the tour guide excellent.Her command of the English language was very good and her knowledge of the areas we toured was excellent. We spent the entire day with her and saw and visited so many different sights. We probably did in one day what it would have taken others to do three days. We highly recommend the services of TJ Travel. Everything was arranged on the internet and payment was not requested until the end of the tour."
50,“Alla Tours”,"Alla tours - 2 day complete St. Petersburg tour - June 2010.Highly recommended !Efficient organisation from Alla office.No problems getting off cruise-liner (Ocean Countess) & through immigration.Superb service from our guide, Julia.Could not fault !!"
50,“A stop on our river cruise- St Petersburg- now our favourite city in the world”,"We just finished a river cruise with Viking River Cruises from Moscow to St. Petersburg. Moscow was interesting, and lots of hustle and bustle, but St. Petersburg was spectacular! Why more people do not visit this city is maybe because of the need to have a visa for Russia, but let me tell you: it is well worth it.It is a visual treat, archictecture that tops the best of any other city we have been to, museums that are not only the most extensive in their collections, but housed in palaces that actually were homes to the royal families. We could have been as fascinated looking simply at the floors, doors and ceilings, as at the walls for the artwork! The Hermitage and the Russian Museum were of course highlights!The people are quite western, and charming. We talked to many youngsters who were very well educated, and clearly driven. Many working several jobs.We were lucky to stay in the comforts of our river cruise ship, the Viking Kirov, so we cannot comment on the hotels, though we stopped into two very comfortable historical hotels. Mind you, for the price of four nights in a hotel in St Petersburg, we had a 12 day cruise along the Volga river from Moscow through the beaufiful Golden Ring towns and villages, with all our food, excursions, and entertainment included! Russia is on the whole a fascinating place. If you have a chance: GO! Anna (London)"
30,"“Amazing artistic inheritage, unfriendly people”","St. Petersburg was an overwhelming experience for me.I happen to be an Art Historian, so having the chance to visit such place and it's incredible artistic treasures couldn't ever be bad. However, the people there can spoil the experience.They look horribly sad and resented, they don't know how to treat a costumer and, in fact, I noticed that they barely know how to work. Comunism must have had a corrosive effect on it's people's creativity and joy of life. I feel really sorry for them.The treasures you will see there are all from the Czarian past and they are abundant!Must dos:Hermitage Museum (Da Vinci and the italian Renaissance, Maneirism and Barroc, Impressionism section (mostly stolen from the Jews and not given back), The peacock clock (must see!!!).Caterine's PalacePeterhof PalaceSpilled Blood ortodox churchSt. Isac church (the most amazing mosaics!)National Arts Museum (Russian avantgard)Subway station (ask where the best spot is)The soviet architecture is sad and depressing, very emblematic and persuasive though.The experience in Russia is very strong, mainly for a western person like myself, but make sure you book a tour or be with a local, otherwise the experience may not be so sweet.Unfriendly and non speaking English people not making any effort to be helpful or to understand you.Details:Arts over there are not very well taken care of, mainly in the Hermitage. Bad illumination, people using flash all time with no reprehension, paintings bending to one side...very disappoining. But still the collection is incredible!Careful everywhere with pickpockets;The city is clean and beautiful;EVERYBODY cuts lines, if you don't enter the game you might not be able to see any attraction.All atractions are very disorganized, so have in mind that you will take longer than you expected in each of them.Its all expensive over there but students with the card pay half price. (attractiosn can vary from U$ 10,00 to U$ 20,00.)Pancakes there should be a good option for food.Don't forget: Always be with a local or a group. Russians are REALLY not prepared for wellcoming unassisted tourists, unless you are an adventurer and don't mind an ""exotic""treatment."
50,“Outstanding!”,We just came back(June 2010) from a cruise on the Oceania through the Baltics. We booked a tour separate from the ship with Alla-tours. They sent us everything we needed to get off the boat and we had no problem. Our tour guide Elena Farmakovskaya was excellent. She spoke perfect English and knows her history as she is a professor of Russian history at the University. She brought us to everything we should see plus more. Our lunches were excellent. We never had to wait on line.She wasted none of our time. We had three full days with her and it was priced far less than the boat and well worth it! Highly recommended without reservation.
50,“Russian Tours - 2 days in St. Petersburg”,"We recently booked a 2 day tour of St. Petersburg through Russian Tours. This was extremely well organised and interesting as we were taken to see the inside of churches which cruise ship tours only saw the outside (e.g. The Church of Spilled Blood). Olga, our guide, spoke excellent English and was extremely knowledgeable. We were a small party of my wife and myself, Olga and her driver, and were able to fast track past larger groups at The Hermitage and Peterhof Palace. The first day also included lunch and we were able to experience typical Russian fare. The second day included a visit to Peterhof Palace and gardens and a food hall in St. Petersburg. I would recommend this company to anyone visiting St. Petersburg as it is good value and very efficiently organised.David Rich"
50,“Alla Tours-St Petersburg”,"On a Baltic cruise to St Petersburg we pre booked on the internet a 2 day private tour with Alla Tours for 4 persons with small Mercedes bus driver and guide. It was not cheap but we were provided with an excellent guide Dina who was brilliant, perfect English and outstanding knowledge of all the sites visited. The schedule was well organised and over the 2 days saw all the major sites including a trip on the metro and learnt about history and modern day life in St Petersberg. Its a fantastic place."
50,"“Peter, the Great - The most Wonderful place in the world!!”","St Petersburg, the Capital of Imperial Russia is sure to offer the most wonderful experience to any visitor - filled with cultural, sporting, religious and historical vistas perhaps unmatched by any other place in the world. The city is located on the delta of River Neva at 60 degrees North offering a fantastic range of seasons and unusual weather, including white nights in summer when the sun sets just for a few hours, and bleak winters. The must see include opulant Palaces (Winter Palace, Yusupov's, Sheremetyev's and Strogonoff's), Cathedrals (St Isaacs, Church of Resurrection, Peter and Paul Cathedral, Nikolai's), Museum (Hermitage, Russian Museum, Kunstkamera, Naval museum, Artillery museum), Opera and Ballets (Marinski, Alexandrenski, Oktyaberski). The suburbs of Pushkin, Pavlovsk, Gatchina, Peterhof, Staraya Ladoga, Lomonosov and Shlisselburg are outstanding Palace-Park complexes. Veliky Novgorod, Vyborg and Ivangorod, all located within 200 km from Peter are great weekend visits filled with historic value. The large Russian outdoors offer enormous scope for skiing, sailing, ice hockey and generally walking around the great city. Language would be a great barrier as English is poorly understood in most places."
50,“Viking River Cruise”,"Take the Viking River Cruise from St. Petersburg to Moscow (on one of their newly renovated ships) and see Russia at its best. The cruise line is superb and the itinerary is great - lots of river cruising time, shoe excursions, lectures and activities on board the ship, great food and excellent crew. All in all, a wonderful way to experience Russia and have a relaxing and educational vacation."
40,“So huge it'll blow up your mind”,"The city of St Petersburg is relaxed. There is some room to breath. Lots of things too see and try. If you have a limited amount of time to spare, i suggest you'll check the church ""On our saviors blood"", and nearby the Russian museum. If you still want to see the works of most great western artists go to Heremitage. I wanted to see something Russian and was pleased with the Russian Museum."
50,"“ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA private tour company”","We just returned from the Princess 10 day Baltic cruise which included St. Petersburg, Russia. We used TJ TRAVEL as our private tour company instead of the ship's excursion. I would like to say they did an amazing job of showing us and teaching us about their history and culture. We spent two full days touring and included a boat ride through the canals at night. Our guide, Katianna, had excellent English and had an excellent command of all the facts. There were 14 in our group, and we were very comfortable in their Mercedes bus. We all came away with wonderful memories of our visit to St. Petersburg, Russia. Using a private company was less expensive and much more meaningful than going with a large bus load."
50,“St Petersburg is a Winner with Katya”,"We had a most enjoyable and enlightening visit to St Petersburg this past March. The city and its history was fascinating. Our hotel accommodations were superb( Grand Europa). However, our guide for three days, Ekaterina Makarova made the trip. Her English was excellent as was her knowledge of the city and its history. In addition her personality made every day enjoyable and fun. We cannot recommend Katya highly enough if one is visiting St Perersburg as she is a delight and made our trip special."
20,“Ferry from Helsinki to St Petersburg”,"I travelled recently on the new ferry service form Helsinki to St Petersburg. The ferry is an old (1981) boat that is now operating under the Maltese flag with a mixed Estonian/Lithuanian crew. Boarding and check-in at Helsinki were poor, and it was equally slow and disorganized at the St Petersburg end on the return trip. The cabin that I was given had not been cleaned and all 4 beds were unmade. I was moved to a new cabin on deck 4 although this cabin smelt badly. I heard other passengers at the reception with similar complaints. Food onboard was poor and overpriced and omboard atmosphere was poor. Given a choice between this old, poor ferry or a train/bus then I would choose another option if possible. Standards onboard this ferry are FAR below similar Scandiavian operated boats."
40,“Girly getaway in pretty St Petersburg”,"I went to St Petersburg, Russia, a couple of weeks ago with some girlfriends and although the city was coming out of a big freeze, we had a great time sightseeing with no attractions affected by the weather conditions.Overall I would recommend St Petersburg as a great short break destination - the architectural landscape is as brilliant as you would dream about (St Isaac's, Church of the Spilled Blood were personal highlights) - and the locals were surprisingly friendly. Expect to drink lots of vodka and eat plenty of delicious Georgian food.The only issue we had was at the airport on return. I had been warned by friends who had visited St Petersburg a couple of years ago to get to the airport early as they had experienced utter chaos because of the strict security screenings, but oh my god! This was ridiculous. We waited for an hour from the entrance of the airport to the start of the screening process and people were pushing and shoving their way through - definitely no British queuing system here! We allowed 3 hours to check-in and had no time to spare to buy last minute duty free goods.We stayed at the Radisson on Nevsky Prospect which was great. Service was exceptional and the room was cosy but comfortable."
50,“Tickets for Ballet in St Petersburg”,"We are travelling to St Petersburg in April and wish to see a ballet at the Marinsky Theatre.We have bought tickets in advance directly from the Theatre paying around £80 for the very best seats, on other web sites tickets were more than double the price for lesser seats. Make sure when booking you do so direct with the Theatres, as £100 over the top per person is scandalous!"
20,“Why Russia?”,"I don't know why Russia, went with my hubby and 2 children, i've heard before I went that the people there are stern!!! Understatement. But that would not put me off. Learn a bit of the lingo and it will help you.. I did, in fact I bought a translator to help me. To know avail, We were not once made feel welcome not in any restaurant and we went into some expensive eateries, except for Pizza hut and Mc donalds the cheapest restaurant were the most welcoming. In the end we played a game between ourselves as to who could get one of the locals to smilefor us... it was a draw, not a smile to be had. Nevertheless we battled on, the staff in shops were so rude it was too funny. So all in all I did not spend a lot, to my husbands delight as I would not part with it when the staff literally turned their backs on us when they saw us enter their store it was a very soreal experience. I would never again return to Russia they are so unfriendly and unwelcoming the world is too big to be putting up with that."
40,“A great first stop in Russia..”,"I think St. Petersburg is a great introduction/first stop for anybody visiting Russia.My friends and I weren't really sure what to expect of the city, or for that matter, the country. St. Petersburg ended up being a pleasant, quiet surprise and a wonderful starting out point.If you arrive via airplane at the airport, be prepared for a potential wait at customs. We arrived, it seemed, with most other western airlines so many of us ended up in customs at once. Processing time was on the slow side, but I think that was based solely on the volume of people. Once I made it to the customs officer, I was processed quickly (and silently!) into the country.If you are interested in taking public transit into the city, it is fairly simple. Just catch the bus outside (#13) to the metro stop. If you are uncertain which bus to take, or which stop to get off at - simply follow the crowds with the suitcases. And - you pay on the way out!The metro itself is quite enjoyable. My friends and I got laughs out of how quickly and curtly the subway doors closed (or slammed shut). Take caution of the scale of the subway map - the trains appeared to travel quite quickly and there was a fair distance between stops. Having travelled to Moscow as well, I think St. Petersburg's metro stations are also quite nice to look at but they really are the baby brothers to Moscow's amazing stations.On the surface, the layout of the center city is fairly easy to understand if you can remember where the canals are. Most attractions are located near the main canal and are almost all within walking distance to each other. We spent an entire day sightseeing and managed to see most things simply by walking around the city, though I will admit we didn't spend much time at any of the sights. Just enough time to take some pictures, read about some history in the guide books and move on. We did not pay to go inside anything.One note for anyone that wants to visit the Hermitage museum - it is closed on Mondays. This was the day we planned to visit and I am extremely disappointed we did not get a chance to go inside.Once the sun sets, the waterways illuminate and the city becomes enchanting. I found the lit up buildings along the main canal to be absolutely stunning.Foodwise, we ate at cafes most of the time and I always enjoyed my meals. It was quite a change from the North American large portions - most food was a bowl of soup and a slice of meat pie. I never felt full, but never hungry either. One meatpie shop I would recommend is Stolle - with locations around the city.I felt fairly safe in St. Petersburg, even at night. While I was always aware of my belongings (especially my wallet), I never felt threatened.One thing I was surprised about (though was a theme in Russia) was the lack of English spoken or understood. I figured for a city so close to Europe and one that receives cruise ships from all over, English would have been a bit more widely accepted. Not a problem however - we enjoyed trying to communicate with the locals through our *very* minimal Russian and their likewise comprehension of English.This city really has European influences and it is quite pretty to look at. It is quite contrasting to Moscow, but retains many Soviet principals. Overall - a great first stop in the country. Enjoy!"
40,“2 Whirlwind Days in St. Petersburg”,"Saint Petersburg in two days. Impossible you say, well almost but not quite. One of the tough hurdles to overcome for visiting St. Petersburg is the visa. It can be hard to obtain the visa unless you plan far in advance, or take advantage of a cruise package with group visas. We did the latter, and had two whirlwind days of touring the highlights of the city and region. Going back to the visa situation, if you choose to go on your own you will need an invitaion of entry and confirmed hotel reservations. Basically you need to prearrange a tour package to keep things simple. Once there, you'll quickly find that you'll be happy to have someone else do all of the driving and negotiating. Our tour consisted of two days from 7:30a.m. until 4:30p.m. both days.Day 1: We visited the Summer Palace or Catherine's Palace. The restoration work was very nearly finished as of June 2009. It was an amazing place. Unfortuneately we only had a couple of hours to tour the palace and the gardens. We paused for a lunch break of traditional Russian food and then spent the next two hours visiting the Peterhof Gardens. Another incredible experience. Two hours does not do it justice though. There are approximately 120 fountains in the gardens and we only viewed the highlights of them. We did not get a chance to go in the palace itself. After the Peterhof experience we spent the next hour or so getting back into the downtown area. We took half an hour for souvenirs and pictures in front of St. Isaac's Cathedral. Later that evening we took in a cultural show that was very entertaining. We returned to the Cruise Terminal at 11:00p.m. and the sun was still up, another late spring event in St. Petersburg, the white nights.Day 2: We focussed on downtown St. Petersburg sites and attractions. A visit to the Peter and Paul Fortress, the final resting place for many of the Romanov Tsars. We enjoyed a river/canal cruise around the city, seeing things from a different perspective. There were photo opportunities at the Rostrum Columns and the battleship ""Aurora"". A quick stop at the Palace Square and the Alexander Column for more pictures. Then we went to the Church of Our Savior On Spilled Blood and then lunch at a local resteraunt. After lunch we headed over to the Winter Palace or Hermitage and had all of two hours to try and absorb as much as we could. It was like trying to vist the Louvre during your coffee break.After all was said and done, we thouroughly enjoyed our 2 day visit to St. Petersburg. I didn't mention earlier, but we also subjected our 6 year old son and 4 year old daughter to the whirlwind experience. Believe it or not they had fun as well and even held up better than some of the other people on our tour.If there is any chance of seeing St. Petersburg, I recommend putting on some comfortable walking shoes and taking advantage of it."
50,“Parallel 60 is outstanding for tours of St Petersburg!”,"We spent 3 very exciting and interesting days in Russia last week, and especially wanted to commend parallel 60 tours for making our visit so easy and educational. Alexandra was the perfect guide--she helped us understand what we needed to, tailored the day and discussion to our family, and even sent us back to the hotel room for hats when she thought we were not dressed warmly enough. Andrew was a great driver. When we finished the tours from Day 1 20 minutes early, they made sure to add 20 minutes to Day 2 so we did not feel cheated. Organization was excellent, and our tickets were waiting for us when we checked into our hotel. I was even counseled by Slava against the tours I tried to book on the same day, being told it was too much to handle (and this was the right advice). Their web address is www.parallelsixty.com. I highly recommend them."
50,“Beautiful City”,Returned from a Baltic cruise with Princess in September 2009.The most memorable port we visited was St.Petersburg.To see this city we booked a private your with Tatyana Churikova of TJ Travel.The experience we had touring for 2 days with our guide Olga was absolutely the best.Not only was she knowledgeable of the history of Russia but she also took us to places for shopping and eating that were just great. I had never tasted a Russian pie until Olga brought us to this local place and believe me it was very good.So if you plan to do a cruise with a stop in St.Petersburg book a tour with Tatyana.
50,“My favorite city”,"This is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I have lived there before and have visited since then. There is so much history everywhere you turn. There are churches, palaces, museums, etc to visit everywhere. Some of those places are just gorgeous and filled with 17th and 18th century history.It is always great to just walk around the city. You end up walking between old building and along numerous rivers. Around every corner, you can find some cozy cafe to get lunch at or a fancy restaurant. The food is delicious, a bit fattening at times but sooo good. And in between all the eating there are numerous boutiques and malls to explore with beautiful European fashions.Overall, it is a beautiful city with numerous places to explore."
50,“Beautiful City”,"We were in St. Petersburg only 2 days. It was just enough time to see the highlights on a concentrated tour we took with some shipmates. St. Petersburg is a very beautiful city with so much interesting history. The Russian royal families all built palaces here. Catherines Palace, Peterof, The Church on Spilled Blood and the Grand Choral Synagogue were some of the highlights. There are certain restrictions that Westerners won't be familiar with, but not many at all. We weren't allowed to photograph inside the beautiful subway stations. Even simple questions to local police were met with arrogant, obnoxious answers or blank stares.Take a boat trip on the Nevis River, visit the many palaces and churches, eat at a local restaurant. You won't be disappointed. The prices aren't too bad in this city. Not like in Scandinavia.We were on a cruise, so I don't have any hotel information. This was the highlight port of our cruise."
50,"“St. Petersburg: Spiritual, Artistic, and Romantic!”","St. Petersburg is the spiritual soul of Russia. Known as the Venice of the north it does not disappoint. It is off the beaten track of typical western Europe tourist destinations. It is dark and brooding as it is opulent and exotic. The home of the Hermitage, winter palace of Catherine The Great, it is easily among the top five museums on the planet. Go on a day drip to Pushkin. Visit The Summer Palace and its famous Amber Room. Stroll the grounds of Alexandrevsky Park near by. Peterhof is another wonderful day trip only 45 minutes from St. Petersburg. Of the different boat tours, I prefer one of the canal excursions. It's a closer more intimate experience than a ride up and down the Neva River. The Church of the Spilled Blood, Kazansky Cathedral, and St. Isaac's Cathedral are all within a 15 minute walk of each other and quite close to The Hermitage. Then head over to The Idiot Cafe, my personal favorite, located in the same building Dostoyevsky's rumored to pen the classic novel by the same name. You'll find yourself immersed in a romance that will keep St. Petersburg on your list of future destinations for years to come!"
50,“Worth every penny...”,"We included St. Petersburg on a recent cruise with Princess. What a beautiful city. We were a bit aprehensive about visiting Russia but everyone was lovely and the city is indiscribable. The architecture is like no other and everywhere you look you are in awe of the spendor and wealth once imaginable there.The Hermitage Museum is worth a trip in itself. While only 20% of their collection is on display at any one time, you could spend the rest of your life just visiting this museum.We did a two day comprehensive tour but it just touched on enough to make us wanting for more. I would never hesitate to go there again on our own and give it a try. Too much to see...so little time."
40,“Young feel of an old city”,"I visited St. Petersburg, then still Leningrad, last time in 1975. It was a beautiful city then and to this day it remains so with all the ornate architecture and museums and river canals. What struck me this time around, in September of 2009, was the city's youthful feel. Because of many Universities and other Colleges, theaters and actors' schools, I felt that most of the people I encountered were young people. In the numerous cafes, restaurants and bars, and nightclubs that are everywhere (and they were definitely missing on my previous visit), and all the luxurious stores, young people seem to occupy them all and the streets. The fast driven cars and traffic are also new addition to this city that was very dormant as I recall it so many years ago. While visiting many other cities in the region, I have to say that I enjoyed St. Petersburg the most. As a wheelchair user I did encounter some difficulties moving around the city. The ramps off the sidewalk mostly inadequate since they are too high for any wheelchair, so getting on or off them was a challenge. The Hermitage was the only place I felt was completely equipped for people like me. They had lifts and elevators throughout the building and even let me into the museum free of charge. The hotels, however, even as huge as Oktiabrskaia, were ill equipped, the above mentioned hotel located on the Nevsky Prospect - the center of the city - had a useless ramp leading up the stairs to the main level of the hotel. For the prices they charge they should have been better equipped. Maybe they should contact the management of the Hermitage to find out where they could purchase the same lift as at the museum. Overall, my visit to St. Petersburg was pleasant and I would recommend it to all to visit at least once in their lifetime."
50,“Cathedrals of St. Petersburg”,"You will see the big gold dome of St. Isaac's from anywhere in the city. Make it your first stop. Great paintings inside, and a good place to buy amber jewelry. The shops nearby give tour guides commissions for steering you there, buy in the church and don't listen to them. Second stop, St. Peter and St. Paul, the Romanov dynasty is buried here. Be sure to stop in the hallway to see the lineage charts. Last and best, Church on the Spilled Blood. Floor to ceiling mosaics all the way up to the domes. Not a surface is left uncovered. Pay the small charge to take photos, you really want them when you get home!"
50,“Russia is changing for the better - at least in St Peterburg”,"We go every 2 years to St Petersburg. Our latest trip was Aug/Sept 2009. Prices for dollar wielding tourists have gone up, but the general standard of tourism is better too. It rates as a really interesting place to visit."
50,“My trip to St Petersburg Russia”,"Without a doubt this is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I admit I was nervous over the idea of visiting Russia alone but I managed to find an excellent tour guide that knew the city inside and out.. Most people think as Moscow as the capital of Russia and overlook the fact that St Petersburg served that role for over 200 years.Regardless of your interests you are bound to find it in the city. During my stay I went to see the ballet Carmen at the Mariinsky Theater and dinning at fine restaurants in the evening. The days were spent viewing artwork by the masters such as Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci in the Hermitage Museum or walking the halls of the various palaces built by the Romanovs.I found the people friendly, the city easy to navigate and the culture intriguing."
50,“Loved Russia”,I took a Baltic Cruise in May that visited St. Petersburg. I feel in love with the city and country as a whole.
50,“Two day visit to St Petersburg Russia”,"Visited this city the beginning of September and had perfect weather. Sunny and warm and felt we were very lucky as we were told by the guide that they only had 30 days of decent weather throughout the year. Most of the buildings in the city centre were very impressive but I advise tourists to read up on the sights before visiting. Our visit was from a cruise ship, so we were covered by an overall passenger visa, but had to present our excursion ticket together with our passport to the Immigration Control who were quick and courteous. One could not leave the ship unless one was on an excursion and I found this very restrictive as we are normally independent travellers. We took the tour of the city and there were opportunities to see and take photographs of the main tourist sight-seeing spots and also the next day the Church of the Spilled Blood and we were allowed one hour on our own, so we walked down Nevskiy prospekt (the main shopping street) Visited a large store in the centre which was founded 300 years ago. Also we visited Grand Hotel Europe which was most impressive."
50,“DenRus Tours”,"We went to St. Petersburg July 2009. Two families 4 adults and 3 teens, I was concerned that the cruise tours would be crowded and boring for our teens so I booked a private tour with DenRus... which I had read very good reviews ... I got to tell you this was the best decision!!! Our tour guide was fantastic ...LUDMILA.. she was able to engage our teens in a wonderful tour through this magnificent and interesting city.. for 11 hours we enjoyed every minute of the visit and her company.. she was funny and very energetic. I strongly recommend if you are going to St Petersburg to work with her. Our immigration was very smooth and pleasant , they take care of all the details."
50,“our favourite holiday”,"Both my wife and myself grew up during the period of the 'cold war' and we had no idea what to expect during our visit to St. Petersburg. Our friend there had sent photos and DVD's which aroused our interest and desire to visit, however the reality of our trip far, FAR exceeded our expectations.Beginning with our contact with Marina Wilson (www.st-petersburg-visit.com) the planning of our holiday, choice of hotel, visa support, advice and guidance were so helpful to we first time travellers abroard. All our requests and questions were answered with quiet efficiency and our worries regarding our visit to the city were charmed away by this wonderful person. In fact the concern for our safety proved to be completely unfounded. At the hotel, every shop and restaurant the staff were most accommodating, spoke sufficient English and made our presence there an absolute delight.From the moment we were met at the airport by Sergei to our sad and somewhat reluctant departure some 7 wonderful days later, the whole of the holiday was a total eyeopener and will remain forever in our memories.This is such a wonderful and interesting city particularly during the period of the white nights with its Palaces, Museums, Monuments and Parks; the spectacular architecture of its old buildings and its history is quite incredible. The river, bridges and canals are a delight to experience and there would be no better guide than Marina to enhance the pleasure. Her love of the city and her knowledge of its sights and history are without fault.We realised after our return home that there was so much more to see and experience and now regret the shortness of our stay. We will most certainly return as soon as possible and would not hesitate to again enlist the services of Marina and Rossi Tours. We would willingly endorse and recommend her and this wonderful city to any persons contemplating such a holiday.John and Elizabeth Gibson,Australia."
50,“Alla-tour - excellent”,"We concur with the other reviewers. We were on the Cunard's QV, and they dessiminated the same doctrine in regard to disembarking. All you need to say is that you are on a tour. We were the first ones to disembark, and there was no problem. When the ship person on the asked us were we on a tour, we replied, we were on a tour. At immigration, the Russians want your pre-printed tour ticket, your passport, and a copy of your passport. They stamp your passport, put a small red paper which states day visitor, check your tickets from the licensed Russian travel agency, and keep the copy of your passport. Cunard had stated that immigration rules had changed and that privately booked tours would have to wait. The is not true. I believe there is enough business to go around. Some travelers' comfort zone is booking excursion through the ship; other's like to book local independent tours.Alla-tour is outstanding. They delivered on all that they had stated. If you pay in crisp, new American dollars, there is a 5% discount. The banks in Russia charge a 10% fee for exchanging damaged dollars into rubles.We were 8 people on our tour."
50,“St Petersburg - Alla Tours”,"We have just returned from a fantastic cruise with Holland America. The Highlight was our 2 Day Tour organised directly with Alla Tours.Firstly - you dont need a visa! So dont let your travel agent, tour company, or cruise line tell you otherwise.Secondly the groups are small, max 20, there were 14 in our group, the ship has buses with up to 50 people, not easy to get around or hear the guide in the Hermitage for example.Thirdly, on reviewing what we achieved and saw compared to the ship prices we estimate our tour was half price, but in any case you would not be able to achieve what we did in 2 days using the ships tours.The instructions on the web site are excellent, you dont pay anything until the end of the first day, lunch is included both days, the new mercedes coach was very comfortable, Julia our guide was lovely and knowledgable and Dimitri the driver courteous and safe everything is included.They were a wonderful 2 Days. Everywhere was terrific but the highlights were, the Yusopov Palace, the Hydrofoil to and the wonderful fountains and gardens at the Peterhof, the Amber Room and the Cathedral of the Spilled Blood.Because the coach was so comfortable and we were a small party it was not too tiring( we are both in our 60's)The first day was from 07.30 to 17.50 and the second 08.00 to 16.00 we paid $285 each ( paid cash 5% discount) a bargain with all fees early entry to The Hermitage, Lunch and the Hydrofoil thrown in.They also took us to 2 shopping locations, ( but only for about 20 mins each) these were of surprisingly good quality with reasonable prices, no hassle and coffee or vodka and spotless toilets.We can recommend them, dont be frightened about the visa talk, it really is no problem getting off the ship and through Russian immigration, its exactly the same for those using the ships tours."
50,“Wonderful place”,"St Petersburg is a beautiful place with so much to see.Yes the Catherine palace is ""new"" but the Germans did not leave much. The Russians being canny people they removed most of the treasures before the Germans arrived.The palaces have been painstakingly restored.The Memorial to the Siege of Leningrad is breathtaking. It commemorates the ordinary people and their suffering. How many Americans would endure a 900 day siege without surrendering? Language is a problem but learn please and thankyou and everything will be fine.We have been twiceon our own and had no problems. The metro is wonderful.We enjoyed the beauty and elegance of the Russian women. All were slim and wore proper shoes and skirts and dresses. jeans were only worn by Americans who were also the ones wearing trainers.The Hermitage has the best art collection in the world.We found out how to see the Brilliants room by asking at the desk. It was an extra 300 roubles but we were in a group of 6 with a wonderful guide.Marvellous experience.Maybe the people who write such awful reviews of St Peterburg are intolerant. We love it and would happily go back but I think the years are defeating us.Have a wonderful time."
50,“St. Petersburg -- Excellent Shore Excursion”,"We were on a cruise in the Baltic (July 2009) and one of our stops was St. Petersburg. We read about different shore excursions provided by RCCL and decided to look for an independent excursion. After a lot of research we booked the 2 day complete tour with Alla Tours. You can find their website through google. We were given a letter by RCCL 2 days before we got to St. Petersburg that stated that we would not be able to leave the ship for our excursion until after all of the people who purchased theirs from RCCL -- in other words, we would be lose 2-1/2 hours of port time because we booked independently (according to local immigration). When we spoke with the customer service, they kept repeating the same thing -- that they were advised by immigration. We were told that we could contact our independent excursion company of this via phone or email and they would pay for it. We did so and were advised by Alla Tours that this is a gimmick that they have been using at least since last year to scare people from using independent companies. Thank goodness we were advised about stunt this on other websites in advance. The cruise companies try to intimidate you into taking their tours and charge much more. We booked the 2 day complete tour for $300 US per person. Our first day included a city tour, Peter and Paul Cathedral and then the fortress. We also stopped at a nice little shop with good prices for numerous authentic souvenirs. We then took a 30 minute hydrofoil ride to the Peterhof Palace and gardens which were absolutely beautiful. We then had a picnic lunch (provided by Alla) on the grounds of the Peterhof. It was lovely. We then took a ride to Catherine's Palace. Upon entering, our guide looked at all of us and said ""prepare to be impressed"". Just when you thought you had seen it all, you were more impressed in the next room: an emerald room, a ruby room, the amber room (and yes, I mean the walls were covered in amber). And that was only day 1. The second day of the tour included the tour of the Hermitage. We spent approximately 3 hours there. It was awesome. We then headed for the Church of the Sacred Blood. It was magnificent. Our next stop was St. Issac's Cathedral. Another unbelieveable site. We were then treated to a typical Russian lunch at a restaurant in the city. This was also provided by Alla Tours. Our final stop was us Yusupov Palace. This is where Rasputten was murdered.I can only tell you that when we spoke with fellow pessengers who booked there excursions with the ship, they had to wait in longer lines to see everything and did not see as much as we did. Our tour guide, Julia, was very informative about the history and current happenings of St. Petersburg. I would highly recommend using them for your visit to St. Petersburg."
50,"“SS Peter & Paul Cathedral, Peter & Paul Fortress”","The Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral – (Petropavlovsky Sobor)in The Peter and Paul Fortress – Saint Petersburg, Russian FederationIn May of 2009, I achieved a long held desire of visiting St Petersburg in the Russian Federation. I had read so much in the past about St Petersburg and Russia. I was fascinated by the story of the Romanov Dynasty, the rulers of Russia since 1613, and especially about Tsar Peter the Great. He decided in 1697 to visit other countries in Europe to expand his knowledge and studied carpentry in Holland and shipbuilding in England. Both of these trades were to prove very useful when he founded the new city of St Petersburg in 1703 and in fact helped Peter to start building the Russian Navy.His idea in creating this new city was to drag Russia into the 18th Century by building a new capital city on the Gulf of Finland which would face the West. He realised that the old capital Moscow would not change, as it was inward facing and backward in its ideas. By building a new capital he could control what it would look like and incorporate new styles of architecture from Western Europe with older Russian architecture.The marshes which surrounded the River Neva where St Petersburg was built had originally been occupied by the Swedes.I decided that one place I must visit was the Peter and Paul Fortress and the Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral inside as it contained the tombs of many of the most interesting Rulers of Russia since 1703.The Peter and Paul Fortress, named after the Saints, was started in 1703 and was designed to protect the city from invasion, mainly by the Swedes. After the Battle of Poltava in 1709, where Peter defeated Charles XII of Sweden, this became less important. The fortress is built on the north side of the Neva River on the small Hare (Zayachy) Island. The fortress is a start shaped construction with two bridges connecting it to the much larger Petrogradsky Island and then to the mainland.The Cathedral of St Peter and Paul was started in 1712 and took 20 years to build, being consecrated in 1733. It was the first stone church in St Petersburg, designed by Domenico Trezzini, an Italian architect, and has a spire 400 feet high, the second tallest structure in the city with a gold angel on top. The spire, which is covered in pure gold leaf, can be seen glinting in the sun from across the Neva and creates a long lasting impression. The style of the cathedral is Baroque.Previous to Peter, all the Tsars of the Romanov Dynasty had been buried in the Cathedral of the Assumption in the Moscow Kremlin. Peter decided that from his reign on, he and all Future Tsars, would be buried in the St Peter and Paul Cathedral in his new Capital City. In fact from Peter onwards only two Tsars were not buried there.As I entered the Cathedral, I thought of all I had read about this beautiful building, but it did not prepare me for the overwhelming sight of the fantastic gilded interior and by the forty identical impressive white marble tombs of the Tsars, Tsarinas, Grand Dukes and Duchesses of Russia. The interior is decorated with paintings and precious icons and across the eastern end an Iconostasis, a screen with doors leading to the sanctuary. These tombs of the rulers of Russia reminded me of some of the great personalities that they contain, firstly Peter the Great himself, a major character in the history of Russia, Catherine the Great who reigned over Russia for thirty four years and is largely responsible for the amazing collection of art in the Hermitage Museum and Alexander I who lead the Russian army against Napoleon at the Battle of Borodino, commemorated famously by Tchaikovsky in his 1812 Overture with booming canons and the bells of Moscow. Two tombs are not made of white marble, those of Tsar Alexander II and his wife Maria Alexandrovna. Their tombs are pink and green Altai jasper and are differentiated from the others as Alexander was assassinated in March, 1881 by a bomb which exploded near his carriage. The Church of the Spilled Blood was built in central St Petersburg to commemorate his death.The Chapel of St Catherine has been created at the western end of the Cathedral to commemorate the last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra and three of their five children. They were brutally murdered in Ekaterinburg in 1917 during the Russian Revolution, along with members of their household and are considered to be martyrs by the Russian people. I had read the book “A Lifelong Passion” by Maylunas & Mironenko, which is the collection of letters exchanged between Nicholas and Alexandra during their lives together. This is a real insight into their lives at the Russian Court and during their internment in St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg. Their remains were interred in 1998, 81 years after they died. The remains of what are believed to be the Grand Duchess Marie and the Tsarevitch Alexei were only found in 2007 and are yet to be interred in the Chapel.The last burial in the Cathedral is the tomb of Marie Feodorovna, the wife of Alexander III and mother of Nicholas II. She was a Princess of Denmark before becoming Tsarina, and died in Denmark in exile after the Russian Revolution. She was buried in Roskilde Cathedral near Copenhagen, but her wish was one day to return to Russia. This wish was granted in September 2006 by President Putin and Queen Margarethe of Denmark, 140 years after Marie first went to Russia, when her coffin was given a State Funeral in Copenhagen and St Petersburg and the coffin was interred in the St Peter and Paul Cathedral next to Alexander III.I had spent an hour looking at the tombs and thinking about the history of Russia and how it was focused in the Cathedral. If you are making a visit to St Petersburg, this is a place that you should see during your stay, you will not be disappointed and you will come away with an idea of the glory that was Imperial Russia.Chris Lacey Bevan"
50,“St. Petersburg--Venice of the North!”,"Just got back from St. Pete and miss it already.The city is absolutely wonderful, it's our second trip there and I still feel that we just scratched the surface. So here are the things that I hope you might find useful for your visit to St. Pete.First of all Hermitage-- Every first Thursday of the month is free entrance. Unless you would like to see European painters and Roman and Egyptian artifacts stick to the ""Russian Rooms"" and head down to the ""Menshikov Palace"". It gives you a great perspective on life during Peter the Great (entrance ticket is only 60 Rb!) but be aware that place works from 10:30-16:30 (on the website they give you different hours.) We decided not to take a tour guide that is offered by the museum and I am glad we didn't. The tour that passed us felt rushed. They have Information cards in Russian and in English, that gives you complete explanation about the room and things in it.The day Trip to Pushkino (Catherine's Palace) and Peterhoff. Head down to the intersection of Nevskiy Prospekt and Dumskaya Street (m. Gostiniy Dvor). There is a tour company, if I am not mistaken ""Eclectica Tours"" they have an orange sign. They give tours in English for a very decent price, which includes transportation and entrance tickets to the museums. If you are buying 2 trips try bargaining (we did).I would also like to recommend the walking tour. It is physically demanding(4-5 hrs), but well worth it, we were taken to places that we would have never discovered on our own. We used a company called ""Peter's walking tours"" found them on the internet. The website gives you all the explanation to the tours that they do and prices. According to the research that I have done, this company was the cheapest only 600 Rb for their regular tours.I would also recommend visiting Ysupov Palace, they have an audio guide but I found it very technical, no information on who lived there or a bit of history about them, only which style was the room decorated in, so if you find a guide, definitely go for it!Enjoy the Venice of the North!"
50,“Amazing cruise destination with the MV Discovery”,"Before we arrived in St. Petersburg we were told by a Russian travel agent that our cruise ship, MV Discovery, would be docking in the Cargo Port. However, in the early hours of Saturday, 6th June 2009, we sailed past the cargo port to dock in the best possible place, the English Embankment. If you do dock in the cargo port, I believe it is very difficult to be an independent traveller and would recommend a local guide or excursions. If you are lucky enough to dock at the English Embankment and can read cyrillic, having your own visa is worth every penny. (But it has to be purchased before you leave home.) We were able to go through passport control and walk everywhere on our own, returning to our ship in the evening. We were able to take the Metro (when we found the stations which weren't easily identified) which take you down long and steep escalators with a lady sitting in her cabin at the bottom. We did take a morning tour of the Hermitage which allowed us early entry and went to St. Catherines Palace and Peterhof with a group on our final day so that we were sure to be back on the ship in good time. Being there in June gave us the opportunity to see St. Petersburg White Nights, fireworks from Peter & Paul Fortress at 11:30pm followed by the bridges being lit a little later. We could not believe the number of people who remained inside the ship when the night time views were just amazing. The Peterhof gardens are a must with its beautiful statues and fountains. St. Petersburg has so much to see and do but I feel many of the local people still have a long way to go before they will accept foreign tourists. It is not surprising when you know about their past history but I hope they will learn to welcome tourists."
50,“Magical trip to St Petersburg”,"Visit took place between April 19 and April 23 2009 and included two days in Moscow (separate Review posted on Trip Advisor)We started planning and booking in early February 2009.My Wife had a lifetime ambition to visit St Petersburg and, in particular, the Mariinsky Theatre to watch performances by the Kirov Ballet. We both wanted to experience the attractions of this wonderful City - including The Hermitage, Peter and Paul Fortress, St Isaac’s Cathedral, Admiralty - and to taste life in this famous place. We were most certainly not let down!We decided to arrange the entire trip by ourselves - i.e. without involving any Third Parties/Tour Agencies. We found Trip Advisor a wonderful asset and full of practical advice. The comments and feedback from a person named Veresch on Trip Advisor were invaluable - as were the comments and extremely helpful tips given by a man from the USA names as Spyderworld on Trip Advisor.The ""problems"" securing a Visa did not deter us one bit. We knew that we needed ""an official invitation"" and a ""tourist voucher"" before the Russian Embassy would even look at our Visa Application. We knew also that Travel Tickets had to be booked and paid for in full prior to Application and that Travel Insurance Policy was available - including relevance to travel to Russia. (It is worth spending some time checking your Policy's contents prior to purchase.)We live in north Wales and our nearest International Airport is Manchester. We found that the best deal for us was that offered by Air France and the total cost of round-trip tickets for two from Manchester to Paris (CDG); Paris to St Petersburg; St Petersburg to Moscow; Moscow to Paris; Paris to Manchester was £778.00.The Radisson SAS at Manchester Airport offered a deal for £115.00 whereby we had a night's accommodation and parking for our car for the duration of our trip. The access between the Hotel and Terminal 1 is via moving elevator and is only five minutes' to the actual check-in desk.We found tickets to the Mariinsky Theatre for both Sunday (The Nutcracker) and Monday (Swan Lake) and The Bolshoi (Don Quixote) on Tuesday at the Kremlin State Theatre through - what turned out to be an extremely reliable) a Web Site called Opera and Ballet.com. The offer a Toll-free 0800 telephone contact number from any country and we telephoned them and spoke to an extremely helpful operator while looking at the seating plans on our computer screens. The tickets were best seats in the house and were paid for with MasterCard. The spooky bit starts here, however, in that you will not actually receive your expensive and extremely valuable tickets until you check-in at your chosen hotel! The Web Site confirms via e-mail the transaction. (We forgot to inform our Credit Card Company in advance of the transaction and until they authorized the transaction, the e-mail confirmation of the tickets did not arrive until the next day.At this stage we decided to inform our Credit Card and Bank of what we were doing and the dates of our Trip - so that there would be no embarrassing phone calls from Hotel Reception counters etc to confirm payments! This also gave us peace-of-mind knowing that the bank and the Credit Card Company knew when we had left Russia.Hotels! We devoted a great deal of time to finding what we considered was an Hotel that suited our needs. People on Trip Advisor were suggesting Radisson on Nevsky Prospect and others the Astoria (on Saint Isaac’s Square). Many Trip Advisor contributors also mention a Hotel named ""Ambassador"" on Rimsky Korsakov Street - a twenty-minute walk away from Nevsky Prospect. We found this hotel ideally suited to our needs as it was located only five minutes' walk from the Mariinsky Theatre. As it turned out it was also only a twenty-minute walk (at most) from this Hotel to St Isaac’s Square (which, in turn, is a five-minute walk to the Hermitage!)We contacted the Hotel by e-mail and they responded with an on-line ""request for a room reservation"". They would supply the ""Invitation"" and ""Voucher"" for Visa purposes but here is the next spooky bit, we had to provide a copy of our credit card (front and back) and fax it to the Hotel. We felt extremely ill at ease with this part and mulled it over for quite a while before deciding on the following action. We have more than one Credit Card and use one in particular purely for any Internet Shopping. We particularly asked for a credit limit of £500.00 - to limit our exposure in event of Internet fraud, for example. This was the only way that we could secure the Hotels both in St Petersburg and in Moscow and we decided to proceed. What the Hotel wants is an assurance that the costs of preparing the Invitation and the costs of the first night's stay are both guaranteed if the customer does not show up! It worked a treat and written confirmation of our booking arrived via e-mail within a short period. In addition to this, copies of the ""Invitation"" and ""Voucher"" arrived - which we could use to obtain our Visa. Both Concierges at the Ambassador helped us to book a private car from the Airport to the Hotel and back; a private car and English speaking guide for our exclusive use from 12:00 until 17:00 - all secured on our limited funds Credit Card and confirmed by us e-mailing to the Hotel the ""Letter of Agreement"" to confirm all transaction.We purchased Travel Insurance and made certain that it included cover specifically for Travel within Russia.We now had all the items in place for our visit - and I am including the very same procedures for Le Meridian National Hotel in Red Square Moscow and all the tours we booked and airport transfers by private car. All this had been held on our £500.00 Credit Card - but the one thing, which we did not have, yet, was a VISA!Remember that you will need a Passport photo to stick to the Visa Application Form at the end of this section! In our case, the Visa was for ""Tourist"" purposes.We went on to the Russian Embassy Web Site - Visa Section - and the page told us that the Visa Application process had been outsourced to VF Services, 15-27 Gee Street, London, EC1V 3RD. We visited the Web Site and printed out a sample Visa Application Form to be able to see the information they required. Their Fees per Application are clearly listed and we decided that we would send our Application by Royal Mail Special Delivery Service and also purchase pre-paid Special Delivery Envelopes (one each) to enclose with out Application for use to send the Passport and Visa back to us. Have all your documents to hand before you begin the process as the system ""times-out"" after a long delay. We hit the ""Apply on Line"" button and the actual on-line Application Form opens in a different format to the one that we had printed out earlier as a sample. You must remember to click the ""Add"" another member of the family before you click the ""Finish"" button. After input of each individual answer to a question on the Application Form, the on-line service clears the screen and a few seconds elapse before the information you have just input re-appears - but now validated. This happens each time you answer a question. Enter all reference numbers of Vouchers, Travel Insurance and Airline Tickets etc. When you have completed the first person’s Application, remember to click on Additional Member of the family. Once we had completed this process for each of us, the Site produces a completed version on the Form for each Applicant - with a long reference number in the top left-hand corner of each Application Form. It is essential that you print copies of the Application Forms as you will need them a. to send off with your Passport and documents and b. to check the progress of your Application on-line by using the reference number. Hit the ""On-line Tracking"" button and enter the Form reference number and you will get a message to confirm the status. Make photocopies of all the documents you will be sending with your Passport. Double-check and check again to ensure that Forms have been signed and dated. Check also that the photo is on each Form and send off to VF Services, 15-27 Gee Street, London, EC1V 3RDThis process will take ten days. Keep checking the status of your Application on line. The Visa in our case cost £50.00 each plus a Service Fee of £22.50 each. As we live in north Wales, the cost of travel to London to present our Application in person and, maybe, to stay over-night to collect the Passport/Visa the following day would have been considerably higher than £22.50 each. This Service does what it says on the tin!By March 20, all documents for our trip were in place.Entry into Russia: Our research told us that the Airline would provide each of us with the relevant Immigration Form to complete on the plane prior to landing in Russia. Air France duly handed out documents but these related to declaring whether or not we were bringing money/valuable etc into the country that exceeding the quotas. When we came face to face with the stern faced Customs woman in St Petersburg, we were refused entry until we had each completed a Migration Card. The card is in two identical parts. The Immigration Officer on arrival will retain one part. We found them on desks in the Passport Control area. Ask your Airline. These are hugely important little documents - which you will need to gain entry and egress from Russia.Make sure that your Hotel Registers your Passport on arrival and issues you with a form to confirm that this has taken place. We made copies of our Passport and Visa etc before leaving the UK and we also informed the UK Foreign Office of the details of our visit - using its on-line service.We thoroughly recommend the Ambassador Hotel. Standards and Service were second to none. Staff were extremely helpful and very pleasant. Breakfast was superb - what a choice!The temperature during our visit ranged from zeroºC to a maximum of +3ºC but clear blue skies and sunny days.We took Dollar Notes. Each Hotel has Bureau de Change and it was extremely easy to change the Dollars into Roubles. We worked on the basis of 1000 Roubles being roughly the equivalent to £20.Russian Phrase book was extremely useful in our case.This is the down side of the last 20 hours of our trip: During our last day, we began to feel dehydrated (despite drinking plenty of fluids) and by late afternoon, I became extremely ill with severe diarrhoea, fever, fatigue, and excruciating stomach pains. Later that evening my wife also began to feel unwell.We both felt fine on our arrival in Moscow from St Petersburg and ate a snack at the five* Hotel in Moscow on the Tuesday afternoon.We became quite ill but wanted to return home and not involve Insurance Companies and extra nights and extensions to Visas (if allowed!) We drank boiled water and eventually found the strength to get to the Airport via our pre-booked hotel car. Unfortunately, however, I passed out for over four minutes at Sheremetyevo International Airport but after a short while, managed to regain some strength to persuade the Airport Doctor that I was feeling much better and able to fly. When we arrived home and provided ""samples"" to our GP, the results concluded that we had both contracted ""Salmonella"". Take care what you eat. The Russian Bottled water tastes horrible and I do not trust the quality. Do not use hotel tap water - even though ours said that the water had been filtered.Take care when out-and-about, as there are no ""health and safety"" measures in place in Russia. One example: We were walking towards the entrance to the Kremlin when I suddenly slipped - rather badly. When I recovered and checked out what had caused the slip, I found that someone had only just painted a manhole cover - without any signs to warn members of the public. There is no one to take your complaint either!We did not use any Taxis because we had pre-booked our own private cars, drivers and Guides.Both Pulkovo Airport Terminals and Moscow Terminals are extremely basic, to say the least, compared, for example with Manchester. You will find very few services indeed.When you arrive at Pulkovo Terminal 1 for a domestic flight to Moscow, you need to walk into the Terminal through the ""Arrivals"" door and walk or take the lift to the next floor up. This is where you will find the Check-in desks and Flight Information Board.In Sheremetyveo International Terminal in Moscow, you actually enter from street level into the Departures Hall. In our case, it was Air France and although their Tickets and Service booth is on the extreme left hand side of the Terminal, their flight check-in desk is on the right!Allow plenty of time to visit the Hermitage. All buildings are extremely well heated in Russia - including the gigantic St Isaac’s Cathedral.With the exception of the ""Salmonella"", the trip was fantastic. We will visit again at the earliest opportunity - maybe the Festival of White Nights"". Both Kirov and Bolshoi Ballet productions were thrilling and wonderful.Bravo St Petersburg.Bravo."
50,“A Very Underrated City”,"Number one on the list of things to do has to be The Hermitage. According to the Guide, it would take you 11 years to look at every exhibit and they are not exaggerating. There are paintings by every known artist on display which are amazing - Rembrandt, Van Gogh etc and the bujilding itself is worth a visit. Lotgs of time is needed to appreciate everything on display here.One thing to note generally is that the entrance prices for russian citizens and non russian are very different. However, in most places - students of whatever nationality - get in for free so if you are a student take some proof and save yourself some money. I left my registration card at home unfortunately.The Church of Spilled Blood which is a monument to the murdered Tsar Alexander is awesome and there is truly nothing like it anywhere else in the world.St Isaacs Cathedral is another place worth a visit. Just outside is a favorite place for newlyweds to have their photographs taken and we were invited to join in the toast by one couple and on to the party afterwards!"
50,“A Wonderful Week in St Petersburg in February”,"Here is an account of a wonderful week we spent in St Petersburg in FEBRUARY 2009. We chose to go when we had the most chance of experiencing a real Russian winter, and we were not disappointed. The city, and particularly the parks, were covered in a thick blanket of snow, the canals and rivers were frozen and, when the sun came out, the whole place looked like a winter wonderland. For anybody who is not afraid to dress up warmly and face the cold, I can honestly say this is the perfect way to experience this beautiful city.I spent a great deal of time researching it in the weeks running up to our departure and would really like to share our experience with other travellers who might be considering going there. I’m sorry it’s so long – but I’ve tried to make it easy to pick out bits which might be of particular interest! You should note that quite a lot of what I have written will not apply if you are travelling during the busy tourist season.I was travelling with my husband and our youngest daughter (14) and, as we always do, WE ARRANGED THE ENTIRE TRIP INDEPENDENTLY. However, like most things in life - the more you put into it, the more you get out of it – and we did do our research very thoroughly! None of us speak Russian, but with the help of a good phrasebook and dictionary we were able to make ourselves understood and read signs written in Cyrillic. The locals appreciated our efforts and were, for the most part, very helpful. Don’t be scared to go it alone – it is the way real travellers do it!BACKGROUND READING/VIEWING which I can recommend:CITY OF THIEVES by David Benioff – a coming of age story set during the Siege of Leningrad, a fast-paced, easy read for both teenagers and adults.RUBIES IN THE SNOW by Kate Hubbard - this was a perfect read for our teenage daughter. A a fictious diary written by Anastasia Romanov, starting at Tsarskoe Selo in 1911 and ending with the execution of her family in 1918.RUSSIAN ARK, a film by Alexander Sokurov. Watching this film before a visit to the Hermitage really gives an added dimension and depth to your visit. Made in 2002, this film was shot on location in the Hermitage in a single, unedited take. It takes the viewer on a journey through 300 years of Russian art & history. It received rave reviews, among them, the Guardian, “Breathtaking … a cinematic love letter to the Hermitage”.For those seriously interested in a more detailed history, I can thoroughly recommend ST PETERSBURG : A HISTORY by Arthur & Elena George. At 700 pages it is a hefty volume, but it is written in a very light and extremely readable style, with a lot of emphasis on social history. I am working my way through it!So far as guide books are concerned, the two I found to be most useful both before and during our trip were the DK EYEWITNESS guide and the THE ROUGH GUIDE you really don’t need anything else, apart from a good Russian phrasebook (we used the lonely planet phrasebook, which served us well).The WEATHER IN FEBRUARY. I read various comments suggesting that the winter is not a good time to visit, particularly if you plan to spend much time outdoors. Maybe we were lucky, for I certainly would not have had it any other way. During our stay (14th-21st Feb) the temperature varied between -2◦ and -9◦ and it snowed heavily several times. We saw sunshine and blue skies on several occasions. I’m sure some people would have found it quite uncomfortable and I think we were helped by the fact that we are used to skiing holidays.WHAT TO WEAR? We all wore thermal long johns under our jeans, a thermal vest, a rollneck sweater,a gilet and a ski jacket. Plus good gloves, neck warmers/scarves, hats and, most importantly a pair of sturdy HIKING/SNOW BOOTS. These need to be waterproof and to have a very good grip/tread on them. It also helps if they are thermal and comfortable to walk for miles in! The pavements are treacherous – sheets of black ice (sometimes covered with a light dusting of snow) and lumps of frozen slush. Don’t be fooled by the local women who speed along in their stiletto heels – they have obviously had years of practise! In what we otherwise found to be a very safe city there is no doubt that the only obvious danger ones faces is the very real risk of falling on the ice. Do take care.We stayed in a very comfortable boutique style hotel, the CASA LETO (my comments on that are in the relevant section of Tripadvisor), which was only ten minutes’ walk from the Hermitage. We spent 7 nights in the city, giving us six full days to explore. We were all agreed that we did not want to spend our whole time in palaces and museums – we wanted to get a real feel for the place and do lots of walking. Before leaving I put together a suggested plan for each of our six days and, amazingly enough, we pretty much kept to the plan.Our first full day in the city was a Sunday and we had decided that we wanted to go somewhere where we could join in with the locals at play in one of the city parks. We were really lucky that it had been snowing quite heavily before our arrival and the parks were looking at their winter best. Following recommendation from Eugenia (local expert on Tripadvisor), we took the metro to YELAGIN ISLAND (also known as the Central Park of Culture & Rest). We got on the metro at Sennaya Ploshchad and counted 3 stops north on the yellow line, getting off at Krestovskiy Ostrov. Emerging from the metro there is an entrance to a large park with amusements right opposite, but you need to turn right and walk a short distance to reach Yelagin. Entrance tickets (a nominal price) are sold at a kiosk just before the bridge which crosses over to the island. Tourists do not generally venture here and you will need your Russian phrasebook and some clever gestures tomake yourself understood! Don’t let that put you off, people generally were friendly and keen to help, and often seemed impressed that we were bold enough to have ventured off the beaten tourist path.We could not have asked for a more perfect introduction to A RUSSIAN WINTER WEEKEND. The park was a winter wonderland, full of people wandering along the wooded paths and across the frozen lakes, feeding the birds, sledging, cross country skiing, ice skating (on an open air rink near the old palace). All the while gentle, old style music was coming from little speakers in the trees around the park and there were kiosks selling hot drinks and snacks. Quite by chance we happened across a small military band playing in the snow not far from the ice rink. As they played a large group of locals – mainly older folk & all in their full length fur coats – started waltzing in the snow to the music. As we looked on the band struck up another tune, this time The Birdie Song, and we soon found ourselves joining in with all the locals in an energetic rendition of the Birdie Dance! It was a magic moment.There are a number of places where you can rent sledges, ice skates or skis. In fact we found that we were very happy just wandering around and soaking up the atmosphere, so we ended up not hiring anything. There is a little restaurant just inside the park, which looks a little like a restaurant in a ski resort, and we decided to venture in. This was our first experience of being confronted with a menu entirely in Russian, and a waitress who did not speak English! As ever, with the help of our phrasebook, looking around to see what others were eating, a lot of laughter and, finally, another waitress who had some English, we ended up with a very tasty lunch.Returning by metro to Nevskiy Prospekt, we called in to DOM KNIGI – a bookstore on several floors opposite Kazan Cathedral at the corner of Nevsky Prospekt and the Griboedov Canal (which leads up to the Church on Spilled Blood). Dom Knigi is a useful landmark - built for the Singer Sewing Machine Company in 1902, with a distinguishing glass globe on its roof. It has a good selection of postcards and stationery and it is fun to look at the Russian books, especially the children’s section (I bought a Russian edition of Guess How Much I Love You). There is also a café on the first floor, as well as a PUBLIC TOILET which is clean and free – we made use of it several times, due to its cental location ! Like the majority of shops, Dom Knigi is open 7 days a week, until late into the evening (at least 10pm).We then crossed the street to KAZAN CATHEDRAL. This very much had the feel of a working church rather than a tourist attraction. It was early Sunday evening and the place was alive with people, all doing different things. There was a service going on in one corner, a choir singing from a balcony, people queueing to pay their respects at various side altars and other people praying in front of icons all around the church. It was all very informal and very alive, with people wandering freely to and fro – we did not feel we were intruding at all.We started our second day with a visit to the CHURCH ON SPILLED BLOOD. This is obviously a famous atttraction and needs to be seen, but I have to say that it was our least favorite place and it is would be difficult to spend more than 15 minutes looking around it. The Russian Revival style looks strangely out of place in St Petersburg. The area around the church is very attractive to walk around – we walked through the Mikhailovskiy Gardens and across Arts Square to theGRAND HOTEL EUROPE. I had heard that this was a good place to SEND POSTCARDS using their courier service via Finland (just ask the people at the reception desk and they’ll direct you to a little office). It costs RR100 per letter or card, and I can confirm that every card we sent arrived in England within 3 days, with a pretty Finnish stamp on it! It really didn’t take much effort to arrange this. I also put the Russian postal service to the test to see if it really does take weeks, sometimes months, for letters to arrive home – I’ve yet to discover.In the afternoon we took the metro down to Ploshchad Alexander Nevskovo, where we wanted to visit the ALEXANDER NEVSKY MONASTERY and, particularly the Tikhvin Cemetery. It took us two attempts to get there – although we had counted the stations we overlooked one stop (which was written very small on the map!). We had to go back down the escalator – which takes 2 minutes 50 seconds from top to bottom – and continue on to the next stop. When you come out of the metro the Monastery is only a couple of minutes’ walk away (there is a good map in the Rough Guide). THE TIKHVIN CEMETERY lies just inside the main entrance to the monastery – there is a small ticket office at the entrance to the cemetery – and here you will find the tombs of an extraodinary collection of people, notably Dostoevsky, Glinka, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky & Rimsky Korsakov. The cemetery was deserted except for a security guard and a few cats playing in the snow. Like so many places we visited, it looked eerily beautiful beneath a blanket of snow and was a truly fascinating & very picturesque place to wander through.We left the cemetery and crossed a small river into the main monastic complex and to Trinity Cathedral – this is a working church, free to enter, with a very similar feel to Kazan Cathedral. A useful tip – there is a toilet on the right just after you cross the river into the main complex!On Tuesday we went to THE HERMITAGE. We had purposely not walked in that direction since our arrival so as to maintain an element of anticipation! It was only a short walk from our hotel (but long enough for our daughter’s hair to freeze – she had not finished drying it before leaving!) and our first view was a classic image of the building across a snowy park.As you would expect from a world famous museum, all the facilities – ticket office, cloackroom, toilets, café, etc are very accessible and user-friendly. In February there are no queues, no crowds – we often found we had entire state rooms to ourselves. The floor plan/map provided by the museum (in English) is good, although it is still easy to get completely lost. Note that they refer to the ground floor as ‘the first floor’, the first floor as ‘the second floor’, and so on.We spent 4 or 5 hours in the museum and concentrated on the STATE ROOMS of the WINTER PALACE (marked as ‘Palace Interiors’on the plan) and 19th & 20th Century European Art. The State Rooms are all on the ‘second floor’ and while you are on this floor it is also worth seeking out two other exhibitions : tucked away in Rooms 143-146 is a collection of TROPHY ART appropriated from the Nazis at the end of WWII. It includes works by Renoir, Van Gogh, Gaugin, Degas, Manet, Monet & Cézanne. This is clearly still a very sensitive issue – the collection is not referred to on the museum plan and, unlike elsewhere in the museum, photography is not allowed. Also on this floor, in Rooms 175-187, is an EXHIBITION OF RUSSIAN INTERIORS– it consists of a series of rooms (smoking room, library, study, nursery, etc) re-creating the style of each decade from the early 1800s to the Revolution. Originally opened as a temporary exhibition in the 1980s, it proved so popular that is has remained ever since.On the ‘third floor’, in Rooms 314-350, you will find the collection of MODERN EUROPEAN ART from the 19th & 20th Centuries. It is a breathtaking collection, with a stunning range of works by Picasso, Matisse, Gauguin, the Impressionists and many others.We chose Wednesday as our big day out of the city. We planned to spend the whole day visiting Tsarskoe Selo – Catherine Palace, Alexander Palace and the parks. We chose to go by suburban train and then walk from the station to the palaces (no metro or minibuses). Having done the journey successfully in both directions, I can honestly say that I would not consider going any other way. The whole experience was a delight and had a real sense of adventure about it.HOW TO GET TO TSARSKOE SELO (AND BACK) FROM ST PETERSBURG BY TRAIN: Go to Vitebsk Station (either walk, take the metro to Pushkinskaya, or take a taxi – we took a taxi from our hotel which cost RR500 for the 10 minute ride). VITEBSK STATION is ‘the finest Style Moderne building in St Petersburg’ and has recently been restored to its full splendour. It is a terminal for both inter-city and suburban trains.Go upstairs to the first floor, across a vast hall (by-pass any ticket offices you see on the way) and through to the platforms where the inter-city trains leave from. Over in the far right-hand corner (as you face the trains) there is a small ticket office and turn stiles which take you through to the suburban trains. We couldn’t find this straightaway so I went up to a newstand and said Pushkin? in an inquiring manner and we were immediately pointed in the right direction. (Note: the train station at Tsarskoe Selo is officially called Detskoe Selo – ‘Детское Село’, but for the purpose of asking directions/buying tickets it is easiest to say ‘Pushkin’ – its other name – because you will be easily understood).Buy your return tickets to Pushkin at the little ticket office (using your phrasebook & gestures!) and go through the turnstiles on to the platform – it is just like a small town station, very quiet, with only a couple of platforms. If you are not sure which platform to use, just ask for Pushkin – you won’t have a problem. Trains run 2 or 3 times an hour (with a gap between 10:00 and 11:30). The journey takes exactly 30 minutes. Our train stopped at 6 stations along the way and the 7th one was Detskoe Selo. There were another couple of tourists on the train who were clearly relying on asking the locals when they needed to get off – no problem.The return train journey is even easier - arriving at Detskoe Selo station you go through the turnstile and take the little subway under the track to Platform 2. St Petersburg is the end of the line and trains run regularly several times an hour.Most people/guide books recommend that you get one of the minibuses which wait outside the station to take you to the palaces. However, we chose to walk (we also noticed the other ‘tourist couple’ looking at the minibuses, getting on one, then getting back off it and setting off on foot!). It takes between 20 and 30 minutes to reach the park gates – the town of Pushkin is very attractive, it was built as a modern town on a chessboar plan and it is a very pleasant walk along quiet, wide, tree-lined streets with pretty coloured buildings. It is not a difficult route – you go straight over the roundabout outside the station and basically carry straight on, bearing to the right. There is a very accurate map in the Rough Guide. When we walked back to the station it was snowing extremely heavily, but it was still a very pleasant walk.CATHERINE PALACE looked very beautiful in the snow, and we approached it through the park (which is free to get into during the winter). Even though it was very quiet and we were able to walk straight in, there were still a fair number of tour groups going through the Palace and I can’t imagine what it must be like at the height of the season. Just as in the Hermitage, the ticket office/cloakroom/toilets/café were all very efficient and self-explanatory. It takes around an hour to go through the Palace – there is no choice of route. I shall leave the description of the interior to the guide books.When we left the Palace we went out into CATHERINE PARK and started walking – it was a stunningly beautiful winter landscape, covered in a thick blanket of snow, dotted with pastel coloured pavilions and grottoes. The ponds and rivers were all frozen and covered in snow. Local people were wandering through the park, many of them pushing prams & feeding the birds. It is a very large park, especially when combined with the Alexandar Park (which is wilder than Catherine Park and which we also covered). We walked for a couple of hours with the help of the map in the Rough Guide, plus a park map I’d found on the internet (www.ticketsofrussia.co/maps/push800.html). Even with these we still managed to get a little lost and several times found ourselves inadvertantly walking across frozen rivers and ponds!We finally emerged from the park at ALEXANDER PALACE. If we’d just gone down the road between the two palaces it would have taken about 5 minutes – but we had spent a couple of very happy hours trekking the long way round through the parks! The Alexander Palace is a very different affair to the other palaces. A rambling Palladian pile, with a small entrance for visitors which is not entirely obvious (go up the steps to the left as you reach the building). It is very low key, but there is still a cloakroom and toilets, and little bags to put over your boots as you walk round. Looted by the Nazis, it has only been partly restored and each room has a life-sized photographic backdrop showing how it would have looked. There is no magnificence here but, as it says in the Rough Guide, it has ‘poignancy that other Imperial residences lack, due to the almost tangible presence of Nicholas, Alexander and their children’. Our daughter preferred it to the Catherine Palace because of this. Apart from the room guides, we were the only people in the building!As we came out of the palace the snow was falling very heavily, giant flakes, and we had a very happy walk back through the town to the station, watching the children as they made their way home from school.On Thursday we planned to visit the Peter & Paul Fortress, Peter’s Cabin and the Aurora, all within a short walk of each other across the other side of the Neva. We had intended to take the metro to Gorkovskaya but discovered, quite by chance, that this metro station is completely closed for refurbishment at the moment (Feb 09). So we decided to walk – it took the best part of an hour but it was a very scenic walk, crossing the bridge by the Hermitage over to the Rostral Columns and then across two smaller bridges to get onto the fortress. The views across the frozen Neva were stunning and we saw several people ice fishing in the middle of the river.Inside the fortress we only visited the PETER & PAUL CATHEDRAL. The interior is decorated in tutti-frutti colours and contains the tombs of almost all the Romanov monarchs, right through from Peter the Great to the last Tsar. It was particularly moving seeing the tombs ofNicholas & Alexander their children having been at the Alexander Palace the previous day. There is also an interesting exhibition of photographs and family trees relating to the Romanov dynasty. As we were leaving the Cathedral we heard RUSSIAN CHORAL MUSIC coming from a small room just to the right of the exit. There were chairs around the outside of the room and a small group of singers (men in long black robes) standing on some steps, who were making the most beautiful sound. Their voices had such depth and resonance it was hard to believe that they were singing without any accompaniment. Various people wandered in and sat down to listen. After a short while one of the singers smiled and indicated that there were CDs of their music available to buy on a table by the door. There was no pressure to buy and I can thoroughly recommend listening out for them when you visit the Cathedral. Note: we arrived at the fortress around midday and shortly afterwards a massive canon shot was fired (12:00, I guess) which made us jump out of our skins!Leaving the fortress we headed along the embankment towards PETER’S CABIN- the original log cabin built for Peter the Great in 1703 and the oldest residential building in St Petersburg. Now encased within a brick shell and surrounded by a small park, there are no obvious signs and it would be easy to miss if you didn’t know what you were looking for. Very low key, but evocative. We were the only ones looking around it. A visit takes no more than 10 or 15 minutes but it is clearly a sight of great significance for the people of St Petersburg and it is the closest you will get to the ‘spirit’ of the city’s founder.Another short walk along the embankment leads you to the CRUISER AURORA. I included this in our itinerary mainly for my husband’s sake – it is definitely more of a boy’s thing! However, anyone should be able to appreciate the sense of history – it was from this ship that a shot was fired in October 1917 to signal the storming of the Winter Palace and the start of the Communist Revolution. It costs nothing to look around the floating museum – you just wander up the gangway from the pavement and onto the ship. Several rooms below deck house an exhibition of the ship’s history (labelled only in Russian). Be careful if you plan to make a special trip to the Aurora – although in theory it is only closed on Mondays and Fridays, it apparently seems to open and close as it pleases.We had planned to return to the park behind the fortress and eat at ‘Zver’ before returning home, but we ran out of time and had to get back for the opera.And finally, on our last full day in the city we, we went off to the MUSEUM OF THE DEFENCE (SEIGE) OF LENINGRAD. Again, this does not seem to be on the main tourist radar (we couldn’t find any mention of it in the Eye Witness Guide), but it is described in the Rough Guide and shown clearly on their maps. We followed the Griboedova Canal and then walked along by the Summer Garden to the museum – not a very long walk from the centre. The Museum is clearly not set up for tourists and apart from a little leaflet in English about the Seige (the ‘Blockade’ as they refer to it), everything is labelled only in Russian. However, this does not really matter and anyone with an interest in this period of the city’s history will get something from a visit here. The museum consists of one large exhibition hall on the second floor and aims to give a real impression of what life was like in the city during the 3 years of the Seige, with plenty of emphasis on social as well as military history. Many of the scenes and exhibits are self explanatory, and most were donated by ordinary citizens shortly after the seige ended. A good look around takes about an hour. We were the only visitors apart from a group of young children (the boys all dressed in suits) who were listening very attentively to their teacher.We returned to the city centre via the Summer Garden – like all the other city parks we walked through, this was looking very beautiful beneath a thick blanket of snow –we never tired of wandering through the parks and watching the people. A perfect way to work up an appetite.In the afternoon we went to the SOUVENIR MARKET behind the Church on Spilled Blood. We had looked around earlier in the week and had a good idea of what we wanted to buy. We chose to do business with the men on the first two stalls you come to (standing with your back to the church). The first sells fur hats and the second mainly Russian dolls. They spoke good English, were interesting to talk to and gave us a good deal.I had no idea that this ‘report’ was going to be so long! I hope at least a few people will find what I have written to be useful to them.Elsewhere on the TripAdvisor website I will comment on places where we ate & drank (our favorites were the Кафе Сакартвело – on the corner of Nevsky P near the Lutheran Church, and The Idiot); on our hotel, the Casa Leto; and on our trips to the opera & ballet at the Mariinsky. And I’ll put up some photos! But for now, that’s all!"
50,“Great tour guide”,"Was just in St Petersburg for a quick 2 days (Sept/08). However still wanted to see all the highlights. Contacted many travel/tour companies. The one I went with RussianTourFamily, was excellent in every way. Thier prices were great and the service was excellent. The nice thing is you get American level service at a Russian price. The owner Timothy King is an American (living in Russia) married to a Russian so obviously very fluent as well as very responsive and timely with suggestions & e-mails etc. The guide recommnded a great restaurant , helped us exchange money , took us to a great little souviner market and even ran ahead to get all our tickets. Everything went off without a problem, exactly as planned. He even meet us and brought a bottle of Russian Vodka! I've used tour companies many times and This one rates right at the top, I would highly recommend them. Website is RussianTourFamily.com"
40,“Fasinating Place”,"There is so much European history, and antiquites. It's a learning experience on top of all the sites"
50,“trying out the review thing”,"Fantastic city, great people, excellent music. Food okay!Was there a few years ago. Would highly recommend."
40,“The old capital of Russia”,"I visited in 2002 (?)A very nice place, full of historical buildings and heritage. I visited in summer. Really like to see a white St. Petersburg in Winter time. I went with my younger son who was about 12 then. He liked the place very much."
50,“The most beautiful city in Europe”,St Petersburg is really worth going especially in the summer. The center is the most beatiful in Europe and Peterhof outside magnificent.Few hints for budget; The best way to accommodate is to hire an apartment for larger party an aparment in teh center costs around 100 USD a night and some can accommodate up to 8 persons.Besides the ordinary visit Vodka museum (right behind Church of Isac) and Kirov home Museum (first victim of Stalins terror) on Kamyoskovy prospect 2 kilometres from center.
20,“We could not wait to get out of Russia”,"We toured St. Petersburg on a Celebrity Curise tour in August, 2007. While the cruise line and the tour company did everything in their power, Russia does not care about tourist comfort. We felt like we were being ripped off at every turn. At the Russian folk music show, we were charged a ""photo charge"" to take a picture. Every welcoming band shaked their tip bucket our way...and there were bands at every bus stop. The Hermitage was about 100 degrees with 6,000 people in it. You could not move. One of our party passed out, another was pickpocketed. With the heat and humidity, I'm surprised the priceless art survives. People were at wits' end, and tour guides did more trying to keep the tour together than explain the features of the museum. Most of the highlights of the city are reproduction of what was original, especially Catherine's Palace. I do not believe that there is any original room still intact...everything is reproduced. We could not wait to leave the country. Thank goodness we were in a group...I would not feel safe on my own. But then again you cannot be on your own unless you have a specific visa for over $50.00. Another rip off. In fact, employees of the ship call Russia a ""scam"". Keep your time here at a minimum."
20,"“St. Petersburg, Russia”","I am an experienced traveller and I found St. Petersburg hard. We stayed for three days and would have been able to see all the highlights in two days. Don't take a cab into town from the arrivals terminal. Instead walk 1 minute to your left as you exit the airport and grab a cab at the departures terminal. Everything else in St. Petersburg is so cheap it is worth spending the extra money to stay in a really nice (by Russian standards) hotel. Make sure you are near the museum's and other sites you travelled so far to see. You won't encounter much, if any, english once you leave your hotel. Chain restaurants and cafes at the sites do have english menus. Most cabs are negotiable. Have the name and address of your hotel with you to show the driver. Most rides within the city center shouldn't be over 300 rubles. If you go to Catherine's Summer Palace, about 30 minutes by cab outside of town, tour groups get in at 10:00am, individuals cannot get in until noon. You are let in in groups, but the tour is all in Russian. As long as you are respectful you can move at your own pace. The Hermitage had almost every piece of art labeled in english and russian."
20,“Touring St Petersburg Russia”,"My husband and I just got back on May 18,2007 from a private visit to St Petersburg. Our trip was an overall wonderful experience. We went through an internet guide service to obtain our Visa requirements. We hired an all day guide for a visit to Catherine the Great's palace in Puskin. We had our own driver and guide and it was about $130 US Dollars for the day. One thing to avoid is their stop at souveir shops which we found out was over priced and they probably got a commission. The taxi drivers also jacked up their prices when taking us around, we found out that finding a Russisn speaking person to negociate the taxi was the way to go. They have no taxi meters. The Russian Fok show was wonderful, and worth taking in. Over all hardly anyone spoke English, so prepare to use sign language."
50,"“definitely get out of the city, too”","i highly recommend anyone going to russia anytime of year, but definitely try and get out of the city, too, to the smaller cities that are the REAL russia. st. petersburg is become less and less like real russia and far more westernized. it's definitely worth visiting, though, for all of the culture and history. there are amazing churches, palaces and such. a phenomenal restaurant is called Lagidze and serves georgian food. also, try the street food called shaverma. it's my absolute favorite food in the world."
40,“A Spectacular City”,"If you have decided to travel to St. Petersburg you will not be disappointed. The tourist attractions are beautiful and the food was amazing.I traveled to St. Pete's in mid-October and the weather was great. There was only one day that the weather didn't cooperate. The rest of the time, it was perfect touring weather. Not to mention, we saved a ton of money traveling off season.We stayed at the Nevksy Hotel 77 located off of Nevsky Prospect. It was in the center of everything, so we were able to walk everywhere. We paid about $107 USD per night. It was a real bargain, especially since it came with a full breakfast buffet each day. And it was a very clean. We were four blocks away from the Hermitage, two blocks from Church on Spilled Blood, and about six blocks from St. Isaacs.There are a ton of wonderful restaurants in that area as well. My only complaint would be that there weren't more restaurants featuring authentic Russian cuisine.I definitely recommend going to St. Pete's. However, I would try and get a direct flight next time. Flying in to Moscow was a bit of a nightmare. Make sure you check if your airline provides a shuttle from the international airport in Moscow to the domestic airport which is located down the road from the int'l airport. If you don't have shuttle service, you may fall prey to the Russian ""taxi sharks"". They were trying to charge upwards of $110 USD to drive you five minutes down the road."
50,“How Spectacular Can it Get?”,"I can't say enough good things about St. Petersburg. Some hints:-- give yourself plenty of time to see the Hermitage. It is enormous, full of drop dead artifacts, the floors are unbelievable, the colours are stupendous, and the ceilings are simply wonderful. If possible do part of it every day you are there-- The Church on the Spilled Blood, the Kazan Cathedral, and St. Isaac's Cathedral will take a good 4 hours to see them all., and welll worth every minute. The first one was my personal favourite -- mosiacs that are unbelievable-- Spend a day at Peterhof. Wander, listen, look, and be amazed-- Spend a day at Catherine the Great's summer palace. Opulence beyond belief.-- Spend a day wandering the streets to get a feel for it all"
30,“Memorable St. Petersburg”,St. Petersburg is a beautiful city to visit (when it's not cold like when we went in April). It was my first trip there and definitely not easy to go around not knowing the language (including not being able to read Cyrillic). Their subway system is amazing. It takes a few minutes to get from the street level to the level where the trains are running. You're not supposed to take pictures of their subway underground (some kind of a security concern?). The food is quite tasty. I hope you enjoy the pictures that show different places and local people.
40,“Going to St P in July - pack your umbrella & coat!”,"St Petersburg in July is WET. Do take an umbrella & DO take a coat and layers because you may find it colder than you thought it would be. If you do get sunny warm days in July, then you are lucky!Some other hints - the Hydrafoil to Petergof from the top of the Hermitage is 360R return. Its a great day out, but unless you want to queue for hours to get inside the palace there I would get there very early. You will find everywhere you go is overrun with tour groups who make for long queues everywhere!If you are English speaking only, then don't expect too much help from people, most everthing is catered towards russian tour groups.If you are planning to go to Pushkin for the day, take the 347a 'Palaces & parks' mini bus from outside the station mentioned in the Lonely Planet, you may need to walk around the whole square to find the right bus stop - its very confusing! Once at Pushkin we found that we could not go into Catherine's Palace until 4pm which was the time alloted to non a)russian tour groups, b) non tour groups - and then the price was 500rb per person! Forget that. We did tag along the back of a tour group to get inside and then walked around the gardens which were very nice.Hermitage - dont believe what you read about the queue being shorter/gone by lunchtime in summer, its long all day! We left about 3-4pm on a summers day and only then was there no queue which wouldn't give you enough time inside. Tip - get there early!For cheap ballet tickets in summer, we used ticketsofrussia.ru under the White Nights festival heading and bought 1st row, upper balcony at the Marinsky for something like $30usd each. The tickets can be deliverd to your hotel in russia or you canpick them up. Far more reliable than a tout as you can check out the seating on the web & pay accordingly.As a foreigner you don't always have to show a student card to get reduced entyr prices, it worked quite a bit for us in St P (not so much Moscow).Definately go to the top of St Isaacs on a nice clear day, the views are amazing!If you are after a REALLY top of the range meal, the Customs House rest cannot be beaten. We were celebrating our engagement and it was perfect for that - but not if you are on a budget!I hope you have a great time, it is a wonderful place."
30,“Visita a Sanpietroburgo .......”,"Bella ma mi aspettavo di più, sarà che desideravo questo viaggio da molti anni.Una città da visitare in 2 o 3 giorni considerando di dedicare 1 intera giornata all'Ermitage."
50,“Хорошее место для обедов и ординарных событий”,"Заведение имеет 3 зала: у входа (зимой и осенью может быть холодно), центральная часть (зимой при низких температурах может быть холодно за столиками у окна) и дальний - там детская комната (может быть шумно). Столики у окна предпочтительнее.Пробовал дорада по-сицилийски - очень понравилось. Апероль спритц делают на апельсиновом соке вместо содовой."
50,"“Venise du Nord, capital de la culture Russe”","J'ai découvert Leningrad/St Petersbourg en 1989 sous le régime de l'URSS. J'étais présent, quand suite à un référendum, en 1991 elle est redevenue St-Petersbourg. Je l'ai vue s'épanouir depuis.C'est la ville de mon épouse, j'y ai vécu plus de 6 ans. j'y retourne régulièrement pour voir ma belle-famille mais aussi pour goûter à son éclatement dans la culture comme une fusée dans un feu d'artifice. Ville martyre St-Petersbourg a un double nom. Son nom actuel et originel, et son nom de martyre, Leningrad. Pour tous les russes c'est et restera comme cela. un siège de 900 jours qui a laissé la ville exsangue, partiellement détruite. qui a été reconstruite à l'identique., même si a certains endroit on a du avoir recours à une sorte de stuc pour reconstituer des pierres qui ne sont plus disponibles, les carrières étant en Italie ou ayant fermé depuis longtemps. Une ville de Musées, pas une ville musée. Une ville Universitaire, qui possède l'un des plus beaux Opéras du monde ( le Marynskii) et un des plus célèbres Ballets classiques. Une ville de Théâtre, de festivals musicaux, et de bien d'autres atouts culturel. Une ville surtout où vous serez toujours bien accueillis par une population dont le cœur est aussi chaud que l'hiver peut y être froid. A visiter autour de l’Équinoxe d'été (20-21-22 juin) pour les nuits blanches et le festival du même nom, mais surtout pour profiter de l'absence de nuit ou presque. Ou alors pour la nouvelle année qui correspond à notre Noël et si vous avez de la chance, vous aurez de la neige et St-Petersbourg vêtira son habit d'Hermine."

50,“Красивейший город!”,"Всем, впервые приехавшим в этот прекрасный город, очень советую совершить экскурсию по каналам и рекам, посмотреть на набережные, проплыть под мостами, обязательно поцеловаться под поцелуевым мостом;) и просто погулять, не полениться, поднять голову и полюбоваться чудесными фасадами. А нам очень повезло! Приехав 24-го мая, посчастливилось попасть на День города!"

Там очень красиво! Люди спокойные , добрые. Город чистый. Метро блестит! Никто не бежит по эскалатору, с ног не сбивает (это я сравниваю с Москвой). Мне нравится питерская атмосфера . Да, самый большой минус в этом городе это климат. Но "" у природы нет плохой погоды""))) поэтому на это я внимание не обращаю. Один минус среди множества плюсов!Кто ни разу не был в Питере - советую его обязательно посетить!)"
50,“Любимый”,"Это мой любимый город. Здесь чувствуешь себя своим. Хочется возвращаться сюда снова и снова, к тихим ночным переулкам, к Неве, к шумному Невскому. Город очень теплый, атмосферный, гостеприимный, духовный, вдохновляющий, город открытий. Можно бродить по нему 24 часа, и открывать для себя что-то новое и таинственное."
50,“Прекрасное место для знакомства с прекрасным городом”,"Очень гостеприимное место в самом сердце города на Неве. Идеальные чистота и уют. Свежий ремонт. В номере, помимо кроватей, есть диван, стол и стулья, чайные чашки и чайник, холодильник, телевизор. Полотенца, тапочки и халаты для гостей. Персональная ванная комната находится рядом с комнатой гостя, и это достаточно удобно.Персонал очень внимательный и заботливый. Константин был настолько любезен, что встретил нас и позволил заселится в номер рано утром (без всякой дополнительной оплаты). Однозначно рекомендую для проживания."
50,“splendida”,"città da visitare e ancor meglio da vivere per un po'. non lascia deluso nessuno. impensabili le dimensioni che superano ogni aspettativa. sontuosa e bella in ogni aspetto di sè, anche quelli contrastanti. la magnificenza degli enormi palazzi alla decadenza degli interni dei condomini trascurati. città dove in tutto si respira cultura, dove anche le facciate fanno citazioni, dove l'italia dei grandi architetti e scultori ha dato molto di sè. città con veramente molto da visitare, da tener conto delle distanze che sono impensabili. non perdete anche quello che sta fuori dal centro per capire come la gente davvero vive, non perdetevi i locali che sono ad ogni angolo sermpre pieni di gente che balla fino al mattino. citta piena di giovani. città dove si mangia e si beve sempre. città con i negozi sempre aperti.Se andate in inverno procuratevi un giubbotto, scarpe, guanti, sciarpa e cappello di categoria, ma sotto vestite la maglietta a maniche corte! si entra in qualsiasi posto e ci sono 23 gradi, se vi coprite troppo starete sudati tutto il tempo.verde come poche città al mondo, anche se in inverno lo si immagina solamente perchè è sempre coperta di neve.i parchi sono ovunque e splendidi.affascinante. un posto dove ritornare.accosta"

Каждый раз, возвращаясь откуда-нибудь, убеждаюсь, что в этом великом городе есть многие города Европы, и Таллинн, и Стокгольм, и Прага, и Барселона, и т.д.Поэтому тот, кто не был в Петербурге, потерял многое... И тот, кто был, но не стер подошвы о его мостовые, не видел Города, не познал его. Санкт-Петербург - это прежде всего особое пространство, пропитанное удивительной атмосферой... Попробуйте ощутить это, попробуйте принять Город, и тогда он вас не отпустит, и будет заставлять возвращаться сюда снова и снова"
50,“Самый красивый город Росии”,"Петербург это город-музей. Даже если вы просто гуляете по его улицам - вы в музее. Дух прекрасных зданий 18-19 столетия просто окутывает вас. Главное - никуда не спешить. Просто гуляйте. Очень рекомендую пройтись вдоль канала Грибоедова. Как только вы отойдете от Невского проспекта, вы попадете в совсем другую атмосферу. Обязательно загляните перед прогулкой в интернет (гугл вам в помощь), почитайте про историю домов нужного вам квартала, про события, которые там происходили на протяжении трех столетий. И уже ваша прогулка будет самостоятельной экскурсией. Очень необычен Петербург с воды. Прогулка на катере обязательна! Но выбирайте комфортабельное речное судно, а не маленькую шлюпку. Сэкономите сто рублей, а дискомфорта будет на гораздо бОльшую сумму. Пристани раскиданы буквально по всему центру Петербурга. Средняя цена поездки 400-500 рублей."

50,“10 лет спустя...”,"В далёком 1995 году было моё посднее свидание с одним из красивейших городов Мира Санкт-Петербургом. И судьбе надо было распорядиться так, чтобы я вновь оказался в этом городе с его многочисленными каналами, и непохожими друг на друга улицами и площадями. Смог вновь ощутить только ему присущую атмосферу, Наслаждаться его великолепной архитектурой, доброжелательностью жителей, бродить по улицам, каждая из которых связана с историей государства Российского. И хотя это была бизнес поездка с достаточно плотным графиком встреч и переговоров. Однако благодаря позитивной энергии Санкт- Петербурга 3 дня пролетели, как одно мгновение и кроме того результаты превзошли все мои ожидания."

10,“visita superficiale e di .... corsa”,"Sono sceso da una bella nave di crociera. La Russia rimane il regno delle costrizioni, Per scendere da soli bisogna avere non solo il passaporto ma anche il visto... solo che per ottenerlo da soli costa molto, mi dicono 150 euro e ci vuole peraltro molto tempo per ottenerlo. Si è quindi costretti ad affidarsi alle gite collettive, scelte dalla nave MSC peraltro, visto che esiste la possibilità per le agenzie di viggio di avere visti ""collettivi"" questo divento l'unico modo per vedere la città. Si diventa però ostaggi di gite guidate fatte in tutta fretta che fanno assaporare, vedere da lontano tanti posti che potrebbero essere pure belli se visti con i tempi giusti. Sono stato a san Pietroburgo ma non posso dire di averla vista, sono stato all'ermitage, so dove sono i quadri ma non ho potuto avere il tempo neanche di vederli in modo superficiale. Consiglio di programmare il viaggio con amici fidati, abbattere il costo del visto, e vedervi questa città con i tempi giusti e senza guide. Attenti ali ladri, ve ne sono tantissimi. Meglio ancora evitare di visitare la russia fino a quando non avrà visti a prezzi accettabili, comunque evitate le gite da martoneti."
40,“Paseando por el agua”,"Para mí San Petersburgo siempre ha brillado con luz propia. Las excursiones en barco por sus canales son una oportunidad estupenda para conocer y contemplar los bellos perfiles de San Petersburgo desde otra perspectiva. No sabrás exactamente hacia dónde mirar, qué hacer, con qué embelesarte más, porque todo en ello es grandioso, apasionante, magnánimo…  Verlos desde la perspectiva de las aguas, y además con una guía que te va contando algunas de las historias de la ciudad, tiene su encanto y te permite aprender muchas cosas que, de otra manera, probablemente te pasasen desapercibidas.Ver los perfiles de la bella San Petersburgo bajo la luz del sol, reflejados en el agua que la envuelve en sus ríos y canales, multiplica aún más su belleza. Será ésta, una imagen que no podréis quitaros de la retina….Por ello, contemplar la perspectiva de San Petersburgo desde las aguas sigue siendo fundamental para entender y conocer esta bellísima ciudad.PD: Nosotros fuimos 10 personas y nos costó 14 € cada uno."
50,“Sankt Petersburg hautnah erleben”,"Wir kommen sozusagen ganz frisch von einer Reise aus Sankt Petersburg zurück – unserer 1. Individualreise - und wollten hier kurz unsere Begeisterung beschreiben:Wir waren zum 2. Mal im wunderschönen St. Petersburg. Diesmal im Juni, wo die Touristenschwärme noch nicht allzu groß sind und außerdem die Weißen Nächte die Silouette der Stadt in ein bezauberndes Licht tauchen, während sich allnächtlich die Menschen im Zentrum, entlang des Flusses, versammeln und alles zu einer großen Feier werden lassen.Tagsüber gibt es viel zu sehen: Sehenwürdigkeiten aus der Gründerzeit, der Zarenzeit wie aus der revolutionären und sowjetischen Epoche der Stadt. Überall gibt es Museen, Denkmäler, kleine und große Parks mit historischem Hintergrund. Ein wahres Paradies für geschichtsinteressierte Menschen. (Leider sind einige Museen etwas überladen bzw. zu groß dimensioniert, so dass man mehrere Tage braucht, um sich alles anzusehen. Aber mit der richtigen Reiseleitung ist auch das kein Problem.)Im Gegensatz zum letzten Mal, wo wir noch mit einer großen Reisegruppe festgelegte Tagespläne „abarbeiteten“ und leider einiges zu kurz kam, was wir uns gern länger angeschaut hätten, hatten wir diesmal alles über den gleichnamigen Reiseveranstalter (Petersburg hautnah) gebucht – und „hautnah“ ist wirklich das richtige Wort dafür. Neben der Unterbringung im Hotel Petropalace, mitten im Zentrum, konnten wir mit unseren Tourguides alles individuell planen und unsere Wünsche auch spontan anspassen. Sergej, als Hauptorganisator, und später seine Kollegin Marina zeigten uns neben den gängigen Attraktionen wunderschöne Orte, die in keinem Reiseführer stehen und die man als Tourist allein auch nicht entdecken würde. Darüber hinaus kamen wir dank ihrer tollen Organisation so gut wie immer um die Warteschlangen vor den Museen und Galerien herum. Und das alles war nicht viel teurer als eine Gruppenreise. Allein die freie Zeiteinteilung, die individuelle Gestaltung und das schöne Gefühl, dass sich jemand nur um uns kümmert, waren es wert.Wir würden Sankt Petersburg als Reiseziel immer wieder empfehlen und mit einer individuellen Reiseleitung wird die Stadt zum echten Erlebnis. Gut gelaunt und erholt sind wir wieder zu Hause und werden noch lange daran denken.Dank noch einmal an Sergej und Marina, unsere beiden netten Guides.Allen zukünftigen Piter-Besuchern wünschen wir eine gute Reise!Erika & Manfred BrünnPS: Weil die Frage im Freundeskreis oft gestellt wird: Was die Sicherheit angeht, hatten wir noch nie Probleme. Allerdings kamen uns im Hotel einige Geschichten über Taschendiebstähle zu Ohren. Wir waren davon nicht betroffen. Aber ganz allgemein liegen solche Erlebnisse wohl oft in der Leichtfertigkeit der Touristen begründet. In Metropolen wie Sankt Petersburg sollte man generell etwas sorgfältiger auf sein Eigentum achten und einige Sicherheitsvorkehrungen beherzigen, dann sollte auch nichts passieren."
40,“San PIetroburgo: la citta' degli Zar”,"Dal 15 al 22 giugno 2011, durante il periodo delle notti bianche, dove il sole non tramonta mai e la notte non diviene mai tale, sono stata a San Pietroburgo.Citta' affascinante, grandi le distanze anche rispetto ad una citta' come Roma; solo la strada principale del centro, la Prospettiva Nievskij e' lunga 9 km.La citta' e' piuttosto cara, rispetto a quanto mi immaginavo, ma in vacanza vale bene avere il gusto di spendere altrimenti uno se ne rimane nella propria citta', anche se il fatto che vi siano prezzi diversificati per i russi e per gli stranieri - cosa che in Italia non accade in nessun museo o altro da visitare con biglietto a pagamento - mi ha un po' lasciato dubbiosa.Comunque la citta' e' da visitare sia nei suoi musei che nei suoi palazzi reali, all'Ermitage non sai se guardare le bellezze del palazzo, oppure le innumerevoli opere d'arte.Dove volgi lo sguardo vi e' una compenetrazione della grandeur degli zar con le lore reggie ricche di stucchi e quadri e palazzi della fine ottocento-primi del novecento, lasciati un po' andare (sarebbero bellissimi restaurati).Unica pecca e' che poche persone parlano l'inglese, per cui non e' cosi' semplice chiarirsi via verbale, la gestualita' aiuta moltissimo.Ottimo il cibo, L'acqua in bottiglia e' carissima, circa 3 euro mezzo litro, per cui consiglio comperarla nei supermercati. Non e' possibile bere l'acqua del rubinetto perche' e' ferrosa e le tubature rilasciano alcune scorie, si puo' bere se bollita.C'e' molto da vedere e anche da acquistare: non facili da trovare i ""reperti"" della Russia prima della Perestrojika, Matrioske a go go, acquarelli, ovetti di legno dipinti a mano, le sigarette e le famose Papi Ross (sigarette del vecchio regime, che solo alcuni Tabaru - tabaccai hanno) nelle chiese ortodosse si possono acquistare icone moderne di vari santi e madonne - quelle antiche, e' meglio di no potrebbero farvi problemi all'aeroporto - , rosari, bibbie in russo.Insomma se volete fare un viaggio affascinanante, andateci, per visitare la citta' e qualche d'intorno basterebbero anche 5-6 giorni."
50,“St. Petersburg - die Stadt der weißen Nächte”,"Wenn man nach Sankt Petersburg reist, der Stadtgründung Zar Peters des Großen, 1703, also gerade einmal gut 300 Jahre alt, dann fällt es einem sehr schwer zu entscheiden, welches denn wohl die schönste Reisezeit für diese wunderbare Stadt für Romantiker sein könnte. Welch ein wunderbar heller Glanz umfasst diese Metropole in den äußerst langen 'weißen' Nächten im Juni und Juli, wenn man bis spät abends an der Newa entlangspazieren kann. Auf beiden Seiten bietet sich ein sehr opulentes Bild der Stadt, die im 18. Jahrhundert ihr markantes Gepräge bekam.Oder favorisiere ich doch lieber die klirrend-kalten Wintertage, mit ihrem milchigen Licht, dem Herumstapfen in Schnee und Eis, wenn die Eremitage, dieses imposante Kunstmuseum mit Weltgeltung aus dem Weiß der Umgebung hervorsticht und die Neva teilweise mit Eis bedeckt ist, das verlockend Bilder der Stadt reflektiert ?Versäumen Sie nicht den Newkji-Prosepekt entlang zu flanieren und auch einen Besuch der 'Blutkirche' (Attentat auf Zar Alexander III.) sollte man unbedingt für einen Aufenthalt in dieser faszinierenden Stadt reservieren."
40,“San Pietroburgo”,"Città affascinante. Nel periodo delle Notti bianche le innumerevoli ore di luce permettono tempi di visita estremamente prolungati: addirittura alcuni monumenti sono aperti al pubblico anche nelle ore notturne.Assolutamente da raccomandare un giro in barca lungo i canali, è un'oppotunità imperdibile per godere dello scenario mozzafiato dei palazzi che impreziosiscono la città."
50,"“SAN PIETROBURGO, CAPITALE ZARISTA”","SAN PIETROBURGO, CAPITALE ZARISTAPer essere una città di poco più di tre secoli (è stata fondata da Pietro il Grande il 27 maggio del 1703) San Pietroburgo vanta una storia eccezionalmente intensa che la ha arricchita di testimonianze architettoniche e artistiche spettacolari, tali da renderla oggi una delle città più monumentali al mondo, malgrado sia molto meno antica della Capitale russa (che risale al XII secolo) o, se è per questo, anche di New York (XVII secolo).Capitale intanto lo è stata a lungo, contendendo più volte il titolo a Mosca; mentre da sempre è la città più proiettata verso l’esterno di tutta la Russia e, conseguentemente, più colta e sofisticata. Potenzialmente più ribelle anche, e dunque guardata talvolta con sospetto dal resto del Paese. Una vera e propria “Finestra aperta sull’Occidente” anche geograficamente, come aveva intuito Pietro il Grande.Oggi, con 4,5 milioni di abitanti e la sede del colosso energetico Gazprom, è la seconda città della Russia dopo Mosca per dimensioni ed economia, mentre supera ogni altra per importanza artistico-culturale e turismo.L’aeroporto di San Pietroburgo, Pulkovo, si trova a sud della città e si raggiunge direttamente da Milano o Roma con Rossiya Airlines oppure con Aeroflot via Mosca. Non dispone, purtroppo, di collegamento su ferro (treno o metropolitana) per il centro, tuttavia una valida alternativa è il frequente servizio bus per Moskovskaia, da dove si prosegue per il centro sulla linea 2 della metropolitana.Quest’ultima rappresenta il modo più rapido, efficiente ed economico (oltrechè tipicamente russo) di girare la città e la rete è degna di lode: 5 linee, 110 km, 64 stazioni di prodigiosa ingegneria e maestosa architettura.Le banchine, tipicamente ad isola unica e profondissime, sono unite ai mezzanini da lunghissime e rapide scale mobili, gli spazi ritmati da imponenti arcate: veramente impressionante, oltrechè molto efficiente.I treni sono frequenti ma le stazioni molto distanti tra loro, in media quasi 2 km: in particolare nel centro sono piuttosto poche. Ciò tuttavia non è un problema in quanto questo si gira benissimo anche a piedi.Più problematica invece l’assenza di indicazioni non dico in inglese, ma almeno in caratteri latini.San Pietroburgo è una città sull’acqua.Il grande fiume Neva, ancorchè corto, vanta una portata d’acqua eccezionale come unico emissario del Lago Ladoga, a sua volta il più grande d’Europa e con ben 13 immissari. La città è posizionata sul suo delta sul Baltico ed è dunque attraversata da numerosi corsi d’acqua complementari e canali artificiali.Celebri il Palazzo d’Inverno, la Chiesa del Sangue Versato, la Cattedrale, la Fortezza dei SS Pietro e Paolo, il monumento equestre a Pietro il Grande, la Colonna di Alessandro. I Palazzi sono imponenti e sfarzosi, dominano il tardobarocco, l’eclettico ed il neoclassico, i colori ocra e verde pallido, i balconi e le inferriate liberty ed art-noveau, le abbondanti e splendenti decorazioni dorate.Le alte e sottili guglie delle chiese riflettono la luce che d’estate dura sin quasi a mezzanotte, i parchi sono frequenti ed estesi, l’aria spesso limpida, fresca e pulita.Passeggiare è un vero piacere.Soprattutto per Nevsky Prospekt, il viale più elegante e mondano della città, animatissimo a tutte le ore, specie durante le famose notti bianche, in giugno, quando la luce dura sino a tarda ora e non diventa mai veramente buio. Negozi di lusso, locali alla moda, alberghi blasonati, marciapiedi ampi ed affollati.E donne stupende.Le russe sono le donne più belle del mondo e quelle di San Pietroburgo le più belle della Russia.E, oltre alla bellezza, hanno un fascino, una sofisticatezza, un portamento ed un atteggiamento forte e disinvolto che ne esalta la femminilità, così tipica di questo popolo le cui donne hanno una capacità assolutamente unica nell’impegnare in essa tutto il cuore ed il cervello (quest’ultimo spesso pure notevolissimo).Ciò spiega perché, molti allegri compatrioti partiti alla volta di San Pietroburgo con superficiali intenti d’abbordaggio vacanziero ne sono tornati con la storia d’amore più importante della loro vita.In ogni caso, se siete in coppia attenti a non farvi venire il torcicollo e a non indisporre troppo la partner!La cucina russa, sostanziosa e rustica trova qui le migliori espressioni, come pure quelle caucasiche.Consigliatissimo il giro in battello su Neva e canali, che vi permetterà di cogliere al meglio gli scorci più suggestivi della città.Ricchissimi i musei, dall’Hermitage al Museo Russo, assolutamente da visitare. Cercate però di prenotare la visita per evitare le lunghe code: turisti a parte i russi sono un popolo molto più attratto dall’arte e dalla cultura degli italiani, malgrado il nostro immenso retaggio in tal senso.Da non perdere anche le escursioni ai magnifici complessi suburbani del XVIII secolo di Peterhof e Pushkin, entrambi raggiungibili facilmente in treno ma, per il primo, è vivamente consigliabile utilizzare gli aliscafi in partenza dalla sponda meridionale della Neva di fronte all’Hermitage: l’arrivo a questa residenza suburbana sul Baltico è indimenticabile. Entrambi i complessi, infatti, per grandiosità e splendore, eclissano Versailles.Unico neo, i prezzi: negli ultimi dieci anni sono cresciuti moltissimo, sin quasi agli standard occidentali, portando così non pochi scompensi sociali dato che il reddito medio non è altrettanto prossimo ai medesimi standard. Mangiare in un ristorante elegante o prendere un aperitivo in un locale alla moda non vi costerà molto meno che a Milano.Per visitare questa splendida città in maniera abbastanza completa, servono almeno tre giorni interi.San Pietroburgo è stupenda in tutte le stagioni e con tutte le condizioni metereologi che (nei casi peggiori non mancano certo musei ed architetture spettacolari da ammirare indoor) tuttavia il periodo delle Notti Bianche, il mese di giugno, rappresenta un sicuro valore aggiunto per le numerosissime ore di luce, il cielo spesso eccezionalmente limpido e sereno, la movida continua, la gente ancora più allegra e vivace."

Se servisse accanto all'hotel c'è un supermercato. La pulizia è buona. Personale molto informale. Come ristorante se possibile, da evitare. Il mangiare lascia molto a desiderare, e praticamente è lo stesso tutte le sere, salvo piccole varianti (voto 2=)"

Im Sommer ist auch der Garten im Peterhof atemberaubend...."
40,“Tolle Stadt”,"St Petersburg ist eine tolle Stadt, mit vielen Sehenswürdigkeiten wie der Auferstehungskirche oder der Isaakskathedrale mit Park.Ein ganz besonderes Erlebniss ist eine Schifffahrt, dabei fährt man ca. 1 Stunde über den Fluß und sieht von dort so gut wie alles Sehenswürdigkeiten aus schönen Perpektiven."
50,“Venedig Russlands”,"Ich war überrascht von der pitoresken und aufgeräumten Stadt. Obwohl man sich in einer Grossstadt befindet, fühlt man sich dank der vielen Kanäle und den Fluss Newa fast schon wie in Venedig. Die Leute sind freundlich, die Stadt wie gesagt sehr sauber und zumindest nach meiner Einschätzung sehr sicher."
50,“Gesamtkunstwerk”,"Über St. Petersburg zu schreiben ist eigentlich müßig, es wurde praktisch schon alles veröffentlicht. Trotzdem möchte ich eines festhalten: Ich war wirklich schon in vielen Städten der Welt, aber St. Petersburg ist atemberaubend schön, gehört sicherlich zu den absolut eindruckvollsten Städten der Welt und ist ein absolutes „MUSS“. Ich habe jedenfalls den Eindruck gewonnen, in der Gesamtbetrachtung des Altstadtensembles und der Sehenswürdigkeiten, bisher nichts Prachtvolleres gesehen zu haben. Man sollte versuchen, diese Stadt wenigstens einmal besucht zu haben. Ausdrücklich ist darauf hinzuweisen, dass die Stadt, auch für westliche Verhältnisse, nicht billig ist. Man sollte sich keine „Ostblockpreise“ erwarten – das gilt speziell, sollte jemand auf die Idee kommen, Shopping betreiben zu müssen. Da sind andere Städte der Welt natürlich unvergleichlich besser. Essen und Trinken ist zu vernünftigen Preisen möglich, wenn man ein bisschen aufpasst."
40,“Unvergessliche Erlebnisse”,"Fast alle Touristen aus dem Westen werden von dieser Stadt verzaubert, obwohl sie wegen ihrer so ganz uneinheitlichen architektonischen Vielfalt, in der zuweilen ein bisschen Kitsch nicht fehlt, auch häufig gescholten wird.Man muss zudem - wie in jeder Millionenstadt der Welt - ein wenig auf der Hut sein und die russische Bürokratie erleichtert einen Besuch auch nicht gerade.Wer aber das Glück hat, mit Einheimischen die Stadt kennen zu lernen, wird aus dieser Kapitale eine Fülle unvergesslicher Eindrücke mitnehmen, die schon die Stadt selbst, aber auch die sie umringenden sämtlich berühmten und sehenswerten Orte, wie Peterhof, Puschkin, Pawlowsk, Kronstadt usw, sie in fast erdrückender Viefalt bieten."
50,“波罗的海的明珠”,彼得堡——穿越三百年时空的矛盾之城，既体现着俄罗斯的精华、同时却又是最不俄罗斯的城市。星罗棋布的运河，潋滟的艺术之光，凡此种种皆让人不禁感叹其不愧北方威尼斯之称！
50,“浪漫的圣彼得堡”,黄昏的时候漫步在圣彼得堡，走过老旧的街道，回家的马车，仿佛生活在18世纪。典雅的冬宫、夏宫，金碧辉煌，尤其夏宫的喷泉，也很让人折服古代人的智慧。
40,“St. Petersburg - schöne Ostseemetropole”,"St. Petersburg zeigte sich im März noch von seiner winterlichen Seite, während im übrigen Europa schön in weiten Bereichen der Frühling eingekehrt war. Die Ostsee, die Neva sowie die Kanäle waren noch tief zugefroren während auf den Strassen der Stadt hiervon nichts zu spüren war. Die Hauptstrasse (der Nevski Prospekt) ist gesäumt von diversen Einkaufszentren und Shopping-Malls. Direkt an der Neva viele besondere historische Gebäude und Plätze sowie das Schlachtschiff Aurora aus dem 1. Weltkrieg. Die Fahrtzeit aus dem Zentrum bis zum Pulkovo Airport beträgt je nach Verkehrslage zwischen 45 und 90 Minuten. In der Stadt viele schöne Restaurants und Cafes."
50,“La città dello Zar”,"La Venezia del Nord.La città sorge e si sviluppa lungo il fiume Neva, un fiume completamente ghiacciato d'inverno ma che offre possibilità di stupende escursioni durante gli altri periodi dell'anno.Dal fiume partono numerosi battelli verso i giardini più famosi dell'area, in particolare quelli di Petherof, dove è possibile ammirare delle splendide fontane e giochi acquatici.E' una città ricca di monumenti e musei famosi in tutto il mondo.Il Museo dell'Ermitage è la maggior attrazione ed al suo interno ci sono alcuni dei più preziosi dipinti al mondo.Da non perdere: La Chiesa sul Sangue Versato"
50,“Venezia del Nord? NO! Semplicemente San Pietroburgo”,"San Pietroburgo è una città meravigliosa, una vera e propria perla rara di inestimabile valore.Molto diversa da Mosca ma per certi versi addirittura molto più vivibile perché meno caotica e più economica.Il periodo consigliato a tutti per visitarla è certamente quello estivo, preferibilmente giugno, in quanto il caldo e il sole aiutano nelle innumerevoli passeggiate tra i canali della città. Inoltre questo periodo è caratterizzato dalle ""notti bianche"", ossia quelle notti nelle quali l'oscurità non prende mai il sopravvento sulla luce. Le vie si riempiono di gente i negozi e i locali del grande centro restano sempre aperti hli innumerevoli ponti e ponticelli vengono illuminati ed è pura magia!!!Certamente da visitare il famoso museo de l'Hermitage, il palazzo di inverno e il muoseo nazionale russo per ammirarne la bellezza e i capolavori. Il Nevskiy Prospect è il cuore, l'arteria vitale della città.Il periodo invernale o più in generale il periodo che va da ottobre ad aprile è decisamente freddo (temperature mai al di sopra dei -5!), nevica costantemente e le ore di luce, consideranto l'alta latitudine sono davvero poche. Tuttavia, anche d'inverno sotto una fitta nevicata la città non perde affatto il suo fascino.Hotel molti, non proprio a buon mercato ma con servizio eccellente. Come in tutta la Russia il servizio è straordinario ed il cliente viene davvero trattato al meglio in ogni luogo."
50,“MAGICA SAN PIETROBURGO”,"San Pietroburgo è una città di strabiliante bellezza. Dal punto di vista culturale è immensa!!!! E,,,poi a luglio...le notti bianche!!!! E' incredidile!!!! alle due di notte è come se fosse crepuscolo da noi!!!! Peccato che in una settimana non ho imparato a dire altro che ""DA"", è una cosa vergognosa ma il russo è difficilissimo!!!"
50,“MERAVIGLIOSA”,"Ci sono stato a Settembre per una convention aziendale, ho soggiornato per 4 giorni. Chiaramente, come in tutti i viaggi per lavoro con clienti, ho potuto vivere un'esperienza che non avrei potuto permettermi con le mie risorse.La città è bellissima, ha circa 300 anni di storia, la zona centrale è stata costruita quasi interamente da architetti europei. Si potrebbe quasi dire che, vedendo solo il centro, tappandosi le orecchie e non guardando le scritte in cirillico, sembrerebbe quasi di essere in Europa, diciamo a metà tra Vienna e Praga. Ho avuto la fortuna di alloggiare nei pressi dell' Hermitage, penso uno dei musei più imponenti d'Europa, assolutamente da visitare. Non parliamo poi delle residenze imperiali, di una bellezza incredibile.Vi consiglio vivamente un giro in barca per i canali della città, veramente incantevole.La moneta è il rublo, nella zona centrale viene accettato anche l'euro, ma nella maggior parte dei posti, specialmente nei locali non del centro, vi risulterà impossibile pagare, anche con carte, se non in moneta locale.La vita notturna è ottima, il mio consiglio è comunque quello di rimanere nella zona centrale in quanto la parte periferica, oltre a non essere bella, mi è parsa anche poco sicura.La città è attraversata dal fiume, ad una certa ora nella notte i ponti vengono aperti per il passaggio delle navi e, se dovete ritornare dall'altra sponda, diventa un problema, quindi regolatevi.Posto qualche foto, assolutamente da visitare!"
50,“la città più bella dell'est”,"San Pietroburgo è senz'altro una delle città più belle che io abbia mai visto!Totalmente costruita da architetti italiani e olandesi è facilmente visitabile a piedi. In ogni angolo della città troverete qualcosa da vedere o da fotografare o semplicemente da osservare. il centro non è grandissimo, ma ha una grandissima concentrazione di chiese, strade, negozi, monumenti impossibili da non notare.più in periferia, a una trentina di chilometri dal centro, è possibile ammirare le ex residenze degli zar, di una bellezza unica!oltre all'eleganza, alla bellezza e all'ospitalità, San Pietroburgo offre molto anche nel dopo cena. Locali e discoteche alla moda la fanno da padroni.Ideale come meta di coppia, san pietroburgo è una città davvero romantica. Allo stesso tempo è perfetta per un viaggio culturale o anche di piacere.Sarà sicuramente stupendo passaggiare per la via principale, la prospettiva Nevskiy. Ma consiglio di farlo nei mesi estivi: l'inverno e la sua rigidità sono l'unico aspetto negativo di questa splendida città."
50,“St. Petersburg - Die Stadt am Wasser”,"St. Petersburg ist eine sehr schöne Stadt, dierket am Wasser gelegen. Auf Grund der vielen Kanäle nennt man St. Petersburg auch das Venedig des Nordens. Besonders sehenswert sind die Eremitage sowie die Auferstehenungskirche. Auf jeden Fall sollte man auch über den Nevski Prospekt spazieren. Hier gibt es zahlreiche Geschäfte und Hotels."
40,“eine der sehenswerten Städte Russlands”,"St. Petersburg ist die zweitgrößte Stadt Russlands und damit auch ein reizendes weltbekanntes Reiseziel. Die Stadt liegt an mehreren Flüssen und Inseln, deswegen nennt man sie auch manchmal „Venedig des Nordens“.Das historische Zentrum ist wirklich groß und umfasst ca. 4 – 5 U-Bahn Stationen (nicht unterschätzen, eine U-Bahn Station geht man ca. 30-40 min zu Fuß). Zu den „Musts“ würde ich nennen: Ermitage, Kasaner Kathedrale, Peters-Paul Festung, Isaak-Kathedrale, Russisches Museum, Blutskirche. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten sind von einander ziemlich entfernt, deswegen würde ich dafür ca. 3 Tage reservieren.Im Zentrum sind öfters heftige Staus, besonders in der „rusch hour“, deswegen ist es am besten die U-Bahn Verbindung zu benutzen, ansonsten lieber zu Fuß, da man von der Stadt so mehr bekommt. Es sind richtig viele alte Häuser im Zentrum erhalten.Sehenswert sind auch die ganzen Vororten von St. Petersburg, wo früher die Zaren und Fürsten ihre Paläste hatten: Puschkin mit dem Bernsteinzimmer, Peterhof mit seinen Fontänen im wunderschönem Park, Gatchina, Pavlovsk. Für jeden solchen Besuch soll man auch noch einen kompletten Tag zur Verfügung haben."
50,“No more Leningrad”,"Wir kommen mit dem Bus aus Estland in St. Petersburg an: Die allerersten Eindrücke sind sowjetisch angehaucht - Arbeiterdenkmal, der Name Leningrad in kyrillischer Schrift auf dem Dach eines Hochhauses. Aber dann nehmen uns doch die stattlichen Fassaden an den breiten und schön angelegten Prospekten mit Beschlag - die Brücken über das Wasser der Neva, die Parks, die Prunkbauten. In der Dämmerung strahlen aus dem winterlichen Weiss die angestrahlten Mauern und Zwiebeltürme orthodoxer Kirchen. Putin hat die Stadt renovieren lassen, was ihr sichtlich gut getan hat. Am nächsten Morgen pilgern wir zur grün gestrichenen Hermitage - die Kunstsammlung ist überwältigend, man müßte ein paar Tage dort verbringen, um einen umfassenden Eindruck zu gewinnen.Ein weiterer Höhepunkt ist der Besuch im Katharinenschloss - durch Prunksäle wandelt man, bis man plötzlich im Bernsteinzimmer steht - die Wände sind in Bernstein verziert - cognacfarben, goldgelb, grün und alle Schattierungen dazwischen. Auch die vier Mosaikbider, um die sich - ebenso wie um das Bernsteinzimmer selbst - Legenden ranken, sind sehenswert. Im verschneiten Park paradiert dann eine Kompanie Soldaten,Allzu schnell ist die Zeit verflogen - schon fährt der Bus zurück über Narva nach Tallinn."
50,“a faire en hiver”,ville découverte sous son manteau blanc. Palais d'été (à l'exterieur de la ville) splendides sous la neige et le soleil.Musée de l'Hermitage à faire ainsi qu'un ballet au Mariinsky.Impression curieuse de marcher sur la Neva gelée et de voir les canaux tout blanc.
50,“HERRSCHAFTLICH VERSCHNEIT: WUNDERSCHÖN”,"St. Petersburg ist im Sommer atemberaubend schön. Während der Weissen Nächte wunderschön, allerdings ungleich überfüllter. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten, die Restaurants, die Hotels - überall nur Drängelei und schnelle Abfertigung..Völlig anders im Winter!!! Die Stadt verschneit zu erleben lässt sie in strahlendem Weiss freundlicher erscheinen, alles ist hell, selbst die bröckelnden Fassaden wirken herrschaftlich.In den Restaurants wird man nicht erst in der 3. Sitzung abgefertigt, sondern man kann in Ruhe wählen und geniessen. Selbst in der Eremitage ist Ruhe eingekehrt, man kann neben den erlesenen Kunstwerken den Prachtbau in seiner gigantischen Erscheinung bewundern.Ich habe St. Petersburg nie so schön erlebt wie im Winter, auch die umliegenden Schlösser in ihren prachtvollen Parks ( Schlittenfahrte ein must do ) versetzen den Besucher in die alte Zarenzeit."
50,“ロシア帝国の栄華を誇る。”,ロシア帝国の歴史が凝縮された大きな町です。エカテリーナ宮殿の琥珀の間は想像通り、すべて琥珀で埋め尽くされた贅沢な部屋（撮影禁止）でした。ピョートル大帝夏の宮殿は池や噴水の水との調和が美しい宮殿です。エルミタージュ美術館は「世界三大美術館」のひとつといわれるだけのことはあります。一見の価値あり。
50,“我用双脚丈量彼得圣城”,听说圣彼得堡真正阳光灿烂的日子一年之中就只有不超过60天，所以趁着盛夏来到了这座彼得的圣城，却赶上了130多年来的最炎热的一个夏天，北极圈上的气温高达30多摄氏度。与莫斯科的俄罗斯风情不同，圣彼得堡是典型的北欧城市。站在瓦西里耶夫斯基岛上沿涅瓦河望去，圣彼得堡就像一幅油画，斑驳忧伤，满目都是巴洛克式和欧洲古典建筑风格的圆顶建筑。远眺彼得保罗大教堂的尖顶，庄严肃穆并且辉煌，静静地守护着彼得圣城。在钢琴声中漫步在圣彼得堡的街上，运河交错，到处都是纪念碑、教堂、高等学府等著名的古典建筑。从圣伊萨克大教堂、喀山大教堂到冬宫，从叶卡捷琳娜二世纪念馆、俄罗斯大剧院到国家博物馆，就像走在一幅生活的俄罗斯历史画卷中。
50,“Kultur pur & Wunderschön”,"Wer sich für Geschichte und Kultur interessiert, ist hier richitg. Es ist eine sehr schöne Stadt, in der es an JEDER Ecke etwas Schönes und Interessantes zu entdecken gibt. Wir waren 10 Tage dort und haben jeden Tag intensiv genutzt, dennoch hätte man noch 3-4 Tage dranhängen können.Einen Tag sollte man auf jeden Fall der Eremitage widmen. Wenn man sich in Ruhe alles anschauen möchte, wären evtl. sogar 2 Tage besser. Nicht nur die riesige Kunstsammlung ist ein Schatz, sondern die Räume selbst sind einfach unglaublich schön und faszinierend.Ein weiteres Muss und ein Tagesausflug ist natürlich auch der Peterhof: insbesondere die Wasserbrunnen sind beeindruckend. Überall plätschert das Wasser, die Blumenanlagen und der Park sind einfach toll und laden zum Entspannen ein.Auch wenn die Preise etwas hoch sind, es lohnt sich!Vor allem im Sommer sollte man sich überall auf lange Warteschlangen einstellen -> also früher kommen!"
50,“Die schönste Stadt Russlands”,"St. Petersburg ist die schönste Stadt Russlands mit vielen kulturellen Angeboten. Ein Muss stellen dabei die Eremitage, der Katharinenpalast und Peterhof dar. Besonders während der Sommersonnenwende lohnt sich ein Stadtbesuch, da es dann selbst um Mitternacht noch hell ist. Auch das Hochklappen der Brücken und das Einfahren der Schiffe in der Nacht ist sehenswert."
50,“Kultur Pur”,"Beeindruckende Stadt mit unglaublich vielen Kulturschätzen und Sehenswürdigkeiten.Must See: Katharinen Palast in Zarsko Selo, Hermitage Museum (online mindestens 4 Tage vor Besuch Karten reservieren sonst wartet man in sehr langen Warteschlangen).Wer im November und den WIntermonaten fährst sollte die Eiseskälte nicht unterschätzen!Wunderschön auch die Kirchen und das Marinskii Theater wo eine Balettvorführung sich unbedingt empfiehlt.Wie haben alle Ausflüge vor Ort bei unabhängigern Touroperators, die man in Buden am Nevski Prospect findet gebucht und lagen damit preislich viel besser als das gleiche im Hotel gebucht zu haben. Achtung - wenige sprechen hier Englisch. Bevor man sich abmüht am besten sofort fragen ob man in Englisch verstanden wird.UBahn fahren muss man in ST Petersburg mal gemacht haben, um das alte U Bahn System dort gesehen zu haben, sonst ist es aber wenig spektakulär. Wenn man mit dem Bus fährt sollte man ein Zettel mit daraufgeschriebener Adresse haben, sonst wird man nicht verstanden.Wir fanden es absolut empfehlenswert wenn man sich für ein Kultur City Trip begeistern kann."

30,“サンクトペテルブルクの町並み”,サンクトペテルブルグは、モスクワに続く大都市ですが、より洗練されています。ただ、共産主義が長かったせいか観光客へのサービスに関してはまだまだ改善する点がありますね。それと英語があまり通じない国なので言葉が喋れないと少し苦労しますね。やはり、団体ツアーで行く方がいいのかな、という気がします。　気がついた点をいくつか書きます。　悪い点は、サービス、接客、物価の高さ（マックでも日本より高いくらいです）、地下鉄駅や地下通路の暗さなどです。　良い点は、町並みが綺麗でヨーロッパの雰囲気ですね。モスクワと比較しても綺麗です。また、エルミタージュやその他歴史的な建物などがかなりあることです。冬はとても寒い国なので、ツアーで真夏に行くのがいいのかな、と思います。
40,“Venedig des Nordens”,"St. Petersburg ist eine wunderschöne Stadt die man unbedingt gesehen haben sollte. Die Prachtbauten aus der Zarenzeit sind trotz der nicht zu übersehenden Baufälligkeit und des Mangels an Pflege sehr beeindruckend, wobei man anmerken muss, dass ein Großteil der Gebäude, besonders jene mit touristischer Bedeutung, bereits saniert sind. Allerdings muss man wissen, dass die Stadt ein extrem teures Pflaster ist und man als Tourist immer in eine ""Sonderpreiskategorie"" eingeornet wird.Ein sehr schönes (und kostenloses) Ereignis ist die nächtliche Öffnung der Neva-Brücken."
50,“Im Sommer wie im Winter eine Reise wert”,"Die ehemalige Zarenstadt St. Petersburg ist zu jeder Jahreszeit eine Reise wert. Ich selbst hatte bisher sowohl im Sommer als auch im Winter das Vergnügen.Der herrvorrgend erhaltene historische Stadtkern mit einer vielzahl von Museen ( das bekannteste mit Sicherheit die Hermitage) und die Peter & Paul Festung, ermöglicht auch im Winter bzw. wenn es regnet ein schönes und auserordentliches Programm.In der näheren Umgebung von St. Petersburg befindet sich das prunkvolle Schloss Peterhof, welches vor allem im Sommer zu empfehlen ist, das der große Schlossgarten eine vielzahl von schönen Brunnen zu bieten hat. Man kann das Schloss sowohl mit de Boot als auch mit dem Bus erreichen. Ein weiteres Ausflugsziel ist die Festung""halbinsel"" Kronstadt auf welcher immernoch ein Teil der Ostseeflotte Russland stationiert ist. Der Besuch dieser alten Festung fühlt sich wie einer Reise in der frühe Sowjetunion an.Wenn man die Zeit hat sollte man auch eine Stadtrundfahrt mit dem Boot unternehmen. Hier gibt es eine Vielzahl von Möglichkeiten wie ein Exclusivtrip für Paare oder aber auch ein ""normales"" großeres Schiff.Wie in allen Großstädten sollte man sich auch in St. Peterbrug besonders vor Taschendieben hüten, welche doch in großer Anzahl auftreten.St. Petersburg ist gut und günstig durch Billigflieger wie Germanwings / Air Berlin erreichbar. Wenn man bereits in Russland ist bietet sich die Zugfahrt ab Moskau (über Nacht) für ab ca. 30 €, oder die etwas teuerere aber wesentlich schneller Fahrt mit dem Sapsan an. Weiterhin kann man auch von Moskau günstig mit Avianova, Aeroflot oder Rossia nach St. Petersburg fliegen. Ein direkter Zug fährt neu von Helsinki und von Tallin bestehen günstige Busverbindungen ab 20 €."
50,“Zu empfehlen: Das Venedig des Nordens”,"Der St. Petersburger Flughafen Pulkovo war von Berlin aus in ca. zwei Stunden erreicht. Wir wohnten im Hotel Azimut und sind zu Fuß vom baltischen Bahnhof aus hingegangen. Die U-Bahnen liegen in St. Peterburg sehr tief, da die Stadt auf Sumpfgebiet erbaut wurde und erst tief unten ausreichend fester Boden ist. Sehr prächtig anzusehen, vor allem bei Sonnenuntergang, war die Kirche ""Erlöser auf dem Blute“. Besonders beeindruckend ist die Eremitage, in der sich ein Kunstmuseum befindet. Eine weitere wichtige Sehenswürdigkeit ist die Peter-und-Paul-Festung, darin sind: historische Gebäude, Ausstellungen, Museen und Denkmäler. Mir schmeckte in St. Petersburg gut: Borschtsch (Rote-Rüben-Suppe), Hering, Piroschki und пиво (pivo = Bier)."
40,“c'est magique!!!”,je reviens de 3 jours à Saint Petersbourg..je reste encore sous l'empreinte de tout ce que j'ai vuc'est ultra dépaysant...je recommande cette expérience!
50,“双重圣彼得堡”,与圣彼得堡结缘是意料之外的事情。一直以来很想去莫斯科，想到红场听钟声，在列宁山逛莫大。来到圣彼得堡以后，就把莫斯科抛在了脑后。莫斯科被俄罗斯人称为大农村，而圣彼得堡则有那一份精致，换而言之，在经历了种种以后，它依旧是彼得的城，是那个通向欧洲的窗口，是贵族的城。度过令人发狂的泥泞的潮湿的寒冷的易抑郁的冬季以后，圣彼得堡的阳光灿烂让人体会不到一丝含蓄。就仿佛冷冰冰的女王突然对你大献殷情一般。喀山教堂前裸露的人群，的确，这阳光弥足珍贵。伊萨基大教堂，溅血大教堂，阳光下绽放的色彩至今扔描刻在我的脑海中。你可以坐在涅瓦大街上，来一杯costa咖啡，这里不是意大利，俄罗斯姑娘在阳光下绽放迷人光彩，咖啡也愈发香浓。你可以造访普希金、陀思妥耶夫斯基、帕斯捷尔纳克的故居，这个寒冷的国度造就了许多蜚声世界的大文豪。你可以坐上最富俄罗斯特色的电气火车，去巴甫洛夫斯科，去皇村。你永远不会失望，因为那里用最富饶的大自然，俄罗斯风景画般令人痴迷的景色。俄罗斯艺术家、作家创作的不竭源泉，就是来自这篇厚重的土地，那片美丽的森林。
50,“St. Petersburg Russland”,Ein sehr schöne Stadt in der sich in den letzten Jahren sehr viel getan hat. Viele tolle und schöne Sehenswürdigkeiten.Viel Kultur.
50,“UNE MERVEILLE”,"Ville MAGNIFIQUE avec des monuments qui sont unémerveillement pour la vue.La population est accueillante contrairement à ce que l'on dit.Seul reproche l'aéroport indigne d'une telle ville,sale et trop petit."
50,“Erwartungen Ubertroffen”,"St Petersburg.Wir sind mit hohen Erwartungen nach St. Petersburg gekommen aufgrund vieler positiver Empfehlungen. Dies wurde alles übertroffen! Interesse an russischer Geschichte hilft natürlich, ebenfalls die Lektüre über die beiden Zaren Dynastien im Vorfeld. Überwältigende Vielfalt an Palästen und Kirchen mit vergoldeten Kuppeln, Decken, Wänden und ausgestattet mit vergoldeten Statuen und natürlich, nicht zu vergessen, das Hermitage Museum.Grosse Gruppen verursachen lange Wartezeiten, doch mit einer kleinen Gruppe von weniger als 15 Personen unter fachkundiger Anleitung lässt sich die Besichtigung der zahllosen Räumlichkeiten leichter bewältigen und die Eindrücke können intensiver wirken.Bedauerlich ist die Dominanz der Autos in der Stadt und Sorgen macht der Erhalt der Kunstschätze in der Zukunft bei den hohen Besucherzahlen. Also, schnell hin!3 Tage ist Minimum, wir gehen noch einmal eine Woche hin."
50,“De crucero por el mar Báltico”,"Esta ciudad sorprende al turista con multitud de atracciones turísticas, su rio y sus canales.Si llegais en crucero atravesaréis la zona portuaria que mantiene algunas instalaciones de la era soviética de aspecto lamentables.Recordad que es necesario visado para desembarcar. La opción más interesante es haber contratado previamente con alguna agencia oficial de viajes rusa las excursiones a realizar. Te envían el visado (el voucher de la excursión) que te permite desembarcar tranquilamente junto con el pasaporte en vigor. No hace falta nada más.Estas agencias tiene establecida la hora de acceso a los museos, por lo que te ahorras las larguísimas colas existentes.Es muy importante recalcar que el lunes cierran todos los museos excepto el palacio de Catalina. Esto produce unas aglomeraciones bárbaras en dicho palacio cada lunes.Imprescindible las visitas al Hermitage, Iglesia de la sangre derramada, Fortaleza de San Pedro y San Pablo, Palacio de Catalina y Peterhof, además de navegar por los canales y por el río Neva. También es interesante ver el metro que transcurre a una profundidad considerable.Todo esto además de muchísimas más posibilidades."
20,“San Petersburgo y viaje en tren a Moscú.”,"Este verano hicimos un tour comprado en el Corte Ingles de 10 dias a San Petersburgo y Moscú que en teoria está todo incluido y a la hora de la verdad, varías de las excursiones indispensables no estan incluidos (Peterhof, Yusupov, San Isaac etc). Lo peor es que no te avisan de los carteristas que abundan como chinches y actuan en plan mafia, al parecer en contubernio con la policia, en nuestro grupo a varios nos robaron la cartera. Denunciarlo es casi imposible (todo el sistema trata que no pongas la denuncia) y si a pesar de ello lo haces es posible que te traten de sacar algo mas de dinero en la propia comisaria (hay que verla, he estado en paises del 3er mundo con comisarias mas dignas...).En fin, por otro lado nos venden el viaje de SP a Moscú en tren como un gran cosa, el viaje no merece la pena, no ves nada ya que es de noche, el aire acondicionado solo funciona (no sabemos aun porque) cuando el tren está en marcha por lo que si te toca ola de calor (que nos pasó) a sudar como gorrinos la hora que te hacen estar antes de la salida y luego en cada parada. Recomendación: ir en el tren rápido por la tarde (una especie de AVE, aunque tampoco es muy seguro ya que a unos compañeros que lo habian reservado lo anularon y al final tuvieron que venir con nosotros), o lo mejor ir en avión y santas pascuas."
50,“耶酥复活教堂”,2007年来到圣彼得堡，寒冷的冬季，冷冷的冬夜里面去造访耶酥复活教堂。时间太晚了，没有得以进去，只是和游伴们在四周观赏了许久，真的是很令人屏住呼吸的感觉。其实我们刚刚进完特意找到的鱼子酱的晚餐，才得知这个也叫做溅血的救世主教堂，仰望它是那么的高，大概有八十米，上有五光十色的洋葱头顶，教堂轮廓魅力，装饰花花绿绿，与古老的俄罗斯风格与附近的古典建筑物形成鲜明的对比。真的看不出为什么在周围那么凝重氛围内有这么一座庞大而深邃的建筑，也许它正是真正历史见证的遗骸了，很重很重。。。离开时，只是按动了快门记录下它深邃的影子。。。下次一定要在个明媚的白天再次造访！
40,“Venedig des Ostens”,"Schon dier Anflug war ein Highlight. Tief ueber dem finnischen Meerbusen mit Sicht auf die Insel Kronstadt. Danach wartete das Appartment von CityRealtiy am Newski auf uns. Der Klub Honey Money war das erste, Marstall (Koneshno Dvor) das zweite Ziel. Am nächsten Morgen die Kunstmeile von der Ermitage über die Kirche Spilled blood zum Singer Haus und - wie es sich am Wochenende für alle gehört- dem Newski Prospekt mit Cafes und Bilderständen vorbei. Wetter formidabel - nur die Gastropreise etwas hoch - es lohnt sich auch hier etwas abseits zu essen (Time out, Honeymoney als Studentenbeiz und Klub im Arbat). Rundum Excellentes Wochenende."
50,“Die schönste Stadt Russlands”,Nach einer Reise mit der Transsibirischen Eisenbahn war St. Petersburg der gelungene Abschluss. Die schönste Stadt in Russland mit einem europäischen Flair. Trotz hoher Eintrittspreise sind besonders auch die Palastanlagen im Umfeld empfehlenswert - voran der Peterhof und das Bernsteinzimmer im Katharinenpalast.
40,“Ciudad Imperial”,"Hemos pasado 4 días en San Peters, y a pesar de haber sufrido una ola de calor impresionante, nos ha encantado.Es una ciudad para pasearla e ir descubriendo cada rincón.Por la ciudad te puedes mover en autobus preferentemente, porque el metro tiene pocas paradas en el centro, y los autobuses funcionan muy bien: los billetes los pagas cuando se te acerca el cobrador una vez iniciado el viaje.Imprescindible el Ermitage (recomiendo sacar la entrada por internet para no tener que guardar cola y entrar directamente por la puerta de la izquierda) y Peterhof. Y también la Iglesia de la Sangre Derramada (interiores completamente recubiertos de mosaicos), bueno y muchas cosas másEn relación a Peterhof, había leído que había mucha confusión pues si decidías ir allí cogiendo el hydrofoil se entra directamente por los jardines de abajo y que si después querías visitar los de arriba ya no te dejaban entrar para volver a coger el barco. En nuestro caso no fue así: cuando quisimos ver los jardines de arriba lo comentamos con la seguridad de la puerta y nos dijo que no había problema y pudimos entrar de nuevo. Para la visita al palacio, si no tienes la entrada, no tienes que ponerte en la cola, sino entrar directamente para sacar los billetes y una vez que los tienes te pones en la cola para entrar...Es caro, muy caro para los bolsillos europeos/españoles."
40,“eine der schönsten Städte in Europa”,"Die durchgeführte Studienreise mit Marco Polo u. a.mit einem 3tägigen Aufenthalt in St. Petersburg warein voller Erfolg. Der Aufenthalt in einem sehr zentralgelegenen Hotel Sonya war ausgezeichnet, ebensodie Küche in diesem Hotel. Das angebotene Programmwar ebenfalls sehr überzeugend, aber auch sehr zeit-intensiv und anstrengend."
40,“Sommertraum in Russland”,"Im Sommer eine Reise wert, falls es regnet stehen viele Museen und Paläste zum Besichtigen zur Verfügung, bei schönem Wetter glitzert es golden und die Kanäle und Flüsse laden zur Bootsfahrt ein.Nicht verpassen die Brückenöffnungen nachts, am Besten von der Newa aus verfolgen."
50,“Historische Stadt”,"Die schönsten Nächte sind die weissen Nächte.Wegen der Lage der Stadt am hohen Breitengrad, schafft es die Sonne nicht eine Totaldunkelheit zu schaffen. Dämmerung verschmilzt in Dämmerung, ein silbriges blaues Glühen geht auch.Diese unheimliche Beleuchtung zieht Touristen von der ganzen Welt an, die auf die Straßen zusammen mit den Ortsansässigen gehen, um eine Vielfalt an Unterhaltung und das gegenseitiges fröhliches Gemüt zu genießen. Diese Feier der Weissen Nächte dauert an über ungefähr zwei Wochen, von Ende Juni bis Anfang/Mitte Juli.Prunkvolle Paläste, prächtig schimmernde Hausfassaden, geschwungene Brücken, vergoldete Kuppeln und Turmspitzen strahlen den ehemaligen Prunk und Pomp und prägen gleichzeitig den Charme der Stadt.Die Petersburger bezeichnen ihre Stadt als Hauptstadt der Kultur. Mit ihren zahlreichen Museen, allen voran die berühmten Sammlungen der Eremitage mit ihren unermesslichen Kunstschätzen, ist die Stadt eines der schönsten und bedeutendsten Kulturzentren der Welt. Nicht nur das Stadtbild von St. Petersburg trägt unverwechselbar europäische Züge, auch das Musikleben hat sich immer wieder den Kulturen des Westens geöffnet, was in Russland durchaus nicht immer selbstverständlich war.Sankt Petersburg hat eine der tiefstgelegensten U-Bahn-Systeme der Welt, die man erleben muss.Essen und Getränke gibt es genügend, was ich mir allerdings nicht engehen lassen konnte war ein Schwäbisches Restaurant (Schwabski Domik) Schwäbische Küche mit Alpirsbacher Klosterbräu."
40,“Weltstadt mit viel Russland auf dem zweiten Blick”,"Sankt Petersburg erscheint einem auf dem ersten Blick wie eine typische westliche Weltstadt - viele Touristen und viele herausragende Sehenswürdigkeiten; teure Modeläden und teure Autos u.s.w. Auf dem zweiten Blick hält die Stadt aber auch (noch) viel Russisches versteckt bereit - die Mütterchen auf den Obst- und Gemüseständen, die jungen Frauen in extremen Absatzschuhen, die U-Bahn-Stationen in Sowjetarchitektur, drängelnde Menschen und und und ... Mittlerweile kann man sich in der Stadt auch ganz gut ohne Russischkenntnisse zurechtfinden, weil Straßennamen und U-Bahn-Stationen auch in lateinischer Schrift ausgewiesen sind. Die Menschen sprechen aber nur sehr eingeschränkt Englisch, so dass man mit zumindest rudimentären Russischkenntnissen sicher besser zu Recht kommt. Was der Stadt fehlt, ist eine ruhige Fußgängerzone. In Sachen Restaurants kann ich die vielen Cafeterias empfehlen. Dort kann man sich das Essen selbst zusammenstellen und bezahlt nach Gewicht. Sie sind günstig, man bekommt typisch russisches Essen und meist schmeckt das Essen auch gut."
40,“Magnifique”,"Le métro de Saint-Pétersbourg est étonnant dans le sens où on ne s'attend pas à une telle magnificence. Les stations sont vraiment très belles, aussi bien du point de vue architectural que du point de vue mobilier.[...]"
50,“Eine Stadt mit Charme”,"St. Petersburg - eine Stadt von Freiheit und Geschichte.Alleine die Schrift ist ein Grund zum Besuch dieser wunderbaren Stadt. Sie wird auch nicht umsonst Venedig des Nordens genannt, denn St. Petersburg ist voll mit Brücken, Flüssen und Bächen. Man sollte sich aber auf jeden Fall gutes Schuhwerk mitnehmen, denn die Wege sind extrem weit in dieser Stadt. Es gibt zwar genügend U-Bahn- und Busstationen, dennoch wird man von dem ein oder anderen Fußmarsch nicht verschont bleiben.Man kann diese Stadt trotzdem nur weiter empfehlen, man sollte sich nur im Vorhinein ein wenig mit der kyrillischen Schrift auseinandersetzen."
50,“Pietro il Grande era proprio un grande !”,"Bellissima città, tutta da visitare.L'unica cosa che non si capisce è perchè le automobili e le moto sfrecciano per le vie del centro ( e anche in periferia immagino ) ad una velocità pazzesca senza che nessuno intervenga."
40,“St. Petersburg nicht ohne Rubel”,"Wir besuchten im Juni St. Petersburg im Rahmen einer Kreuzfahrt und hatten Glück mit dem Wetter. Sonnenschein von früh bis spät abends.Wenn man mit dem Kreuzfahrtsschiff ankommt, liegt man auf einer neuen, speziell für Kreuzfahrtstouristen erreichteten Sandinsel. Beim ersten Anblick glaubt man in den Emiraten gelandet zu sein. Sand, Sand und am Horizont hohe Neubauten. 2 Dinge sind für diese Stadt sehr wichtig.1. Reisen sie nie ohne Rubel in der Tasche. Niemand (nicht einmal die öffentlichen Toiletten) nehmen Euros oder Dollars.Unsere Stadtrundfahrt, die wir an Bord gebucht hatten, führte uns in einer 1/2 Stunde dauernden Busfahrt vom Hafen durch die neuerbauten Mietshäuser direkt in Zentrum ans Ufer der Newa. Erster Höhepunkt war der Winterpalast, Zarensitz von Elisabeth I bis zu Nikolaus II. Von aussen macht das riesige Gebäude einen sehr gepflegten Eindruck. Innen darf man nicht genauer hinschauen, da gibt es etliche Mängel. Vor der St. Isaak Kathedrale die nach 40 Jahren Bauzeit 1858 fertiggestellt wurde, (erinnert an den Petersdom) herrscht stärkster Großstadtverkehr, sodaß man einige Geduld braucht um vom Reiterstandbild des Zaren Nikolaus I. hinüber zur St. Isaak Kathedrale zu kommen. Ein weiterer Höhepunkt ist der Kreuzer Aurora, mit dessen ersten (Blind-)schuß die Oktoberrevolution (1917) ausgelöst wurde.Bei Ausflügen die das Kreuzfahrtschiff veranstaltet erspart man sich das Russlandvisum. Unbedingt sollte man Rubel bei sich haben. Alle Eintritttsgebühren sind in Rubel zu entrichten. Wer keine Rubel bei sich hat, muß draussen bleiben oder an einer der offiziellen Wechselstuben (wenn geöffnet) zur ungünstigen Kurs wechseln. Wir waren leider nur 1 Tag in St. Petersburg. Um wirklich alles zu sehen, sind mind. 3 volle Tage ( besser 5 ) erforderlich. Von der Gastronomie ist nicht allzuviel zu erwarten. Hier spürt man noch immer den UDSSR Standard."
30,“Eine Stadt im Nordwesten Russlands mit vielen Schlossen”,"Nach St. Petersburg kann man mit Flugzeug, mit Schiff oder Eisenbahn aus Baltikum kommen. Die im sumpfigen Mundung von Fluss Neva auf Holzpfählen im Westlichen Stihl gebaut würde. Man könnte die Schlosse nicht nur von außen genießen, sondern auch die sind mit Kulturschätzen aus ganz Europa auch von innen gefühlt. Man muss aber natürlich auf Budget achten, um Reisekasse nicht unnötig zu plündern."
50,“mein Favorit in Rußland”,"Eine sehr schöne StadtEs gibt viele Sehenswürdigkeiten (Museen, Architektur, usw.)Und besonders weiße Nächte"
40,“美しい街です”,ヨーロッパに近く、ロシアの首都であったこともあることから、洗練された美しさが町全体に漂っています。特に、エルミタージュ美術館は数日かけないと見ることができません。ガイドさんを頼むことを絶対お勧めします。ガイドさんがいるとすんなり入場でき、見どころを抑えていますので短時間であっても、満足度は高いです。夜のライトアップされた街もまたとても素敵です。モスクワが純粋なロシアであれば、サンクトペテルブルクはヨーロッパとロシアのハーフです。
40,“La Capitale degli Zar”,"Una delle mete da visitare assolutamente. Il palazzo dell'Ermitage, uno dei più importanti musei al mondo, merita una visita approfondita. La parte del castello è sicuramente anch'essa interessante. Una passeggiata sul Mar Baltico è un bellissimo ricordo. Da visitare anche gli altri palazzi reali nei pressi della citta. Piacevole assistere in un teatro ad uno spettacolo di balletti."
50,“San Pietroburgo: meraviglia e (quasi) low cost!”,"Sono stato a San Pietroburgo per la prima volta nell'estate 2009 e devo dire che la città è eccezionale! Devo ammettere che l'organizzazione del mio viaggio è stata eccellente (da parte dell'agenzia turistica italiana a San Pietroburgo ""La Casa di Bury""), la città è bellissima ma loro mi hanno invitato a feste e mi hanno coinvolto totalmente, facendomi respiare il battito di questa metropoli meravigliosa...Un viaggio che, se farete con le persone giuste, non vi lascerà indifferenti! Chi ci va una volta, ci torna..."
50,“Il fascino sfarzoso sull'acqua”,"Città sfarzosa che mostra la sua bellezza nei palazzi dai diversi colori, fogge e stili; ti ubriaca nella sua energia di un recente passato e ancor più nel suo essere già in un futuro sfavillante.Ma è la città che Pietro I ha concepito e fortemente voluto sull'acqua ed è dalla Neva - e dai suoi canali dentro la città - che si sente pulsare la vita. Navigarli mollemente è come assistere ad uno spettacolo vivente: tutto ti parla, ti emoziona, ti sorprende.Le cupole a cipolla, sfaccettate e colorate, sono magnetiche: continueresti ad ammirarle con l'entusiasmo di un bambino. E la gente, numerosa, che passeggia disinvolta sulla Prospettiva Nevsky calpestando una storia densa e facendone ora una nuova.Insomma, un'emozione di città!"
50,“citta' indimenticabile e struggente”,"ho visto una citta' meravigliosa,con delle bellezze architettonicheed artistiche ( vedi museo Ermitage ) uniche al mondo.Ho deciso che il prossimo anno ci tornero' magari facendo un abbinamento con la citta' di Mosca.Consiglio a chi puo' di farci una capatina"
50,“Überraschende Erlebnisse”,"Wir haben im Vorfeld viele Warnungen und negative Beispiele gehört, waren dann aber sehr angenehm überrascht! Unser Abenteuer einer individuellen Reise für eine Woche nach St. Petersburg -Hotel und Flug privat gesucht und gebucht- hat nur schöne Erlebnisse gezeigt. Die Stadt ist sehr sauber, es gab nirgends asoziale Elemente. Wir sind mit der Tram zur Endhaltestelle gefahren, ausgestiegen und haben uns die Stadtteile abseits der Touristenzentren angesehen. Wir haben viele Großstädte auf der Welt gesehen aber so hilfsbereit wie in St. Petersburg haben wir noch keine Menschen kennen gelernt! Man brauchte nur stehen zu bleiben und nach einem Straßenschild zu sehen - schon wurde uns von allen Seiten Hilfe angeboten!Auch in den Restaurants wurden wir häufig gefragt, ob wir Hilfe benötigen: oft sind die Speisekarten nur auf kyrillisch und das konnten wir nicht lesen oder sprechen.Wir haben uns auch in fremden und entlegenden Stadtteilen nie einen Moment unsicher gefühlt.In der Stadt war überall Blumenschmuck angebracht und die weißen Nächte mit den hochgeklappten Brücken über die Newa sind unvergeßlich.Das Hotel - St. Petersburg - ist sehr gut gelegen und bot ein sehr gutes Frühstücksbüffett. Das ist aber schon alles positive, die Zimmer schmutzig, die Betten wurden nicht gemacht, manchmal gab es keine Handtücher oder aber das Personal hat in dem Zimmer geraucht!"
50,“サンクトペトロブルク”,サンクトペテルブルクの夏は夜9時頃迄本当に明るく、日が落ちてしまうのは夜11時頃。たっぷり観光を楽しめる町です。時間があれば、エルミタージュ美術館と、その美術館裏からフェリーでピョートル大帝の夏の宮殿はお勧めです。とても綺麗です。
10,“Russia o....URSS? Un viaggio da incubo in Automobile”,"Tralascio ogni considerazione sull' ignobile usanza dei visti a pagamento e delle assicurazioni infortuni che bisogna ""comprare"" al consolato pur avendo già coperture assicurative private più che capienti e valide internazionalmente...e lnvio un appello: evitate di noleggiare un'auto nei paesi Baltici sperando poi di passare in URSS!!!! In sintesi: sarete trattati come dei pericolosi criminali che tentano di inquinare la Russia immacolata! In dettaglio:1) Fra Estonia e Russia potreste passare decine di ore in un piazzale aspettando che in dogana quattro ottusi burocrati facciano il proprio comodo2) Vi contesteranno di tutto: ad esempio la non validità dell'assicurazione auto (e ve ne faranno stipulare un'altra, chiedendovi 50 euro per 1 giorno!!!!!)3) vi perquisiranno la macchina anche con cani anti droga4) Cercheranno in tutti i modi di trovare il minimo errore nello stupido formulario che dovrete compilare, evidenziandoli uno alla volta, facendovi poi rifare tutto5) appena passato il confine vi accoglierà una strada devastata, pericolosissima, da spaccare ruote e semiassi...roba mai vista nemmeno in Africa..6) Infine, dulcis in fundo, la polizia stradale: onnipresente e pronta a contestarvi di tutto: dalla non validità della nostra patente italiana, fino alle infrazioni più assurde...il loro obiettivo è spillarvi dei soldi o, se non cedete, farvi perdere più tempo possibile!E alla fine del calvario, quando arrivate a San Pietroburgo, ancora con qualche aspettativa, nonostante tutto, la delusione! Una citta caotica, solo grandiosa ma non bella, con un traffico assurdo e dei guidatori assatanati, orde di turisti e pulmann...e, sinceramente, a quel punto sarete assaliti da una domanda: ma chi me l'ha fatto fare????"
40,“夏のサンクトペテルブルク”,2008年7月にロシアに旅行しました。モスクワから夜行電車でサンクトペテルブルクに行きました。モスクワもとても美しい街でしたが、サンクトペテルブルクはそれ以上にゴージャスで、まるで絵の中にいるような気分になりました。ロシアにはユースホステルがまだまだ少ないと言われていますが、私はエルミタージュ美術館から歩いて10分ほどの、Zimmer Nice Hostelというホステルに泊まりました。ロシアに多い、いくつかのアパートでひとつのブロックになっているアパートのうちのワンフロアで、内装は新しくしてあるのですが、天井が高かったりとっても大きな出窓があったりと、サンクトペテルブルクのゴージャスなアパート気分を満喫できました。スタッフも英語ができとても親切で、今まで泊まった多くのホステルの中でも一番のお気に入りです。無料でインターネットが使え、洗濯も400円ほどでアイロンがけ＆たたんでもらうことまでできます。エルミタージュ美術館はウワサどおり本当に混んでいました！ツアーで行かずに自分でチケットを購入する場合は、1時間ほど並ぶのは覚悟されたほうがいいと思います。朝イチで行くのがおすすめです。学生だと無料なので国際学生証をお忘れなく。この美術館はそのコレクションはもちろん、もと宮殿であったその内装まで本当にゴージャスでステキです。サンクトペテルブルクとってもオススメの街です！
40,“クリスマス時期がお勧め：でもやられた。。。”,2007年12月23-26日クリスマス時期に3泊4日でサンクトに旅行しました。ヨーロッパはクリスマスに行くとレストラン・お店だけでなく、交通機関も閉じてるところが多いなか、ロシア正教では1月7日（その当時）がクリスマスにあたり、普通にお店も観光施設も開いてました。やはりエルミタージュ美術館は圧巻です。絵画もさることながら、建物・調度品が豪華絢爛で、ヨーロッパテイストとロシアが混ざった独特美でした。雪のエルミタージュはとてもきれいです。冬なのでか、どの観光施設も並ばずすんなり入れました。サンクトは治安が悪いとの触れ込みが多かったので気を張っていたのですが、人々は親切、夜歩いても、24hOpenのカフェで夜中食べても大丈夫だったので、つい油断してしまい、最後の最後にやられました。空港に向かう為サンクト一番のハイストリート；ネフスキー大通りをを駅に向かって、リュックを背負って歩いていたのですが（海外では絶対やらないのに、つい。。。）、後ろからいきなり衝撃があり、横には倒れている男性、そしてなぜかリュックの中に入れていた私の小型リュックが外に出ている。その男性は走り出しました。誰かがその男性を押してくれたのだと、肯定的に捉えています。私は小型リュックを回収し荷物を点検したところ、リュックの前ポケットに入ってた航空券と予備のドルが入ったお財布（10ドル位）がなくなってました。その当時ロシアはE-チケットがまだなく紙の発行航空券だった為、買いなおさなくてはならず、500ドル位かかりました。その小型リュックがやられてたら、パスポート、お財布貴重品が取られ大惨事になるところでした。治安がよかったのは、23日に何かのパレードがあり、そのため警察官がいっぱいいたからかもしれません。サンクトはとても綺麗な都市でこれらの事があってもいい思い出の方が強いですが、やはり治安はまだまだです。
50,“splendida San Pietroburgo!”,"San Pietroburgo è semplicemente magnifica. L'impressione è quella di trovarsi ancora nel 1700: palazzi d'epoca, strade enormi, atmosfera romantica e la Neva che penetra nella città coi suoi canali. Varrebbe la pena andarci in primavera quando funzionano le fontane che lanciano in aria migliaia di spruzzi e sulle strade sono aperti molti caffè, come da noi. Occhio se vedete dei giovani che stazionano nei sottopassi: se non state attenti vi rubano anche le scarpe. Quanto a vita notturna...spettacoli teatrali e balletti davvero eccezionali. Attenti prima della partenza: per un visto d'ingresso in Russia mi hanno chiesto 300 euro!"
50,“見所満載の美しい町です”,エルミタージュ美術館を筆頭にものすごい数の美術館・博物館があります。3日間の滞在ではぜんぜん足りませんでした～！町並みが美しく、ヨーロッパのようでありながらロシア独特の雰囲気があってすごく楽しかったです！
10,"“Die einzige Stadt, aus der wir gerne wieder abgereist sind!”","Wir reisen gern. Es gibt doch nichts Schöneres als neue Länder zu erkunden. Dabei legen wir weniger Wert auf Schlösser und Museen als auf freundliche Menschen und ein nettes Ambiente. St. Petersburg ist in dieser Beziehung ein totaler Reinfall. Niemand lächelt. In Restaurants wird man unfreundlich behandelt, oder es tauchen Extras auf der Rechnung auf, die man nicht bestellt hat. Die Sauberkeit in den Restaurants lässt oft zu wünschen übrig. Wenn man freundlich nach dem Weg fragt, wird man entweder ignoriert oder mit einer rüden Handbewegung in eine Richtung gelenkt. Das meine Kamera geklaut wurde, war ein zusätzliches Ärgernis. Die Polizei zuckt nur mit den Schultern und hat weder Name, noch Adresse oder Hergang notiert. Am Flughafen dauern die Sicherheitskontrollen ewig. Das Visum ist überteuert. Im Hotel wird man abgezockt. Im Hotel Brothers Karamazov hat man uns 1000 RUB pro Nacht mehr abgenommen, als bei der Reservierung angegeben. Wir sind uns noch nie so unwillkommen vorgekommen wie hier. St. Petersburg war bisher die einzige Stadt, aus der wir gerne wieder abgereist sind."
50,“Eine der schönsten Städte auf unserem Planeten”,Gemeinsam mit meiner Tochter habe ich während der weißen Nächte im Juni 2008 St. Petersburg besichtigt.Alles war traumhaft schön:Peter-Paul-FestungEremitagePuschkin und Katharinenpalast mit BernsteinzimmerPeterhofBallett im Mariinsky TheaterFolklore-Show im Nikolaevsky PalaceSt. Petersburg ist eine der schönsten Städte auf unserem Planeten.Wir kommen bald wieder!
40,"“Schön, aber teuer”","St. Petersburg ist ein wunderschöne, aber teure Stad, und sehr sehr groß. Turnschuhe sind Pflicht. Kleiner Schirm in der Tasche ist zu empfehlen. Das Zentrum ist sehr gepflegt. Die Leute sind nett. Man hat das Gefühl, durch eine ganz normale westliche Großstadt zu gehen. Nachts kann man sich im Zentrum bedenkenlos rumtreiben. Besoffene oder Randalierer sieht man im Zentrum von St. Petersburg nicht. Das Essen ist jedoch ein Problem. Es gibt fast nur fastfood und teure Restaurants. Deshalb besser in den kleinen Supermärkten einkaufen und auf dem Hotelzimmer essen. Die Lebenshaltungskosten sind ca. doppelt so hoch wie in Deutschland. Ein Hotelzimmer für 100 Euro hat den Standard eines Hotels in Deutschland von 50 Euro. Essen gehen im Restaurant für 40 Euro bietet die Qualität deutscher Restaurants von 20 Euro usw.. Die Pubs sind etwas ungemütlich, meist im Souterrain. Besser die zahlreichen kleinen Discos aufsuchen oder besser, an der Newa entlang schlendern. (4.07.2008)"
