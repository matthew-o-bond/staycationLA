50,"Wonderful, Warm,Welcoming Indie Bookstore!","I love when I find a wonderful magical Indie bookstore, and Once Upon A Time Bookstore did not disappoint. I visited Once Upon a Time several times during my Thanksgiving holiday visit to Montrose. Owner Maureen and staff are friendly and helpful. They have a varied collection of books for adults and children, fun gift ideas and greeting cards. I felt a real sense of community and neighborly spirit, and encountered many happy long-time customers. Nice selection of Christmas ornaments and holiday cards. Extensive children's book section. For a small store, the owners sure do get a lot of offerings packed into a well organized charming space. A real treasure as another reviewer stated!",Alice

50,One of the Best Kid's Book Stores on the West Coast,I collect children's books - so I hit any kid's book store I can find. I'm always looking for new recommendations.The owner of Once Upon A Time is truly delightful and loves children's literature. I was very impressed at the LA Festival of Books with the number of authors she helped to pull into the event.Thoughtful and fun selection - better than any chain or dot com could be! Worthy of your business!,jennifer s
