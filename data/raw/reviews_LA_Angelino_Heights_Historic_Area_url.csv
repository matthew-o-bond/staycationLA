50,Lovely Victorian Homes,"I was on my way up to Hollywood and decided to stop here for a little bit and look around the area after hearing so much about it. There are so many Victorian homes in the area in varying degrees of condition (some are beautifully maintained, others need a bit of TLC) and it has a fascinating history as one of the oldest suburbs in LA!Some individual houses have gained their own notoriety by being used in popular films and television series over the years, which makes sense given the neighborhood’s proximity to Hollywood. One house for example was used in the “Charmed” series while another one just down the street was used in Michael Jackson’s iconic music video for “Thriller.”It was a pretty short trip and I walked around for about a half hour but it is definitely worth a visit if you’re into Victorian architecture! Just try to be respectful of the residents living here since it still is an actual neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Recommended walking tour,The LA Conservancy's monthly walking tour in and about these homes was incredibly informational and connected us to the community and individuals living in these historic homes. It was the perfect length of time for a reasonable price with a wonderful guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/578anniek
50,Beautifully restored and well kept Victorian homes in LA,"The Angelino Heights Historic Area is close to downtown LA and not far from Echo Park. It is just a few blocks some beautiful and colorful houses from a very romantic era of architecture and style. The streets are a pleasure to walk through and especially on Carroll Street, you will find house after house of fashionable architecture and craftsmanship. They just don't build them like this anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Beautiful houses,"I don't think you would spend more than maybe 20 minutes in this neighborhood but the houses are absolutely beautiful! Like in old movies! I'm thinking Anne of Green Gables and such, beautiful Victorian houses! I absolutely recommend this area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FireballH
40,Historic Homes in a Beautiful Neighborhood,"When one walks through this area, it is hard to believe you are smack dab in the middle of twenty-first century Los Angeles...one feels he has been transported back 100 years to a small town. The homes in this area are old and are kept up really well...the streets are clean and the gardens are well manicured. There are only about six blocks worth walking along...one does not need to spend much time here to appreciate the area. Parking is available on the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,Wonderful driving tour of the area,Angelino Heights was the first really fashionable area of the Los Angelos before Hancock Park and Beverly Hills. This small historical area is off the map unless you know the history of the city and is now part of the up and coming Echo Park district that is the new hipster area. The homes are really a treat and are Victorian with a California twist to them. The whole neighborhood is in transition right now and spend your time driving through the winding roads above downtown and really look at the neighborhood set up. It is a treat to history buffs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
20,Eh,"I don't really have much to say about this experience except ""eh"". I had heard a lot of great things but I was very underwhelmed by the whole thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelmelanietravek
50,Great Walking Tour,"I read Charles Fleming's ""Secret Stairs"" in LA and decided to visit Angelino Heights. The 2.5 miles walk starts from Echo Park Lake and continues to Angelino Heights (about 2 hours). I also checked out the LA Conservancy website for additional information prior to the walk. Both sources provide general information about the neighborhood which helps a lot. It was a perfect time to visit as the weather wasn't too hot, and the lotuses at Echo Park Lake are blooming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kizofdragon
50,Angelino Heights walking tour,"We took the Angelino Heights walking to with the Los Angeles Conservancy. The tour is offered the first Saturday and reservations are required.Google the Los Angeles Conservancy for information about the tour.I have driven Carroll Street and Angelino Heights a number of times.This time I parked the car and walked the neighborhood. A treat was being invited into several of the homes and seeing the restoration efforts of the homeowners.Take the L.A. conservancy tour if you enjoy home restoration and the preservation of Los Angeles heritage,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,"Great little visit, you're in for a nice time","If you've seen San Francisco, these three streets will seem very little compared to the thousands of Victorian gems you can admire there. But having a little stroll down this quiet neighborhood is a treat. Please park your car and walk. It drove me nuts to see all these tourists slowing down in front of the best looking houses. The whole ""tour"" can be wrapped in 30 min max. So please get out and walk!Some of the houses are in beautiful shape others need a million dollar renovation. And that is the beauty of this visit : you walk around, you pick the house you could see yourself living into, you see one that looks very bit up and you think: what a great set for a horror movie! And then, you try to imagine the old old lady who owns it and all these nasty real estate sharks waiting for her to finally die. Anyway, in order to enjoy this, you need to be into architecture, history and be a curious mind.Push the walk further about 15 min and check out the Echo Park lake down the hill. They did a great job renovating it. It is a very pleasant place to have a picnic, read a book in the shade, chat your ears off with a friend you have not seen for a while. If you do both in one day you'll tell yourself: ""Los Angeles is a pedestrian friendly town, and this area is adorable.""Well don't get carried away here! 15 years ago this was ""a no go zone"" but it is true that you can walk and walk around Echo Park and feel safe and happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayounaise
50,Beautiful Victorian Homes,"We drove Carroll Ave to look at the Victorian homes. Some were fully restored others were in varying degrees of repair. If you like the Victorian area or interesting architecture this is worth a visit. Wish there would have been a guided tour of the outside of these beautiful homes. All are privately owned, can only imagine what the interiors would be like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ncjc2013
50,Magnificent Victorian Homes,"We drove on CarrolL Ave. and just in 1 block there were about 12 beautiful Victorian homes. There were some on restoration. It's just a place to take photos; there are probably no tours to view inside the homes as these are livable homes but if you love that era and architecture, you will love this block. I believe there is a walking tour offered but I don't know the details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maggiet0813
50,Visit with LA Conservancy,"We visited Angelino Heights, specifically Carroll Avenue on a LA Conservancy walking tour (held first Saturday of every month). It was a wonderful glimpse into LA's first real suburb, and latterly first recognised historic district.An informative and enjoyable two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arncliffegirl
50,Would love to live there,"A lovely hill with beautiful old wooden victorian houses, near a green space, Echo Park. Pretty expensive, of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RozettaKM
40,Take the turn,"Nice little detour from the madness of LA traffic, just before the street grid of downtown. Take a 5 minute drive, or a 15 minute walk, and see why, historically, rich people built homes on hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamnyc
30,Nice older houses nightmare traffic,"About 4 blocks of old victorians. Stopped and talked with an inhabitant who gave us extra knowledge-- like Michael Jackson's Thriller video was made at the house, etc. That really added to the visit. Driving or creeping along the freeways in downtown LA is a nightmare so don't go near it if you are in a hurry. For instance, 45 minutes to go 12 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndovale
50,If you love history and architecture...,Don't miss this if you do. I guess we are kind of weird in that when we travel we don't do museums and the usual touristy stuff. We like to ride or walk through neighborhoods. People watch and building gawk. Shop with the masses and feel like we belong. So what a treasure this is. A neighborhood that is perfectly preserved...some homes were moved here...with Victorian gems that anyone would find surprising to be located in LA. Houses are ornate and awe inspiring. It is an historic neighborhood. A real neighborhood. Mostly affordable. In LA. Some still needing restoration and pampering. Others mind bogglingly enriched. I do not think that all that many people know about this area yet. But so worth a ride or walk through if you love old houses and their accompanying neighborhoods. This will be a well known gem in no time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaitaliaupstateNY
50,NIce drive :),"Really nice drive through this historic part of LA. Spend a few minutes appreciating the architecture. I wasnt sure if there were specific things to stop and do, but the drive was nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelanies_13
50,Very beautiful homes....take u back in time!,"We visit with my husband and toddler and wasn't dissapointed. The houses were very beautiful and made you feel you went back in time. We wished there were more to watch since we got spoiled after seeing them but there were enough to for us take a nice memory in our minds of how the neighborhoods use to be. A nice piece of hidden treasure in Los Angeles. If you decide to visit please note that the location on ""maps"" is incorrect. The location is close to downtown Los Angeles (on Carroll street), not near the LAX airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/am2129
50,Victorian / Eastlake Homes,"Angelino Heights is considered one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles. Built on a hill just a few miles west of the city center, the area was developed in the mid-1880s by William W. Stilson and Everett E. Hall. It is one of the few neighborhoods in Los Angeles remaining intact from the Victorian era with this style of architecture, and is located just east of Echo Park and south of Dodger Stadium.It is a sidewalk walking tour of Carroll Ave, well worth the short walk or slow driving tour. Carroll Avenue is a National Register Historic District, and in 1983 was designated as the first historic district (Historic Preservation Overlay Zone) in the City of Los Angeles. These late 19th century homes are private residents and many have been restored, some in various stages of restoration. A walking tour is best to see the various exterior details of each home and to take photos. Unfortunately because they are private residences you cannot enter and see the interiors. Oh well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npphotog
