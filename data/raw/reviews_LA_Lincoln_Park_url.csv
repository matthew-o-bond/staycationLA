20,Nothing special.,This place is kind of sad because it’s clear it’s better days are behind it. The trails are poorly maintained and there are numerous abandoned cars housing the homeless. We were there at 9:15 AM and it didn’t exactly feel safe. I won’t go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FlyinHawaiian67
30,Lincoln Park has a lake,"Located in Northeast Los Angeles, Lincoln Park is a large park with a lake, ball fields, community center and lots of open space. It is a favorite gathering place for the community on the weekends. It is about 5 or 6 miles from downtown Los Angeles if you go north on Main Street. Not as nice or picturesque as Echo Park as the lake is smaller and there are no lotus pads. But ducks and geese can be found there on their migration north and south. Named in honor of President Lincoln and located in the Lincoln Heights district of LA. Unfortunately, there do not seem to be boats on the lake anymore. However, still a nice place to enjoy the view of the lake or do sports on the large fields.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
30,Large Park with Lake,"This park is situated in the center of a Los Angeles Latino neighborhood...the park is large with a beautiful lake. Some people actually try to fish in it! There is a senior center and a neighborhood community center. We were there on a weekday, and the park was rather quiet and refreshing (I believe the park gets quite crowded on weekends). It's a nice park, however, one does not need to go out of their way to experience it...Los Angeles has many other parks that are better than this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
