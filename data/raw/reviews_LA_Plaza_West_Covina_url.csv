50,visit at Nordstrom Rack & Macys,"I go to the Nordstrom Rack from time to time to check their clothes. I have bought tops & bras there that I like. Macy's is on the other end of the Mall, but I like their Woman's dept & their MC handbags",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trail622546
50,Good market and very good smoothies!,Good market with fresh fruits and veggies and very good smoothies! The place has a restaurant for a quick bite.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magggie_bo
50,Plaza West Covina 2000's,"This is one of my Ex's favorite malls the shops are upscale,and clean.I want to apologize to the 2 white girls I left in the garage I picked up at the West Covina mall it was an Emergency.I owe you 2 free lunch,and dinner or we can make a deal.-Anthony",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonyburns215
30,Simple no frills mall,"Title pretty much sums the Plaza up. Definitely not a great mall, very simple and even had some weird tenants like a school and a real estate agents office lol. Still had some big anchors though and the essentials if you need them but average at best",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nijac2018
30,Good local but not regional Westfield,"This mall has been upgraded in the past 10 years or so, but it's not of the level of a Santa Anita or Brea, which are larger and more regional in draw. Also, if you're a Baby Boomer, other than the Macy's, this is a mall that caters more to younger tastes in clothes. It does have some good restaurants though, like Lazy Dog and Lucille's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HardBop
40,Going down hill!,"If you are a teen, or looking for shoes or jewelry this is the place. Been going here since 1986 and I can see the decline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X6035ANtonym
40,Convenient and accesible,"Plenty of stores to shop. Macy's, J CPenneys, Sears, Best Buy, Nordstrom Rack, Sees Candies to name a few. Plenty of parking in and around the plaza. It is two stores only. So need for long walks to walk from one store to another. Close to freeway 10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelbugLosangeles
50,Excellent Selection of Stores and Restaurants,I grew up going to this mall and I always enjoy shopping here. They renovated it a few years ago and added more restaurants which made the mall more enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/680juliusc
50,Great Quick Meal,"The lunch counter @ Amapola serves great, gresh Mexican Food. Also the grocery produce section is very well kept.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestCovinaMama
40,Good selection of stores and restaurants,"As a local, I go to this mall for several reasons. It has several good restaurants on the side facing the freeway. I have a young son, so we go to the kids play area while mama gets to shop. There are several snack shops to get pretzels and boba drinks, and there are several locations throughout the mall. They also have several anchor stores that I would shop.The only downside is that the mall is so big, there are pockets of empty stores. Also, I recommend parking on the second floor of the parking structure, where I can always find a space. The open parking on the freeway side with the restaurants is always crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
40,Nice selection of stores,"Seemed like a nice clean mall. Not too overpriced with their stores, and not too cheap either. Nice comfortable mall. The top floor was a little warm that day so it was kind of uncomfortable. The food court was rather small too. However there were several nice looking restaurants to choose from. Would definitely come here again!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stars4dt
50,The best.,"A place to buy many things for all occasions! From vclothes, household goods sporting equipment, you'll find it here. Right off the 10 freeway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneer304
50,good prices,good selection of choices and diversity and since were all different when it comes to clothing it really helps having different options,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/658valuedc
40,Lower Prices,"This is one grocery store in West Covina Mall. After, I am done with my work out upstairs, I would normally stop by Amapola to order some snacks like quesadilla (my favorite) and also buy the fruits that I needed at home. Considering that the location is inside the mall, which means HIGH RENT, there prices are still lower compared to Vons, etc. The cashiers are also professional. Thank you for being in a place that is very convenient for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/729felicidadm
40,Everything You Need,"This is a large mall with many popular anchor stores and all the rest. I found what I need at the Best Buys with good prices and good service. Hint: If you want Starbucks coffee, the store is NOT in the mall but actually fronts on Vincent and is a drivethru. But, you can park near mall and sit inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyTraveler0109
50,very clean and nice shopping mall,1st time visiting this shopping mall and I was surprised how clean this place was. I liked the food court a lot.It's not common to have a Nordstrom Rack inside of a shopping mall. Another of my favorite is the Tokyo Japanese Lifestyle store.Too bad I didn't have time to visit the other stores.Maybe next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheoH780
50,Probably the best part of the West Covina Westfield Shopping mall.,"I love the drinks there, and the fact that if I want a healthy snack I can grab a fruit in the produce section. Yay!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556shaunar
20,Mall with no identity,I've been going to this mall when Tower Records was still there. I actually miss those days. Now it is a mall that lacks identity. Some areas are remodeled (exterior). And other spots such as the Sears and Macys haven't been touched in at least a couple of decades. Nothing matches. Parking is now tricky and to get in and out of this mall can be problematic at times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseR_11
50,This is my Mall,There are many shops and stores and cool eating places at the Plaza West Covina. They even have a market here. I don't remember seeing one at another mall. The people who work here are super friendly and eager to help you. My favorite store is Best Buy.. My favorite eating place is.....all of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daddy1020
40,"Nice Clean Mall, plenty of parking","It is a mall that my wife loves to go to. I seldom go except for the restaurants. I shop there about twice a year in and out in 20 minutes. The usual stores Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, Best Buy and all the other little shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredIBEW
20,No parking,"This mall has gotten nicer in the last few years, however the crammed too many restaurants in one space with very little parking. I went on a Tuesday during school and it took me 30 min to find a parking spot clear at the other end of the mall.This mall is not high end at all, I call it ghetto vina mall, but if you are in need of a jc Penny or Macy's this mall has it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/406tiffanyb
40,A much better mall than the original!,"I have lived in the area for 43 years and have seen many changes. One of them is the complete renovation of the West Covina Mall. Ever since Tower records and Clifton's Cafeteria disappeared, the Mall had needed to be updated for many years. When Westfield took on the project, I knew it would be big. The end result is a fully modernized stylish shopping experience. It houses all the expected outlets and chain stores. With the now attached shopper access way to Best Buy, all areas of the mall can be accessed from inside with the exception of the exterior restaurants. A decent variety of eateries are offered and most are good. The mall also features a Gold's Gym. Parking can be challenging most of the time, but be patient. I'm actually surprised that the mall is packed almost all the time. But that is a good thing for the economy and jobs. There is definitely a security presence and constant patrols by security vehicles in the parking lot. Overall, it is a good mall that offers most anything that shoppers might want. Check it out. It is worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelrH6268OA
