10,Don't waste your time!!!!,"I've had some problems with them not letting me use credits from my account. I've gone in person, called, sent letters, certified letter and still no reply. I've posted things on another site and they politely posted a note asking me to reach out to them through email or their site - DOESN'T WORK and it's not even Massage Envy.They are unprofessional and lack the ability for customer support.I've even tried to call the corporate office and no reply.Looks like my reasonable requests to resolve issues with them is not something they are interested in. I would stay clear from this location as well as Massage Envy in general.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustJennys
30,Basic,"Considering that we had a discounted rate because we were first-time customers it went all right. However the upsell on the subscriptions and the cost there after seems too high. I've become a fan of the small Asian massage parlors located throughout La Harbra, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights and other surrounding areas that provide great service at a much lower cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/messofelegance
50,This is not a day spa - but they are professionals for the 1 hour massage,"Massage Envy is not a full day spa - it is all about the 1 to 1.5 hour massage or facial experience. I am a member at Massage Envy - however, you do not have to be a member to go. There is an introductory rate if you go to Massage Envy for the first time, but the value of becoming a member is huge compared to singular massage purchases.The La Habra location knows its therapists well. Therefore, I always feel like I can tell them what I like and they will find me the best therapist fit available for the time I need. Massage Envy also allows the massage to be customized - so don't be shy if you don't like a certain area massaged. I always like neck and upper back focus with face massage at the end - be specific to get your favorite experience. Every therapist has been accommodating.Massage Envy has always been on time for me - which is great if you have limited time or a schedule to follow.Lately it has been almost impossible to get an appointment on the day of - so try to schedule a few days in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALinCA5512
