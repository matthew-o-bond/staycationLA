The large red ribbon empathising with those who have HIV/AIDS is cogent.Neo-Gothic in style its decorative facades are wonderful. Work began in 1927 and it was completed in 1930.Its ornateness and Hollywood location has attracted movie makers and it has often featured as a filming location.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Beautiful church blocks away from the sleaze of Hollywood,Quite a lovely church both snide and out. It's about a block away from the tawdry parts of Hollywood. Built in the 1920's it has a very diverse congregation. Was used in the Mrs. Robinson movie with Dustin Hoffman ( the famous church scene at the end).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
