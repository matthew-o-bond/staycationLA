50,Panoply of stars,"Portraying an array of stars in full colour, it is eye-catching along the famous Boulevard. Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe are just two featuring.Painted by Tom Suriya in 1983, it reverses the normal order of a movie theatre. Here the stars are the audience looking at us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

40,Worth looking at if nearby,This is actually a famous mural of older hollywood stars located off of hollywood blvd. It really is a neat thing to see if nearby but I wouldn't go out of my way if you aren't already in the area. Nice to see and take pictures of if you see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
30,Wouldn’t have travelled specifically to see it,"We saw this en route back to our car after waking down Hollywood Boulevard and saw it by accident. Decent mural of some of the older Hollywood legends, and we had fun trying to spot the who’s who ... worth a look if you happen across it but don’t make a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zavarony
30,Naming the stars of yesteryears,"We happened to be in the area and decided to check this out. Luckily, it was just around the corner of the hotel we had lunch. It is a huge rectangular mural at the corner of Wilcox and Hollywood blvd. Coming from the east onollywood Blvd. turn left to Wilcox and it will be on the left. If you want a photo of the whole thing be there early morning. It gets pretty busy by noon with vehicle and pedestrian traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
40,"Be a Star, Amongst Legends.","This mural showed up in 2017 acclaimed hit ‘La La Land’ and was among the filming locations that I wanted to see when visiting Los Angeles.It’s a nice throwback to the Icons and Legends of the classic era of Hollywood, and while, not a must see - it’s along the boulevard and so, you don’t have to go out your way to see it and (for a photograph), be the star of the show, amongst some of the greats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pale_Blue_Dot_85
