40,Nice views and experience at the Malibu beach,"Pier and restaurant was closed, but was able to walk out onto the beach and dip my feet into the Pacific Ocean on a beautiful day. People were definitely out on the beaches. Very nice area. Picturesque.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DM_1278
40,Picturesque and Pricey stop along the 101!,Very picturesque and much more low key then the various Piers to the South. Breakfast was just “ok” at Malibu Farm but may have just been our selections. We enjoyed our brief stop here during our Pacific Coast Adventure. It does get pricey quickly though! Would probably skip on next 101 trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azroyalsfan
40,"Uncrowded, but pricey","We drove with my adult son and his young family to the Malibu pier to enjoy the President's Day holiday. While the pier and its restaurants and shop were good and interesting, the prices of everything from parking ($15) to a wooden, toy 6-inch pickup truck ($74) to the breakfast food (over $100 for 3 adults) were lofty. But, the ocean view and the half-hidden mansions on the hill beach-side were, indeed, spectacular. This pier is much more laid-back than either the Venice Beach or Santa Monica Piers and is worth a trip on a nice day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wyomite
50,Experiencing the ocean,"After beginning our day in Malibu at the marvellous Pepperdine University campus we took a bus back to the pier.We enjoyed a relaxing pleasant amble to the end, revelling in the oceans views and gentle bustle. It’s a popular spot for fishing and hiring of boats.Ample cafes and eateries are onboard and we enjoyed a coffee and cappuccino in one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,"Beautiful setting and view, and food is good too","Beautiful setting and view. We ate at the cafe part at the end of the pier. The food was very good, much better than you'd expect considering that it's such an obvious place for tourists etc. Our only complaint is that there were quite a few flies buzzing around when we were there. Otherwise 5 stars. And of course expect it to be very crowded at peak seasons and times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xman_7
40,Views from Malibu pier,Nice pier with shops and food. Great view out both ways showing the coastline and hills. Clean and not crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U5760CXdamiend
40,Perfect stroll,"We started at the Malibu pier and strolled south down the beach for about a mile and a half to an obvious Rockpoint and then came back. Beach is perfect for a stroll, and the houses are quite varied and worth looking out from the ocean side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rbschoene
40,Charming spot,"Lovely stroll and views, a great cafe at the base of the pier, it wasn't busy on the day we were there, very relaxing. We walked there along the beach from the place we stayed in Malibu, but if you drive keep in mind that the parking next to the pier is $15. You can park for free in the Malibu Country Mart if you don't mind about 15 mins walk from there to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIUU
50,Day at the beach.,"Spent the day at Malibu Lagoon State Beach-Surf Rider, and the Pier. It was awesome shopping on the Pier, and watching the Surfers from Surf Rider beach. Amazing views in all directions. Great day for families, friends and couples. The pic with this post is a vendor selling jewelry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busysvacationtime
20,Did we miss the stop??,"Being from Europe, you see and hear about Malibu Beach on many TV shows/films. It was definitely a place a wanted to stop off at on our way from LA to Santa Barbara. BUT, did I miss the only parking place there was?Driving up the PCH we thought there would be numerous stops to park up and wander on down to the beach. The beachfront from LA through Malibu appears to be house after house with no openings down to the beach. We approached Malibu Pier on our left and decided to ride past it thinking there would be other parking opportunities a little further down the road (like there is at Santa Monica). If there were, we couldn't find any. It seems the rich and famous not only have access to their beautiful homes but the stretch of beachfront in front of them. The one place we managed to find access on to the beach was just past Starbucks on a narrow street but there was no parking and the beachfront area in front of the houses seemed cordoned off.We didn't have time to double back on ourselves to try the Pier again so we kept going. Tried parking at Point Dume but with only about 8 car parking spaces and clamping in effect for illegally parking in the streets nearby, we had to bypass this one too. Finally we reached Zuma Beach. Lovely stretch of sand with some big waves.I get if you have the money to buy one of these million dollar homes, you don't want nosey tourists peering in at you from the beach but I was disappointed that it wasn't quite as I'd expected.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grays_on_Holiday
40,"Nice stroll, views","Walked the Pier while in town. Nice Stroll, enjoyed watching nearby surfers. Did not dine at restaurant but looked tasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364julief
40,Pier near Nobu Hotel & Restaurant.,"I always drove by this place and never stopped by, so I parked my car along PCH a mile south, then walked back towards the pier on the beach.The coast line on this part of Malibu was beautiful, with the view of ocean and million dollars houses. If you walk north toward pier, there are rock formations in front of Malibu pier, you can’t cross over the rocks, and climb up to the pier bridge. So, you may go up the stairs toward Nobu hotel parking, and walk on the sidewalk of PCH to get to the Malibu Pier sign. Parking in this area is 15-20＄range, in busy summer time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toshi110110
30,Had to be done ...,I know this has to be done but really not that impressive unless you want a different angle on the hundreds of surfers in the water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdD836
40,Cool Vibe,I love the laid back vibe of the Malibu pier. Malibu Farm offers great food and that Cali cool atmosphere and the gift shop at the end of the pier has a great selection of unique things for everyone on your list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Judy_Boom
40,No big deal bu emblematic,"There is really not much exiting going on here, but if you are in the area, it is worth visiting. because of its place in popular culture. Many films have been shot at the per and it is an impressive structure. People actually catch fish there, there is a restaurant and a couple of souvenir shops. They also have public restrooms. The view towards the ocean and the California coast is awesome so cameras are a must. Parking will be a problem in busy days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AJS-NY
30,Great views.,Definitely worth a stop. $10 to park for that short stop however. Nice shot of the Malibu coast and the surfers in the distance. The two food places looked quaint but pricey as expected. Lots of people fishing from the pier.We moved further down the PCH to watch the sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCMommy
40,Great spot for a short visit,I have to start by saying we are a couple in our 60’s.We enjoyed our visit. It was a nice way to spend an hour or so on a lovely afternoon.But I’m sure the younger visitors who were interested in the rides would have given 5 stars.The view up the beach in either direction was great.We stopped to watch a magician which was a bit of fun and we also ate hotdogs and enjoyed them.A good stop on our visit to the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenSydneyAustralia
30,Beautiful views,Beautiful views of the ocean however nothing to do other than eat or shop in 1 small tourist shop. The restaurants are pricey but well worth it as the food and service were excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susieio
30,Low key pier,"There were many local fishermen, although the entire time we were there we didn’t see one fish caught. There are 2 restaurants on the pier, same menus. Both serve very good food. Parking is a challenge as you can do street parking or paid parking. In the afternoon it was $15 and later that night it was $10. One small gift shop is permanent and there was also 2 temporary vendors selling items.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Live-n-theMoment7
30,"Beautiful scenery, but not much to the pier.","We are from the east coast, near Philly, Pa. We spent a week in Southern California, then drove up the Pacific Coast Highway taking in the beautiful sights and stopping at several towns/places along the way. Malibu is beautiful to see, however the pier is really nothing special and if someone asked me, I'd say; ""Skip it."" Yes there are homes belonging to the rich and famous, actors, whoever, but it is very private and secluded and really - just a beach with great views/natural beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ddenton159
50,Marvelous Malibu Pier,"If you are visiting Malibu this is a must. If you just want to walk out onto the pier you will see surfers, sea life and amazing views of the Pacific ocean and panoramic views of Malibu. If you want to go to the pier and eat, Malibu Farms restaurant is wonderful and great ocean view dining. There is parking at the end of the pier which you have to pay for, but very convenient. This is also a great place to see celebrity sightings if that is your thing. Overall, well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BDarst

50,Legendary pier,Walk down the pier and look out over the north side. railing. Take in the view of nice breakers on scores of wet suit clad surfers jockeying for position or enjoying a ride. Look close and you might find a present day Gidget or Moondoogie riding the surf or on the beach with toes in the sand. This is a legendary pier and beach area. Take a walk on the beach and around the point and lagoon. Parking is on PCH or in adjacent fair priced lots. Rent a kayak or a surf or paddle board and give it a go. Beach Boys music 🎶 will be on your mind. Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billiebear1

20,$150 simple sweat shirts. It's Malibu,"Very little going on on this pier late March evening. Understand where you are: $150 sweat shirts, $45 T shirts and $15 small chocolate bar. Maybe 3 chocolates instead of a T is a good deal, at least in Malibu!Bars on pier near shore end were populated, but not very busy. One time visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MplsStPaul

40,Nice walk after breakfast,"lovely walk after lunch at the farm, middle of December and sun was out and nearly 20 degrees. the views of the end looking right down the coast made the trip all the better.

30,It's a Pier,"The restaurants on the pier were crowded and hectic. No one coordinated a welcome, as there are two check-in booths across from one another. We chose indiscriminately and found our own seats. No one really noticed our arrival, so we left and went back to our favorite spot, Carbon Beach Cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patient111

30,Peaceful and relaxed,"We went to the Malibu Pier in the morning of a sunny day. The morning fog made it had to take good pictures of the coastline but it was nice for some close up shots.It was a laid back experience walking along the pier, as there weren’t many people there - mostly fisherman and locals.I do prefer Santa Monica Pier as there is more to do and it’s a bit more exciting but if you prefer the quiet life then this is for you.It’s free to walk along the pier and there are two cafes - one at the entrance and one at the end of the pier. There are also some small shops which sell merchandise along the pier as well which were nice to stop at and have a look.The parking around the pier is free - you can choose between the car park or street parking.It’s quite close to the small Malibu township which has some cute boutiques and restaurants.It was nice to visit, probably wouldn’t go back to the pier again unless there was a reason to do so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzkatieb

30,Prefer Santa Monica,"This Pier is okay but nothing compared to the Santa Monica Pier. Good views of the sunset but that's about it. And if you like fishing, this is also a good spot for that. The restaurants are highly popular and had long queues when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeLundgren
50,Malibu Pier,We had our reunion at Pacific Cove Beach Club so we took a stroll to the pier. The weather was perfect and the water was warmer than usual. Malibu is a beautiful area however traffic was very heavy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathyaK7081KU
50,Love it!,"Went there on a Saturday morning, the sun out - the dolphins playing ... and expected a brilliant view and prepared to have some mediocre food at tourist trap prices. Sure this place is not cheap - and spending $57 (including tax and tip) for two breakfasts, a coffee and a cappuccino is not exactly a bargain.Nevertheless, we liked the food, were well fed and, most importantly, had an amazing morning sitting on the deck and watching the dolphins play.Let me make myself very clear: this is not ""the best breakfast I ever had"" and I do find $6 for a cappuccino and $4 for a serve-yourself coffee (plus tax and tip, of course) questionable. Well then, this place is simply amazing - far from being as crowded as the Santa Monica Pier. And amazingness does almost always come with a price tag. If you've never been and want to hang out and chill - this is the place to go. And if you are on a tight budget, get fed at Jack in the box across the street and have a coffee or a soda here. It's definitely worth going, hence the five stars (I would have possibly given four, but I wanted to make up for people rating this place with one star only with the comment ""...Parking is not enough at street. Have to pay to park.... "").",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuidoKarp
50,Nice place,Highly recommend going there. Get there early. Because parking is rough. A lot of European tourist. Free to get on and the. Each is great also,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oddman007

Little shop at end of the pier, see the surfers out to the right or fishermen at the end.Not the action of Santa Monica but a great low key beach afternoon for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superstar08
30,Doesn't live up to the hype,"It's a pier, you can walk along it and see the sea - but the hype around Malibu as a premier destination with palms and sunsets is overdone. Yes it's near LA / Hollywood but we found more picturesque beaches further down the coast towards San Diego. But, there is cool beachside campsite (mainly for RVs) at Thornhill Broome / Point Mugu just west of Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAF_Wales

It isn't very long and there is not a lot on it, but there is a cute looking (expensive - duh this is Malibu) organic restaurant. We stopped in the shop and had THE BEST ice cream sandwiches ever. They were expensive but homemade and good. The big question is, it it worth the effort and money to park the car? I say no. However, if you have someone like we did who dropped us off so we could do a quick 20 minutes on the pier and get the ice cream, I say go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRKPinCH41

30,Overrated,"We went out of our way to visit this pier, and I wouldn't do it again. There are really just 2 restaurants (good, but not any better than many other restaurants that are more convenient), one gift shop (interesting but expensive), and people fishing off the pier. Difficult and expensive to park. It is pretty, but, other than that, I fail to see the appeal. Plenty of other places for nice views in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLS006

40,Cute,"There a restaurant (Malibu Farms), cafe (smaller menu but delicious), gift shop, ice cream vendor, and like 1-2 other vendors. The pier offers great views and you can see some world famous surfing. But small so it’s not an all day experience. The beach is right next to the pier. It was clean and well taken care of.

40,Quaint litte pier,Malibu pier was my favorite of all the beach pier/boardwalks in the area. It was less crowded than the others in the area. The gift shop was overpriced but fun to look around in. We ate at both the malibu farm cafe and the malibu farm restaurant. Both were amazing! Parking is iffy. We got street spots twice but then paid $10 to park in a lot another time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheljowo
40,Lunch on the Pier,This is a very short and therefore intimate pier. It is gear towards food and is not at all commercialised. Our lunch was good if not a tad expensive but then this is Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nrf565

40,Malibu Pier is a nice walk into the Sunshine !!,"We left Santa Monica and headed to Malibu to eventually get on the Pacific Coast Highway and stopped by the pier. Its a lazy walk and easy on the feet, not as nice as Santa Monica, but fishing is available and there are restaurants to have brunch. We didn't eat but we enjoyed our stay for the short time we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyWasserman
40,The Pacific Ocean is a Wonder to Visit,"Take a walk, yes a simple walk. Few things are as soothing peaceful and energizing all at the same time as a walk along the coast. So when you are driving on the Pacific Coast Highway pump those brakes and pull over! Walk with your toes touching the Malibu sand. Smell the ocean, feel the breeze! What do you have to lose?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bookpublisher
40,Relaxing.....if you are not in a hurry.,"The only bad thing about this area is that it's hard to find a parking spot on the weekends. But if you are not in a hurry it's a nice place to stroll. Be careful though with the birds. A bird once flew into my son's head!! And also, it's very windy, so watch out for your hat!! If you are from out of town, this is one place you will want to see. There is nothing like it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Secondavenue
50,"Quite, relaxed and beautiful",We visited Malibu pier early morning and enjoyed brunch in the resturant. The pier is nice. Its old and full of character. There are places to eat and drink and great photo opps. Would recommended it to anyone driving that way along the Pacfic Highway.We parked on the road for free. Some parking is availalbe at cost around the pier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bains19
20,Offers nice views of the coast,"An enjoyable walk out to the end of the pier with a tourist gift shop and a restaurant with beer, light meals and sandwiches. But the best reason to visit is for the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bog999999999
50,A must see for tourists and us locals.,"Great pier, incredible view of Surfrider Beach, nice little shop and restaurant at the end of the pier...we grew up in California and still love going to Malibu pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackr583
30,Scenic but less activity than expected,"This pier was built in 1905 and was recommended to us for buying souvenirs and postcards. We parked at a nearby public lot for $10. The pier itself is lovely for a stroll with restaurants on either end, outdoor seating and beautiful views of Malibu Beach below. The souvenir shopping however was more of a flop. There were literally no regular picture postcards to be found. The two stores (one on each end) had wooden ones, which I know would never make it to Europe in one piece. The other souvenirs were not that great either. Overall I much prefer the fun Santa Monica Pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexy
50,relaxing stroll,just enough to look at or eat while strolling but not overdone and gaudy. It's essential malibu. I'll stroll here each time I go back to Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bashsara65

50,Delicious Dinner/Excellent Service,Beautiful restaurant that is on the ocean. Highly recommend going and try making a reservation before you arrive. The freshest farm-to-table location around LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akplmr
40,It’s Good!,There are two eateries on the Pier. One at each end. Each one serves great tasty food all day and evening. If you think Piers only have junk food.........this Pier certainly doesn’t. Parking isn’t simple. $10.00 unless you can park on the PCH. It’s certainly worth eating here - especially if you are hungry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheFlyingFrock
50,Nice Sunday spot,"I love spending an afternoon here strolling the pier after having brunch at Malibu Farm, there's a lot of young people, families, surfers, couples... it's safe and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxyTheFoxy

50,Perhaps the best stop in Malibu,"Perhaps the best stop in Malibu. Quintessential at least. In one spot you get the Gidget surfer culture, ocean views, and perhaps a seal. Crazy parking and chaos on the Pacific Coast Highway, or PCH in local lingo. For food I would wait until Neptune’s Net if I was driving north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,nice place though not much for activity,this place is nice to live for sure:) but for visiting nice to eat something and go back to other beaches for activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yhycyhn
40,Great breakfast with a VIEW!,Ate breakfast at the Pier restaurant and sat outside on top overlooking the ocean. We could watch the surfers while eating our breakfast. We had the breakfast burritos!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLWGirl
30,Malibu Pier,Restaurant has good view but not the cuisine. The waiters are nice. But the prices are a bit high for the snacks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dovbyshko
50,Great views and beach below,"Beautiful beach and pier - if you can't find free parking on the road, there are lots directly across the street from the pier for $10-15 dollars for the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aavenner
40,Gorgeous Views; Horrible Traffic,"If you're on a private tour, make the stop. If you're driving and don't live in Malibu, don't bother. The traffic is absolutely atrocious in Malibu, but I do understand why...it's beautiful. Walked out on the pier and could've stayed there all day and just watched the waves, the surfers, paddleboarders, and the world go by. It's very peaceful and tranquil just watching the water. There is an organic restaurant on the pier and if you have the time, do it as the views cannot be beat. The thing I like about the pier is that there isn't a lot to do here (like the craziness of Santa Monica), but is just a slower pace where you can relax and take in the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbrenz
40,Beautiful!,"If you're looking for a lot of stuff to do, then maybe this isn't the place for you. We loved that it wasn't too busy, rather a beautiful setting with a good restaurant, café, and shop. The shops are ridiculously expensive, but no more so than Hollywood, Santa Monica Pier, etc., IMO. The restaurant is gorgeous with great options, but questionable service (not a huge deal to us, although it really stood out since our experience at most other places in the area included top notch service). We enjoyed walking here from our hotel, the Malibu Beach Inn (which was incredible) daily. The cappuccinos at the Malibu Farm Market café were not good - stay away ;) My husband loved his freshly squeezed lemonade, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaF694
30,A pier,Has a shop and you see some surfers....whatever......has a shop and a cafe and you see some surfers.....whatever......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ihatemuppets
50,In the heart of Malibu,"The traffic is absolutely hectic in the area and if you do not live here is not worth traveling here simply to see the pier.The area though is stunning with Getty villa dominating the area near the pier, lots of stunning houses up the cliff or mountain... or near the ocean, thus subject to the permanent erosion the ocean produces.If I had the money, I would not mind having a large house in this area too: what could you complain about? Just sun, sea and great weather almost all year round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TERRAvelista
30,Not worth the trip to Malibu,"We were not particularly impressed with Malibu as a whole and the pier which was one of the highest ranked attraction behind the Getty museum was not inspiring. I would only bother to visit Malibu if you are keen on the beaches and these are not the best on the Los Angeles coast line. If you do visit, there appeared to be quite a bit of free roadside parking when we visited so you could save yourself the $10 parking in the pier car park, we were however there out of peak season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
50,Take a Stroll Down the Pier,"The pier offers great views of Malibu, plus has a bunch of cute shops and a cafe. Take an hour and hang out on the pier, surrounded by the beautiful view and sea breeze.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneExpLauren

30,Not As Expected,"Considering the area is so well known around the world, the pier was a little bit of a wash really. There's nothing on there apart from a couple of shops. Was still nice to see it but wouldn't rush back.Parking was $106/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoorLittleGarf
50,always fun,If your in the area this is a relaxing place to visit the food at the end of the pier is the best sea food the rest is just carnavial food,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IMHUEY
30,Just a pier,Not that much to do here especially compared to Santa Monica Pier. However the location is great and if you can find parking you might enjoy a meal at the restaurant. Lots of locals were going fishing. Birds in the area were also nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
30,Expensive but it’s the end of Route 66,"Coffee $6 parking on the pier at $3 per hour.Don’t make the mistake we did and park next to the pier if you only want a quick visit. It is $13 but if you’re there for the day it’s good value and you can walk to the shops and restaurants, if you don’t want to pay the pier prices.Large amount of clean serviced toilets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xyz2travel
10,What's With All The Good Reviews,"First there is no parking; zero, notta, none. Madhouse! There is nothing on this pier except a restaurant and gift shop at the end of the pier and a cafe style by the road. That's it nothing else; zero, notta, nothing! The place is ugly and rundown and this includes the entire Highway 1 through Malibu. Seriously... litter, weeds, homeless people. Wake up California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E7066VSlisas
40,Nice Walk with View,"Nice place for a walk above the water with a long view. Several well placed benches along the way. Nice little snack shack at the end, with an upper level that has even better views. Say a few fishermen on the day we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crayonline
40,Great location - Renovations were underway,Terrific place to visit when in Malibu. Great tourist shops a couple of bars and some great looking restaurants. Particularly good photo spot looking back to Santa Monica,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/306ashleyj
50,"""Simply beautiful""",We arrived in the evening to watch the sunset. The pier was great to walk out on to see the sunset into the horizon. There is a souvenir shop at the beginning of the pier as well as a small farmers market. You can also access Malibu beach from stairs by the pier. The entire area is beautiful. Don't miss a chance to view a sunset here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scoop35311
50,Must see,Have a drink and snacks at malibu farm restaurant or brekky at malibu farm cafe both on the pier. Grwat place to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V947ZOtanyas
50,Sitting on the Ocean...,We came here on our way back from Santa Monica for a little lunch break. The location is amazing as it feels sitting on the water. We had some Pizza and Salad dishes. Everything tasted so good and totally fresh. It is a great spot and I would love to come back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMT-CH
50,Iconic Site To Visit!,"When vising Malibu, nobody should pass up stopping at and walking the Malibu Pier! Through the years, the storms and fires have tried to beat up this site. Thankfully, they keep repairing the buildings back to their original look. Currently, there are a couple of good eateries to sit and enjoy the surroundings. Also, Surfrider beach is adjacent, to be able to walk the beach and watch the surfers battle for waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1

40,Good stop,Stop here to watch the fishermen & to have breakfast or lunch at Malibu Farm. Beautiful views & fresh air. Can be difficult to park in some of these areas at busy times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McAnnie1
10,Unfriendly,I planned to stop here for a couple of days to surf the local break but after one day I had enough. I grew up in Northern Ireland and had less hostility there. Parking was impossible but for the fact I arrived at 4am. The area is run down unless you live in one of the overpriced homes. The only friendly people I met where a group of homeless guys. I ended up spending the afternoon talking to them and when we parted company they asked for nothing. It's a terrible world we live in when the only truly happy people in Malibu aren't the mega rich and famous but are the guys that have nothing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffe498

40,"A nice sunset, quieter than Santa Monica","We drove particularly to visit Malibu. We stopped by a nice seafood place just minutes before reaching the pier, and it was fantastic, so we didn't have the chance to visit the restaurant within the pier itself. Otherwise, beautiful and worth visiting, way quieter than Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/769fawzib

We ate at the café at the end of the pier.Glad we stopped.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MTA-747-757-767
50,Excellent farm fresh food!,This beautiful restaurant has perfect ocean views coupled with the most excellent food!

Also - fun place to purchase some Malibu swag.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinemY9901TS

50,Nice view and Meal,"My husband and I enjoyed our time on the pier. We were able to get some great photos and views of the water. We ate at the restaurant located towards the end of the pier. The restaurant served organic food and drinks. I ordered the quesadilla and honestly it was by far the best that I had ever had. As for the drink, I should have stuck with water because the specialty drinks they have taste totally different from what you will imagine that it tastes like. Nevertheless, there is no cost to walk on the pier however, you have to pay to park. We had to pay $10 to park. It is time based. You will pay for parking right before you exit the parkingLot to the parking lot attendant. Overall, it's something to do once just to mark it off the list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cenalestravel
40,Interesting place,"I would say this pier and beach are a must see. A bit dated but there's some shopping, live music and food. The view from the end of the pier is beautiful! Parking isn't as bad as you would think and you are near the major shopping area in Malibu as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toomanypets5
20,No Parking on a weekday?,"We finally paid for parking after now being able to park on a mid-weekday. I couldn’t believe there wasn’t any parking at all! So we went a ways away, paid for parking and then walked the pier. Then, that was it? There’s nothing there. This pier is ridiculous and is popular only for the namesake. It is crowded with people there but there really isn’t anything at all to speak of there. What a disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

50,Nice walk on the pier to just look or eat a meal.,We always enjoy walking on a pier wherever we may be traveling. The Malibu Pier great and if the surf is up you can watch the surfers. The fishing is always interesting to watch even if you do not fish. The Farm is great to eat at. Parking on the highway is free but parking on the Pier Parking lot will cost you. Many times we will park and walk on the pier and then walk up the coast and view the many splendid beach front homes in the Malibu Colony.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beach_Traveler90265
50,Great views,"The pier is a great place to sit along and watch the surfers and waves crashing onto the shore. Beautiful views of some of the houses up on the hills.

30,"Nice, simple, but nothing prolific. Worth a quick stop though.","There isn't much to see on the pier itself. Construction is happening right now as well. The restaurant at the end of the pier is closed but there's one as you walk onto the pier. Its a shorter pier than, say Huntington Beach. But also less crowded. From here you can view Surfrider beach, where some good breaks happen, as well as the Adamson House, Malibu's FIRST beach house. (One should visit that venue and grounds as well-more to see than the pier.) But for a lazy evening walk or quick respite after dinner from V's across the street, its a nice simple and small pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632

40,Classic Southern California beach icon,We took family from out of town to Malibu for lunch and a view of the coastline. The Malibu pier is still under construction at the end but very popular otherwise. At the front is a bustling restaurant and bar and further on are nice benches to sit on and watch the beachgoers and surfers. Beyond those are the local fisherman using the pier fishing poll holders. The whole pier was in great condition and must have been renovated recently.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martinkQ7630MZ
40,Road Trip,Took friends visiting from France on a road trip today. Decided to visit the Malibu pier and while there stopped for lunch at the Malibu Farm Restaurant.Parking is $10 in the two lots near the pier. We were lucky to find a spot to park on PCH a couple of blocks south of Nobu's a fine Japanese Restaurant. A ten minute walk got us to the pier where we found the Malibu Farm Cafe at the end of the pier was closed due to being remodeled. It should open in time for the summer tourist season. So we went to the Malibu Farm Restaurant which is at the beginning of the pier.We were pleased to get seated right away even though it was 12:15. We experienced good service and great food. Our friends from France even stated they were pleased with how good the food is the USA.I had the hamburger cooked to perfection. The others in the group enjoyed the chicken sandwich.The stop was a nice break on what ended up being a 150 mile road trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halpie52

30,Grab a couple drinks and maybe dinner on the pier,"We stopped at the Malibu Pier the other day just to get a look at the sunset. Well the sun was hidden behind some clouds and land so the sunset was not that great. We managed to grab a few drinks and wander down the pier for a spell. Plenty of action on the pier, and what looks like a pretty nice place to eat. Well worth the 45 minutes or so we visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavisS_13
40,Best value in town,"I come to the pier to eat whenever I have a visitor from out of town because not only is the food delicious and organic but you get a real feel of being out on the ocean. Admittedly the chairs are awful...plastic and uncomfortable... (the biggest problem), but otherwise it's a great place to eat and especially in the summer when you can sit outside until 9pm. Winter you have to get there before 5 to get any views.So in winter, go for lunch. The food is simple but healthy and you can't beat the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianabD1981GE

30,It's a pier,"We've been to most of the piers in Southern California. I think most of the others are just as good. This does have a restaurant out in the pier and another at the base of the pier but on a summer Saturday the wait foe either was close to two hours. Parking is next to impossible to find. If you are already nearby it is certainly worth a visit but not worth a special trip, unless you are going at an "" off "" time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/So_Cal_Illini_81

50,A Gorgeous Must See Spot,"You simply cannot go to LA without seeing the Malibu Pier. I would get there early, at least on a weekend, because parking can be at a premium. There is a lot right there, but it is not very big. Expect to pay, too, it's not free. You might also find parking alone the highway.We enjoyed going onto the pier and taking pictures of the beautiful ocean and looking back at the awesome homes on the hills. Most people are willing to take your family's picture and it's always nice to return the favor.At the end of the pier is the Malibu Farm Cafe. It's a nice, casual dining spot with some healthy options. You don't need to spend a whole afternoon here, just an hour or so will do, depending on if you decide to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
30,Pacific Coast Highway is a beautiful drive,"While in the Los Angeles area waiting for a wedding reception my wife and I drove the Pacific Highway for Highway 27 up through Malibu, saw the pier, beach and shops along the way.

40,Great Pier and the walk to it,"Park at Malibu McDonalds (not sure how long you can stay for, we where on vacation and don't care), walk along the front it takes about 10 minutes. Pleasant Malibu walk (Nobu restaurant looks nice) and then spend a bit of time on the beach and pier well worth it, but I prefer Santa Barbara pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard

50,If You Don't Visit the Malibu Pier Then You Missed The Best of Cali,"The Malibu Pier is synonomous with big Hollywood stars, glamour, surfing and Bay Watch. If you drive Highway 1 and don't go here why would you drive HWY 1 in the first place. In other words this is a MUST DO. My wife and I went to the pier for lunch a few years ago and we looked out the restaurant and Arnold The Governator was looking back at us. Pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Pier and beach are just a great local!,"The beach was great that day, the parking - which a problem normally in that area- was easy and reasonable ($8) right on the beach side. There are showers, toilets, great golden sand , swimming and surfing area. Too bad the life guard did not allow buggie boarding in the surfing area, where the waves were. The crowd was mixed between some locals and tourists. Watch out for the Seaguls, as they will steal your food very quickly without you knowing. The back drop of Malibu pier is great and photographic. And don't forget the view of the hills as the landscape decorated with beautiful homes and some mansions. Walk under the pier as the view changes with the time of the day and the sun coming through. There are few restaurants and fast food close by, there a cafe on the pier top floor and a store for some souvenirs . You also can see across the ocean to Santa Monica and byoned .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barry684

30,"Great views, nice restaurants, beautiful pier but terrible parking and environs","I hated going to this pier as the parking was so bad and this part of PCH is really not the prettiest one. So no points for all this. But the actual pier is really pretty and we absolutely loved the restaurant and the shop in the end of it, so average points sum up to three as I would give five points to the pier alone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila

20,Nice breeze,"The Malibu pier is a waste of your time. If you want a cool breeze and a nice vibe with a couple drinks, go for it. Bring a sweatshirt even in the summer. But it's not a good place to eat dinner considering the myriad options available. You'll pay $10 or $15 to park, walk a couple hundred feet, and discover the options are limited to swanky organic overpriced garbage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183ng

30,"Bus it, it's cheaper than parking","We took the 534 from Santa Monica, traffic is traffic whether you're in a bus or car. The pier is pretty, we didn't eat. You can fish, but there are game wardens, so learn the rules. Beach is ok, although we seemed to be there on a sea slug day. Water is cool. Not many amenities. There's a lady selling water and chips near the small beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanamasha

20,Beware of the Parking Attendant!,"I visited the Malibu pier yesterday and parked in the lot adjacent to it. Well aware of the $5/30-minute charge, I made sure to exit well ahead of my 1st thirty minutes expiring. My ticket had me clocking in at 10:48; I got to the exit at 11:09 - which was the time punched by attendant...21 minutes in my calculations. The parking attendant tried to charge me $10, saying I went was into my 2nd 30-minutes (he even had a calculator!). I told him ""no"" - I still had plenty of time remaining. He continued to argue w/me, insisting I needed to return to the attendant at the entry gate to argue my case. Wasn't going to do that because I knew they were scamming me. He refused to take my payment...and since he wouldn't take my $5 payment, I had to drop it out my window so that I could leave. These guys were out to make extra $$$...watch 'em!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinf967
30,A lovely coastal drive to get here,"Did it more to bring back memories - I used to enjoy the drive on the Pacific Coast Highway from Santa Monica and loved the ocean views and the canyons as backdrops - had a favourite restaurant called Granita but its probably years since it was there. The pier seemed a thing to do, probably like any other pier but did enjoy the ocean and sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonWamberal
30,"Checked it out, and checked the list, no need to go back","It is what it is. Gotta check it out once. But $12 to park and not really much to see.

On to the rest of the tourist compulsories...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackin614
40,"So many piers, so little time","This is a lovely pier, one should stop unless one has already seen the other innumerable piers along the PAC.

40,surprisingly not overrun with tourists,"Good place to hang out after the Getty Villa closes and you're doomed by the traffic and you bring up Google Maps and it's a red pin cushion.There are two Malibu Farms locations here, one close to the road (which seems to be inhabited by tragically hip locals) and one at the end of the pier with very friendly locals and internationals. We went to the end and had really good burgers and seafood and watched the sun go down both literally and on our hopes of getting back to our place before 10 p.m. People were fishing for mackerel from the pier and having really good luck.The pier combines some of the best things about California -- good food, great nature, and a low-key ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgesHenri
30,Just okay.,They are in the process of repairing the pier so it wasn't as picturesque as I had planned with a big crane parked on the pier. A little pricey for what it is. Maybe wait until after the renovations are done?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/khoward67
40,Package Deal,"Visit Malibu Cafe to get $39.00 off the parking ticket. We arrived about 9:30 am on a Monday and had the entire beach and pier to ourselves. We saw otters, dolfins, and many birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McHove
50,You can see for miles and miles,"We pulled in and parked at the Malibu Pier's parking lot. It cost $10 but we planned on checking out the pier and the nearby beaches.There is Malibu Farms restaurant at the beginning of the pier that has indoor and outdoor seating with views of the beach and the ocean.At the end of the pier there is the Malibu Farms cafe and a nice gift shop.The end of the pier was a great spot to gaze out over the ocean on this calm, warm, sunny day. There were seagulls and Pelicans flying and people surfing and paddle boarding.The views are amazing.This was a great way to spend an hour before heading out to explore the nearby beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bombersfly10
30,Food and views,"The pier itself is nothing special, especially with so many other things to do in Malibu, but it does play host to Malibu Farm, a wonderful spot to have breakfast or lunch before setting off on a canyon hike. There are two locations at the start and end of the pier, both serving the same menu. Grab a seat outside to take in the coastal views amid sounds of the waves on shore.Food is well prepared farm-to-table cuisine. We'd highly recommend the Lobster Breakfast Burrito and the breakfast pizza looked very interesting, too.Once you've eaten too much, head up to any one of the parks or nearby Getty Villa for a long stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/byronr636
50,The Lovely Malibu ..,Malibu has the best views! The pier is fun and a great experience while in Malibu. Parking can be hard to find but its worth the trip! The photography is amazing at sunset.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustSydney123
40,Paradise,Definitely spectacular regarding view and scenery but not to go there if you're hungry or want to do more than just walk. Honestly I prefer Santa Monica Pier but surely is a place to see once in a lifetime.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/367Sheila367
40,interesting walk,"The best part of the pier is the view of the surfers off the point. Lots of ,anglers on the pier and watching them catch salt water fish is fun and educational. particularly for a fresh water angler. Parking in this area was limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishingdavep
40,Pretty commercial and pretty views,Stopped on the PCH to view the historic pier. Restaurants at either end looked delicious and used local ingredients. No prices shown on interior blackboard menus that I could see so put off. Pretty sea views and views back to coast. Worth stopping for.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonE857
40,Beautiful stroll,A very low key stroll on the smaller pier. Parking is $10. There is a site that rents fishing poles but the restaurant out on the end closes at 4:00 pm do i would get there before that for the best view. Malibu farm restaurant at the base of the pier is open later and is wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rossdmd
30,Malibu Pier,"It has a great pacific ocean view and some ""Santa Monica"" park's mountains. It is not as Santa Monicas pier neither has that many thigs to do! If you are looking for ocean water and a view it is the place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SheliCG
50,Do I have to?,"It's Malibu. It's the pier. It's on Santa Monica Bay in the Pacific Ocean. It's served as the site for many films. Once you get there you'll recognize it from one of your favorites. Come hungry for lunch and eat at one of the restaurants on the pier. My burger was beyond excellent A bit pricey for a burger, but worth it for the experience. And the drive to and from is magnificent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dentldoc
50,Spectacular,"We went on December 31 during the day. It was so clear, the weather was amazing. We ate at the Malibu Farms which was delicious. Had cauliflower pizza that was fantastic. Great bloody Mary's. Beautiful views of the ocean",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Romance2016
30,Pier for a short walk,This pier is not very huge- small and nice. I preferred to visit this pier as I live pretty close from here. Reaching and getting away from traffic on Pacific coastal highway takes time. It has one or two coffee shops - restaurants on the pier which seemed utterly busy on weekend - I went on Saturday. The one at the entrance looks fancy and love to try that on my next visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mytexperience
30,Park outside. Its a small pier,"Reviewing only the pier and nothing else...The only thing good about it is the 2 restaurants there. The cafe at the entry and the restaurant at the end. Very pretty.But other than those 2, its just a pier.But the view is amazing. Theres lots of fishing pole hooks. Theres parking on the road. Rental kayaks nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jangjangjang
40,Historic pier with two restaurants,"This pier is in the heart of old Malibu, a short walking distance from historic Adamson House. Malibu Colony, and Malibu Lagoon State Park are also close by. There are two dining areas for the restaurant, Malibu Farm, one at each end of the pier. Indoor and al fresco tables are available. The seaward side dining is usually more crowded, but the landward end is warmer and less windy. There is scant parking along the Pacific Coast Highway, so if you go on a weekend for brunch, parking might be difficult. Early breakfast at Malibu Farm is the best time to avoid crowds. By 10 am seating and parking are almost full.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
50,Nice to Relax,Great place to stop during a Sunday drive up the coast. When you enter the pier there is a great restaurant flanking both sides of the walk way. As you walk down the long board walk people stand all the railings fishing. At the end of the pier is another restaurant facing the ocean. This is a good spot the catch the sun set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Osaze06
50,I got a chance to read a book on the beaches of malibu!,Im a avid reader and this was a bucket list place to just experience it. I felt like I was in an episode of moesha as we rode along th epier! lol,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jadaSpecialKiss
30,So What's the Big Deal?,"There are better views from dozens of other piers up and down the coast, parking is nearly impossible and is expensive, there are no bathrooms except for a filthy port-o-potty or if you are a restaurant patron they'll give you the key to their bathroom, and if you dare to walk near the road you'll be targeted by crazy motorists or aggressive bicyclist packs. The only thing worth doing here is watching the action at Surfrider Beach. For a better view and more interesting surroundings take a ride through nearby Pepperdine University and drive to the top of campus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GuyFromAtlanta_GA
40,pretty sight to see...,"We went there on a cloudy day so we couldn´t take full advantage of the views because was kind of foggy, but it´s really pretty in spite of it all... and it has benches so you can sit and drink your warm latte!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rosaide70
50,A must to visit if in the Malibu area,"Whether a sunny day or cool, dark evening, the pier has so much to offer in the way of views, sounds, food and fun. Watching the locals fish, viewing the twinkling lights up in the mountains at night, feasting on delicious foods at Malibu Farm, or viewing the memorabilia (Gidget!) in the gift shop, it is time well-spent here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieL636
40,A Malibu landmark and worth a visit.,"Has a great view of the coastline, and I used to go fishing there when I was younger. Free and a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1jjarecki

40,Great end to Malibu,"Had a great drive from Santa Monica up to Malibu and then back to Malibu Pier, great views and great location made it a worthwhile trip especially in a convertable mustang!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diveboy77
20,Not much to see/do,"We did not eat at the restaurant - so our 'experience' is quite limited -- because, other than we did take advantage of one of the benches to enjoy the sun and the breeze, there isn't much else to review!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardB562
40,Good outlook from Malibu Pier,"Nice views, but didn't rate the restaurant as previously reviewed. Park the car up (on the street if you can to save $s) and wander down to the and then onto it. Nice watching the water sports happening. I'd imagined lots of surf, but certainly the day we visited that wasn't the case.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiwiKerry53
50,Amazing food!,This pier has amazing restaurants. Great for brunch and the views are amazing. Parking is easy with the valet and the view is spectacular. We had an amazing breakfast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robink34
30,Nice break in the pacific coast drive,"My husband and I stopped here during our drive up the pacific coast. There is some street parking, otherwise you have to pay $10 to park in the lot. It's a nice place to stop, take pictures and go to the Malibu Farm or restaurant. There is also a little shop at the end of the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meghanm672
40,Go For Sunset,One of a very good places to visit in LA. Take a drive on Malibu road towards SF for few miles in the evening and stop at this place for nice sunset view. Should be chosen over Santa Monica if you are confused between these 2 places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imhuzefa
50,Great place for a gorgeous view!,"I highly recommend visiting Malibu and its gorgeous views. Its no Florida beaches thats for sure, but it does carry its own theme and feeling. We drove through here and stopped at a few spots to take pictures, I highly recommend checking it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dackp
30,Checked off our list,We enjoyed our visit to the pier. Finding a parking space was a challenge. Luckily we don't mind walking. There wasn't anything spectacular about it but since we had seen the pier in several tv shows and movies we put it on our list of things to see/do while on our Pacific Coast Highway road trip and LA stay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeAndMyLens
50,Good for a relaxing Stop,Excellent place to stop to view the ocean and people watch. Much quieter and more relaxed than Santa Monica Pier. Parking is located close by ($10 I think) if you can not get a space on the road. Beautiful spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RichardT216
50,Lovely pier with wonderful views,"Much quieter and laid back than the Santa Monica Pier which is an absolute zoo. Wonderful place to take a stroll, sit and look at the ocean, beach, birds. There is a nice shop near the end with high quality T-shirt gifts plus a laid back farm restaurant at the end of the pier. We actually ate lunch outside at the restaurant on the beach end of the pier-- with divine views-- but heard it has since closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lrising
40,peace pefect peace,This is a chilling area to be. Not so busy and the beachesare short and sweet. Plenty of surfers to gaze at just around the bay!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie5gig
50,Magical,The view of the sun setting in the sea from this point is sheer magical.The light is beautiful. A very serene landscape to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/atifpeshimam
50,Excellent views!!!,Views are excellent and while there you should eat at Paradise Cove Cafe ... the specialty drinks are amazing and the food is delicious. A bit more than a mid range price but a lot of food for the money. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/70crystalt
50,Picturesque Malibu,"If you want to walk along a pier, watch fisherman and have a great meal, Malibu Pier has it all. The Farm and Casa Escobar are both easy walking distance from the pier and the bast part of all is watching the surfers at Malibu Surfrider Beach vying for waves. Stand up paddle boards and kayaks are available to rent at nearby surf shops. On a warm sunny day, it is gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherLA55
40,One of the better piers to visit in Southern California,"Not nearly as big, touristy or as kitschy as Santa Monica -- and therefore much more accessible. Great view of Surfrider Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
50,Great fun and nostalgic too!,"I lovely place to go solo or with family or friends. Beautiful place to swim or just walk the pier and take in the sights. My daughter and I are movie fiends so we ""attempted"" to recreates scenes from the X-Files in August 2014 as well as the movie, ""The Net"" that were shot on location there. Had a ball!! Plus the little restaurant that boasts ""the end of Route 66"" has great food!!! If you're in Santa Monica, take the time to just walk and enjoy the Pier!! And oh yes! You can't forget that Sharknado was filmed there too!! Be ever watchful for those pesky flying sharks!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/842deborahr
30,Not much here!,"There's really not a whole lot to say about the pier alone. Malibu, however, is a great community to go people watching and visiting nearby local sights and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LetsGetOut
30,Malibu Pier,"Just a pier with great views and dinning, no attractions, rides, etc. Had lunch at the pier very expensive $13 for a BLT sandwich, but the bacon was maybe the best bacon I have ever had, from an organic restaurant. Look to the North side of the of pier and you can just hear the theme song from Two and a Half Men television show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cndwhite2308
50,Beautiful,"Beautiful views and a great beach. Picnic, drive, jog, walk. Must visit for everyone once in your life",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alivslj
40,If you've never been it's a nice stop in the Bu!,"Things I love about Malibu pier… It's so Malibu!!! At the end of the pier you have a nice little gift shop with all the Malibu local clothing items and other trinkets for sale. Across from that you can grab a bite or fresh juice from Malibu Farms… I don't think the food is the best but it's not that either. Either way it makes for a very special experience as it truly is farm fresh food. It's see yourself at the restaurant so you can get a nice view of the paddle borders and surfers and a great view of the infamous Malibu pier!Parking can be a bit of a nightmare depending on what time you arrive. They do have self parking/self paid parking but that lot fills up quickly they have a spillover light is well… Again that particular area can be a bit traffic jammed depending on whether you're coming on the weekend or a holiday. Directly across the street there's also a few restaurants if you don't feel like eating on the pier. There are also plenty of paddle boarding, surfing, and wetsuit rental shops nearby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissD819
40,Iconic attraction in LA,"NIce view, and a traditional sight for any LA visitor. It may be too crowded sometimes, but it is worth seeing at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marclaudi
50,A day on the pier,"Enjoying the cool breeze while standing on the pier was enchanting. The smell of the ocean filled the breeze as the tide moved in and out on the shore, challenging the surfers that were trying to ride the waves. The shops on the pier offered beach themed collectors items and clothing; and the food was very tasty (and organic). The view could be enjoyed from inside the cafe, or outside on first or second level seating. While I stood on the pier, my family enjoyed running in and out of the water along the shoreline. This experience was definitely an enjoyable one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mombcop
50,Malibu Pier,Great restaurant on the end of the pier. A bit pricey but this is Malibu! Nice walk out on the pier and can watch the surfers...dolphins...seagulls and possibly sea lions too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se
40,Awesome Wood Pier with a Gift Shop & Restaurant at the End,This is a really cool wooden pier that is fun to walk and people watch. The end of the pier has a very cool little store and a great restaurant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SirTravelLover
50,Lovely,"The views are amazing. Arrived quite early in the day so managed to park flies to the pier. Spent a couple of hours here. Had a coffee at the cafe on the end of the pier and did'nt do anything at all. Just sat and watched. Watched the sea, the birds, the waves, the surfers and the people. Lovely way to spend a morning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BW119

50,Malibu is amazing!!,Oh my! my love for the Malibu pier is unconditional! I always have an amazing time when I visit this place! Talk about peer serenity and peace! The water is so Amazing! I'm never usually a fan of getting in the Pacific Ocean lol because it's always so cold but this beach just makes me want to jump in! The energy is always so nice and chill and the people that work at the restaurants are always very professional and welcoming! Sometimes people have that feeling that you will get that snooty kind of attitude because it's Malibu..although that may be the case in some spots I've yet to experience it! The traffic is beyond nuts but it's worth it all in the end!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BugattiBoi88
30,Nice Pier,Nice pier with lots of fun things to see and do. Malibu is a nice little town. Don't miss this when in Cali,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresamd0906

30,"It's a Pier, but it's Malibu","If you are driving through Malibu, it's probably worth a stop to take a look and a walk around, but I would not make a special trip. It's a small pier with a bar/restaurant and, of course, the ocean view. You'll see some folks fishing off the pier and maybe some surfers along the beach. At the time we were there, Coors was filming a commercial in the bar area of the patio. That was kind of cool to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globetraveler30
50,SURFS UP,"Where do I start? The weather was perfect and watching the surfers was really cool. This is a perfect place to stop off, stretch your legs, catch some rays, and get some free entertainment, (surfers). I have personally never surfed before, but it looked like so much fun. My husband and I witnessed a young girl, maybe about 16 years old, attempt the waves on a paddle board for her first time, that was interesting. I wanted to try it as well but we were heading up the coast to San Francisco at the time and only stopped off to watch some surfers before continuing on our way. Not sure everyone is interesting surfing but we enjoyed it! The air was warm but the water was cold while we were there, ( mid-June). I would definitely recommend stopping here for a small break while traveling, sunning, watching surfer's battle the waves or actually taking a paddle board lesson yourself. It was a nice relaxing time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/215catharinea
50,Loved it,Nothing better than sitting with a ocean view and gulping your cold beer. The place offers a good view along with few restaurants. Must visit if you visit Malibu..!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geet219
40,Pier is Pretty Good for what it is ...,"This is the Classic pier seen in the movies. It is pretty simply the pier without much trimmings of extras. There's the restaurant on the end & guys are fishing off of the pier sides. No arcades of merry-go-rounds here, just the Pier seen in 'Chinatown' & 'Devil in a Blue Dress' & many other movies. Enjoy it for the views and what it is...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Overrated,"Based on some review books we read, we thought we would spend half a day in Malibu and some of our time at the Malibu Pier. What a surprise it was for us to learn that there is very little to do at the Pier. When we finally found parking in Malibu, we spent about a half hour on the pier. Save your time and head to Santa Barbara or San Luis Obispo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RBookout
50,An Oasis in an Oasis,"Malibu was a hideaway along Pacific Coast Highway when it was a winding, narrow roadway north of Santa Monica,The pier is its most iconic landmark with its twin end buildings. A short stroll along it brings one to the end with a great view on a clear day of Santa Catalina Island 26 miles at sea.One can imagine one of the stars of the Silver Screen during Hollywood's Golden Age looking out into the ocean, maybe watching rouge gambling ship skirting the authorities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L5112CDrichards
40,Beautiful Views,Our family enjoyed walking the pier and the views while traveling through Malibu recently. We paid to park in the lot beside the pier entrance for its convenience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeslieinTN
40,"Beautiful for watching the sunset, the surfers or having a meal","First of all, understand that this is not Santa Monica. Malibu is somewhat sleepy with a handful of shops, some good restaurants but most miles of gorgeous beaches. If you need entertainment this probably isn't a good choice but if you are looking for a great view and a stroll, this is an excellent choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPeery

40,Picturesque! Amazing Coastline!,"Malibu Pier was a lovely place to go for a relaxing walk. Compared to Santa Monica pier, we found it quite quiet, with just a few restaurants and shops. Lots of fishermen trying to catch their dinner. From the pier you can see right down the coastline,with lots of multi-million dollar beach homes perched on the edge of the sandy cliffs. Just stop and gaze out at the ocean, with unobstructed views. The organic farm at the end was pretty busy so we just had a drink. Lovely location. Lovely way to spend a few hours! Easy parking on the road...possible short walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryH22

50,Beautiful as the sun sets,"This is a lovely long pier. Nice to stroll late afternoon and watch the sunset. If you want the Pier in your photo, I recommend standing down by the Malibu Beach Inn which isn't far and get your photos there. You will get the water lapping on the shore, the pier and the sunset all in your photo. We stood ON the pier at sunset and then walked back to the Malibu Beach Inn carpark for more photos. There is a restaurant and I think shops on this pier, but we didn't investigate. The scenery and view from the pier along the coast is beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCandWH

40,I was looking forward to the organic food at Malibu Farm but...,"Malibu Farm restaurant looked like a good choice for our late lunch in Malibu after checking into our AirBnB, but when we arrived we were told only outdoor tables were available for unreserved tables. No problem, we thought and proceeded outside only to be told by yet another employee that we had to go upstairs to the upper deck to find a table. We did that and just as we sat down, another employee told us we had to move. By this time we decided we were not really welcome there and left. The good news is the restaurant at the other end of the pier, nearer the PCH, was welcoming and gave us a lovely table near the surf. They even turned on the outdoor heater when the wind blew up and offered me a blanket to wrap around my shoulders. The staff could not have been more gracious. We were told later that the same owner has both restaurants. Food was excellent. We went back with a large family party the next day for brunch and had a similar experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassiam52
40,Good to walk and check out the shops,"The pier is nice for a stroll and has some nice shops down at the end.

The pier is really clean and well maintained just nice to walk along and grab a meal. Access to the pier is also free. Worth the drive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngieG169
50,Breathtaking views abound,I loved strolling on and near this historic landmark. It is surrounded by many great little side day trips and plenty of fine eateries. At high tide the waves are gorgeous to view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TiffMateas

40,Nice view,"The Malibu pier is nice, it has a great view, but the beach was not that exciting, when we got to the beach next to the pier we wanted to get into the sea but there was a warning sign that said the sea was contaminated and swimming was banned, at least you were surfing. So we wanted to rent some surfboards and we could find anywhere to rent them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/858isabellac
40,Excellent lunch restaurant at the end of the pier,"Perfect spot for an organic but delicious lunch. Great food, staff and wonderful view! Also a top spot to enjoy a drink in the sun. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nlbelboy
40,nice location but not like Santa Monica Pier,"If you're looking for a lot of activity, go to Santa Monica & not Malibu. However, if you want a nice quite place & like to walk the pier, I recommend this pier. Be prepared to spend some money for parking & food while there. Both are a little pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam651
50,there are fish....big fish.,quite clean crowd free....as the sun goes down the sharks come in to feed.Spent many a night and day fishing this great pier.....usually no body else was therebut it was January to May (best time to visit) shark fishing was great (catch and release only)you just have to watch your hand as they like to turn around and bite your for arm....it does hurt.too bad it's not far enough north for the water to sparkle in that blue ocean way.....here it is still muddy.....in fact all the way to Oxnard.....the pier by Hurst mansion and Santa Barbara pierare by far the best....don't even ask me about Santa Monica pier or the board walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfarrell_smash
30,Small & Quite Little Pier,"The trip from LA to Malibu is very nice, do expect traffic as you head toward Malibu as there was road construction in Oct. 2014. Once you arrive at Malibu Pier, expect a very laid back stroll. It is beautiful and low key, especially compared to Santa Monica Pier. You can have a nice lunch on the pier, or maybe an ice cream cone. You have to pay to park and walk a bit, but it is a pleasant little pier. Don't expect much if you are looking for excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheKnow22
50,Busy doing nothing,Just to stand on the pier and gaze out to sea was brilliant. We did this on our last day in CA and watched surfers and swimmers and wished like anything that we could stay longer. Simple gifts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer803637

You can see the beautiful views, look down in the water, watch the fisherman, and maybe see a seal. There are at least 2 restaurants on the pier and several accross the street, if you want to catch a meal. You can park along the road for free or pay $10.00 to park right next to the pier. Additional public beaches and parks are nearby. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinkHollowFarm
40,Beautiful Sunsets,"We drove through Malibu 27 miles looking for the rich and famous, didnt see anyone but it was a lovely drive. Make sure you stop and walk onto the beaches to look back at the beach houses, they are amazing. Sat on the Pier watching the sun set watching the local surf, a memory that I will never forget, it was so peaceful. Entrance to the pier is free and it is worth walking to the very end and set and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennyrU8909DX

50,20 mins from LA madness,"This is a utopia on earthy!! The cafe has a great brunch menu and you can eat as you watch the waves, sea lions and surfers roll out in front of you on the Pacific.

50,Olde Worlde Charme,"Funny isn't it, that victorians (c.1900) loved to walk over the sea on boardwalks. Well so much has changed, but that delight to walk over the sea remains. This one is a good one, not crowded when we were there (a thursday in October), some restaurants here, it appears, by the crowds, that the one right over the sea is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stopeter44

50,Malibu trip,"This is a great place to take in the views of Malibu from the end of the pier. A lot of people come here to fish, so if you're into fishing don't forget your fishing rod!

30,"Not much to do, the views are stunning though.","We went on Malibu pier for the view, the view is stunning, this pier was made in 1908, there is not a lot to do here apart from look at the ocean and people watch. If you fish then there are lots of areas for you to do this on the pier. There is also a busy restaurant at the end which didn't look that clean so we gave it a miss.The views are stunning though and it's safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonip1966
40,"Eat,walkabout or try your luck fishing","Great surf shop at the end.Decided not go fishing ,however the locals great to talk with who were fishing.Not too much going on.

The retaurant food smelled great coming from the kitchen as we strolled by ,next trip will try a meal there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent414
20,Run down..too bad,"Unfortunately the pier seems to have fallen on hard times and so there really wasn't anything going on when we were there. Looked like someone was trying to reopen the restaurant. Hope they do and it is successful as it was kind of a sad contrast to the energy at the Santa Monica Pier. Still a nice walk out to the end of pier, just disappointing you couldn't get a drink or coffee and sit to further enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/674JohnL674

40,Kids loved it. Find Julio,"Kids loved malibu pier for the fishing. They do rent everything you need at the end of the pier. Try to find Julio (lovely high school student) who has been amazing with my kids teaching them how to fish. Note, There's little else to do for kids than fish and watch surfers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0cv
40,What I picture when I think of Malibu,I feel like I've seen it before in some movie or TV show. It's definitely worth a walk to the end. You feel like you're walking on a piece of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/404emilyc
40,Perfect small beach near the pier,Great little swimming beach near the pier. Not much of a surf but the water was crystal clear. There were many families and young children taking advantage of the gentle waves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shanti03
50,Fun family Pier,We spent some time on Malibu Beach. Didn't want to get into the cold water so we walked to the pier and walked around for a bit. Looks like a fun place especially if you had young children with you. Plenty of places to get drinks and food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gobluestl
50,Great phot ops when visiting Malibu,"The Malibu Pier was a great way to unwind for a bit. I was sorry that we had just eaten, because there were several nice-looking options for meals. If we return, we will definitely check out one of these restaurants. There was also an adorable speed boat for a photo op for small children to ""ride"" on the pier. My 2-year-old loved it.The surrounding scenery was beautiful, and as I look at my pics, I can't decide which one I like more.There is also a staircase down to the beach, and great viewing of the surfers (but there are also designated areas for swimmers).All in all, it was a great way to spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorkTravelMom
40,A Lovely Pier on Pacific Coast Highway 1. Well worth a stop.,Stopped off in Malibu on way south on Pacific Coast Highway 1 (PCH1) and very glad I did as the pier was lovely.Okay it's just a pier but it is well maintained and the walk down to the end in the Californian sunshine looking at the beautiful blue ocean was great. At the start and end of the pier there are some nice whitewashed buildings and the food looked very good (a shame I had already eaten).There are people fishing from the pier but unlike with the pier in Ventura further north along PCH1 they seem to keep the pier cleaner as there was far less 'fish mess' than on the Ventura Pier.Well worth a short stop and a walk (only need 1/2 to 1 hour) but a great break from driving and there are plenty of bench's along the pier to stop and take in the stunning vista's.See photo's included with this review.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
40,"Huge waves, beautiful area","We came on peak wave day, watched the surfers in the distance and had some spectacular waves crashing underneath and around the pier. Enjoyed the restaurant on the pier as well, good food and very accommodating of our large family/children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loftinspace
40,Nice Pier - good restaurant offerings,We visited the pier one night to have dinner and enjoy a sunset. I enjoyed seeing the fisherman trying to catch fish while we ate - cheap entertainment! The pier has been nicely reconstructed and a nice place to visit if you're in the Malibu area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epi007
30,Hard to park so drive down a bit.,"When looking for the pier we couldn't find a parking spot, so we kept driving South and noticed a sign that said ""Coastal Access"" and parked. There were stairs and we spent an hour walking along the beautiful beach looking at the multi-million dollar homes. The beach was empty and the sand beautiful. Don't bother the residents, but enjoy the beauty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlyGuy21
20,Just a pier...,Malibu BEACH is awesome.The PIER... on the other hand is nothing to write home about. You can see the ocean like any other pier. It's small and there may be people fishing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaidi

10,"Abandoned, What A Shame!","The Pier is old, and the state has promised for years to fix it up. The two restaurants there are closed. The only thing there is a nice small gift shop. It is pointless to go there. Free parking is hard to get.You would have to pay $10 to $20 parking, just to walk up and down water damaged, bird fesses covered wood planks?You are better off going to Santa Monica Pier, at least there you will get lots of entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/felixb651
40,Calm,"If you looking for calm pier this is a good one. There is a restaurant at the end of pier facing ocean. It is next state beach. There is Malibu lagoon which beautiful with birds. Also at shore there couple of big pebbles/stones on the beach, where you can see live sea animals.Parking is expensive and difficult to get on a peak day. This pier is shown in couple movies for example taken 2 climax scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TadA232
30,A Pier without Peers ?,"As far as Piers go this one is pretty sad I'm afraid. Santa Monica, Brighton & even Glenelg Pier all have a little bit more pizzazz ! It's great to see the public can fish off it but apart from a good coffee spot that's about it. Maybe it needed a sunny day but it was still a relaxing spot. I'm afraid it is also not the 'Rockford Car Park' , that's further north at a pay to enter car park !! Jimbo would not be happy !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skeney57

40,Must visit,If you're in LA its a short drive up the coast. Great photo spot! Parking is limited so be prepared to search and shell out some cash.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thepole007
40,Nice stop-off if touring,A charming and very-well maintained pier with a nice cafe at the end. Good views looking back to the shoreline. And if you're into fishing - or want to try it - you can rent everything you need as well as get some good tips along the way. The Malibu Coast is dominated by private shorelines and only rarely broken with public access - this is a good place to enjoy if you're touring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
40,nice walk and scenic view,"The restaurant was closed but it sounded good, farm fresh, organic and local. We would probably eat there sometime if it were open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenB982
20,Waste of time,"I came here because travellers advised it. But in my opinion, it was such a waste of time. Malibu is a very quiet place and boring. There was nothing at the pier, the cafe was closed, restaurant same and the souvenir shop was just rubbish!! Santa Monica is so much better for sure!! At least, I know what Malibu looks like now and I'll definitely not go back there!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoraC572
40,Incredible views!,"We were driving through and decided to park and walk down the pier.

It was an enjoyable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoyW750

30,Awesome cafe on the end of the pier,"The pier itself does not have much on it, but in my opinion if there is a pier you have to walk to the end and back. Getting to the end we found a cafe where we had lunch - Malibu farm shop. Wow the food was great ( although it was really busy and the food took ages to come out) who can argue though when you are waiting while looking out to sea.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AS185
50,Amazing Scenic Spot!,"Drove up and down the Pacific Coast Highway taking the beautiful sights of Malibu.The Pier is a beautiful spot to look back Malibu Beach and the mountains.

10,Don't waste your time or money,"Seriously, go to Santa Barbara Pier or Huntington Beach Pier instead, this place sucks. Both have more class, better beaches around them and you won't get ripped off or hustled. Tourist trap, end of review",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveT705
40,"Good view, less people","At this time of the year, not to shiny but with breeze, good to hang out alone or with friends or with family. Not to many visitors around. there's a cafe, didn't have chance to try. but seems nice",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562yingl
50,"Must see, for film buffs especially!","If you are a fan of Forrest Gump, this is somewhere you really must visit. Malibu pier is where Forrest stops running and turns round to go home again. Cool place to visit, we went here on a tour so had limited time but still enjoyed it and it was great to say I have followed in Forrest's footsteps. Restaurant was closed when we were there and had been for a while so may be a good ideal to bring food with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voodoochilled1
50,Loved it!!,"The drive from woodland hills was beautiful. We loved just watching the surfers. Park just before the actual pier parking it was only $3.or on the street for free.

50,Don't miss the opportunity...,We went out on this pier twice on our visit to Malibu. It was nice to be able to go out on the ocean and not have to take a boat. There were two pelicans that greeted us. They just sat there and let people take their picture with them. We love to view nature and the outdoors. There is a gift shop at the end of the pier that has really unique gifts and souvenirs. It is different than the normal souvenirs that you see everywhere you go. The restaurant/café was not open. It was under construction. I think it will be much nicer when that is up and running. People were fishing from the pier and it was just a nice way to enjoy the ocean. We recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255sherij
50,Great spot for bird watching,I loved walking here in the early morning hours with my husband. We were fortunate to see a rare Arctic loon last January. The shop at the end of the pier has great gifts. Well worth the walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisMcNeil2013
20,Business on the pier are closed,"Took a walk on the pier in July, 2013. Surprisingly all business on the shore end and one of two on the ocean end are closed. I suspect the owners are asking excessive rent. This was a disappointment for such a fantastic location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaineCascoBay

40,"Simple, relaxed with pleasant view.","Nothing exciting, but a nice stop to get a good view, enjoy the ocean breeze, and watch those anxiously awaiting pulls on their fishing lines! Monday afternoon visit, easy parking right at the pier, not crowded at this time. Restaurant wasn't open so we enjoyed our McDonalds take-out on a bench. Very pleasant - everyone keeps to themselves and no one trying to sell you their wares or services. I've heard the sunset is beautiful, but our schedule didn't allow time to enjoy... maybe next time.Relatively quick visit unless you are there to fish or watch the sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanlM8503MM
40,"Great views, pleasant breezes.","I wouldn't call this visit exciting, it is just a pleasant experience to be by the ocean and watch some boats pass in the distance, a helicopter flying low over the water or many of the sea birds flying around. The sunset shouldn't be missed, wait for it!It is one of those memories that makes you feel good and happy that you took the time to stop at this historic pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixxmom
40,Great laid back views!,"Managed to get parked close to the pier, good start!Nice laid back atmoshpere on the pier, nobody trying to sell you anything.We had been recommended to eat at the Beachcomber Restaurant, but it had been shut down and was being re-furbed. So it was a takeaway from the Jack in the Box across the road and chill on the beach for the day!Plenty space on the beach right next to the pier, watching the surfers trying to catch a wave.Great chill day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m4xwl
40,Rustic and historic,"A perfect place to watch the sunset. It is crowded during the weekends and when the surf is up. But, it is a nice place to watch the sunset. Street parking is difficult on nice days. However, if you do find parking, there are restaurants, and shops within walking distance. When visiting Malibu, walking the pier, is the quintessential ocean experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454chriss

40,No hucksters...just nice views,"Unlike other tourist piers, Malibu is a laid back, easy on the eyes place to walk out and see the sunset or views of the ocean. When we were there, a wedding party was enjoying taking pictures of each other with the ocean background. At one end is the restaurant and at the other a gift shop, but people come to fish, people watch, spot a dolphin or two or pelican. Take some time to enjoy it and not rush from one end to the other and feel you have ""done the Malibu Pier"". with patience you may see something very interesting (people and wildlife). I had read the other reviews and expected to be disappointed; however, I think they may have ""done the pier"" as opposed to enjoying it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
40,Malibu in all of it's simplicity,"The best part of the Malibu pier? It's a pier with a restaurant at one end, a gift shop at the other. In between the two ends? Just a pier. People can fish, sit, stare at the water, take pictures....whatever they want. No glitz, no glamour. Just a pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanoibelle
30,Expected More From Malibu,"This was my first visit to the Malibu area and frankly I expected more. I stopped at numerous beach areas from Malibu south to San Diego. The Malibu area would rank at the bottom of the list. Maybe that is what the residents want. I always heard how Malibu had the most expensive real estate in America but frankly most shore homes in most areas of the New Jersey shore seem nicer. That said, the Pier is still a lovely area that offers great views of the ocean and mountains; I just expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtomicReviewer
50,Malibu Pier is a must see,While in Malibu if you don't check out the Pier you are missing out. The pier has excellent ocean views and when you are at the end of the pier take the stairs up to the top of the buildings there for a great photo op of Malibu with the water in the foreground and the Mountains in the backround. Beautiful ! There is a gift shop there that has a lot of cool stuff that seems to be a little cheaper than the prices in the rest of Malibu.Hopefully some Restaurants will again appear in the two buildings that are vacant now. The pier is definitely a great place to walk to when spending some time in Malibu !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigjt12
30,Malibu,Fun place to walk out and get a view of the ocean. Was rebuilt a while back due to damage from a storm. It's classic Southern California. Parking can be difficult during the summer months.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryD879
30,Not SB or SM...,"Personally, Malibu is average because it is too mellow and not as enjoyable of a pier as many others in SoCal. I love Santa Barbara and Monica piers among others, because they both have created wonderful unique environments representative of their cities. Malibu doesn't have that sadly. Beaches are better if visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
20,Expected a lot more.,"Malibu is a nice leafy are to live, but there's just a pier there, nothing else to see or do. Maybe that's just the way the locals like it? If you don't go there, your not missing out on much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR963
40,You have to see it,This is a must see just because it has been there for a while and us easterners hear about it and wonder about it. Don't expect too much but take it all in and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Janbo47
40,NICE and QUIET,I went when there was not much going on and I loved it. Found a place to park easily. Usually it's bustling with people. Very enjoyable. Love the little gift shop where they all things GIDGET! Who is a bartender at DUKE'S on PCH. Down the street from the pier! AWESOME!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisaizhappy
40,Historic landmark that will take you just a few minutes to see.,"This place has expensive parking and is just a pier over the ocean. Stop if you have time, nothing missed if you don't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverLake2TheWorld
40,Laid back and authentic,What I would expect a real (not too touristy) good old-fashioned Californian pier should be. Unfortunately Ruby's restaurant where we had eaten in previous visits appeared to be closed. But a real chill-out of a pier nevertheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigb1999uk
20,"Limited Options, Limited Parking","Restaurant only accepted cash, no credit cards. Not much to see or do on the pier. Parking is a nightmare!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whocareswhoiam
40,small but pretty,If you are in Malibu it is worth stopping and walking on. It is too small to make it the focal point of a trip. I will visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LincolnInnVT
50,A great place to keep cool and look cool too!,Spent many summers in and around this pier. Use to have an great commercial deep sea fishing boat that left from Malibu Pier...Always a great destination by the water...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyM164
50,Get Into The Ocean Without Getting Wet!,"If you are burning up inland, a great inexpensive place to hang out is The Malibu Pier. When Westlake is over 100' the Pier is around 80'. If you like to fish for free, this is for you. You will only catch perch, croaker (throw these back because of PCBs) Mackrel, and more rarely,Halibut. Just bring a clamp style umbrella for shade, a folding chair, and laze the day away fishing in cool temps. There is a burger joint at the end of the pier and there was a restaurant, which I hear just opened again. The Pier goes out about 300 yards into the ocean and has a great view of Surfrider beach. The only thing you may have to pay for is parking, always scarce in Malibu!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445ChrisR
30,Nothing special,Restaurants and shops with no particular offers and atmosphere. Great location and view of the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrem336
30,Disappointing but still nice!,"I expected a lot more in terms of shops and restaurants, however, the pier is old and authentic. The ocean always looks wonderful and I enjoyed watching the boats. At the beginning of the pier is a nice restaurant and the wait staff was friendly despite our tiny order ( two cappucinos.) I wouldn't make a special trip to see it. Malibu is crowded and not especially welcome to tourists. We were on our way to visit friends in the Pacific Heights and we took the Pacific Coast Highway and decided to see Malibu. Not much to do there unless you are a young child.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Patroberts_11
30,Malibu Pier is not the reason to come to Malibu.,"Totally normal . I personally preferred the crowd at Santa Monica Pier, and the view/attractiveness of Manhattan Beach's pier (name?)--and both are MUCH closer to central LA/W. Hollywood. Malibu took us about an HOUR to reach and we didn't drive during any particularly bad rush hours for traffic. Malibu AREA however, is definitely worth checking out on its own if time permits. Absolutely BEAUTIFUL with tons of ops for stunningly picturesque shots of anything from lush mountains, to unique architecture to beachfront activities and landscapes. Would go back to Malibu..next time skipping the pier:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripadvicesm
50,beautiful original old vintage pier,"walking on it brings you back to the 40's and 50's...fun gift shop at the end, restaurant at the beginning, and hawaiin ice stand too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/statement96
30,More for young kids,"I took my 17 year old daughter and she thought it was very nice That beng said, the rides are really for little kids. There is not a whole lot to do other than soak in the tmosphere which is very nice. There a ton of vendors selling everything one could imagine but we really spent about an hour as there isn't much to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IVUSDR
50,awesome gift shop at end of pier,"i had a little time to spare, so walked out to the pier, and there is a nice restaurant at the begining of pier, and and awesome gift shop at the end... so really cool gifts, and awesome they sell fish bait, if your gonna fish..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patstlouismo_1963
30,Not much here. . .,"We went to the Malibu Pier our first night in town, as it came recommended by others. Thankfully we didn't spend the $10 for parking and found a spot on PCH. We walked up and down the pier and saw folks fishing (took a total of about 5 minutes) and then went to the only restaurant on the pier for dinner (Jimmy's I believe) and it was just OK and overpriced. Next time we will skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Januarybride01
30,Not much to do.,Malibu pier is a bit sketchy and has only one restaurant to have lunch. You can walk the length of the pier but there is nothing really to do except admire the beach. Nothing like the Santa Monica pier and you still have to pay for parking. Not eally worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwens11
50,fun,It felt like a step back in time - nice way to spend a few hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judishia
30,"Nice setting, but food not the greatest.",It was nice to be on the pier at night and it had a fun atmosphere. Although food and drinks are only average.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aledo99
50,Love the Pier!,How can you miss the pier in Santa Monica. Its an LAS icon. Nothing too fancy but the energy is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
20,"Glad to see the pier open, BUT restaurant was closed","Stayed at a hotel down the street, walked to the pier with the hope of getting a drink and a bite to eat, but the Resturant was closed when, according to the posted hours, should have been open (Tuesday afternoon).Been vacationing in Malibu for 19 years and know how long this pier has struggled, so glad to see it open, but hope the management of it improves so it can stay open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rexyracer
10,Where do you park.,closes early and no parking anywhere. Panhandlers abound. Thieves everywhere. Watch your back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveandlisaK
50,Awesome staff,We visited the Malibu Pier and the staff at the gift shop there were so friendly. One of them even came out on the pier and took some pictures of our family. Highly recommend!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlottes171
50,Fun for the family,"We visited in March 2012 with two 8-yr-olds and found the pier to be quite entertaining. It was a cool afternoon, but we enjoyed watching the surfers, the boats and the birds. The kids had fun doing the same. We didn't attempt to visit the restaurants, so I can't comment on that, but we had a pleasant, quiet visit to Malibu Pier. Great photo ops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellymattei
50,True relax in Los Angeles,"Malibu Pier was my most recent road biking destination. I couldn't regret it. I think it features the best ambiance of any pier in the Los Angeles area. It's a calm place, not crowded, perfectly enjoyable on a sunny saturday. Also, the beach view is astonishing and invigorating. It's a bit off the Los Angeles area, but no visitor can miss this landmark, absolutely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pvdesign
40,cool,Malibu in general is a pretty cool place to walk around. I like to go at night and have dinner at one of the many great options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darkdivine
50,Great views good restaurants,Restaurants are good with a variety of places to choose from in price high to low $$ and cuisine. Parking is easier at night. night views from the pier are really cool especially with full moon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaCA
40,fun for a walk or stroll along this short pier but not much more,"great location, fine views up and down the Malibu coast, but can be hard to park and not much going on here. nevetheless, its a fun stop to look around and to hang out for a bit in Malibu.Tip---its right next to a pretty popular surf location so you can usually enjoy watching the local surfers catch a wave!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pandpCalifornia
40,Beautiful Ocean Views on the Moonlit Malibu Pier,"Wow. I had been here in my teens, after surfing and swimming on the beach, and it seems to have changed a great deal.The pier is beautiful.It is well kept and clean and well lit. I love piers but most are for fishing and can be a bit grungy, but this was NOT the case. The shops are clean, attractive, and full of interesting ocean themed products.There are also restaurants very close. I went with friends on a full moon night and found it to be very romantic, with very beautiful ocean views. Worth seeing day or night. Next time I'm visiting during the day, I'm going to the beach as well. Downside.. parking is kind of a bear...but be patient a spot will open up. Romance value at PM (full moon required) 9+.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camfoodie
10,Nothing but planks,With the loss of the Beachcomber and Ruby's there's not much to draw you to the pier any more. Sad.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuLife
20,Both Restaurants are now closed!,"We went on December 28th, 2011 and that was the day the Beachcomber Cafe called it quits. The other restaurant down at the end of the pier, Ruby's, closed six months before. All that is left on this pier is a cute store at the end and a nice view. The adjacent beach (Surfrider) is a cute little beach. During the off-season, check for street parking before paying at the pier parking or the beach parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ro11WithIt
40,Make a pit stop for a stroll along the pier & beach,"On our road trip along the PCH, we made a whim to stop here once we saw Malibu pier sign. We were able to find street parking by luck close to the fast food joint across the pier. Views from this pier were beautiful. We spotted a couple of people kayaking and paddle boarding as they launched from the beach . At the end of the pier, there’s a cool shop selling Malibu souvenirs and fisherman getting their catch of the day. We walked under pier along to the adjacent beach watching the surfers do their thing. A very low key pier compared to other piers. Nice to take a break from driving and enjoy the coastline.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jb645
30,Fun environment - the food isn't why you are there...,"Sitting on the beach - it's great, but sometimes the music is way too loud to enjoy your friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfek617
50,Gorgeous,"Stunning, stunning, stunning. Highly reccomend. Not to be believed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnParker52
50,Very nice place by car,"We went there riding our rental car and we found a starbucks and a small supermarket on the right.was a very nice riding and very nice views, we realyy enjoyed it and we also enjoyed the graet coffee with the cake in star bucks, also the weather was great. whenver we go to LA again , we will sure go again to this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pahmed
10,horrible owners/operators,"the pier itself is fine, but the owners/operators of the boat tours and store are horrible. they have lied to me several times and always overbook their tours, so i ended up never being able to use a tour voucher i was given as a gift. they literally lied to my face and then refused to fix the situation. not to mention the pier store is extremely overpriced. worse customer service i've ever experienced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickbW720UV
10,Far from Baywatch hype,"Deceiving. Nothing to see, nothing interesting to do. Avoid the 20 miles drive from LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PLA_Travel
40,A definite must-see when you go to Malibu,"What's a trip to a seaside community without visiting either its boardwalk or the pier? Now this is NOT the longest pier in the state (Oceanside, CA has that honor) but it is significant to the history of Malibu...and just a fun place to visit. Initially it was put in as the Rindge family's personal pier but is now owned by the State of California. The pier has had its ups and downs...it is the former location of the famed Alice's Restaurant. Alice's is gone, but there are newer and trendier restaurants coming to the pier and it's also just a nice place to fish or just engage in quiet reflection...or the watch the surfer at nearby Surfrider Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertRose15
