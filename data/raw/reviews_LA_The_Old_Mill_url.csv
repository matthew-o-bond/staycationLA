50,A Surprise and a Delight.,A leisurely Sunday after Thanksgiving weekend led us to visit the museum and garden. It was recommended by a friend with young kids. It is atmospheric and welcoming. I learnt so much history on the grist mill and its founders the Friars. Outside in the grounds you see the millstone which General Pattern discovered in Huntington Gardens and it was returned to the mill. The children loved exploring both house museum and interesting gardens including the pergola. So worth a visit and the receptionist was exceptional.,mary734
50,Serene Setting in Historic 1816 Landmark,"El Molino Viejo, now referred to as The Old Mill, was built in 1816 by Father Jose Maria de Zalvidea of the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel. This former grist mill is the oldest commercial building in Southern California. El Molino Viejo has been designated a California Historical Landmark, and is one of the original ten Los Angeles County sites to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While there is not a set fee to enter, we felt compelled to leave a bit of change as a donation after walking the interesting interior and lovely grounds. The setting is lush and tranquil, the Colonial Mission Style architecture charming, and the interior worth a quick wander through. Artwork was displayed on the walls showcasing local artists. The Old Mill has provided many uses throughout its history including housing, and the Club House for the Huntington Hotel golf course. I left with a sense of serenity which the setting imparts.",Kim G
40,Historic Sight,"We stopped here during our old Route 66 drive from Chicago to Santa Monica because it was recommended in our guide book. Glad we stopped since it is such an old building (200 years). We met a very nice lady who told us about it. We did not have an appointment and didn't know about docent tours, but we felt she gave us the highlights.",LUCKYME72

40,El Molino Viejo,"The Ol Mill aldo known as ""El Molino Viejo"" is a former grist mill which was build by Father Jos√© Maria de Zalvidea in 1816. The mill used to grind corn and grain to flour. It has a well maintained garden. This place is not big but interesting.",ArieDiepen
40,A nice bit of Early California history!,El Molino Viejo (the Old Mill) was built as the first grist mill for the Mission San Garbriel over 200 years ago. It was a failure as a mill but survived the years as residence to a number of Californians. An appointment is necessary. The docent led tour is about 40 minutes to an hour. Really a perfect amount of time. You are free to wander after that. It is free but it is run by a foundation and donations are appropriate. Our group of 10 each put in $5 to give the foundation. Go and learn!!,MaryLouise H

Parking is not easy so don't go down the driveway, just park on the street.",D Lynn S

40,Very tranquil and beautiful building and garden for fans of Spanish Colonial. Free!,This lovely little building in a gorgeous garden setting is well worth visiting if you love Spanish Colonial architecture and/or history. It is the original grain mill for the San Gabriel Mission and is quite close to Huntington Library and Gardens and is a nice add on to a visit. The displays are somewhat sparse but there is nice California art. Free!,Janhuss
