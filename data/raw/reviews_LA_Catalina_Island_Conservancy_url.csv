50,Great Way to see the Island (and Bison!),Three of us took the two hour tour and found it very interesting. Our guide seemed to know everything and and explained all very well as he drove over hill and dale. The vehicle had well cushioned seats which were very appreciated. One really needs to see Catalina outside of Avalon to fully appreciate the island; this is a must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tingold1
50,Best Way To Experience Catalina Island,"We booked the 3 hour Ecotour and it was EXCELLENT! Our tour guide was Beth, and on top of being extremely knowledgeable about the wildlife on the island, she was a great photographer and driver, if you can, try to book with her!My daughter (11 years old) and I were on a mother daughter get away and we spent a day on Catalina Island. We had found out about the conservancy through a friend and because of our love of nature and commitment to taking care of the earth, this tour seemed just for us!We learned a ton about the ecosystem of the island. We saw lots of wildlife, including bison, ground squirrels, lizards, varieties of birds and more. We learned about the plant life and saw gorgeous views all around the island.Side note for cruising visitors: We booked the 9:45 am 3-hour tour and we just made it. It was hard to judge timing of getting off the cruise ship. I think that if we booked the 9:15 am tour, we wouldn't have made it. Also, it was chilly (end of Feb 2020), make sure to dress warmly for the open air jeep ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleY423
40,Great Place!,We did a Hummer tour and it was quite an experience to tour the area. There are so many things to see that we wished we had more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethannk
50,Fantastic!,"We did the 3 hour backcountry jeep drive and had a blast. We never paid much attention to the plants, but it was very interesting to smell and taste them along the way. Our guide (Beth) was very well-versed in island history as well as all the various plants and animals that we came across.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545charlies
40,Great food!!,We had lunch -- It was so good that we returned for breakfast the next day! The rooftop seating area made our day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccook2222
50,5-person Jeep Tour Provides Natural Perspective,"Highly recommend 5-person tour versus the other bigger tour groups. Smaller group provides a more personal experience and conversations. Our tour lasted 3.5 hours even though it was advertised as a 3 hour excursion. Guide Steve took a slight detour on the return route, and we literally passed within 2-feet, face-to-face with a bison on the side of the dirt road. Can't get much more personal than that!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deedpuha
50,Great Eco-Tour of the Island,"This is a Must-Do on Catalina Island!!Our driver Louie was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. We were able to see buffalo, foxes and hidden gems such as the Ben Weston Beach.You travel in a open modified Jeep, comfortable for the driver plus 6 people. Adults kids, and teens all enjoyed the sights and learning much more about Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hruter
50,A must do on Catalina Island,The day of our tour we were contacted and told they had a Jeep breakdown and that our tour would be in a van instead. I was disappointed because I was really looking forward to riding in an open air Jeep. But the tour ended up being fantastic. We saw foxes and horses and lots of Bison. It was the highlight of our trip. We had so much fun with our guide Maria. I am going to do the tour again next time I am on the Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darlafromto
50,A Catalina must-do!,"It was either this or zip-lining for us due to time. Glad we chose the jeep tour! I was worried that 3 hours would be too long -- it wasn't. The time flew! Our tour guide has lived on the island FOREVER (decades) and shared his vast knowledge of the island with us. Sooo much to see! Tip: wear sunblock even though it's a covered jeep. We got sunburned. Also bring something to drink. Our guide kindly provided us with the tiny water bottles, but you may want to have more than 8 oz.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/14tinaf
50,Internal trail of Catalina Island,"This is worth a go if you want to look around the island and see what else Catalina holds. See wild buffalo roaming the hills and plenty of wild birds including the Bald eagle spotted around the island. The jeep tour is comfortable, but I would recommend that you cover up as you will be covered in dust if you decide to do this tour in the summer dry months. I don't recall water being provided but we all had taken a bottle ourselves which was needed.The tour takes to you some interesting places including the Airport in the Sky, a world war 2 disused bunker, a disused old coach house and an excellent island view point which is great for photos.the tour car could only take 4 comfortably, so we had 2 cars for the 8 of us. Along the way you will see cyclists doing the trail & hikers.Took us about 2.5 - 3 hours to do the full tour, which we thoroughly enjoyed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parveenh2019
40,"Mostly good, bits great, and other bits less so","First of all, the Conservancy's new Trailhead building is beautifully constructed - the quality is evident throughout, and this on an island where almost nothing except Catalina Island Company properties are well built. The gift shop is expansive and interesting; something for everyone with a handful of generally cool and clever bits.However, the restaurant upstairs hasn't quite figured out what it wants to be. A bar? A trendy restaurant? A casual joint? As of now, you order at the bar from a chalkboard menu and await service. A few more menu items in place of all those beers would be nice too. And the deck seating is a puzzle. Why would you build it such that your view is blocked when you're sitting down? I dunno ... but still worth a try and the bugs will undoubtedly work themselves out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Poochkin
50,Toyon Grill,"Above the Trailhead is the recently opened Toyon Grill. Housed in the Trailhead's new contemporary structure, it's a great place to relax with some good eats and worthy coffee on the rooftop patio overlooking the Avalon bay. Friendly and pleasant service add to the experience. The BBQ bison and pulled pork sandwich was delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KrohnAir
10,Don't Waste Your Money,"I booked the 3-hour tour for 4 adults assuming that it would be private. When we arrived there were two other passengers. After looking at the jeep configuration I went into the office to rebook our tour & I was told nothing was available. I asked for my money back and of course the lady in charge was curt and said it was passed 6 hours. I told her my concern, but I was the ""hog at the hog roast"". After much discussion I went outside to meet our out-of-town guest and since I was the smallest...I got the middle back seat that has a 1"" piece of foam under upholstery I set in a 2"" HOLE!! for two hours. My back was in pain so the other guest changed seats with me for a short time; then one of our guest took the seat for the next 1/2 hr. The Jeep is a 5 passenger not a six!!! The guide had little to work with...very few animals (1 Bison, 1 Fox), but the scenery was beautiful, but not for 3 hours. (This experience reminded me if you are booked in the last seat on an airplane with two large people on both sides.) My recommendation is that you rent a golf cart and enjoy the view on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peaches0072015
10,Good Tour Guide. Unfair Seating,"We had a bad experience. We thought we would have a Jeep to ourselves, but the tour company added two more people. The problem is that these modified Jeeps can hold six in adequate comfort, but the seventh must sit on a padded surface made to look like a seat. For a very small child (under seven) it might work. But to cram an adult into that space is unfair. It is nearly impossible to see the surroundings from that position, and the two guests on either side are very crowded. Get your seating guaranteed before you sign on to this company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y1549HOedh
20,Vehicles Cannot Seat 6 Adults,"I spent two of the three hours on the tour seated in the mid seat of the rear row of. seats. Unlike the other seats there was no headrest. In fact, there really wasn't a seat at all, merely a lightly padded bar that I sat on. My buttocks were on seat fabric suspended over nothing. Unsafe and uncomfortable, as others were 'too large' to sit back there. When we complained, the Conservancy refused to refund our fares saying it was too late.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grognard
50,Excellent tour - very worthwhile!,"This was an excellent tour that revealed the interesting history and natural beauty of Catalina Island beyond the honky-tonk atmosphere you encounter when you get off the ferry. The Island Conservancy has done an excellent job of preserving the island and its wildlife and it is well-worth seeing. If you haven't done this tour, you haven't seen Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EBGboston
40,3 hour eco tour is fun but expensive,We did the 3 hour eco tour on a jeep. The guide was very informative and it was good to see the key sights on the eastern half of the island. But at $119 per person it was rather expensive and I think the 2 hour tour would be enough (or some other tour).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beebaly
50,The place to learn about the interior of the Island.,"Visit the new Trailhead headguarters. Check in for hikes, mountain biking, jeep tours. There is so much to learn about the island and this is the place to get informed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnAir474199
50,Most of Catalina is managed by the conservancy,Santa Catalina island is very special as the conservancy manages all most aa of the island. This is great in my opinion it keeps Catalina natural. The town itself Avalon is only allowed to be 3 square miles and it’s about there. That means the test of the island is home to many indemic species as well as many introduced like the Buffalo that the conservancy controls the size of The heard. The Catalina Fox is the cutest ever and either ona tour or when hiking you may catch a glimpse. There is a trail one can do and camp that could take several days. It was so clear when we were there you could see snow capped mountains on the mainland as well as the buildings in Long Beach. Pretty spectacular & unusual as I understand it. The people of Catalina Island should be very proud of the conservancy and from an outsider looking in it seems they are doing an outstanding job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/197mischellel
40,Worth 30-45 minutes to understand the history and flora and fauna of the Island,"We were passing by and decided to stop, The volunteer inside seemed a bit lonely. Not sure how much traffic during the week. She was extremely knowledgeable and interesting to speak with. There are a few short videos and nice exhibits with information on the Catalina Fox, Bald Eagles and the natives. We learned a good amount and it is not overwhelming. Good for kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11douglast
50,gorgeous,We rented a golf cart and made our way to this beautiful site. So much to look at. All plants were well marked. Totally worth the price of admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lunarooney
40,Fantastic Interior Tour,"Our family took a 3 1/2 hour interior, Jeep tour with Beth. We saw foxes, bison, deer, hawks, and much more. Despite the high cost of the tour, we recommended the door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/openville
50,Must see if you visit Catalina,Don't miss this. You can take a shuttle up to the airport for $16/person. We wanted to hike the 10-13 miles back down to our hotel but didn't have enough daylight left so we hiked 2-3 miles around the airport and took the shuttle back down. It's scary on the way up as you feel you are about to go over a cliff. The way down is better because you are on the inside of the roadway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieg793
50,The rangers there were very helpful as was all Conservancy staff we interacted with,We felt a bit taken back by the $65 fee we had to pay to ride a bike on the conservancy lands but later found that it did support a wonderful piece of land for future visitors to enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdando
50,3hr jeep eco tour,It was worth it. Do it. Great way to see the landscape and seascape and learn some history. Dress in layers as it can get breezy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryannC8154LJ
50,3-Hour Tour,"This jeep tour into the interior of Catalina Island is a must for every visitor. It is the only way to appreciate the fact that 88 percent of the island has been preserved in it's natural state, free of condos and fudge shops.The views are breathtaking and we were lucky enough to run across bison several times during our three hour ride through the backcountry.Our guide was knowledgeable and personable, offering context on the history and ecology of the island.If you have to chose -- skip the zip line and putt-putt golf and take this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clintw373
50,Museum,Small but extremely interesting. All about the wild life on Catalina and land. Worth taking the time to go to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helen1tex
50,Great Jeep tour!,One of the best Jeep tours ever! The tour guide Joy was awesome and very knowledgeable of the island and area. We learned more than we ever thought about the Bison on the island. She knew a lot about the plant life and overall history.Very worth the time spent and highly recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slick12
40,Intimate and Interesting,"This is the second time I've taken a tour around the interior of Catalina. Six or seven years ago I took one on a 1950s school bus that was driven and narrated by this hyper-intelligent, hilarious, fearless Hawaiian woman. (Some of the treacherous roads she drove with that old bus were worth the price of admission alone!) Compared to that tour, this Conservancy one has the advantage of guests asking questions throughout the journey since the jeep is so small. The downside is that I saw more of the island on the old bus tour - and honestly learned more from that tour guide. Our Conservancy tour guide was very knowledgeable, friendly, and engaging, but often needed to be prodded for more historical and scientific information. We were lucky to see a buffalo up close and a fox or two. Both tours take you to the airport to buy cookies. I didn't understand that the first time nor the second time: they're just cookies made from standard frozen cookie dough! There are more interesting places on the island to tour, like the eagle sanctuary. We did a 2-hour tour, so perhaps the 3-hour tour gets you out there. I do love what the Conservancy does to protect the landscape and animals of the island, however, so I would gladly support this outfit over the others now that the bus tour is no more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathanwM9225SM
50,"Great, informative tour","This organization has a huge responsibility, and the tour we received over the island was worth every penny. For a place that's hard to cover if you're not a backpacker or a sailor, the Conservancy tour was perfect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EcoArtTraveler
50,Beautiful Views and Impressive Wildlife,"We did the 3-hour Jeep Eco Tour with the Catalina Island Conservancy, and it's one of the best tours we've ever taken. Joy was a fun, enthusiastic guide whose name fit her perfectly. Going with the Conservancy takes you all over the island and on some back roads that no one else has access to; the Jeeps they use are very comfortable. We saw over twenty bison - some almost close enough to touch, a bald eagle's nest, a heron, some injured eagles that were being rehabilitated, and a tiny island fox. Also saw amazing views, World War II bunkers, a winery under development, and beautiful beaches. The tour also stops at the Airport in the Sky where you can buy one of their famous cookies. At one point Joy said, ""It's really time to turn back, but I'm having so much fun - would you guys like to stay out a little longer?"" Everyone in our group enthusiastically agreed. Along the way we learned about the Wrigley family and the history of the island. If you enjoy nature, wildlife, history, and beautiful views, I can't recommend this tour highly enough. You never know what you'll see around the next corner. We'd take the Jeep Eco Tour again in a heartbeat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanogirl
50,3 Hour Eco-Tour,"The only way to get a view of the island interior. Great views, bison, fox, bald eagles, reservoirs, and a winery under construction in the back country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelesP897FM
50,Beautiful Island,It was so much fun driving through the island on the jeep. Our guide was great!! Very informative. We didn't see many animals but it was still really beautiful. The views from the top of the mountains was just lovely.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnR344
30,Great Guide,My son and I did the Eco Jeep Tour with another couple and our guide was enthusiastic about the Island and had a wealth of knowledge. She tried her hardest to find some wildlife to share with us but none was to be found. I was disappointed not to have seen a Bison or maybe an eagle but the closest we came to seeing any type of animal was at the Airport in the sky we saw a small fox. I've actually been on many Eco Tours in the US and on a Few Islands and this is the first time we saw nothing. I realize it wasn't her fault but it was disappointing none the less.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satellitesue1
50,More than tours,"In addition to the tours that Catalina Is. Conservancy operate, they have a nature center near the Wrigley Memorial & Botanic Garden and on the bus route. This small 1-room center has a gift area with books and souvenirs as well as panel displays on the wildlife and botany of Catalina Island. The staff member answers questions about the island. The best part for me is birding from their patio; this time I watched a red-headed sapsucker and a daytime moon. Also, in Avalon city center the conservancy has a stately house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
10,Trip was cancelled just 2 hours before start time,Most likely it is best tour in Catalina but it is not very reliable. Our tour was cancelled when we already were on Catalina express because their drive got sick. It almost ruined our plan how we wanted to explore Catalina,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vitaliy94080
50,great tour!,"Our driver, Maria was very personable and knowledgeable of the area. Provided a large amount of history of the island transitioning from the Wrigley family to it's current status/ownership. .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w435play
50,3-hour tour is the way to go,"My husband and I took this tour on our trip to Catalina. So many people told us: ""You can see the island in 2-3 hours and then there's nothing to do there."" These are people who kept to Avalon and didn't do any exploring; how sad for them! We wanted to see the ""real"" Catalina and this tour is the way to do it. Our guide, Maria, has lived on the island for 6 years and used to work with the bald eagle restoration effort there. She had amazing insight into all the nooks and crannies on the island and was invaluable to the tour. We debated between the 2-hour and 3-hour tour. We are so glad we decided on the 3-hour tour. The 2-hour would only get to you to the airport and back. With the 3-hour tour, you get to see additional coves and amazing views of Little Harbor and Shark Harbor which the Whale's Tail splits - gorgeous! This tour made us want to go back to Catalina and explore more of the island by hiking and camping. We are already thinking of our next trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishkaken
50,Best Catalina Island tour!,We took a two hour jeep Eco tour. We chose this company based on the reviews and for the support. We are very glad we did it! The guide was extremely knowledgeable and she answered all our questions! We saw the places that we didn't even think existed on the island. The views were just magnificent! The only regret was that we did not take a three hour tour. The time flew by really fast. Don't forget the sweater as it gets chilly in the hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edki
40,Only way to see the backside of Catalina,"Mountain biking this terrain is probably expert level. Hiking is pretty darn tough as well (lots of peaks and valleys) and looks like it can take all day. Good access is only by tour group. Our guide had a report that the bison herd was around middle camp, so she made a departure from her usual route to the airport and back. We wound up seeing about a third of the herd! Been to Yellowstone, but never this close before... Seeing the eagle (bald and golden) up close was pretty cool too. Hubby said he saw a Catalina Island Fox, and we all saw a red-tailed hawk circling overhead. So, that covered alot of the wildlife! Maybe the 3-hr tour next time, as we did the 2-hr. I would have likd to have seen the backside beaches up close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/capposcasa
50,"Really awesome, very informative!!","We LOVED this tour. We went on the three hour ride and our tour guide Beth made it such a fun experience. The tour started as soon as we left the conservancy, with Beth pointing out different sights and facts around Avalon. She was full of knowledge about the animals, history, and plant life of the island and was very welcoming with questions. It was such a great time, the three hours FLEW by! We saw buffalo, foxes, and birds of all types. I can’t recommend this tour enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessAlyce
50,Great Tour,We signed up for the long inland tour. We thought it might be too long. We were wrong the tour was awesome and went by quickly. Our guide Charlie was very informative and was able to answer any and all question we asked in reference to Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d_darr
50,Jeep Eco Tour - great way to see the island!,"Last summer, my husband and I spent 4 days hiking / backpacking / camping on the island (via the Trans-Catalina Trail, booked through Catalina Island Conservancy). So when it was time to visit the island again, this time with my elderly parents, we decided to go with the Jeep Eco Tour. A great way to see the interior of the island if you only have a several hours to spare. Our guide was fantastic! We learned about the history of the island and saw plenty of wildlife. Highly recommend the 3 hour tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angryporcupine
50,Jeep Eco Tour - totally worth it,"great tour, be sure to ask for a guide that is comfortable traveling up the more sketchy paths. If you want to go but your guide isn't comfortable you're out of luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmK9447PM
50,Great hiking and tours; they own most of the Island,"The Wrigley family donated their ownership of the island lands to the Conservancy to protect it from development. Now there are trails through out the island, campgrounds and, for non-hikers, Eco-tours by jeep for 2, 3 or 4 hours. The most common hike from town: take the bus to the Botanical Garden, pay the entrance fee, hike through lots of interesting cacti and desert plants. The trail starts to the right of the Memorial. It’s worth the climb up the Wrigley Memorial to see learn about the tile factory on Catalina and the blue flagstone quarried on the island. It’s a 1.2 mile fire road up to the ridge, where you can see the ocean on the other side of the island. Then 0.8 more gradual climb along the Cross Catalina trail to a shaded tree spot, and then down a bit steeper and narrower trail (than the fire road) to the Hermit Gulch campground. Bring lots of water. There is not much shade on a sunny day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leem813
50,Can't Miss!,"Best thing to do on the island! We saw buffalo, Catalina fox, ground squirrels and eagles. Guides are very knowledgeable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freije1
50,We saw a fox!,I loved my conservancy tour. I have been coming to Catalina since I was a kid but I have never really spent time on the interior. Being able to learn about the ecology and history of the island while on an adventure was great. We saw an island fox and a bison!Be sure to layer for the tour! The jeep had blankets but it was still freezing when speeding up and down hills.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galinadubes
50,Informative,We stopped on our way up to the botanical gardens learned a little bit about the fox and the Bison and met a really nice worker named Sean. Learned about feral cat problem. Good learning experience for the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolccCNA
50,Best experience,Bison (Buffalo) are my spirit animal✨ We were so close to these divine sacred animals. So much confirmation on so many levels. Everything aligned perfectly we got our own personal tour around the whole island. Our tour guide Joy had the best energy and such a beautiful soul. She did everything to make us comfortable as possible! She truly made this experience whole! Being in the bisons element was so captivating. Seeing all the wild life was so magical! Feel so blessed and grateful to have such a spiritually humbling experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthasteele08
50,great tour,"the 2 hour tour was amazing, we even got to see 2 herds of buffalo, they were so amazing! Also our tour guide Laura was very informative and told us a lot of very interesting things about the island",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400trishac
50,If you do nothing else while on Santa Catalina,The opportunity to visit the “rest” of the island is one not to be missed. The unspoiled beauty of the land is indescribable and likely as California was before the great migration westward. The Conservancy runs a variety of tours out onto the property with experienced naturalists of varying lengths for visitors to the island. They are well worth the time and cost. Go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Greatislan
50,Free Naturalist I Training!,"It ran for 2 hours. I wasn't sure what to expect initially. Hilary, our resident expert, did not disappoint. It's given in a classroom like setting at the nature center with graphic slides and artifacts. We learned about the island geography, plants and animals indigenous to Catalina. What made it really interesting is Hilary's passion. I felt really engaged and wanting to know more. Also, you get a certificate of completion. In July there is part 2 which I believe takes you out in the field.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alashea

50,"World-renowned, and for good reason","Were it not for the initial generosity of the Wrigley family and the tireless efforts of the Catalina Island Conservancy ever since, this ecologically delicate, often water-starved island might now be overrun with luxury vacation developments and desalination plants. The Conservancy office is a great place to pick up educational materials and learn about exciting ways to see the island's remote interior and wildlife. Learn about the nearly miraculous recovery of the adorable and ever-resourceful Catalina Island Fox, for example, or the successful, highly beneficial post-DDT-era reintroduction of bald eagles to the island ecosystem.These conservation stories are world-renowned, and for good reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamm690
50,GREAT way to see the island!,Our family really enjoyed the 3 1/2 hour jeep tour of the island. The tour guide was wonderful and shared a lot of knowledge about the island and its history and culture. He answered a lot of questions and was very helpful. What a fantastic way to experience this beautiful island! GREAT family activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39tessf
50,TERRIFIC Jeep Tour,The Catalina Island Conservancy is a great Hidden Gem! We took the 2hr jeep tour with Ernie as our Tour Guide. Discovered that we had a family connection Ernie. What a fun small world memory that was. Ernie provided great information about the history of Catalina Island. We saw a bison herd and got to stop at the Airport in the Sky. This is a must do activity that the entire family will enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzie623
50,Jeep trip,We received a summary of a Jeep trip inland on Catalina Island. Sounded interesting so I signed up my traveling companions and myself for this two hour trip. We all were very pleased with the trip. We learned a lot about the history of the island. I’ve visited there a few times and had never been inland. We drove over paved and dirt roads. We saw an Island Fox who some thought had been paid to walk in front of our vehicle and smile. The bison was quite a ways aways from the road but it was still fun to see the huge guy. It is always strange to see a desert island in the middle of the ocean. The driver/guide was very pleasant and knowledgeable. He made our trip!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciaa486
50,Open-Air Tour!,"Took the 3-hour tour and well worth it! Beth, the tour guide was so informative. Definitely glad I took the 3-hour tour to see the island. The views at times (way up high) were breath-taking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deljay
50,Great job!,"We did the Catalina Island Conservancy jeep tour, visited the Nature Center and botanic garden, Wrigley Monument. These folks are great stewards of the island's natural areas.

50,Indiana Jones revisited,"Biofuel diesel off-road vehicles are used to take one into the interior, and to the west or ""back"" side of the island. Rugged terrain and rough roads make it as much fun as an Indiana Jones adventure. There are several tours; The East End and Cape Canyon tours are especially recommended - we saw bison, many birds, lots of small game and miles of attractive beach and ridge lines. On top of that, your money goes to preserving 88% of Santa Catalina Island as open and mostly pristine couontry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsacerdo
50,A perfect way to see the island,"We wanted to get a true sense of the island on our first trip there, so scheduled a tour with the Conservancy. It was wonderful.Our guide was great, we were comfortable, and a 2-hour tour was almost too short to see all we discovered was on the island. Amazing that the island is so hilly and steep in spots...if you are tentative on heights or have motion sickness, you might consider a Dramamine before you depart. Can't think of a better way to introduce yourselves to Catalina, and the Conservancy does it right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IDFNP
50,Worthwhile visiting for advice,My wife and I wanted to do an 8-mile hike and went to the conservancy for advice and to obtain the (free) hiking permits.The staff were very helpful in assisting us to plan the hike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjh672016
50,Great way to see the island,"We recently took the 3-hour jeep tour with the Conservancy. It was both fun and educational. Our guide, Scott, really knew the history of Catalina and was friendly and happy to answer questions. We took the tour right when we arrived on the island, and it gave us a good overview, making our the rest of our time more interesting. I highly recommend the longer tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ross4860
50,WOW - the views!,We took a tour (hummer) from the Catalina Island Tour company and it goes into the conservancy. The guide was knowledgeable and interesting. We found a pack of bison and got up very close to them. We stopped along the way at a beach and the airport. Saw the bald and golden eagles. Drove through middle ranch. it was a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/185barbp
50,Amazing Views and Guide,Our guide/driver Pat was amazing. He was very friendly and concerned with us having a great time. He took us to see bison and eagles and talked about the history of the island. The views were beautiful. The weather in Avalon was mellow but it was colder back in the hills. Take an extra jacket or two to keep warm. They do provide blankets and water. We had the best time and would certainly do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeleneM100
50,New View of Catalina Island,This is a fantastic trip. We did the 3 hour jeep tour. It is a great way to see the island. The tour guide was knowledgeable about the island and the events that have happened in years pass. The jeep was comfortable- It is a great way to see the island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61janinem
50,best way to see the interior,"There are a number of jeep and van excursions available to see the interior of the island. If you want to do a short option with a lot of scenic views, take the van to the airport in the sky, and hike the loop trail, then can come back on a later van. You can get hiking permits online in advance or on the same day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestwoodTrekker
50,2 hr Jeep Eco Tour,"Four of us went with Beth as our guide/driver. She's fantastic - so knowledgeable, entertaining and informative. She asked us what we particularly hoped to see (bison and foxes) and sure enough took us to a spot where we could watch about 40 bison - as she told us - making their daily decision about whether to spend the night there or move on. It was fascinating. Later we saw one of Catalina's foxes run up the bank and we stopped to watch it, while it watched us. The scenery on all sides was beautiful. The weather was clear and sunny, if cold, but Beth had fleece blankets for all of us so we stayed snug. It was a great experience - highly recommended. We learned lots of history of the island, the native plants, animals and birds and how the Conservancy works to protect them all - simply brilliant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tartangirl51
50,2 Hour Jeep Tour,"Unbelievealbe!. The tour guide was so knowledgable. Fantastic history of the island and animals. Views to die for. A must go if you are at Catalina. Take into account the temperature, it get windy in the open air jeep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9351VVjohnn

50,Jeep Eco Tour of the Interior,"Left our cruise ship for this tour of the Catalina Interior. 3 of us joined another couple and our guide at the downtown location. We quickly got into rugged terrain and untouched nature. Abundant plant and wildlife call Catalina home, and it is magnificent to see. I personally wasn't looking forward to a 2-hour Jeep ride, but what a marvel this place is.Our guide was knowledgeable of the family histories, the plants and origins, and the wildlife which populate the island. The views are breathtaking, rugged, simple and mostly untouched except by the critters. Her stories of all these things kept my attention the entire time, and alas, I was sorry it had to end. See this rugged place from the comfort of a Jeep, cover a lot of ground, and still be able to get close to the action.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2118MYjackp
50,Something different,"If you like going off the beaten tourist path and learn about an area, this is for you! Beautiful, informative. Wear warm clothing! It can be very cold, windy and rainy up there. Dress in layers, but the guide has blankets stowed too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pdxfirefish2017
50,Take This Tour of the Catalina Outback!,"We took the conservancy tour since the fee goes to help preserve the island ecology. You can see bison, foxes, deer and our guide gave us a very thorough explanation of the plants and wildlife on the island. The tour is 2, 3 or 4 hours. We took the 2 hour one for $70. Wear warm clothing as the jeep has no closed windows!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reparatamazzola
50,Jeep Eco Tour,Fantastic tour with Ron on the 3 hour Jeep Eco Tour. I have done the Catalina Island one a few years ago and this is far superior. Ron is a local with a lot of knowledge and he graciously answered all our questions (three of us had a lot of questions!). You get to see places on this tour that other tour companies don't go to including seeing a bald eagle and a golden eagle. Great way to support the conservancy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PSpencerCSmith
50,Great trip breath taking views,"Myself and my husband decided to take a tour on my birthday as we love nature and exploring new places.The tour guide was very knowledgeable and helpful. We took a two hour tour which gave us a great trip around the back of the island. We got to see bison and many birds, sadly all the foxes and eagles were hiding. But it was still worth it to see the unparalleled untouched landscapes of Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V812PCcarolinem
50,Did my research ahead of time- was worth it!!!,"Did the research of all the Jeep/ island tours etc. Picked the CIC bc of what they stand for and non profit status. And so glad we did!! Pat was our driver. He was safe, funny, and very informative. He put up with all our questions. The weather was perfect. We saw bison, squirrels, and eagles. The only complaint we would have is the seatbelt would lock up and Pat had to feed it through very slowly every time we got out to look at something.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnmarieKKeiramnnA
40,Stop by to register if you are doing any hikes,"We did not take any of their tours but stopped by to gather information and maps of the island and decided to take the Garden-to-Sky trail instead of the much longer Hermit Gulch Trail and registered for the hike. Very knowledgeable and friendly, and even received a free DVD with pictures of the island once they saw my ""birthday button""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
50,Take a jeep tour!,"Wonderful visit. We had a private tour with the 6 of us & an excellent guide. We laughed & learned about the island the whole way. We had a blind woman with us & our guide made it a point to tell her about many things the rest of us saw. We stopped at the airport in the sky, the nature center and a horse ranch. This is a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendyo854
50,Fun jeep ride,"We took the 3 hour jeep ride which was fun. We got to see a lot of buffalo and one deer. There are 7 in the jeep including the driver and it is open for a full view of everything. You see all the vegetation, the desert part of the island as well as the airport and the other harbor. Next time we plan to take the full day tour. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7709PNdennisc
50,Visitor must see,I had walked by many times but had never stopped. Lots of good info and the gal at the information desk was full of knowledge and absolutely adorable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RIDERresidential
50,Highlight of Our Trip,"Paula, our food tour guide, recommended the conservancy for an inland jeep tour, and she told us to ask for Ernie. What a great recommendation. We took the three-hour tour (which we would highly recommend taking the three hour instead of two), as there is a lot to see and a lot of ground to cover. Ernie was GREAT! We saw bison, fox, a seal, a bald eagle, numerous other birds, and AMAZING coastal views. It truly was one of the best experiences we have had on Catalina!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gotf8th
50,Trans Catalina Trail camping,"My friend and I had trouble booking campsites online for the Trans Catalina trail. We called and Micah was the biggest help! She was knowledgeable on where to stay (we chose Blackjack night one, Little Harbor night two, and Parson night 3) and she provided us with detailed instructions on ferry times and gave great suggestion on places to explore. Really pleased with the service and we're looking forward to our adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleydH1043CD
50,Jeep ride of a lifetime!,"Took the 3 hour eco jeep tour. Highly recommend anyone visiting the island do this. Informative driver will tell you all about the island (past and present), and the views are spectacular! Two stops- one at the Airport in the Sky (wow), and one to to see the eagles in captivity that are injured and cannot fly or be on their own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7012XZdeborahm
50,Bison Bison Bison,The best 2 hours. We spotted 5 Bison. Ron our driver was very informative and the head set made it easy to hear even in the open jeep. So happy to help support the Conservancy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bruinfan3
50,HIghly recommended,"Beth was our tour guide for a 2-hour tour. She was very knowledgeable and personable. 2 of us, including me, had a fear of heights. She made us feel safe even with winding mountain roads. She taught us about the history of the island, it's geography and wildlife. We saw beautiful vistas, bisons, and the Airport in the Sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaviewKing15
50,Great Jeep tour of the Island,"We learned of this tour from a brochure at the Catalina Express Station. While waiting to board the boat for the island, we chatted with Michelle at the Catalina Island Company desk and she helped us choose a tour that met our needs (short, not too blazingly hot, and a time slot that was available). We were on a morning tour on 6/30/17.Our tour guide was Beth. The ride was comfortable and Beth provided great information on the flora and fauna of the island as she took us up and into the Conservancy area of the island. We saw a herd of Bison but just missed a fox. The tiny airport where we stopped for a bathroom break before turning around to head back down to Avalon was very interesting, as well. It was a great way to kick off our first morning on Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332Gail
50,Three Hour Tour,"Ron,our guide, was very knowledgeable and gave us a great tour. We rode up to the airport for a break. We saw beautiful coves and beaches.We saw a couple of foxes, two Bison, and two Eagles. We saw the real and wild Catalina! Loved it! We had a great time and met great people. The jeep holds six, however, a smaller person needs to sit in the middle of the last row. Very educational! Best thing we did on the island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylS0
50,Jeep Eco Tour- Amazing!,"We actually stumbled into the Catalina Island Conservancy to get our hiking passes (free). I would actually recommend that you do that online, but the Conservancy was nice enough to point us in the right direction. We decided to do the Jeep Eco Tour with Ron for three hours and it was totally worth it. We went up and inland where we were able to see the bison in the natural habitat. Ron even drove us on part of the trans-Catalina trail which was amazing. Ron was also super knowledgeable and had answers to even some of our obscure questions. I would highly recommend it!Logistics: Small group tour. (Max: 5 people per jeep). They accept credit card for payment. Tip in cash (not mandatory but appreciated).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianesjavier
50,The best!!,"The entire family agrees- this was the best thing we did while visiting Catalina for 4 days! We are a family of 5 (3 teens) and we took a 3 hour Jeep eco tour with Scott. What a great tour guide! Scott knows it all- he answered every question we had and filled us in on so much abut the island. We loved hearing his story and his history (and his family's history) on the island. He really is a great tour guide. We learned about the history of the island and the Conservancy and the Wrigley Family. Scott is such a great tour guide that he made the history part of the tour interesting for the teens. We saw so many bison and we loved the story of how the bison came to the island.... and how some left too. We saw the beautiful beaches on the west coast of the island, the Rusack vineyards, the airport in the sky (and the Killer Cookies!!). There's so much more to this island than just Avalon! I love that the Conservancy owns most of the island and will protect it's natural beauty. What a sight it was.... undeveloped Pacific beachfront property with views for days.... Take this tour. You will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cljd
50,We did the Jeep Eco Tour,"Recommend Eco tour if you are into history of native animals, and plants on Catalina Island. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable, and friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaV63
50,Back Coutry Jeep Tour,"Took the 2 hour Jeep ECO Tour, our driver's name was Chuck, he was a great guide. Girlfriend and I went on the tour Sunday morning, jeep was comfortable, seating in the middle row of seats, couldn't see out front very well, as the canopy and top of the windshield blocked the view, but was still able to see everything out the side. Saw several buffalo, but no fox's or eagles. Chuck was very friendly, great attitude and was very knowledgeable about the island. I would like to go again, this time taking a longer tour.Tip: The very rear seats feel the bumps more, and gets more wind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7888LZpaulw
50,Best of Catalina,"Best thing we did on Catalina was the Eco Jeep tour, 3 hours and we saw and heard about everything. Beth the naturalist was as good as they get and I have traveled the world",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dallasmhw
50,Best way to see Catalina,"We took a three hour keep tour with Scott and really enjoyed it. Like others we saw Bison, fox and the eagles in the rehab center. It was great to go into the island and get away from the Avalon crowds. This tour (as well as a boat trip over to Two Harbors for the day) made my trip to Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmills1164
50,Safari tour one of the best,"We loved the safari tour on Catalina. Our driver narrated while driving us from Avalon up to the airport, and back. He stopped many times to view wild life, and scenic stops, we saw buffalo and he told us the history of how they came to be there. Love that our fees support the conservancy. Roads were narrow and winding but our driver took great care to make us feel safe and make our trip enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonitadc
50,A Must See,"We took the two hour Jeep tour. It was fantastic. Ernie, our tour guide, gave us interesting information about the island, its history, the conservation efforts on the island, and took us to some amazing spots. The views along the trail are amazing. We were fortunate to see dozens of bison. A herd had decided to lay in the middle of the trail so we were no more than 10 feet away for about 15 minutes. We stopped at the bald eagle rehabilitation facility and got to see the eagles at feeding time.This tour made the trip for us. It was money well spent, and at the price they charge, an excellent value. This tour is a must for anybody who wants to see more than shops and restaurants on their visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefflT4227CG
40,"Liked it so much, we took the tour a 2nd time!","Other reviews tell it all, so I won't go into all we saw, although we did get to see 2 or 3 bison up close, like 10 feet away. It is a great way to really appreciate Catalina Island and escape the touristy vibe.But if you take this tour, I suggest you make sure there are no more than 5 adults in the jeep. We had 6 full-size adults, and that rear seat is not designed to hold 3 of them! Very squished, the person in center had limited view, and the center seatbelt cut painfully into the passenger's shoulder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rinna
50,Jeep Eco tour definitely worth it!,"Wanted to see more of the island than just Avalon so took the 2 hour Jeep tour. Got a nice blend of island history, fantastic views, up close encounter with the bison, and a sense of what is happening on the island now, ecologically speaking. A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours and you don't feel quite as much like an Avalon tourist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/140foodie
50,Fantastic tour with great scenery,We really enjoyed this tour -- Jeep was full and guide was super and knew a ton about the island -- we say lots of Buffalo and visited nature center and saw lots of beauty -- great trip and would do the same tour over and over,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hibby922
50,Jeep tour!,We took the 3 hour tour. Fantastic! Rex our tour guide was awesome. Provided island history and great scenery. This is a must do on the island as with the Jeep it can go places where larger vehicle s can not go. Got up close to some bison..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toniat701
50,Great Service that they do!,Meeting place for their ECO Jeep Tour. Really a nice trip and a great place to visit. They made our whole day and a whole lot better than spending money on things that you really don't need. Getting out in nature so so much better for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebusinessforms
50,Take the Jeep Eco Tour!,"We visited the island for the first time and chose the Eco Tour as a way to explore. The vehicle was very comfortable and our tour guide Beth was fantastic! I would recommend this tour to anyone of any age, with young children too! Mine are 26 and 30, and they too need to be entertained! Beth kept us laughing and we learned so much. Saw a bison too! This tour stops at the airport where you can shop and grab some snacks. The cookies were the best deal on the island! Make this a MUST DO on your trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87pamelah
10,Hostile environment,"Expect to pay - even if you are riding for a short time!!I wanted to go on a mountain bike ride for 2 hours, the conservancy will only sell you a permit for a year - for 35$. Not much help if you're there for an afternoon. So I asked if I could ride on the paved road to the airport and they said yes. NOT so said the ranger who forced me off the road and made me turn around - all with a terrible, unwelcoming attitude. I'm sure the paved road is a legal easement but they will bully you and threaten to call the police. They won't let you buy a pass from the ranger. Such an unpleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnketch
50,Gem of the Island,Seeing this area via jeep tour was amazing. So nice to see the area being kept in its natural beauty. Saw so much wildlife and stunning views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdollkk
50,Take the 3hr Jeep tour!,"Fantastic afternoon trip into interior. Small groups (6 including the driver) and we saw a fox, Bison and Eagle. The Eagle was in captivity due to being unable to fly. Very knowledgeable driver and provided an excellent history of the area as we drove. Stopped at the Airport in the sky for restroom break and cookies. A fog was hanging over the island near the airport and then cleared up as we headed further inland. Beautiful coastal views! I would do this tour again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulieG4735
50,The inland Jeep tour with the conservancy,We took the 2 hour inland Jeep tour with the conservancy (there are a few choices) and found it to be a great trip. I have been going to the island my entire life and a local was able to tell me information I didn't know and was able to share old memories as well when I asked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270Pat_C
50,Take the Island Tour,We had a fantastic 3 hour afternoon island tour. The jeep was able to accomodate 7 of us. The driver was very knowledgable and told us a great deal about the history of the island and the ongoing effort to protect the indigenous flora and fauna. We got to the airport in the sky which was cool and up close to the bison that were introduced by a film crew back in the 20s. I would definitely take another tour with these folks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greggwhizz
50,Excellent tour of the interior,"We took the 3 hour eco-tour through the undeveloped areas of the island. We met at the conservancy office, and our group had only 6 people! It was pretty much a private tour, and we covered a lot of ground. After climbing to a viewpoint of the town, we continued into the conservation area. We got to see a big herd of bison up close! We stopped briefly at the airport; make sure you get a big cookie from the cafe. They are so chewy and delicious. I wish we'd had more time at the airport to look at the exhibits, as they have a nature center there, and there are even trails you can hike to see artifacts from the native people who originally lived on the island. We then made our way around to the west coast, with its beautiful wild coastline. We stopped at their eagle rehabilitation area to view their eagles. Then we headed back to the town. Our guide was knowledgeable and friendly, and gave excellent commentary throughout the trip. We saw bison, a snake, a fox, a ground squirrel, and many birds, and of course the beautiful scenery. The tour is reasonably priced and the funds go toward continuing conservation efforts. We'd recommend it highly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/molokaigirl808
50,Jeep trip to the center of the Island,Wonderful 2 hour open jeep trip. Our guide worked for the Conservancy and had a great deal of knowledge of the island. Frequent stops to enjoy the view. Chose to see the bald eagles and it was a great stop on the tour. Also saw a bison. Great fun. Our guide had great sense of humor and we enjoyed every moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBeesonRN
50,Jeep Tour -- IT ROCKS!,I did the three-hour jeep tour. It significantly exceeded my expectations. It was a true 4-wheel drive needed tour. The drivers have the ability to customize as they go. Ernie was a wonderful tour guide and driver. The Conservancy's knowledge of the island and the small size of the tour (6 people maximum) make this tour extraordinary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimmmiemaz
50,Jeep Tour,"We did the 2 hour Jeep tour and we were so happy with the experience. Beth was our driver and she was very knowledgeable about the flora and fauna on the island. The other family on the tour had been on a Jeep tour before, so she tailored the route to include areas that they had not seen. We saw bison, eagles and fox on the tour. We also learned about the Conservancy's extensive work to preserve the wildlife on the island. We were very impressed by their efforts. Would highly recommend doing the tour through the Conservancy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GraceM100
40,Day trip,Catalina Island's nice place to visit a lot of interesting things to do there you can drive you can see the Garibaldi which is the state fish of California you can see Eagles and Osprey and see buffalo on the island wild goats you can parasail you can go on an underwater tour in the submarine which is Park submarine doesn't go all the way under water sail boat ride boat ride whatever you feel like doing just vegging out walking around soaking up the culture it's a nice place,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/darrellstravel
50,The Ocean is Clear and Camping is Great,"Had a wonderful time visiting Avalon and camping at Two Harbors. I enjoyed the boat ride to the island from Long Beach, as it was only 1 hour long. You can get there in 15 minutes by Helicopter too! I really liked the peace and beauty that the island offers, and it is very simple place. Conserved so nicely, and very relaxing at your own campsite steps from the beach. I recommend this place to everyone I meet, and you as well. Go Explore Catalina and Take a Friend on their Birthday. Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottTours
50,Helpful,The conservancy offered valuable advice on Hiking Trips around Avalon; the Hermit Gulch Trail was of moderate difficulty and offered fabulous views of the valley and the marina. Excellent staff !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nuni14
50,Very personal and informative tour,"We did the two hour jeep tour and it was great! There was 6 of us plus a guide. The guide was very knowledgable about all aspects of the island. It was great to here about the work the conservancy is doing to preserve the island, learn about the wildlife and the Wrigley family all while seeing the beautiful island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jamie80
50,The bison are incredible,"Catalina Island is a gem that is not to be missed. For me, the best part was the herd of huge bison, apparently descendants of ten or so bison left behind in by a film crew some seventy-five years ago when they couldn't find them when they had to return to the mainland.You'd think that it would be easy for the film crew to see an animal as big as a bison. Whatever the facts, kudos to the Conservancy for encouraging the herd to flourish and grow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DerAlteBach
50,Jeep tours of 2 or 5 hours best way to see wild Catalina,"Wrigley family of Chicago did huge national service by donating 88 percent of the island to be forever wild. 37 mile Catalina trail end to end has many camping spots. Bison herd = remnants of a movie filmed there (the bison footage never used). See endemic plants, unique Catalina red fox and birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudithD254
50,Must Do while on Catalina,"If you don't leave the main strip of Avalon, you are missing the real highlights of the island. Take an inland tour to see the wildlife and learn about the fascinating history of Catalina Island. We have been on several of these tours over the years and never get tired of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kazkey
50,Amazing Folks,"Thanks to Deanna, Rex, Rosie and Bear, I felt I learned the island inside and out. I hiked all three days and saw the coast, the interior, bison and foxes. The recommendations from the Conservancy were invaluable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/468evat
50,Must-do backcountry tours,"If you can only do one activity while on Catalina, take one of the Conservancy jeep tours of the backcountry. We did the three hour tour, and it was fantastic. Beth is an outstanding guide. She found plenty of bison and foxes for us to see, and had great information about the island.You can do similar commercial tours, but the Conservancy tours are always fantastic, and your money goes to the people protecting the nature on the island.Aside from the jeep tours, the Conservancy office can help you with your hiking plans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avalon2020
40,Lots of Desert type plants,"The Island is doing a great job in preserving their natural habitat. I love that they have created lots of hiking trails as well as mountain biking, which gives the visitors many options to view this beautiful desert island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinda10
50,Thrilling History Lesson by Jeep,"As we bumped and swayed down Catalina's dirt roads, our guide, Andrew, entertained and educated us about the history of Catalina Island. The eye catching island scenery, occasional glimpses of bison, peek at a winery (yes, a winery is being developed in the midst of a drought), Airport in the Sky, gorgeous coastal views, and much, much more made the 3 hour eco jeep tour fly by! Do heed the physical warnings on the website as the road can be a bumpy ride. This definitely is a trip the entire family can enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurelly
50,Conserving Catalina,"We appreciate the work of this organization. Our hiking visit was made easier by the friendly, informative information we received from the volunteers at the Avalon office where we registered to hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/graigf54
50,Take the Three Hour Tour with Beth,WOW and WOW. The three hour tour was fantastic. Our guide Beth has lived on the island since 1975 and knows every nook and cranny (as well as people)> Her knowledge of the history of the island was great!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Topspinut
50,An Island trip that is a must for first timers.,"By all means, include a half day island jeep tour in your plans while on Catalina. The guides are very knowledgeable and friendly. They'll take you places that you cannot get to on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barrym144
40,Beautiful Island away from Avalon,"This was my favorite part of our Catalina Island visit....the landscape and natural beauty is enjoyable. We did the jeep tour through the conservancy and it was very informative and personal. I would go back and do a hiking trip around the island. Avalon is very touristy, too much for my liking, but not a bad little town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasK293
50,Free Map,I stopped by the conservancy to inquire about biking around the island and to ask about hiking. Hiking is free but you have to register with the conservancy for safety reasons I assume. There is a charge to mountain bike into certain protected areas of the island (membership). I think I will do that on the next visit. Also I received a FREE trail map since it was my Birthday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaSnorkelQueen
50,The best day trip around,The natural plant life and wild life is breath taking. The golf cart ride is the best way to go.You car see the entire Island and stop and go at your own pace,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/973galen
50,Catalina Island Conservancy,The folks here were helpful and knowledgeable of the Island history. We used their transport to the Airport and took a great hike and the map was spot on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlsalviolo11
50,Jeep Tour!,"Highly recommended. This is an excellent escape from the hustle and bustle of Avalon. Even better, you will get a chance to visit areas the other tours won't visit. You will learn about the contributions that are being made by Conservancy personnel. You will also be contributing to their cause. Thank you Ron for a wonderful and most enlightening tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AddyMnz
50,Jeep Tour,"We took the 3 hour Jeep tour. Beth was our driver and tour guide, she was awesome. We learned so much from her and saw so much of the island. We saw quite a few Bison along the tour and some of the most spectacular views you could ever imagine. We loved all 3 hours of this tour and would recommend it to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylW845
50,Great tour,"The jeep tour was amazing!! The guide, Beth was great she really knew her way around the island. We wanted to see Bison and we saw a lot of Bison!! The tour felt like a private tour; it was just the 4 of us and the driver. I would highly recommend this tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aimeeloflin
50,Catalina Island Conservancy,We found this when we went on the 3hr jeep tour. The Catalina Island Conservancy is a must go to get all sorts of info concerning the island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanB990
50,Love my freewheeling pass!,"I've been twice now to the Conservancy at 125 Clarissa Avenue to get an annual bike pass to the island outside of Catalina. The good people there could not have been nicer. For $35, I get a pass, good advice, safety advice, and I know that my money is going to a great cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8944ANmikem
50,We had such an amazing time on our Tour!,"We were treated to a3 hour driving tour of the island by a family friend who is involved with the Conservancy. Our naturalist was very informed and friendly. He knew everything about the topography, natural elements, and history of the island. He took us to some amazing photography-perfect places ""off the beaten path"". The drive was fun, exciting, and a great learning experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meg2LD
50,Great tour and tour guide!,"We had a wonderful 3 hr. tour with a knowledgeable tour guide. When booking a tour, you can designate things that interest you and they are covered in the tour. We saw bison, island fox, woodpecker, and eagles. We also learned some history of the island and some about the flora and fauna. Beautiful, scenic and informative tour",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D9416DWlindaw
50,Not to be missed!,"Went with my husband and 12 year old grandson. We all loved the tour. Charles was our guide and he has been giving these tours for seven years. He was extremely knowledgeable and made sure everyone had a good time. The ride is on dirt roads, in an open air jeep, high up on mountain trails with amazing views. We were totally surrounded by nature. We saw dolphin jumping in the water. Falcons flying overhead. One bison lazying in the grass. Charles made sure everyone was able to get a photo shot of the bison from every angle imaginable. This was a two hour tour. We loved the tour so much will go back for the 4 1/2 hour tour to see a different part of the island (on a another visit). CAUTION: There is a steep step up to get into the jeep. The tour company warns you that the road is bumpy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734barbaras734
30,Back Roads of Catalina island,"Teresa and I decided to see what else was happening on this island during our getaway, so we hopped a tour with the island conservancy (since most of the island is under their control). We opted for the 3 hr. tour to see as much as we could. Our driver, Beth was very knowledgeable but had failing equipment on the jeep that made it either hard to hear her or we could not hear her at all ( come on you guys, help the lady out,you certainly charge enough). We learned some of the history of Avalon, saw some bison and some remarkable views of the west coast that reminded me of big sur. We stopped at the ""airport in the sky"" and as we were walking on the tarmac, heading towards the runway the guy in the tower told us, over the loud speaker, that we were not allowed on there ( I hope we didn't wake him, it is such a busy place). I was just trying to find out how the planes go over the edge occasionally. We saw the only vineyard (Rusak wine I believe) on the island and learned it would be expanded. Thanks to Beth for taking the photos for everyone, and her familiarity with all those dirt roads allowed her to move very quickly so check that seat belt and hold on tight. Now that's excitement.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickTrippin
50,See the Bison up close,"The price of the 2 1/2 hour open jeep tour was about $220.00 for 2 people. But the experience was great. Only the Conservancy can get you access to most of the island. We saw Bison on the way to the airport, which was a stop. Then we drove and saw the large herd of Bison, which there were over 100 of them right near the road. It was great to be close and get really good photos. Of course you are not getting out of the jeep. We also went to a beach campground on the other side of the island, which was beautiful. The driver provides so much information about the island's history and current status. It was well worth the expense for the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gumshoe2000
40,wow.. what a place,this place is truly majestic. i went on a 2 hous off road tour of this great landscape and it was really informative and interesting. not to mention that the island is jut a gorgeous place to be!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommyv937
50,Amazingly Fun and Interesting!,"Wow.. what can I say! Our three hour tour of Santa Catalina island with the Conservancy Jeep Eco Tour was amazing! Carlos.. our tour guide took us to the Airport in the Sky.. mountain vistas.. Bison grazing land, Coves, Historic sites, and an Eagle Aviary. I highly recommend taking a tour with the Conservancy and supporting their Mission.. ""Our mission is to be a responsible steward of our lands through a balance of conservation, education and recreation."" (source-catalinaconservancy.org). Thank you so much Carlos for your contribution in keeping this beautiful Island pristine. We enjoyed you immensely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CZeyha
50,Unforgettable experience,"My husband and I took the jeep Eco tour offered by the conservancy, which takes you to parts of the island that cannot be enjoyed otherwise. Through this tour we were able to not only see first hand the work the conservancy does to protect the islands flora and fauna species but also meet with only a few feet of distance some of the creatures they protect like the American Bison which both had my heart pounding out of my chest at experiencing their majestic size and willingness to come really close to you, and total awe at seeing how loving they are to their herd and young ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillescas
40,More scenery and history than wildlife,"This was a fun and educational scenic tour of the island. The jeep is covered on top but open on the sides and they provide water. The roads are very rough in places, which I found fun, but those with bad backs may want to find another activity. It was not remotely cold when we went in mid-April; in fact it was very comfortable. Our guide was knowledgeable, laid-back, and friendly, patient with questions and enthusiastic about the island. He took us to see a group of buffalo hanging out by the side of the road, which was pretty cool. For the most part, this was just a nice way to see a lot more of the island than you usually get to access and hear a lot of the local history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laene
50,Jeep ride,We enjoyed the jeep ride up to the Airport in the Sky. It was very windy but our guide was very knowledgeable about the island and the conservancy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/664barbw
40,Worth stopping in.,"As you travel around Avalon, stop in at the Conservancy and learn a bit about the island and its habitats for fish, bird and creatures. It also has a very clean restroom. Nice spot on the ""golf cart tour.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dagnytags
50,Very interesting,"We took a jeep tour, and were so interested in the history they spoke about. The views were very cool and the entire project is so worthwhile, that the cost of this tour was totally worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teambr0wn4
50,Hummer 4 1/2 hour trip to the back Island.,"We had a great trip in the Hummer, Charles was our tour guide and we loved him. GReat info and easy to listen to.Got to see places you wouldn't get to otherwise. Worth the time and cost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bld61
50,Great Knowledge of Island,We booked a guided tour thru the Conservancy because family member is a Dossent member on the coast of California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HavBagWiLLTravel
50,What a trip!,"Andrew drove us into the interior of the island where we encountered squirrels, woodpeckers, hummingbirds, a fox and bison. His knowledge of the history of the island combined with the stunning beauty of the windward side of the island made this tour worth twice the price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilP549
50,Must-Visit in Southern California,"Very nice 1-hr ferry ride from Long Beach and a great full day of impressions on the Island - particularly on a sunny day all year round. We were there on Dec 31st and enjoyed it very much. Best way to explore is to hire a golf-car - the road circles the island and gets you pretty high up - so you get breath-taking views of the ocean front shores down. A great place to have lunch is a cafe right on the beach past the ""Tower"" (housing a casino, I think), next to an old yacht lying on the shore. As you drop off the golf-car and wait for your return boat, a walk in the old town with its small shops, cafes and an old peer (we have seen a couple of seals!) is also very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergeyb677
50,Amazing day on an Eco Tour,"four hours in a comfortable jeep, fun, friendly tour guide Ron took us all through the real Catalina...saw all the animals, beautiful trails, gorgeous beaches, unspoiled ecosystems, learned about the history and preservation of this glorious Californian treasure. Bucket List event for our group for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peninsula4
40,"Good trails, good views, bison herd",Many trails in the conservancy. Must hike them if you are here. Check out my review of the Catalina Trans Trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adcjones
50,Mountain Biking the Resserve,"I took the Catalina Express to the island. The trip was fast and comfortable. We then got to the island and went to the conservancy to get our 1 year pass to access the entire island. We started the ride at sea level and climed to 1700 feet. The ride was hard but great and the views were really fantastic. You can rent a bike to do this, but for $8 you can bring your own bike over on the ferry. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YpsiSteve
50,Wedding,A magical wedding venue for our nephew. We only were able to spend four days there but loved every minute. Plenty of shops and restaurants although we found them a bit expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluetopaz49
50,A nice surprise,"Went on the 3 hour tour but accompanied by a TV crew from LA! Andrew who was the guide was a top man and took us to a few places others may not visit - tv crew must have helped!Go on this tour rather than the Hummer one which is commercial, whilst this one the money raised goes to run the conservancy.We're out for 3 1/2 hours in the end and saw lots of Bison and even a giant squirrel.Excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tardis1956
50,Outstanding Jeep Eco Tour,"Our tour guide, Scott, took us on a wonderful tour of the island. He was extremely knowledgeable. We saw several buffalo along the way. I highly recommend this tour. You get to see places generally off limits to visitors. It offers great views of the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1325KVjenniferm
50,Jeep Eco Tour - Highly Recommended!,"We took the 3 hour Jeep Ecotour through the Catalina Island Conservancy and had a fantastic experience. We were in a four passenger Jeep and had Beth. She was the best!Beth has lived on the island since the early 1960s and know every inch of the island. Together with a another very nice couple, we took a Jeep tour to parts of the island restricted to most vehicles and people.We got to see a lot of wildlife, scenery and learned a lot about the island's history through Beth. We ended the trip with a stop by the historic airport before heading back into tour.I would highly recommend Beth (I am sure the other guides are good) as her personality of very laid back and she is genuinely interested in showing you the island and aspects that you wouldn't otherwise ever get to see.I am going to post a few pics from the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slgoulet1
50,We took their 3-hour tour of the interior - fantastic!,"We saw bison, and beautiful views of the beaches, learned a lot about the island. The Wrigley family is still quite a force on the island and maintain a ranch there, along with owning a good deal of property. Native Americans lived a peaceful, good life there until the white man came along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543jg
50,This Conservancy really gives so much to all.,"The Conservancy has so many areas they help with. The flora and fauna of the island, the animals as well as the people who live there. DO get into the interior via land/jeep tours or by boat. There is so much to learn and appreciate on this historic island.There are informative kiosks around Avalon as well as all over the island along the hiking trails and jeep/bus trips. All employees and volunteers are VERY well trained and friendly. You will be happy you explored Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shesailor1
50,Three Hour Tour Left Us Wanting for More,"We thoroughly enjoyed the three tour put on by Beth, a long time native of the island and Conservancy employee. We were able to ride off road, visit beautiful coves, observe several Bison, a deer, a bald eagle in flight and one in the Preserve. The island is so much more than Avalon. I appreciated that the money we paid for the tour goes back into the preservation efforts. Wish we had time for the half day tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dawn92106
50,Something for everyone and everyone's budget,"Who would expect learning, having adventure for all type of people ,wonderful informative personal COULD BE THIS MUCH FUN!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648melindas
50,"Bike the Island, unforgettable","I biked the island, and it was an unforgettable experience. For thing is first, you have to get a permit for $35 for an annual membership/permit from the Catalina Island Conservancy. From Avalom and with the permit you can get a lift to the airport in the sky for $10. The ride down is physically easy with limited hills, but FIX & CHECK YOUR BREAKS before you start the journey. This is a downhill trip, and you are next to a 2000 foot hillside. I am big guy and I am scared of heights, but I was able to do it no problem, just make sure the breaks are in top condition and you will be fine. The trip actually goes way fast than I expected to a 10 mile journey. I guess because is mostly downhill. Enjoy yourself :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZackaryS
50,Catalina Island,The Conservancy is doing their absolute best to re-seed the interior of the Island after a fire raged through in 2006. We took 2 tours through The Santa Catalina Island Company because 10% of the money goes back into the Conservancy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/506RebeccaW
50,Private Eco-jeep tour,Thank goodness we opted for the 4 hour private tour! We really got the feel of Catalina Island. Just a short distance from the main hub you are in the mountains with breathe-taking views. Our driver Laura was so very knowledgable. We all decided it was our favorite part of visiting Catalina Island,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawmomx4
50,Eco-Jeep Tour,"We scored on this one...we were the only 2 on a normally 6 person tour. Scott, our guide took us all over the island - really tailored the trip to our interests. It was a highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cathys981
40,Jeep Tour,"We enjoyed our 2 hour jeep tour of the island. If I could do it all over again, I would go with the three hour tour just to see more of the island. It was a very informative and interesting tour. We didn't see a lot of wildlife, but we all know you can't predict that.I would recommend getting reservations ahead of time on line, as the tour size is small (6 people per Jeep) and the demand is high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deserthoover
40,Interesting facts about the island.,"Some really great paintings on display that I was told may be available for auction, as they are changed every year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/557nadinem

50,Great way to explore the island!,"We booked a three hour Jeep tour on our first visit to Catalina Island, and had a wonderful experience. Our guide, Scott, was friendly, funny, and very knowledgeable. We saw so much of the island that is otherwise inaccessible, including bison and eagles. AMAZING views! We'd highly recommend this to others!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyCamper796
30,nice place for info about Catalina,"if you need help, recommended hiking trails/ areas and a permit to get to back country - here's the place - smallish size and hard to find but wealth of info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoxanneM829
50,2 hour backcountry jeep tour,"Our guide, Beth, was knowledgable and entertaining. We joined 4 others visitors in the jeep. It was a much more personalized tour than others advertised. Our guide asked us to identify goals for the back country trek; we saw every animal the group indentified including Bison, bald eagle, fox, deer, blue heron, and golden eagle. Water was available for guests.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/286nancya
50,Least expensive Maps for the Island here :),"I always like stopping at the Catalina Island Conservancy when I go to Catalina. You can register your hike there, as I usually take a hike around the island. (not literally as big island... maybe some year.) Friendly and helpful staff will guide you and help you choose a hike that will suit your needs, plus they have all sorts of info about the City of Avalon and island in general. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billdW480TW
40,Jeep Eco Tour,"Must do if you would like to see more of Catalina Island besides Avalon. Our guide, Ron, took us to areas not open to golf carts, and was very knowledgeable of Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/650bend
40,Took the van to the Airport for a hike.,Good way to see the interior of the island. The road is a tab bumpy but van goes at just the right rate of speed. Great little loop trail around the airport -- about 2.3 miles. We were hoping to see bison and/or fox but were skunked. Enjoyed the hike nonetheless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnC685
50,What a wonderful drive!,"We had a great ride! Part of the group didn't show up, so there was just the two of us, another person and our driver. Enjoyed the scenery! Unusually clear! We could see the mountains on the mainland! Appreciated learning about the history of the island. Saw a couple bison. They posed nicely for photos, but I gave them plenty of space! I know they look soft and cuddly, but the stories we heard clearly indicate the opposite. Please enjoy from a distance. Your outcome will be better. Loved the little beaches and coves. I was happy to spot a bald eagle in the wild and then enjoy both a bald and a golden in captivity. We needed a break from the chaos and this truly was a delightful afternoon. Be sure to bring your jacket with you! The wind really can pick up along the tops of the ridges. Bring some water too! We did stop at the airport to use the restroom and get a snack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857colleeno
50,Wild Wild West,This was breathtaking. We took the four hour tour and was amazed at how the island has been preserved. We seen a herd of bison on both sides of our Jeep. Now you just don't see that everyday well worth the money. Must see!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421jeanninec
50,Friendly and Helpful,"Convienent location, great stories about the island and info on local mounain hikes! Very friendly staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N155TH
50,Oh the views!,"We tried to book another jeep tour that was sold out, and our innkeeper told us about the Conservancy and called to book us on one of their tours. Lucky for us that the back up plan turned out the be exactly what we were looking for. Our driver grew up on the island and knew every detail and every inch of the island. We went into areas that not all vehicles can access, learned about the history past and present, and were treated to spectacular views on both sides of the island. We had several bison sightings, stopped to see the bald eagle and golden eagle, and ended with a treat when a fox ran in front of us. What a lovely day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haveagoodday365
50,Great Stewards,Had a little interaction with the Conservancy on a few tours. They seem to really care about the island and preserving the flora and fauna there. Send them a few bucks to help out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElkGroveChris
50,excellent information,provided information and maps for hiking the island or taking tours. The people were well informed and enjoyed telling you about the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PNG98
30,Disorganized,"First off, the conservancy headquarters is located on a side-street, with just a small sign to let you know you've arrived. Their entrance is from their driveway, which is generally filled with large tour jeeps and golf-carts. There is a pretty street with a large door around the corner, but you cannot enter/exit from there because its blocked off. Not very welcoming.This group is (supposedly) all about conservancy and yet they do nothing to rid the island of the gross pollution from the 2-stroke golf-carts. Both the pollution and the noise from the carts shouldn't be allowed to continue. The conservancy should really try to do something about that.The conservancy charges $35 passes for interior hiking, biking, overnights, and camping in the interior. Its a rip-off but you have no choice. You can buy your pass online and its good for a year.Basically, if you want to hike or bike beyond the small confines of Avalon, you MUST purchase a conservancy pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamSelz
40,O k if you missed it,they had nice displays of island information and artifacts. It was located on the road to the Wrigley Memorial.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenB982

50,Catalina Jeeping,"Great trip to the airport and around the ""wild"" parts of the island (no, not the nightclubs!). Saw fox, ground squirrels, bison, eagles, and the view of Avalon from above. Great adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/958jess
50,Jeep Eco Tours are the way to go!,"We took the historical tour up to the airport and then added an off road hour to see more. When we return we want to take the trip to the end of the island. Our guide, Andrew Hobbs was knowledgeble, a great narrator and passionate about conserving the natural parts of the island. It's great knowing that you can customize your tour a bit (especially after the first tour), rather than being on a bus. The Conservancy doesn't have money to use for marketing but if you take the ferry over, take the ferry's magazine and mention it to the Conservancy to get a discount on the price of the tour.,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyD100
