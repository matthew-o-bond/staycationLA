50,Great Park for Tykes,"Visiting from out of town and took our 11-month old grandson to try out the playground. What a pleasure to have sturdy equipment--swings, slide, climbing, riding things--with sand and cushioned ground cover. Everything is first-rate. Age-appropriate, clean, friendly. A playground for older children was set apart. Wanted to visit the adjacent public library but didn't open until Noon. The perimeter of the Park has a hard-pack walking trail, perfect for baby strollers, walkers, and joggers. Expansive lawn area but was off limits, perhaps due to saturation from the rainy weather all week. Parking relatively easy. Thank you Santa Monica. We'll be back.",Helen G

Families are enjoying activities because of a big grassy field, basketball field, playground for kids and a branch of the local library.
