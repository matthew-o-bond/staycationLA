50,Jewel Box,"This one-room gallery within the very green campus (extensive lawns, olive trees, and shrubbery) of Scripps College has an active exhibits and lecture seriers. In their current ""Asian Art Treasures at Scripps College (Aug. 31 - Dec. 15, 2019) one of the unique stars was an Indian minature on ivory from the Denison Library College. This gallery is open from 12 - 5, Wed. - Sunday with free admission. Although small, the stunning pieces in this show highlighted the depth and breadth of the Asian art at Scripps College. Dotted throughout the campus are sculptures, such as the small bronze of Harriet Tubman (the full sized piece is in Brooklyn) in the adjacent courtyard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
