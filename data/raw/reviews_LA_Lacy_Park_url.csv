50,Great place to walk the dogs,This is a great park lots of trees and some great walking paths. That’s why it’s a great place to walk your dogs. This place is in San Marino so it’s very well kept. There is a great rose garden as well.,Gary P
40,a lovely oasis,Lacy Park is a great place to stretch your legs. Be warned there is an entrance fee on weekends if you are not from the neighborhood. a nice field for picnics,Raymond S
50,Spacious Park to do Morning Walk,I come here on Fridays and Saturdays to do my morning walk. It is relaxing to be here as it has many trees and plants around and a path where children/adults can ride their bikes and scooter and the outer path is mainly for walking or jogging. The grounds are well-maintained and many dog owners walk their dogs as they enjoy the park. Squirrels are every where and sometimes they can be blocking your path. Birds fly and the cool breeze in the park adds to the beauty of this park. There is a playground where younger children can play and benches where the parents/caregivers can sit and watch. Some people come here to do their exercise and some yoga too. It is a safe place where you can walk and enjoy the day.,annminky

50,Beautiful Vast Park/Garden Well Maintained,"I went for a photo shoot of my wife (ex models never stop loving having their pictures taken). I was not too excited about the prospect, but was pleasantly surprised by the size of the park and it not being hilly or crowded. It has a play area with equipment for children and has a rose garden on the west end and an outer ring of a road where there are trees particularly from Australia, but also from the SE USA and even a few redwoods from CA; and most amazingly they are labeled. Entrance is free during the week with a charge of $4/head on the weekend for non residents.",David A
40,Nice park in nice neighborhood; seems like being in the country,"Lacy Park is a hidden gem in San Marino as it is located in the middle of the residential area. Yet it seems like a different world as it is very big with large lawns and green areas. There are very old and large trees. There is a very new playground area for children and there is also a tennis center. There are picnic tables and there are several rings of walkways that circumnavigate around the park for walkers and bikers. A very relaxing place that you can escape the city and breathe the fresh air. It's only a short distance away from The Huntington Library. There is a fee for non-residents of San Marino on the weekends, but during the weekdays, the park is free for all.",geotech522
