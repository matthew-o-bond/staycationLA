40,Great bar & food,"Came across this place by chance, not very busy which could be off putting but we enjoyed some good food (pizza) and an amazingly wide selection of craft beers which they happily allow you to sample before purchase. Well worth a visit, very friendly and helpful staff too, enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steppin-owt
50,Awesome Brews,"The Dudes brewery has a great selection and a great staff! Thanks James,Ryan and Courtney for a fun time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raybeck1
40,Good craft beers,"Good craft beers at The Dudeâ€™s Brewing Co in the heart of Santa Monica Shopping District, near the Santa Monica Pier. Nice terrace.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ochassot
30,"Dog-friendly, Standard Beer & Rude Staff",5 star for being dog-friendly.3 star for the quality of the beer. It has the standard selection you'd expect from a craft brewery.1 star for the rude staff. They had a Groupon offer so it was really busy the day we went. We didn't have a Groupon and we're paying full price for everything we got. We were very gruffly told that we weren't allowed to have a flight because the Groupon redeemers needed them. The rudeness continued until we finished our transaction. I get being busy but it's not that hard to be nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricialO4645VZ
20,So many better options,The beer isn't anything special. There are a ton of better breweries within a few miles. They do offer a lot of groupon that are a descent deal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adampF2584WS
20,Poor Beers,"Went to check out this local brewery, and unfortunately the beer was not very good. The atmosphere here is fine although nothing special. I thought maybe the beer would help fix that problem, but I left wanting to go drink somewhere else to try some better beer. Overall I'd probably skip this place next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakea88
50,The Brew Dudes' go to place,"Wonderful place to have a brew and talk with fellow dudes.Urban setting with picnic benches so you can chat with fellow brew fans.Very friendly staff.Dr. Mango is obviously a fan of ""The Big Lebowski"" and the reminders of the movie abound, including having your flight of beer served on a bowling pin.One of the most interesting beers was the ""White Russian"" and all you fans of the Big Lebowski (and all you little lebowski urban achievers).Most of their beers are sold in cans to go (aka mini mini kegs for the less than illuminati) and one of the brewers told me the ""White Russian"" will be sold in cans soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorMango
50,Great experience,We ended our day of ISO meetings here tasting excellent beer. Food was served and we really enjoyed ourselves. This places is highly recommended if you like local beer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taarhaug
50,Um...dude?,"Ok. This place us pretty cool despite the not so cool name. Urban brewery warehouse setting with no frills. And all i overhear are Lebowski quotes. Dude where's my brewery? That's the right movie, right?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andybP67ZH
30,Good choice of taprooms!,"Nice clean, open, airy taproom with great views of the brewing area. Plenty of tables, seating inside and out. Quiet, relaxed crowd the evening we visited.We opted for the tasting flights and did our best to sample everything offered on the menu. We found some great brews like Grandmas pecan brown which we rated at 4 points and others that we were not too fond of like the White Russian imperial stout which we rated at 1 point. Your mileage may vary depending upon what is currently offered and your personal preferences.Overall this taproom has some nice depth in terms of selection compared to other local taprooms and is definitely worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nprvl
