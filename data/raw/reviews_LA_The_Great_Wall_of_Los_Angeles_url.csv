40,Long mural along the inside wall of the canal,"The Great Wall is a very long mural along the inside wall of the canal. You see it best if you park and walk in the park area, along the trail, overlooking the canal. The wall is very long with paintings of numerous events throughout history such as the Great Depression the Japanese internment WW1, WW2, Edison, Einstein and much much more. If you are interested in historical artwork this is worth visiting. Even if you are mildly interested, it is a nice walk in the (narrow) park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinaNtravel

50,"Amazing art, amazing stories","Little known art gem free to the public, the Great Wall of LA is about a half-mile stretch of the Tujunga Flood Control Channel which is the site of an incredibly visionary project bringing the City of Los Angeles, professional artists, kids from the community, and some kids from the juvenile justice system together to research, formulate, and execute a pictorial history of the Los Angeles area. The images are imaginative, intriguing, and vibrantly colorful. The longer you gaze at a section, the more meaningful details you see. The contributions of little known people, named on the mural, can be easily looked up on a mobile device. Incredible history lessons, presented in a variety of art styles. Many images use the rich, vibrant style of Southern Californian street art. Truly worth seeing and appreciating. Parking is free on Coldwater Canyon Drive for 2 hours. There is a paved walking path along the whole section, although some sections are roughened by the encroachment of tree roots. You'll want to leave the paved path and walk over to the wire fence to get a better look at the mural. There is good information about the mural online that is helpful in understanding the mural. Great history lesson for out of town visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randylee223
50,All of California history in less than a mile,"This extremely well done mural depicts all of California history from ancient times to the late 20th century, largely from the point of view from the inhabitants. Many history books tell how the Spanish missionaries came to California to enlighten the natives. Well, that's not how the ""natives"" saw it. The series of panels runs for better part of a mile along a concrete tributary of the Los Angeles River.Although the story begins with prehistory, the emphasis is on the 18th through 20th centuries. There is a lot of attention to women and minorities and their points of view, which are often ignored in history books. The art work is extremely well done, and the panels flow seamlessly from one to another. This is definitely a class act and well with the trouble to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globe_trotter_100
40,A true gem in the valley,I have been admiring this landmark throughout my entire life and it is a great perspective on history and the struggle. It is a respected piece of art that shall be enjoyed for generations to come. My Cousin Josh has a replica of a couple different parts of the wall in his house. It shows how loved this piece of Valley Village truly is.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436stug
50,A Walk Back Through History,"The Great Wall of Los Angles, we were there and its a wonderful description of history.It's located on the cement wall of the Los Angles river. Its easy to find of your GPS.If you drive by the high school go back and turn right at the light. The murals are wonderful. Only a one half mile one way, easy parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LloydWinstead
50,What a jewel!,This is the most amazing mural which depicts the history of California through the 1950's. There are many panels I'd never heard of before that I want to research. The mural itself is of significance as it is among the top three longest murals in the world. And it's right here in our backyard!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MCACUNA
40,Excellent leftist history of LA/CA - perfect discussion point,"This is a wonderful history of LA/CA from a leftist perspective. It's 1/2 mile of art work, planned by a well-known public artist and professor and painted by 400 students and their families beginning about 40 years ago and restored a few years ago. Easy enough to walk the 1/2 mile and look across the ""river"" (the concrete basin with some water) of Coldwater Canyon from east to west. Unfortunately you can't walk on the river here, but you can see plenty. This would be an ideal ""teaching moment"" for anyone - you can take a section of the wall and ask questions about the history... e.g., why is that woman whispering in Thomas (spelled Tomas here) Edison's ear? why is Edison there at all? Lots of info on the web too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RomeTheSecondTime
50,Human rights history of Los Angeles in art,"This is an amazing public art piece that should not be missed by either art fans or history buffs. Begun in 1976, the Great Wall of LA depicts the history of the area primarily from the perspective of its human inhabitants. It begins with prehistory, then the Chumash natives (although the Tongva were the primary tribe of LA, they are not federally recognized), and on through European and Mexican colonization, through to the modern era. While some natural and cultural events are depicted, the emphasis is on human rights atrocities and struggles. I learned a few things I had never heard before, such as the Mexican deportation of the early 20th century. It is well worth stopping to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSPDX
50,A Must Do Adventure in Art in LA,"What an amazing accomplishment and vision. The refurbishment of this expansive mural has brighten and re-energized the mural, the colors now pop! An experience off the beaten path and not your ordinary are ""scene"". Well worth the trip, experience, and conversations of LA's history that it elicits. Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,Really worth seeing,"I know many tourists like commercial things or big-deal attractions, and this isn't among them. It's a half-mile-long mural painted by local people depicting the history of California and Los Angeles. Colors are bright. The mural is clean and free of graffiti -- maybe because it was done by graffiti artists.It's advertised as being part of Los Angeles, but we found it in a brochure for attractions in North Hollywood. You can't see much of it just driving by. You have to park your car and get out. Then walk along a little grassy strip and look through a chain-link fence. If you have a good camera and know how to use manual focus (or how to fool the camera) you can shoot it without the fence being much of a problem. Very serious photographers could take a small stepstool and see over the fence.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44Boppa
30,Ok,"Maybe this is worth seeing if you have a car to get there but on public transport, we had to walk a long way or wait a long time for buses. It was kind of cool but not worth the hassle to get there.I should say that my boyfriend really enjoyed it.Also a few tips if you do go - don't start at the address listed on trip advisor. The wall runs along Coldwater Canyon Avenue but it is in chronological order starting at the corner of Burbank Boulevard. If you start at Oxnard St, you'll be seeing the events in reverse order.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyh327
50,beautiful history of theVS,"This is no messy graffiti !!! It's made by graffiti artists .Very beautiful to see. You can see on the wall the history of VS . The wall is 0,5 Miles long .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Johan33
50,The Great Wall of Los Angeles - Longest Mural in the World!,"This mural is over 2700 feet long and is one of the most colorful and interesting murals one will ever see. .'Begun in 1974 and completed over five summers, the Great Wall employed over 400 youth and their families from diverse social and economic backgrounds working with artists, oral historians, ethnologists, scholars, and hundreds of community members.' Quoted from Judy Baca - DesignerI like murals. I love Great Murals and this Mural is Great! It goes on and on and is a timeline of Los Angeles history. The colors are brilliant and the quality of the work is exceptional! If you live nearby, it is worthy of periodic trips to learn more and more about LA history. If you are and out of towner, then allow an hour or more to take a stroll, and be amazed and bring your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleySays
