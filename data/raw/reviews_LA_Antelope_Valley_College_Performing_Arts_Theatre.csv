40,A Very Nice Venue for Any Function,"I attended a number of events here, the AV Orchestra, the AV Chorale, and a Congressional reception. The acoustics are wonderful and the chairs are comfortable. The entire facility is well maintained and a fun place to visit at any time.",EllieRKay
50,Excellent Theatre Facility,"AVC has done a superb job with this theatre. The theatre/music departments continually put on top quality shows, and it is definitely worth looking into what they have to offer. I enjoyed the production of Handel's Messiah this last Christmas directed by Dr. Berkeley Price. It is also worth looking into their applied music concerts.",christian f
