50,"A great place in the heart of Pomona, California!","I was invited to see the Anna Silver exhibit at the American Museum of Ceramic Art. This museum WOWed me! Plus, there was a whole lot of instruction happening.The collection of art was very impressive. The store was great for holiday or wedding gifts! The location allowed for ample FREE parking! The cost of entry was very reasonable.Check out the exhibits in the bank vault - (The museum use to be a bank!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Fun and Hands on Museum!,"Small art museum, a true gem in the Inland Empire. I took my kids to Saturday Family Day and we all had so much fun... My kids definitely have a bigger appreciation for clay and pottery art work now.The museum is super well run, with several very interesting exhibitions that change though out the year. Some artist have their art work for sale.We had a private tour of Juan Quezada artwork and life history. after that we were able to try to make our own clay work-of-art, it was fantastic! Not many museums let you have a hands on experience.The museum has an adjacent large studio where pottery class is taught, they have classes for adults and kids, during the week and on weekends. Both my kids asked to be signed up for classes, they definitely had a great time.This is a definitely family outing worth the drive for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865lennyi
50,Exceptional museum in an eclectic arts colony location,"AMOCA is a hidden gem! It is located in downtown Pomona, an area with a vibrant arts community; visit on the second Saturday evening of each month when all the art galleries are open and music surrounds. The exhibits at this museum are of exceptional quality and the vibe of the crowd is engaged and relaxed; this museum is not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BertPH
50,"Small museum, impressive collection","We spent a very wonderful hour viewing items from the permanent collection, and two special exhibits. We also,had the chance to talk to the very knowledgeable and engaging staff. If you are interested in ceramics, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3079VSstevel
50,Neat tour,"Toured this place while catching up with an old college buddy whom I hadn't seen since our USC days 22 years ago and who's now running for Congress (Sean Flynn for Congress). Impressive exhibits, plus one of the current ceramics students graciously gave us a tour of the students' works-in-progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrojanSkyCop1
40,An interesting change of pace,"On the day I came, the museum had two galleries closed for reinstallation so we only got to see the main exhibition and two small exhibits. We also got to tour the workshop which is large and had people working on pieces in various stages so it was quite educational. There are many pieces for sale in the gift shop. I thought the prices were reasonable but I am no expert. We spent a nice hour here and it was worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1
50,This is a wonderful museum with interesting rotating exhibitions,"I am a painter, but love to see craft, especially ceramics, for the expressive possiblilities of the medium. The show we saw was an amazing survey illustrating the expressiveness of clay to convey a message. Technique varied widely and the variety was astonishing. The show was about current society and politics and work ranged from the monumental to the diminutive--crude to exquisite. The museum shop is a marvel with amazing work from vessels to decorative pieces at very reasonable prices. We spent more than two hours here, but there was a lecture and special event. Even so, plan at least an hour to take in everything. The curator is extremely knowledgable and adventuresome. Loved finding this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robb1n419
50,Wonderful Collections,"This museum is a living, breathing, constantly transforming expression of art. Works by local artists, it's variety and depth of talent are breathtaking. Highly recommended. Not far off a freeway, it is also easily accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadyfeet
40,Museum tour and ceramics workshop,"I brought my high school Girl Scout troop here for a tour and a ceramics workshop. The exhibits rotate, so you will see something different than what we saw, but I'm sure the curator is always interesting - we learned a lot about Chinese porcelain and gained an appreciation of the process. When it was time for the workshop, the instructor was very patient and explained the steps in a way the girls could understand, so it wasn't at all intimidating. Everyone had a great time (and ended up with a gift to give family). The workshop required 2 visits because we had to leave the items to be fired, then return to pain them. If you were only going to the exhibit, an hour would probably be enough time because the space isn't particularly large. You don't need reservations to go to the exhibit, but I think you would need them for a workshop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/catsaway9
40,A nice find for the admission price,"AMOCA is a somewhat small museum but with very nice exhibits and an incredible mural in the main hall. There's also a working ceramic studio in the back where you can see creativity in action. I also liked their gift shop with very well priced ceramics for purchase. It's a good deal. If you're in the Pomona area, you should stop by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY
50,The Magic of Clay,"I love this museum. Amazing exhibitions, museum store, permanent collection, lectures, free family days AND a huge studio. They just opened up a new exhibition space (that is beautiful) with Dirk Staschke's exhibition.Combine your visit with the museums in Claremont or a visit to Maloof.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoxieBoston
40,AMOCA visit,This is a small museum but worth your time if you have an interest in ceramics. Artists work is nicely displayed with texts to explain and/or name what you are seeing. There is an area where people are working on projects. I believe you can take lessons and/or rent work space if you want to. There is a lovely gift shop where you can buy individual ceramics. Expect to spend one to three hours depending on your interest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/946nanr
50,If you enjoy ceramics,"My wife and I are retired Ceramics teachers and art lovers and never miss an opportunity to visit the AMOCA whenever we are near Pomona. It offers a variety of shows - from one person retrospectives, to particular countries or cultures, to general time periods or styles. We have never been disappointed with the quality of the work. It has a large main gallery with side galleries and an large educational ceramic studio in the rear. If you pay the yearly membership fee you also get membership in the North American Reciprocal Museum(NARM)Association - free admission to over 650 participating institutions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDNandJN
50,unique,very specialized museum. unique to ceramics. incredible pieces on display. Maybe the only such museum on the west coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silconvalleyvisitor
40,Unique Museum,Looking to kill an hour or so??? This is the perfect little spot to go to and explore ceramics of different eras...mostly tho from the early to mid 20th century. They seem to have various gallery displays so it may change however the essence of the museum is to showcase the variety of ceramics from around the globe. The 2 galleries that I saw were having to do with re-purposing old ceramics and they also had a separate gallery with Villeroy & Boch (V&B) items from the late 19th Century to the 20th Century. Very interesting history of the company. They were also showing a short film that used ceramic Victorian figurines as the characters....very cute.I would not recommend bringing very young or restless children here as many of the displays are in the open and would be very easy for a child (or anyone for that matter) to touch.There is also a working ceramics studio located inside the museum. You can visit that area and they have their own store where you can purchase a variety of artwork. Not sure what classes they offer but certainly something to look into if you are interested in ceramics!All in all a very unique place! A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fechef
40,Small but nice,"This is a very small museum, but very well organized. I could also visit the ceramic studio and talk to some of the artists, as a clay artist myself I found it very interesting.The museum shop is the best, they have beautiful collection from very famous artists. Although the museum is small I spent a lot of time there and enjoyed every bit of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALMC27
50,Great workshops,"I love art but I don't have any experience working with ceramics. My organization hosted a party at AMOCA - wine, cheese, and clay! The AMOCA instructors were fabulous; super friendly, even after I got wine-annoying. Everyone had a great time. I'm not sure of the cost, but all materials were provided. I'm looking to take some classes with my wife this summer just for the fun of working with my hands.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/891treet
50,Great museum,"This is a really fun, intimate museum. They are currently working on having a permanent collection; however, in the main gallery are revolving works featuring some of the best ceramic artists, such as Elaine Katzer, Betty Davenport Ford and Chris Gustin (to name just a few!). You can also see works from the old masters such as Peter Voulkos and Paul Soldner. Attached to the museum is a wonderful studio where you can see ceramic artists working. The studio also offers a variety of classes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hop0409
40,Lots to see!,"The enthusiastic docent told me that AMOCA is the largest museum of its kind. Housed in a former bank building, the vault had its own exhibit (when I was there, artwork that included gold). You could easily spend an hour looking at all of the items in the Mettlach Collection downstairs. The mural of Pomona history on the ground floor isn't ceramic, but it's worth a visit on its own; it lines one long wall of the main exhibition space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/An0nyMs
40,Interesting class for kids,"AMOCA is located off Garey Ave. in the former PFF bank building. You will see the bank vaults and that the museum kept the beautiful Millard Sheets mural which is on the wall of the main room. It is historical and tells the story of the Valley. AMOCA is a small and friendly museum, and they offer so much. We took a ceramic pottery class and the instructor was sweet to the children. We will visit again. About $20 for the 3 hr. class.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Ceracis studio,"They have a very large facility here with gallery showroom, gift store, ample parking, constantly changing displays, very large studio with kilns, throwing wheels, glazes galore, they feature displays from artist around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whaledaker
50,Check out the American Museum of Ceramic Art!,"This museum is truly unique and a real must-see for ceramics lovers. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The exhibits change and new artists are featured periodically. Something different in a museum, so please take the time to go visit when you're in the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/908pamd
50,Just go and expand your mind,The people that work here really love art and do their best to make sure you as a consumer or just a person of interest enjoy everything about your experience here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenChinoHills
50,Amazing and unique museum,We took advantage of the trolley that runs on Pomona's Second Saturday event to visit this museum (amoca). It was very interesting and educational. Some nice ceramics for sale too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbiel449
50,Worth the drive,"Like no other ceramic museum in the country. A mix of historical shows, retail and a massive studio open to the novice and professional. The founder clearly has a passion for the medium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ACprojects
40,Delightful museum,We went there for the Korean ceramics exhibit and were impressed with the quality of the venue. They displayed samples from Master ceramic artists based in Icheon which apparently was the first of its kind in the US. Friendly staff. Delightful gift store. We bought a few Icheon made ceramics for family. A little gem in Pomona.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epigeek
50,The Clay Connection,Works by Jim and Nan McKinnell as evidence of their active role in the field of ceramic art as leading American potters. Show includes works of other influential mid-twentieth artists/teachers from their personal collection. AMOCA is building a permanent collection of ceramic art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMc818
30,"Small, but interesting","There is a nice collection, but it is limited in size and when we visited there was not a lot of variety. I would recommend you wait for the free days to check it out. The gift shop is great with an excellent select.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecarfamily
40,Interesting Ceramic Museum,"Interesting museum of ceramics. Showing British ceramics when I visited. Has studios for potters. Also interesting exhibit of German ceramics, a lot of steins.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CWB878
40,Very nice museum,I've been there three times - twice as part of an event and once just with my wife. I would take a visiting friend if they were interested too.Nice ceramics museum and artists studios too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sffan2
40,They will fire your ceramics for you,Interesting setting in an old bank. Interesting unique items in the gift shop. Turned in some ceramic tiles for firing. Very helpful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dashdashdashdash
50,Fantantic museum!,This is one of the best museums in Southern California. It's not big but the exhibitions could rival the best anywhere. There are also artist studios inside the museum that offers workshops. Friendly and cozy environment. I love this place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lv2goplaces
50,A TRUE GEM IN POMONA,"If you like to see the work of true artisans, this is for you. The ceramics ranged from exquisite classic work to whimsical avant gard. There is also a gorgeous mural by California artist, Millard Sheets. We were there for about an hour, a few weeks ago, and I am still thinking about some of the amazing pieces I saw.The art is well placed and easy to get around. Well worth the trip!This museum is located in downtown Pomona and is convenient to some good restaurants and lots of antique stores, so you can really make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbgirlLA
