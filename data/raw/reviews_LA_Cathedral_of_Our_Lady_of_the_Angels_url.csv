50,Modern Cathedral with a lot to see!,"This is a modern church with a lot to see. After you park in the parking lot (which costs $10, and I didn’t see any other parking around the area), you exit the garage and enter the Cathedral outside area which is very large. You could spend quite some time just walking around the outside. There are three fountains, some small garden areas with statues in one of the areas, an area dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, and a glass overview area of the freeway. There is also a café and a gift shop. The inside of the Cathedral is modern, but, of course, it is huge, again with a lot to see. There are quite a few pop out areas with paintings, statues and in one pop out some relics from Saints. The Cathedral also contains a beautiful gold ornamental framework with statues and a very pretty 19th Century Presepio (Nativity Scene). While this Cathedral is certainly not similar to the ones in Europe, it is definitely worth a visit.",tinaNtravel
50,Pleasantly surprised by its modernism,"Not knowing what style we’d see, traditional or otherwise, it was great to visit this marvellous modern place of worship. In front is a fine array of carillon bells. Above the bronze doors a figure of Our Lady has outstretched arms of welcome to all.Inside is expansive with a magnificent vista along the nave. Light filled with suspended illuminations, it is inspiring. Numerous art works adorn the space. A fine painting portrays life in 18th century California.An impressive mausoleum is at basement level. Tranquillity reigned amongst the numerous plaques for the dearly departed in their final place of repose.",permia
50,Awe inspiring cathedral,"This is a very modern cathedral but also still a cathedral. The tapestries of saints on either side of the sanctuary are incredibly humbling when you consider the long history of the church. The cathedral does not have the best acoustics, so you will want to sit near the front if attending Mass and make sure to arrive early to get parking.",Geoff P
50,Religious art,"It's hard to love the exterior, but it's a completely different matter inside.Not only does it have real atmosphere - a serene calm - but it is full of interesting (if unchallenging) religious art: tapestries showing saints looking like real people; another of the baptism of Christ.I didn't attend a service, but still enjoyed lingering and soaking up the atmosphere.",PhilKennedy
50,A Surprising Gem,"The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is a modern gem, which must be experienced to be appreciated. Unimpressive from the outside, the interior is surprisingly expansive and uplifting. The tapestries depicting the Communion of Saints are largely based on living models. Artwork from a range of eras may be found around the side altars. Bellissimo!",EugenioSalandra

50,Luscious experience,"This modern rendition of a Catholic church might disappoint a few because, well, because it's ""modern."" I spend as much vacation time in Italy as I can, prowling Catholic churches that are hundreds, even thousands of years old. This is not that, but what it is, pleases. The space is gorgeous, with side chapels everywhere for quiet reflection and praying. Now and again, there's a concert. Not a lot of advertising, but they do happen. For all of his failings - and they are many - Roger Mahoney did a good thing.",LATraveller77

50,Modern and beautiful,"This was built in the early 2000's and is a modern cathedral. The architecture is interesting, the statue over the entrance doors is lovely, the tapestry/frescoes are very evococative, the light through the alabaster windows is pretty. It is unique ""inside out"" with the chapels outside the sanctuary.",cookpias
50,"Beautiful cathedral for faith, architecture and art.","Since this cathedral in downtown Los Angeles opened in 2002, after much cantankerous discourse among parishioners and diocesan staff (including the Cardinal at the time), I try to visit every time I'm in the Los Angeles area - and I'm glad that Cardinal Mahoney and the diocese were able to see the vision to fruition! This complex (more than ""just"" a cathedral) is not an old school edifice you'll find in Europe, but if you approach it carefully you will find that it is a world class house of worship in it's own right. It was expensive, but for bringing people into their own spiritual experience, the ability for this complex to bring thousands of people deeper into their faith is, in a real sense, priceless. Carefully is the word I chose, as you need to suspend all and any expectations and just approach your visit as you would a museum, ready to receive whatever artwork, structure, tapestry, etching, furniture, lighting, colors, stained glass, and more you may encounter. It is an amazing place, and as many times as I have visited, I still find new things that catch my interest. It is best to enjoy your visit by not limiting yourself to just the ""church."" There are many other things to see outside of the main sanctuary and nave: side chapels, the chapel for Eucharistic adoration, the mausoleum, the baptistry, the side garden at the campanile, the outdoor patio and sculptures, the shrine to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the glass dedication panels along the freeway side, the fountains, the bell tower along West Temple, the modern pergola leading from the gift shop/cathedral offices to the entrance of the cathedral, and much, MUCH more! The building itself is amazing. Pink colored stone work, and a minimal use of right angles creates a very unusual postmodern style that creates unique and at times stunning views of the building, both inside and outside. Working on a theme of ""Light and Journey,"" the cathedral features extensive use of alabaster windows, which provide much light and no outside views from the nave or sanctuary itself, allowing you to gaze upward into the total experience, much as the cathedrals of old did with their intense heights. The architect is of Spanish background, and may have had such cathedrals in mind. It is also an interesting note that the cathedral is 333 feet in length - just ONE foot longer than the famous St. Patrick's cathedral in New York. No rivalry among cardinals, though! LOL. When you enter from the main door off the plaza, you'll see various side chapels with many displays worth visiting. You'll also find paintings of all 21 California missions, and a large painting depicting the general history of the California indigenous peoples, the Spaniards and the early Friars. There is also a Eucharistic chapel (not easy to find!) which is worth a visit, if not for prayer then for the effect of the architecture again leading your prayers upward. At the end of the hallway you will find the original altar retablo from St. Vibiana's cathedral, damaged in an earthquake and for which this replacement cathedral was built. At the rear of the nave is the granite baptismal pool, with a tapestry (one of many by John Nava) hanging over the baptistry, depicting John the Baptist baptizing Jesus. The nave itself slopes downward, allowing all people (3,000 capacity) to see the sanctuary clearly. The hanging lights, and trumpets (speakers) are beautiful, and the sanctuary itself contains the large bishop's chair (the ""cathedra""), altar and ambo (where readings and gospel are proclaimed) all custom made. The Dobson pipe organ pipes (all 6,019!) stand above the choir. The organ itself contains four keyboards and twelve rows of stops! Not to miss are the ""Communion of Saints"" tapestries on both sides of the nave. John Nava designed these to feature well known saints, all facing the altar. He included everyday people - like you and I - to remind us all of the call to sainthood. Extremely moving the first time I saw these! After visiting the main church, on the other side hallway be sure to see the statue of Joseph and Jesus as a child, and a golden Chapel of the Relic of the Tilda of Saint Juan Diego. Head downstairs to the 6,000 crypt mausoleum. There is the Chapel of St. Vibiana, patron saint of the archdiocese. and her relics. The crypts are amazing to read for the inscriptions, and you will also find past Archbishops and Cardinals, and actor Gregory Peck and his wife interred here. Old stained glass windows (German made) from the St. Vibiana cathedral are scattered about. Afterward exit by the side doors at the mausoleum entrance stairs and visit the cloister garden, walking along the wall toward the cafe and gift shop. Enjoy the views of the campanile, gardens and freeway, and end your visit with a snack or small memento. And be sure to return - you'll see new things, I promise!",Mister-Markie

We went ot Mass at the Catthedral because so many cars were going into their parking. Turns out, it was a Chinese New Year Mass! What an experience!! The music, the Pomp, the Vestments, the incredible Service was an experience never to forger. We saw Uma Thurmond there, an extra treat because she is more beautiful in person. After Mass we toured the Church. The architecture is amazing. Los Angeles iis fortunate to have a structure of this beauty among its treasures!",malibumaven
40,Impressive but sterile cathedral.,"Been to cathedrals in Europe, and this distinctly American cathedral is bland and sterile by comparison.

40,Lovely Catholic Church in L.A.,"Very modern Catholic church in downtown Los Angeles. When I think of Cathedrals, I picture old historic churches in my mind. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels is not what I pictured. Still, it is beautiful.Recommend dropping by if you are in downtown L.A. The church is open for everyone to see.

It is very open and seems to be welcoming parishioners with open arms. The surrounding grounds and garden are beautiful and not to be missed.

They have a 12 noon mass daily and we went on a Monday ... it was really nice and had a warm welcoming feel. As we went to mass parking was free which was a nice perk. We did spend money on lighting candles. Well worth the visit ... I loved the tapestries of the saints throughout the church, a beautiful touch",gina1230

40,It is all about your feeling towards God,"The place itself looks ugly from outside. And only when you enter the Cathedral, you can feel the true meaning of pure love by God. The Cathedral is very simple in its architecture, pure, it does not disturb your thoughts and dialogue with God. It also gives you this feeling of being just a little piece of the world which embraces you. It is a safe heaven. It is full of light. It gives you promieses... And down in the basement it has a little columbarium. You will see the rest place of Gregory Peck among others.",786malgorzatac

50,"Lovey cathedral, lovely service","We were visiting L.A. and decided to attend Sunday Mass here. We had a great experience! The cathedral itself is certainly untraditional, but it's lovely and no doubt a reflection of the faith community. We especially enjoyed that instead of the stations of the cross, the walls of the knave were decorated with tapestries of famous saints in prayer - it felt like we were going to Mass with them! We were just visitors, but we felt welcome at the cathedral during our short visit!",Rachel_Marie_Be
30,Interesting from outside not so much from the inside,"I had heard great things about the architecture of this Cathedral, so I decided to visit it. It is very modern inside and out.

This was a deeply moving experience that I am glad I did.,60+ Traveler
50,Spiritually and Seismically Safe,"It is an impressive place. We attended the Spanish language Sunday mass on Mother's Day when we were there, and it was spiritually uplifting.

50,Amazing cathedral!,"I visited this cathedral during my trip to Los Angeles back in July 2010. I was really blown away by it. It is quite massive!!! Even though the outside looks a little modern the inside is quite nice. I loved the beauty of tapestries and the organ is really great! I attended mass here which was celebrated by Cardinal Mahony, then Archbishop of Los Angeles. Everyone from the people to the staff to the priests were incredibly nice, and welcoming. Definitely stop here whenever you are visiting the City of Angels!",Andrew M
40,Stark for a Cathedral,"It is a rather un-extraordinary facade, and doesn't exactly stand out in the landscape of the northern downtown LA area. Parking is in the garage below ($10). There is a very large courtyard between the parking garage and the cathedral. Above the garage is the gift shop and the meeting rooms. The doors to the Cathedral are rather impressive as are the tapestries that adorn the wall of the main church. Be sure to visit the chapel below the main church, and take the time to view the various wall hangings. If available, have a docent give you a tour as much of the beauty of the church could easily be overlooked if you didn't understand what it all was and why it is special.",EAWH77

50,Easter Services at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,"We walked to the Cathedral from the Millenium Biltmore down Grand Avenue on Easter Morning. It was a very pleasant walk, past The Broad and The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). The Cathedral is impressive and worth a short visit on any day, but on Easter Morning it was majestic. We arrived a few minutes after services were scheduled to start. It was impressively packed with standing room only, and folks lining the aisles. Yet there was room for three more standing in the rear. Later that morning, we took the Angel's Flight Railway to brunch at the Grand Central Market. Afterward the Railway appeared to be experiencing a delay (it turned out someone wasn't sitting down) and we walked up the stairs to visit the MOCA. We spent several hours at the MOCA and had a modest lunch at the cafe there before leaving. When we emerged we observed that there were long lines to get in. Across the street, the Broad still had long lines as it had early in the morning. We walked back to our hotel having had a very enjoyable morning and afternoon.",David W

There are a couple of old items on display. And the mausoleum is interesting. Parking is expensive, I wonder if it benefits the church? Which would be good of course. It kind of looks like the church might be feeding the homeless as they are camping nearby.",Bhodie Bob

40,Massive Modern Cathedral in the Central City,"The Cathedral is kind of isolated being squeezed on the north by the Hollywood Freeway and the south by the Los Angeles Civic Center. It is a temple of peace and solitude in the middle of busyness. The Cathedral is a little imposing as a large concrete structure and you have to really try to get into the building by entering the gate and going up stairs to the main yard to get to the entrance. Once inside, you can feel the serenity and peace in the understated interior. It is well lit by natural light and is majestic in its spaces. There are many side chapels and rooms that have different altars and inspirational displays. The sanctuary is grand in size and spacious. The organ is powerful and fills the space with melody. Definitely worth the visit to see the architecture and experience the presence of the Lord.",geotech522

Everything: the outside, the entrance (mural-size paintings, the sides (with all the images of saints up there looking towards the altar, the baptismal font at the back portion, St, John the Baptist's image on the entire back wall, the cubicles on the sides, the modern chandelier and lighting fixtures, the altar, the ceiling, gosh! Everything spells a lot of effort to honor God with a contemporary very modern edge. Could not stop gushing as we entered.Then, the mass itself. It left me speechless. We fortunately were there on Father's Day, so there was a special greeting for the Dads who were present. The choir too was superb. I wish I could have stayed on and gone back for more visits to pray. The place is so serene and mid boggling all at the same time.If you are Catholic and in LA, Mass here should be at the top of your list.",TinglOrq
40,Stained glass is awesome.,"Stained glass is awesome. Check out the catacombs and the stained glass mixed into the crypt area. The architecture is brutal, the church calls it contemporary. Just not my tastes. Still, if you are at the Broad museum it is only a short walk away.",Cavydad
50,A Mystical Space In DTLA,"I've been driving by this cathedral whenever I go up to LA and was intrigued by photos I've seen of the place. I'm not religious by any means (I'm atheist in fact), but I enjoy looking at different types of architecture and my curiosity was piqued enough to go see this place for myself. The entrance is like that of an ancient fortress with its carved doorways and imposing edifice and when you go inside it becomes very dark and quiet as echoes bounce through the hallway. Then when you turn to the right, you see this grand room bedecked with murals and lights hanging from above. This maybe a more contemporary structure, but to me the impact it leaves on me is similar to the medieval cathedrals and monasteries of Europe. It inspires quiet meditation and I recommend seeing this beautiful cathedral for yourself even if you aren't Catholic.",Colby S

Breath taking! We saw the most beautiful architecture and the Mausoleum where Gregory Peck and Saint Vibiana is buried...The stained glass windows are so beautiful and the altar is unbelievable. I have been back to Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels many times for mass since this day and do stop in frequently to pray. Love this church.",Paula050314
50,Modern Cathedral,The architecture of the Los Angeles cathedral is modern and if you are used to Gothic or other type of architecture you will find it very different. It is very pretty and has many symbolic christian elements. It is next to a freeway and is also reachable by public transportation,2Cubanas
50,Incredibly beautiful Modern Cathedral! Convenient parking in attached garage! Love the Architecture!!,"We went to 8am mass at the cathedral. It was amazing!

50,Lovely place,"This is my second trip and if I'm ever back in LA I would come again. Usually I'm not one to like modern architecture for churches. This is my only exception. Inspire of the modern lines, the art is inspiring. The ""communion of saints"" is so magnificent. I had no words to describe it to my sister so I just brought her. Highly recommended.",Maria Q
50,Something for EVERYONE!,"This is not your typical Catholic Church, for me it feels like a performing arts venue. However, there are side alcoves that provide private space for meditation. And downstairs are the most beautiful stained glass windows that are original to St Viibiana's Church (formerly the Cathedral). My fav art piece is the beautiful Lady of the Angels that hovers over the doors at the main entrance, by the grand sculptor Robert Graham who left us way too soon, RIP. The gardens especially the playful animal sculptures are delightful. And the restaurant for a quick bite does not disappoint. Plus the gift shop is filled with adorable angels and items that are affordable and well made. My office was across the street and I use to go early and listen to the organist and then walk over to the cafe for a latte. Fond memories!",Cafegirl1

50,Not my cup of tea!,"Much too modern for me. Too many straight lines and the inside is nothing to write home about. I liked the murals on the walls that depict the many stages of the Church throughout the years, and some of the statues were nice but overall I'd rather go to my own church or I think it is called St. Andrews in Pasadena that you can see off the 210 freeway. Now that is a church with character.",Rita D

50,Great if you need to go to church during vacation.,"As a practicing Catholic, I found the Cathedral to be a nice change of scenery for a worship space. The ultra modern architecture is quite a departure from the older Gothic architecture where I currently worship.As a tourist, I felt welcome from both the congregation and clergy. The homily was uplifting and the music was a bit more updated than I'm used to. (While I prefer the classics, the newer music was a nice change of pace.)I will definitely return on my next visit.",KuriousKat2

50,Amazing modern building,We happened to be here during Sunday morning services. Alabaster windows and large tapestries are amazing. Extremely large open courtyard in front with sculpture garden. Be sure to take a look at the performing arts high school just over the highway behind the cathedral. It looks like there's a huge water slide going around this building.,chitownsam

50,Peaceful beauty,"We recently spent a quick getaway night in downtown LA. Our accommodations at the Bonaventure were wonderful and offered us the opportunity to explore the nearby sites on foot.The cathedral is an oasis of calm and tranquility within the busy metropolitan area. We spent about two hours here and enjoyed every minute. The edifice is very modern and has a stark beauty all its own. That subdued exterior was the perfect shell for the wonderful experience inside. The building itself is modern throughout and a marvel of architecture. My overall feeling was like being in a cocoon...at least what I think that would be like. The main body of the church is protected from direct light, has a gently sloping floor and soaring ceilings. Slender walls on both sides angle away from the altar from front to back and offer passage to the side aisles which are at the exterior walls of the church. The tapestries are magnificent and are worth some time to study. Many artifacts from older churches are situated throughout the space adding a touch of history to the modern surroundings. Small chapels and the baptismal font all invite moments of reflection.I must attend a service at this church. I imagine the acoustics are marvelous as well.Enjoy!",Bernie H.

50,A Cathedral for History,"This cathedral was designed and built to last a few hundred years - like the cathedrals of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The tapestries are worth the visit alone in that they are both large and modern and yet reflect ages of tapestry simultaneously. Also go below ground through the ""catacombs"" - as I call them - but more modern speak would be the ""crypts"". One can visit 24x7 and light a candle and say a prayer. There are also interesting sculptures outside and a gift shop. It's wonderful to have a historic building that will last for hundreds of years which is an active catholic church.",Monica H

One group was preparing for a wedding.In one section of the cathedral is prayer room that can accomodate few people at a time.Also, there is a room where relics of Saint John Paul II are displayed.At the lower level is a mausoleum which contains crypts and columbarium niches. Among those buried here are former bishops of Los Angeles and the relics of Saint Vibiana, the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.In my 2-week stay in the United States, I was somewhere else on those two Sundays that I was unable to attend mass at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels.",JeanRocqueRaltique

Went to info desk by the main gate and saw that there was a tour. Kristen was great.

30,Earthy-looking Temple on Temple Street,"This past Saturday, just for a one-time experience, we took our out-of-town visitors to ride the subway from Pershing Square one stop up north to City Hall/Grand Park (partly to avoid the uphill walk incline). Unfortunately, when we got off we found the escalator NOT working and there is no elevator in sight (part of the station blocked off). We had no choice but climb up the steep stairs to exit; not a good impression. Once above ground, the view of City Hall and Grand Park was impressive. We crossed the street to Temple and walked up another incline to reach the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angeles. Much had been written about the design and architecture of this landmark building. I had never been that impressed but as a people’s church, it did project a welcoming and calming ambience as we entered the grounds. The interior is large, uniquely partitioned, unpretentious and quite plain, without any extraordinary display. There was a wedding going on inside so we did not linger long. From this site, we walked towards Grand and began our own walking tour of DTLA (John Ferrar, Music Center, Disney Concert Hall, Broad, MOCA, California Plaza, Angel Flight, Bradbury, Grand Central, etc.)",LnS2004

50,Modern Architecture designed around the Catholic Faith,"From the moment you cast your eyes upon the Cathedral set against a clear blue sky. You cannot deny the scale of this place of worship. On your way to the Cathedral entrance you pass magnificent Gardens deigned around the acts of Faith and Devotion. They are difficult to describe as many aspects of design using modern materials are interwoven into the images being represented here. The hustle and bustle of Los Angeles can barely be heard as you sit and maybe spend a moment of reflection.As you enter the huge doors you are taken along a journey of the Catholic faith in California and the story of The Missions, with each one being represented in individual Paintings along the wall to your left.Through the wall to your right are pasageways leading into the main body of the Cathedral. Without wishing to spoil your own impressions, lets just say look in wonder. The Cathedral itself had to be built to last 500yrs no mean feat in an area known for its earthquakes.Moving on and below the Cathedral, you enter The Mausoleum a huge undertaking stretching the whole size of the foundations. Obviously there is plenty of space available for those wishing to be laid to rest here. There is the Tomb of Gregory Peck and his wife and other noted christians.Back outside there are gift shops and a wonderful Cafe / Restaurant with Rest Room Facilities. The Cathedral also has its own Carpark adjacent to the Gardens.For those of you who are sceptical about religion and its impact on the modern world. Go visit and enjoy the Modern Architecture. It is so impressive in many ways. Hope You Enjoy the place and spend a little time away from the Metropolis that is Los Angele's.",Nigel G

You need about 1 to 2 hours to visit the Cathedral and you can have a great day seeing the other interesting sights of downtown LA.",Vicky H
40,Powerful and humbling,"Not conventionally cathedral-like. One of the criticisms I read, when it first opened, was that it looks like the box cathedrals come in. It is much more than that.

40,A Modern Temple of Worship,"It has been reported that this Catholic church was built at a cost of $1 billion dollars. That alone should strike your fancy. Also, unlike most churches it is extemely modern, so it suggested that you take a docent led tour to better comprehend the conceptual ideas about this edifice.",tennisman2016
40,If You Like Cathedrals You Found One,"The Cathedral is very popular, not so much with the local Catholics, but with people who want to see a grand, expensive, over built, filled with pretense, Church.Here is the thing. This was built with a lot of ""discussion."" Some really could not wait to see it. They waited while the buildings nearby that housed the poor were taken and ground was broken. There were several ceremonies all for the new Cathedral and won't it be so lovely. And the fact is, it is lovely. If you like super cool Catholic Churches you will love it. They have mass just like all other Catholic churches and you are welcome to attend.On the other side were those that thought what a waste of money and displacement for the mostly Catholic, and poor residents. They don't care about the stained glass, they are trying to find food and housing. There were a few protests and the like. The place did cost a lot of money. How that money could have been spent is not for me to tell you.It is beautiful. The outside looks dull, but once you walk in the doors it is great. I stopped by just to attend mass. And frankly, I won't be back--I was on the side of the poor.Enjoy.",elizabethlascheid
50,Don't let the outside fool you!,From the street the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels looks like a gigantic concrete bock structure. If you have visited other cathedral's and were expecting something else; don't let that put you off. The inside combines perfectly modernity and ancient relic.

50,Great place to visit even if you are not religious,"As a local Angeleno, there are some places that really are fun to go with visitors and the Cathedral is one of them. You walk in and see the constellations they have laid out, then the fountain with write ups in different languages. The Cathedral is beautiful and has many antiquities. You should also go down to the area under the Cathedral for interesting art work and Mausoleum. When done, you come out at the back and see more displays and walking through the sand garden, you approach the freeway viewing area. There on the glass wall, you see names of donors and supporters, some of them famous. Children can play in the park area that has additional interesting items. Finally, the cafe for refreshments and the gift store for memorabilia. Overall, a great LA spot.",LenaBalt

50,a moment of silent contemplation,"As Angeleno who lives near metro station and near DTLA, love to stop by and spend some time in silence as well as enjoy the pipe organ. The building is modern but not overwhelming and definitely less oppressive than those Baroque, Renascence cathedrals. During the summer is such a nice place to stop by and get refreshed.

30,Average cathedral,"I wanted to really like this cathedral but it did not create a lot of strong feelings. It is a very bland building that feels like it's trying too hard to be modern and on the edge of architectural design. It has all of the Catholic elements of a cathedral but it is missing a spark or something that overwhelms you when you look at it and you don't want to leave. Its all very beige and somewhat boring. The architect missed an opportunity in creating a feature or installation which will draw you in and want to make you stay and pray or meditate. It's just a big, modern beige building.",Ramadama
20,Better places in Los Angeles to see grand churches,"Not sure how someone actually reviews a church. Especially when it is the headquarters of the Archdiocese for a major religion in one of the largest cities in the world. For me however I guess what bothers me about this place has more to do with architecture than anything else. I am not Catholic, so this does not have any emotional tug in my soul. However when it was announced, as well as when it was being built, and again when it was completed, the Archdiocese itself always presented it as more than just an administration building and church of worship, but also a place, like a museum or concert hall that should be welcome to whomever wants to come no matter what their religious beliefs. So that said I’ve gone there several times, simply as an observer. I actually attended the public opening, as well as several concerts, and once just wandered around during a lunch hour. I purposely went with several friends who came here from overseas or the East Coast, and are practicing Catholics, since I wanted to get their feeling of the place as well. To sum it all up, one of my oldest and dearest friends, whose brother is actually a priest in Massachusetts, was rather silent as she and I visited the various areas, as well as the chapel itself. We then walked outside and cross the street, walking down Temple Boulevard (the irony of the street’s name where this is situated is not lost on most Los Angeleonians), she stopped and turned around to get a good look at the structure from afar, and then said: “my God, it looks like the boxes Disneyland came in”. I thought it was the most brilliant summation of what I feel, as many do, is bothering us about this place. It seems cold, almost institutional, and without any sense of the spiritual soul-searching and cleansing that its religion represents. Not far from there is the new county “Twin Towers” jail. Another friend of mine, also Catholic, who had asked to come and see it, asked me seriously if the same architect did both structures. If you compare them, which you can easily do on Google, you’ll see what he means. For many of us who live in the area, I think we see a major difference between this complex and the city’s new Archdiocese headquarters of the Episcopalian church. It was constructed around the same time as the jCatherdral of Our Lady of the Angels, across the street from the magnificent Echo Park Lake. Great care was given to make the sprawling complex and all the administration buildings, schools and church blend in to the natural surroundings of the park and lake. You can see that a great deal of thought and care was put into every detail. Even the different exterior colors create an almost natural camouflaging so that the complex seems to be a part of nature without ever trying to call attention to itself or give any sense of authority or power. So in comparison many feel that the Catholic complex which juts up from the Hollywood Freeway doesn’t truly represent the religion it houses and administers. Point is, for those visiting Los Angeles, there are so many other wonderful representations of the Catholic church, especially in some of the magnificent old churches especially in and around Olvera Street.",Heywood F
50,A Mystagogical Masterpiece,"This place is appeals to architects, theologians, and people who don't know anything at all. It is very much a post-modern structure, but it still contains all of the ancient elements of authentic Christianity, including the most impressive modern catacomb system I've seen. The architect focused on using light in the structure, so a daytime visit is most appropriate.",bhons21

You can park for free for three hours in the attached parking structure, if you attend Mass at the Cathedral. Exploring the courtyard and cathedral can take a couple of hours.

40,Awe inspiring & serene cathedral in Downtown LA,"Visited this famous Latin Church Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church located on W Temple Street in Downtown Los Angeles on a Friday morning while strolling through the neighbourhood. The imposing Cathedral structure, quite awe inspiring, opened in 2002. The cathedral is named in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the patronal title of Our Lady of the Angels, echoing the full name of the original settlement of Los Angeles. Definitely worth a visit while in Los Angeles.",Arindam G
40,Very... Interesting,"When you are in Europe and want to see a cathedral, usually if you've seen one you've seen them all. Sure there are some amazing outliers, but they are rare and the sameness is usually the point. In this cathedral, the point is the exact opposite: everything is very different from other churches.Even before you enter, you will notice that the building is really non-standard for a cathedral, and they have some sculptures/religious decorations on the outside that are atypical. Inside, everything just solicited a ""what did I just see"" reaction from me. Other than the fact that the church is very different, there isn't anything amazing about it, but just for that uniqueness it's definitely worth a visit if you are in Downtown LA.",Ynhockey
50,Awesome,I have been many times now. This is an amazing structure. Once inside it is truly awesome. It is a beautiful modern version of a classic cathedral and the only one in the city. All elements of a traditional cathedral are here in a breathtaking modern form. The chapels and mausoleum downstairs are lovely as well. The antique stained glass from the previous cathedral are gorgeously displayed downstairs as well. The parking is ample and free on service days. The cafe is nice and the gift store is overflowing with religious gifts traditional and contemporary. Definitely worth a stop in your exploration of downtown.,StaceyQM
30,"No, it's not a large Home Depot; it's a CHURCH!","Yeah, it looks like a Home Depot on the outside. Inside, it's actually sort of nice. Sort of. If you're a fervent believer/pilgrim, it'll probably do. But if you're familiar with any of the great cathedrals of Europe, you have to wonder how the Catholic church has managed to slide this far downhill in only a few centuries. They used to build the greatest edifices on the face of the earth; buildings that were a profound experience for even the most hardened cynic, what with their rapturous beauty and powerful spirituality. Compared to them, well, this is sort of the McDonalds of cathedrals. Pleasant enough, even tasty, in a bland sort of way, but hardly memorable.",ProPhotoLA

40,Not Bad for a new Cathedral,"I was VERY resistant to Cathedral of Our Lady. Just a ton of money spent at a time when I thought...""REally do we need that?"" But having now been there a few times. It is really lovely. I did a self walking tour and enjoyed it. I also sat in church for a moment or two of reflection. The gift shop is fantastic for religious purchases. And I noticed I don't hear the freeway. Not sure why since it buts right up to it. Must be a sound angel protecting it.",TracyHawaii
40,Huge modern Cathedral,"Came here for a Palm Sunday Mass, a surprise that the building was quite different from many cathedral with gothic style.

50,Beautiful - yet modern,We were recommended to visit the cathedral - on a very hot 90deg day in September. Cool and peaceful - beautiful main nave and windows.

30,A box shaped Cathedral?,"We were in this section of LA and wanted to see the cathedral. It certainly is modern, the open courtyard was very nice. The building is not what one would expect, it is certainly modern. God is where the heart is and worshippers were there on this particular Sunday.",Ahems
10,"An architectural monstrosity,","The cathedral, dubbed Taj Mahoney after the disgraced Cardinal who built it, looks like the box some other building was delivered in. Forbidding from the street and bordered on one side by a very busy freeway, this something to miss. Inside of church is cold too, except for tapestry. If you want to see a Catholic Church that has something to do with the life of Los Angeles, go down the hill to Mission Dolores.",Cos39
50,Inspiring,"This was my second visit to the Cathedral and it was as amazing as I remembered. This was a very controversial project because of the modern, non-traditional style. I think the architect and designers achieved the goal of making this a cathedral for the people, all people. One does not have to be Catholic, or even religious to be moved and welcomed in this place. It is incredible and can be life-changing.",msc196
50,Beautiful!,"We attended Sunday mass here while visiting the area. The mass was very nice. Great music, meaningful sermon and reflective time.The building is very modern but still contains so many beautiful pieces of art. The alabaster windows, the tapestries hanging on the walls, the marble and wood of the alter furniture, pictures, carvings, etc. All beautiful. My favorite sculpture was of Jesus and Joseph. The look at Joseph's face shows his love for his son.Be sure to walk onto the alter and see the chairs and alter table up close. Also be sure to go downstairs to see the burial places. The only name I recognized was Gregory Peck but still interesting to see.",MJVT57

Open to the public and free it's very wheelchair accessible (elevators and ramps everywhere), has a beautiful courtyard and sculpture garden which is especially nice for good weather days, and also has a small cafe and Catholic bookshop. It is walking distance to the metro but also easy to park as it has its own dedicated and attached parking garage.",wienerwoman

There is also a great gift shop, café, bronze statue garden kids could play in, and also tall glass windows to view out the city and another cool structure across the freeway. Entering the church is just majestic, clean lines, natural atmosphere. There are lots of seating and a very minimalistic modern vibe to the church. The monsignor was very relatable and nothing about this church felt intimidating or a separation from us and the clergy. Very very welcoming! There is also art around the outside of the seating main area as well as a beautiful installation from another church. Must see! Also they validate parking if you attend mass & they will do so after that.",mcseven

50,Inspiring,"The exterior of the cathedral belies its interior. It is stunningly beautiful. The last time that I was in such a beautiful place of worship was the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.In contrast, Rafael Moneos minimalism gives a feeling of restfulness and peace. One feels so tiny among the cavernous, light filled space, it's like being in a canyon. Of special note are the sconces with bronze angels and realistic faces, and the beautiful tapestries that grace the sides, very moving.It was the afternoon of New Years Eve, a mass was in session, some carols were sung, it just made the experience more magical.",Afazad

Enjoy. ...,David B L
50,Magnificant and ethereal!,"I took a tour of some of the churches in Los Angeles and we were brought to the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. As it turned out, the artist who created the angels at the base of the alter of the Cathedral was on the tour with us! She told us that the angels she created were made from gold bullion and that the alter itself is the world's largest ruby. When we first pulled up to the Cathedral the first thing we all seen was the beautiful ""floating"" Madonna with the golden halo. Please look closely at her, because she is definitely unique, as she was modeled after a Native American, Mexican and African girl, wearing Jewish clothing. As we walked into the magnificent Cathedral I noticed the extremely large, beautifully carved doors. As everyone else just walked past these beautiful doors, I took the time to really look at them and discovered that each door tells a story. Walking into the Cathedral, past the vestibule into the main part of the church I had seen the huge pipes for the pipe organ! Oh my, do they make wonderful music, and we were fortunate enough to have an organist give us a 20 minute concert! That was a wonderful and unexpected treat! Come in, sit down, look around and listen. The large window behind the alter looks like stained glass, but it's not! It's alabaster! And when the sun comes through this window, it is indescribable. Look closely at the alter, it may look like red granite, but as I stated, the artist to us that it is a very large ruby. This ruby was carved in, and shipped from, Turkey and was donated to the church. Be sure to check out each of the light scones by the alter because each one is unique! And when you are sitting looking in the church, you may notice things others miss. Just as I noticed a naturally formed cross in the marble that no one else noticed until I pointed it out to them. When you are done looking around inside the church, walk the courtyard. You may be lucky enough to hear the bells, which had such an amazing and haunting sound to them. You can even check out the gift shop and maybe find yourself a little something. You will want to spend at least an hour or 2 here, and depending on your mood, perhaps a little longer.",charlottesl
40,Surprising,Wow! We have been visiting religious buildings accross the world and this cathedral's architecture really surprised us. It is difficult to say if you like it or not but it is surely one of the most original religious design we have seen in America.,mpmessier
50,Inspiring Architecture,"The Cathedral is built not only as a monument for the Catholic community of Los Angeles, but for all peoples as the cornerstone relates quoting the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah. It is inspiring to see how a world famous architect interprets the classical cathedrals of Europe for the 21st Century. The building suggests in the asymmetrical shaping of the walls that the transcendent is beyond the scope of human geometry. The variations in light that flood through the Alabaster windows also suggest the multiple and variable characteristics of the Divinity.",Norman A
40,Modern worshipping,"Very modern architecture. At the time of our visit there was a concert practice taking place. Only after listening to beautiful voices and the orchestra, did we learn that the conductor was none other than PLACIDO DOMINGO !!

Easy access - we just ""hopped off"" one of the ""Dash B"" metro link buses.",Sandy W
50,A Site to Behold!,"Whether you a Catholic or not, any visit to LA demands you visit this architectural gem. It is truly a site to behold. Relying on the basic architectural shapes and colors of the Spanish missions, the new Cathedral (12 years old) soars above the street level entrances with a modern architectural flair that is amazing to see outside and in. Every detail of the inside steals from tradition and transforms the church into a 21st Century house of worship that for this century equals the beauty of the great gothic cathedrals. Special note goes to the paintings on the side walls that tell the story of the Church in the new world to the present. Even pictures do not capture the beauty and grandeur of this architectural gem. Why LA hides it,. I don't know. It is a block from Disney Hall and with the other modern public buildings on this multi-block ""square"" its worth many hours to visit.",Jimgo

The walls inside are angled and the ceiling is glass and wood. The murals on the walls are muted and beautiful. The lighting is very cool for a cathedral. Not what you'd expect.

The patio is open and you get to relax and sit and if the cafe and gift shop are open, you can shop and get a bite (we arrived when these places were closed).The large nativity scene, I believe, is imported from Italy. Beautiful to behold!The Cathedral is open and you can wander in and see the beautiful poinsettias and altar decorations. The Cathedral is modern and you are free to wander through the sanctuary and admire the paintings of past saints recognized in the Catholic Church.Make sure you go downstairs and visit the crypts where a lot of famous people are buried.",SacMax
30,"Uninspired, Cold and Unwelcoming vibe..","Looks like an office building--Few entrances to the large courtyard.Modern architecture does not have to lack energy and beauty---Our Lady of Angels lacks beauty and energy.Large courtyard almost totally barren of trees, shade and benches--Almost as if they wanted to discourage sitting,contemplating and enjoying our CathedralInside is cold and sterile--almost devoid of life and energy even though there are plenty of touristsToo bad they spent so much money (250m+) on such an uninviting place.Worth a visit if downtown, but not as a primary reason for being downtown.",Summerasalifestyle

50,Modern surprise,"Prior to our visit, we expected to see an example of the old-world gothic cathedral one would seemingly expect. WOW, what a surprise! This is a modern structure as far removed from my expectations as it could possibly be. They were shooting some sort of prduction on the altar (added interest) but, that did not deter or interfer with our self-guided exploration. Especially intriged by the vast mausalium underneath. In a way, I was a little dissappointed by the arcetecture as it related to my expectations but, was indeed a worthwhile visit that I would highly recommend",AJK810

40,Incomparable tapestries,"There are only two reasons to visit this cathedral: spiritual reasons and to see the magnificent tapestries. Otherwise, the cathedral is a very large, modern building with nothing particular to attract visitors.The 34 tapestries are the largest in America. They are all hand woven, made ""to last 500 years,"" as a local authority explained to us. What makes them particularly fascinating is that they feature various saints and the faithful, all with the faces of real people in Los Angeles. In addition, they were woven to deliberately look dated, and the effect is magical.When you stare at the faces, you are looking at real life, which makes the saints all the more real. It was truly worth a half hour diversion from our busy itinerary in LA.",Anthony-Susan

The location of the Cathedral is on a very high plateau easily accesible from throughout Los Angeles.The Cathedral will endure and welcome the faithful for many generations to come.

50,"Inside, this cathedral is truly inspiring, just beautiful!","Do not be misled by the external appearance of this amazing building, which does not resemble any religious building I have ever visited, from an external point of view. The entrance courtyard and grounds are interesting enough, with the bells in the wall, fountain and children's garden. The inside, however, is a real inspiration, with so much to see and admire, the tapestries and stonework, the organ, the extensive mausoleum downstairs.The cathedral is built of sandstone, which provides a soft and welcoming appearance in itself, but there are many detailed features throughout which need to be studied. A guide is to be recommended, as you can easily miss so much otherwise. The shop is well stocked and also very much worth a visit.",AlbertSolihull
50,Just amazing,"The architecture of this Cathedral is awesome. The stained glass Angels carved on the walls is very beautiful.

50,Breathtaking-I visited twice!,"I visited because it was recommended by our tour escort and it was within walking distance of our hotel. The windows are made from thin sheets of alabaster rather than glass which creates a lovely warm glow on the interior meant to resemble the interior of mission churches of the area. The most spectacular feature, however, is the modern tapestries of the Communion of Saints along both walls of the nave and behind the baptismal font. Absolutely breathtaking,",Annie0809
50,"Amazing Cathedral, a must-see in down-town LA",You have to see this amazing place of worship in LA. I think it is truly an architectural and spiritual wonder. I found it very peaceful and serene. I attended noon hour mass and was delighted to hear the incredible pipe organ. The interior is admittedly more beautiful than than the perhaps more severe exterior design. I was just so taken by the interior of the church. They have done an amazing job making a huge church feel more intimate than you would expect.

I was taking some guests to see the music center and we walked across the street to see the new cathedral, which is a stunning building, very modern with no a lick of stained glass. I think it is beautiful, but if you are into a more traditional look, you may not like it. Well, the organ rehearsal was one of these experiences that you just can't prepare yourself for; big sound, full of grace, gorgeous. And then we went down to use the bathrooms and found the burial crypt - I think that's what it's called - where you can be buried if you can afford it. Pretty amazing, all in all.",Carol B

The Catholic cathedral of Los Angeles, I believe, will gain in stature and recognition as the decades and centuries pass. In LA it is very unusual to build for the millenia. Come see this marvelous work of man and enjoy it regardless of your feelings about churches or Catholisism.",DrKeithEvan
50,a church worthy of the Angels,"I've been wanting to see this cathedral since it was built a decade ago, but hadn't gotten the chance until recently. I attended the 12:30 pm Spanish-language Mass on Sunday--the assembly was substantial, but the church is big enough to hold many many more than attended that day. the interior is more compelling than the exterior; the lighting is interesting, and the long tapestry of saints is a great work of art. the organ is impressive, but the sanctuary seems too large, unfocused...I do not mind the modernist elements of the architecture; they use the light especially well, which is appropriate for a church of any style. there is a certain majesty to the size and spaciousness. I don't especially like the riveted stone panels on the interior and exterior walls--they make the place look unfinished, or worse, vandalized, like an old Roman public building. but that's a minor element. the facilities, the gift shop, all are nice and well placed. the interior court with its majestic palms and entrance paseo, as well as the lovely garden spaces, all are inviting. most important of all, it is a place very conducive to prayer and worship.",John M

40,Worth the visit,"To be honest, I did not liked very much the outside view of the Cathedral, when I saw it during a sightseeing bus tour. As we were hosted at a hotel on downtown Los Angeles (Millenium Biltmore), we walked next day (not very distant) to there, to see the inside of the Church. And that was a good idea.The Cathedral is huge and beautiful. Very nice panels (think are tapestrys), large space, very silent and calm ambience, good place to pray and contemplate.There is too a good shop near the temple (not very cheap, not very expensive), where you can buy medals, catholic stuff, souvenirs, and so on.",slowr

We went on a weekday afternoon and the serene, calm atmosphere allowed us to relax, pray and admire the beautiful surroundings both inside and out of the cathedral.The only downside was having to pay for parking, and it was expensive.

Traffic was light and we parked for free in the nearby garage so we had no trouble getting there. The church and surrounding grounds, including gardens are absolutely beautiful. Plan to arrive early or stay after Mass to enjoy the spectacular scenery both inside and outside of the church. The Mass and music were very uplifting and the priest and parishoners made us feel very warmly welcome. We also visited the Cathedral Gift Shop which has many affordable items. This was definitely one of the highlights of our vacation.",Lisa W
50,Wow....,The first impression as we came out of the parking garage to see a courtyard with tables and umbrellas with people sitting around and eating. The front of the cathedral was breathtaking. We went with my brother-law who is a Priest in the diocese so we had a built in tour guide. The front doors are enourmous we didn't even realize they were the outside doors as they looked like stone walls. We were impressed with the tapestries inside the church. All the saints were facing towards the alter. We looked at the displays that were throughout the cathedral. We went down to the Mausoleum. The stained glass was simply beautiful. It was so interesting to walk throughout tha Mausoleum and look at the stonework and the interesting items down there.The gift shop had all sorts of great religious items making it a perfect place to get that much needed gift. It was a great and moving experience to view this modern archetectual cathedral up close and we had a nice time while we were there. This Cathedral is not like the one in NH that is for sure.,Redwing227
20,They Call this a Cathedral?,"I was shocked by how pagan and disturbing this place looks, when it is supposed to be a Catholic cathedral of a very large diocese! Nevertheless, I would recommend visiting this place because you can view a beautiful historic altar in the back of the church, and the relics of St. Vibiana are kept below the main church for veneration. Other than that, this is unfortunately the ugliest cathedral I've ever visited.",Melanie L
50,A Spiritual Thriller,"Putting aside your religious affiliation or non-affiliation, a visit to this Cathedral is an LA must see. The space, the decor, the colors selected, the hum of the people in the space, all contribute to a spiritual experience. Here you cannot avoid a feeling of respect, reverence, common purpose, expectation, and awe. The architecture has achieved the very goal church architects have strived for since the invention of stone. It is truly humbling. And something has happened to light as it passes from our glorious Los Angeles days of twilight to illumination of this space. It is transformed. If the same doesn't happen to you, that's ok. You will still remember the feeling of being encapsulated in this monument to a modern construct of a house of worship.And one final thing: go to the basement.",Richard R

Inside the building is all odd angles - not a right angle in sight - and uses a wonderful array of natural materials, including stone walls, marble floors, cherry wood seating and alabaster covering all the windows. You approach it through an open courtyard (with its own restaurant and gift shop!) and, this being LA, the mass times are on the same notice board as parking charges. It's also across the freeway from a new high school building which has a visually striking tower that looks like a helter skelter and you get a good view from the cathedral courtyard. Evidently it was controversial when it opened, but it really is worth a look.",Susan8552

A lovely surprise, and the alabaster 'windows' were beautiful.",sarahskinn

My first daughter was baptized here 3 years ago and it was a beautiful service. Moreover, the class and interaction we had with the staff and Priest in preparation for the baptism were the best I've ever attended. This church is friendly, inclusive and beautiful. As masses go they are great and I've always enjoyed the silence that it offers in between services for reflection and just some alone time.

10,Ugliest church in the world,Everything from the horrid construction concrete to the statue of Our Lady over the door that looked like it was designed by the Nazis was just the beginning of an experience that left me angry. Even the lighting fixures are horrendous. Much has been made of the tapestries. Thank God there was SOMETHING to cover the walls. I have seen grocery stores in southern California that are more aesthetically pleasing than this scary warehouse. The best thing that could happen to this monstrosity is a wrecking ball.,joemorrow2801
30,An Impressive Space,"I found the monochromatic interior space to be cold, almost ""industrial"" in feel. The walls have a poured concrete look to them — each large panel has a drilled hole in it.The tapestries are beautiful, but they have a faded, monochromatic look that blends into the walls, relieved only by bronze, trumpet-shaped lighting. (Actually, I was reminded of an Egyptian pyramid because of the ""sideways"" figures on the wall.) The opaque alabaster windows adds to the overall dullness.Ironically, the mausoleum is prettier than the sanctuary. Why were the stained glass windows installed to the basement, where they must be illuminated by artificial light? Also, not everything is as it appears. A friend knocked on one of the niches and discovered that they are metal painted to look like marble. (Fortunately, no one knocked back.)Much has been made about the bronze doors. I've been twice now, and both times the people with me commented on the Pagan elements on those doors. The general consensus was that the statue of the Virgin Mary overhead looked like a young man. I read later that this was to convey strength as opposed to the usual ""meek and mild"" version.I was left with this question: What is a cathedral is supposed to be? Is it supposed to be warm, comforting, spiritual? It wasn't to me or the Roman Catholic, Christian or agnostic friends I was with. My Catholic friends noted the lack of a sanctuary light on the altar and the stations of the cross on the walls. To them, and to me, it felt like a community building — not a sacred space.Then again, perhaps cathedrals are supposed to be mostly ceremonial places, with warmth, comfort and spiritual growth left to the smaller parish churches?The answer lies in the eye of the beholder, I'm sure.I think people who enjoy modern art and are looking for a 21st century architectural interpretation of a cathedral will certainly find it here.",PWestcomm
50,Modern With Soft Traditional Touches,"We are visiting from Houston, where our own diocese has just opened a very traditional cathedral. We attended mass for the feast of the Assumption of Mary today and my husband and I both loved the Los Angeles Cathedral. The complex is very inviting, with convenient parking, where they validated our ticket for the first 90 minutes (after that, parking is very expensive; we paid $10.50 for staying about 45 extra minutes). As you come out of the garage, there is a plaza with a gift shop and grill and lunch tables covered by umbrellas. The cathedral is very modern in design with monochromatic coloring and rough stone walls and you might think it would be cold and hard. However, throughout the surrounding hallways are niches that contain some very traditional elements such as a gorgeous old altar retablo from an old (Mexican? or mission?) seminary church with candles to light and smaller devotional spaces containing art such as an old traditional statue of Mary. Some of the niches are empty and some are used for important displays such as photo exhibit from Catholic Relief Services about the situation in the Sudan. In the Adoration Chapel there is a small but stunning piece that serves as the pedestal for the ornate gold monstrance holding the Blessed Sacrament. The ""cold"" stone walls are covered by the very soft element of massive woven tapestries (very evocative of ancient cathedrals) depicting saints of every period and ethnicity in church history, all facing toward the altar. This is where I disagree with the poster who misses a large shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe. We care about her in Texas, too. The tapestries of the full communion of saints include Juan Diego and many saints representing devotions of Catholics of every faith tradition. La Virgin and Juan Diego are there on the massive bronze doors at the entrance. I completely disagree about the crucifix. This is a very modern piece that also honors the Hispanic tradition of the realistic tortured crucifix. In this dark metal sculpture, Jesus's body is beaten and torn to shreds. I stood in a long line of people waiting to reverence the crucifix after mass and this middle-aged white lady raised by uptight northern-European nuns was not embarrassed to kiss Jesus's feet with all the Mexican-American families and Phillipina ladies. When you get up close to that crucifix, it will bring you to tears. There are small ceramic Stations of the Cross downstairs, but I do agree that the Stations are so important in Catholic spirituality that they should be represented in a more dramatic way upstairs, perhaps in those niches somehow. I also missed a piece of ""resurrection"" art, which could be incorporated with Stations. Overall, thanks very much to all of you who sacrificed to build this space. We would have gone to mass anyway, but the cathedral made it a significant part of our three-day visit to SoCal.",DebbyTravels

The inside of the church is just as bad as the outside, bland and boring. The entire structure looks like it was made out of 4' x 8' sheets of plywood.

50,Magnificent,"One of the most well known tourist attractions in Los Angeles is the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels. This cathedral is the ‘Mother Church’ for the archdiocese of Los Angeles. A Mother Church is the church where the Bishop or the Archbishop seats and presides over. This cathedral is the symbol of the pastoral authority over the Diocese, and a sign of unity among the believers. These are shown as over 1.5 million people have visited the cathedral since it opened its doors in September, 2002This cathedral was preceded by St. Vibiana’s Cathedral, which was built in 1876. After St. Vibiana’s Cathedral was deemed condemned in 1996, the archdiocese was at a loss for a cathedral. Although at first the Archdiocese wanted to build the new cathedral at the same location, but the lawsuits and the protesters made them change their minds. On September 14 1996, the Archdiocese bought 5.2 acres of land for a little over ten million. Construction began in October 1998, and ended in September, 2002. The project cost 163 million dollars, and the end result was a jewel in architecture, churches, and prayerPS:what a magnificent structure!

A ""petit"" replica of the Crucified Christ on the Altar depicting broken flesh or sores all over his deformed body; the ugliest replica of Our Lord, I've ever seen - Also an empty Altar with no Tabernacle? Give me a break.... In the back facing the Altar, there is a small ""unsanitary"" baptismal pool ( approximately 5 x 4 feet) where barefooted parents and god parents enter as the deacon dips the baby into the "" unhealthful dirty water""... What if the barefooted has psoriasis or some other disease ?And the Cardinal eliminated EL VIA CRUSIS, The Stations of the Cross, for gigantic Socialist Peasantry Drapes ?In Latin America and all Catholic Countries, the Stations of the Cross is a popular devotion used by individuals or groups who wish through prayer and reflection to follow Jesus Christ on his way to Calvary.Sorry Cardinal Mahony, as a devout Catholic I cannot practice my devotion in this Cathedral, which to me, is like a Pagan Museum.Arturo Hassan",Expedition5025

I was literally moved to tears.",Pam F
50,Incredible and Surprizing,"What a pleasant surprize! I had been unimpressed by the exterior angle of the new Cathedral I was able to see from the street corner as I passed by on my drive home. I had been in the original Cathedral on the site many times with my devout Roman Catholic grandparents as a child, and was not expecting to like this new replacement on my recent first visit. Now I find the ergonomic use of the site quite fabulous. I cannot wait to return for a formal mass. While I was there, a visiting choir performed outside on the terrace steps and in the church, just lovely.From the well designed and convenient parking, all wheelchair accessible, to the fabulous terrace, with a very nice gift shop and gourmet grill, and then into the cathedral, well, I have just never seen anything like it. The planning and thought, artistic care in every aspect of the new cathedral are beyond anything I could have imagined.The exterior comforts just enhance the experience. Some of the treasures of the former cathedral have been beautifully preserved, and alcoves around the main body of the church hold and beautifully showcase travelling exhibits of religious art and so on. The church organ, the modern tapestry, the simple yet imposing altar, all are a treat for the senses!In the church proper, one's breath is taken away by the simplicity and openness, yet very complex modern space. Beautiful, commissioned functional artwork abounds at every turn, but why should this surprize me, that is what stained glass windows are, functional art.What a place to worship! It was designed with alabaster windows filtering ample light naturally. The feeling is very grand, and beautiful, yet welcoming, even comfortable. This is an ediface that brings to mind the great structures of Rome and Greece, intended to be enduring, yet inspiring, but ultimately useable public spaces. If you like architecture and art, or churches and great city palazzos like those found in Europe, I would place this on the ""do not miss"" list with the Getty Museam.A slight side trip are the sculpture garden and the masoleum! Attend a mass if you can, but plan to linger, perhaps take in a light meal, shop for art at the gift shop where I saw the most beautiful large Lladro Madonna on display, not inexpensive, but less than I have seen for much lesser pieces. Afterwards, a traveller could take in nearby Olvera Street, then on to the Walt Disney Concert Hall or the Music Center and Dorothy Chandler Pavillion, literally across the street!

It may have been nice for a while but it will never stand the test of time. They spent 163 million dollars trying to be different, and different it is. But different doesn't always mean it's better. The Business School at Loyola Marymount University has the same block and nails design. It's not a bad look for a Business School, but a Church? You really get the feeling you are in a Christian (non-Catholic) Church when you are inside. That is not any against non-Catholics, but it should feel like a Catholic Church.
