50,Stark Spirits Tour,"My wife surprised me with a tour of the fab Stark Spirits Distillery. My brother and sister-in-law came along and we were given a meticulous summary of everything that went into the labor of love that is any one of the fine Stark spirits on offer. We then sampled every one of the ten offerings, none of which were the same. The aromatics in the gin were unlike anything I've had before and all of the tastings were a journey to new approaches to the making of true water of life.",nsieling
50,Great tour.. love karen and greg,Best gin whiskeys and omg the Expresso.... contact me hcord so much fun .... karen is great.. greg is fabulous,nancy f
50,Great Spirits!,Karen is so knowledgeable and really has a passion for what Stark Spirits makes. She shared a great story and the process that happens while making their spirits. My family and I really enjoyed the Skyline Gin and Espresso liquor. I would recommend checking this place out while visiting or hanging around Pasadena!,Greg Rageth
50,Stark Distillery,"Fantastic experience! Karen and Greg are so very friendly and knowledgeable! Their product is amazing, and the story of the process is as well. Highly recommend!",Carrie Holler
50,Distillery tour and tasting,Karen and Greg Stark take you on a very informative tour if their small operation. Karen explains the distilling process of various products from gin to rum to whisky to bourbon. Then you get to savor and enjoy their products which are absolutely wonderful. All products are very smooth and enjoyable to your pallet. You will be entertained as well because the Starks are very interesting couple with wonderful stories to share.,Julie Hecht
50,Fun Little Place,"We had a private tasting and tour. Great education, tasty spirits. We tasted whiskeys, gin, aquavit (which is suprisingly tasty) and rum. Small, but great!",Mary D
50,Hidden Gem,"My husband sampled Stark at a local liquor store. I was intrigued when I found out they were local. We toured today and were thoroughly captivated by Karen. It is a small operation but the tale is in the care and devotion to a quality product. We have toured other distilleries, but I gained a greater appreciation of the hard work that goes into a quality product. I am not sure which spirit we liked best. The gin and the aquavit are delicious. The peaty California Scotch is robust and flavorful. The dark rum is a good as anything we have tasted in the Caribbean. Well worth the time to visit.",Sauertea
50,A lifetime memory,"Went to see Greg and Karen last Saturday for some suggestions on what whiskey our friend might enjoy and was introduced to a whole new world! As a novice wine collector who has traveled the world; I never could have imagined such a resource existed in my own backyard. We were treated to no less than 9 different spirits (all handcrafted on site) that went far beyond whiskey. First we tried the different rums, then the gins, and finally the whiskies. The 151 proof rum impressed me the most. It didn't have an ethanol odor but was almost sweet to the nose. Better yet, it tasted great straight and was the only 151 I have ever enjoyed that way. Greg and Karen's passion for the craft was infectious and I am now planning to arrange my own group to visit them again soon.",Kevin C 626
50,Must visit when in Pasadena,"Stark Distillery is a must visit when you are in Pasadena! Greg and Karen were very delightful people to chat with about the spirits (gin, rum, and whiskey). Greg is very knowledgeable about the distillation process (from the raw ingredients, to barrel aging and bottling), He answered all of my questions during the tour (first whiskey tour for me...yeah - had lots of questions - haha). This duo gave a very informative tour and tastings. :) Until I met Greg and Karen, I didn't know it's possible to mix different styles of rum, and how exciting the gin and whiskey would pair with various types of foods. We talked about the different spices being used in the spirits during the tasting, I was able to identify some of the ingredients and started to think how I could use this experience and share it with friends at the next dinner party. I've hosted wine pairings before, and now with the discovery of Stark - I can't wait to host a spirits pairing. I have begun to share this newly discovered gem with friends and started talking about scheduling a group tour soon. Of course, my favorite from the tasting is the peated single malt whiskey. See you soon Greg and Karen. Cheers! :)",NorthStar43888995394
50,In good company and great spirits!,"Our friends invited us on a double date to go on a tour of Stark Spirits. I had never heard of a microdistillery, so I was pretty excited. I am typically not a spirits drinker, but I was excited to see how the process works and enjoy a night out with friends.Greg and Karen, the owners of Stark Spirits, are wonderful people. Karen gave us the tour while Greg was working. Karen started the tour by asking a little about us. I appreciate that she wanted to make the experience personal. It was also a really great way to learn about our friends- very seldom do you hear a friend sum up their life in a few sentences!It was fun to see Greg in action on all of the equipment while Karen was telling us about the process. They are both very knowledgeable, and made it very easy to ask questions during the tour. The tour was both informative and very interesting- they even tailored what they told us based off of what we knew. We are all chemists and scientists- so they added a lot of extra information for us, which was such a personal touch. I appreciate that it didn't feel like Karen was reading off of a script. Of course she described the process in order, but she sprinkled in fun stories about the trials and tribulations of starting a microdistillery and it felt more like a conversation than her talking at us.After the tour, we did the tasting. I didn't expect to like most of them (like I said, I am not a huge spirits drinker), but I was BLOWN away by how phenomenal their drinks were. Their gin was is so good straight it almost would be a disservice to mix it with something (except that probably also would be amazing! Really there is no way to go wrong with the gin.) I also have never liked whiskey (EVER) and I LOVED theirs. My husband even said that the whiskey surpassed his favorite whiskey from Texas and would be buying theirs instead now. I really cannot impress how excellent their craft is. If you can't make it out for a tour, go buy some of their single malt whiskey or the Sunshine orange brandy.The entire night was filled with laughter and fun. At the end of the night it felt like Karen and Greg were friends rather than strangers who gave us a tour.Tl;DR: Go to Stark Spirits for a tour! I recommend making it a double date, their space is relatively small and 4 people was the perfect number. They made a whiskey lover out of someone who hated whiskey before.",Excursion42490923641
50,Fun thing to do in Pasadena,It was an exciting and informative trip to learn all the different aspects of distillery. It was well worth the time spent and the products are top of the line,Milan R
50,"Excellent Spirits, Unique Experience","We live in the area but had never visited Stark Spirits Distillery. We decided to be tourists for a day and booked a tour with them. This was a surprisingly wonderful experience. This is a tiny, 2 person operation very close to downtown Pasadena. The owners gave us the tour and the tasting. I have never had such an intimate look at how a distillery operates nor have I gotten so much really interesting insight and information from a tour. The owners are delightful and the tastings were wonderful. I highly recommend this tour and we will be taking guests here from now on. This was a great find!",Pamela F
50,Stark Spirits: A Micro-Distillery Tour & Tasting,"We had the opportunity to join the Pacific Taste series in a special satellite edition to visit Stark Spirits Distillery in Pasadena, CA. It was well organized and we had a chance to meet the owners and distillers, husband and wife team Greg Stark and Karen Robinson-Stark.This is the first micro distillery in Pasadena and second one to open in Los Angeles. It is really a micro distillery with only about 1200 square feet of space but the spirits they are producing are spectacular. We tasted the California Single Malt Whiskey which was extraordinary! The California Gold Rum was rich with vanilla on the nose and palate. Can't wait to use it in a Mai Tai. A California Silver Rum and a silver over proof 151 rum full of fire! Great for tiki drinks. The Sunshine Orange Brandy at 100 proof, what a great Eau de Vie de Orange! This one is just screaming to get into your margarita! Full of natural orange aroma and flavor. The Skyline Gin was fantastic, made in the new world style with just enough hints of juniper and a fantastic Peated Single Malt Whiskey that took me back to my last trip to Scotland. As you can tell I am a big fan now.Thank you Stark Spirits! You can find Stark at Mission Liquor in Pasadena. I highly recommend calling Stark and trying to book a private tour and tasting. You will enjoy it.Alex P. from The Liquid Collaborative and Classic Mixology.",Alexander Perez
50,Local distillery concocting wonderful spirits...,"My beast knows I adore supporting local businesses and I'm all in for whiskey so for a partial night of my Born Day celebration night 2, we ended up at this small warehouse making their own spirits. We were greeted by Karen and spoke a bit about us and then the company. Afterwards she showed us the process and what was made where and with what leaving my head reeling from all that knowledge and science. The fact that some of the equipment was made by hand was mind blowing and insightful to small start up businesses and their willingness to thrive. Afterwards was the wonderful tasting of each spirit with some crackers to help even out the intake and we were excited to know of local goodness to ask for and to purchase when shopping at our local markets. Happy to receive this gift and more happy to enjoy the well balanced peetiness of whiskey I usually am not fond of! Cheers",Sunshine31291740867
50,The more you know,"Wow, I learned so much on this tour. . It takes so much time and science, it was all explained on this tour. Very personal and hands on. The samples were amazing. I truly hope they start to sell Stark Spirits at Trader Joes or my local pub. I really need people to taste their whiskey and rum . it's pretty amazing!!! Me and my girlfriend enjoyed this very much.",Sunshine67239042040
50,Distillery tour,"An informative tour, the owner showed us the still equipment and the aging barrels, and recounted the history of the business and explained the process of making the various liquors. We got to sample each variety, and snacks were provided.",Sunshine07865488441
50,Good fun,Informative and fun experience! I highly recommend this for anyone who is interested in craft distilling or trying new spirits.,Deric L
50,Fantastic Experience!,Wonderful tour followed by a tasting of these incredible spirits. Definitely a worthwhile experience. We especially enjoyed the Skyline Brandy and the Peated Whiskey......left with a bottle of each!,Relax61548266843
50,Hand crafted spirits and genuinely nice people,The care and passion of the distillers really shows in the flavors of the spirits that the Starks make. The Skyline Gin rides the razor's edge between an Old Tom and a London Dry and pleases both kinds of gin fans. The Orange Brandy is a specialty and not one to be missed. The rums and whiskeys are also delicious - not my favorite kind of spirits. But there is something for every spirits fan to enjoy.,Safari03059640134
40,Nice craft spirits tour in Pasadena,It was a good time and educational to understand the spirit making process and get a chance to sample the different spirits. Nice tour!,GrandTour21776779254
50,Excellent Tour,"I really enjoyed this tour! Owners Greg and Karen Stark and very sweet and welcoming. The tour was very informative. I learned a lot about the distillery process, aging of different spirits, bottling, and heard about their new products. At the end we enjoyed a tasting of their award winning spirits, which are distilled in small batches. Each one is numbered abd hand signed. You can also purchase their products on site. I recommend this tour!",Martinigal
50,California Micro-Distilling at it's Finest!,"We had a great time touring and tasting at Stark Spirits! I came here with 7 friends with varying levels of knowledge and enthusiasm for spirits. We all enjoyed the tour put on by Greg Stark. He made it all easy to grasp and answered questions without making us feel dumb. The distillery itself is definitely micro, which works out really well because you can literally see the whole distilling process all the way to the bottling right there in front of you. With all these huge distilleries out there, it was nice getting that personal touch. Let us not forget the actual spirits! They have something for everyone. I really enjoyed the CA Single Malt Whiskey, which was to be expected since I'm an avid whiskey enthusiast. What really (positively) surprised me is how much I enjoyed the gin and rum (they've even got a 151, if you want to breath fire). Ended up leaving with bottles of whiskey, gin, CA Rum, and Sunshine Orange Brandy (don't sleep on this one, it will surprise you with how tasty it is).If you like booze and you're in So Cal, you really HAVE TO check this place out. If you're visiting and you want to get a feel for California distilling and some unique CA flavors, make Stark Spirits a part of your visit. You'll be glad you did!",Igor Kagan
50,Sweet little distillery,"The liquor was great, it was a sweet little Ma and Pa business. Their Rum was my favorite liquor we tried.",Excursion42585280907
50,Holiday Spirits,"I enjoy good whiskey. My family took me on a visit to Stark Spirits for an early Christmas surprise. The tour is informative and entertaining (Karen is a wonderful story teller!). The tasting was great. The whiskeys indeed have character -- very nice! And it was a treat to try the aquavit! Karen and Greg are great, both as creators of wonderful spirits and as hosts.",John A
50,Excellent tasting,"We really enjoyed this distillery. The tour was very informative, and the products all tasted incredible, especially their gin and single malt. Great for anyone.",Jill G
50,Micro Distillery with Mega Character,"What a treat! Karen and Greg are making world-class spirits in a space tucked away in corner of an unassuming Pasadena industrial park. The tour is fascinating: educational, detailed, wide ranging and with humor and warmth. We tasted an amazing range of rums, whiskeys and botanical spirits, even a unique orange brandy -- everything blended, distilled, and bottled on-site. Highly recommended for epicures, tourists, factory tour buffs, and anyone in LA who thinks they've seen it all, because this is something new and not to be missed.",zradradradcek
50,A lovely birthday.,"I scheduled a visit to the distillery for my boyfriend's birthday and invited some his coworkers to come along. The tour was quiet and intimate, and we tasted some delicious alcohol. Karen was so sweet and it was clear to see the love put into the place. A very fun experience.",Scenic61820208013

They are very knowledgeable in their craft and I enjoyed the tour very much. The tasting at the end was so much fun. Karen is the sweetest person.,Desiree C
50,Great Experience,"Karen and Greg are absolutely wonderful. To say that they love what they do is an understatement. Their passion can be felt in their conversation, but most especially tasted in the spirits they make. Absolutely excellent!The Whiskey and the 151 was an experience.",Seaside53748978164
40,Unique spirits with a hometown feel...,"Was able to get the most intimate tour and the most detail I’d ever gotten from a tasting about the spirits I was tasting. Very nice people with a down home feel. The variety of tastings offered was delightful, instructions given on how best to prepare for each drink. A unique experience for our whole group!",Scenic04525319198
50,Great place! Great owners!,"The whole experience here was a blast! The owners let us try a variety of their drinks and I have to say I liked all of them! Not much of a gin fan, but I really liked theirs. Not big into peety style, like theirs. The 151 is actually pretty dang good as well. Beyond the great drinks the owners are very friendly and very knowledgeable. Definitely highly recommend Stark!",Mike Rush
50,Remarkable distillery,"Karen and Greg love their distillery and it shows in their spirits, and how happy they are to oblige your visit. Be prepared for tasty spirits and an informative tour of their establishment. It's well worth a visit for anybody in the Pasadena area. Great for couples or even a solo trip. I enjoyed their single malt whiskey and rum, but every spirit was delicious. I'd even come back for another visit.",Voyage25005593149
50,"Great spirits, great people","Living in Pasadena, I was excited to see a local distillery and this place did not disappoint. When we arrived they were in the process of making gin, and we were able to see them put together all of the botanicals that were going to go into the still. We got to see the process, the barrels aging their whiskeys, the bottling line - everything is done by hand by this couple, and you can tell how much they love and put into this business. To top it off we got to sample a little bit of everything and get some nice merchandise before we left. Overall, we had a great time!",samageenie
50,Great spirits 😊,The spirits are great and the proprietors where a lot of fun to talk to. You can see the joy they get in making a great product.,dsypowicz
50,Something Different,"You don't see a still every day.. nor do you get to taste hand-crafted spirits after seeing how much work (and all the neat stuff) that goes in to each bottle... and that's what makes a trip to Stark so special! A definite must for afficianados of gin, aquavit, rum or whiskey. Their sunshine brandy is also a unique treat not to be missed!",Michelle U
50,"Fantastic craft spirits operation, very friendly owner",Greg gave an excellent tour of his craft distillery operation. Everything they do is true to the spirit of craft distilling and their products are absolutely fantastic and fairly unique. Greg was very generous with his knowledge of distillation and why his spirits are so unique. We really appreciated learning so many new things and were able to find bottles that we hadn't yet seen in stores! Awesome!,Adam T
50,Stark Spirits best distillery in the San Gabriel Valley,"Tucked unassumingly into a corner of a business Park, Stark Spirits distills glory and love into delicious drink for those in the know. The proprietors greet visitors as if old friends, impart facts, details, folklore, and science behind their passion project and one can't help but fall in for the experience. Make a reservation, go learn and taste, and join the growing followers of Stark Spirits.",Tour606739
50,Incredible tour and tasting!,"Greg and Karen Stark run a local distillery that I have visited multiple times for their tour and tasting, bringing in new friends whenever I get the chance. Not only are they wonderfully kind distillery owns, but also incredibly knowledgeable. I have been on many distillery tours in my time and Stark stands out as my favorite, in terms of the educational aspect, the fun (again, Greg and Karen make you feel at home) and, of course, the spirits themselves. I am a huge fan of their spirits and love supporting them via buying bottles at my local shop. Whether you are a resident looking to learn more about an awesome local business or a visitor looking for something uniquely fun and educational, I urge you to visit Stark Spirits. Thanks for everything Greg and Karen!",Matt P
50,Amazing visit to local distillery,My wife and I recently discovered this local must-visit site. Free tastings are a must-do for any couple in the arena. A wonderful variety of liquors and a great tour and education if the distillation process.,McMahonLife
40,Speechless,I did not imagine that so much information could be conveyed relative to a small distillery. It was a lot of fun and very informative. (I'm not sure I visited in July; might have been August.),sbgreenstein
30,STARK Spirits,"The Distillery was quite fascinating and seeing what they could do in such a small place was awe inspiring. However, the talk itself was really too long. An abbreviated version of the distilling process would be more appealing - it took almost 1 1/2 hours and everyone was standing. The tasting itself went well, but was very hurried. A bit more time to enjoy the flavours would be relaxing and fun. By the end - everyone just wanted to leave.",Extraordinary650858
50,"Fun, tiny distillery.","We've been to Stark Spirits twice--you have to let them know ahead of time that you're coming--and enjoyed both the introduction to making various spirits and the spirits themselves. The place is owned and operated by a couple who are dedicated to getting things right, and they do. We especially like their whiskies and a delightfully unsweet aquavit.",SoBeRetired
50,Creative & Talented Owners,We had a very complete tour. The owners were open and friendly. We found it insightful how passionate they are along with being dedicated.Their spirits are inviting.,reillymusic2018

50,Wonderful small business producing first rate spirits!,"This is a must for anyone who enjoys spirits like whiskey, rum, brandy, and gin.After reading about Stark, we looked it up and were delighted to find that it was very near us, so we got in touch to arrange a tour. Scheduling was a snap, and a few dayslater we were treated to a personalized tour from Karen. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and didn't tire of our seemingly endless questions!The tasting followed and we had a delightful time trying all of their products. They really know what they are doing and have produced excellent spirits. We highly recommend a visit.",JasonKastner
50,Great visit!,Greg and Karen are distilling some excellent spirits. My favorite is the Peated Single Malt Wiskey. It is very smooth with just the right hint of peat. Their microdistillery tour is fun.,JimWCPA

Karen and Greg make every batch and sign each bottle. They are so generous with their time and knowledge and create a one of a kind tasting experience. All of the spirits were fantastic but the California whiskey and Sunshine orange brandy were my favorites! I highly recommend getting to know this Pasadena gem. Thank you Karen and Greg, this was truly a memorable experience!",Nathan D
50,An intimate distillery tour!,"Karen and Greg truly offer an intimate distillery tour and tasting. Karen is an adventurous soul who offers knowledge and perspective, along with crackers and water, and a traditional touch unmatched by other distilleries.Oh man, the peated whiskey is big. You can smell the peat. It is so good. This place is for those who are truly interested in craft spirits.Highly recommend a tour and tasting.",CaliAmber
50,AN AMAZING TOUR AND AN AMAZING FAMILY RAN DISTILLERY!!!,"We had some time in L.A so we decided to visit some distilleries. We went to a total of 4 and I would like to share that there was one that really stood out from the others...Starks Distillery was such a treat for different reasons. The first was their products whiskey, gin, brandy, vodka and so on where by far the best quality each one made the old fashion way with no short cuts. The tour guide was actually the owner himself Mr. Stark and his knowledge of the science behind his gold medal liquors was very indepth. The other tour companies rushed us through and we found that their product where made the same way very rushed not authentic at all!Mr. Stark and his wife, son and daughter invited our group to actually sit down for crackers and cheese as they shared their story with us and that says it all it really made our trip. The larger distilleries were very impersonal and very scripted not nearly as enjoyable as this one. If you are thinking about investing into a hobby home kit you should take this tour and ask if the owners are available to do a personal tour!",naturesempress
50,Stark Spirits are the BEST! Highly Recommend! Thumbs Up!,"Stark Spirits are the BEST! Highly recommend! Thumbs Up! Great experience at the distillery! Very unique and educational tour. Stark Spirits have a variety of products you can choose from and it makes such a great gift. I love the fact that Sunshine brandy, is made ONLY from California oranges and nothing else. It is very unique product. I do not believe that words or description of the flavor can justify the experience. Just try it! Make sure you also try Aquavit! The flavor of rye bread and caraway is truly amazing! If you like herring, Aquavit is great with it.",ija1212
50,Amazing Top Shelf Products.,"This is a family owned distillery that has amazing products. As this was my first distillery tour, and the information presented by our guide Greg, was absolutely fantastic. Karen did an excellent job with the tasting, and explaining the different products. The products were top shelf. I would highly recommend this tour.",Laura W
50,It's a little hidden jem!,"This distillery is a hidden little place that gives such an amazing tour and truly explains the process of making alcohol! I never knew just how much work goes into making the rum and gin that I love. If you ever get a chance you should totally check this place out and try their award winning rum and peated whiskey. If you are a connoisseur of alcohol or just a person who loves the taste, you really need to stop by this little place!",Ashlee J
