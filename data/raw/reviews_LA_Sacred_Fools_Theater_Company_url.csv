50,Great theater company,"Fantastic group housed at the Broadwater. No ticket is more than $15, so you can see everything they produce. Wide variety of show options; professional performers...can't go wrong! Stop in at eh Plunge for an after show drink!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryKop
50,The Tops of LA's Intimate Theatre Scene.,"Sacred Fools commits itself to professional, exciting, boundary pushing works. I just recently saw their production of Mr. Burns: a post-electric play, and it exceeded every expectation thatI had, and then some. It might be an intimate theatre, but trust me when I say that your $15 ticket does not reflect the quality that this company is capable of. (Yes, the tickets are never more than $15--the company's mission for the 21st season is to make theater accessible to everyone at all times. If that's not a worthwhile cause, I don't know what is) It is one of the best places for live theater in the city; whether you've been in LA for years, or just in town for a visit, stop by and visit the Fools! You won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristyn_Ev
50,Some of LA's BEST Theater happens here!!!,"Full disclosure, I've done some work here, but I've been coming to Sacred Fools Theater long before I found myself lucky enough to get involved. To me, Sacred Fools have always been risk-takers, unafraid to try something new which often results in huge pay offs. Many of their main stage productions have enjoyed lives beyond their 99 seat Sacred Fools productions such as Louis & Keely Live at the Sahara, Stoneface, Watson and Absolutely Filthy.Make no mistake, this is an intimate 99 seat theater, yet their production values greatly exceed their budgets, mostly due to the amazing talent they attract. You'll most likely recognize some of the talent from commercials, television, film and other shows around town.The spirit of Sacred Fools lies in their late night show, ""Serial Killers"" that plays nearly every Saturday night at 11pm (running parallel to their main stage shows). For only $10 you'll see FIVE plays (3 returning and 2 challengers) that range from 8-12 minutes. At the end of the show, the audience votes on which three story lines they'd like to see return for a new episode! The show keeps running until the playoffs at the end of the season when all the most popular shows of the year do battle in a bracket style format! This is a MUST see!!! Bring your out of town friends for a great night of comedy!They recently made an ambitious move from their home of nearly 20 years, and moved into a space that now runs FOUR theater spaces and will soon be opening a bar! Definitely see what is currently playing there and get tickets!!!If you're visiting LA or have been here for years, definitely check this place out!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
