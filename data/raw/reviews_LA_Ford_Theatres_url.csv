40,Have A Wonderful Time At This Outdoor Venue In The Hills,"Had a great time at this outdoor venue in the Hollywood Hills! Parking is Greek Theater style. Not paved. Not expensive though! Shuttle service up and down the hills. Reasonably priced tickets to see Women Rising Los Angeles Dance Festival. Loved it! Perfect for the outdoors. All the choreography was done by women! What a performance! Lots of ushers and lots of security. Not a bad seat in the place! Everyone brings their own food and wine like at the Hollywood Bowl. Didn't like the beef burger from the concession stand. Too much blue cheese . My friend liked the veggie burger. Drinks were ok. Next to the 101 Freeway. Gets chilly in the evening. So, bring a sweater or blanket! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresaw353
50,Best Venue Ever,"I would highly recommend this venue. It's BEAUTIFUL and there truly isn't a bad seat in the house...really. It has the coolest vibe, lighting is nice, food court, you can bring your own food and drinks if you'd like. I call in the miniature Hollywood Bowl. Buy your tickets now!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunnyvic
50,"Stunning, Emotional performance in a grand setting.","Went to Ford Theater to experience the 'LOST' experience. This was my original goal in going to LA, and bought the tickets before the sold out in less than 24 hours. The theater is not nearly as large as the Hollywood Bowl just up the street, but it is large enough. Built into the hillside, the outer walls encircle and meet the hill around the stage area, and is open to the stars. Overall, very comfortable seating with adequate space, the reflection of the music off the hillside added depth to the performance. If you are a fan of the TV show LOST... you must have this experience on your bucket list. Truly an amazing performance by the orchestra, and we were treated to some extras which were not announced until it happened. First, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, (creators and writers for the show), had a question/answer period before the show. Then several of the actors on the show began showing up on stage... Sawyer, (Josh Holloway), came out... followed by Claire, (Emilie De Ravin), then Charlotte, (Rebecca Mader), Nadia, (Andrea Gabriel), and Jin, (Daniel Day Kim)... they contributed to the discussion and when the concert was set to begin, they took seats in the audience themselves... and Jin and Sawyer sat in the seats next to me! Afterward, they hung around for autographs and chat... Most of them leaving before I could reach them, but Damon stayed and made sure everyone that wanted a pic and autograph with him got it... love how he stays in touch with his audience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russellt386
50,Stunning venue!,Loved visiting this outdoor venue for a concert. It’s small and intimate so you’re never too far from the action. The acoustics made the performance really special and the seats were comfortable. It’s also in a convenient location and easy to get to. I was glad to have had the opportunity to visit this theatre!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaelaceleste
40,Great venue for performances,"I've been to the Ford Theatre for two performances, and like the venue. It feels intimate and the stage is close enough for good viewing. It can be chilly at night, and the Santa Ana winds can blow up dust and cause discomfort. Parking is a challenge, so if you want to be on the lot, get there as soon as the gates open for the performance. The food has been upgraded during the past two years, and further improvements can still be made. Lovely overall experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tangier14
50,Big World Fun,This is a very beautiful and clean outdoor theatre nestled in the Hollywood Hills that offers free summer shows for kids. The cost was $5 for 13 and up and $5 for parking. We went for the first show of the summer to see LE BALLET DEMBAYA perform. We arrived at 9am sharp so that we could park in the non stacked parking area which they fill up first. Preshow included learning about multiple animals on our way up the stairs. They also had craft activities were my kids made bow ties for the show. We bought some donuts and juice for breakfast and they allowed us to bring it in to the theatre. Seating was open and we sat near the front although sitting anywhere is a great view (unless someone tall is in front of you) since it has theater seating. My kids loved the African dancing at the show and even participated in dancing and exercising during the show. They also taught the kids how to sing in an African language. My kids loved coming here and we plan to come again.Tip:Be prepared for Hollywood trafficArrive early to park in non stacked parking areaBring a small blanket or jacket since it can sometimes be a little chilly in the morning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Exquize
40,A nice small theater,A nice small outdoor theatre which is not too uncomfortable. Bring a jacket if it gets too cold. Also water on hot days is a must.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johntuck77
40,A lovely venue for an outdoor concert,"Went here for a jazz concert with the kids and enjoyed the venue. We arrived early and the event was not very busy so parking on site was not a problem. It is stacked parking but we were able to leave quite promptly upon returning to our car at the end of the concert. There is a steep climb up to the theatre so be prepared for that. The walk up is pleasant and includes nice areas to site and picnic and enjoy the outdoors. We were in the cheap seats but could hear and see quite well without obstruction. Again, it wasn't full but even if it had been the sight lines were fine. The acoustics were very nice without any boominess or other problems you sometimes get with outdoor venues. My only complaint was at how expensive the snacks were at the snack bar. A pack of chips was $5 which even by these sorts of venues standards is outrageous. Luckily the ticket price for our concert was quite reasonable. Definitely would go back to another concert here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaQi
40,Very nice place to visit and see a show.,It has been improved and it has easier access once inside the venue. They have elevators to all levels if stairs are not your favorite. I went to a concert at this outdoor venue very near the Hollywood Bowl. The parking is stacked so we took a shuttle from another parking lot which was free. The parking was not free. Getting out of the place after the show was a little slow but the parking lot was very close to freeway and got to avoid the Bowl traffic.We had some food there and it was ok. Just ok. You can bring your own food and beverages including wine. There are lots of tables and places to sit and eat before the show. It gets chilly at night so be prepared for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K0OXmariel
50,Intimate Venue,"This theater has to be the cutest and most intimate place that I attended a concert at-what a gem in the heart of L.A. Attended the Africa Rising show, what a marvelous show that was. The show feature very talented artist: Rocky Dawuni (Ghanian raggea musician), Dexter Story & Wondem (East African musicians doing a hybrid of jazz, funk, soul), Marie Daulne (known as Zap Mama is Congolese-Belgian artist) and Kara Mack (dancer and choreographer). Totally enjoyed every minute of the show. I only have been to the Ford Theater after the renovation and it's beautifully done. Parking might be difficult so try to park at the off-site parking. There is traffic almost every time in that area, so be prepared for that.You can buy food from Grab & Go Market, located at the Edison Plaza or bring your own picnic. Gourmet Box Dinners may be pre-ordered when purchasing tickets. Some menu items from the theater are: snacks, salads, sandwiches, beer, wine, water and soda.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsiona707
50,"Wow, what a great venue!","I saw an improv show here and was blown away. Impro Theatre's main troupe performed an amazing play called LA Noir. The evening performance with a very talented improv company was a real treat in this natural rocky grotto on a beautiful night in LA. It was one a wonderful evening in LA with drama, a lot of comedy, good food and craft beer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerrygoff78735
50,Amazing place to see a concert!,As soon as you walk in. You know you are experiencing a part of history. The theater has been able to modernize yet hold onto that feel of old Hollywood. The bathrooms add to the uniqueness with black commodes and mood lighting. The acoustics are amazing and every place you stand has a great view of the stage. This was the second show I have seen here and both have been awesome experiences.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyTDJ
50,Lovely outdoor ampitheater,"We attended the recent LOST concert at this venue and it was a magical evening. We got there early so we could park nearby. Their parking is limited and stacked, so if you don't want to arrive early or wait around after your event is over, Uber, Metro or use their shuttle get there.There is beer, wine and snacks for purchase, but they also allow you to bring your own. There are multiple tables and places to relax before the event and people watch. The venue itself is small, seats about 1200, so it feels very intimate. The stage is nestled into the hills and nature provides a beautiful backdrop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuLo1965
50,What a beautiful evening and atmosphere!,"We went to the Lost Concert with Michael Giacchino. The venue parking is not good, so get there early. There are A LOT of stairs to climb, but after those 2 obstacles, it was PERFECT! Everyone was friendly and knew their way around, During the 15 minute intermission, everyone got up to use the restroom, They had 2 women assigned to get the line to move quickly and that is what they did. With the line as long as you can imagine, we waited no longer than 2 minutes and we were at the end. IT WAS PERFECT!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LLevy412
50,Beautiful theatre!,It's like stepping out of LA into a beautiful garden lodge in the woods. On top of the beautiful surroundings we saw an awesome show!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicbug74
