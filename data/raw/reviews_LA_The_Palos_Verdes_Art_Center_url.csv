50,ART AS EYE SEE IT !,This ism fantastic community art center.....and just like art.....there are all kinds of it.....BUT this is a wonderful place to get instruction and participate in any kind of it!,travel Guy
20,Not impressed!,The classes listed for the Fall were expensive for what they seemed to offer and the subjects that they covered. We seemed to have hit a slot between touring exhibitions - there was little of interest to justify more than a brief visit.,Steve M
20,Class are expensive,"It's very expensive to take a class. Wasn't impressed with the beginning ceramics teacher. He always started classses late and was more interested in working on his own work. Considering the cost of the class, he provided very little instruction. What I learned was from the other students who have taken the class before.",ncjc2013
50,Top Class Exhibition at PVAC,"Palos Verdes Art Center has a wonderful gallery that displays international class artwork on a rotating, museum-like schedule. Off the beaten path, about 10 miles from Los Angeles, it's worth the excursion. Great gift shop and work spaces as well.",eheyman
20,Small and Weak,"Went here to see the modern architecture exhibit of Neutra and Williams residences in the PV area. Very small one room display of mostly plans and ledgers of the budgets for the homes. This center could be great, like many of the cultural aspects of PV, but it fails due to limited budgets, lack of leadership and myopic view that does not see PV as part of the greater Los Angeles region that is finally becoming a world class area rivaling NYC, Chicago, SF, Dallas and others.",PVGreg
30,Remodeled and now not as affordable,"Small local art center that seems to serve more as a social club for members, especially those that donate a lot. Since remodel, prices for classes have risen quite a bit. They have lost many former instructors, so fewer classes for adults. More classes for kids.",Montagirl
40,Memorable Monthly Anniversary,"On my husband's and my monthly anniversary #323, we visited the Palos Verdes Art Center. We always enjoy viewing the art on display, browsing the gift shop, and relaxing in the patio on the enclosed deck. On this visit, we spent time at the exhibits, and were especially fascinated by the one focusing on Acquired Objects: textiles, tools & notions from the Judith Solomon Collection, We were surprised that a cafe is now on the premises. As a treat, we went to the Strip Cafe, where we enjoyed a slice of lavendar-infused olive-oil cake with lemon curd, topped with two fresh raspberries. Yum. Oh my but it was delicious. I had an expresso and my husband had a macchiato, each presented in a demitasse cup with an itty-bitty silver teaspoon.",tapbelle
50,PV Surprise,"It may be common for larger cities in suburbia to have some form of art instruction available .. but all too often they are in some kind of Adult School or weekend classes in some marginal venue or other. It is quite a surprise to find The Palos Verdes Art Center in such a nice location with a newly extended building and with such a variety of quite professional classes. Their latest innovation is Glass Blowing! The real thing! .. not making kiddy toys out of glass tubing, but real 'hot stuff'. And this is only one of the many classes they have been offering for years up here on The Hill. PVAC may be slightly short of Otis or Art Center , but the teachers have always been legitimate artists and/or professional teachers. Over the last 30 plus years, I have attended classes in Watercolor, Life Drawing and oil painting. Family members have also taken ceramics (there is a kiln on the property), sculpture and that Glass Blowing class. Also be aware that there is a small museum and gift shop to complete their offerings.",PVtalker
