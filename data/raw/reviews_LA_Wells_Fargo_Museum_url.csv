50,Western mood,"Amazing little museum where kids can interact with things and there are little treasures from the western American world, like some furniture and an old stagecoach. It's free. For me it was a hidden gem in the middle of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goldycat
40,Very interesting museum about Wells Fargo,"Unfortunately this little gem of a museum is tucked away on the interior of the Wells Fargo Center on Bunker Hill in Downtown Los Angeles. There is really no signage of the existence of the museum from the street levels surrounding the Wells Fargo Center. Open during banking hours (just Monday through Friday), this museum gives the history of Wells Fargo which started as an express company during the California gold rush and how it grew as a stagecoach and express business and eventually into the large national bank that it is today. The museum contains some very interesting exhibits and displays that show the history of Wells Fargo through the years. It has an original Concord stagecoach from the 1890s that was used in the old West as well as many tools and assaying instruments used during the gold rush. Also an interesting video showing the history of Wells Fargo; very enlightening about how Wells Fargo survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and continued to provide banking services despite having its SF headquarters destroyed. Also nice displays about Wells Fargo stagecoaches and stagecoach robberies including the infamous ""Black Bart."" Nice displays of currency and coinage through the years. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,A hidden gem and totally free,"This place is slightly hidden away, tucked behind the huge Wells Fargo tower in downtown Los Angeles. However it’s well worth a visit, and admission is absolutely free.It tells the story of how the Wells Fargo company rose out of the California Gold Rush, and includes a multitude of exhibits including original stagecoaches.The receptionist was extremely helpful… There are restrooms and a café just outside the door on the ground floor of the Wells Fargo building itself..Highly recommended…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/d08scl

40,Well worth an hour of your time,"We stopped by on our way home after lunch. Thought it might give some background to the “cowboy” films that I watched in the early 1960s - and I certainly was not disappointed. This museum is good for adults and children alike. Plenty of historical information and interactive exhibits, in addition to an actual original stagecoach. You certainly get the fell for the mid 19th century in the “wild west” and gold rush period, and it’s free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/584philt

30,Enjoyable & interesting,"While sightseeing in downtown L.A. we came across this museum. It was much better than I expected. It is complimentary and gives a good overview of the history of the company and its signature stagecoach line. They also have a short historical video. They do a good job of describing what it was like for passengers traveling by stagecoach. It doesn’t take long to go through the museum, 30 minutes at most. It’s very close to the MOCA as well as the Disney Concert Hall. (I’d give it 3 1/2 stars as I did enjoy it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingCAgal
40,Great free museum for a one hour visit in downtown LA,"Great little free museum. Has an original 1800's Wells Fargo stage coach and replica you can sit in.

40,A Lot Packed into A Small Museum,"Although small, one room, this museum was packed with lots of interesting things where you will learn all about the Gold Rush, and how people moved east to west in this country, and the founding of the united states banking system. It was informative, and the guy who was running the museum was very nice and welcoming. There is also an informative video. A visit takes about 1 hour including the video. Its convenient to two of the art museums, so you could plan a visit and do all 3 things.Also the museum is free, and accessed best if you are walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwardbeeler
50,Awesome and FREE!,"Admission in this museum is FREE! It's right at the heart of LA (near Walt Disney Concert Hall and MOCA).

50,History museum is worth your time,"This is one of few WF History museums throughout the country and it should be on your bucket list to see when in downtown LA. This place is a little piece of Americana that is nicely appointed with artifacts and info about the evolution of the company and country. There is a short film in the theater in the back and lots of hands on experiences as well. Make sure you take your picture with the authentic stagecoach -- only 16 exist in the world!

50,LA's hidden jem!,"I had some time to explore downtown Los Angeles recently and I decided to visit the Wells Fargo History Museum. On entering I was immediately greeted by a very friendly staff member. He was very enthusiastic about the museum and his enthusiasm was contagious. After getting lots of great info from him, another staff member showed me a working telegram machine which is set up for visitors to use.I ended up spending much more time there than I expected because of all the interesting displays and artwork. Before leaving, I was given a souvenir token which is part of a set one can collected when visiting other Wells Fargo museums around the country. I highly recommend this museum for kids and adults alike. There is much to see and learn here. I'm really glad I took the time to visit and the staff made me feel very welcomed. They are top notch. Next time I go, I'll bring friends or family to enjoy this great hidden jem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OldSchoolJesse
50,A wonderful step back in time!,"This is a wonderful hands-on step back into the Gold Rush period of time! My middle school aged nieces loved sending messages with Morse code. It was amazing seeing maps of LA from the late 1800's. As a fourth grade teacher, I highly recommend it for a field trip. The kids will learn a lot from this very engaging museum. It is small, but rich in artifacts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,An unexpected museum,"It was great to enter this fascinating museum and learn about California Gold Rush, among several other things, enjoy the old fashioned office of a banking house and be attended by a very welcoming guy to buy some souvenirs! Thanks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donatellal61
50,Great addition to tour of Los Angeles,"Stopped at the Wells Fargo History Museum as part of a first grade field trip. It's great for the kids to see a stagecoach and then to find out that 18 people traveled in and on one stagecoach!! It's also fun to see the gold and other minerals. The Pong game was a hit with some of the kids who love video games!It's small, but filled with lots of hands on learning. Great for 15 - 30 minutes to add to a field trip or if you want some history with your walking around and eating your way through Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marsig2014
50,Field trip for fourth graders,"I teach fourth grade and took my students here who have been studying about the California Gold Rush, they loved it... I highly recommend it👍",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T3314RImaryr
50,Hidden Gem!,"I would've never imagined that Wells Fargo had a museum, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's small, but there's lots of amazing things to look at, including a genuine stagecoach from 1895. There's an incredible amount of history in the company name, and it is closely tied in with the California Gold Rush. The museum also had a replica stagecoach which you can climb on inside of. There's real gold you can look at too, including a two pound nugget. They have a room which is designed to look like a baking house with a working telegraph you can try out also. Overall it's a fascinating museum and I would definitely recommend it to everyone, especially if you're into California history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianaaM6950PQ
50,A Hidden Gem,We stumbled upon the WFHM by chance and WOW what a delightful surprise. We were welcomed by Trent the Museum Assistant who shared stories about California during the Gold Rush and how LA was once upon a time.The museum is small but rich with history and stories for both young and older - especially those who grew up on stories of the Wild West and stagecoach rides.After riding the coach and hearing the tales you can't help but feel awe and admiration for the people of the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/517judyy
50,See a Real Stagecoach!,"Everyone has seen movies with stagecoaches. How about having a closeup look at the real thing at the Wells Fargo Museum. This is a very small museum and it's free and easy to visit. If you are doing a walk around downtown L.A. you can find this in the Wells Fargo Plaza, on the ground floor of one of the granite skyscrapers. The docents there are helpful and will tell you anything you want to know about the stagecoach or items in the museum. You can spend 5 minutes or an hour in there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyk220
50,Great (and Unexpected) Find!,"We were going to The Broad Museum and decided to see what else there was to do in the area. Saw that there was a WFHM and decided to stop in and see the exhibits. WOW! We learned so much that we thought about opening an account at WF. Very impressive.What did we like? Although the museum was small, it was full of good information, presented in an easy to read manner.*Great information about the diversity of the early WF employees and the emphasis on education back in the 1800s.**LOVED the stagecoach ""ride"" and even got my 76 year old mother to hop on board. **Got a chuckle out of the stuffed horses (they are large stuffed animals)...until we found out that they were actually modeled after real historical horses.The museum staff was very friendly, answered all of our questions, and were passionate about their work. Great to see such young museum curators.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M4735PUlynnl
50,Informative and fun,"We stopped in as part of a walking tour of Los Angeles. Wow! The docent was so knowledgeable and helpful.

50,Pretty cool!,"This is a neat little museum; free, organized, and is a legitimate museum with legitimately ""neat stuff"" in it.Staff were super friendly and helpful.

40,Worth a stop...,"The history of WF and how it relates to the California Gold Rush is quite interesting. Located in an area full of foodie and coffee spots, you'd be doing yourself a favor grabbing a coffee and stopping in for a look. The video in back is worth the time as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeeterf15
50,Interesting,"I like museums. I liked this one, it is relatively small but good use of space. Linked the beginning through 2008. Has old actual stuff, relics, gold and interactive technology. A few things for the kids to do besides viewing ""old stuff.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpsbigr
50,Pleasantly Surprised,My wife and I were not expecting this at all. At the base of a high rise in Wells Fargo Center is a legitimate history museum that describes the history of wells fargo and parts of southern California. There were lots of well documented displays and real artifacts. It was free! The docents were VERY friendly and informative. We even got a cookie and a free prize when we left.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jaydub321
50,Seniors loved it!,"We organized a senior (older adult) group tour at this museum and they raved about how interesting it was and how much they learned! Excellent customer service, very easy to work with, and one of our best excursions. Thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mjshammas
40,A glimpse into the old west,"This little gem of a museum is located in the wells fargo building in downtown LA. It traces the roots of the wells fargo company to its present day.Lots of props including a full size stagecoach, safes, telegrapg tickers to test your morse code skills.An interesting place to spend an hour or so. And it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shivs
40,Its free!,We were walking through Downtown LA and just happened to come across this little hidden gem. Its small but very well laid out with knowledgeable staff. Best of all...its free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonny_k86
50,Very interesting free little museum,"This is a very interesting free little museum. It is very well curated, and defiantly worth a visit. There is a real Wells Fargo Stagecoach, as well as a real gold nugget. There is also a mock up of a stagecoach that you can sit in and watch a movie of what the journey might be like, as well as a mock up of a bank in the west from the late 1800s. There is also a lot of information and artifacts on the early history of Wells Fargo, California, and the old West. All in all, this is one of the best attractions in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
40,"Quickie Stage Coach, Gold Nugget & Movie ...","The WF Museum is a little quickie museum in the giant Wells Fargo Bank building, quite similar to their eponymous museum in San Francisco. Kids go wild to see the WF stagecoach, gold nugget and Wild West ephemera, and it's fun for all ages. Downtown, and can be coupled with seeing other venues in the area. Quickie 30 minute free museum is worthwhile, enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Makes for a nice stop off on a walking tour of Downtown LA,"I't only a small place, but it's really well laid out, and the staff were really nice and helpful with guides and activity books for the kids (English and Spanish). Lots of interesting history about the Bank and California, though typically the thing that held most attention for the kids was the exhibit of ""Pong"" the first computer game. Probably you wouldn't make a special trip here, but being just a short walk from the top of Angels Flight if you are doing a walking tour of downtown LA it's definately worth a stop off",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobH924
50,"Small Museum, but Worth a Visit","I read about this giant gold nugget in the AAA book and wanted to see it so we went here. It turned out to be much more interesting than I thought. Just inside the door was an old Wells Fargo stage coach. It is hard to imagine that folks travelled for days in the close quarters one one of these vehicles. I could imagine your back would be in serious pain after a few days. One of the other things I liked was the original legers they had. It was cool to browse the time worn books and see the entries made over 100 years ago. There is also a short film which is part advertising and part history lesson, but still worth seeing. I did get to see the gold nugget (found in 1975 by the way). The artifacts they had there let you get an interesting feel for what life was like in the old west.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amease
40,Well worth visiting,We enjoyed this free museum in the Wells Fargo Building. It doesn't take long to wander around but they have a movie you can watch in a stage coach and interesting exhibits which are well signposted. It was well worth having a look around if you're in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shellsb
30,Its Ok,Its good to see where did those bloodsuckers begun their journey. All in all is an ok place and the location is very convenient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esvian
50,Short and fun visit !,"It will take you about 30-45 minutes to visit this small museum. It's FREE !Watch the short movie and stroll around the nice and interesting exibits.Very interesting for adults as for children (for children... I imagine, we didn't have any with us).Some cute Wells Fargo souvenirs for sale also.It is right in downtown LA, in the Wells Fargo building which you can't miss.Of course, I would not plan a trip to LA to visit this museum but it is right downtown, very close to the Angels Flight (actually a good idea to take the AF up, go to WF museum and take the AF back down).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben0844
20,"Have 15 to 30 minutes, stop by. Wouldn't plan a trip to it, though.","If you can't say anything nice, then don't say it. Uuuummmm. . . Nice historical items. Attendants were helpful. Wagon and statues were alright, but to give it a five. Two is generous. Fifteen to thirty minutes--at most--one can spend here. If you are a slow reader. To give it the Pub, some travel books give it, it must be some financial institution funding it. Hmmmm? At any rate, compared to other historical museums, like the Autry, Natural History, or any of the California Missions, well I would say go there instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/galahad17
50,"Fourth Grade Parents, This is the Place to Visit","Tucked away between the giant skyscrapers, and just a block from the Walt Disney Concert Hall is the best free museum I've found in LA. Have an incoming fourth grader? This will give them a leg up--from the Butterfield Stage Coach, to the 49ers, to all sorts of interactive exhibits that will leave a lasting impression.The only drawback is that they have bank hours and observe bank holidays, so getting in there is a little tough, but during spring break or over summer vacation if you have a student studying California history, or you're a nostalgia buff (they have the old Crocker Spaniel stuffed animals). Use this as a bonus museum on an outing to downtown--it's just a couple of blocks from a couple of Red Line train stations--and your day will be complete. Plenty of very reasonable souvenirs--starting at a dollar or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
