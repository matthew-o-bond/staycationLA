40,Fun trivia night,Went on a Wednesday night. Good beer selection. They had a food truck for pizza there as they do not have their own kitchen. The pizza was very good. We would go back.,scubamex
50,Lovely,"Enjoyed a lovely memorial day afternoon on the Patio. Sun was shining and the beers were delicious. Great vibe, friendly staff and a food truck selling some delicious food right next to the patio.Good times!",Amy V
30,Great space with decent beer,"Nice open indoor and outdoor space. Tasted four flavors: Mission Beach; Dunkel; Lima Buna; and Josie Wit. Mission and Dunkel weâ€™re okay, but Lima and Josie were better. Overall, not a bad place to meet up for a beer, but there is heavy competition for quality with other breweries in the area.",TravelDispatch
40,Well worth trying out for the Experience - Liking for Craft Beer helpful not essential,"We went here as a Family - Grandparents, Parents and two very young children.It has a nice ""vibe"" and the staff are very fun and helpful.We all started with the excellent tasting tray options of 5 beers - and then majored on our particular favourites. Some are quite strong - so best to nominate a Driver.Not easy to find - it is a bit tucked away in an industrial area (well it is a brewery !!!!!!!)Games - for both adults and children - to keep all amused - are thoughtfully provided and are free to use.",BobandJosie
