50,"Tucked away in an expected location, this place has a cool, off-the-beaten path vibe and the wines don't dissapoint!","While it is true that the measure of a winery is all about the wine, and all of the reds we tried, every single one of them, were also delicious, it should be mentioned that the way you are treated, the ambiance, the TOTAL PICTURE is also a factor as to whether or not you enjoyed the wine tasting experience.Our bartender, Christine, was FABULOUS! She was informative, entertaining and extremely customer-service oriented. She makes the place welcoming and we were so happy to have done a tasting at this winery.Looking forward to seeing this place develop. Don't let the dirt road and sketchy surroundings deter you from trying this gem out.Cheers!",SilverLake2TheWorld
