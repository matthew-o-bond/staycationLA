40,I enjoy the Wine Tasting experience at Reyes Winery,"I’ve read the other reviews and I must say that Reyes might have also since it seems they may have made some worthy improvements in the last couple years, since those reviews were written. I’ve visited Reyes Winery several times over the past year, today being the most recent, as I live relatively nearby (within a 40 min. drive).The tasting room is still a bit small and yes, it can get “cozy” with the other tasters, but everyone mingles well. They are very pleasant and do try to give the background of each wine as you’re sampling it. I have not noticed any smell of moth balls or other objectionable odors while visiting. They could do a bit better in offering crackers or water, but are happy to oblige if just asked. Unlike the other Winery in Agua Dulce, Reyes does offer a meat & cheese plate for purchase (could be improved on a bit, but still nice to have the option). The other winery requires you to purchase cheese, crackers, meats all separately and they MUST be eaten outside (so it’s a constant up/down, in & out for your next tasting). Reyes, provides the meat & cheese plate and you’re allowed to enjoy it inside to accompany your tastings of the wines, of which you're able to choose 7 wines from the 20+(?) wine selections offered. They also will waive your tasting fee should you choose to join their membership program or I believe also if you purchase a couple of bottles while there.Overall, I enjoy Reyes. No it’s not like the larger wineries in Paso, and Napa but it’s a nice little local winery, with pleasant people working there and a nice view of the vineyard should you choose to sit outside and enjoy the patio as well.P.S. You’re also welcome to bring your own charcuteries to enjoy while sitting out on the patio.",Sheri D
10,Disappointed,"Was referred to this place by another winery where I enjoy their wines so we made the trip to Reyes. It's a nice drive in a rural setting. That was the best part. Outside, there are two seating areas, one is VIPs (maybe that means their wine club members)and the other is for the commoners. Didn't pay much attention to this, although I did notice a dog laying in the shade so maybe they're dog friendly. I didn't see the dog inside. Speaking of which, upon entering the tasting room, the first thing I noticed was the smell of moth balls. The overwhelming, overpowering, stench of urinal cakes so pungent that there was no hope of tasting anything. For $10, you get 7 tastes of your choosing. The wine club information is on the back of the menu. Crackers were offered after another woman asked for some. No information was provided about the wines we tried, tho the bottle was parked in front of us so I suppose if we really wanted to, we could have read it. But honestly, they all tasted like moth balls. It was impossible to truly taste the wine.",IrishHazelEyes
40,Great Spot for a Taste,"The Reyes Family Winery was a delightful surprise - a little small but well worth the trip. On the recommendation of a friend, I decided to check it out. The tasting room was a bit tight however we became chummy with the other lovers of the grape. We sipped and sampled some special and unique wines. We will definitely be back!",54jh2013
30,Disappointed,"My friend and I went because they were having wine and chocolate pairing. The wine was good, the chocolate was amazing! The tastings (for the wine), is $10 per person, which is NOT waived if you buy wine. I was prepared to buy about $100 of wine, so I asked the person pouring if she would waive the tasting fee if I bought at least 2 bottles of wine. She said their wine was priced so low that they could not waive the tasting fee!!I have been to Temecula and Paso and every winery I've ever been to has waived the tasting fee if you buy at least two bottles of wine. So guess what? I bought chocolate, but no wine! I went to Aqua Dulce Winery right down the road and was treated much better there and the wine was better as well. I don't see myself and my friend going back to Reyes.",53Marie123
10,Disappointing,"There are only 2 wineries in the Aqua Dulce area, both within a mile of each other. We hit them both yesterday afternoon, as we've lived in the Santa Clarita area for over a year and hadn't tried them yet. Reyes was a disappointment. Wines, for the most part, were mediocre. We did like the 2009 Cab and the 2011 Robby's Blend. But, to our surprise, the $10 tasting fee wasn't waived when we made a purchase. (We had shared one tasting, so this would've cost them only $10, or a bit more than 10% of our purchase. Not a good way to invite us back. I won't name the other winery down the road, as that's not nice to do in a review, but they waived the tasting fee when we made a purchase. We'll be back to the ""other"" tasting room, but we won't bother visiting Reyes again.",Dale G
10,Robert Reyes is a villain,"Robert Reyes buys property and displaces the life-long tenants, making them homeless, for profit. Buying his wine supports this behavior.",413ricardo
40,"Not that pretty, but good wines","We really liked most of the wines we tasted here. The Chard was just like I like it. The 2009 Merlo was very good. Both my wife and I agreed. Prices were in the late teens to mid 20's. Only a 5% case discount. My wife like two other wines as much as the Merlo, while I found them only good. That is high praise for a modest place in the middle of the dessert",ranles76
40,Great way to spend an afternoon!,"We discovered a winery in Agua Dulce (about 40 minutes from Burbank on the 14 freeway heading to Lancaster/ Palmdale) through a website LocalWineEvents.com. We had been to a winery in Agua Dulce about 10 years ago and thought this might be the same winery under different ownership. However after doing some Internet investigation we found that this is a new winery in the same neighborhood. The tasting room has been open about a year. We also found a Yelp deal where we could purchase a $50 certificate for $30. Yelp had some pretty good reviews and since it was a beautiful day, we grabbed our certificate, packed a picnic and headed to the winery. When we arrived we were greeted by the winery dog, Oso, a big and gentle German Shepard. Since we were the only people in the tasting room for a part of our visit, we got a lot of personal service. All of their wines are estate grown. The 16-acre vineyard was planted by Robert Reyes and his family in April of 2004, and consists of five varietals: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Chardonnay, and Muscat. They had all of their wines available to taste. The tasting is $7. Not a bad deal! Their Chardonnays are not your typical Chardonnay. They were very crisp, unoaked, clean and fruity. Their whites tend to be on the sweet side, not my preference but they were well produced. The reds had some interesting bouquets and flavors. One of the interesting things we found true of both the reds and the whites, there seemed to be a big style change in the varietal from year to year. We bought a couple of bottles to bring home plus one for our picnic.Under a tree, they set up a table and chairs so we could enjoy a nice picnic. Oso seemed to be interested in our picnic too! Good wine,good food and nice vistas! We can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon.",Kodiboyphil
