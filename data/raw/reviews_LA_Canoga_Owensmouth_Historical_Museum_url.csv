40,Local History,"I don't think this museum would interest many who don't have ties to the area, but having grown up in Canoga Park, I enjoyed this walk through nostalgia. The museum isn't large, just a small room with a few display cases and walls with framed photos. Larger and smaller multi-purpose rooms hold displays when the museum is open and serves other uses when closed. The museum, open second and fourth Sunday (2:00 pm - 4:00 pm), is in the back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
