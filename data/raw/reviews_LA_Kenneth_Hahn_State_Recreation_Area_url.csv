50,beautiful view...awesome trails,"several differnet venues...open space, picnic grounds , flowing stream, clean restrooms, grounds are well kept and litter free, hiking trail and exercise spots.. ive seen family gatherings and weddings.. the place is OUTSTANDING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhatwo
50,The Best Park in the City,"Kenneth Hahn State Park is just wonderful. It is huge, but you can go there for a few minutes with the kids, or spend the day hiking and seeing some great views. The park is open 7 days a week and parking is usually free. I go there with my grandson just to use the children's park. I am not a big hiker.The park is well maintained and all the areas are great. There is a lake with swans, a bunch of hiking trails with some great views of the City or you can just take the kids to the park.It is not that easy to find so watch for the signs. You will be going right off La Cienega, up a little road and there you are. If you are visiting the City, it is not a must see, but if you have the time, it is very nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,LA’s Version of Central Park,"Surrounded by city, this park is a sprawling oasis of beauty, recreation and views. Mapped trails....some natural and some paved. There is a small lake with an rippling brook and photogs abound in this area. If you want a peaceful zen respite, spend some time strolling through the Japanese garden. Several playgrounds are situated throughout. As you drive through the park you are ascending to the furthest end of the park where there is another playground, 10 station outdoor exercise park, dog park and a panoramic view of LA. The $6 per vehicle admission is worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M7580OSteresah
50,Urban park with views close to the airport,"This park is a marvelous place to visit if you have a brief layover at LAX and want to stretch your legs. It is about fifteen or twenty minutes away from the off-airport car rental areas, with plenty of parking (fee per car is $6). The park is long and sprawling, with urban woods, clusters of picnic benches throughout the whole area, and a few special nooks and crannies with interesting features. I enjoyed the Japanese-style garden. At another end of the park, there is a park-course complete with outdoor strength training equipment, and a hummingbird garden. I also spotted people flying kites in a huge open area. Throughout, there are plenty of restroom facilities, numerous picnic benches, and barbeque facilities.The main thing that drew me to the park was reading about the paths with great views of the city. My fitbit says I walked a very leisurely six miles over the course of three hours, on a combination of hills and flatter areas. Some of the roads are paved and most are dirt. It was a wonderful break from the airport and drive.Most of the park seemed safe and easy, though I wondered about a few areas of the more distant areas with breaks in the fences and graffiti. Those might not be such a good idea solo after dark. However, the main overlooks seemed reasonably well travelled, though not crowded even on a Sunday.I spotted one or two areas where a person might be able to park for free on the streets and walk in. That could be worth attempting if you are local. However, for the entrance I used, you would have to cross the freeway, and for that you are better off driving in or being dropped off. And for those of us who are out of towners, $6 for access to a safe parking lot and well maintained park where you can easily spend half a day seems extremely reasonable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahf702
40,Beautiful oasis with views of all aspects of LA,"The first thing that you need to know before visiting Kenneth Hahn park is that you need a car. As an out of towner my first attempt at visiting the park ended in failure as I was stopped in my tracks when I met the freeway. There is no pedestrian access from the La Cienega side of the park which is such a shame. Being so used to access to endless green space at home I was excited for a green park amongst so much city.So when someone suggested that I go with them to the park for a picnic I jumped at the opportunity and I am so glad that I did. The park is huge and surrounded by oil fields which makes for an interesting contrasting back drop. The picnic tables are scattered around the man made fishing lake where people go to fish and ducks/geese leisurely paddle around.There are lots of trails that take you around the fishing lake, up to Janice’s green valley which once held the reservoir and back down to the car parks.The visitor centre provided us with a map. It should be noted that the key points didn’t match up to those locations on the signs around the park. It was lucky I was with someone who had been there before.All in all a lovely park but such a shame that it isn’t easier to access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachela299
50,Hidden gem local park,"My husband and I go to this park to walk the trails for exercise. It is a local park with everything anyone could want. There are areas with exercise equipment, a fishing pond. a playground for children, basketball court, and numerous picnic areas. The view is spectacular. Parking is free during the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
40,Nice place in the middle of LA to get to nature.,This is a nice place to unwind and get into nature in the middle of LA.Just a note you could take dogs here and stay on the street not the trails. They are making all the streets open to cars so you can no longer take a dog into the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelticGirlLA
50,Relaxing,"This place has everything from a Pond, Waterfall, a Japanese Garden, Hiking/Biking Trails , Picnic Areas and a Playground. Plenty to see and do. The overlook is ridiculous.... You can totally decompress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolwU9291FA
40,Great urban park!,"This is a great LA urban park. It's $6 to park on the weekends but I think you can park offsite and walk in if you want to avoid it. We just paid for it. You get a great view of downtown LA, Hollywood and westside. Also it's filled with lovely wild flowers. It's more of a park rather than an area of hike. The trial is about 2.8 miles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsxjackie
50,Great picnic areas and hiking trails,This hidden jewel is right in our neighborhood and has excellent hiking trails with views of Los Angeles. There is exercise equipment is certain areas and also play areas for kids. There is also a fishing pond. Parking is free during the weekdays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
40,Hidden Park in Plain View ...,"Thanks to Kenny Hahn for turning an abandoned dam basin & played out oil fields into a great recreational area smack dab near the Westside, between Culver City & Baldwin Hills. Amazing job done in adding green spaces, Japanese garden, children's play areas, exercise areas, hiking trails and picnic areas. I can remember when the area was only ugly oil fields - but it's a beauty now. Pay minimal for parking only. Enjoy visiting. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Great Family/Event/Fun Area,"We had an after the wedding next day picnic with family and friends at the park. It has great shelters, ponds, enclosed center, many trails, a Japanese garden and spectacular views of LA. Really a very fine facility. Bathrooms galore!!! Yeah!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/865marciab
50,Great hike and wonderful sites,"We have been wanting to take this hike for a long time. Boy were we pleasantly surprised to find this hidden treasure in Los Angeles. It is the old Baldwin Hills Dam Site that has been made into a wonderful park and recreational area. There is a fishing pond, a Japanese garden, trees, water falls, nice walking/hiking paths, and wonderful views of the city in everydirection. It is 2.8 miles to do the entire path. It is both flat and hilly. The information I had about it described the challenge as 2.5 on a scale of 5. It is reached off of La Cienega Blvd.just south of Jefferson. The turn off, on the right, has a sign indicating the park. Ample parking is available for $6. You will love the location and the amenities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrandmaDi
40,All the elements of a good park,"This is such a great ""non-LA"" park in LA. It has two playhrounds. One that is low to the ground for littler kids, and then a regular sized one. Additionally, a huge pond with an artificial river top off the park. I saw there were a few hikes but we didn't do any of them. Maybe another time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EliE706
40,Terrific views of Los Angeles,"This park provides a view of the city of Los Angeles from the Baldwin hills east of LAX. Terrific perspective. You could also hike a quick 2 miles and see a 360 view of the LA basin on a clear day. Back in the day, the bowl was a reservoir until it collapsed and wiped out a number of homes in the area. The bowl in the middle of the park allows for a great place for a picnic or for exercise. There are other sections of the park near a lake or at the bottom of a hill that also provide relaxing areas in the middle of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelto12345
50,Great View,Lots of great trails and one of the best places to view the Los Angeles skyline with the San Gabriel Mountains in the background. Especially nice on clear winter days with some snow on the peaks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjaminm404
40,Nice park in urban setting,"Very pretty park with fitness trails right in the city. Stay on paved trails or strike off on something more rustic. Pretty duckpond, play equipment, benches, picnic areas. $5 per car on weekends, but weekdays are free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
50,Well Worth the Visit,"Parking is free during the weekdays. However, upon entering the park on weekends or holidays, there is a $6.00 fee. The park offers many amenities for children and adults amid its shade trees and manicured grass such as ball fields and play and picnic areas. There is also a lovely fishing pond and a building for community meetings. There is a very steep hill which is good for hiking and ample other areas for jogging and exercise. At the very top area of the park, there are several pieces of built-in outdoor exercise equipment and some amazing views of the city. A day at this park is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
50,Great Park!,"I love this park, great quick hike, nothing too strenuous, but you feel like you got a quick workout. Bring good shoes, some of the paths are mountainous, not paved.They've now got restroom facilities at the top of the grassy knoll.The water lilies are in bloom right now in the japanese garden area.Its a great park, has huge grassy area at the top. Mountainous hiking. Babbling brook and small lake. Playground.They've got plenty of parking, but be careful since they lock down the parking facilities at sunset year-round and your car will be locked in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmorodomi
40,Becoming a true LA gem,"I first went to this park when it first opened many years ago. It wasn't much back then, and I ignored it for a long time. I recently went with my daughter and her husband and was astounded at the changes, all for the better. The park is built on old oil fields and keeps growing as the old wells are shut down and cleaned up. The land is returned to the community and the park grows. It's not a world class park yet but it's on it's way if public officials keep it moving forward. It could rival Griffith Park in the future. It has very nice hiking trails and some nice gardens. There are also kids' places and a fishing pond. Most of all it has spectacular views of Los Angeles. I think this will be added to my regular haunts from now on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321timothys
50,I love this park! It's great for everyone!,I have been coming to Kenneth Hahn since I was a little girl and surprisingly so did my husband. This park has been growing along with us. Now we love to go for a hike or a run in the mornings and enjoy the city view or waterfall. Sometimes we even go for a picnic by the Japanese Garden. It's just a lovely place for everyone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanias598
50,"Beautiful, historical, and nice easy walk","I have visited this lovely area several times now, and enjoy the walk each time. My favorite area is the area devoted to the Olympics. This site was home to the athletes, as I understand it,and possibly some of the events in the 1932 Olympics, where they were held in Los Angeles. When the Olympics returned to Los Angeles in 1984, trees were planted here to honor the countries and athletes from the 1932 games. The trail is easy to do, and beautiful.There are many other areas, with a children's playground and picnic tables. It's hard to imagine that a bustling city exists just beyond the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/portergirlbooks
50,Great local beginners Hike!,Kenneth Hahn Park trail was perfect for a beginning hiker like myself. Views of the city at the top are awesome. Got there a little after 8am and passed maybe 3-4 other people on the trail. Definitely nice if you don't like crowded trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310dini
50,Grassy oasis and workout spot in the heart of LA,"This lovely park is located minutes from the airport and the 10 freeway. Quite easy to find and park, there is enough wildlife in the lakes that the Audobon society has a free outing there on the 3rd Saturday of the month. We did a nice 3+ mile loop that included a big hill to get the heart rate up and a more mellow walk around the remains of a reservoir. Further on the path were a few nature hikes through brush and a fitness circuit of machines which feature ingenious ways to work muscles using body weight. The park also has several playgrounds for kids and a community center in addition to several pretty man made streams and lakes. It was a safe way to get an outdoors workout in a nice enviroment with good views of downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamarG_12
50,Huge LA Park That is Growing,"This park is huge, and will grow as the oil land is reclaimed.Several great kid play areas, nice duck pond, lots of trails. Lots of gazebo and BBQ picnic options scattered around the park.Parking is completely free during the week, but they do charge $6 on weekends. If you want to avoid paying on weekends, look at google maps and you'll find a neighborhood nearby with ample street parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geterd0ne
