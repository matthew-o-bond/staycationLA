30,Good location,"The Theater: It is located inside LACMA, near the bookstore and cafe. It is mid-size theater. There is enough leg room. The sound effects are okay. Love the location because can hang out at the courtyard or garden area before or after the performance.The Parking: LACMA parking lot $12. Private lot across street (on Wilshire Blvd, $12). Street metered parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ILoveFoodComa
