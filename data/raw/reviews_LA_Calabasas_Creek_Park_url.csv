40,A nice Little Historical Park in Calabasas,"A beautiful park to explore right in downtown Calabasas. It is actually owned and maintained by the Leonis Adobe Museum, just two doors down. I had been going there for years, but just ventured to the park for the first time. I go with my toddler, and he LOVES water falls and water fountains and this place has both! There is a giant water fountain just on the other side of the giant gate. There are many cool things to see here. The Duck Pond, Chumash Village and Calabasas Jail are some of the highlights. I wish there was a playground, but that's not what they do here (yet at least). But other than that, it's a lovely place to take young children (or even a date I was guess) for a nice little stroll. In fact, I bet if you enjoy a date at the nearby Peddler's Fork or Sagebrush Cantina, this would make for a lovely after dinner stroll!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
