50,Brilliant public art,It’s a phenomenal piece of public art at the entrance to the Chiat-Day block that in fact it is known colloquially as the Binoculars Building.Unsurprisingly Frank Gehry was the architect and completion was in the early 2000s. Entrance to the car park and for pedestrians is between the lenses.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia

40,Gehry in Venice ...,"We've always loved the ""distinctly Frank"" architecture of the Chiat-Day since it was first built, and still enjoy driving by or walking by during the annual Venice Art Walk. Most catching is the Claes Oldenburg huge binoculars - they are a Wow factor. We walked around the outside as there are no interior tours. Enjoy the sight! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
