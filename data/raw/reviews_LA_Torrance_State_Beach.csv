50,A great beach at the end of the road...,"Torrance Beach is super nice, especially in the summer when its warm. Its family friendly, life guards are on duty, and the water is pretty kid friendly as well. This beach is a favorite among locals and visitors alike. There is plenty of parking in the lot as well as side streets. Definitely a nice place to spend the day at the beach!",Kelby B
50,Very easy & pleasant beach experience,"I had part of a Saturday free while doing other things in Los Angeles and wanted to get a quick and easy ""beach fix."" Torrance beach was perfect for this. Parking was close, plentiful and inexpensive ($7 for the whole day). Even on a beautiful Saturday (11:00-2:00) the beach was not crowded and mostly populated by families. It is an amazingly clean beach, with very little seaweed (also very few shells). Within a ten minute walk is Riviera Village with lots of options for lunch or a quick snack. It was a great way for me to get some strolling beach time in with little fuss.",KatrinaPa
40,Nice Beach at End of the Strand,"Has a large flat rate ($7) parking lot with a short walk to the sand. Recently went on a summer Saturday and the lot was wide open at noon, but filled up around 2pm. Not nearly as crowded as Santa Monica or Venice. Bathroom and outdoor showers available. I think there is also a food vendor, but most people either picnic or hike a couple blocks to Riviera Village. Keep an eye out for dolphins.",KirkRB
50,The Best of the LA Beach Options for Families,"Torrance State Beach is great for families! The location is a little less busy and there is ample parking that is a flat fee for the day, no hiking back to your car to feed a meter. There are concrete ramps and walkways to reach the beach and yet the beach is still very deep. The water is cold, as is always the water in the Pacific, but not so cold we could not enjoy it in August. No seashells to speak of, but no sealife around your feet either for those squeamish about that. LOTS of seaweed but they float in large clumps so they are easy to avoid. Plenty of lifeguard stands, bathrooms and a small refreshment stand. No hassling by beach vendors either. A great beach to visit with family,",BeadedWhimsy
40,Great Beach with terrible parking,"Love this clean and easy to walk beach a bit out of L.A. We went on a weekend so the crowds were the highest, but the beach did not feel crowded at all!

50,Glad the rest of the World doesn't know,"I am blessed to be able to walk to this beach. It has me spoiled as when I travel I find few places, except for maybe the beautiful blue water and white sands of tropical beaches, that compare with this expanse of uncrowded and unspoiled beach. It is set against the Palos Verdes Hillside. One can see the waves breaking and occasional dolphins playing in the surf. There is a paved walkway next to the sand as well as an upper walkway. The start of the bike trail to Santa Monica starts here. The sunset is stellar! As I said, we are blessed!",luv2trvlRedondoBeach

It is great if you want to shop, but not if you want to enjoy the beach.",Heidi H
40,"Nice Beach, Gorgeous Views","Torrance beach offers clean, local beach area that is well kept and mostly visited by locals who appreciate what they have in the beach. The views of Palos Verdes are terrific and on a clear day, you may be able to catch a glimpse of Catalna Island.

There are two walking paths, an upper one that is next to the street/parking with breath taking views, and the lower one that parallels the upper one. If you are riding your bike or rollerblading or skate boarding, the lower one is more conducive since there is more room and it's wider. There's plenty of parking--on the street there are meters that use coins (25c for 10 mins) or the parking lot is $3/day. There are many volleyball nets and restrooms, and a few food stands. There are life guard there during the daylight hours. You can park and walk to the Redondo Beach Pier for more fun and attractions. This is a great family venue.",Kent S

Plus it's a spacious lot, unlike some other crowded and stressful lots of la.The beach itself is extremely clean and usually not overly crowded as it's not one of the ""touristy"" beaches. The view is incredible, to one side the hills and rocky coast view of Palos Verdes and to the other side the city and curving coast line. The sand is soft, not overly rocky, and the water isn't too cold, in the spring and summer months. I dove right in and had a great time walking up and down this coast. There are several manned life guard towers across the beach and even a small café. If you are looking for a peaceful beach day, to lounge, tan, jump in the ocean and play in the sand, this beach is great. Kid and family friendly, but also good for couples and friends.

With a five minute walk to beach. We stayed up on the road in between the dolphin park and redondo beach pier. From here we got to see both fireworks. It was cold and overcast. But it all seemed to work out. I would recommend getting there early and parking a car there. It would have been nice to wait in the car and watch from the back of a truck. We brought beach chairs and blankets. We were fine. Weve been on the beach and further towards dolphin park. I beleive this is the best spot.,Brad A

Amazing sunsets!",smph5
50,Favorite South Bay Beach!,"Every beach in the South Bay is really great but this one (we affectionately call RAT Beach because it is where Redondo And Torrance meet), is truly special because of:1) You see dolphins jumping around every early morning around 6:30/72) Unlike the other South Bay beaches, you are virtually guaranteed a parking spot on any day, any time. Just remember to feed the meters!3) Bathrooms here are better than at most parks and beaches",abfromsouthbay

I love the quietness of this beach, how the houses are across the street rather than right AT the beach, the paved walk is great, plenty of bathrooms along the way, a lot of people exercising or just talking, Rubys diner is right at the beach and fun, there is a ""water park"" of sorts for little kids to have safe water play, drive up Rancho Palos Verdes hill that you see here, my FAV Starbucks is at the top of the hill with a beautiful patio and view. Nearby, Redondo BEach downtown is quaint and more accessible than Manhattan Beach's - this area is where I hope to retire in 5 years by renting a room in someone's house or condo!!!",ronniwho
40,Nice beach,Clean beach. Local surfers spot. Bring food restaurants are a ways away. Plenty of parking. Its a little hike down to the beach and then back up to parking. Usually not crowded. Decent surf most of the time,Jud J
30,Decent beach,This is a busy beach even in the winter. It has a snack bar which nice and plenty of parking. The sand is kept clean. The drawback would be the metered parking is expensive.,michael b
50,Actually more beautiful than the Bay of Nice!,"Only now in my middle age have I realized that this beach and this California South Bay are absolutely stunningly beautiful. Having traveled a great deal now, I can affirm that this Torrance Beach, its lovely wide white smooth sand, and its spectacular curving view of the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the bay, are actually more beautiful than the setting one finds in Nice, France. Paradise-in-your-own-back-yard sort of discovery. It was there all along! Glad I have finally realized this.",KimberlyLabor
40,Nice beach,"The restrooms were out of order and replaced by portacabins. Those were dirty but I guess that's normal. Other then that, nice beach.",c n
40,Lots of Parking & a Snack Shop,"One perk of this beach is that there is lots of parking. Parking costs vary, depending on the time of the week, so look into that if you want to save some cash.There's a snack bar at the end, before it turns in to Palos Verdes, so that's a nice perk. There's also some seating in front of the snack shack.It has clean bathroom and showers, as long as guests respect them.It's a long walk from the parking lot to the sand, so my kids and I usually go to a shorter beach.If the tide is low, you can walk to the Palos Verdes end and see some sea life among the rocks!",LivPurple
40,Nice Beach,"Nice clean beach with lots of things to do i.e. volleyball, surfing, swimming, bike riding etc. Must visit it the pier too, there are lots of shops and restaurants",Nattysimps
50,One of the best beaches around,"Always liked going to the Torrance beach. Plenty of parking, though these days you have to pay for it, and a good family atmosphere.",UltimateWines
40,A great family beach,You can park on the Esplanade but bring money or a card for the meters. There is a parking lot on the South end of the Esplanade but it fills up early. There are bathrooms and lifeguards. The stairs down to the beach and back up are VERY steep so keep that in mind for anyone who can't do a lot of stairs. The waves are usually mid size and there are sting rays and jelly fish at times. Lifeguards are there too. Not much around to buy food unless you want a long walk to Riviera Village or Redondo Pier. I wouldn't leave valuables on the beach unattended. This is the South Bay but it's still Los Angeles.,JuliK222
50,Very interesting,"We visited family that lived in Torrance in 1978 and again in 1980 loved Redondo Beach Pier back than. That Pier had to be replaced after being washed to sea. Loved the trip to Beverly Hills,Hollywood, Disneyland,Knottsberry Farm,Wax Museum,Las Vegas. Family made our trip out West fantastic.",dskeens
50,Beautiful beach,"Torrance state Beach is a beautiful strand of Beach and fitness path that starts next to Redondo Beach and the pier. For years I'd thought it was still Redondo Beach. The way the beaches line up its not readily easy to tell where one ends and the next begins. For visitors to the area this set of beaches begins to the north with Dockweiler Beach in Playa del Rey. Its the closest Beach to LAX and is in the flight path of jets taking off and landing. Manhattan Beach is next door, then Hermosa Beach, next Redondo Beach, then Torrance state Beach ending at the base of Palos Verde with the little known (and not exactly alluring name) ""Rat Beach"". Don't worry though, R.AT. is only an acronym for ""Right After Torrance"" Beach. Hermosa literally means ""beautiful"" but they're really all beautiful beaches and unique in their own way. I personally love the stretch of Torrance state Beach with its view of the nearby Hills of Palos Verde Estates.",0221Serendipity
50,Good,Nice beach - good for beach runs and cycling (dedicated paths for it). Water appeared clean and warm. Volleyball courts available.,Monkeyzoe
40,Great Family Beach with Really Good Beach Cafe,"Visited here on the 4th of July. There is a lot, but it filled quickly. Look for street parking in the neighborhoods near the beach. Great sandy beach with a nice view of Palos Verdes. Lots of families and kids boogie boarding. Bathrooms were OK, fairly clean for public beach bathrooms, but bring tissues or some TP as it ran out and was not replaced that promptly. No tacky beach shops near this end of the beach, which was nice (in fact, no shops at all).Beach café had GREAT food!! Not at all the usual junk! Tasty, absolutely delicious chicken Milanese sandwich on a high quality roll (dense and chewy inside, well-toasted outside) and fresh, handmade potato chips. Kudos to the people in the kitchen there!",BooKat
30,Good for kids,"Clean beach, but can get very crowded on summer weekends. Parking is very challenging here, as it is along most of the South Bay's beaches. This is a good place if you have kids, though, because there's a snack bar here, restrooms, and the main lifeguard station for the area. This is also the southern terminus for the bike path that runs at least up to Manhattan Beach or El Segundo.",Eucalyptus_101
40,Little Known Beach,"Great beach at the end of the coastal bike path that's low key, much better parking and between two good surfing spots, plus has great surfing of it's own. Snack bar, bathrooms, pretty, clean, not crowded-excellent!",Av8trx90277
30,Average of local beach benchmark. However its like home for me..,"I used to go the the beach for as shortest time I ve spent there while visiting my ex girlfriend. Althought the look and environment is no great deal, its still beautifull the ocean view, the skyline with all the little villas in the back of the beach...That all being said it is still home for me. So I can t say I am a very independent certifier of this area. I love it I miss it!!!",faracer
40,Torrance Beach,"A great place to walk, body surf, boogie board and find seashells. I have lots of wonderful memories of walks here with my Aunt and Uncle. This is where my Uncle likes to body surf.",Soulmates2012
40,relaxing and low keyed,I frequently visited this beach early in the morning 7ish and stare the vastness of the ocean. I have enjoyed watching the waves and dolphins swim and play. Good place to ran on short distance of 1 mile.,N3371E
40,Another nice beach to visit,I also enjoyed this beach as well if you want another nice beach to go to this is also the one if you want to listen to the waves as well as have some wonderful time to yourself and to if the weather is warm enough to also go for a swim. Torrance state beach is the one for you.,Jeff B
50,"RAT Beach, Right After Torrance",Everything one can ask for in a beach. Uncrowded. fine sand and sun. This is my favorite stumping grounds.,Nate090
30,decent southbay beach,"cool to lay out, surf can be good but rarely is it not walled and the water has a lot of weeds due to P.V",idlehands26
40,Awesome Place to take a long walk to the Edge of South Bay,"End of The bike. Continues solitude ,romance and adventures await.Great place to meditate I recommend Low tode",Victoria K
40,A very peacful place in the big city,"It takes some effort to get here. But you will forget it is part of metro area with 6 millions people. Come to watch the sunset. There are plenty of parking along the beach. You can play volley ball or surf. Bike trail start or end here. There are showers all along the way. Try to bring your date here at night, prefer in the summer, take a walk in the moon light covered beach is very cool.",monkey451129
40,Very Safe and Fun,This beach is a little walk down from parking and there is normally lots of parking. Lots of life guards and just great for the family. The sand is some of the best and the waves are good for surfers but still safe for the little ones. Just a fun beach but it does get crowded so get here early and enjoy.,kevin p
50,Pretty Miramar Park & Beautiful Torrance Beach,"We had a seaside sunset Memorial service here for my son who recently passed away on a recent Saturday evening. It was beautiful, peaceful and just the perfect place to give him back to the Pacific Ocean to eternally rest. We couldn't have chosen a more perfect place.",JNP-PassportsReady
50,Another great Beach,"If you want to go to another Beach and if you are in the Torrance area Torrance state Beach is for you it is very nice pleasant as well as a relaxing place to go swim and so forth. So if you are in Torrance, This beach is for you.",happyjeff56
40,"nice and clean, pretty scenic","It's really pretty here. Not touristy, great views of PV. Lots of families, great sunsets. It's a good place to swim and relax.",Aqua1822
50,Peaceful and beautiful beach,"Every time we visit family in Los Angels, this is the beach we go to. It's not as busy as Redondo or Hermosa beach. It's quite and peaceful. There is a lot of seaweeds on the beach but we just ignore it. There's free street parking and plenty of paid parking. ($3 during the week and $7 during weekend day time.)",kimiec
50,Good for ordering pizza and watching sunset!,"At the Torrance Beach, on Friday night, one can pick up a pizza and a couple of beers, and cruise over to the Torrance Beach and watch the sun go down for a great way to ease on into the weekend. If you stay in the car, the parking enforcement will leave you alone. Otherwise, it only costs a couple of quarters.",Dayla S
40,"Greek Isle Views, Surfers,Dolphins","Torrance Beach is tucked away at the base of Palos Verdes Peninsula at the southern end of Santa Monica Bay. Looking up at the red tiled roofs and colors of PV from the beach is like looking at a Greek Isle.You always see surfers here and often see dolphins in pods on winter and spring mornings in particular. The beach has a ramp suitable for strollers and universal access.If you head south, the sandy beach runs into rocks below the cliffs, so walking toward PV means scrambling unless you climb the path up to the top.In the other direction toward Redondo Pier, there is a wonderful bluff top walkway that is dog friendly with a corresponding no pets allowed walking trail and a designated bike trail on the beach itself. Starting from Torrance Beach and walking north, the Redondo Peir is three to four miles round trip depending on how far you go. There are no restaurants per se on the beach--you have to walk a couple of blocks inland to find them--but some sidewalk vendors sell drinks and snack items almost year round and you can stop at the pier.There is a large parking lot at Torrance Beach plus lots of metered street parking, with free parking on side streets available at non-peak times. I like the beach best in the winter months when it is less crowded;however, on weekends the paths are always full of walkers and bicyclists. It is a beautiful stretch of the California coast.",Susanwt
50,Great spot to go night fishing and hang with friends,Good fishing for skate sharks and rays at night if the seaweed is not to bad. Sunset is nice and just a good lace to catch up with friends.,Timothy H
50,the mellow end of the beach mostly surfers,same great beach as Redondo but a little quieter and a great place to watch the surfers practice.,SmilinBobby
50,My wife and I visited Torrance Beach 3...,"My wife and I visited Torrance Beach 3 times on our visit to the area. The beach is at the end of Redondo Beach, but we found this end of the beach to be the best. We were fortunate enough to see wild dolphins close to the beach as well as lots of sea birds. There are plenty of rest rooms and a great sandy beach. The area also feels extremely safe especially at night.",PJH67
