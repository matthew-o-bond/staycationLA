50,Mishe Mokwa to Backbone Trail Loop. Excellent,"If you are looking for a longish hike with varied and beautiful views, this is for you.What to know:I'm 50 and in moderately good shape.The high was 65 and breezy with some cloud cover.I did it in running shoes, shorts and added and removed a layer several times mostly due to the wind. Several times I wished for light hiking boots but was fine with a little more attention to foot placement.Take plenty of water and snacks.The 6+ miles took 4.5 hours from start to finishIt is a beautiful walk with lots of variation from plants to high peaks and outcroppings to see. Every few hundred yards there is a new vista. About 20% of this walk is shaded if you start at 8AM as I did. Still, you are exposed a lot so sunblock is important.Most of the trails have a narrow gravel/rock free lane. However, you will definitely deal with some unsure footing along the way.Split Rock and Balance Rock are two different things. If you are up for something a little more technical (but totally do-able), cut off the trail to Balance Rock. It is the best thing on the trail. It will be a 45 minute diversion.I added a few hints on the attached image. Enjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todwith1d
50,A great afternoon to see th e sights and get exercise!,"Spent the afternoon hiking up to the top of a mountain and relished the views of LA, Santa Monica, and Malibu. Not for the casual walker, these hills can be quite steep. The trip to the top is worth it but be aware that the trip downhill can be equally taxing on your knees. Enjoy the beauty nature has to offer!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dadof2inBRU
50,Great views.,We did the Mishe Mokwa trail and backbone trail. It was close to 8 miles and 75 floors according to my iPhone app. Great view from the top.

50,Awesome views,I have been staying in Laurel canyon and sad to say it is now part of the automotive rat race that has consumed LA. For better and less crowded driving head to the canyons out of Malibu. If you are one who enjoys driving around to see new vistas the canyons in these mountains will not disappoint. Discovered a community in Topanga canyon that seems to have an artsy/hippie(?) type. Following Mulholand Drive is another fine way to see the best of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
50,Great area,"Having visited the Sequoia, the Kings canyon and Yosemite earlier on that week, I must say I was also impressed with these mountains.We really enjoyed mainly the drive from the Big sur and coming down onto Santa Barbara, then Malibu, reaching Santa Monica and nothing let us down. Great drive with the mountains on the left as you reach Malibu, with Getty's villa domineering the cliff and the ocean on the right. You have some amazing houses on the cliffs and I am sure hiking inland would not disappoint either.We surely want to come back, stay in this area and maybe do some hiking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TERRAvelista
30,Pretty Good Temescal Canyon Loop,"First of all, this is L.A., not Yosemite, so keep your expectations mild. You'll get ocean views from this hike, but also lots of homes, and urban smogscapes. This trail is far gentler on the up slope than its companion ridge trail. And it passes a seasonal waterfall. Your best access is off of Sunset and Temescal Canyon but, if you are driving in, bypass the first two lefts and head for the back parking. Also, be aware that you are expected to pay a $10 fee. If you start here, rather than at the first lots, you'll be able to follow the signage and not wander off on one of the many spur trails. Like I said, the trail is only of moderate stress, but the views don't open until you're nearly to the ridge. Once there you can hike a much longer distance up top. At least get to Skull Rock and, perhaps, farther. Maybe try a spur to a higher ridge line. There is a back way down, but you'll be miles away from your parking. So I advise returning back to the ridge junction and hike down the ridge trail. Here, the views are continual and you probably won't be much impacted on the downhill trek; though the people hiking up this way most probably will. By the way, I didn't drive here. Both the # 2 Metro and 9 Big Blue buses stop in front of the parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti

50,Sandstone Peak - Mt. Allen,"This hike is close to the Malibu beaches. It's about a 20 minute drive up to the trailhead on Yerba Beuno road. They say its the highest point in Los Angeles County (about 3200 feet). There is free parking and a porta-potty at the trailhead. Once you reach the top, the views are spectacular in all directions.However, the trail has been severly rutted by the spring rains. They have filled in most of the ruts with loose rock - which makes for an uncomfortable hike in sandals or Keens. Best to have actual hiking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwkruz

Hiking on the trails of Santa Monica Mountains is a great way to start the day, and an even better reason to head to either Santa Monica or Malibu for a post hike brunch/lunch.The reward is making it to the top or hitting your goal for the day, but the views overlooking the ocean, and parts of LA are truly incredible as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sethdanielgoldman

50,Come for spring bloom,"I stayed at Sycamore canyon campground and spent one day hiking a loop north of it. It was late March, about +20C and sunny, and the views were breathtaking. There is a nice observation point up and to the West of the campground, looking over the beach and the ocean. Further inland one finds beatiful mountain landscapes. And at this time of year the wild flowers were in full bloom, covering some slopes in natural flowerbeds from top to bottom, and only bright pinpricks in other places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helgie8888

50,Trail through history,"What a unique and beautiful place and experience! The landscape of sagebrush, native wildflowers, ancient oaks, and majestic rock formations are a one of a kind. The whole area is clean, but not altered. You have the feeling that the native Americans that walked those trails hundreds of years ago would look pretty much the same. The location has been preserved, and yet has the modern convenience of a bathroom at the entrance. The rangers who you might see from time to time are friendly, knowledgeable, and have a passion for what they do. To me the land has always seemed magical from the first time I visited it through Audubon Society many years ago. Great place to take family, whether another 2-legged, or 4-legged companion because you can get a nice work out, but not over stenuous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilbyh

50,Mishe Mokwa Trail and Sandstone Peak - great hike,"We did this wonderful hike in the Santa Monica mountains on a hot Friday; we set off around 11 am or so and there weren't too many people on the trail. It's not a difficult hike, and took us about 3 - 3.5 hours. Starting at the Sandstone Peak trailhead, we turned right at the fork and did the Mishe Mokwa trail first, which meets up with the Backbone Trail to form a loop back to the trailhead. The Backbone Trail takes you to Sandstone Peak, the highest point in the Santa Monica mountains with spectacular views. There's a little box at Sandstone Peak with a visitor log in it for hikers to sign. Going this direction, counter clockwise, means a more gradual ascent to the high point.The trail map can be found on the NPS website under Circle X Ranch.Highway 23 through the mountains is very twisty! The first time we drove it, going from Westlake Village to Zuma Beach, we went a bit too fast and my head was spinning by the end. Second time we took it a bit slower!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vagabond_dreams

The location is just off Pacific Coast Highway up Sunset Blvd, on 566 Los Liones Dr, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272. I suggest getting there early for closest free street parking. We arrived at 9:15 and parked pretty close to the trail head. Drive up the hill until you see the Church on your left. Bring water and a camera. Not a difficult hike. The trail is fairly long so you can choose your distance. Great views of coast, Catalina, the City Downtown and surrounding Mountains.

Kanan Road winds thru the hills from Agoura Hills to Malibu & Zuma Beach. Lots of walking & hiking paths and view pull off spots along the way. Malibu Canyon Rd. runs from Las Verginas to Pacific Coast Hwy with walking, hicking trails along a beautiful drive thru the Santa Monica Mountains to Malibu and the Pepperdine university and great shops & restaurants in Malibu.

40,Amazing views on the Mishe Mokwa Trail!,"I've always thought the Santa Monica Mountains were kinda blah....Solstice Canyon being totally trashed w/graffiti, trash, and random parties going on w/loud music around the ruins....although it does offer nice ocean views, it just felt like any other ""city hike."" Boy was I WRONG though. The Mishe Mokwa Trail to Sandstone Peak is absolutely GORGEOUS! The road to get to the trailhead is pretty gnarly and narrow so if you're not used to mountain driving it may bring some sweat to your hands & a faster heart rate. I've tried getting there from both PCH & the freeway, and both are gnarly. The parking lot is very easy to find as there is a fairly large sign that says ""Sandstone Peak Trailhead."" Pit toilets are available at the parking lot. This trail is quite busy during the weekend but has way less traffic on the weekdays.After climbing a little less than 0.5 miles, the trail splits: making a right will take you to the Mishe Mokwa trail (longer but gradual incline) and making a left will take you to Sandstone Peak (shorter & steeper grade). I always make a right and follow the Mishe Mokwa trail and do a loop. Doing the loop is about 6.5 to 7 miles, depending on which places you decide to visit. I DEFINITELY recommend doing the Mishe Mokwa trail instead of going directly to Sandstone Peak since you will be missing out on SO much beautiful scenery! You will have a chance to see Split Rock, have the option to go visit the Balancing Rock, and also have the opportunity to check out Tri Peaks. Inspiration Point is another beautiful stop before reaching Sandstone Peak. It's not as crowded as Sandstone Peak and yet has the 360 view of the surrounding area. Highly recommend stopping here.Lots of solitude if you can come during the weekdays. The trail is fairly exposed so I probably wouldn't do this in hot weather. The terrain is very rugged in certain sections with lots of loose rocks...not the best trail when you have an IT band and ankle problem. Coming down from Sandstone Peak to the main trail may be a challenge if you don't have shoes with good traction.Total Miles - 7.1 miles (stopping by Tri-Peaks)Total Elevation - 1,621 ftAdventure Pass is not required to park.

It's beautiful and breezy.Take a lot of water to drink and maybe rinse off a bit once you reach the top, and a picnic lunch, something to sit on, bug spray, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat..... to be safe maybe take pepper spray or something to scare a mountain lion away?Stuff does happen, although not often. Don't hike down after dark!Watch for animals, there have been a few issues but there weren't any problems where we were.

Although sneakers are ok, it is more stable with some sort of light hiking sandal or shoe.The other interesting fact is that the mountain lion population has grown somewhat with the addition of two baby kittens.

30,Good for weekend hike,"We didn't do much research before our trip and we ended up on road for almost five hours instead of 1 hour as expected. You might want to check those marathon events as it will seriously make you stuck in traffic for ungodly hours.There are too many things to do here, do your own research. We hiked until we saw the Balanced Rock. It was nice but don't expect to be like those fancy rocks in Utah or Arizona.Note to parents with young children, the roads are winding and lots of challenging turnings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manau-panau
50,"Great roads, lots of ""twistys""","On any given day, especially a warm sunny day you will find people on the back roads, bicycling, driving, riding. Fun roads, lots of challenging turns, not for the faint of heart. In addition, the vistas of the Pacific Ocean epitomize why we live in Southern California. One highlight, ""The Snake"" where on the weekends a photographer posts up and catches people driving, riding, bicycling even skateboarding and you can purchase the digital photo on line for a nominal price. Lots of fun! Then when you are tired of driving, there are plenty of quaint places to eat and take a break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/879loria
40,Love the Trails and Geology,"There is too much here to lump the Santa Monica Mountains into one Review.. The question is what are you trying to do here, and what do you want to experience.. There is something here for everyone. If you want to have a smoothie at quarky restaurant in Topanga, you can do that, and have fun looking at the trees, and the steep canyons.. If you are looking for amazing sedimentary rock formations, from sandstone to conglomerates, etc... You can experience this too. If you are looking hiking trails, there are lots.. There aren't many that don't have views of housing projects, which is one of the downsides, but that is okay...The Santa Monica Mountains are part of the Transverse Range, which is an East-West trending mountain Range, and an Ancient part of the Sierra Nevada Batholith before being torn from that range by the Garlock Fault and ultimately the San Andreas Fault. The Santa Monica mountains are mostly sedimentary rocks, and mostly Oak Woodlands.. There a few pines here, but no pine forests. The altitude of the mountains are too low for sustained pine forests.There are many ways to access these mountains, from the many canyons accessed from the South, and West and North, you can enter the mountains. Beautiful green and lush oak forests on the coast to the drier oak forests more inland.Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast
50,Temescal Canyon Gateway Trails,"We did not do much research or planning prior to our trip about which trails to hike or how to get to the best places in the Santa Monica Mountains, however had a great experience by just using the public transit to get us to the base of the Temescal Canyon Gateway Trails. We did not have a car, so this would be a great option for you if transportation is limited. We were able to take a very cheap bus fare ($2) in the morning out past Malibu (it was fairly quick as well for being in the LA area). It dropped us off right near the entrance of the trails. Hiking was free, as you enter it appears as a camp with log cabins and as you walk through this area you will come to a few different trail options. We just chose one and were not disappointed. We got some pretty great views of the coast. The terrain was decent, however tennis shoes are definitely necessary. We also saw a lot of hikers on the path with dogs on leashes, which is also a plus for pet-owners. Definitely worth the views near the top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184haller
50,"If you just want to get away, try the Santa Monica Mountains","Great place to hike all day, or walk with friends, or just by yourself.Be sure to bring and wear sunscreen, a hat, and water. One can access how to get here via Google Maps. Look up Westridge Rd in Mandeville Canyon. Take this road all the way to the end. You can park in the neighborhood and start hiking on Mandeville Fireroad. If you take this road to the end you the. Turn left on dirt Mullholland and access any number of other marked fire trails like Eagle Rock and such. The hike up to dirt Mulholland is a 700 foot elevation climb for 3.7 miles according to a Garman GPS Unit.If you car to complete this or more, may I also suggest bringing food as well.Dogs are common and friendly so if you bring yours, wear a camelbak so you will have enough water for you and your dog.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652bobp

30,Circle X Ranch — a drive warning,"This is a ""lovely when you get there"" but a bear to reach destination.It was a 20-minute winding canyon road UP. It's wide enough to not be nervous in the face of oncoming traffic, not terribly steep or treacherous, either. However, it's a very stressful winding climb in any car.My jaw was tight after the constant zig-zagging route up. The same trip down was staring into the sun. I got quite a stress headache — not the desired outcome on an outdoor hike in the canyon.The top has parking, a restroom, picnic tables and a commemoration with a flag. It's often used for Boy Scouts.My friend took a lovely 2-hour trail and said it was quite steep. I enjoyed the quiet time sitting and decompressing from the journey up. I'd require the same (and a drink) after we drove down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelredcard

Gorgeous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Milwaukee6567
50,"Many Options, Worth the Effort","As the signs along the road say, Los Angeles is the only major city in the world bisected by a mountain range, which, of course, affords visitors some pretty spectacular views when the weather is clear. Although Mulholland Drive is the main artery through the city, many side routes open up the further west you follow the mountains toward the ocean, so you want to plan ahead to prevent taking wrong exits and roads to nowhere.Mulholland Drive east into LA is curvy and the driver has to remain alert; however, there are several pullouts (each with very limited parking), and the uniqueness of the location and views make this a must-do experience if you have the time. All of the names and locations you have always heard mentioned on television are here, and the trip gives first-time visitors a chance to put them all together.We chose to drive a loop that took us 4-5 hours from Santa Monica, to Mulholland Drive, through Malibu Canyon, past Pepperdine University, up to Carrillo Beach State Beach, along the Malibu coast and back to Santa Monica. Here is our route: Starting from the Santa Monica pier area, we took I-10 to 405, and followed the 405 north to exit 61.where we connected with Mulholland drive and followed it east to 101. We took 101 north and west to Topanga Canyon Road, which we followed a short distance to Mulholland Hwy west (different than Mulholland Road). We drove Mulholland Hwy to Malibu Canyon Road, which brought us out on CA 1 (Pacific Coast Hwy) at Pepperdine University. 15 minutes north on CA 1 is Carrillo State Beach, which provides a rocky coastline similar to what you might see further north near Monterey/Carmel. From Carrillo Beach we turned back south and followed CA 1 along the coast through Malibu back to Santa Monica. A fun adventure for those who like to do their own thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westsidecouple

50,Some of the Best Hiking Views in the World,"The following statement may surprise you. The Santa Monica Mountains overlooking LA are home to some of the most visually stunning hikes anywhere in the world. This judgment comes from someone who has hiked all over the world, including the Scottish Highlands, Hawaii, the Rockies, the Alps, the Himalaya and the Karakorum. I had no idea you could even hike right on the outskirts of this big city until a friend I was visiting turned me on to these. A whole series of hikes lead up from the west side of LA into these mountains providing incredible views of the coastline all the way from Santa Monica to Palos Verdes and inland to downtown LA and the San Gabriels. On a clear day Catalina Island is clearly in view. Two of the best hikes are through Temescal Canyon and to the old Nike missile station along Westridge. Los Liones is another. The views from many viewpoints along the way on each of these hikes are the equal of any in the world, believe me. The trails themselves are well maintained and easy on your legs. No rocky terrain, just smooth going underfoot. So if you live in the area or are just visiting LA and love to hike, head here. You will not be disappointed. Nor will forget the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmgradon

50,Beautiful Land,"The hiking trails in the Santa Monica Mountains range from easy to hard, from short strolls to endurance hikes. You have to keep an eye out for rattlesnakes, but I hiked here for twenty years and have never been bitten. The land is lovely, oaks and eucalyptus, sage and manzanitas. Wildlife viewing is great: coyotes, foxes, raccoons, Bobcats. In the summer hike early because the afternoon sun is scorching in the canyons. A seasonal stream runs in the Topanga hiking area when there is not a drought which is very pretty. Watch out for poison oak near the streams. A peaceful place to strengthen your body and calm your mind, deep soul nourishment for wanderers and hikers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276valeriew

Went North on Topanga Canyon Road, to 101 W, to Malibu Canyon Dr S, which takes you back to the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Headed a little further north on the PCH and stopped at Paradise Cove for a great lunch. The Paradis Cove Cafe is right on the beach. You can eat inside or out.

There was only a trickle of water today due to the drought but worth the time. The trail head is off Winding Way road just off PCH. There is a small free parking lot or street parking along PCH. It is about 3 miles round trip. Allow about 2 hours. A great way ton get some exercise and see the SM moutains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family0f6traveler

40,great trail system,"I have been using the series of trails for years. There are all types of terrain for a variety of interests and fitness levels. The views from certain sections are great with views of the Pacific. It is possible to hit the same or different paths and see new items every time. However , a couple of important points.For some reason there are dog owners who think it is a cool to leave their dogs off lease and roam on their own. This is not a good idea or safe. Dogs can get lost, get hurt and create a waste nuisance on the trails. These owners rarely pick up after their dogs.Also some dogs are frightening to people. Seeing a dog off leash can be scary for some and even dangerous. I have witnessed this several times where a unleashed dog threatens people or another dog.It is also against the law to have an untethered dog in the mountains.Be considerate about this and do not leave your dog running around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379

50,Take a scenic drive on Mulholland Highway!,"I'm from the mountains of Tennessee, so being able to see the mountains of California was wonderful. They are unique and beautiful in their own way. The mountains are great to see as a backdrop while on the beach, but it is also an adventure to go INTO the mountains like we did. It was a nice change to be able to escape in the peaceful mountains and get away from the crazy busy tourist attractions we had been visiting near the ocean.There are a lot of very scenic drives that you can take. We also noticed a lot of walking trails through the mountains if you're into hiking. There were also a lot of mountain bikers and motorcycle riders on the roads in the mountains.I highly recommend taking a scenic drive in a convertible like we did! The Pacific Coast Highway will lead you beside the ocean & mountains and then you can make a turn to drive up into the mountains. We took Mulholland Highway (NOTE: Mulholland Highway, not Mulholland Drive) and it was one of the highlights of my trip! A narrow, winding, curvy road with lots of hills and blind curves. It was filled with sports cars racing through the mountains. It looked like something straight out of a movie!And best of all? It's FREE!If you do take a scenic drive on Mulholland Highway....just be careful that you don't drive too fast because there are some tricky curves and we noticed several places with loose gravel in the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
50,Peaceful park with great views,"A truly beautiful and historic place. The wealth of good hikes in Southern California is under-appreciated, and those in the LA area get especially short shrift. The SMMs offer some of the most iconically Californian views available to casual hikers, and if you're overwhelmed by the congestion and sprawl for which LA is always derided, this is a nice reprieve.Many trails are easily accessed from the freeway and reasonably well-maintained roads in the mountains. Charmlee Wilderness Park is a good bet if you're less experienced or short on time - very beautiful trails with great views of the ocean and surrounding hills, on-shore whale-watching opportunities at the right time of year (we saw Grays in late December), and only 15 minutes from the 101. My pictures are from this area.This website is helpful for LA and beyond:http://www.modernhiker.com/area-maps/santa-monica-mountains/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SFBA-MNP
50,Miles and miles of trails and scenic drives,"I've noted previously here on TripAdvisor that my family pioneered Santa Monica in 1875 and that we've lived here along the bay since. In addition to the endless joys of Santa Monica beach life, is the amazing availability of recreational opportunities in the surrounding Santa Monica Mountains. There are dozens of great trails from easy to high-moderate whose trailheads begin at nearby Will Rogers State Park and go north and westward to Sycamore Canyon off the Pacific Coast Highway and beyond. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy oversees this huge swath of parkland and uses LAMountains.com for info - a website with a disappointing chock-a-block array of links that are anything but intuitive or simple to use, but that aside, if you poke around you'll find a variety of trails that lead to awesome views of the bay. From Santa Monica, I recommend the following trailheads: Will Rogers (easy), Bienvenida (easy),Westridge (easy) and for variety of efforts and views (and a waterfall), the Santa Ynez Canyon Trail. But for the more ambitious bring your mountain bike or consider the Mishe Mokwa trail which takes you to the peak of the highest mountain (3114') in the range where you can sign the book at the very top. I will always return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhC7522QH

Nice ocean views along the trail. No admission fee to this recreation area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
50,Great cycling venue,"The Santa Monicas are great for road and mtb cyling. As a part of California's transverse ranges, they are unusually steep with many canyons carving through the range.The range starts east of Hollywood and traverses some 40 miles until they are unmercifully chopped off by the Pacific Ocean. This sudden end of the range results in locations with incredible ocean views, and canyon roads with thrilling descents down to Pacific Coast Highway.The best cycling is west of the I-405, where Mulholland Highway (as oppose to Mulholland Drive) traverses across the range, ending up at Pacific Coast Highway.In either type of cycling, you will see many other cyclists taking advantage of the area. Motorists in the area are used to cyclists on the road, which is good for safety.To find good routes in the Santa Monicas, post a query in the Southern California section of BikeFourms.com",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lzzzz
50,Rise above the urban sprawl...,"Most travelers who visit the Los Angeles area see the Santa Monica Mountains as the backdrop to Hollywood and the beach. But if you're a relatively fit person who enjoys serenity and you seek a fresh perspective of Southern California from downtown to Catalina, ditch the throngs of tourists on Venice Beach. Escape the carnival atmosphere and conspicuous consumption of Hollywood and Sunset. If you're a roadie or a mountain biker, rent a quality bike from Helen's Cycles in Santa Monica, Google the best road or mountain bike rides in the Santa Monica Mountains, pick the distance and difficulty that appeals to you and head for the hills. If you're a hiker or trail runner, get some water, Google Las Liones Trail and head up, up, up... to Temescal Overlook. Once there, you'll enjoy an expansive view of Los Angeles from downtown to Orange County, from the Palos Verdes Peninsula to Malibu. If it's a relatively clear day, you'll see Catalina and, likely, even little San Miguel Island a bit north. What you won't see or hear are crowds of people. If you're more adventurous or want to venture a bit further out, Google the Backbone Trail, which runs the length of the Santa Monica Mountains, and hike, run or bike one or more of it's many sections that can be accessed from various canyon roads. Will Rogers State Park contains the closest and easiest portion to access, but every section is unique and beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/597MichelleW

50,Hike with Best Views: Los Liones Trailhead Behind Getty Villa,"You can hike in the Santa Monica mountains from this easy to access trailhead at the end of Los Liones road in Pacific Palisades and see the entire Los Angeles basin.Los Liones drive is off of Sunset Blvd. about a half mile east of Pacific Coast Highway. There are 3 parking lots along Los Liones plus lots of free street parking. There are bathrooms.The trailhead itself is at the very end of the road and is marked by a stone archway.It is a 1.5 mile hike to the top where there is a 360 degree panoramic vista; you can see the entire Los Angeles basin from the Wilshire Corridor to the Santa Monica Bay. On a clear day you will see the Palos Verdes Peninsula.The total trip takes about 1.5 hours - 30 minutes each way plus time to relax at the top. I would consider this trail of moderate difficulty. It is a steady uphill climb. There are some shady places right off the trail where you can rest on a big boulder, if needed.There is a bench at the top and lots of flat area if one wanted to take a picnic (although no shade). The trail is easy to navigate - saw one woman in flip flops. This trail works for runners as well as hikers.This trail is popular on the weekends so you won't be alone.Take water, sunscreen, hat, camera.This trail offers one of the best views of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pricklypoppy
50,Mountain Scenery Next to a Major City,"Santa Monica Mountains are located just west of Santa Monica, very close to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The mountain range is right next to the Pacific and offers great views of the ocean and surrounding areas.I drove through the Santa Monica Mountains over a weekend in Los Angeles and I enjoyed every moment of my trip. I like visiting at least one place of natural scenery wherever I go and the Santa Monica Mountains seemed like a good choice. Living in a completely flat area like I do, it’s hard to imagine that such majestic mountains are right there, next to a major metropolitan area, but they are and they beckoned me to visit. The convenience to L.A. makes these mountains an easy place to get to and drive through so I gassed up the rental car and went on my way.Within the Santa Monica Mountains are a few state parks, a National Recreation area, hiking trails, and a few small villages. A hike affords the best views of the areas, but even the views from the car windows are nice. I drove from the north to the south and I loved the views of the mountains, trees, and countryside. I also liked the moment I reached the Pacific Ocean- it literally burst upon me as I circled a curve and came to the traffic light right there at the Pacific Coast highway.Mountain scenery is great and it’s especially memorable when you spend your days and nights living in a place that is completely flat. The Santa Monica Mountains provided me a nice nature fix and I plan to return on my next visit to the Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Great_Beer_Now

40,Great Mountains,"I was born in Santa Monica and used to drive through these mountains all the time. Before the freeway was built, there was just Sepulveda Blvd that went through to the San Fernando Valley, and it was a lovely drive. One place you don't want to miss when in the Santa Monica area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonGrammy
50,Great hiking!,"If your'e in town and wanting a lively hike to burn off all the delicious meals you are eating while in town, then the Santa Monica Mountains is the place for you! There are gentle hikes and challenging hikes and the views are unparalleled. I would say go with friends, in the unlikely case that you get lost on a trail, but there are usually hikers around that can help you find your way back. The ocean breeze is the big attraction, you don't get that at Runyan Canyon LOL! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryDavid1
50,Stunning Views,"A great place for a short or long hike. Easily accessible from the city. And you are in another world walking amongst the hills. Great views over the ocean, downtown and suburbs. Highly recommended to get away from it all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieH15

50,Good trail around Will Rogers Park,"We accessed the trails via Will Rogers Park, and walked up to Inspiration Point, where we had a fabulous, 360-degree view of Santa Monica, West Los Angeles, Century City, Santa Monica Mountains, and, of course, the Pacific Ocean. Considering how beautiful the scenery is and how many people live in Los Angeles, I was shocked that we only ran into a few other day hikers. The trail we were on hooked up with the Topanga Canyon trail, and it looked like you could go just about anywhere through the Santa Monica Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94meganm
50,In the mountains!,"Really fun.... technical drive up in the mountains, but wow the view is spectacular. We even saw a storm roll into the mountains, the clouds poured right on top of us while we were hiking the Topanga trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerekR
50,EXCELLENT VIEWS from up top!,"For Los Liones Canyon Trail ---Parker Mesa CanyonI drove up north on Paseo Miramar until I hit the dead end. Once at the dead end, turn left and you'll the entrance to the trail. I thought I was getting lost coming here for the first time. I'm sure there's another entrance but this is where my GPS lead me when adding yelp's listed address.What a great workout! I would rate this trail at a Medium difficulty level. It's a paved, dirt road and it's fairly easy but you'll definitely work a sweat going up and down the trail. Definitely a good 5 mile roundtrip workout for anyone.I went on a nice, breezy day with almost no sun so had no difficult going up the trail. If it's blazing hot, would highly recommend you come prepared with sunscreen and water.Loved that this trail wasn't crowded and there was plenty of parking on the street up the hill. There's a beautiful view of Santa Monica, Downtown, and the ocean the minute you get on that trail. In fact, I saw several groups of people there solely to take pictures 0.2 miles into the trail.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoseC253
40,Splendid View and not all level trails,"Actually this is a very big mountain includes a lot of trails. So it's a little hard to come up with a general review on the whole site. You could try HikeSpeak to get detail about each trail. Just the pics won't be so updated like TripAdvisor. We took Los Leones Canyon trail in a little cloudy day which I believe is right weather for hiking since I don't enjoy the sunshine too much. The trail is 2 miles long one-way and not too hard or steep, but a little dirty and slippery, so remember to get some good hiking shoes. And when you reach the Parker Mesa Overlook, there's a bench which you could get the whole Santa Monica Bay in your sight. Good spot to relax. Higher is a little steeper but could manage. Nice little trail for neighborhood and family too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562yingl

50,Nature Overlooking LA,"The Santa Monica Mountains is a large, mostly natural area exhibiting a rare Mediterranean environment which offers a multitude of recreational activates from hiking, camping, motoring, horseback riding and much more just northwest of LA. Composed of many public lands and some private lands encompassing well know and lesser know parks, valleys and roads, many used for filming familiar movies and shows, and reaches down to the ocean where there are many famous beaches. Highlights include Paramount Ranch (Dr. Quinn and many films), Malibu State Park (M*A*S*H, Planet of the Apes), King Gillette Ranch (The Biggest Loser), the famous Mulholland Drive and the Hollywood Sign, the Mulholland Highway (which we preferred), Topanga State Park, Runyon Canyon Park and Will Rogers State Park. There is much more and if one is spending any time in LA, one should spend at least a day exploring and enjoying the area and visiting one of the famous beaches at the base of the mountains. We would recommend stopping by the Interagency Visitor Center next to King Gillette Ranch to see the exhibits, introductory movie and help with planning your visit including current programs and events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve5863
50,My backyard is very entertaining,"We are so fortunate to have the lovely Santa Monica Mountains to play in. Do a Google search to see all the fantastic hiking trails. I enjoy hiking from January to June because I favor wildflowers, butterflies, and other nature (not into the ""long view"" so hoofing to the top of a mountain is not entertaining to me). There are some great wildflower hikes throughout.Take the trailhead from Pacific Coast Highway so you can enjoy views of the Pacific along your hikes.Some trails take you through filming locations; the most famous is Malibu Creek, where MASH used to be filmed.If you visit LA to do more than looking for celebrities or theme parks, please do a search to find your bliss in the Santa Monica Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plumeriad2017
50,Beautiful ... and peaceful,"I go hiking in different areas of the Santa Monica mountains on a regular basis, each weekend almost. Malibu or Topanga Canyon are the most popular access points for me since I live here. There's plenty of peaceful hiking trails for outings, with excellent viewpoints, depending on how high you'd like to go up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skinmeister
50,Beautiful - but plan in advance,"My wife & I wanted to get out of the city for a bit and see the amazing views of the Santa Monica mountains, so off we went, drove for an hour and a half and parked up at the parking area just after Circle X Ranch, armed with a pre-planned 7 mile route from a hiking website that was to take us across three different peaks. And walk it we did - but during a heatwave, with no hats, and nowhere near enough water. By the end it was getting a little hairy and we were just glad to be safe and back in civilisation.If you're spending some time in LA then do yourself a favour and get into these mountains - the views are incredible. Just research a good route in advance, make sure you're comfortable with the distances and the heights involved, and if you think you have enough water, double it and maybe add a little more. This is not a place you want to get stranded!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scruff_UK

It's pretty hard to get lost. There's an updated map posted at the entrances and a few trail markers along the way. Restrooms near the parking area.There are also longer trails good for hiking and or trail-running. A long approx 14 mile loop can start or end from Temescal or Will Rogers (via the Backbone Trail).Gorgeous vistas over the ocean.

50,Beautiful Santa Monica Mountains,"Santa Monica Mountains are a great hiking destination in the urban sprawl. I have hiked several trails in these mountains at least once a month. You can mountain bike, hike, picnic (in some locations), barbeque (in some locations), see incredible views of the ocean from the ridge near the ocean. It is amazing. The beauty surrounds you. There are trail areas with creeks and waterfalls on some of the hikes with lots of shade but these areas are specific to certain trails. There are trees too, but it depends on the hike. There are lots of fire roads for easy hiking. The landscape is mostly desert like with tons of bushes, dry grass, and cactus, but you do see some amazing rock formations. A few of the trails allow you to take dogs, in fact the Mandeville Canyon hike lets you take the dogs off leash. Hikes ranges from easy to steep. You can see wildlife including deer, coyote and yes, snakes. I would recommend taking a snack bite kit for emergencies. The best time of year for me to enjoy the Santa Monica mountains is fall, winter, and spring. It can get really hot in the summer. I suggest hiking early in the morning in the summer and towards dusk in the summer. If you are in LA check out the nature side of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/651CathyA

The drive through the area is a wonderful trip and there are many scenic vistas and areas to go into the mountains on marked hiking trails. Some of the trails are a little rocky but certainly not an issue for the adventurous. If you are visiting the Los Angeles area like I was I would highly recommend going a little out of the way to enjoy these mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtomicReviewer
40,Mishe Mokwa Trail,"Mishe Mokwa is definitely a strenuous hike made even more difficult by the rocky path coming down from Sandstone Peak. The backend of the trail (Backbone Trail) is full of loose baseball-sized rocks, and we had to carefully pick our way over the trail so that we wouldn't slip going downhill. That said, the views from Mishe Mokwa are incredible! Very scenic trail. Magical views when you reach the top. I would just recommend avoiding the backend of the trail and maybe looping back over Mishe Mokwa instead of taking Backbone back. Makes for a longer hike, but you might save your ankles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RMLosAngeles

They contain some real neat stuff, like Will Rogers State Park, The Hollywood Bowl, Forest Lawn, the Hollywood Sign and the Griffith Park Observatory, oh yea Griffith Park as well.

Some rivers, streams, some waterfalls, some wildlife, lots of sunshine or trails through wild woods. Some remains of forest fires, but the regrowth is green and thrusting.

Within 20 minutes from Santa Monica, one can be hiking mountain trails in the company of deer, rabbits, snakes, birds, and the occasional mountain lion (although I have never seen one). I usually hike in Topanga State Park, (which is a short drive north on Hwy 1 and up Topanga Canyon), where I hike on a series of fire roads and hiking trails. The array of options allow a hiker to find dramatic views of the Pacific Ocean and the metropolis of Los Angeles, as well as shady paths crossing trickling streams. In the winter the grasses are green, changing to lovely wild flowers in the spring and golden slopes in the summer.

50,Hike!,Best hikes - Los Liones is my fave. All of them are gorgeous. You can't go wrong.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9276GBandreas
50,Great Place to Get Away,There are so many amazing trails and places to see. You really feel like you're away from the city even though you can be right in the middle of it. Most of the trails are dog friendly as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Max0325
50,A good way to spend a few days with beautiful vistas and interesting natural surroundings.,"You can hike here in nearly pristine mountain surroundings, on good trails with views to distant horizons, surrounded by sights of local flora and fauna. You have to go there and be there to really appreciated how breathtaking it can be!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
50,close in hikes,"Lots of different hikes close in to the West side and accessible enough to the rest of LA and SF Valley residents. View them as stretching from Ventura County Line to Brentwood. Take the backbone trail from Will Rogers or reach it from Temescal Canyon or lower Palisades Drive and go up to Topanga State Park. Do the 6.5 mile loop at Sandstone Peak. Hike up to the Nike missile site from Brentwood. Not all as rugged or wooded as the San Gabriels, but a world away from LA, with views of civilization.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toughnouggies
30,Okay if you like costal sage scrub and dry hills,"I have lived in Los Angeles all my life and have always wondered why so many people are amazed by the Santa Mountains. Sure you can hike and bike and picknic there only 10-30 minutes from most parts of the greater city of Los Angeles but compared to the nearby mountains in the urban areas of San Francisco, Portland, Salt Lake, or Denver, just to name a few, these mountains hold no allure other than the fact that they are about the only natural environment left in Los Angeles. If you are traveling here just to experience the Santa Monica mountains and are expecting something wounderful and unique don't waste the time or money. The true hidden gem in the greater Los Angeles area is the urban forest and hiking trails that can be found in the Palos Verdes area 30 miles to the south along the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVGreg
50,Wonderful 360 degree views,"We'd a couple of hikes into the mountains, including Will Rogers State Historic Park. Lovely scenery - and amazing view of LA and the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinhenshaw

50,Beautiful,"Whether you are viewing them from a distance from Santa Monica to tromping through Will Rogers Park, the Santa Monica mountains offer so much to the quality of life experience in the coastal LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrblurge
50,great hiking,"great hiking with ocean views in the park. you can enter off of PCH or through Will Rodgers park. I like the backbone trail but the park website has many options. You need good shoes, it is hilly and take water with you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vgreene
50,WOW! Worth the drive in..,I was coming uo from Downtown Santa Monica to Calabasas and decided to take Malibu Canyon RD up from the PCH instead of the freeway. I'm glad I did! Just the incredibly beautiful drive of the canyons on my way up was amazing. Once I got to my destination I just drove through mts and saw some the most spectacular scenery I've ever seen. Go to Malibu Creek State park and just drive the mountains. There's hiking trails all over the place you don't have to pay admission for. I took a turn on Mullholland Hwy. Nice! Also for amazing views take Piuma Rd up into the mts too. Excellent. These are the best views of the valley below and there's a bunch of turnouts to stop at. I can't say enough about this area. You feel so removed from everything but you are literally 30 minutes from the Ocean and downtown. California is the best state for natural scenery in my opinion. I love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mscud1
