50,Mini-Golf needs a face lift!,"For the price being charged, the owner/managment needs to invest a little money into the 9 hole mini-golf course. I used to love this place as a young kid/teen so I brought my own kids here this time. I love to patron the local businesses of my youth. BUT, when it comes to this mini-golf, the wear n' tear messes with the fun. I'd rather spend my $6 ($3 for early birds) for a better 18 hole maintained course at the Sheman Oaks Castle. Sorry, Arroyo Seco, but lower the price oo upgrade the course!",Raq S

40,Casual fun,Nothing fancy here- just simple casual fun to be had.Nothing too long or crazy hard. Great place to learn and play without pressure.Inexpensive and the facility shows- don’t arrive thinking swanky and perfectly manicured but it’s absolutely playable and fun.,Drew
