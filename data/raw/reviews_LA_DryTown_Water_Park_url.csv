30,It was ok,Dry town is a decent place. But on certain days very long lines and you cannot bring outside food or drinks for the kids,eddiecatalan
20,Not well kept,"Its run by a bunch of teens who are on a power trip, lack customer service skills and are too lazy to walk around cleaning up. That has potential to be a great AV spot but the lack of management there makes it a nightmare to go and deal with the clueless staff. I rather drive to raging waters then drive 5 min and go to dry town.",Deepsteve1
40,Clean and accessible,"Safe for kids and families, but it gets crowded sometimes. The raging river is the main attraction for most people, but water slides are available too.",Tipmore
50,Fun way to spend a day!,"We visited here to spend time with extended family. We arrived around noon and stayed until closing at 6. We rented a cabana for a half day to allow us all to hang out together. Surprisingly, this is a city park. It is very well managed and the lifeguard staff is always on alert. My youngest (4 years old) loved, no .... got obsessed with, the lazy river. They have the occasional tube to hop in, but most folks just walk or float the river. The water slides are great... kids between 42-48 inches can ride two of the four larger ones. The other two are for those 48"" and over. There is also a good sized ""Little Miners"" area for the small ones with a play structure inside a huge splash pad. Lockers are available to rent for $5/day, although you get $1 back when you turn the key back in, you aren't allowed to bring your own food in, but the concession stand is moderately priced about $7-9 for burgers or a basket of chicken or fish strips with fries.",WestCoastRestless
50,Fun,"It was so fun at this waterpark. We had a wonderful time. Not crowded and had things for all ages. Everything was clean. Oh, and the restaurant in the park was amazing!",Dee Johnson
50,Took my son and met with family.,Loved how the park was nicely cleaned and maintained well. My son loved his trip just hard to buy cheaper tickets only certain dates. Would be nice to have like deal dates during the summer and packages for large groups so it's not killing the wallet. But we love how the park is and will be back once it opens again.,rruelas8806
40,Lazy river in the afternoon,"The park is fairly small, but there are still a variety of attractions to appeal to many tastes. The lazy river is very relaxing, as long as you look out for the occasional group of teens horsing around. Staff is pretty quick to correct bad behavior, so it isn't too bad. Most of the slides are partially covered (tubes), so plan accordingly depending on whether that bothers you. There is a large pool adjacent to the park that is not included in the park, but should be when it isn't being used for other activities. They have a snack bar at reasonable prices, and a smaller kid splash / play area for getting soaked on a hot summer day.",travelguy537
40,We love the lazy river!!!,"Small water park, but nice enough to enjoy with my 6 year old grandkid. The day we chose, was a bit busier because there were buses with summer camp kids, but we still had a good time. I am not sure if older kids will enjoy, although they have a couple of big slides.",317sbuck
40,Dry Town Fun,"Small water park, but packed with fun. Had a great time with my small kids 5-7 years old. staff was friendly. prices reasonable. lines for rides moved along quickly.",Kasinda
20,Unfair policy,"As a grandmother dealing with surgery recovery I cannot get in the water. I purchased a ticket for my grandson who is 10 and cannot enter without an adult.But, they would not let me enter without paying for a full price ticket.Fortunately a friend going in took my grandson under her wing...thank you Kathy.I would suggest a minimal fee for folks that cannot go in the water but are needed for younger children to enter. To pay a full price to be eyes for supervision is unfair.",Karen M
50,Great place to cool off,"We live coming to this little water park! They have a lazy river, kids area for the little ones, and several slides.",Elle26
50,Fun local place on a hot day,"The price was $25.00 per person 48"" and up. Free parking. Not huge but big enough to spend 7 hours and have a fun time. Especially on a hot day! I thought the price was OK. You can rent cabanas but there's plenty of chairs around the park with shade so umbrellas weren't needed. You can only take 1 bottle of water in per person so need to buy drinks and food there. It was kind of expensive but the burger and burrito was actually pretty dang good. Buy a big cup for a drink and get free refills on water and soda refills are $1.50. Good chocolate chip cookies for $2.25. There are tons of lifegaurds and employees keeping a very good eye out on everyone. The place is nice and clean. I recommend for all ages.",RLHINCA
50,Close and fun!,Always love going to this water apart it's local and affordable and you can always come home for lunch or bring your own lunch to picnic on the grassy areas around the wayerpark. Just enough thinhs to do so the kids have a good time and you don't have to drive an hour to Magic Mountain.,Sharonda H
50,Great escape from the Heat.,"We love this place, always clean and lots of lifeguards and supervision. The water slides and lazy river are lots of fun.Looking forward to goinf back.",ninot203
40,Inexpensive way to relax and have fun.,"Features a lazy river, two towers with differing rides, a great kids wet play area, lots of recliner pool chairs and available cabanas. Soak up some Antelope Valley sun, float down the lazy river, slide to your hearts content. Lockers are available and decent food.",Mclellan J
50,Lazy River is Relaxing!,Fun times for all here! I enjoy the lazy river while the kids can get on the water slides! Perfect attraction to keep cool in the AV's summer months,Gerice D
40,Good family experience for the cost,"This was our second trip to dry town (2 adults and 4 children ages 10, 8, 5, and 5). Both experiences were the same (previous trip was July 2017). Overall, our family had a great time on both trips. Good experience for the cost (using military discount rates). I recommend you arrive early to find shaded seating and/or look at renting a cabana. The lines for some of the slides didn’t detract from the trip or value overall and the crowds weren’t overbearing (even on 4th of July). The only negative or drawback we experienced was with the food options which overall are not good. This place would be way better with some improved food options.",Jason S
50,around town,exciting things to do for the whole family. Take the kids and enjoy your day as there is something for the whole family to enjoy. Try it you'll like it,williamnS7303DK
50,Good local spot,Fairly new so it's clean. Very well maintained. Not so big that you would lose the kids but enough attractions to keep them entertained for a few hours.I wish that they would consider keeping the park opened until late because the Antelope Valley sun is just too intense.More food choices would also be nice.,Mystique
40,DryTown with friends and grandkids,"This is the place to be on a hot desert day. The 1st thing we do is rent a ""Cabana"". $45 for 1/2 day, $80 for all day. There is other shady options. There's a variety of water slides there (with height requirements). One has a choice of 3 different levels of slides. Another has 4 tubes (enclosed) going down so you can 'race'. There's a toddler area, less than 1 foot deep or so, which also has a MINI water slide. In that area is a big bucket that fills up with water, then dumps, so you can stand under to get soaked. My favorite is the Lazy River. You can grab a tube if available and float along, or just cool off by walking or swimming it. There's also a 'lap' pool. Don't know anything about that one. There's a Subway in the park. No outside food is allowed, outside drinks are allowed. It opens at 11:00am, closes at various times it looks like. Nice cool place to go in the high desert.",Hoolegan
50,Nice for the kids,"I came here after looking for a public pool of some kind. I was pleasantly surprised at this location. I had my nephew 8 and my niece 7 , who had a blast on the water slides etc. The park was not busy and it made for a relaxing afternoon. They were able to ride each attraction multiple times without having to wait. Luckily, it was the last week of school for the local kids. Employees were everywhere ensuring the safety of each child and that was a plus. They didn't seem distracted at all . If I'm ever in the area again with small children I would definitely stop by.",Katrina M
50,fun and sun,me and husband had a blast there very clean very nice people love the rides and the service was awesome,Cathy T
30,Palmdale School District Event,Good place for small children. A lot of supervision during busses Hours. The downside is that they don't allow us to take any kind of food in and there food is pretty expensive.,NancyLuis
40,Cool waters for hot days,We've been annual ticket holders for several years. We especially like the park for the young child's area and the lazy river. We've also hosted a birthday party there which was fun.,438karif
40,Fun place to beat the heat,"Definitely a good value of you pay attention for discounts. My kids enjoyed visiting this summer. There are two sets of water slides, a playground area, and a lazy river. They have free tubes in the lazy river and free life vests that you can utilize. I would personally plan to not eat at the park as the options are very limited. They have some junk food type snacks and prepackaged subway sandwiches. One big negative for me is that they are very strict on what you can bring in. You can bring in a full dinner to Disneyland but they limit what you can bring in to one small snack for children and one water bottle per person.",Lindsey H
50,Best way to beat the heat,The best way to beat the hot summer heat . Something for every age here . Clean and well supervised . Season pass is the best deal going .,Adriene P
50,Fun fun fun,"Took the kids at 1pm until 5pm, the kids enjoyed the kids area which had 3-4 lifeguards. We used their life vests/flotation which come in x small, small, medium and large. All the facilities are clean including the bathrooms.We all enjoyed Subway sandwiches and drinks which cost about 1-2 dollars more per person than a regular subway.A great fun experience and especially on these hot days.",videorudy
40,Summer fun,"Fun place to take the kids. Water-slides, Lazy river & area for young children too. Great place to cool off in the Antelope Valley.",Louise K
50,our favorite place to go!,we like to get the season pass and go here any time during the Summer! it's a great place to hangout and stay cool on those hot days! we love floating around the lazy river. it's great they have a separate area for the young/toddler kids to play. the rides are fun! and it's also fun to go during their Friday night sessions!,mziel16
40,Alternate physical therapy,Great location to take the kids during the hot summer weather. Lots of water to cool their jets while they get worn out from all the exercise they get. I took an adult exercise class that met two nights a week in the river to walk against the current and exercise in the water. The water provides resistance to your body as you move against the current. Great exercise during the cooler evening temperatures.,Steve B
30,OK for families,"Nice way to cool off but needs better maintenance and more understanding staff. You have to fight with others for the floating devices to use on the slides and in the lazy river. On a crowded day you may not get one. When landing in the pool after a big slide i was underwater and momentarily stunned but staff yelled at me to get out fast to make room for more people to slide down. One time I was relaxing on an tube and floating down the lazy river when suddenly, for some reason, the staff said they had to take all the floating devices away. I am sure they had a good reason but it ruined the experience for me.",Lauralyn K
50,Family Fun!!,"We love spending the day at Drytown. Lazy River, Slides, Kids Area...something for everyone. The Friday Night activities are fun too. Season Ticket holders every year",LydiaMichaelMaine
20,family fun???,"I went to dry town water park with my 3 children ages 12,10, and 7. They had fun but they became bored quickly. The lines are long and not to much to do. They are also over priced but well work if you wound like to just have a day out.",joker198618
20,It was okay,"This place is small, and it is not like Six Flag's hurricane Harbor. There are not that many rides. There are lifeguards everywhere but they are very strict. My 6 year old son has to put up a thumbs up sign overtime he goes underwater. For the price they are charging, it is not worth it and definitely will not do it again.",Ting Y
40,Water park with the minis,"Nice size waterpark for the location, it's kinda out far on the east side. Park is clean and well kept. There were lifeguards everywhere and things were run very well. The bathrooms were ok, could be a little cleaner but all in all decent. The only complaint is that the prices are really too high! The food and the price for park entry is ridiculous for the amount of things offered to do. There is free covered parking which is nice. Also the extra charge for the cabanas are pricey, the city is clearly taking advantage of the public. Overall a nice day out for the family as it is for little toddlers and teens.",Mauigirl_001
40,Nice local Waterpark,"Drytown Waterpark is a nice place to go for a family outing during the day. The slides and lazy river are fun. The kids area is pretty nice too. Definitely better to take a cooler with lunch in it to go outside the park and have a picnic in the shade because the Subway is more expensive than the typical Subway and the options are limited. The earlier you arrive the better availability of seats for you to place your belongings at. They do have lockers, but for a cost, of course. The special night openings are pretty cool, so check for those dates each year.",Alexis G
50,Whooooo!,"We live down the street. Walking distance, good price, great atmosphere. Lines are worth it too! My favorite part is the lazy river! Customer service was pretty good but attendants could be more attentive to adults as well as kids too.",travelkatt23
40,Half a day outing for the younger kids,This place is cool is you live out here. Close by and free parking. The place is small so it's easy to get around and there's always enough seating for everyone. The prices are inexpensive considering what other parks charge. They have an area for the smaller kids with lots of small slides and hoses and in about 1ft deep of water. They also have a lazy river and some slides for the older kids. There is usually a line but not as bad as the other parks. They don't let you bring outside food in. But you can leave and come back if you don't want to pay for over priced food. Try not to go on a windy day... Which happens often out here. I wouldn't get the season pass. My kids are over going to thy place more than 1 or 2 times a season.,love2travel513
40,Nice place for a relaxing day with the kids,Spent the day here with the kids. Not a big fancy waterpark with top notch rides. It has a lazy river and a few water slides and a child play area. Older teenagers may get bored quick here but the younger kids will have a great time. Adults love the lazy river.,LA_Deputy
40,Nice Outdoor Fun For THE kiddos,"I took my nieces here and I thought it would be crowded with no where to sit but when you get inside dry town has chairs around the whole place which make things a lot easier. My nieces enjoyed splashing and going down the slides. The the price is very inexpensive, the water is warm and clean.",shortcake28
40,Loved the Lazy River,Lots of cool water for those hot days in the Antelope Valley.Great for families or couples. The Lazy river is fun to just cruze along in a innertube. Lots of fun for the children too,Lisa S
40,Youth Group Fun,"We took our junior high youth group here one Sunday evening. The kids had a blast. In addition to a handful of big slides, there is also a lazy river that you can just float around in to your heart's content.I wish they were more strict about their swimming attire policy. It is a water park, you should be wearing a bathing suit. On more than one occasion I've seen people in pants, jeans, and all sorts of other clothes that shouldn't be allowed.Other than that main complaint, we've always had a good time.",hek1122
30,Fun but not that safe.,i have been going to dry town since it opened and even got a season pass two different years. i was very satisfied my first visit but as i went more often it got boring and i kept getting stuck on the yellow slide.(i am a skinny person) they later had to shut down dry town to fix those first three slides because too many people were getting hurt. once that was fixed they then decided to create three more slides that were even more dangerous. i have gone on them four times and have gotten hurt three out of four times once even after they shut down dry town again to fix them. i love being able to go someplace fun every summer but do not like getting hurt everytime i go.,Timmyturner14
40,A LOT OF FUN,"for a small venue, it is well maintained and enjoyable, we had a blast and it is good for all ages, not badly priced either!",Annette H
40,Great Neighborhood Attraction,"DryTown is a great place to spend time with the kids. Our granddaughter who is eight does it all, from slides to the Lazy River. When she was a bit younger she had a great time in the children’s area.Regarding lunch, you can purchase food on-site, but we normally pack a lunch. We just exit the park and there is some grass areas near the parking lot where we have a small picnic. The parking lot isn’t that far so it is very convenient.Overall I am very pleased with the park and will continue to visit every summer.",Charles B
30,A few good hours of fun if you happen ti be in the area,It is a pretty nice water park. In summer days is packed with people and this is the only negative aspect of the water park. I also wish they would have extended hours so during the week we could enjoy our annual passes.,gcarrasco
40,Pleasant Day,I was a little apprehensive to take the kids to Drytown. I had children ranging from 2 through seventeen. We had a great day. There was enough options to keep everyone happy and entertained. The kiddie pool was nice. We all enjoyed the lazy river and the slides were fast and scary enough to satisfy the teens.On the down side if you spend the day there you will want to eat. You cannot bring in your own food and their offering is a snack bar with mediocre food.Overall though we had a great day.,Jim B
40,Dry Town Water Park,Great place to go to relax and soak up the sun. Kids will really enjoy themselves too on the water playground and the water slides. Good family fun.,ccswimz
40,Drytown,Pretty good especially when they have the Drytown after dark going on... At nighttime it's a whole different experience..,Luis A
40,nice to visit if in the area,"This is a desert. Any water attraction is more than welcome in 100' heat! That being said,this park has something for all ages. One structure has 3 slides to choose from, one of them being the toilet bowl and the others are meandering slides. The toilet bowl is good enough to scare anyone. The heavier the load the faster the swish. The meandering are just plain fun. The second structure has the racers. Lazy river is always wonderful and there is a children's play area with all the squirting. A locker is recommended if you don't want anything to ""disappear"". This is a higher altitude, so you NEED sunblock. We take our meals and eat by the car, but the snack bar is doable. The food line gets pretty long during crowded times. There are outside showers to rinse off, but no changing facility. I wouldn't go out of my way to get to this water park, but if you're within an hour's drive, it's worth it.",7seekers
40,"Good, Simple, Family Fun",A simple family-friendly waterpark. Kids loved playing and food prices were inexpensive. Down the street from Walmart and Target and Grocery stores. Pick up what we needed and headed over for a day of fun inthe sun. Parking was easy and free. Would go back again if I was in the area.,Winter P
