50,Still the Best!,"Having previously visited and reviewed Paramount Iceland, I can verify that it had been the best ice in the Los Angeles area and the business did take suggestions to refurbish restrooms to heart. They're not completely modernized, but the stalls have been updated. The snack bar has been closed down doe years, replaced by vending, but ice rinks are meant for skating. The coaching staff continues to be top-flight, and many well decorated athelets train and succeed thanks to this rink. I believe it will continue to thrive.",Dunebuggy4
40,Ice Skating fun,"Paramount Iceland is a fun place to go, especially on a date. They have skate rentals, a small snack bar, and bleachers in case you start to get tired. A fun place that is fairly inexpensive.",Dereck C
30,Ice skating in socal,"I have to say that I wasn't impressed. Their rental skates looked as if they had survived WWI, their concession stand had the feel of a little league baseball game, and the ice had quite a few divets. Daughter had fun, but nothing great. Average 3 stars.",Dereck S
50,"Fantastic Ice, Top Notch Staff!","This Ice rink is considered to be among the very best in the world. It is also a historical landmark, the location at which the first Zamboni was invented. The Zamboni company still furnishes ice resurfacing machines to this rink, and the very first Zamboni is proudly on display in the northwest corner of the rink.World-class coaches instruct in this rink, though their numbers seem to have dwindled over the last year. The snack bar has been closed for years, replaced by vending machines in the 'warm-room' and the bathrooms have seen better days but the free on-property parking is well maintained and rest of the facility is quite nice. The skate shop has very good equipment and an excellent, knowledgeable staff. The most important thing about any ice rink, however, is the actual ice. Paramount Iceland's over-sized Olympic ice sheet is absolutely fantastic!!! It is well groomed with few ruts and only a slight uphill slant from one end to the other, exceptionally smooth and springy.Adult skaters do well with Tuesday evening Wurlitzer night or the one remaining morning public session on Wednesday mornings. Learn-to-Skate group lessons are reasonably priced and feature expert coaching from resident staff including junior coaches who currently compete, all of whom are very patient and thorough.First-time skaters are well advised to visit on weekend evenings or during Wurlitzer nights, when the pro's are scarce.",Dunebuggy4
