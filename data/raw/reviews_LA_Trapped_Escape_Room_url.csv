50,"Awesome Escape Rooms, Great Staff","I've done all but one of Trapped's rooms in both Upland and San Dimas, I've loved every one. They go to the next level with the immersion experience with both the staff interaction, and the room decor. Puzzles range from very easy to very challenging, there's something for every skill level. Highly recommended.",ajsmith1623
50,Grandma's Closet,"This outing was family, but we were all adults. It was the first Escape Room for all of us. The staff was very friendly and helpful getting us started. The puzzles were great. We will do another one soon.",bjkoi
50,Great host!,We had a fantastic time. Grandma’s surprise really did surprise us. We were so glad it was more than we expected! Returning soon.,raympotter
50,Fun evening!,"My friend was in from out of town and I took her to her first escape room here. We really loved it! The staff was friendly, interactive, and made the whole event super fun! I definitely want to go back to try another one of their escape rooms.",NathaenR
50,A fun family day!!!,The staff was great from the start. This trapped location was easy to find and although I needed extra hints the staff was so helpful and still made it challenging and so fun!!! We still talk about it.,my2bees1602
50,X-13,"This was our group's first time at the San Dimas location and our host, Jen, was absolutely fantastic. The room we did was more interactive that ones we have done in the past and she was a blast to engage with as we went through our room and its clues. Highly recommend this location and the room we did (I believe it was called X-13) with the army vests.",langelsown
50,Amazing experience with awesome game masters (Aaron & Michael)!,"Decided to tackle ""Operation X-13"" with a group of 2 (with 15+ escape room experience) on President's Day 2/17/2020. It's a challenging and fun room, with tons of bonus quests to tackle if you complete the main mission with time to spare. The challenges were well thought out and planned and weren't too obvious or linear, which was good. Aaron and Michael were fun game masters and definitely a blast to chat with, and did a great job at immersing themselves into characters for the rooms. Only warning is, I hope you don't have a pacemaker if you're doing this room, because that Lookout can be REAL loud. We loved the room and challenges so much that we signed up for same-day Grandmother's Surprise (discount for same-day bookings!). Another well-crafted room with interesting puzzles that remind me of 60 Out's ""Grandma's Masterplan,"" but with a different / shorter story line. I love the fact that for both rooms, the Game Master will go through the clues with you at the end, which not all locations do. Also love the fact that all the rooms may be linked through the nefarious Cybortek Corporation. It's a testament to the passion that these designers and creators have for their rooms, to throw small easter eggs that link their universe together. Definitely will be going back when ""Pandora's Box"" opens up!",Norris T
50,Michael is the best,Michael was a great GM. Both Grandma’s Surprise and Operation X13 were fun but Michael made Grandma’s extra fun by sending us extra puzzles. I would come back just for his customer service!,foxylf28
50,Escape Room San Dimas,Great overall experience. We had a fun and challenging time solving Operations X-13. Plan to return soon.,my1adonai
50,Very Fun!,Very fun! My husband and I have done a few rooms before. We decided to take my mom. We all had a lot of fun.,misscompton27
50,Delighted by Grandma's Surprise at Trapped! Escape Room,"Our family of 4: parents (57) and kids (20 & 22) had a wonderful adventure, working together to solve the puzzles and mystery of Grandma's Surprise -- and we really were surprised! We plan to visit again and try the other escape room than San Dimas offers (and then maybe the Trapped! rooms in Upland, after that. A great teamwork exercise.",Paulinski211
50,"Very well organized, clean, fun, great concepts and room!","Lobby was extremely clean and had areas for photo taking and lockers for storing your valuables. Escape Room (we only did one room, Grandma's Bday, there were multiple rooms available) was fun, exciting! Great concept! Went with coworkers for team building. WE HAD A LOT OF FUN! Kudos to this outfit! Plus, exceptional customer service. The gals really took great care of us. Thank you!",WorldWideTraveler68
50,Excellent,Staff were helpful and friendly! Our group had the Sector 13 room. The puzzles were very creative and fun to solve. We got out with just 4 seconds to spare!,wuwill3
50,Down The Rabbit Hole Was a blast,My team of 7 people from our office booked down the rabbit hole with Trapped in Upland. They were very professional. It was a great team building experience. We escaped with a few minutes left. Love these guys at trapped. I highly recommend them.,peterwN4059UY
