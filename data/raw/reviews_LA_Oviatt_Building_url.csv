40,A perfect wedding night ~,"We went here for a wedding this past weekend - There is a penthouse at the very top (obviously) that has some amazing features! THey have a restored art deco bedroom suite for guests to checkout just as you come in off of the elevator into the foyer. Walk down a narrow hallway to a bar area which was cute and quaint with what looked like original windows. The bar then leads out onto the rooftop terrace which has beautiful views of the city and surrounding buildings (US Bank, BofA, etc...) Be aware though - for those of you attending a wedding here, the bathroom are quite a trek! The men's is one flight down whereas the women's is 2 flights down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrsbasom
