50,Lovely Historic Building,I was going for a stroll around Downtown and remembered hearing about the Fine Arts Building (built in 1927) online so I figured I would give it a quick look. It is really gorgeous and is covered with beautiful Romanesque sculpture work. If you squint your eyes and don’t look side to side it can feel like you’re in Europe looking at this building!The lobby is also lovely and has a cool fountain in the middle and some art exhibits on both sides of the room (hence the name Fine Arts Building). If you’re in the area it’s definitely worth a look!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
40,Take a few moments to enjoy the facade and then take in the lobby,"It is one of those little gems that you can easily walk by and barely notice, particularly if you always walk on the other side of the street and just look up and down the sidewalk. Built in 1927, it is a 12 story building with an elaborate façade and a gorgeous lobby--in the Romanesque Revival style. Next time you are walking by, allocate 10-15 minutes to enjoy the outside (the two large sculptures were what first caught my attention), and then walk in to be pleasantly surprised by the extend of the intricate details throughout the entire lobby--including the elevators. I hear they display art in the glass cabinets--we must have been between shows. I found out later that it is referenced in the film (500) Days of Summer. I love serendipitously finding these architectural treats.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adalbert3
50,Beautiful building from the mid 1920's......,"Two reclining statues flank the two sides of the façade roughly 30 feet off the ground, basically telling you that this building is rooted in, and has something to do with, the arts, whether Italian or ancient Greek. The façade mimics those of Italian Palaces of Renaissance origin.The lobby is small but very ornate. Two stories high and you feel as if you walked into the nave of a Gothic church. Artist in residence or those that have studios in the building display their work in the 17 showcases of glass and rich dark wood, with works rotating weekly.It’s cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname
