40,Charming Neighborhood,"I was in the area for a garden tour that takes place 1x every two years...which was really wonderful. The starting post for the tour was a community center in Leimert Park Village and then we traveled to homes in the area to see....their gardens. The village center has a few walking blocks, several vacancies, and several eateries and shops, many with African made goods, a nice bookstore, too. It might be fun to check it out again and eat at one of the restaurants there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,A new jewel to many... but home to most that have been in the neighborhood.,"Leimert is, and has always been a well kept, manicured, predominantly African American area. Much to offer and friendly people.We've been here doing this...but gentrification makes it seem like something new.... blah blah blahCome get up to speed and get the truth by seeing the reality of our success for your own two eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaypY2282VW
40,AfroCentric Leimert Park ...,You'll find the most interesting AfroCentric articles here and see lots of folks dressed in tribal attire which is nice. Ethnic eateries in the Park and surrounding area. I'd stop off here for a while on the way home from work. Fun! ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Family,"Drumming, arts, food, incense, spirituality, Afrika is present, family, family, family, family...I love this area of Los Angeles whenever I visit. It is one the only places besides the beaches where I feel at home when visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eslala
50,Vacation,"Cultural, Artsy, and colorful are adjectives that describe this historical landmark. Beautiful shops to pick up Afrocentric clothing - we especially loved the shop 'Back to Kemet' ran by Ankh and Azzizah, a lovely couple whose peaceful and tranquil attitude made us feel welcomed. What a lovely couple. The prices of their clothing was reasonable too. A real find was Azzizah's popcorn which was so good I had to order some to takeback home to family and friends. Hands down it was the best I'd ever tasted. I'll definitely return to Leimert Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/837karimar
