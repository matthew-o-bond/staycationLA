40,Great place to walk around with family,"It is a good neighborhood park for good family activities like ball games, walking , take the dog. It has restrooms and BBQ grill. A covered pavilion and plenty of recreation facilities for little ones to slide, swing, or spin. It is in a very safe neighborhood.",slee328
30,Interesting bit of small town history in Conejo Valley,Nice place for a casual visit and picnic in the park. The adobe is preserved extremely well by the local population.,Roger E
30,"If interested, bundle this in with a few other things","I learned about The Reyes Adobe via the ""Passport 2 History"" which has many local museums and historical sites in it that you wouldn't know existed! I always try to be fair in my rating system and rate things based off their potential. For example, I recently rated the (somewhat) nearby Pleasant Valley Historical Society Museum and Botanical Gardens a 5 because they're really doing the most with what they have. I hate to give a free museum less than 4 stars, but there just wasn't that much to do or see at this one. They had some cool things, but really nothing hands on.The tour begins with a 10 minute video, which we didn't make it through as I had my 3 year old with us. The house itself had some neat things to see, and I learned some interesting things... The highlights for me was learning that the phrase ""sleep tight"" comes from the old beds that literally are on ropes that you can adjust! And that the bread was divided based on status... the workers got the more burnt bottom part, and so on up, which is where we get ""the upper crust"". Make sure you see the original mission bell outside that was moved here for an eagle scout project in 1988. Also, the artifacts in the original barn (where the welcome center is) is probably the coolest part. I really enjoyed the room behind the main room that has special events. That room was pretty relaxing for some reason.After visiting a bunch of these, I just felt that The Reyes Adobe was a bit less exciting than the others with less to do. I hear they have an amazing Halloween festival, so we'll have to check that out! If you're into history, this is definitely a place you can explore. I would personally bundle this in with a few surrounding museums and that will make for a nice day! But my toddler wasn't really having this one.Very nice folks who worked here though! A+ for them!",Michael T
50,Hosts a great family event each year,"Beyond the typical early California history available, it hosts a multi of events. This includes Art exhibits and the Annual Reyes Adobe Days festival with concerts, kid activities, and a beer garden. Nice weather, people, and venue.",Cesar C
50,Beautiful and educational historic site,"My family and I have visited several times for different events, it's like going back in time. A good chance to see it is during the annual Reyes Adobe Days in the month of October when it's open to the public.",Al M

10,Website is wrong--call before you go,Website says open on Tuesday but sign on gate says only on weekends.Really lame...Not that hard to update a website quickly.Luckily I went to Wildwood park and Paradise falls.,Summerasalifestyle
40,Right in the middle of community,"We'd seen the historical marker sign for years driving up and down Reyes Adobe from and to the 101 Freeway and decided finally to go check it out. Nice small museum and grounds with lots of historical photographs from when there was just a house sitting in the middle of the meadow back at the turn of the century. To see everything does not take long, 15-30 minutes max, but it was very interesting.",ZumaDawg
50,Reyes Adobe Days,The Adobe is fascinating. Docents were well informed and very happy to share the history. The park and surroundings are beautiful.,DonnaAnne
50,Historical Gem,The adobe from California's history is a true gem. It is often overlooked by it's cousin adobe nearby Leonis Adobe in Calabasas. But don't overlook this venue. Go to the website of the adobe to find out the open hours (which are limited) and come by. It was restored meticulously by the City of Agoura Hills after the Northridge Earthquake and is a true gem of area history.,DrSteve818
40,A Little Gem in the Heart of Agoura,This historic spot is well worth the short amount of time it takes to tour it. The setting is pleasant and it's a nice reminder of how things were in Agoura not that long ago.,Kay
40,"Reyes Adobe, Local History","The Reyes Adobe tells the story of Local Agoura Hills story. The house was built here because it was beside a stream, the only source of water in the area.The tour begins in the former barn which has a room with artifacts and a small class room. The tour took us through an adobe home, typical of mid-19th century California. When built, none of the rooms connected, they were clustered abound a courtyard. The cooking was outside, which was typical of the time.",Kenneth L
