50,Deemed Pro-Cathedral in 2007,"We visited early morning and it looked marvellous in the glow of the sunrise. It has grand stone craft and an impressive belfry.It was completed in 1925 and named as a Pro-Cathedral in 2007, the dedication for which took place early the following year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,A House of Beauty,"St John’s Cathedral is beautiful architecturally and spiritually, embodying a central concept of Episcopal worship. It’s worth a visit for either the aesthetic tour or a service.We went in the middle of Lent, and despite the austere shrouding were struck by the warmth, diversity and energy of the congregation. In the pews with us were both fresh-faced USC students and elegantly hatted church ladies in an astonishing mix of Angelenos seeming of every color and persuasion. Afterwards the Dean greeted us telling us some of the history of the church and inviting us to go into the choir back of the altar and the Lady Chapel for a closer look at the gold colored mosaics. We were engaged gently and respectfully as if we were already members. If we lived here, we would be. They really seem to walk the talk of welcome.Completed in 1924 the building is a stunning example of the Romanesque Revival with many elements intentionally modeled after identifiable early medieval Northern Italian churches. In particular it is well-known that the large, lacework rose window with the symbols of the four Evangelists in the corners of the frame derives from the 13th century façade of San Pietro in the hill town of Tuscania northwest of Rome. And the wooden beamed ceiling is identified with a church in Florence. These are not copies as much as admiring references. One significant difference is the carving of the Pontius Pilate line from the creed above the logia section, which seemed especially appropriate for the season. For the architects, Walter and Pierpont Davis, the cathedral is their most important work. However, the Patriotic Hall everyone sees at the intersection of the 10 and 110 is also theirs.When we visited, a banner calling for gun control was installed above the main entrance. We later learned this was not just a convenient statement for the times. The church has a long history of standing against war and violence, most notably when it closed its doors in the middle of the Viet Nam war, not opening them again until its conclusion.Sunday services are at 8:00 and 11.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdgarCosset
