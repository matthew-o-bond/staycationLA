50,THE place to rent bikes for a trail adventure in Topanga!,"Our family (4 adults) stopped in on a trip to LA to rent bikes for some fun in the canyons around Topanga. This place is the real deal: Chris, the owner, has been in business for 20 years, and the manager, Andrew, set us up with 4 hard-tail, front suspension bikes with 1x 11-speed setups for our adventure. He carefully explained a 10-mile loop that fit our ability level (athletic riders but not too technical), gave us a map (with pictures of all trail junctions so we wouldn’t get lost), and sent us on our way. Bikes performed flawlessly, the trails were amazing with great views and some gnarly descents, and we got in about 1,500 feet of climbing). Chris and Andrew were the perfect mountain biking ambassadors, and run probably the hippest bike shop we’ve ever been to: great selection of bikes and equipment, friendly dogs, indoor/outdoor setting in a beautiful area, AND they also have a leather shop and offer really cool belts, wallets, and other handcrafted goods for your consideration. I love this place - highly recommended!",Tony C
50,Mountain Biking,"Can’t rate Chris and his team enough!From coffee and banana bread on arrival to fully briefed pre-rides and great maps, these guys do it best!They encourage you to use their spot like it was your own. Arrive, relax and let them take care of your bike needs. Bikes are all in super condition and equipment is available to hire. They trust you to take care of the kit and simply love that you’re there to share time with them and get the best experience.The rides of course are top notch too and adhering to their advice you will get the best from your time there. On return to the Outpost you are rewarded with a welcome from the shop dog and more banana bread while you cool down and chill.The best awards ceremony follows with a noteworthy congrats on having completed the trail and a certificate with authentic calligraphy signature is handed to you.Do take time to visit the shop. They make their own leather goods on site and their shirts are awesome.Will definitely return if in the area again",Kersten C
50,This place is the best!,"Topanga Creek Outpost is the only bike shop you'll need for some GREAT riding in southern California. Awesome staff that goes above and beyond to make sure you have a high end FS mountain bike, clear turn by turn directions, and (best of all) they're located within riding distance of the Topanga State Park trailhead. ..so no bike rack needed! No reason not to ride when they make it this easy. Also, gift shop has some cool souvenirs, even some made right in the shop. Definitely look forward to returning to this place...plenty more trails tocheck out in Topanga.",GreekamericanMom
50,A Cycling Oasis in Topanga Canyon,"I have been coming to Topanga Creek Outpost for a few years now using them to rent bikes every time I'm in Southern California. They cater to off-road cyclists (though they also carry on-road touring bikes) and have bikes and gear for rent and for sale. But where TCO really shines is in customer service and bike touring events. Every Saturday they host a no-drop club ride that has to be the most fun, most no-attitude, most inclusive shop ride I've ever been a part of. They also do light overnight bike camping trips every Wednesday. I'm not a camper so I haven't done these.The crew is just top notch. The owner, Chris, is sweet, helpful, and fun. Jay and the rest of the staff are simply amazing at how willing they are to answer questions, solve problems, and offer support. The bikes available for rent are all top notch and in great working order plus they supply pedals and helmets if you don't have your own. Every time I've been in the shop there has been fresh baked banana bread waiting for every visitor. And let's not forget that TCO has the best shop dog EVER!. LOLBut you came to ride, right? TCO will show you the way on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Other days, they will give you maps and detailed directions for any kind of ride you'd like to do from the simplest stroll to the most challenging single track. I've been there dozens of times now, and I've always left having gotten in a beautiful, fun ride on a super, jammin' bike. These guys are great.I've also seen random acts of kindness from them, most notably when Jay completely re-did the gear cables of a rider who wandered in with a broken bike 1/2 hour after closing. Treat TCO like the good neighbors they are and you will get an amazing response back.If you're looking to do some off-road cycling while in Southern California, my recommendation for Topanga Creek Outpost is without reservation.",stradfiddler
