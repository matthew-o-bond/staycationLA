50,A not too well known gem,"La Galeria Gitana is a wonderful art gallery, it is hidden from the street but easily accessible. Parking is available adjacent to San Fernando City Hall or on Maclay Street. Besides wonderful art on display and for sale, all of it, the operator also conducts art classes and yoga classes. The gallery changes the art on displayed grouped by a Theme approximately every three months, so there is always something new to require another visit. The proprietor is gracious and welcoming, always.",Theale H
50,Beauty in the Heart of San Fernando,"La Galeria Gitana is situated in a small shopping center within walking distance of the courthouse, City Hall, and the SFPD. It's a small gallery that has rotating, juried art shows every couple of months. It's steps from Compania de Cafe.Whether you're on jury duty, or dropping a car off to get serviced, the Galeria is a great time diversion for 45 minutes to an hour.Really beautiful works by local artists are featured, and admission is free. Occasional community events occur in the evenings.Curator Angie takes over the reigns this month, and has a long history within the NE SFV. I'm looking forward to what she brings to this little treasure.",halobb
