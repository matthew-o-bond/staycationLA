40,Thoroughly enjoyed a concert!,Don't get discouraged by negative reviews on early concerts at this venue. Parking was a breeze (surprisingly slow) and had friends meeting me both from south and north. Both found parking within minutes of exiting freeway. I took the new metro line and was easy.Yes drinks and food are expensive but no more so than any other sporting event or concert. Standard stadium pricing and no surprises.Security was very tight and felt comfortable.Acoustics weren't the best but if you're into the band you're going to see you will fully enjoy. Don't hesitate to see your band here.The Field Bar & Restaurant was open prior to our night concert for pre-drinks and food and we hit the mexican restaurant and bar a couple blocks away before that.Overall very smooth and enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agvaleri24
40,Quite a newcomer,"A modern stadium unveiled in 2018, it has a capacity of 22,000. It is the home of soccer tournaments as well as other sports like rugby.Some track events of the 2028 Olympics will be played out here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Caught a concert - Iron Maiden,"What a perfect size Stadium for a concert. Facilities were spectacular. Plenty of restrooms, great vendors, nice acoustics. My friends and I really enjoyed the concert and the setting. Easy to get to on the train and very friendly people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimWPPA
50,Great new stadium,Seats about 22.000 and it has an amazing acoustic.Seats are very nice and the views are great - no one or no thing is in your way.Go have fun at one of the games..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OCDane
50,Modern Soccer Stadium in the Heart of Los Angeles,"Most negative reviews seem to be from people who visited the stadium for concerts. I haven't been to a concert at the Banc, but I've been to a few soccer games and this facility is spectacular. There are really no bad seats as the stadium is designed to bring the audience closer to the action on the field. Going to an LAFC soccer game adds to the experience. The atmosphere of the team's supporters group and the crowd, in general, intensifies the vibe as it gets pretty exciting and quite festive. There are plenty of great food and snacks options - which are little on the pricier side, in my opinion - nevertheless very competitive when compared to other sporting events. In addition, there is a food-hall type restaurant & brewery adjacent to the stadium which can be accessed from the outside and makes a good spot for a pregame stop. There were some complaints about access to parking and that traffic around the stadium is slow, but in my experiences, I've never had this problem. The parking prices tend to rise in the private lots around the stadium, especially closer to event start time. The stadium does offer parking on the lots it operates, but you would have to pay in advance and purchase through their parking operator. There is a Metro stop about 10-min walk to the stadium (Expo Line to Expo Park/USC Station) and Lyft has a designated spot conveniently located adjacent to the stadium. I was a little surprised at some of the negative reviews on here, but for me, going to the Banc to watch a soccer game has always been a great experience and highly recommended - even for those who are not necessarily soccer fanatics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/341ovidiug
30,"Comfortable seats, large venue","We visited Banc of California Stadium for a recent concert. This was our first time there and the stadium is clean with nice, cushioned seats. It was a little challenging to find our area - they could use better signage & directions. To get out of the stadium after the event, they had 1 exit for too many people. This coupled with others filing into our area to go to the VIP backstage section. Better flow of crowds and additional exits would be helpful. The bar closed earlier than 30 minutes before the end of the concert; you couldn't even get water. For hot nights, like the night we were there, it would have been nice to at least have water available for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatB924
40,Mumford & Sons Concert,Good venue for a large concert. Parking was efficient but SO expensive- $10 signs were covered over with $40 tariffs- what a joke!Facilities inside were adequate but food choices pretty limited. Selling big cups of drink with no lids or straws for environmental reasons is commendable but totally impractical!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikecG5921IR
40,Downtown LA Stadium with Lots of Food Options,"New stadium with a lot of amenities and great views from the midfield box. Came here for the LAFC vs San Jose game on a Wednesday night. We took the metro from downtown Santa Monica to the Expo Park/USC station. It was about 40 minutes and definitely beat trying to brave rush hour traffic heading to DTLA. It was about a 15 minute walk to the stadium and a nice walk, as we passed by the Rose Garden and various museums to get to the entrance. The Fields LA is right in front of the entrance, and you don’t need a ticket to get in. It’s a food hall with highly esteemed food options, bathrooms, and water stations. When you go through security, you hand the security guard your phone and bag then walk through the metal detector. There is a strict bag policy so be sure to read the website regarding the rules. The transparent bag rule was strictly enforced. The view from the midfield box is awesome - and the unlimited hot dogs, pretzels, and popcorn. You ask the people with the bags to come bring you the food (although know that they did run out of hot dogs at the end of the night). There are ketchup and mustard packets but no onions. The pretzel was a bit dry and very salty, while the popcorn was very buttery and also salty. I highly recommend getting the dole whip soft serve ($6) - I think it’s better than the one at Disneyland. It was so thick and creamy with the perfect pineapple flavor. The prices are what you’d expect from stadiums - bottled Dasani was $4, micheladas were $18, and candy was $4. There are water fountains and plenty of bathrooms. The seats in the midfield box were also padded which was comfortable. Getting out of the stadium was a nightmare - it took forever to get a lyft. You can go to the designated lyft station in front of Lot 6 and there are two people who direct where the lyft cars park so you can walk to them. There’s WiFi but just for the lyft app. I would recommend either walking a bit away and calling a lyft from elsewhere or perhaps leaving earlier to ensure you get a lyft before surge pricing hits. Customer service is a bit standoffish but given that there’s a large mass of people that need to be helped, it’s understandable. Overall a really nice, new stadium that was a fun experience for watching a soccer game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shanellesua
20,What good food choices are the reviewers talking about???,"Clean, but food selection and quality, sound system and Lyft center suck big time!!! Would not ever go to another event here again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/izg2014
50,Great Stadium,"Enjoyed a concert here:) No soccer, lol. Even from the back, you have a nice view of the stage. Beautiful design, easy in and out. Recommend taking a Lyft or Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marlaher
10,Zero Organization,"The absolute worst concert going experience. We purchased the $35 prepaid parking along with the tickets for Mumford & Sons 8/3 show. We exited the freeway at 7:20pm. Sat in gridlock, trying to get to the Prepaid Lot which was less than 2 blocks away, as we frustratingly look at what appears to be traffic cops on all four corners of the intersection doing nothing. One problem, along with all the other ones, is that everyone was trying to get into the same parking lot even though it’s only for “prepaid.” We finally drove into the parking lot at 8:40pm. Yeah, an hour and 20 minutes after exiting! To go 2 blocks! Walked in and seated by 9:05pm. We missed the opening band. I’m sure a lot of people did. Why wasn’t there any traffic control? Why wasn’t there a “Prepaid Parking” sign instead of a “6?” Who the heck knows what that’s even supposed to mean? M&S were great. The acoustics not so much. We left early to avoid having to sit through another clusterf*ck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamREL
50,Great Soccer Vibe,"Flew in to catch a game with my daughter as she is a huge FC Cincinnati fan and wanted to enjoy SoCal and a game. Uber or Lyft to and from was very easy as not knowing the city and best option. LAFC fans were very loud, raucous during the game and quite fun vibe, and were very friendly to the opposing team fans. Food and drinks are what you’d expect but we didn’t come for fine dining. Surely a must-experience even if not a soccer fan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S3508GZcatherineg
20,Be Faithful to the L.A. Galaxy,"So we have been l.a. Galaxy fans for years but decided to check out the new kids on the block, lafc, at their new stadium, Banc of California Stadium. The energy was great when we arrived and paid $40 to park (what??) A lot of people were tailgating.We paid a lot for a level of seats called ‘Figueroa Club.’ The seats had a perfect view of the field.The food options in the Figueroa Club were terrible. My husband had a bratwurst sausage and I opted for some super salty waffle fries and soggy brussel sprouts.The bar took forever to get a drink. There was no system of lining up and at one point a man from the back just yelled in his order and it was filled before others’ who were next.After halftime, the bathrooms flooded and there was no bathroom available on our level.We left five minutes early (missed a goal), and realized that driving one block would take 30 minutes as the traffic police were basically just hanging out.So, sorry, l.a. Galaxy. We are returning and wish we never left!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKS353
50,Amazing Crowd and Atmosphere,"I'm not a fan of soccer however when my friends invited me to a game I took their invitation. The stadium is modern, great architecture. It offers very good views all around the entire stadium. Every single seat offers a panoramic view of the field and feels like you are in the actions. Our favorite is the North Side section - the supporters section. Its lively, plenty of drums and sounds like everyone having a wonderful time.Concessions are plenty with good food and drinks selection. Easy access by taking the Metro. Definitely would love to come back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/russypooh
30,Rolling Loud Festival,Stadium was easy to find. Set up was good. Lots of security around so I felt safe even though the area didn't seem like the best.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigDob
50,Great stadium,"This brand new stadium was built exclusively for the new franchise and sits right next door to the historic Los Angeles Coliseum. The views are fantastic. The seats are reasonably comfortable, and the food choices are far better than your average stadium. Parking is limited inside the stadium, arrive early. We paid $30 to park outside of the stadium. The fans are very friendly and the 3252 super fans maintain the vibe the entire game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcT3983ND
10,Disappointed,"Heard a lot of good things about this new stadium,got to say not impressed. The chairs were very flimsy, could tell oners cut corners trying to finish build in time. Not to mention parking is a nightmare, be ready to spend $50+ just to park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trashb0at
40,I'm a fan,"I never really followed any sport till about 2014 for the world cup. When this stadium was built and now we have a REAL LA team, I became a fan. Getting there is easy and inexpensive. I take the metro-rail in and run into many LAFC fans. It drops you off about a block away. Parking can be pricey anywhere in DTLA especially near a stadium. Besides if you want to go eat before or after the game, the metro will take you there @ half the cost. The stadium itself is pretty new and has a variety of food options if you decide to eat there.The atmosphere is awesome from my experience. The LAFC store is pretty big and has a variety of stuff. They can also personalize your jersey. FYI, for first timers. Guest are only allowed to take in clear plastic bags and they can't be so big. check the LAFC site for measurements. If you forget or take the wrong size, they have a trailer with rental lockers for $5. Go check it out its an experience =).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grappler9
50,Stadium Extraordinary,"What a Stadium. The Banc of California Stadium home to the LAFC soccer team of the MLS is outstanding. It seats about 22,000 but any seat in the house is a great seat. The way the Stadium was constructed makes it easy to maneuver around and see all the action. There are plenty of food and beverages in the Stadium and also on the outside you have many choices as well. Great little bar with many beer choices and next to that you have plenty of food. Also you have plenty of parking in the surrounding areas, but if you can take the Metro. If you have a chance enjoy an event there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guseboy
50,First LA FC Game Live,"I am not a huge sports fan, but I do love going to live games, so when my friend from Canada was coming to So Cal for a visit with her 15-year-old son I thought it would be a great way to spend an evening! I was right!What a great night!!! We were lucky enough to get club seats and sat in the center of the field about ten rows up. You could see every inch of the field and fans and feel all the energy and excitement of the game. Beer lineups weren't bad at all. Of course, its stadium prices for pints, but that's to be expected (about $40.00 for 3 beers).Be careful when you put your beer in the cup holder though because it's likely to spill if there is a goal, even if only 3/4 full.The supporters section is almost as entertaining to watch as the game! Even if you are like me, and don't know much about the league or the game, it is totally worth a trip on the metro to the stadium for an easy walk from the Expo Park/USC Stadium stop.It's a great venue and a really good time! Lots of energy in the crowd, the team looks good to me and we won the game that I watched! My understanding is LAFC is a new team on the block when it comes to professional soccer so there are still empty seats in the stands, but after the evening experience I had, I can't imagine it will be long until they sell out seats for every game!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980raegank
50,The New Place to Watch Soccer,Just recently spent a long weekend in LA that included watching our first LAFC (Los Angeles Football Club) soccer game. This brand new stadium was built exclusively for the new franchise and sits right next door to the historic Los Angeles Coliseum and just a few blocks from the heart of the USC campus. This is a very family friendly place that has comfortable seating and an atmosphere that should work well for many years to come. On the roof of the stadium they feature outdoor seating and entertainment that contributes to the positive vibe. I understand they are in the final stages of a new food court that will allow ticket holders a whole new eating experience. The fans are very friendly and the super fans maintain the vibe the entire game. The score ended 0 - 0 but the game was still fun and worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lgoldman
50,Beautiful Views of DTLA with Good Food Options,"I am an LAFC season ticket holder and come to the games at this stadium regularly. The views are fantastic. The seats are reasonably comfortable, and the food choices are far better than your average stadium. The concessions are almost like having a few good food trucks to order from. Also, it's easy to take the Expo line here at get off at the USC/Exposition Park stop, even for me (who doesn't typically take public transportation anywhere in LA). Even better, they have a decent craft beer selection that offers craft brews in pint cans. I have yet to have anything less than a really pleasant experience here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,"Great stadium, atmosphere and location","I attended the first few home matches for LAFC. This stadium is phenomenal. It's light and breezy and there are no bad views.Parking tip: Between Broadway and Main, there are plenty of available spaces for street parking on weeknights and weekends. 10 minute walk to save 30 dollars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
40,The newest soccer venue in Los Angeles,The stadium is located next door to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It is where the sports arena used to be. There are parking lots available for a price. The entrance to the stadium for common folk is on the north side. There are many concession stands scattered throughout the stadium's concourse. The seating area has some roofing and individual seats. Where I sat a significant portion of the field which was unviewable. There are big screen televisions on the two ends and scoreboards there and on the two sides of the field. The staff is friendly and helpful which is a good thing because I found the stadium's signage to be inadequate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ransom007
50,LAFC home stadium.,"Nice venue, modern touches in downtown LA. LAFC is playing well, friendly atmosphere. No thuggery. Professional and helpful staff. Arrive a little early. Founders club is swanky, full bar. Good eats. Good sight lines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872deanm
50,Best Stadium experience in California,"I just went to the BOC stadium with my son to watch the home match against Minnesota and I was blown away! He has great seats in the corner, but after walking around, there isn’t a bad seat in the house. Once the match started LAFC fans get loud and stay that way all game, very Euro and we loved it.The amenities are well placed, and in a full stadium lines were short.The best part of the BOC is it was privately funded and and built, no handouts from taxpayers (Spanos doesn’t get this concept.) The Owner’s put an excellent team on the field day 1. LAFC is only one point back in second place, playing 2 less games than the leader.LAFC is great fun to watch, the game is fast and exciting, oh and it’s affordable!This is one of the best values in Los Angeles, don’t miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan
40,"Innagural Match, Great Atmosphere","We attended the first match held at this new soccer specific stadium as away fans and had a mostly enjoyable time. I think it will take some time for the stadium and the fans to come into their own, but the 3252 supporters group had a great first outing really bringing the energy level up to where it should be at a match. Looking around the rest of the stadium though seeing everyone sitting down was disappointing. 24oz craft beers will set you back about $15, not too terrible for some good options and generous pours. The kitchens however were not ready for opening day as lines were long due to order back logs, and that was just for a burger. Looking forward to coming back though as it is easy to get to and from via uber or metro being so close to USC.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239lennyp
50,Awesome,They did an amazing jon on the stadium. The food in the club is great. What a great new experience for LA soccer fans. Lots of places to grab a beer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shack12016
