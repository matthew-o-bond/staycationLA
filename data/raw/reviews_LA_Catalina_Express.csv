50,Efficient & friendly,"Trip to Catalina began with a ferry ride! The rough ride, no fault of the ferry, was eased by the accommodating staff who were certainly polite & eased us efficiently into port. The return was less bumpy & pleasant. Help with baggage & smiles helped!!!!",pamwhj
50,Cruising in comfort,"Catalina is 30 miles and a world away from southern California, getting there can be a challenge. Catalina Express isn't the cheapest but is one of the fastest and most comfortable ways to get to your island adventure. Be sure to book in advance.",Wandering traveler
40,Comfortable ride,"Meets the expectations- fast and comfortable ride out to the island. Runs on time. We paid extra for the premium package, which wasn’t worth it. Maybe because we didn’t take an alcoholic drink. Snack was a one ounce package of cookies or snack mix.",E-Lynn-Br

50,Day trip,Went over to Catalina for the day and enjoyed the trip on the Catalina Express. The ride was smooth and about an hour long. Will definitely do this again,Ellen W
50,Efficient Service to the Island,"I use the express for occasional work appointments. The boat is expensive compared with ferries in other states. I suggest you purchase your tickets online, to make sure there are seats available. Parking is adjacent to the building. It is the only option unless you ride share to the location. I typically drive to the top level rather than looking for a random spot. Parking is expensive.It is suggested you arrive an hour before the boat departs, but if you already have tickets 30-45 minutes in advance is sufficient.There is a small cafe inside the building, and there is food on the boat.The ride is fairly smooth, but it can get choppy in the early morning and late afternoon hours. If you get seasick I suggest you sit outside, though it can get chilly. You can take some dried ginger to help with the seasickness.The ride is just over an hour. Bring along a magazine or a book and the time will zip by.Once on Catalina it is easy to find things to do, within walking distance. On your return to Long Beach, you only need to line up 30 minutes in advance.",luv2trvlRedondoBeach
50,Perfect Service to Catalina,Travel to Catalina is reached by ferry for most tourists. We took the Catalina Express and found check in to be easy and efficient. Be sure to book in advance for best selection of travel times.,Bev W
50,Excellent portabello burger; wonderful service,"While waiting for the boat to Catalina Island, we ate lunch in the small restaurant at the Catalina Express Long Beach after checking in. (We also ate here again on our way back because we enjoyed it so much and we had some time to spend before heading to our next stop.)Both times we had the portabello burger because we enjoyed it so much. (So much so that I want to make these at home now instead of having hamburger.) The size was just perfect, too. The fries were also wonderful.On our first visit here before heading to the island, I had their version of chips and salsa. I was expecting typical Tex-Mex chips, but these were more like heavy pita chips, so I did not care for these.Our server both times was Jean, who has worked at the restaurant and bar for more than 30 (maybe 40) years. She was absolutely delightful and so service-oriented, making sure we were well taken care of. (She told us her husband has worked on the boats for the same amount of time.)",Lynn M
50,Worth getting the Commodore Lounge tickets,"This is a nice 70 minute ride from Long Beach to Avalon (Catalina). Very nice and comfortable ferry. It thinks it's worth buying the seats for the Commodore Lounge for a little bit more than the regular seating.What you get for this: Priority boarding, upper deck indoor seating, a free drink.",Pierre D
50,Son station in Germany visiting us,We went to Catalina island and took a boat to get there it was an amazing experience we enjoyed the view and the sea experience was awesome...very friendly staff aboard and you can enjoy a glass of wine on your way,albasoto3573
50,Anniversary,The check in was easy as well the boarding. Super fast friendly and definitely recommend to go. We had to change our return and it easy as well. You only pay 5 for changing your ticket which is not bad. Can’t wait to book next summer!,Jackie M
50,"Expensive, yes: But clean and friendly bar services","I mean...if ‘ya want to get to Catalina Island, you really don’t have too many choices, now do you. That said, Catalina Express seemed well-managed in terms of ticketing, the waiting area, and the queuing process. The boat itself has clean bathrooms and a variety of seating areas (there’s a VIP lounge if you have the $$). The boats have Swiss efficiency in terms of timing so don’t be late. Note: there’s no cover over the outdoor queuing area (that I could see) so please remember to use your sunscreen!",ARLVAGUY
50,prompt and pleasant,good boat that keeps it schedule and has very pleasant staff. Good drinks available and Commodore lounge upgrade is worth it,Jody
30,One of the only ways to get to Catalina!!!,Either you fly or take a boat to Catalina. This port is easy to use and park at. The boats are nice and pretty quick. The view is very nice. The prices are a but high for my blood but this is one of the only way to get there. Catalina is pretty fun for a day trip or there are places to stay there that are nice if you want to stay longer.,David R

Most folks I saw were able to get on standby.",Maria C
50,Going first class to Avalon,"We were making an overnight trip to Catalina, and wanted the most comfortable way to travel. This is it - spend the extra few dollars for the Commodore Lounge. There you can choose either airliner style seats or the lounge tables aft.Enjoy free beverages and a smooth and comfortable ride. Even if there is an ocean swell, the ride is still pretty smooth.",CaliforniaMike2013
40,Fun but disappointing,"First things fist - I love being on the water. If nothing else happened, the trip out to the Pacific was beautiful and I got to see a lot of the Long Beach Coast. We did see some common dolphins and some bottle nosed dolphins. That was exciting. I always love to see dolphins. We also saw a Mola Mola and the crew was very excited about that. The one thing I wanted to see was a whale. That did not happen. I know that it is random and they can’t guarantee a whale will be there when they are. Still...it was a disappointment. That said, the folks on the boat were friendly and helpful. I would go again.",BethDulo
30,Catalina Island,"We took the ferry from San Pedro. It takes about an hour and fifteen minutes to Avalon, the town. We rented a golf cart and explored the island which was fun. Very hilly and overlooking steep drops. That took about an hour then we ate at a Mexican restaurant just off the pedestrian area. We did a bit of shopping, hats and tee shirts and such. Then we had to wait for two hours for the next ferry. So, Catalina is fun but once your done goofing around on golf carts, shopping and eating there's not much else to do.",susanseestheworld
50,Smooth and Fast,Best way to get to CatalinaShort ride and very good rideIt gives lots of time on the island if you are just going for the day,Gary P
50,Loved it,"I found this while in Long Beach and I would have paid doubleto have this experience (ok, not double, but I liked it:). I did the Commodore Lounge option with a free snack and drink. I'm not sure if it was worth it, but I have no regrets. It was a quick and comfortable ride to Catalina. Catalina Island is a must see and this was an ideal way to get there. FYI - get yo'self to Catalina ;)",sweetnsourlady
40,Gets you there pretty well,"The catamaran boat is fast. Certainly much faster than those old boats. The boat is fairly clean. I prefer the Commodore Lounge: it's enclosed, air-conditioned and a lot quieter (like an airplane in seating). They, I don't know if it's completely worth the price, just for a ""free drink and a small bag of Chex mix."" Summer months it's crowded. The crew is nice. I wish the passengers were nicer. Some noisy, drunken frat boys coming back to port sort of ruined the trip.",David T

30,Catalina Express Ferry Service,"The location is a bit difficult to get to since its by the shipping ports. GPS took us to a different port area, and then rerouted us. The ferry ride was easy and fast, but I have to say that ferry boat was a little on the dirty side. I do take into account that it does several trips a day to and from the island, but nonetheless I found it to be dirty.Overall, though, not bad, the employees are courteous and polite and get you on and off quickly.",Doll1227
40,Good Facility and Good Service,"Good boat, good facility and good servcie. On time performance. Not cheap, but worth the price. Recommended.",Dana Los Angeles
50,Lovely ride to Catalina,"The Catalina Express is a great way to get to Catalina Island. We were in the upper first class section, which is air-conditioned and provides snacks and adult beverages. The ride is very smooth and the windows were clean enough to allow for taking pictures through the glass. The ride was just under an hour.",PamRoad
50,Very nice ride to Catalina,"We enjoyed the ride. The free bus doesn't get very close, at least not the one from the queen mary. Be prepared for a bit of walking or use Lyft.",RoseBC23
50,Compliment,Trip back to Long Beach California from a couple days on Catalina island enjoying the boat ride back and over saw Elizabeth B a crew member on your fleet going above and beyond anyone I ever saw the whole time here not just asking how we were doing but having a wonderful conversation with a family and children next to us. Makes the trip that more memorable and fun. She’s an example of what every employee should be like! Thank you Elizabeth B,Blake B
40,"Quick Ride, although bumpy.",My husband and I took a visit to Catalina Island for our 5th honeymoon. We were able to find the dock relatively easily. There is lots of parking in the parking garage right outside of the area used to load up the boats. There were even guides there who would help you book activities on the island. When we loaded up the boat it went relatively quickly. We were able to get a window seat at about the middle of the boat. Once we began we saw dolphins swimming alongside the boat. It was very beautiful. My only complaint (and it isn't the boats fault) is how rough the ride was in general. I had horrible sea sickness and had to do everything I could not to throw up. Other then that it was beautiful and quick.,Ann Mendoza
50,Catalina express,My aunt bought tickets for the boat ride and we got lost getting to the terminal but the ticket office were very obliging in letting us on the next ferry. We saw a pod of dolphins and had a good time. The ferries are frequent and can go back on any from Catalina. Catalina is a pretty island worth a visit,Chris J
10,Was talked into buying a commuter book I cannot use.,"I travel to the island frequent for business. On this particular day I used Catalina Express. I made my reservations online and on the day of travel I went to the terminal counter to pick up my tickets. The woman at the window commented on my attire (business attire) and I explained that I travel to the island often for work. As she was printing my tickets, she suggested I purchase the commuter book of tickets. I asked if my husband and daughter would be able to use the tickets as well, and I was assured that they would. The woman explained that I could call and make the reservations for them, and then they would simply tear out the ticket from the commuter book and trade them in at the ticket window inside the terminal. I explained that we travel separately because of my work, and she insisted that it would not be an issue. Because my travel expenses are covered by my employer, I also explained that my interest in the commuter book was primarily for my husband and daughter and that in almost all cases we travel seperately. The woman again assured me that this would be the perfect solution and I would save money! She asked for their names as she was typing I believed she was entering their names into the account information.I spoke to two different agents who each explained that despite what I was told, my husband and daughter cannot, under any circumstances, use the tickets in the commuter book. I was informed that their names are not included in the account. Both phone agents I spoke with were very nice and each did some research, but both had the same answer. I was also told that because I am the purchaser we must always travel together so that our ID's can be checked. As I stated to the ticket window agent, we do not ever travel to the island together. I have noted that the inside of the coupon book states, ""commuter coupon is limited to person purchasing same, purchaser's spouse, and two other members of purchaser's immediately family under the age of 21 and residing in the same household"".I emailed the company and explained my issue, and asked for assistance in resolving the issue. I have also called several times but have not received a phone call or email in response. I have lost $300 for a ticket book I cannot use.",LynnE63California
50,Served The Purpose,"Not a party boat, however. The crew was courteous and informative. The seating was comfortable. Got us to Catalina Island safely. Definitely served the purpose.",Terry H
50,Day Trip to Catalina Island,"Catalina Island is beautiful! I traveled round trip aboard the Catalina Express from and to Long Beach on 15 April 2019. The boat ride was very comfortable. Someone onboard, who represented a tour company, sold me a two tours: one for the Casino and one for the Skyline Bus Tour. Both were excellent! Catalina Island is a treasure, right here in the USA.",DumNiece
50,Loved this trip,I loved taking this trip to Catalina. They try to sell you a vip ticket but we didn't get it and I'm so glad. Why would you want to sit inside when you can be in the open air with the sea and the sun and the feeling of being alive. The people who did buy the upgrade ended up coming out side after all and we just laughed. I would go again in a minute.,lisa g
50,Comfortable Commodore Lounge,"We had a great travel on the way to the island via Catalina Express. The price you pay for the Commodore Seating is worth it. It’s comfortable, wonderful view from the top of the ferry and it was great to view island and ocean with a glass of champagne.",Travelshoe88
40,Quick ride on a clean boat!,"We took the ferry to Avalon, Catalina Island. The tickets were easy to purchase, the staff courteous and organized. Staff assisted people with special needs during the boarding process. There was a grill in the lobby on the Long Beach side if you need to grab a bite before you leave. They offer salads and burgers. The food was about what you would expect for a ferry terminal. The boat was clean and staff came around periodically. The trip took about an hour and seeing the pod of Common Dolphin on our way out was great!",LoveToTravelTerrie

40,Express Escape,"The only negative (minor) is the location of the Long Beach dock. Not easily accessible by foot from aquarium/shoreline attractions. However the Catalina dock location is great.Service is great from ticket purchase to embarkation to onboard care to exit. The boat moves along at a high speed and the trip can be windy if you have an outside seat. Seat selection is on first-come basis so I suggest staying alert regarding boarding announcements.We opted to pay a little extra for Commodore seating on the return. You get a drink, treats and seating that is marginally more comfortable for a few extra bucks.Overall a nice ride and Catalina is a fantastic break from the mainland!",Hank H

50,Weekend trip to Catalina,"Traveling to the Catalina Island, was a breeze with the Catalina Express. No issues. Schedule was Timely. Accommodations inside fine. Water was a little rough going toward the island on our trip, so there was an outdoor area that was better to avoid seasickness. Our trip from the island back to shore, was smooth sailing. We were told, when I called the desk, it would be better to book by phone rather than on the internet, because it would allow for a better cancellation policy if needed. I thought that was a little odd, but that is what we did.",comocove
50,Fun Trip!,Beautiful ride across the channel and great experience. The employees are very friendly and helpful making sure everyone on board is safe and secure.

30,Recommended but...,"As an OC local I understand there are basically two ways to get to Catalina Island. One of the boats (Newport, Long Beach, LA), or helicopter.I have been riding the Flyer/Express since I was a kid. Recently I attended an event on the Long Beach Express and was not impressed with it’s upkeep. The Boat was messy, the carpet was trashed, the edges of the carpet were dirty, food, crumbs, super nasty. Some of the seats were falling into the storage boxes under them which were full of old dirty debris. Sadly the boats are the only way to really get to Catalina for people, understandably they get used a lot... but the bot was not up kept.",Following JoJo
30,Quick ride to the Island,"I say average based on no other similar experiences, but it was one of only two services to Catalina Island, and it was where we wanted to go. We waited in line early both ways to get on board, but not really necessary, unless you really wanted a window seat. 6:00 p.m. return trip was full of tired babies who made the trip a little challenging. I'd like to spend more time exploring the island someday.",LovesTheWest
40,Quick Ride to Catalina Island,"We took the 9AM ride from San Pedro to Avalon, with the return ride at 5PM. The ""cruise"" takes about 75 minutes, dropping you off at the dock about 2 blocks from main street Avalon. The boat appears to seat about 150 people, with two decks. Snacks and drinks are available on board, and there is food and drink available in the terminal at San Pedro. Parking is plentiful for $18 per day. The ride was smooth and uneventful except for a brief sighting of several dolphins.",bverbos

The ferry runs on time and was super efficient getting on and off.",AlanBoxer
40,Fun excursion to Catalina Island,"If you’re looking for something fun to do in the Los Angeles area, I highly recommend taking a boat over to Catalina Island. The Catalina Express is one of a couple of commercial boat services that will take you to the island. It is fast (roughly an hour from Long Beach) and fun. You can either sit inside or outside and enjoy the view from either location. If you buy a special ticket in the “commodore lounge” for an additional cost, you get private access to the top enclosed seating area on the boat and get a snack and alcoholic beverage with this purchase. The commodore lounge is also nice because you get to board the boat (bypass lines) before every other general passenger. The trip was comfortable and felt more luxurious than a standard ferry ride, and I thought the extra price for the commodore lounge was worth it. There are multiple times throughout the day that you can depart and for a $5 fee you can change your departure time as long as there’s room on the boat. I only went for a day trip but I would love to stay over night or for a weekend.",Kari_Lutcavich
50,Easy Breezy cruise to Catalina,"We actually think it is easier to drive to Long Beach (or uber) instead of taking the Newport Flyer from our home base in the OC. The Catalina Express is fast, has an upgraded VIP lounge, and with a drink included. We travel to Catalina all the time so take my advice HAVE THE SPICY BLOODY MARY and you will feel no sea sickness! It knocks your equilibrium off just enough to balance your senses. The staff is in full uniform and they are very friendly and professional.

50,"An Easy, Comfortable Ride to Catalina","We loved the Catalina Express ferry; we booked our reservations ahead since they can sell out. There's a parking garage where you can leave your car; we had to drive around for a while to find open parking so allow time for that. The terminal itself is pretty nice; they have seating and also food and drink available for purchase if you want it. About half an hour before our departure time, they asked everyone to line up outside. There was no security or bag check-in; you just carry your bags yourself and drop them off once you get inside the boat. The seating is comfortable, not assigned so get in line early if you want first pick. You can upgrade to the Commodore Lounge for an extra fee when you buy your ticket and get a complimentary drink and snack; people that pay the extra $15 get to board first. We didn't pay for the upgrade and were fine with the seating we got. They had drinks you could buy, including their famous Bloody Marys. Our ride was smooth and took about an hour; we saw dolphins along the way which was a nice bonus. If you're looking for a comfortable, affordable way to get from Long Beach to Catalina, the Catalina Express is the perfect way to go. We would definitely use it again the next time we go to the island.",volcanogirl

40,Joe G.,"Our group took a day trip to Catalina and used the Express for our round trip transportation. We paid extra for the extra comfort of the Commodor's Lounge and were very happy with the trip to the island. Crewmembers were friendly and attentive. Unfortunately, things were quite different on the return trip. I can only guess that the staff was tired after a long day.",Joe G
50,KB,"We had a group of 70 plus consisting of high school football team, cheerleaders, volleyball team and parents. Staff was mostly helpful and friendly. Much better than slower boats that can take 2 plus hours. We were in Avalon in an hour. Clean boats with snack bar.",Kyle B
50,Beautiful way to get to the island!,We enjoyed the ride to the island and back for our day trip.Tried booking online in the morning and it would not allow me to book for the same morning. I called and was able to reserve over the phone.Onboard staff was friendly for the most part. There were a couple younger employees that did a great job of looking like they would rather be anywhere but on the boat.The ride was fast and smooth.The Commodore pass is kind of a waste in my opinion (we booked that coming back). You can buy drinks on the boat which was nice.Would definitely ride again.,Jim B
30,Good experience,"We had two round trips to Catalina Island on the Express this summer. The experiences were good as the boat was clean and comfortable. I am disappointed with the cost differential to use the commodore lounge. A small bag of snacks and a beverage, and boarding first are small benefits. Not worth it for a family. I was most disappointed to have to pay to return on an earlier ship even when it was only half full.",Dave V
50,Smooth Trip,"Took the family to Catalina Island. The trip was smooth with plenty of bath rooms, indoor and outdoor seating, and refreshments available.",Kyle V
40,Fast and painless,"When traveling to Catalina Island, this is the only only way to travel. It's fast and painless at about an hour. Otherwise, you'll have to deal with 3 hours of potential seasickness and waste of time. There are plenty of seating inside and outside. There is also a snack bar for food and drinks.",jt99941
50,Wonderful Ferry,"Decided to go to Catalina and my husband spoke to a real person for reservations. She was very helpful and got us into the Commadore Club for the next day. Beautiful ferry ride. Comfortable trip. Catalina Island was outstanding! We took a bus tour, ate lunch out, and just walked around. We would consider flying to the West Coast just to stay on Catalina for a week!",Jean S
50,"Overall, excellent! A hitch in the return trip!","We visited Catalina Island for the 4th time on July 26, using Catalina Express for all four visits. The trip out was awesome -- comfortable, smooth and the scenery beautiful! The trip back that evening must have been overbooked -- though it was a smoothride and the view was beautiful, there were more people than seats! Two of my family members had to stand or sit on the floor of the boat. This is unacceptable given the cost of the trip. This is the only issue we have ever had.",susanhG3047CZ
50,Convenient,Catalina Express is a convenient way to travel to and from Catalina Island. We took Catalina Express from Long Beach. They have different ports to go to Catalina Island. Its so convenient drive your car to the port park it just infrobt kf where they are docked. And just wait for your boat that will bring you to Catalina Island.,Michael D

40,Day Trip,"My family, which includes 4 teenagers, found the ferry to be accommodating. We took general boarding over and private area on the way home. There were benefits to private area, however if you are on a budget, regular seating is just fine for this hour long ride. Plenty of parking at launch site and easy to find.",JQ71
40,Avalon,I love catalina and the catalina express service to the island is very helpful.They were able to change my trips going to and coming from the island. No hassle...,Allyson E
50,Smooth sailing,We had an awesome time on the ferry! It was an hour ride from the port of Long Beach to Catalina Island (Avalon). We didn’t know what to expect since it was our first time on this ferry but we were pleased how everything went. We boarded the Catalina Express Jet and it was a smooth ride all the way; no one got sick. Staff were helpful and the ferry was right on scheduled. Thank you for a wonderful experience Catalina Express!,kpan68
40,"Set Sail For A Great Time, Save Money And No Sea Sickness.","Catalina Express has evolved into a well run operation and you won't regret taking the trip so now lets make it more enjoyable. If you are a senior then get your senior discount ticket, if you're not a senior then use Triple A (You must print out the coupon to take to the reservations desk to get your discount) or look online for coupons. You will save about $7.50 a ticket which is better in your pocket than theirs.Arrive early. You can park literally across the street ($19) and then you need to check in. Miss your check in time and you will miss the boat which puts you on standby for the next boat but no guarantees. The departure lounge is clean the drinks are good and the food is not overpriced. If you've kids or first time sailors no fizzy drinks and have them eat sparingly. The boat ride itself is smooth, the journey is only an hour but the sea will do what it wants to do. If you were on time, then line up fifteen minutes earlier than they say as this will afford you a better choice of seat.General seating on the base level, Commordore seating (You can get a $15 upgrade) on the midlevel and more general seating on the top level although on that level you it is open air. Skip the commordore level especially with first time sailors. The higher up the boat you go the more ""roll"" you will experience at sea. I like the top level but on the way back when it's cooler and you're tired you'll want that lower level which is enclosed.The boats are clean the staff are ok. Some good ones and some who just haven't been trained properly. Basic lesson one. Smile and welcome people aboard. People are going to enjoy themselves on Catalina so welcome people aboard be helpful in helping people get seated and luggage stowed. Last but not least if you have any sense you will be seasick such on a real Ginger lozenge. I think you are going to be fine and Catalina is definitely worth the trip. Have fun :-)",Michael S
50,Great 1 hour ride to a mini Cabo San Lucas.,"Clean, plenty of space, comfortable seats, bar, whats not to like. Catalina is a great place to visit. If you can afford a nicer hotel, do it. We split the stay between cheaper place and a more expensive place. 149 vs 299. The cheaper place was just not worth the savings.",54Traveler2014
50,Great ride to Catalina Island,"Smooth and fast way to travel to Catalina Island. Make sure to reserve round trip in advance, they sell out. The VIP option is nice especially if you want to sit inside. We purchased the general ticket but got in line early so we could get a good seat on the outside. The views were wonderful. The ferry has snacks and beverages for purchase. On the way back we sat inside but against a wall where there was a power outlet to charge a phone. The Catalina Express is apart of the Catalina Island experience. We enjoyed the trip and the staff was friendly.",Percy ly M
50,Fun Day Trimp,We took our family to Avalon for the day. None of us had ever been there or even on a ferry before. We all had a great time. The crew was friendly and helpful. The ferry from San Pedro to Avalon is about 1.25 hours. Parking costs $10-$18 depending on how long you are there.,Kelly B
40,Good way to get to Catalina island,"Pros: clean boat, waiting lounge is large and has a restaurant and bar, the boat has a bar with snacks, friendly on board staffCons: if you get sea sick, don't go to Catalina island this way, use the helicopter option. We took the last boat out and it was small. It was like riding a wild roller coaster. Several people got sea sick. Its about an hour each way. The check in staff were impatient and clearly in need of a break.",Julia G
40,Fun day trip,"My wife and I opted to take the admiral's lounge, it wad pleasant however there mirrors inside are a bit distracting and disorienting. If you are prone to seasickness, I would not recommend this part of the boat, you might be better suited above. The island itself was great, very interesting and I highly recommend the zipline tour.",Brian L
40,Your only choice for two harbors,"Only ferry to two Harbors. Local COSTCOs sell 20% discount cards. Senior discount starts at 55. Crew is friendly. Quick trip, no time to get seasick! If you are freaky about riding a boat though, hang in the back, near the center. The smoothest part.",krykie
50,Just like flying only more comfy!,"This was our first time visiting Catalina and I had no idea that you had to have a reservation to get on the ferry. I am so happy that my daughter bugged me to call a day before only to be told that the earliest departure was for 2PM (we were trying to catch the 10AM). So no choice we took the 2PM departure and I was told that we had to be there an hour before and that you are able to check in 2 pieces of luggage at 50 pounds each. Just like flying.Parking was easy but was expensive - $19 all day. It was a very big ferry. We took coach going to the island and upgraded to the Commodore Lounge on the way back for $15. Regular fair for coach is $73.50RT.Just like a plane, they demonstrated where the find the life jackets (under your seat) and how to put them on. They had a bar on each floor and sold different types of snacks. $2.25 for a bag of chips and $1 for a chocolate bar. At the Commodore Lounge you get a drink an a cookie.The trip was comfy but you do still feel the rocking of the ferry - made me a bit queasy but being on the Commodore Lounge was more comfy as you did not feel it as much.",Fiona H
50,Nice trip!,Boat was nice and staff were great. But recommend upgrading to the commodore lounge at least one way if not both!,Tena B
50,beautiful dat at Catalina Island,"The boat ride was quick. The workers on the ship were nice and helpful. Catalina was crowed but this is the middle of summer. Nice shops and good eating places. If you want to go to the beach, get there early.",V8593DCkareno
40,Travel with passion,Now going on the ferry was a excellent idea! Well that is really only way to get the Island except with a helicopter.The staff was so friendly !We did the VIP on the way back and it’s worth the extra $15 dollars,trustitl
30,Same day trip,We sat in the Commodores section upstairs which is completely covered. Seats were fairly comfortable the area was fairly clean. Not much in the way of snacks - either chocolate chip cookies or spicy pretzel mix. They run on time and it takes an hour to get from one point to the other. It’s slow-moving and smooth. it was hot on the way back with the sun shining full strength through the windows. We should have sat on the other side but there weren’t any seats left. There is nothing to see and it is boring.,Kabear
40,Took a day trip to Catalina Island,"Great service. Quick, clean cabin area. We opted to upgrade to the top deck - well worth it. You get seat drink service and it made it a more enjoyable trip",My3kidsmd

50,The day was great!,"Catalina Island is a must-visit. By far the best part of my Southern California trip. The Catalina Express was a great ferry ride. There was a cafe at the station in Long Beach that was a bit overpriced, but besides that, everything was great!",higoomgala
50,Great ride; Upgrade to Commodore Lounge,"We took a day trip to Catalina Island and had great rides on the Catalina Express. It’s clean and comfortable, and the ride is relaxing (keep your eyes peeled for seals near each port!). At $15/pp, upgrading for an included cocktail and waiter service is recommended! It really made the trip special. You also get to board first, which my teens thought was awesome.",laurak022
50,Excellent Ferry Ride,The Catalina Express ferry is a relaxing way to get to Catalina Island. I fell asleep on the way to the island and then we sat on the second level on the way back from the island so we could enjoy the sea breeze. Smooth sailing and clean surfaces made for a quick relaxing trip.,jasonfree350

30,Catalina Express,"I go for the free birthday ride on my birthdays. Would have rated them excellent, however last year it was required for you to also bring along someone else. I was running late so I called in to change my departure time. That was ok however upon my returning to the main land I have requested an upgrade and did not notice that was cancelled when I had changed by departure time. So make sure you do pay attention to the times and seating request on your tickets. Catalina Express will try to sell you tour packages but they will cost more than the ones you can purchase on the island. But during the week most of the tours are not open like they are on the weekends so we were not able to go the the other side of the island to Two Habors and to take the grand island tour. But we rented golf carts for two hours. That was alot of fun. I did not get a chance to drive because my daughter did all the driving and I got a chance to take lots of pictures. It was really fun. Looking forward to going this summer again.",slfs747

50,Fast amazing boat and crew,"Had booked the 11am ferry but was able to get on stand-by for the 9:50am ferry thanks to the amazing customer service at the ticket counter. On way back from Catalina we upgraded to the Commodore Lounge and it was amazing! Priority boarding, free drink and plenty of space to stretch out. I would highly recommend!",JRG_75
50,We did the upgraded seats on the way there,"Why is this trip so expensive? I have no idea. But Catalina is a must-see, a cute island with shops and restaurants. The color of the water is a deep blue. Lovely. We had the upgraded seats on the way there, which included a drink and a snack. Champagne, yes please! Highly recommended. On the way back we had the regular seats, which were fine. We were practically asleep. So go big on the way there and with the general population on the way back since you will be beat from kayaking, walking, eating, drinking, shopping, swimming!",travelingrules
40,Fun Adventure to Catalina Island - Boat Was Late on Return Trip Though,"I was very impressed with the Catalina Express ferry to Catalina Island. The interior has some nice seats and some areas have tables. The restrooms and snack bar are centrally located on the bottom level. I had general seating, so I'm sure the upper levels were even nicer.My only complaint is the ferry was late on the way back to Long Beach and everyone had to stand in line for longer than expected. Hopefully more seating can be added to the dock at Catalina Island at some point in case this happens again.All in all a fun experience that is worth the price.",jmtphx
50,We took the Catalina Express route from Dana Pt. To Catalina Is.,Everything about the service is very good but make sure to make a reservation. We were first and second on the waiting list so got on. Seats are comfortable and it takes about 1.5 hours. The day we went the water was not all that calm but I didn’t notice any seasick people. They offer cocktails for purchase on board..FYI.,BunnieinOregon
50,Perfect Catalina weekend,"Wow! I found out our Captains name was Troy. On the trip over, we came upon an enormous pod of dolphins. Captain Troy slowed the boat down, announced the pod was out there and allowed the bow opened for viewers and did a ""donut"" so that everyone could see the dolphins play. Marie made the best Bloody Mary's and Steve is the best deckhand. What a great experience!",sclarebeck

50,Quick ride,"We flew into the long beach airport, then we caught a cab yo get to the ferry. It was a very long line, so if you are going mid day, make sure you get there early. You can pay a premium, but the regular seats are just fine. It was a bit windy going, but coming back it was a very smooth ride. I don't like boats, so I took dramamine, drank a ginger drink and ate ginger candy they sell. Overall, it was a great experience and took about an hour each way. The people on the boat were very helpful and took good care of our luggage.",T G

50,Long Beach to Catalina Island,"You do have to get there early and wait in line, but the staff were professional and happily answered questions and the boat was clean.

We will definitely use them again in the future.",Karen G

50,Delightful excursion,"We won a two night stay in Catalina & this was the closest ferry to take to get to Catalina. After reading reviews we opted for the Commodore Lounge which is $15 extra per person per way but is worth it. You get a snack, cookies, chips, etc + one cocktail. The best part is the preboarding & being able to choose a comfy seat in the lounge. The crew is on point, loading & unloading people with luggage on & off efficiently. The ride was smooth & the cocktail waitress was extremely personable & pleasant. I highly recommend the Catalina Express.BTW, the parking is located in covered & uncovered parking in the building across from the Catalina Express departure. There's a $17.00 charge for parking per day. There are two places to eat, one is a sit down with a bar & the other is a take away casual snack kitchen. There is one kitchen that serves both, but the sit down has better menu choices. Allow some time for that if you are hungry. Great wedge salad.",Lexibelle
50,Day trip,"Took some out of town guests to Catalina for the day. The Commodore lounge is the way to go. Great view from higher up, and you get a free beverage and small snack. Service in the Lounge was friendly and prompt. Only negative comment was that the windows were not clear. It was not that they looked dirty, they looked old and in need of replacement. This made for some difficult viewing, especially when the sun was shining directly in the window.",jphl63

Seats are first come, first served so get there early and pick carefully. We took the 11am over and returned on 6:30pm. This was exactly enough time to take the golf cart tour, walk around a bit and grab something to eat before getting back on the boat. Also, first class boards first and since it was cold and windy we def appreciated being able to board early and get out of the cold.",stephaniesK6902UK

50,Smooth Sailing....,The boats are in top condition--clean and comfortable. The catamaran style boat makes for the smoothest and most comfortable ride to the island. Food service is fast and simple. We had seats outside in the back and we were able to enjoy watching dolphins jump in the boat's wake for several minutes of the ride!,CarolMB1971
50,Beautiful,I love Catalina Island. It is just lovely.We rented golf carts to explore the island.Wrigley Monument and botanical garden is a must see. We spent the whole afternoon there. The restraunts are tasty and the private beach is the place to be.I'll be visiting again.,Suzanne
50,Nice day trip to Catalina Island,Took an 9:00am boat trip to Catalina Island. Good location to pick up boat. Returned later that day. Was a very enjoyable trip.,Rudolph2
40,Birthday Trip,I gave a four star because when we left out of Long Beach we were not offered an upgrade on our ticket. I wish they would have offered it. I think it’s worth it because you get priority boarding as well as a different seating area with drinks and snacks. Other than that the ride was smooth the seating is fine and there is luggage storage as well as over head bins. Plenty of space. If you want to sit on top you’ll need to be first boarders otherwise it fills up.,Nicole M
50,Absolutely Awesome!,"Had never been to Catalina Island, so we decided to take a trip out there. I'm SO GLAD that we did! Take the opportunity and get the upgrade. It's so worth it - great snack to watch as you sail. Be advised, parking isn't included in your ticket cost. Bring a jacket, as it can be chilly. Still, great time to be had by all!",Hannahbears_mom
40,Definitely Worth the Upgrade,"All in all, the Catalina Express was a pretty decent experience. First, as a small heads up, parking (while it is adjacent to the building, and super convenient) is not included in the price of the ship. Might come in handy to have $17 cash on your for that. A small price for all day parking.We got to the terminal nice and early. There are some touristic pamphlets for you to read, and a small cafe to grab breakfast on. If you purchase a gift card from Catalina Express, you can only use it for the fare on the ship, and in the terminal. Not for food/drink purchases on the ships, just a FYI.Once on the ship, we did just a general seating for the way there. I get sea sick, easily. Other than a little vertigo though, it's smooth sailing once you pass by the Queen Mary and you enter a vast, open ocean. Take heed, it was incredibly windy! There is seating indoors, if you want it, but I wanted to enjoy the ocean view on the ride over.On the way back, we upgraded to the Commodore lounge, and it's highly worth it. The ocean isn't as gorgeous late at night, and it would be too cold for me to sit outside and try to wave watch anyway. You sit indoors, and an alcoholic drink plus a snack is included (Famous Amos cookies, or a 'spicy' trail mix). I know everyone raves about the Bloody Mary, but it just wasn't for me. The Mai Tai was a bit better, but definitely on the sweet side.Indoors, you have acess to a small TV, private seating, and definitely much warmed than the cold air.All in all, worth the price of the trip. Definitely will be back on board sometime soon.",Davina D

There is a small coffee shop in board and be sure and get upstairs to view the trip.There are available outlets to charge your devices if necessary. Seating is comfortable. We booked our tickets through Hotel Catalina as that was the most economical way. Note there are no lockers at the terminal to store your luggage if you want to explore Long Beach before or after your trip.,Ken B
50,Pleasant ferry trip,"My wife and I took the Catalina Express form Long Beach to Avalon, returning to Dana Point the following day. We upgraded to Commodore Lounge on the trip out, which was worthwhile. The sunset on the return was spectacular.",mjh672016
50,Great Boat Ride,"We took the Catalina Express over to the Island for an over night stay and upgraded to the Commodore Lounge, it was totally worth the $15. We received a complimentary beverage a snack, a great view and were able to board the boat first! The seating in the lounge is very comfortable with tables in a few locations. I highly recommend this upgrade.",Ryder’sleash
50,The captain slowed for us to watch the whales.,"The crew were very polite and we enjoyed this fast trip to Avalon. Aside from the whale sighting, there were also dolphins. Although we were on one of the smaller boats, it was very comfy - the almost glassy sea had a lot to do with that I guess. I guess the only complaint is that the location was a bit difficult to find. However, there was plenty of free parking. In this case, due to the demand, the company added a boat that was not scheduled, otherwise we would have missed the opportunity to visit Avalon.",Tom S

50,A great way to get to Catalina and back!,"After meetings throughout the morning and early afternoon, we had several hours. It was decided that our group would take the Catalina Express to the island and back. It was a great experience. The crew was superior, offering us Nemo's cookies and a spicy Asian mix along with a drink.The water only had one to three foot swells, so none of us had any problems with seasickness. It was great. The trip to beautiful Catalina is well with it. I'd go back again in a heartbeat!",Eurotraveler110

40,Go when the weather is good,"This is a fun trip. Very scenic. Once you arrive, then the fun begins. Make sure you bring enough spending money. Things can get pretty expensive. Oh, also, on your way there, you may want to bring some Dramamine for motion-sickness ('seasickness'). Don't forget to eat a little something because, surprisingly, having something on your stomach helps with seasickness. The island is rather small, so, while you can have fun, there's only so much you can do. If you mingle with the buffalo (bison), be sure to follow the guides directions. These animals look slow, but can easily outrun you! So, be careful. It can be a bit dangerous. (Don't be too disappointed if you find that these are not 100% buffalo as visitors had been told over the years!) If you'd like, you can even stay a few nights at one of the hotels. It's a nice honeymoon spot. Bottom line, It's well worth the trip, especially if the weather is good.",Firpo C
50,The Great Escape,"Catalina Island is a beautiful place. It’s like a mini mediterranean. Reminds me of Monaco some how with it’s cove and marina filled with boats and its half moon bay and tall mountain behind it. Picture perfect for celebrating a big achievement or accomplishment. It’s got the longest zipline from mountain to shore. I think about 2+ miles. Can be a nice local honeymoon spot. It has several activities such as scuba diving, submarine tour, an air museum, island tour to name a few. It’s a must see destination for sure.",GusTonsay
40,Good service,We dint take the upgraded seats but the general ones. The view is beautiful at the deck. Crew is hospitable and courteous. Note that if you have booked a slot for a particular time it will cost 5USD to change it to other time slot. So make sure when you would want to take the to & fro journey. Overall a very good experience.,deecee1987

40,Pay for parking,"The ride to Catalina was very relaxing and enjoyable. The crew on the boat was awesome. My ONLY complaint was the parking. All of the signs tell you that parking for the cruise is in the parking garage. What they don’t tell you ahead of time is that parking for a day trip cost $17 dollars. They don’t validate!!! My suggestion is that you don’t park in the designated garage but look for cheaper or free parking. With the cost of the cruise, I believe that parking should be included!!",QtTracy

50,Quick and efficient means of travel,"We took the Catalina Express ferry round trip from Long Beach, CA over to Catalina Island. They operate double hull catamarans that glide over the water in just over an hour. The ticketing was fast and simple in person, did not purchase ahead of time as we did not know which ferry we would catch. Seating was comfortable, bathrooms clean and they offered a variety of snacks and drinks. They offer a senior discount but no round trip discount.",allisond660
50,boat trip to catalina,"the whole trip was good , but Catalina is way over priced . and we got there at 2:30 pm and most of the stuff to do was closing down . very early , wanted go on the glass bottom boat and it was too late. But, I will say all the people were very pleasant",laura s
40,BEST way to get to Catalina Island! Only way too unless you have your own boat or a helicopter!,"I have used Catalina Express for YEARS. Even though it seems expensive it really is your best bet to get to Catalina Island.It can get rough crossing from Long Beach to Catalina so if you get sea sick try and book the earliest boat available. Crossing early in the morning is much smoother and not as rocky. If you cross in the afternoon or at night, watch out! It gets rough and a lot of people will get sea sick.Wear sensible shoes on board, the floor can get wet and there are stairs onboard. Athletic shoes are best and no heels! I’ve seen woman slip and fall too many times.This is such a fun ride with kids. It’s very windy and can get chilly so always wear a jacket. Some of the ships are newer than others and some are faster than others. When you call to book ask about which boat is fastest.Highly recommend - this is a must do and Catalina Island a must see during the summer in California!",Tatabooboobax
50,The only way to go!,"Catalina Express does one thing and they do it well! I use this service every time I go back and forth to Catalina and I wouldn't use any other company. The boats are well-kept and have so many seat options (inside, outside, front-facing, rear-facing). They also have bars on each of the boats where you can buy snacks and drinks, including alcohol. Although the ride is just over one hour, it is nice to know you can grab a bite or s drink on the way. The boats can get pretty full so if you're worried about where you might find a seat then I'd suggest getting to the port early so you can stand in the front of the line. Otherwise, it's pretty simple and the staff makes sure you are taken care of and safe.",Lisa G
50,SMOOTH SAILING!,"The Catalina Express is an easy way to travel to Catalina. We rode over on the regular passage and sat outside to enjoy the fresh air and scenery. On the return, we were able to score Commodore Lounge tickets for $15 more per person. You can enjoy the ride completely without the upgrade, but it is a bit quieter, comfier, and you get a drink and snack along with early boarding and no line. This trip is a little over an hour, so it may not be worth the upgrade to everyone. A drink and snack are probably $10, so upgrade for options if you plan to get a drink and snack or hate standing in lines. It was nice on the way home to relax a little in the lounge. My husband and teenage son loved the upgrade, but I loved it both ways!",NicoleHinCA
50,Getaway,"Great trip, very smooth ride. It is windy and can be cold if you sit outside. When you get to Catalina it is close enough to walk everywhere.",ekellys
50,Birthday rides,Free birthday rides are so fun. Don’t take it away from us! They give you a button to wear so everyone all over the island knows it’s your birthday.,Dawnielle & Mar... M
50,Modern Fast and comfortable boats to Catalina,"Comfortable short ride and while not inexpensive it is a bargain compared to the other means of transport to the Island; helicopter, private plane or private boat. We chose to pay the extra $15 to sit in the Commodore lounge which provides for early boarding and a shorter line plus a complimentary drink which can be alcohol to include mixed drinks and wine plus a snack. If you take this option try to get to the two most front row seats on either side of the cabin for the best view and privacy. They also offer a private cabin for 4 to 6 people with drinks that is priced perfectly with the Commodore lounge on selected sailings",6sandy6
40,The Captains Lounge is worth the extra money,"The Catalina Express is really the only way to get to Catalina Island if you don't have access to a private boat and can't afford a helicopter trip, but, even with their having a corner on the market, they do their best to make your journey pleasant. The regular seating is a lot like airplane seating, though, so if you need or want more space the upgrade to the Captains Lounge is totally worth the extra money. The seating is more like that of a lounge, with tables, a complimentary non-alcoholic beverage and a bar that offers alcohol and snacks. We usually get the upgrade for the journey home, when our feet are tired and we want to relax.",astorin
50,Catalina Express,We have been using Catalina Express ever since I remember.It's a no-brainer to use them to head to Catalina Island.,yvettescorvette
50,"The only way to go, and it's a good one!","Did a mother-daughter trip to Catalina, and we took the super early, before the sunrise ferry over to the island. Halfway through the journey, we had complete nighttime on one side of the boat, and daylight on the other. It was beautiful. Even saw dolphins leaping out of the water as we approached the shore. The seating is comfortable enough, plenty of room and nice storage for bags. Make sure you check the limitations online before packing for your trip! On our return ferry, we were able to easily change our departure time and upgrade to the Commodore Lounge (slightly nicer seating up top and a free drink) for a small fee. The bloody Mary tasted good on the way back, let me tell ya. :) I don't know what the ferry is like during peak tourist times, but our trip back and forth was comfy as easy. Parking at the Long Beach office was a breeze. $17 daily max per 24 hr period. Overnight parking okay and no parking reservations necessary. Accepted methods of payment are cash, Visa or Mastercard.",JoleneOKay
40,Comfortable Trip to Catalina From Long Beach,The one hour trip from Long to Avalon was very pleasant....seats comfortable. Parking is easy. Small snack bar on board. Passenger area was clean.,Love vacation time
50,Nice smooth ride to the island,"The trip was just over an hour and very comfortable. We were in the general seating and there was plenty of room. I wish i would have known that the island starts shutting down at 5, we would have come back on an earlier boat.",Rick C
10,Staff Indifference,"I'm pretty certain the staff takes a particular, almost sadistic pleasure in inconveniencing patrons. While the examples are many, first was the ""line up"" to board. On what had to be close to record heat in October we were all called to line up for boarding 30 minutes before departure, in the direct sun. We stood around and baked for 25 minutes before boarding actually began. We easily could have remained inside until the actual boarding. While on the ferry a crew member makes a half-hearted attempt at explaining the safety procedure including the use of life vests. Unless you're in the first two rows nothing can be heard. A real problem onboard would be catastrophic. The boarding fiasco was repeated upon our return, where again everyone was told to line up in the scorching sun, only to begin actual boarding 10 minutes AFTER our scheduled departure. The final insult was when, upon departure and non-existent directions on the procedure, I got my bag but wasn't allowed to go back on the board to collect my other belongings. I had to re-board at ferry and wait 20 minutes - again - to finally get off the boat. Weak.",Norcalcan
50,Good experience.,We took the express to Catalina and sat in the Commodore lounge. It was fine. They give drink tickets for there and back. The seats were comfortable but the snacks were limited . The ride itself take about an hour from Long Beach.,erRN4
50,Smooth ride to the island!,"The waiting area at the dock was very comfortable. Everything was on time, that was a plus. The trip over to Catalina Island was pretty smooth. We were in general seating and was very comfortable. They time flew by. Prior to the trip making the reservations was perfect. The reservationist were very professional, polite and informative.",jkurtz1972
30,Good trip to Catalina,"Took the Catalina Express from Long Beach. The boat trip itself over to the island is good, enjoyed the views, we had a window seat. They ask you to be there 1 hour before the boat leaves. I was told when I checked in they would start boarding at 10:20, boat would leave at 10:50. They were late boarding (20-30 minutes after the time they said) and late leaving for both initial and return trips. The line to board the boat was very long and we stood and waited for a very long time before being able to board. We went on a Sunday and Monday in October. They were having a music festival this weekend on Catalina Island, so we may have just picked an extra busy time to go.",Rebecca H
30,Excellent ride to the island,The Catalina Express offers a great way to take the crossing from Long Beach to Catalina Island. It is a fun trip and you will often see dolphins on the way.,buffalojim67

40,Fun in the sun,"Making reservations were simple, prices affordable and boarding quick and easy. The staff was friendly. We enjoyed the trip across the water. But get there early to get a good seat (really there are no bad seats). Inside seats fill up quickly. Dress warm if sitting outside.",aaronap7
50,Birthday special really is special!,"If you can take advantage of the ""birthday special"" you should - birthday person travels free with one other on the Catalina Express and there are many discounts at stores and restaurants on the island. Our hotel even supplied us with complimentary wine. The ferry ride alone is worth it!",NSmer
50,Nice trip-upgrade to commodore lounge,"Great ride over to Avalon. We upgraded for early boarding and snacks. Was worth it. Daughter got queasy, so if you get motion sick take something. Loved it.",AnnmarieK

40,Ferry Long Beach to/from Avalon,Took the ferry in peak season in August but had no issues getting a ticket when I wanted to ride. The trip is about an hour and was nice and smooth. You can sit inside or out and the staff will help you with your luggage. Everything seemed well organized and the trip each way was very pleasant. Changing a ticket is allowed with a small fee. The boats dock near the center of town and the shuttles stop here regularly.,zippy1717
50,Excellent experience leading to beautiful Catalina Island,"We bought the discount card at Costco, which saved us $20. The boat was clean, comfortable, and the ride was smooth.

50,Pay the extra money and ride in the Commodore Lounge,"Great seats, food and a drink and air conditioned room. The best place way to start your trip is with a bloody mary drink with friends. You will get plenty of sun and fun once you get to the island so enjoy the Commodore Lounge going and coming back.",Lee W
40,Get in Line Early,Going over at 8:50 am on a Friday was not bad so finding seat was easy. Return trip st 6:15 pm was a bit more crowded but did get a seat inside. Bring a jacket if you come back in evening as can get cold if outside.Water a little rough but overall the ride was good and the boat left and arrived as scheduled.,Turnkey56
50,A Terrific Ferry Experience!,"A friend and I drove down to Long Beach from Los Angeles and caught the Catalina Express to Avalon. We elected to pay the extra and experience the Commodore Lounge instead of going with general admission. The lounge is comfortable and provides all with a scenic view as the ferry makes it way to and from Avalon. A free drink and snack is also available to all passengers in the lounge. The staff is very friendly and helpful throughout the excursion. Parking is conveniently located across the street from the pier, and the daily rate was $17. We thoroughly enjoyed this experience!",apatejr
40,Good Experience,"We took the six am ferry to Catalina island and it was perfect. We got to see the sun rise on the ocean. Perfect. Our ride back was nice too, more crowded and there were screaming kids on board but it was still a good experience. A little to expensive though, if you ask me.",Stacey H
50,Great Relaxing cruise,Travelled to Avalon on this relaxing boat ride. There are several seating options. Regular admission seating on upper deck or inside with bar Or for $15 each way additional you can stay in a more private seating area the Commodore with bar.There is also thCaptains seating for $60 each way also private and comes with drinks. It is a lovely ride and well worth doing,Rockdoc7
50,Hubby's bday,"Catalina is a very quaint town. We had a very relaxing time, far from traffic and work. Will definitely go again next time!",HelenNae
30,Slow boat to Catalina,"Not that many choices, and they were running a discount, so that's good. But the seating was uncomfortable, the snack bar had only a few items, and the cabin was smelly. I prefer to be up above, but it was too crowded, so we got stick downstairs. Definitely take motion sickness pills - it is a bumpy ride, and the cabin got pretty stuffy.",TravelersHigh77
50,Excellent trip,"We traveled from Long Beach to Avalon during the Labor Day weekend. The ~1 hour trip was very comfortable, lots of seating options on the ferry - upstairs or downstairs, and also outside on the upper deck. The entire experience - from online reservations to check-in at the terminal, boarding and unboarding - was extremely efficient and well organized. Highly recommended. Parking in the garage was simple and actually quite reasonable ($17 per day).",Rajan M
50,Reall great ride!,"Very nice trip to and from the island. We did an upgrade on the return and it was worth the extra bucks. Catalina tends to be a bit expensive...but then again, any island is! Happy to go on Catalina Express. Thanks",Potluck1949
40,Nice trip!,Took this to Catalina to spend a few hours. It's a bit expensive but everything in this area is. It's a nice ride.,ripley304
40,Two money saving tips,"Fine fast ride.Two tips:1. When you buy your tickets on line you are asked to print them out. When you bring the print out to the terminal (eg, in long beach), you can, depending on availability switch your tickets around. What they don't tell you in Long Beach is that after tickets are issues it costs $5 every time you change your ticket. My advice: Get the outbound tickets on the outbound, and hold on to your printed piece of paper for the return tickets. This way you can cash in the return ticket in Avalon and change it for an earlier/later departure without paying this extra fee.2. If you queue up early enough before departure you will be in the nice space downstairs - no need to pay extra for the same space a floor above (Commodore lounge). Note that queuing is outside at the mercy of the elements.",Trip A
50,Great deal,But one night is enough! We stayed 4 nights and we were bored. Best part was the boat ride to and from the island.,steveluxenberg
40,commodore lounge is awesome,"We upgraded to the commodore lounge and were not disappointed, The staff were awesome. We were treated to a free drink and Famous Amos Cookies. Very comfortable ride over. I would give them 5 stars however, my husband said that the bathroom toilet had urine all over the seat and around the rim under the seat. There was also no paper for the seat for the women. It is only 65 minutes so go before you leave!!!!",Cheryl S
50,To the Catalina Island,"Strange but true. Unfortunately I have lost it but I build it on trust. Sometimes you need to use your imagination and, as Leopardi, you study all about a different place and use your mind to be there. So o left the harbor with my Queen Mary and I get there together with Catalina Express. I was with QM Phantom while I saw people so funny there I wished to be there. Then the Islan showed off in all it's beauty.",Gian Luca V
50,Beautiful Ride,Took the 9:00 AM out to Catalina and the scenery was beautiful. We even saw a pod of dolphins!! The 70 minute ride was calm and refreshing! I chose to sit outside on the second deck where the engine noise was prominent but you could choose to be inside where it was quieter.,Nadene R
50,Birthday Trip to Catalina,"We took advantage of the Free ride on your EXACT birthday trip to Avalon. You can sign up online and you show your ID to get the free ticket to Avalon. You need another passenger to pay FULL price(no senior discount allowed). You park in the open parking lot behind the cruise parking lot. You then walk over to Catalina Express to pick up your tickets. There is waiting room inside with restrooms and a small cafe for food. You can pay for the Commodore level $16 to get a drink and snack and priority boarding. The general level had a beverages(beer and wine available) and snacks available. The seats were comfortable and the ride was smooth for the hour trip to Avalon. You can change your return for a $5 service charge. We saw people with luggage spending overnight at accommodations. People were also bringing their bicycles to ride. It is wheelchair friendly too. It was my first visit and we enjoyed walking through time with many choices for lunch. We went to the Catalina museum to see the Dale Chihuly glass sculpture exhibit. It is there through December 11,2017.",Wes W
50,Catalina Express,"Spent the day on Catalina in April, 2017. We had not been there fro several years and we felt like we were on a real mini vacation. The express boat is fast and comfortable.

Had a nice lunch and browsed in the shops.",hasbrouck11
40,Great Comfortable Way to get To Catalina,My husband and I took the Catalina Express yesterday to Catalina round trip. We went regular faire and sat downstairs and paid for Commodare faire and sat upstairs on the return trip. Both trips were nice and fairly smooth. Upstairs each seat has a leather seat. Upstairs the seats offer more leg room are a little more comfortable and you get a free drink and Famous Amos cookies for the $15 additional fee.,ladybug5
50,Commodores club,The best kept secret! Priority boarding and drink service. Such an easy boat ride over to Catalina.

This time we upgraded for (I forgot the official name of those seats) the special seating. We liked the fact we received a complimentary beverage ( it was an alcohol one) , choice of snacks and separate boarding line. The ride was more enjoyable and relaxing than the general boarding. The staff was great too. I think it's worth the extra $ spent. On my next visit to Catalina, will be upgrading my ticket.",Donna L
50,For our 37th wedding anniversary,"It was a lovely smooth ride from Long Beach to Catalina Island for our anniversary. This was our very first time on the Catalina Express and on Catalina Island.

50,What a smooth ride,We took this boat to Catalina Island. We decided to upgrade and what a great idea that was. We sat in a private stateroom by the captain. It was quiet and relaxing.

If you are there first you can score a table and that is nice. If all you want to do is sleep almost any chair will do as they are like airline seats. Go outside for a few minutes to feel the wind. The ride from Long Beach isn't that long. It was a nice experience. The ramp garage is right next to the building to pick up you tickets. Drop everyone and you gear off at the ticket building and then park the car. Have fun.",RADARSHE

40,First visit to Catalina,"If you don't drink, go to the beach or play golf you may get bored after a few hours. We found out that most of Catalina to see by walking around is pretty much restricted to the beachfront area and 1 block in. After shopping a bit walking around the streets there was not much else to do. We killed an hour by doing the cart tour (separate review). Restaurants seem a bit pricey but that is expected in a tourist spot. The Catalina express was a nice ride. Very comfortable. We managed to get earlier tickets when they added a boat and they didn't charge for the change. The return ride was on the catamaran boat which is much larger and more comfortable. A bit confusing where to line up for the return so don't be shy and ASK.",zavalaphilam
40,Convenient way to get to Avalon,"It was a comfortable, safe ride to Catalina. It was kind of a bummer to have to arrive one hour in advance.

We saw the crew just sitting around drinking something. We talked to the captain and he was really rude and said we couldn't see what they were doing. We were on the top level and my older Mom was there. We went to get a crew member to help my husband get my Mom downstairs and the guy just stood there and did nothing. A very kind customer helped my husband help my Mom down the stairs. The sad thing is these people have a Monopoly over this trip. Catalina island is very nice, but a better crew would be nice. The crew to Catalina Island was very nice, but the crew on the way back just didn't care.",Melody R

50,Little known fact: best bloody mary in LA served here,The Catalina Express is quick and on time. They offer plenty of time slots to travel to and from Catalina at your convenience. It is a tiny bit expensive for what it is - but they have the market on getting to Catalina commercially. ALSO: they serve the BEST Bloody Mary's in Los Angeles. Delicious. Makes me want to go to Catalina right now!,sc-fb
50,Beautiful,I definitely recommend going to Catalina Island! It is so beautiful there!! Lots of fun stuff to do. The food was great and the view is indescribable. The boat ride is relaxing but a little cool later in the day. Definitely being something to stay warm on the way back. I also suggest getting in line a little earlier to get a good seat,CrystalHassan
40,Great ride with view of DOLPHINS!!!!,The boat itself can use some remodeling however the staff were pleasant and the ride was smooth with few waves. It was so comfortable my husband and I took a nap to Avalon and back. On the way out we saw several dolphins right near our window. Highly recommend day trip to Catalina Island...well worth it and memorable.,Sharon Brown
50,ONE OF OUR FAVORITE PARTS OF OUR VACATION,"We got up early to ride the Catalina Express to go to Catalina Island. It was the most wonderful little community. They have such wonderful one of a kind shops there. Something for everyone. Parasailing, scuba diving, snorkeling, shopping, visiting the museum where they have an evening showing of a popular movie. There is definitely something for everyone at every age. My family about our next trip there and how we plan to stay on the island. IT WAS FANTASTIC",Delainie A
50,A comfortable voyage,"Four of us made the trip to Catalina Island. Although a very crowded boat, everyone had a seat.

Younger daughter got a bit sea sick, and the gal running the snack stand gave us some crackers and ginger ale without charging us, which was really nice. On the way home, we sat outside and saw an awesome sunset. Even saw two whales flip their tail fins out of the water on the way home.",mafa02
50,Fast and smooth trip on the Catalina Express,"Went out to Catalina to dive at the marine park. Booked a round trip day passage on the Catalina Express....super easy to book a ticket for $70'ish for the trip. Showed up at the pier and was surprised by the pay for parking....that kind of sucked but what can you do? I couldn't take public transportation there.Loading was easy....I stowed my dive gear on the back of the boat and then found a seat. The ship was not very crowded so a lot of room. A steward stopped by a couple of times to see if I needed any drinks. The prices were a bit stiff onboard but that is to be expected.The crossing took about 75 minutes and we were on time. The ride was decent with just a bit of rocking in 6 foot swells.Once docked at Catalina, I walked down the scuba shop, and then headed over to the marine park. Had 2 great dives and then headed back to the pier. I stopped at the pier and grabbed a nice sandwich at the restaurant there, and grabbed few sodas for the ride back. Boarding on the return trip was simple (you get your return ticket in the morning so ensure you don't lose it). The ride back was about the same but the boat was different...this one had a lot of tables and chairs and wasn't quite as comfy as the first boat.Made it back in 75 minutes, offloaded, paid my $12 or in parking and headed home.",buddyboopotato

50,Catalina island tour,"Quick ride to Catalina. I took Catalina Express from Long Beach. If you are prone to motion sickness, take your Dramamine before you get on...don't be like me and take it after. I was really feeling it! Other than that the ride was fine, lots of space. I recommend getting there early if you want to ride outside, inside in general seating was fine for me. Staff was friendly and courteous. Also, if you are traveling on your birthday, you can travel free. Signup before hand when you make your reservation.",LiveLaughLove101
40,Would have given five stars except for the rude agent in Avalon,"The boat is comfortable, fast and efficient. The crew is very friendly and helpful. However on both ends of the trip, the people behind the counter were surly and unfriendly.",xnycop

50,AWESOME!!!!!!! DO THIS IF NOTHING ELSE!,"So, when I found out I was going to a conference in Long Beach I started seeing what I could do while there.

50,"Fast, confortable and very timely. Don't be late!!","Smooth and safe ride for day trip to Catalina with the kids. Dock at Catalina was short walk to all of main strip and beach. Don't be late to shuttle, arrive at least 15 min prior to reservation or they will usually have standby ready to take your place during summer peak days.",castle_lb
50,Loved the Commodore Lounge - well worth the price,"I'm not much for waiting in lines and when I read reviews about booking the Commodore Lounge - I was sold. The price roundtrip for one adult was $103.50 but well worth the extra $15 each way to sit in the Commodore Lounge. The lounge line is loaded first, you get a beverage voucher for a drink of your choice, a little snack and great seats. The lounge is enclosed and very comfortable - think of airline seating... business class. I was so glad we chose to upgrade and can't wait to make our next trip to Catalina!",Jerichong
50,"On Time, Clean & Comfortable","We visited Catalina Island last weekend traveling from Long Beach to Avalon round trip.

We use their convenient port at Dana Point Harbor to travel to Avalon. Go to the website for details to print the pass and book travel. Since my dad has mobility issues, they kindly let him pre-board. Boats of varying sizes at other ports. The one boat used here takes a few minutes longer to get there and costs a few dollars more. Parking is extra. Cash only snack / bar on board. Comfortable seats, luggage stowed for you.Smooth ride over.",maitaimike2015

50,Pretty pricy but great service to catalina,"We did a day trip to Catalina on Saturday on the Catalina Express out of Long Beach. Was a great day, but very pricey - especially since we had to invest in sweatshirts too! Haha. We upgraded to commodore service on way back. Honestly, not sure it's totally worth it - you do get a free drink and small packaged snack, and the chairs recline. But the regular service chairs weren't bad. They say to arrive 1 hour before departure - thats probably excessive, but if its your first time I do recommend getting in line early so you can get a window seat. On the way TO catalina, best seat is the first row on the right side - it has a table and more leg room, plus the best view. On way back, left side is better.",Lisa S
50,Water travel to Catalina in style.,"Catalina Express has this nice value that if it is birthday, you get a round trip ticket for free, you must have one adult paid ticket. The ride both ways was very nice and it added to the birthday experience. I would highly recommend it.",Pfoskett
40,Smooth ride,"Took my 16yrs daughter to Catalina and we took the Catalina express. It's about the only way to get there unless you want to pay for a helicopter ride($150each person each way) going over we purchased the upgrade to commodore lounge for ($15 each person extra) the price for round trip was about $75 each person. The only good thing I can say about the lounge was, you got on first and had a seat inside. But it's up stairs and you have a lot more motion( if you get motion sickness) you also got a free snack( cookies or chips) and a free drink of your choosing ( alcohol or nonalcoholic drink) if you wish to purchase more you can. But they take cash only on the boat! The ride over to the island took about 79minutes.On the trip back we had general seating and had to wait to get on the boat. We sat down stairs inside (less motion) and liked it much better than the top. The ride on the way back took about 70 minutes.Parking is available at the landing. It's $17 per 24hrs and have cash in hand. The crew card machine doesn't work!!!",Robert H

50,Boating in style,"We caught the Catalina Express at 9am, everything when like clock work. We had a friend in a wheelchair but it was not a problem; they assisted us to a very nice area to ourselves. The staff were very polite. Very family orientated. There is a parking fee if you drive to the terminal.",nancylucille
50,Relaxing visit!,"Take my advice, go early. I took the 2:00 PM boat over from the port in Long Beach. We arrived around 3:00. We attempted to rent a gold cart for our day trip but were quickly told ""I'm not open"" by the man sitting in the booth as if he was working. I asked him why he closed so early, he said he's been at work since 8:00 and he wanted to eat dinner! He was waiting on two carts to come back and he was closing shop for the remainder of the day. Wow! Things close early, although the last boat back was at 7:30 PM. So we spent the day walking the island and enjoying the really cool weather.",BJH82107
50,Worth the money,It was a beautiful day to go out. The trip was a little over three hours and we saw many dolphins but only spotted one whale and her calf. The boat was comfortable and the crew very knowledgeable. It is worth the amount of the ticket Must do again when I am in the area.,T8423XSbrendal
50,Get Experience,"If you're in the area and have some time or a local who is just looking for a quick get away, this is great experience. 1st thing you need to know is there are 4 launch points. Long Beach and San Pedro are close to each other but Long Beach has more times available. I highly recommend upgrading your seat which includes a free drink. We did see dolphins both going and on our return trip. When you port in Catalina, there are taxi's and shuttles waiting. I recommend getting there early to get your ticket, then go grab a bit, you start lining up 30 mins prior and the boat leaves at the time indicated. If you go to Long Beach, on the 2nd floor there is a real nice deck where you can sit and wait.",Art M
50,Fun and scenic,"We went for the upgraded lounge tickets and we are glad we did!! The staff was excellent and the ride was smooth. The boat left and arrived on time, both ways. BUT, if you are not up for a potentially freezing ride home, upgrade to inside (lounge)",Orange Crush

50,Great service,Bit of a bumpy ride both to Catalina island and back to Long Island but that was due to the crazy winds in California at the time. Got 2 for 1 as it was my husbands birthday which saved a lot. One of the crew members was very welcoming (didn't catch his name). Overall good journey and comfortable ride.,Lucytravelling91

40,Fast and smooth running service to Catalina,"Easy to book online. The online system is smart enough for one to be able to fix or change a booking.Large boat with plenty of seating and plenty of seats with views.If you want to sit outside not much sense paying the upcharge to sit in the lounge.IF sitting outside make sure to bring a jacket/windbreaker especially in the evening crossings. Overall, not a lot of extras but the boats are stable and move across to Catalina within about an hour.",williamginn
40,Needed a break,Was in Long Beach for a conference we got a break and went to Catalina. The boat was great it was about an hour ride I get a little sea sick and I was feeling it on the ride. I would recommend the Catalina Express to anyone heading to Catalina.,JRK1970
50,Smooth Sailing,Had a wonderful ride on the Catalina Express to Catalina Island for a day of scuba. Smooth ride on a very comfortable ferry. The ship is large enough to slice thru the waves if there are any. Food and beverage available on board. Various levels of pricing depending on what service you may want.,MamanNY
40,Day trip to Catalina Island,"This was my first visit to Catalina Island, and we took the Catalina Express from the San Pedro terminal to Avalon. I tried to book the tickets online for departure from Long Beach terminal, but the time I wanted was not available. I am so glad I called their toll free number! The friendly operator told me that the San Pedro terminal was only a 15 minute drive from my location, and that tickets were available for the times that I wanted. So glad I called!The terminal is easy to find, well marked and offers ample parking space. It is clean, well run and pleasant. The only reason why I am not giving the experience 5 stars is because we had a negative experience at the restaurant inside the terminal: there is a take-out food counter on one side of the terminal, and a small sit-down restaurant and bar right across from the take-out counter. We had plenty of time for sit-down breakfast, and told the waitress what our departure time was when she took our order. And then we waited. And then we waited some more. I finally got up to cancel our food order because we had to board the ferry. Just at that time the food showed up - we had exactly 2 minutes left to eat, and the waitress gave us an attitude about it. We ended up taking the food on the ferry, and we were the very last people to board. Caveat: do not order food at the restaurant, even if you have plenty of time. Also, the take out counter and the restaurant share the same kitchen, so everything is prepared in the same location. Just order whatever you want from the take out counter and eat on the ferry, this will save you a lot of stress.Snooty waitress with bad attitude.Ferry boats are spacious, clean and well operated. Would do it again, minus the restaurant.",ubisono

50,Great excursion,"If you're in Southern California I highly recommend a trip out to Catalina Island. The best way to get there is by the Catalina Express. Their website is easy to use and their catamarans are very nice and well run. A round trip ticket is a little pricey, but they have a variety of pricing options. The ride took about an hour and was smooth the day we went. Catalina is very charming with many things to do while there.",sorrylaurie

The snack bar is cash only but was surprisingly reasonably priced.",Daniel A
40,1 person in your party should grab a window table before stowing luggage,"Stay away from the back of the boat while departing/arriving, to avoid diesel fumes.

You can purchase tickets there or online. For some extra cash, you can ride in the ""Commodore Lounge"". It's a separate seating area with a couple of perks, one of which is early boarding. We chose to ride with the peasants.We arrived an hour early, and were offered seats on an earlier boat. Walked out to the dock and right onto the boat. Seats are comfortable enough for the 1 hour trip. We were on a large catamaran. There was seating inside and two seating areas outside. Dogs are allowed on board, but must be muzzled and leashed. See the website for details on pets.The crew was friendly and helpful. Snacks and drinks are available on board for a price...We enjoyed the trip!",Don R
50,Does what it says,"The boats are around 200 - 400 ppl, takes about an hour to Avalon from LB, and isn't too bumpy usually. the boat is fast and pretty loud, but is overall very easy and is the cheapest way to get to Avalon.Avalon is a world apart from southern california, slow paced, bar-lined beach town, and this boat delivers you.",charlieinspain
40,Comfortable trip,"The ferry I went on was one of the larger one, it was very comfortable, but the best views are outside on the top deck. We past the whale and the capitain advised the passengers to look out the window. Ferries go on time. Purchased my tickets in advance.",Ero40

I experienced the most beauty of the sea, the boat taking the speed on the sea and then experiencing the sea water in your face. Nevertheless the beautiful sun throwing those rays on the sea providing the adding more beauty. Finally reached to the island. Lot of food, drinks and photoshoot scenaries all around. You can hire bikes, battery cars to move around. Battery cars cost $45 per hour and drive along. Returning is an amazing experience when the sun sets. But it was chilled while returning. So warm clothes would be helpful.",TeamOuting

30,Quick way to travel to Catalina,"This is basically a nondescript mode of transportation to Catalina - one of the few, so there isn't a lot of competition. It's surprisingly more expensive than you may think, so look for a Groupon or coupon if you can. You can walk around the boat while it's traveling which is nice.",ingridvjones

You can upgrade to the Commodore which allows you to board first and sit upstairs. You get a complimentary beverage and snack. To board you have to navigate long steep ramps. If you are handicapped just ask and they will provide staff to assist you.",Dan R

They ride at times was a little choppy but not bad. They had a bar/snacks available for purchase. Only problem is if you sit far from the bar, it can be difficult to walk to it due to the waves/ocean. It would have been nice if when the bar was not busy if staff would walk around to ask if you wanted anything.",Kendra K

50,Taken express to Catalina twice over the years,"Taken the express from Long Beach twice over the years, but we discovered a closer location to take it from our third visit to Catalina. Parking isn't easy to find in Long Beach near the terminal. Takes about 45 minutes to get to Catalina Island from Long Beach. We switched to Newport Beach instead because we usually stay in Anaheim and it's a shorter distance than Long Beach which is a close to 50 minute drive since it's closer to LA. Nice to be able to enjoy a day on the ocean and the California sun as you head across from the mainland to Catalina. We'd take the mid morning boat and then leave Catalina around dinner time to head back to Long Beach. You can book online or buy tix on arrival at the terminal. Great views of Long Beach and Catalina.",mariedesjardins

40,Well considering it's the only choice,"There are generally only two ways to get to Catalina Island. This ferry , the Catalina Express, or an expensive helicopter ride. Generally, found it easy to get to the location and park in their garage and walk, in our case fast, because we cut it tight to the dock. Luggage rules are close to Southwest airlines... two suitcases and a carryon per person but they seem a bit looser on the rules when not full. We paid the extra for the Commodore lounge on the second level where you have service similar again to Southwest with snacks and a drink included. Ride over was relative smooth on a rainy night in early december. Now coming back was another story. What we didn't know was though it was a sunny day, the winds were high like 30 mph on the water... so luckily although we had a late boat booked the hotel told us to check as the 1145 am was possibly the only boat going on this day. Apparently, this is common that one cannot leave the island or go to the island if the wind or conditions are too difficult. Helicopters as well may not be able to fly. So watch the weather for wind conditions and check for any possibility of this happening to you. The ride back was very choppy so some got sea sick make sure you bring your dramamine if susceptible to motion sickness. Generally, the employees were nice if a little bored from the repetitiveness of riding back and forth and forth and back to the island.",northernk
50,Most amazing experience and views!!!,"We visited Catalina Island with our friends in late December and took the Catalina Express to get to get the island on Dec 29th. It was pricey to take the Catalina Express however it took approx 1 hour to get to the island which was really nice. It had beautiful weather that day in the 70 deg so we rented two golf carts and explored the island. Everything on the island was expensive, i.e. food, drinks, gifts, etc. so lucky we were able to pack a cooler of food and drinks with us to enjoy for the day :) It was so much for everyone to explore and enjoyed the most amazing views since it was the first time there for all of us! I would recommend to book early as the Catalina Express as it fills up quick, head out early as there's lots to see, pack cooler of food, drinks and snacks, wear comfortable shoes, layer your clothing as it gets warmer later in the day, bring your iphone or camera for pictures and enjoy!",Brenda N
50,Fun and quick,The Catalina express is pretty great. First you get a boat ride which is awesome. It's about 75mins to Catalina or back to Long Beach.Also it was a $5 Uber pool from the LGB airport.$72 round trip tickets per person.,Anastasi M
50,Anniversary Trip,Always a fun and memorable trip. Boat moves along fast enough that those who may get seasick don't even notice it as the ride is so smooth you don't even feel it gliding through the water for the 55 minute trip from Longbeach to Avalon. Also if you go to Costco you can buy discounted ticket package.When in Catalina go to the Coney Island Hamburger stand for a really great burger and fries and later to Armstrong's for a great evening of food and dining.,Alec W

50,A Fun and Effortless Journey to Santa Catalina Island,"Catalina Express offers large sailing vessels to Two Harbors and Avalon on Santa Catalina Island from various Southern California locations. We chose to leave out of Long Beach. The staff were very helpful and after an orderly boarding process, our boat left on-time. The water was very smooth and we felt little to no movement in the water. A little over an hour and we were in Avalon.Our return trip was equally as nice. I highly recommend Catalina Express.By the way, you get to sail for free on your birthday. Register online ahead of time.",Jay A
40,Nice relaxing ride,"Riding over to Catalina Island was a relaxing quiet ride, except the boat had issues and we had to return to Long Beach to have them fix it. The staff was apologetic about the issues but we weren't offered anything because of the issues. We were 30 minutes late arriving to Catalina Island which made us have to rush our tour time on the Island.",jcbishop
40,Pleasant ride to Avalon,"Parking was easy, and we lined up for the boat. Staff are efficient and pleasant. They organized a space at the back for luggage. We saw dolphins in the water, sky was clear, and the ride was smooth. What more could we ask?? A small cafe and snack bar are available at the dock before we loaded in Long Beach, so we were able to have breakfast while we waited for the boat to depart. Food and service were good.",USAwalkers
50,A Beautiful Ocean Adventure,Back in the old days it used to take over two hours to get to Catalina on a rocky old boat. Now you can be there in half the time on a smooth riding comfortable boat. We saw lots of flying fish and hundreds of dolphins riding in our wake hike we sipped delicious drinks.,3rdplanetravler
40,Clean and efficient,Crew was friendly and the fare is reasonable. Enjoyed the hour trip to Catalina. I recommend upgrading the tickets for the ride back to the mainland if you're taking one of the last boats back.,ThreeZy
50,Fun way to travel to Catalina,"When traveling to Catalina Island I recommend using Catalina Express out of Long Beach. Great parking, lots of handicap spaces, beautiful grounds and easy to get around. They have a waiting area which serves food and drink while you wait for the boat to take you to Catalina. Easy boarding process. You have a choice of sitting on the top deck or inside. I sat on top and got very wet from the ocean spray. The trip is about 75 minutes each way. They offer a free one way trip to Catalina on your birthday. I took advantage of it because it's expensive to go round trip. ($ 75 USD ).",Ann R
50,On time and clean,We did a winter deal with metropole for one night stay and roundtrip ferry. Everything went as planned out of Dana Point. The parking is $14/day x 2 for $28 total. The ship itself was clean and bathrooms were clean.,Terry L
40,Easiest way to get to Catalina,"Quick and easy. Dependable. Top deck at sunset, recliner chairs with cupholders for your beer or bloody mary. Then it's smooth sailing to Catalina Island.Stow luggage downstairs and they even have a tank rack for scuba tanks. 1 hr journey and you're there! Can get a little chilly so bring a jacket.Their phone reservation system works great, and they are very helpful. Easy to re-book different boats (for a $5 fee if your ticket has been printed). They have boats starting at 6am and leaving almost every hour or hour and a half, ending at 7pm. Make sure to make a reservation though, as the later ferries back to Long Beach on Sundays are packed full!Cost is $72 round trip, or $64 if you can get a consignment ticket. There's also an AAA discount of $10 I believe.Food and coffee are available in the general seating downstairs lounge, as well as in the Commodore Lounge.Tip: Free on your birthday!",lilicedt

50,Always lovely,"Always a lovely experience on the express... wonderful staff, libations and snacks... just a perfect transition from mainland to the Island ...",ohcurlyone88
50,Great Voyage!,We rode the 6am to Avalon. We reserved tickets over the phone and picking them up was easy. There is a AAA discount available but you need to print it from the AAA website and have your card as well. We could upgrade to 1st class (Commodore) for an extra $15 one way. There was plenty of seating - it was comfortable. A hostess came around as we got comfortable to see if we needed and food / drink from the bar. We sailed on time and arrived in Avalon an hour later after a smooth trip. We saw many Dolphins playing as we got closer to the Island. The island ferry terminal is a short (5 min) walk to the main town area - there were taxi's. Coming back we were on the 7.30pm and it was just as easy and pleasant experience. Parking at the Long Beach Landing is $17 per day. There are restrooms and food / drink options at both departure points.,Reginald S

Booking the trip was very easy (good info online, helpful phone operators) and a great deal (total $150/per person). We got some breakfast at the terminal and were quite surprised by the quality, portion size, and cost - again, a great deal. The trip to the island was uneventful and smooth. Boarding for the return trip was a piece of cake and the trip back was also smooth - crowded so we had to sit up top, outside....but it was fine. Overall a great experience.",k8iep
50,Smooth sailing,"Not necessarily cheap, but it is the most inexpensive way to get to the island. Depending on time of year, there are several time options. We sat outside on the 3rd deck when we departed from Long Beach because the weather was sunny and warm. The views were amazing and it was smooth sailing. Be sure to get in line first if you want to sit outside. It started to rain as we departed Avalon so we opted to sit inside. Seating is comfortable with tables and airline type seating. If the weather was nicer I would have preferred to sit outside.",Virginia Y

40,Trip to Catalina,"Took the ferry to the island for a two day trip. It is not cheap and do not spend the extra money for the commodore lounge it's not worth it. The trip is comfortable on either level and the crew is very service oriented but there was no direction to the higher priced seats when we got on, so we spent the money for nothing. We figured it out on the way back.",ereves
50,Fantastic Day!,"Catalina Express was great. I bought tickets on-line which was very easy. I left from Long Beach. The terminal is big, nice, clean. The boarding process is efficient but you do have to stand in line. Best to get in line early if you want a window seat. The crossing was very smooth. They have some refreshments on board nothing special. The boat was clean and comfortable. It was a great way to spend the day.",MB Q

50,Zip To Catalina With Cat Express,"For $72 round-trip, you can zip off to Catalina Island from Long Beach. Check their site for the most current schedule as boats run at different hours depending on the season. You can easily change yr departure times but it will cost $5 to reprint your ticket.The journey is about 1.15 hrs from Long Beach to Avalon. Once at Avalon, it's walking distance to the main attractions. There is both lower and upper level seating. If you're with a partner, there is 2-abreast seating towards the front of the ship. If you want a view of LB Harbor, head upstairs for an excellent view as the boat speeds away.While $72 is a bit steep, Cat Express is really the only option of getting to Avalon - unless you have your own boat. In which case, you're probably not reading this review.",_glbetrkkr_
50,Island boat ride,Book in advance they have nice clean boats aleast the Long Beach one is and I'm sure the others are the same way . The upgraded seats are inside on the upper deck we didn't feel the need to do that main cabin was just fine the seats are comfortable and they serve snacks and stuff on board we got there for an early trip so stopped at there grill at the terminal before getting on the boat and got some breakfast it was good it actually was pretty good . So if your going to the island check em out they leave from different places so take your choice,Sam612014

It's a little more pleasant than being with the riffraff in the third class.",Jonah O

50,Beautiful place,One of the most beautiful places I've ever been!!Will definitely come back to the island!!The nature is breathtaking!!,Tanya T
40,The best way to Catalina,"We took the Express to Catalina Island and upgraded to the Commodore Lounge. This got us priority boarding, a cookie, and a free drink in the Lounge. Getting on the boat first was nice, but unless you wanted a drink and a cookie, it was not worth the $15/person so we skipped it on the return trip back to Long Beach and enjoyed the ride in the sun and cool breeze. You can still sit in the Lounge once the boat gets underway. Very smooth ride with lots to see on the hour ride to the island.",Scuba-Duner
40,Smooth sailing,"Clean, comfortable boat and the Captain slowed down so we could watch some dolphins leaping and frolicking nearby. A nice experience.",M W
40,"Day-Trippin, Really Between 3 and 4 Stars","Catalina Island is a bit of a rip-off, yet if you end up going you are pretty much also travelling w/ Cat Exp. Actually it is one of the better parts of the trip. Bouncing along upstairs in the open-air level is exhilarating and fun. A taste of the ocean. Words to the unwary- Book well ahead, or you will go at a time not of your choosing, or at a price not anticipated. The ""commodore Lounge"" class gets first crack at departure times, and you get what's left. $75-00 per person for a day trip is just too much.Catalina Island is a testament to what promotion and hype can get you. Especially w/ the drought of the last few years, CI is a arid semi-desert island, w/ a few palm trees and imported sand thrown in. The layout suggests a charming mediterranean coastal village, yet when you are up close there are few public amenities, and many offerings come w/ a price tag. Since it is expensive to live there, the locals include many aging alumni from margaritaville, shuffling along in hawaian shirts trying not to attract undue attention to their age..The best story I aver heard was that George Patton met Beatrice Ayer his future wife in Catalina, yet the vestiges of Calif history were not much in evidence the day we went. It might pay to go in the off-season, when visitors from the outside are minimized.",MomoBobo
40,Visiting Catalina,"First, make sure you book your ferry tickets in advance online.We didn't know about it and when we got to the ticketing desk, most of ferry tickets were sold out. Our only choice was 1:20pm to Catalina and 9:45pm return to Long Beach.This schedule ended up working great for us because we were super flexible but I will recommend to book tickets in advance if you are in fixed schedule.",MrsHMeyer
30,Day Trip,You can't go online to book a ferry ride the same day you are taking the trip. You'll have to go early and buy your ticket at the counter.,Magnolia M
20,Just average,You need to take these ferrys over to Catilina Island. Over priced but can't get there any other way. The island is a must see.,Donald B
40,Rough Ride while Whale Watching,"Catalina Express is essentially the only whale watching company available for trips by the public so they have a corner on the market which probably explains the price. The trip itself was eventful in that many passengers became very sea sick; the trip out was very rough. Great for watching dolphins play, but not much else. We did see some humpback whales on our trip, though these sightings were much too brief and infrequent. For reference, we went in August. Perhaps better during other seasons.",danielml85
50,Fun Ride to an Island,"A great experience riding the Pacific to a large island off the coast of LA. Not much to see, but a enjoyable experience. Takes a while, but fun to see the city disappear behind you, and an Island slowly appearing, while dodging being sprayed by water most of the time.",MikeAlen
50,Catalina Express Lounge trip,"It was a pleasant experience to use a lounge room with nice crew and professional altitude. Clean lounge, good service . Vine and snack were served, bar is available.Nice music we enjoyed view from window and trip was very comfortable and not long approximately 50-55 min.",Rafael A
50,Pleasant trip,"Big boats, ample seating and being a catamaran the most comfortable way to cross from Long Beach to Catalina. If the boat is overbooked there is always the chance of a standby seat. Refreshments are available on board and both our crews were very pleasant but efficient. There is ample parking nearby, we parked a ten minute walk away across from the aquarium and only spent $15 for the day.",Keith F
50,Upgrade to the Commodore Lounge,"We decided to pay the extra $15.00 each way to upgrade to the Commodore Lounge. First of all, you get to board and disembark first and the lines are considerably shorter. The chairs are very comfortable and lean back. The additional fee includes one beverage, either alcoholic or non-alcoholic, and either a savory or sweet snack, both of which are served to you at your seat. The windows appeared to be larger, so that is a plus too.",Justine L
50,On The -Road- To Catalina,"This Catalina Express left from Long Beach Port. If one opts to leave their car, there is a parking structure with a fee. We selected a one day only birthday adventure; this time. Therefore, to maximize our stay, we made reservations for a 6AM departure with an 8PM return. The trip over was comfortable, quiet and smooth; as was our return. My personal preference was to take an OTC prevention for potential anxiety; worked like a charm. Perk: Free RT passage on your birthday; just present your valid ID. 🍾",Cassy_Kat

30,Quick & Fairly Easy Trip to Catalina,"The one snag we had happened at check-in. Our reservations had been misspelled by the person taking them over the phone. So it looked like we didn't have ANY reservations! When we finally solved the problem, the agent didn't even say ""Sorry"" for the hassle! :(Also, we never learned where the life jackets were stored, only how to wear them. :/Otherwise, the trip was uneventful. The loading and disembarking were smooth.",Gretchen S
50,Brothers visit,Took the Catalina Express to Catalina and had a great time. The boat ride was fun and scenic and very comfortable and cool. Had a great time on the island as well good shopping and great food.,snoymm
40,A little crowded,Went on a group trip of three adults and two babies. The crew was very friendly but a note to anyone else traveling with babies you cannot wheel your strolle down the boat ramp with the baby in it. The baby has to be carried.Inside the main cabin it can get pretty crowded (think airplane coach status). Up top there seems to be a lot more room as people don't want to deal with the crazy breeze but if you're willing too (and I'd suggest bundling up) it's a lot nicer and you can see more than just a little bit out of the windows.Drinks like would be expected are over priced but no more than an airplane. There is no where to change a baby except right in your seat so be prepared!Overall smooth trip and friendly people.,TkOeUeCpH
30,Great mode of transport to Catalina Island,"Professional and reliable service to Catalina. The cost is a bit much, but, it basically is the only game in town. With frequent launches to and departures from the island, you can plan your stay with confidence, whether it's a day trip or overnight. My only issue was an incident recently during questionable weather. Although the island was clear, there was a storm front moving in. The communication of the boat company to the island visitor's center, tour vendors and Catalina express customers was dismal. It literally caused a panic as tour vendors and locals voiced their opinions, not fact, that tourists were stranded as the boats back to Los Angeles and long beach had been canceled for the afternoon. The results, lines of 400+ people jockeying for position to get to boats. Children being shoved and adults fighting. Hotels price gauging those who tried to find shelter for the night in fear of not making the remaining boats.",chicagoborn40
50,First time on the Ocean,My wife and I planned to go to Catalina for my birthday and the best part was that my trip there and back was free because of a promotion running this year. We arrived early to be able to park in the garage provided. The only down side to the whole experience was that the parking was 17.00 which seemed high to me. Everyone in the terminal was very friendly and helpful. We sat up on the top deck on the way there and it was just great. The ride was very smooth and relaxing. On the way back we were tired so we sat inside on the lower deck. The seats were comfortable and some even had tables. There was also a little bar inside. We had a wonderful ride and a great time in all.,Braddock52
50,San Pedro Terminal,"Amazing boat ride. We have been to Newport,and Long Beach but San Pedro's terminal is definitely the cleanest and easiest to get in and out of. The bathrooms are clean, the little bistro in the terminal is a perfect spot to enjoy a cocktail before your boat ride. I'm thinking we will start driving the extra miles to leave out of this terminal due to the fact that it was a wonderful experience.",hodieduran
50,"Nice getaway, comfy ride","We went to Catalina to celebrate my husband birthday. Making reservations for the boat was quick and easy.Parking to drop off the car was close by the terminal. We checked in and were surprised how full the boat was. Many people going for the day with no luggage and quite a few with suitcases.The ride over at 1:20 was smooth, the seats are upholstered and comfortable. There are snacks and beverages avaiLable on the boat. It's about an hour and the time goes by quickly.When we arrived, we walked to our hotel, they r all centrally located. Thee are lockers for people that are there just for the day. We spent the night and returned the next day. Once again, it was quick and easy. Highly recommend Catalina express. If u go on your birthday it's free and if u r a senior there is a discount.It hasn't changed much, other than there is less beach due to erosion. Lots of shops, bars and restaurants, a special trip, only 25 miles from long beach!",sue b

Friendly staff wishes you a happy birthday at boarding on and getting off. The ride to and from is approximately one hour each way. What a great adventure!",FitnessTrekker
50,THE way to get to Catalina,"The boats are large, fast, and comfortable. They run on time and are reasonably priced. The crew is attentive and safety minded. It's easy to take your dive gear and check it when you come aboard. If you want to sit in a particular area, then you need to line up more than 30 minutes before and there is not shade in Long Beach or in Avalon where you line up, so be prepared for that. However, anywhere on the boat is comfortable, however. We sat in the bow in the middle and were able to read and enjoy the trip.",Tony K

40,Day Trip from Long Beach,"I booked our tickets online for a return trip. Printed of my confirmation sheet to take with me. Parking is offered for $17 for 24hrs. We were oversized and were worried about fitting in the parking structure ( we had a Thule on my Dodge Journey) but they have parking on the opposite side of the structure with a higher opening. It would be good if they advertised this as we started to enter the structure and then had to back out with a long line of traffic right behind us making it very difficult. Once parked we went to the main counter and exchanged my voucher for tickets. We lined up outside for about a half hour. Boat was larger than I expected and seating was similar to airline seating. Seats were comfortable enough and there were plenty of windows to see. There is a concession on board although we did not partake. Lots of different kinds of ships and boats to see. We also saw sea lions diving on the journey. It took less than an hour. On the return trip, we lined up about 45mins before boarding. It would do well for them to have some shaded or covered parts of the line up area, it was extremely hot standing in the full sun at 4:30 in August waiting to board.If you suffer from motion sickness, you would be wise to take something. I had no problem on the way there but the ride back made me quite nauseous even though the sea was mostly calm. My husband also complained of feeling off after getting off the return trip. Over all a good experince. The Island is amazing.",Disneylovers2000

20,Very bumpy and rude staff,"The ride is not the smoothest and very bumpy. My son got sick and puked all over. Not really their fault, but the comfort level on the boat is not the best. Next, when purchasing the tickets it said it would be a 1 hour 15 minute ride from San Pedro to Avalon via Two Harbors. No explanation of what that meant. Come to find out that we had to stop in Two Harbors which then made the trip over 2 hours to get there. Just way way too long to be on that boat especially when it is not comfortable. There was nothing that said it would take over 2 hours when we purchased the tickets. We only got to spend about 2 hours on the island because of this. On the way back was supposed to be 1 hour 15 minutes but again took over 1 hour 30 minutes.The staff on the boat are not very friendly. I can see why as the job probably sucks. My children were running down the isle and the employee woman snapped at and grabbed my 3 year old. I understand the no running part but the entire trip there were about 10 kids running up and down the stairs and up and down the aisles. Needs to be enforced uniformly and also the employees are just plain rude about it. Catalina would have been a great trip except for the Catalina Express.",lataskata

30,It's a necessity,"There really isn't much to say about the transportation to Catalina Island which is a must see!! The boat ride over and back was as expected. We were lucky as the water was calm that day. It's unfortunate that it costs so much to get to that beautiful island. I'm not sure if there is any other means of getting there that would be cheaper... If so, I would do it.",Wendy526
40,Easy. Fast. Fun!,"Great experience. Easy to get tickets and make changes if necessary. The ride is smooth (even in moderate chop) and enjoyable. Don't waste your money on the Commodore Club, but DO board as soon as possible to claim a seat up top. Bring hats, sunscreen, and jacket as it can be a bit chilly. Overall a fun trip!",TrippinSC69
10,Horrible customer service and criminals,"These guys have the worse customer service I have ever experienced. Plus, they are criminals. They want to keep our money for the upper deck to have us stand by for the lower deck, then pay again to get the upper deck. Unbelievable! I will never use Catalina Express again!",MJClarkWestHollywood
40,Best way to Catalina,"I booked a round-trip voyage from Long Beach to Avalon on-line. The directions to the Long Beach dock and parking structure were quite clear on the ticket. The structure is directly across from the terminal and is $17 per day. I booked the first boat out at 6 am; the terminal ticket counters and concessions open at 5 am. I had upgraded to the Commodore Lounge, so I was given both my tickets and drink vouchers at the ticket counter.There are several boats of various sizes making the voyage, and not all of them have Commodore Lounges. We were allowed to board first from a separate line. we shlepped our own luggage on board and deposited the larger suitcases in an open area behind the regular seating area. There seemed to be a crew member watching the luggage. The Commodore Lounge was upstairs. It's a smaller seating area with its own snack bar, servers, and somewhat wider seats. You are offered a free drink (including alcoholic) and a packaged snack (cookies or a savory mix). This particular boat (actually a catamaran) did not have restrooms within the Commodore Lounge, but they were just outside, on the rear outdoor deck. This boat actually had 2 levels of outdoor seating. I am not a sea-faring person, so I got a bit queasy, but the A/C and going outside helped. Once in Avalon, everyone exits together, to the rear if you have luggage to collect.The trip from Avalon back to Long Beach was on a slightly smaller catamaran. Once again, we boarded first. This boat had a dedicated luggage area with racks and doors that were closed during the voyage. The Commodore Lounge had its own restroom and was once again upstairs. There was one outdoor deck. This ride seemed smoother; I fell asleep and awoke just as we were passing the Queen Mary in Long Beach.A lot of people take advantage of the free trip you get on your birthday--they give you this badge/ribbon thing you have to wear. You have 30 days to return from Catalina. I don't know if you can upgrade to the Commodore Lounge off a free B-Day ticket.A convenient and fun way to get to Catalina.",pillowsofwanderlust
50,THE ONLY WAY TO GO TO CATALINA,"We had a great experience. Hop on board early, get our seat near the back, outside, so you are out of the wind. Kick back and relax ready to enjoy the journey. we had lots of ships to look at, dolphins and nature at its best.",SenorGancho

50,Very Civilized,"My wife and I took the Catalina Express between Long Beach and Avalon. I splurged and got tickets in the Commodore Lounge. Very nice. This was an upgrade to the standard tickets and will get you advance boarding, exclusive seating area (away from steerage) and a drink coupon. The ride was very smooth since the boat is a catamaran. On the way out it was early in the morning so we ordered coffee, but on the way back we had a nice cocktail. Snacks are also provided. The service is cheerful and you may meet a new friend. I would definitely recommend paying the additional $15 cost and make the trip more memorable by booking the Commodore Lounge. Be sure to follow their recommended arrival times as they do keep to their schedule.",Ricksteraux
50,The best public way to Catalina,"These fast jetboats are very safe and a fast way to get to Avalon or Two Harbors on Catalina Island. The schedule is several times per day. And, you can travel free on your birthday - a great bargain since the fare has gotten quite steep outside of a ""package.""",VictoriaTravelsToo
50,Weekend getaway,"This trip is a blast!!! We stayed at one of the finest hotel in this island getaway and everything was great. My suggestion is you must stay at least 2 days to enjoy the scenery, the water, the island and be sure to rent a golf cart that fits your family. For bikers they can also rent bikes here. Swimming, food, nightlife and the island itself made our weekend a weekend to remember. Hotels can be pricey specially weekends but you can get good deals if you plan ahead. Hope this helps specially it's summer guys. Enjoy!!!",joel matt romul... m
50,I love to visit Catalina!!,"There are many activities to do on the island- snorkeling, parasailing (fun on a hot day!!), scuba diving, zip line, golf, touring the island (bike or golf cart), hiking, and really cool wildlife (bison, seals, sea lions, foxes, salamanders, frogs, lizards, butterflies, and birds). And if you like to take it easy, you can sit on the beach and watch the waves. There are many restaurants with the best food!! (breakfast at Jack's or Pancake Cottage! Yummm!!)",Debbie R
40,The way to go,"I have been a long term user of Catalina Express as I live on the island. Even though I travel to Newport Beach, I prefer the convenience of the Long Beach boat schedule. The parking is easy the lounge has a good selection of libations and food and trip is relaxing.Summer season requires booking ahead!Worried about the notion on the ocean? Sit in the center downstairs.",momcat117
50,Make sure you leave out of the Long Beach Terminal,The fastest way to Catalina is out of the Long Beach Terminal. They also have a terminal in San Pedro and Dana Point. The trip is a little more than an hour. You go by the Queen Mary and the big Cruise ships on the way out!,Ron S
40,Exciting (but the air conditioning's way too cold),"We take for granted too many things. The ease of getting to the marvelous island of Santa Catalina is one such example. This is a first-rate company with swift catamarans and professional crew members. On the beautiful day-trip we took the outward journey was exciting and the breeze refreshing. The $15 upgrade for the Commodore Lounge on the return (economy was all sold out) was acceptable, but the temperature was way too cold. I was told that this is done to keep down sea sickness, but the rise on this evening was a smooth as silk. One needed change: the ticket window sellers in Long Beach could use additional training in courtesy and line control. Our first impression wasn't the best. Also, the parking deck is conveniently located but packed and expensive.",Alan B

20,Smooth Journey with bumps,"The best way to go to Catalina. Discounts available from Auto Club or sometimes Costco has gift cards. Free trip on your birthday. Very convenient location in Avalon, and easy to roll a carry-on to a hotel.Large, comfortable ship with seating indoors and some outside for those who like the windblown look.Three issues on this trip.We went as part of a group, and thus our tickets were bought together. We sought to change our departure time to a later ship, which had space, from our earlier ship which already had a wait list. Thus, our switch would not cost Catalina Express any revenue.Can't do it. Why? Our ""Group"" tickets were marked ""30 Day Limited Exchange,"" ""Ticket Exchange Fee May Apply,"" and ""Refund and Exchange Restrictions Apply."" But the ""contract"" which no has to show you (yes, we asked, it's available from ""headquarters"") bars any exchange on a group ticket. The words on the ticket? They are printed on every ticket. They have nothing to do with the ""Contract."" Advised that some of our group had ""Adult"" tickets which permitted exchanges, we walked back and ran into group members with ""Adult"" tickets. We switched. (Tickets are not identified to any individual, unlike airline tickets.)We returned to the ticket office and exchanged the adult tickets for a later ship. $5 fee per exchange, which is fine. And the words printed on the Adult ticket? The same as the ""Group"" ticket because ""they are printed on every ticket."" Nope, that's not true. The ""Adult"" tickets say, ""No Refund No Exchange"" twice, in English and in, well, English. They also have the same refund and exchange fees and restrictions may apply language. And we asked the clerk, who said, even though it says ""No Refund No Exchanges,"" twice, that's not what the ""contract"" says.So we've learned a valuable legal lesson without the expense of law school: The words on a ticket don't count. They don't even have to make sense.Second issue: Our later ship had to return to disembark several unruly passengers. While the Captain should do whatever is necessary for safety, that made our typical 1 hour voyage last 1 hour and 45 minutes, coupled with the urging by staff to line up 30 minutes early. Line up at 9:15 p.m., arrive Long Beach 11:30 p.m.Third issue: the garage (about $18, credit cards OK) had every exit functioning and had a few additional staff directing traffic. It still took just over 30 minutes from starting the engine to exiting. This is a design defect, and not the fault of the staff.It's still the best way to go to Catalina.",SoCalTraveler91356
50,Birthday Island,I took advantage of the free birthday passage. This is a great deal and everyone makes a big deal wishing you happy birthday. Freebies abound!

We had a great day on the island. Easy to book and to register online.,beckyatlarge
40,To Catalina and back via Commodore lounge,"-if you book online the week before, the fare was less then at walk up.-commodore lounge does seem to get you a quicker exit off the boat-when you park in the parking structure at Catalina Landing be aware some of the rows of stalls are wider then others-if you come back on a full boat remember that if you are not one the folks getting to the cashier exit booth early, be prepared to wait in line a bit as there are two booths for everybody tyring to exit the structure-also remember if u park on the lower levels, consider backing into the spot to make breaking into the long line easier-does not take amex-if you don't need to use the elevator, than consider taking the walkway that goes from level P2 without having to cross traffic and take the steps closer to the landing building",KidnDoc

30,Simple transportation,"It took just over an hour to get there on s smooth ride, I usually get seasick but not in this round trip. The place was had to get to but just make sure you trust your GPS.

It fills up fast, so I had to stand by the mini bar and enjoy a cold beer :-).",Francisco T

The boat ride is fast 1 hr trip try to get there early as the general admission is first come first serve unless you pay extra $15 each for Comodore Lounge. Good seats are on the bottom middle lounge close to the snack bar. Top deck area is very rocky and bumpy, snack bar is pricey. Boat was clean and there staff are good.

Smooth, relaxing, one hour ride to the Island. Went on a tour of the Casino, walked around, ate, people watched, shopped, and before we knew it, it was time to board the EXpress boat back to Long Beach. Great day. Can also rent a golf cart to get around; go zip-lining, etc. Definitely a must do!",Sonna E
50,A Great Day Trip...Easy to Extend,The crossing to Catalina is a delight on this boat. It's like flying without any hassles. My only prayer when I ride (sail) is that the ocean is calm.The crew is friendly. The boat is comfy and has outside area to spot dolphins or flying fish.And the special perk is that your round trip fare is FREE on your birthday. Just call ahead to let Catalina Express know.Have fun.,John B
50,Love the Express,Have used the Catalina Express for many years. Have traveled with my 9 week old baby on her first trip and multiple trips since then. Have taken two preteens who were so excited they couldn't sit still. My favorite trip was with my attention seeking Maltipoo who couldn't keep his muzzle on. It kept slipping off his short nose. Have also turned older children over to the care of the crew and they were closely watched during the short trip.,jlwitaly

Our schedule was very tight both ways and the boats were right on time.We have been Express riders for decades and have seen the service continuously improve. The new catamarans are amazingly fast and very smooth. Traveling at 35 miles an hour gets you to Avalon from Long Beach in one hour.We recommend getting to the Long Beach terminal early since it is a little tricky to find if you are driving. Being early in line also gets you a better seat when boarding.",Richard W

You can sleep if you're comfortable enough.Ferry ride took 1 hour and about 25 minutes. They also took some luggage below so you don't have to keep it in you on your seats. Be careful when going outside or just plain walking to restrooms or side of the boat.The one going back home is bigger and more comfortable.

50,On Our Way,"Have traveled many times to Catalina Island using the Catalina Express. To me, it is the easiest way to get there and now that Southwest Airlines flies into the Long Beach Airport, it makes it even more convenient. I would suggest that you book your trip in advance so that you can get right onto the scheduled ferry that you have chosen. At some times of the year they do get busy and if you wait, you may not get on the ferry you prefer. We usually are packing allot of dive gear for the island and these ferry's have plenty of storage. I have never had a problem with anything that they have put in storage, as they seem to be very careful. All in all, the boats, attendants and all involved at Catalina Express make for an enjoyable hour ride across the water to Catalina. One word of caution. If you are booking with Super Shuttle or someone else for a ride to the airport, be very careful. On occasion just like everything else, there may be a mechanical problem which may delay your return to the harbor, thus making you miss your scheduled pick up. Make sure you have working numbers to inform as it can expensive if you don't call ahead and let them know.",Tedd B
50,Great trip,Be sure to book in advance especially during the summer months. If you go online and sign up to their website they send you a FREE birthday trip to the island. The only downside is you must go on you actual birthday.. This boat is a catamaran and very smooth ride across the ocean. Quick only 1 hour.... Friendly personel and very clean..,abakerPS
40,Fun!,This was a fun little getaway. We went and came back the same day. I do suggest a hat and blanket/jacket for the boat. It gets pretty breezy the further out you get. Lots of great restaurants and little shops to check out.,M V
40,Book ahead of time or you will wait for the next ferry!,We always decide to go last minute and most time we have to wait for an hour or two because the ferry fills up fast. Make a reservation ahead of time (you have to be at least 24 hours in advance). But we have always enjoyed talking with others on the ferry and love going out to Catalina Island!,Lisa

40,Wonderful customer service!,We took a trip to Avalon recently while visiting California. Everyone that we encountered seemed very friendly and informative. The boat ride was good and time on the island so much fun! We were able to schedule a time for the zip line while waiting to board the boat which was helpful. We would take this boat ride again on a future visit,Krystal T
40,Getting there is half the fun,"I took my kids to Avalon for the weekend and the boat trip was one of the best parts. We left from San Pedro in the heart of the Port of LA. Parking is pricey ($30/d) so consider getting dropped. The catamarans operate out of Long Beach, so from this port you get monohull boats, but it is still a fast crossing. Check the baggage size limits on the website and make your carry on small. The crew is swift, friendly and efficient; and yes, there is a bar.My highlights were sailing past the USS Iowa and seeing hundreds of Pacific white sided dolphins.",michaelh409
50,Fun!,One of the best parts of the trip to Catalina Island was definitely the boat ride. We sat outside and drank and few drinks and relaxed on our way to and from Catalina. We enjoyed the scenery.,Caitlin W
40,Commodore Lounge on the Catalina Express,"We took the Catalina Express on June 5, 2016. We sat in the Commodore Lounge which is more expensive but comfortable and nice. We got a complimentary beverage and great service. The trip takes 1 hour each way. When we boarded in Long Beach, we bypassed the line and walked straight onto the ship due to the upgraded tickets. There were many people returning to Long Beach at the end of the day and it took a little longer to board. Still a much shorter line than general boarding. We would take this trip again",Mindy Mac

50,First class experience in the Commodore Lounge,Went to Catalina Island for the first time this week.

50,Pleasant Ride,"Being a modern catamaran, the ride over the 26 miles was smooth and quick. They are well organized for ticketing and boarding.

You also get great discounts on the stores. It was a great one hour on the ferry & I also got to see some dolphins swimming nearby! Loved this trip!",Anna H
40,First time to Catalina,Used the AAA Discount to get $7.50 off a round trip ticket. The line was large when we got there but moved quickly. When on the boat there was plenty of seating and cocktails available to buy at the bar. Cash only. Overall smooth ride.,SneakyManny
50,Smooth Ride,The Catalina Express was a very clean fairy with a very comfortable ride. Was able to see a few dolphins from the upper deck.,octjazz
40,Good Ride to Catalina Islands,"Catalina Express provides services to reach from the mainland to Catalina Island and this express is the only means to reach there. Make sure you book tickets at least a week in advance as the tickets sell out very fast or even if you get the tickets, it may not be as per your convenience and you might be forced to book the Lounge.Always look to book for General Seating if you can. We booked the Lounge for our onward journey (since tickets were all sold out and were not as per the timings we wanted). However, we were able to get General Seating on our return journey. We felt the General was more comfy than the Lounge. The only additional stuff you get in the Lounge are: just 1 drink coupon and snacks (for namesake purpose and was very average), which in my opinion are completely worth missing and paying extra for it is totally not worth.Now coming to the ride - the ride is short and fairly pleasant. We saw few dolphins jumping in and out of the water, which was nice :) ... You can stand at the back of the express and take good photos, but mind you - it is very very windy during the ride and very bumpy. So, if you are not used to bumpy rides or have motion sickness - it is best to have a motion-sickness tablet.PS: While booking - there are multiple board and drop-off points, so you can check and plan accordingly. For instance, boarding from Long Beach has more timings / options when compared to other points.",coolme_kiran
30,"Yachta, Yachta, Yachta","The cost: Round trip fare for general seating will cost around $75. A $30 round-trip upgrade to the Commodores Lounge will score you priority boarding, comfortable seating, and a free beverage and snack.The port: The Catalina Express departs to Catalina Island from several ports, including Long Beach, Dana Point, and San Pedro, with a cruise duration of about an hour each way. The Catalina Landing at Downtown Long beach, the port that my party sailed out of, is within walking distance to several wonderful waterfront restaurants, including P.F. Chang’s, Gladstone’s Long Beach, and Queensview Steakhouse. Inside the terminal, you will find a small restaurant, a bar where you can get snacks and drinks, Atm’s, restrooms, a lounge area, and a reservation desk where you can book sightseeing tours and golf cart rental reservations for Catalina.The cruise: Embarking and disembarking the ship was a snap due to the priority boarding (lines looked much longer for general seating). There is a spot for luggage when you first board the ship, but I don’t know if security actually watched over it during the cruise. Both crossings were fairly smooth (although a couple in our party did get a bit sea sick—bring Dramamine and ginger candy just in case). There's a concession/bar area where you can purchase drinks and snacks, but it is not cheap. Bathrooms on board are best avoided if you can help it.The view: As the ship approaches Catalina Island you will get an extraordinary view of the marina and Avalon!",buttereyes

I was shocked at the almost 200$ cost because the only return tickets were The Commodore, lounge, fine, its our anniversary. The going to Catalina was ok, nothing special. On the return we arrived at 2:55 and waiting in the extremely hot sun, as no shade provided for 20 minutes, agin whatever. The ramp opened and the ages took our entire tix and one of our drink coupons, I assumed this was normal. We arrived at The Upper Lounge and The woman attendant barked "" Where are your stubs? Why only 1 drink coupon?"" I informed her the agent took them and responded"" you can't be here, need to leave!"" very rudely. I informed he we paid and she didn't care. So I spend me email receipt and tried to show her, she refused. Meanwhile a huge line of people formed, chaos. I found a manage as we could not sit. He finally retuned with the stubs and graciously let us sit down. The rude lady returned, scowled and said, "" Its company Policy"", no apology, no drink, no apology from manage.

50,Smooth Sailing,"The ride to Catalina takes about an hour and a bit. If you purchase the Commodore Lounge which is an extra $15.00 per one way ticket, you board first and sit on the top level of the boat. It is I think an easier ride for those who tend to get a bit sea sick, you receive one drink and a snack as you board. For those who do not want to purchase the lounge you are boarded after the Commodore line and will sit on the lower level of the boat which is good but just a bit too rocky for me.",snookiet
50,Water Uber to Catalina,"The easiest way to get to Catalina. The late afternoon ride can be a bit windy and have choppy seas but the later boat at 5:00 is smooth sailing and you will hardly feel like you are on the ocean. Can be almost ""standing room only"" so be prepared. Try to get a seat in the front of the boat for the smoothest ride. Outside provides riders with ocean spray whether you want it or not so don't think you are getting the best seat if you rush to one of the deck seats. Snacks and drinks are available for purchase. Clean bathrooms on all decks. For an added fare, the Commodores cabin is available but it is not really necessary.

Our family of four sat together in very comfortable seats facing each other. The hostess was very pleasant and the coffee was good. We had an opportunity to watch some whales on the return leg. we hired a buggy and toured the island. Not for the faint hearted, as we choose the less beaten path with sights high above sea level. It was all worth it. We played mini golf and had a ball. So much fun. My husband who does not like traveling by sea now wants to go again. I am up for it.",cparuoma

50,Free on your birthday,"Personally speaking, I believe everyone should visit Catalina Island once in their life.The Catalina Express is not the only way to get to Catalina but it is obviously the cheapest. There were two boats that would take you from Long Beach to Catalina and the slower boat was cheaper. However, now they all have the same price and they are all fast boats. It takes anywhere from 40-50 minutes to get to Catalina Island and the boats run throughout the day. Make sure you note the time of the last boat departing Catalina so you are not stuck on the island. Hotel prices on the island are at tourist rates and I really cannot remember an offseason except during the winter.The ride is always smooth and enjoyable, and the boats even have bars on them. During the summer if you walk up to the top deck, you often see dolphins swimming alongside and sometimes you can even see a whale or two. If you register online, you get a free trip on your birthday. I must stress that the free trip is only on the actual day of your birthday and not during the week of. The Catalina Express staff will give you a ribbon to put on your shirt showing everyone it's your birthday. Make sure you wear the ribbon because practically every gift shop and restaurant will give you a free gift or a discount for wearing the ribbon.",LA-Gluttony
50,Great Boat Ride,"This is lot of fun to take over to Catalina and really this is your only choice unless you have your own boat! From Long Beach, it's 22 miles over to the island and they have 2 classes of service. One includes a drink, a nicer chair and the upper level of the boat for a little better view. You're on a Catamaran and they will also allow you to bring some larger items like bikes or coolers but check the website for what you're allowed. I've gone several times and always enjoyed the ride.",cowstars
50,"No Hassell Ride to Avalon, Catalina Island",Smooth ride to Catalina Island. Professional staff and operation.Their years of experience make this trip a pleasure. Traveled to Avalon for an afternoon of food and fun returning to Long Beach late afternoon. Enjoyed view of Queen Mary along the way. Trip on Catalina Express was a pleasure.,JP_VT2013
50,Great Way to Travel to Catalina,Went to Catalina this weekend by way of Catalina Express. The experience was so much fun!. The waters were choppy and that made for an enjoyable fun ride. If you have general seating make sure you arrive on time for the best seats. If the water is choppy you will get wet if you sit on the deck seats towards the back of the boat. If you want roomier seating there is a more expensive ticket that gives access to the Commodore Lounge. The trip to Catalina is about an hour long so I didn't have the need to 'upgrade'. Drinks and snacks are available for purchase. The staff handled the luggage and the passengers effectively and efficiently. I would definitely travel with Catalina Express again.,Nvr2Late2Live
50,Great,My husband travels with them once a week. When we go as a family we are always pleased with their service.,Meryl F

40,Nice Ride,The desk staff act as though they havr some place better to be but the boarding staff and crew were great.Parking was fine but dont buy in $17.00 per day. Anything no matter how slight escalates the fee.The vessels were fine and they got me there. I elected to stay longer and they changed my reservation for a small fee.It's not like you have much choice to get to Avalon so it is what it is.,OneFlight53
50,"Comfortable, Easy, Well oiled Express!","Eons ago I visited Catalina and my memory of the trip across the water was that the ride was unpleasant, stuffy cabin, rough crossing, a foggy memory but I wasn't looking forward to this part of our trip at all for a weekend in Catalina. All those memories are replaced with good ones! It was a great ride! They ask that you arrive an hour early before your boarding time, which for us was about 2pm, so we arrived at noon (2 hrs early) - left our bags in our car, and checked in (no line at this time to check in because we were so early!) then we walked the 10 min walk to the aquarium where there were several restaurants to choose from and had a quick lunch and walked back, grabbed our bags and stood in line to board.We chose to sit on an upper deck in the sun. It was a nice day, warm not too warm and sunny. We enjoyed the sunshine, but the noise of the engines could be heard the whole way, kind of droning sound. The combination of that and the sun, left us a little headachy after the 1 hr ride. For the return trip we sat inside, it was nice and quiet, good air conditioning and that was real pleasant! Even though there was wind chop on the water I thought the ride was smooth and enjoyable. I recommend riding inside over the outside.",pupit
50,The only way to get to Catalina,"It may not be worth it to get a Commodore Room pass unless the weather is bad, but this is a comfortable and easy way to get to Catalina. They run on time. Get there about 20 minutes before boarding.",Christmas2010
40,Our Best Choice,"Nice well tended ship and crew. A very nice waiting area with small cafe and clean bathrooms. May I suggest that you keep an eye on your luggage upon departing the vessel, as it has a centrally located baggage area and my bag was ""mistakenly"" carted off by another passenger that I intercepted.",JohnOmaha_Nebraska
40,Do the Birthday Run!,"I have been visiting Catalina since 1963. I love it, love it, love it! You step off the ship (or cat) and you just feel your body r-e-l-a-x. Great for a day or a week-end ..... or a whole week of kicking back.",Carol C

50,Speed AND comfort,"Chose to go to Catalina for a day trip and found that Catalina Express offers the most daily departures, we were able to pick and choose both our departure and return times. Friendly service from beginning to end, smiles all around with the employees seeming very knowledgable about what to do and where to go once we got there. Will definitely go again, will for sure use Catalina Express and I recommend it everyone!",Judy R

Bring cash they do not take credit cards.Not the cleanest but with all the on and off travelers I can understand.Get their early to get the best seats.The windows seats are great, we saw a large school of dolphins swimming next to the boat.",tessalovestravel
50,Coolest 50 Minutes Ever!,"This ride is the best! A lot more expensive than it was 25 years ago, lol! But still great!On the way back from Avalon, we saw 2 whales on our way back to Long Beach and the Captain of our boat, actually went a bit off course and shut off the engines and invited us all out to the front deck to watch & photograph the Whales! It was so cool! Great Experience!!! Can't wait to take the voyage across again with you all!",Krebsy724
50,Serious Transportation,"Boarding this boat is just like taking an airplane, and they treat it as such. You are allowed to take luggage, etc. aboard.They run a tight schedule, but it's all good.It takes about an hour to get there, in very comfortable seats. You can have drinks and snacks. There is seating inside and out.It's best to make a reservation, as you never know what days they will be busy.And for those who get seasick, with it being a catamaran, there is not much rocking.",Holly P
50,Perfect,"It's magic in Catalina, get there, and stay there anyway you can. Long beach is the cheapest way there, because LAX is a cheap flight, and Long Beach itself is cheap.",Charlie S

40,Finally,"I'd been living in Long Beach for over 12 years but never got a chance to visit Catalina Island. But after 14 years since I left CA to serve our country, I finally got a chance to come and visit this place with my own family via Catalina Express. We were early when we got to the station but almost missed our boat. We weren't quite informed that our time slot were cancelled and had moved forward due to lack of passengers. Thankfully, I had that an odd feeling and asked an attendant. Anyway, we were able to get in and headed to the island. The ship did take us about an hour from Long Beach Port to Catalina Island Port. The ride was somewhat smooth, ocean was calm most of our ride. The interior of the ship offers lower deck and upper deck. Some part of the upper deck is an upper class seatings. We stayed at the lower deck the whole time. Most of the seatings in that area comes with a table which was cool. My espouse was able to rest its legs from it after our kids ate their snacks from the boats little cantina. It offers a variety of small meals, snacks, drinks including beer at decent price...not a theme park snack price. The staffs are helpful and friendly. There's a storage stow for larger luggage. You may store your small hand carry items and luggage under your chair and under the table for quick exit. There are many restrooms spread out but small. The crew keeps the boat clean. We were able to see a cruise ship upon arriving to our destination. Our kids had a blast!",Travelers330
40,Smooth crossing,"Easy to deal with, and when I needed to change the booking, I called the main no. And was moved to another boat at no charge.",Paul B
50,"Fast, safe & fun !","We left Long Beach to Avalon in the ferry, the wind was very fresh, there was music, lost of people having a good time watching how we were approaching the island, I had my game boy with a brand new game, so the time went flying, very good staff!",Karim S

50,"Nice ride to the Island, but plan ahead","This is a fun, smooth trip to Catalina. You must reserve your spot ahead! The lines get long, so if you are with a group, plan ahead. We carried on our luggage on and put it in a special room near the entrance for those packing gear for snorkeling or staying over night. If your are on the upper deck you'll want sunscreen, a hat, and water. They do sell items on board. We saw sea life on our way out, and the clear day provided a beautiful view. There are spots to sit inside if you want to be out of the sun.",6Liddells
30,A Fine Ferry Ride,I took the ferry to Catalina Island and sat outside on the way there. The ferry was late when I was leaving from Catalina by a good 20 minutes and I had to get a Gray Line bus back in Long Beach at the terminal. The ferry service is fine and on the way back I sat inside and they offer drinks for sale. The ferry is basically clean and runs frequently. The only thing I noticed is they put the air conditioning on so cold and I heard several people asking for them to turn it down as they were cold and the crew just kind of shrugged it off and said there is nothing they can do about it. When most people feel it is too cold then I think Catalina Express should make their guests comfortable and have the air conditioning on at a level most people like.,Worldexplorer21
40,Good Service,Easy way to get from Long Beach to Catalina. The boat was clean and we sat outside. The rear rows outside get very exposed as you get out to sea so you will need warm clothes for these seats. There is plenty of indoor seating if you don't want to sit out though.,JoannaBrewer2016
30,Traveling with a Dog.,"On the way over crew was great. Found a comfortable place to sit with our dogs. Had them muzzled as required. Watch a man walking around with his dog with a EMD (emotional support dog). jacket which was probably bought on line. No muzzle, dog was pulling ahead not a trained dog. Another person walked by with the extend leashes, almost tripped someone as the dog was about 4 feet ahead of its human. On the way back, we pick seats that were in the back, because their was more foot space and the dogs would be out of the way. It was horrible, noisy, vibrating and the doors slamming with folks going in and out. I have an older dog that is use to traveling, she got frightened. I put a towel on the seat (I knew that she wasn't allowed) was calming her and giving her water. An employee told me to remove the dog from the seat (asked if could be in my lap and he said yes) I was letting my dog finishing drinking her water and he come on the other side, maybe a minute had passed and told me to hurry up and get the dog off the seat. He had just past a woman with two dogs with no muzzles, didn't say a word. Rules are 1 dog per person. Muzzles at all times. I know I ""broke the rules"" which I always follow. I needed to settle and comfort my dog which is also a certified therapy dog so she has certification. I understand the rules, it just bothered me the way it was handled and to pick and choose the rules. How was the woman allowed to get on the boat in the first place....then to top it off after getting off we exited to not through the building, but to the outside. The woman with the two dogs was behind us. Our dogs were doing their ""business"" she passed us and then released her dogs off-leash....amazing.",Truthteller1946
50,The crew is delightful,"Been riding Catalina Express since it first started with one small boat. Living on the Island having babies, raising children, sports, vacations, all of a growing families needs have been met with Catalina Express. They have supported Island Families in great times and in time that are difficult, example medical travel in wheel chairs, new babies, sick pet's and all that happens in life. The crew well some have been there since the beginning of Catalina Express, we have all grown together. If a company has life long employees they must be doing it right. They keep it safe, with in general great customer service.",Melinda S
40,The best way to get there!,"I usually always select the commodore lounge. Nothing like being inside, cocktail and snacks in hand while heading to the island. Especially good for for reluctant first timers.I've purchased the standard tickets and hated being out on deck when the wind was blowing and there was lots of mist. Commodore lounge offers me the option to check out the outer deck and return to my cozy seat.I wish there were better deals for the boat ride but they seem to be far and few.",Able
50,DayCation,Went on my complimentary birthday trip. My second time on a boat & don't have my sea legs but the terminal cafe sells sea sick pills for 1-2$. Didn't feel sick at all. The boat itself was clean. Plenty of room & breakfast snacks were great. We got to watch the sunrise (we left on the first ferry) and sunset on the express. Perfect way to end my birth DayTrip !,Tamar F
40,Combines cruising with practical transportation to and from Catalina.,Efficient transportation to Catalina. This was comfortable and easy to access either on-line or in person. Parking ramp is located right beside the office or you can park in the Queen Mary lot and use the shuttle to reach the Catalina Express.,72FrequentTraveler
50,You MUST go on your birthday!,"Most people know that Catalina Express will give you a free round-trip ticket if you depart on your birthday. (What? You didn't know? Well now you do.) So that's pretty cool in itself.When you get your ticket, you also get a little ""Happy Birthday"" ribbon which they encourage you to wear to get discounts and freebies. Ice cream! Coffee! 10% off lunch and dinner! It was magical.The best part is that employees, locals, and probably quite a few day-trippers like me, are all in on the program to wish you a happy birthday when you wear that silly ribbon. Complete strangers. All day long. And for that one day, the world seems like a smaller, friendlier place.Oh yeah, the boat ride was fast and smooth. We paid for the Commodore Lounge upgrade and enjoyed fast boarding, free drinks and snacks and extra comfy seats. We saw a few whales and dolphins along the way, which was a nice bonus.Why should you go to Catalina? Well, mostly to get away from the chaos of LA for a little while. But there are lots of things to do on the Island.Ziplines - super fun (after you get the nerve to step off the platform the first time).Ice Cream - get an Olaf, Big Olaf or Giant Olaf and feel like a kid again. Runners up: Lloyds (same flavors as Olaf's) and Descanso Beach Club (gotta try the Garibaldi!) and they also give you a freebie on your birthday.Dining - try the fantastical skirt steak at the Avalon Grille for dinner. lunch on the patio at the Descanso Beach Club was delightful for the food and the beachfront setting.Coffee - dang it, I can't remember the name of the coffee place where I got my birthday freebie. I had it on ice with a splash of milk and it was great.Tours - on a clear day, spend the big bucks for a helicopter tour of the island to see the pretty, secluded Pacific side and the rugged back country.Sights - rent an electric bike to zip up the hilly streets of Avalon to get up above to get an amazing view of the mainland, and enjoy the incredible quiet of a place with few cars and no freeways. - the Botanic Garden is peaceful, but not super interesting (it has lots of succulents and drought-tolerant plants from around the world) but the Wrigley Memorial is kind of cool to look at and is far enough to give you a nice walk.Hiking - tons of hiking trails, most with hills, some very steep. stop into the Catalina Island Conservancy for a trail map and they might tell you about some trails that aren't on the map, too. Garden to the Sky Trail takes you to a nice crest with a Pacific View.Other stuff that we didn't have time for: golf, jeep tours, spas, kayaking, boat tours, golf cart rentals.What not to do: shopping is kind of pricey and the ocean water is cold for swimming. But that's just me, because lots of people were enjoying both, even when we were there in February.",imbernj

Looked them up on the phone and called to see if I could catch a boat. I was just in time. Parking garage was directly across from the terminal. $37.50 each way for a ticket. Had enough time to get a bloody mary in the bar and got on the boat.Everyone seemed friendly enough. Sat on upper deck outside .... got extremely windy so moved under cover for last part of trip. Takes an hour to get to Catalina from Long Beach.*They do sell drinks on boat, but it is cash only.I got lucky in my timing.....seems as if they do keep their schedule so you must as well if you are planning ahead.

10,Left us on dock,Purchased tickets for 1215PM. Walked down ramp right at 1215PM due to parking issues. Several workers saw and heard us but continued to leave dock by untying ropes and lifting ramps. Then sat in basin for several minutes before continuing on their way to island. There was no reason to not allow us to board. Two of the workers came in terminal laughing about the incident. Kristen (supervisor) is totally lacking in customer service skills and did not understand how to diffuse a situation.,gatorgal11
40,Birthday Tour,I have never toured the island fully but I did two packages. One was the sub tour which was very fun. Shooting fish is so cool! The other was a jeep eco tour. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!

The restroom is clean. There's a charge to bring your bike, which we always do. The waiting line is always long, but they load you really fast. You can see the Queen Mary and a nice view of downtown long beach, dolphins, assorted fishes and birds on your way out.",soko y

I upgraded to VIP Commedore Lounge which includes priority boarding, complimentary snacks and adult beverages. I think it was worth it.

It is free round trip for anyone who travels on their birthday, which is awesome. The express is about $80 per person round trip, so you get to save a little cash on your special day. The ride took about 45-60 minutes, it was quick. If you sit on the top deck it is outside and you can see amazing views and also a lot of marine life. They have drinks and snacks on the boat but make sure you bring cash because I don't think they accept credit cards!!! I would definitely recommend the Catalina express and I will be using it again when I go back to Catalina. There are a few different ports it leaves from, we left from Long Beach but I think it also leaves from San Pedro and a couple other ports. Chow :)",Cassandraeleanor

Everyone, apparently The whole crew was really nice and they have a little concession stand were you could buy drinks and snacks. The only issue we had with this whole experience is that you have to get there very early (and hour to an hour and a half) if you want to sit together.

50,Fast and Friendly,"I was struck by how efficiently the Catalina Express runs, getting folks (and their luggage!) on and off very effectively. Follow their directions and they will get you embarked and disembarked quickly. The crew seemed quite friendly, both on the trip there and back. We sprung for the extra $15 for the Commodore Lounge, and being high up gave us great views. Seats are comfortable. You get a free drink with the upgrade, and a cookie or small bag of snack mix. I had a glass of cabernet on the way out to the island, but just did coffee on the way back. Smooth water on the way out got us there in just under 50 minutes. Coming back, we had fog, so were a bit over an hour, but I side with caution in fog--there is a lot of shipping in these waters. The ferry seems well kept up.",Jilara
50,Super Way to Get to Catalina - Catalina Express,"We have had a great time taking the Catalina Express from Long Beach. The ride if the Pacific Ocean is smooth is delightful. The staff is good.

There are places for dining and shopping.",mini
40,Decent travel to Catalina,"During my most recent trip to Catalina for a Budlight Takes Over Catalina event, I had the opportunity to sit in their general seating at 730AM and my return trip was in their first class, also called the commodore lounge at 630PM.The lines move quickly, as long as passengers had their information ready. They were prompt in getting us on the boat, though late on the take off for both my departure and arrival. My morning trip was super early so there weren't many people on board. We sat in the main level and there was definitely a musky smell that wafted around the area. Thankfully, it wasn't crowded so I was able to position myself as needed.Now my return trip, initially I was set up for general seating but when I saw that the line was like a Disneyland ride due to all the Budlight party people shipping home, my hubby upgraded me to their first class because the line was honestly that much shorter, plus the seating would be optimal. It was an extra $15 so it wasn't that much more of a cost to avoid that line and sit more comfortably.The commodore lounge was certainly an upgrade, plus the door opened into open air so you got some of that breeze come through. The seats were roomy and you were provided a drink ticket too.Here's a tip, on your return trip, especially if you're traveling toward dusk, sit yourself on the right side of the room so the sun isn't beaming down on you the whole ride home.",Rho K
50,Great way to travel to Catalina Island,We enjoyed our trip to Catalina Island aboard the Catalina Express. they offered beverages to buy and the ride was pleasant for the 30 minutes or so of traveling to the Island.,Charles C
40,The Full Catalina Experience,"The best way to get to Catalina is the Catalina Express from the Long Beach terminal at Golden Shores. There is plenty of parking in the lot adjacent to the terminal, and the terminal is well laid out and has heaps of useful information on Catalina. The boarding is well managed. Make sure that you line up in the correct lane - Commodore club to the right, other to the left. Maybe take some shade, as the California sun can get to you while in the line.Tip - invest the extra to go Commodore Club, it is well worth the money, and very relaxing.On the way out to Catalina, keep your eyes open, as seals and dolphins are regular companions on the way. Don't moss the garabaldis at the dock in Catalina. The State fish of California.",OziDiver

It was nice to have an indoor seat and snacks (though I would rate the ""snack"" pretty chintzy) and a free drink. Was it worth the additional $30 per person RT? Debatable! But we did get a nice seat in a row of two seats right at the window and it was quiet and warm. The snack was a tiny pack of trail mix or a cookie. The drink for me was a Bloody mary which was pretty good and a diet coke for my husband. The ride over and back was nice and calm and pretty quiet inside. I'm not sure what it would have been outside, so can't offer a comparasion in general boarding.",patspetpalace

One of the best I have seen. The view we had was awesone!!! Now, I would share where we were, but I plan on returning to that same location again next year and there is no other place like it and space is very limited there. In all, a good July 4th get away.",ALICIA C F

40,Great way to get out on the water and see Catalina!,"Well organized and maintained fleet. You are not packed in like sardines so you can enjoy the sights and the gorgeous views.We left form San Pedro on time and arrived on the dot. The views leaving the harbor in Long Beach are interesting and will keep you busy checking out this working harbor.Lots of seals and dolphins along the way, and approaching Catalina is always a lovely sight.Coming home was just as efficient and on time. Sunset was brilliant so overall I highly recommend the day out with the added bonus of wandering the Avalon scene for shopping and good eats!",JinniJenkins

50,Travel to Catalina Island,"The Catalina Express is the best way to the island. 1 hour from Long Beach is all it takes. It's a nice day trip if you've never been there. I recommend 9am to 4pm. You can take in a short tour, have lunch, walk the beach front and do a little shopping.",elcyd56
40,Treat Yourself to the Birthday Special,"It happened! I was finally able to take advantage of the Catalina Express ""Travel Free On Your Birthday"" Promotion. I had been waiting to take advantage of this offer for two years. Like most people, I work during the week. Thankfully this year, birthday finally fell on a Saturday. I opted to leave out of Long Beach instead of San Pedro because it offered a later return. I was able to take the 8:30am departure, returning at 7:30pm. Make sure you reserve your space early enough so that you have more options, especially if you have a summer birthday. Since you don't have to pay for travel, the offer is for general seating in the main cabin, I highly recommend that you upgrade to the Commodore Lounge. The upgrade charge is currently $15 each way and well worth it. First, you get priority check-in and boarding. The Lounge accommodates a limited number of guests so you don't have to deal with the massive number of people in general seating. Second, you have the luxury of reclining, leather trimmed seats, similar to those on an airplane. Also included with your upgrade, all guests in the Commodore Lounge receive a beverage (options offered) and snack and/or cookie. Be careful in making your selection, don't choose anything too sugary that might upset your stomach in case the waters get a little choppy. You can also decide to save your snack for later, after you arrive on the island...an even better idea. The service on the vessel was better than I anticipated, but then again, it's one of the perks for upgrading.The crew was very attentive and accommodating in evey way. They were especially helpful to those who needed assistance with bouts of sea sickness. Kudos to the attendants! Finally, once the vessel arrives at the port, I opted for Avalon, passengers in the Commodore Lounge have an easy exit.The excursion took a little over an hour and was very enjoyable. Upon arrival to Catalina, it's nice to make your way around to all of the various shops, restaurants and activity centers that offer free gifts, discounts, etc. for those celebrating a birthday(you are provided with a list of the participating vendors when you check-in at the Catalina Express counter). As you make your way around, it's so much fun to connect with other people who are also visiting the island to celebrate their birthday on your birthday. You'll know who they are by the proudly displayed birthday ribbon given to the special day passengers at CE check in.Also, don't be affraid to go alone. Remember, as the birthday person, it's not expensive, but for friends and family joining you, it's full price for everything! Also, I highly recommend taking the interior island tour. There are several companies that offer this experience. It's a great way to see parts of the island that you won't get to see otherwise. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my birthday celebration by doing what I wanted. It was a very full day and quite memorable. I can now check that off my busket list.",sharon b

50,Smooth sailing!,"Neither my girlfriend nor I had ever been to Catalina so this was our first time on the Catalina Express. I used a AAA coupon to save a few dollars so that was a great start. We arrived in Long Beach and were immediately impressed by how clean the facility was and by the fact we were only in line for a few minutes. Once boarding started, it went quickly and smoothly. My gf had been concerned all morning about possibly getting nauseous or seasick since she tends to get so on boats. But much to our enjoyment, she was fine. The ride was smooth (water was only slightly choppy - great weather) and relaxing - we sat outside on the top deck on the return trip and loved the panoramic view from up high.

We did purchase tickets in the Commodore's lounge which has better seating, inside and air conditioned. We also went out to the other decks. I thought the top deck was too windy and loud. The bottom back deck was very nice and so we spent part of our time there and part of our time inside. It was a great value. The trip from Long Beach to Avalon was about 1 hour. Your luggage is covered and dry while in transport. The Long Beach Terminal has a large covered parking garage and it seems like they have employees in the garage all the time. The price was $15 per day to park but then we didn't have to worry about our vehicle while we were gone.",Ann C
50,Scenic and Fun but pricey,"The Catalina Express leaves several times daily to Catalina Island. This was my first ride and visit to the island. Other than helicopter or personal boat, this is the way to get there so the prices are a little high. There is also an upgraded section which gives you priority boarding and a drink and what they call ""a snack"", which is kind of lame (a cookie or 1 ounce of a snack mix). On an usually hot day, though, it was very nice to board early and go right into air conditioning. The staff in this commodore lounge were very friendly. This year on your birthday, you can ride roundtrip free...so plan wisely and save your family some money.",sarahcuse

Leaving the port you will get a great view of the queen Mary.

I am not unusually vulnerable to seasickness but this unavoidable rocking was bothering me. I went to the open back end of the boat and felt better in the fresh air.

50,"Prompt departures, helpful staff, pet-friendly","Catalina Express is the best way to get to Avalon, and really the ONLY way if you're traveling with pets. They allow dogs as long as they are muzzled or in proper pet carriers.Reservation process was easy though via phone it was a long wait to speak to an agent. Port of Long Beach offers the most departures/arrivals.They are quite generous with their baggage allowances, as far as size and weight of bags, allowing you to bring quite a bit of luggage with you. Locals from Avalon stocking up on supplies in Long Beach bring their Costco purchases back home via the boat as we noticed a good number of bulk dry goods and grocery boxes stacked up with the other luggage.We followed all of their baggage restrictions, though when trying to reserve space for and pay extra for adventure gear we were carrying they did not allow us to pay anything extra. In addition to each of us having a carry-on, a suitcase, and a (carry-on) dog carrier we each also had an inflatable kayak in a pack below the size limits but close to weight limit of 50 lbs., plus a pair of oars. The oars, broken in half, met the requirement of less than 4 feet in height, though on one phone call a reservationist mistakenly told me ""no oars allowed"", contradicting what I'd been told earlier, before checking with her supervisor. Anyway, we were very worried about our gear and the limits of what could be carried on for our three night stay in Avalon, but in the end no one gave us any kind of hard time at all.Great ocean views of the 26 miles to Catalina Island. Nice cool ocean breezes. On the way out we had a catamaran and on the return to Long Beach a regular single-hulled ship. Both offered a timely and orderly boarding processes. The catamaran was self-serve as far as carrying baggage on, where it was stowed at the back of the main floor of the ship, and retrieved by passengers as they exited. On the return trip, on the smaller boat, gear was given to crew members as we approached the boat entrance and stowed in the bottom of the boat, out of view. At Long Beach we had to wait for them to retrieve it to the deck.(Sorry for all of this info on baggage, but it was a concern of ours and I wished someone had shared more info about it with me to ease my worries before we left).Beverage service is available on board. To avoid sea-sickness, if that's a problem for you like it is for my husband, it's advised to sit on the top deck of the catamaran, or the middle indoor floor of the single-hulled boat. Back deck of the catamaran was a bit shady, which was nice when we were standing still in the midday sun but actually got chilly at 26mph. Also kinda dizzy with exhaust smell there.I would recommend the Catalina Express to anyone heading to Catalina Island. It was a fun trip, and the staff is efficient, safety-conscious, friendly and well-organized.",GhiaGirl

50,Even a last minute trip is possible - you just might need to pay more! So much fun!,"We made a last minute decision to go to Catalina for the day. Upon arriving in Long Beach, we had no trouble following the signs to Catalina Express and their big parking structure ( fee ). We found a space and followed the arrows to the office for Catalina Express. We hadn't made any reservations but the agent helped us to see various options. We chose to take the Commodore Class which provides early boarding and bigger seats as well as a free drink and snack. One of my kids gets sea sick so we were a little apprehensive.We boarded and found seats together. The ride over was as smooth as could be. The staff were attentive and quick at bringing everyone a choice of morning beverage. The kids all felt fine - even going outside a little to enjoy the wind and spray. Mind you, the folks sitting outside seemed a little cold, even on a hot summer's day - so if you get the cheaper seats, be sure to bring a sweater or jacket.The return was equally easy - we arrived and stood in the line for Commodore seating which allowed us to board first (well, actually after some disabled folks). We managed to get a big table by the window and enjoyed watching the sunset over the Pacific as we returned to Long Beach. It was a great day and Catalina Express makes it so easy!",Marian M

We upgraded to the Commodore lounge so we could get a snack, drink (alcohol included) and priority boarding. The staff were pleasant and friendly. The Commodore lounge was air-conditioned and the seats were comfy. Staff were pleasant and friendly. We didn't have any luggage but there was a room to one side when you boarded where luggage could be stored for the trip. It was an hour long trip which was relaxing after a full day on the island. Embarking and disembarking was smooth and went fairly well considering the amount of people the boat can carry. My recommendation would be to have more benches and a covered area for shade when waiting to board the boat (gate 1 area).",DinaMBS
30,Best Deal/No Competition,"This mode of transportation surely beats paying the big bucks for a helicopter ride or hiring a private sailboat or renting jet skis for the 22 miles crossing. However, you get stung and stung again. The parking at Long Beach is pricey. San Pedro is $16 for a day. The round trip tickets for an adult are over $70.00 per person and for a mere $15.00 extra you can seat in the Commodore Lounge-- that means inside, upstairs, a free soft drink and some deferential stewards. Not really worth it unless the boat is VERY crowded or the seas VERY choppy. Then you want to be away from the folks barfing all around you. Since Catalina Express has essentially ousted any competition, you can't get from the mainland to the island any cheaper or more conveniently. They have had the edge on speed and convenience, but for a family to vacation on the island, other cheaper, slower modes of marine transportation were a positive alternative.",rdyoung68
30,Nothing special,The boarding and disembarking went smoothly and the boat itself was pretty nice. Other than that it was not that good.The food at the Long Beach terminal was expensive and the brioche bun tasted like a dinner roll.

Not sure there are other options depending on where you're traveling from.,TXVacationers
50,Wonderful Trip Experience,"Family bought Commodore VIP tickets to Avalon and WOW was i worth it. Great views, great service, and great VIP experience. We all got a free snack and a free beverage.",Kat R
50,Day Trip,"Had been awhile since I had been there. The Catalina Express is very reasonable & the staff are very friendly. The bloody Mary's are the best!! The chairs were very comfortable & the ride over was very nice & seemed to go by very fast. I love Catalina Island. I rented a motorized bike & tootled around the island. I hung out at the beach & went shopping. I had a wonderful, perfect day!!",schrammck
50,So much fun,Actually this was birthday grandma with pre teen granddaughters. .we were scheduled to go out on the 8 30am boat but since we were early they asked us if we would like to go on the 7 30 boat. And we did..Boat was clean and so were the bathrooms..The crew were very nice..no complaints at all..,sandymccluskey1953
50,Birthday Sailin',"My husband booked us a trip to Catalina Island for 2 days. I travelled round trip free since we went on my birthday. We upgraded to the Commodore Lounge for $15 more each, each way. It was worth it. The boat ride was so comfortable & enjoyable. We had a great time.",Debra E
50,Mary,Commodore lounge was worth the extra... Comfortable seating and less of a line to board. We took the 7:30 back so we could watch the sunset. Beautiful!,maryhmLongIsland_NY
40,Express Cat is the best!,We booked a trip on the Catalina Express. Our boat to the island was the Express and the return trip was on the Express Cat. I prefer the Express Cat over the Express. The ride seemed smoother. We were even treated to a whale sighting. We boarded in San Pedro.,Troy M
30,An hour long ride,I booked this transportation source since it was more price convenient. I was traveling with 3 year old and 8 year old and their grandparents. Since we got there somewhat later we all had to seat in different places of the ship. Everyone was nice but if your traveling with small children I recommend the helicopter ride which is faster. The stop at Avalon was ok. There's a help desk that's pretty friendly.,D M
20,cold,The ferry left on time my only issue was that they had the ac on full blast at like 10pm when it was already 50 degrees outside!,em74365
50,"Easy, Well Run, Highly Recommend Commodore Lounge","Took the Catalina Express back and forth to Avalon for our family vacation. Check in was quick and easy (we purchased the Commodores Lounge, which help the line). I suggest if you have more than a few bags to drop them off at the terminal then go park in the garage. Not a far distance but the elevator was slow and their are some steps. Parking is VERY expensive, for 8 days it was over $150. Not anyone fault it is what it is just be aware. Waiting area was fine, clean, had some food and drinks available for purchase. With the Commodores Lounge you board first in a shorter line where they lead you to the upstairs lounge with snacks (cookie and trail mix) an indoor seat, private bathroom, air conditioning and a bar. Nice smooth ride both ways. Just wish they helped get your bags on. I saw the other company and it was night and day with the Catalina Express.",MattyD1329
50,Day Getaway,The boat left on time and returned on time. The ride was smooth and comfortable on the commodore level. The staff were friendly and helpful during our trip.,JRR132
10,"Sorry, needs beter employee training","What was to be a simple July 7, 11:45 AM trip over to Long Beach from Avalon with the infamous commodore lounge ""upgrade"", gone totally wrong.It was more than a little weird when the staff person flatly insisted that we show our ""beverage vouchers"" in order to obtain access to the commodore lounge level that we had paid for. Interestingly enough, we had ticket stubs in each of our hands that said ""Commodore Lounge"". ""No, to gain access to this lounge, you must have your beverage vouchers."" What?But we don't want a beverage, here is our ticket to the commodore lounge. ""That's only the dock ticket"", she says.It just became a silly mess with her ending up being really rude and it becoming a big scene. And us having to stop and drop our carry ons and dig through it all to find these ""beverage vouchers"" that we didn't really want to use anyway.If I have an issued ticket that says ""Commodore Lounge"" and it also has my name on it, it also has the date on it, and it also has the exact time on it, should that not be enough to be able sit down? No way sir. You're not going in here without your beverage vouchers.Maybe just a little better training for employees is in order. As for me, I would never ever use this service again. A $15 upgrade that became nothing more than just a big hassle to use.Believe it or not, I rarely choose to pay for the upgrade to painful experiences.",TravelToTheAirport
40,"If you are a local, save up and do this.","There are several Catalina Express locations. I used the one in Long Beach. If you're staying overnight here is a car lot to park in, get there early so you can get good Peking and relax while waiting to depart; you'll want to be among the first on the ship to get seating together if you are traveling with others, and you'll want to get the seats you prefer. There are also a few discount ticket sellers for Catalina Express like Recreation Connection. Take advantage of the discount if you can. The time you'll save on this boat is worth it. There are restrooms and a small snack bar on board. Enjoy!",Seashellstew

50,What could be better?!,"Going to Catalina is the best time to be had as it is and when you get to go swiftly on the Express AND for free it's a double bonus! Don't forget to sign up for your free birthday trip on the Express. Put on your sunscreen and spend the day on ""the island""!",Lynda V
50,Ferry to Avalon,"Took the Catalina Express from Long Beach to Avalon for an afternoon. Ferry was clean, comfortable, fast. Crew was very friendly.",jbsunapee
50,MUCH better than the Flyer!,"I've had several experiences with Catalina Express through Long Beach, and they have all been speedy, efficient, reasonably priced, and organized. Sometimes the boat is a little behind schedule by a few minutes, but often that's due to people arriving late (I was one of those people one time and was grateful we didn't miss the boat!). It takes about an hour (give or take 10 minutes), the staff are all really friendly, they even come around and ask if you would like any food or drink (not for free though). They are really efficient at getting people and their luggage on and off the boat, and have cabinets to store luggage securely.I want to emphasize that Express is hands down the way to go to get to Avalon. I have traveled via Catalina Flyer twice and they were the two most miserable times of my life. The Flyer is disturbingly disorganized, unfriendly, slow, dirty, crowded, and inconvenient. Definitely take the Express, especially out of Long Beach. My only tip is to take a taxi because parking is around $10 a day!",TheMarySpoon
40,Easy way to get to the island and back from Long Beach,Not too many options to get to the island and back but this company sure does it's best for you.

50,Catalina Express/Catalina Island,"the Catalina Express is a quick and luxurious way to travel to Catalina Island. it takes about 1 hour and there drinks and food available. It is inexspensive;about $52 for two people with coupon. you can find the coupon In the Downtown Gazette paper, which you will find on every corner or store front. It's free. Once you get to the island, there so much to see and do. I would definately plan on spending at least one overnight. There is the beach, museums, snorkeling, golf cart & bike rentals, great shopping, affordable hotels and trips to the other lush rural part of the Island. It will be fun for the entire family, a romantic getaway or a relaxing time by yourself to recharge! Everyone leaves with a smile!",Melanie K
50,The Best Way To Get To Catalina!,"I have been traveling to Catalina Island for the better part of the last 30 years. Catalina Express is absolutely the best way to get to the island for the best price. The catamarans that they use to take you to the island provide a smooth journey. I also highly recommend if you can afford it, to upgrade to the commodore's lounge. The commodore's lounge is sort of first class travel to the island. It enables you to board earlier than the rest of the passengers, and you get a free beverage with your upgraded ticket. Also, since you're on the second floor of the boat you have a much better view for a greater distance than you do from the bottom level of the boat. There is also a private balcony behind the lounge that is a wonderful viewing deck. The staff is always courteous, friendly, and helpful! If you are visiting Southern California and you want to visit Catalina Island take The Catalina Express and treat yourself to the commodore's lounge!",rodvilencia

30,"Friendly, Helpful staff.","I spent a few hours at the Catalina Express waiting for the Boy Scouts. The staff is very friendly. The snack bar is not really a snack bar but a FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT! (Where I ate both breakfast and lunch) The food was much better than I thoguht it would be and very reasonably priced. The BLT I had for lunch was made to order, grilled sourdough, and (complaint) had the smallest slice of tomato I have ever seen, but it was still very good. Outside seating is the best. One fo the best testaments to the food however was watching the Fire Boat and Police Boat pull up for lunch too, out of all the restaurants on the wharf, they chose here.",creeker000
50,What a fantastic time,"I love being on the water and I had never been to Catalina. In the off-season, I got a great rate on a hotel. Took the island tour and enjoyed several restaurants. I can't wait to go back!",DebbieHatch

50,Birthday ferry ride,"I somehow came across information that your ride to and from Catalina Island is free on your birthday! Booking process online was easy. All you do when you show up at the dock is to go to an agent, give them your printed information, show an ID, and your free trip begins! They give you a birthday ribbon to wear and printed info on freebies and discounts on Catalina. Nice ride to Catalina with seating inside and outside, about 60-65 minutes from Long Beach.

50,Nice Comfortable Ferry,I liked it. Being that it's one of the only ways to get to the island. The Ferry was comfortable and the staff was very accommodating and friendly. It was also very organized.,bzytraveler63
50,"Fast, efficient, on time. Brilliant.","We had never been to Catalina Island (we are from New Zealand) and heard of the Birthday deal where you travel free if you pre register. This was the catalyst for us to finally take the trip as it was my wife's birthday while we were in LA visiting our son.Pre registering on line line was very straightforward, and we printed the birthday pass as instructed.I found that I could not book the actual tickets on line because of the Birthday Pass, but it was actually quite nice talking to a real person on the telephone. The customer service gentleman was pleasant and very helpful, and the ticket was booked (credit card details had to be provided to hold the ticket, but was not charged until we checked in). An e mail confirmation was promptly sent, and we printed out the actual ticket. A Seniors ticket was $68 return including taxes.The parking building was easy to find, it cost $15 for the day, and it is only a short walk to the terminal.Check in was a breeze. We had a coffee in the cafe, then lined up, boarded and had a pleasant 1 hour cruise to Catalina Island.We sat on the very top deck which was comfortable, and most enjoyable - great views.It was a really great day trip going to the quaint Avalon village, and the return trip with Catalina Express added positively to the experience.",Steve A
50,Best Bloody Mary,Get a bloody mary ask for extra beans..Thats all I have to say.I will go back to Avalon just to drink these.,Mariodidit
50,A Great Escape,"Weather permitting, the Catalina Express runs on time and provides a quick escape from the bustle of the LA Basin to beautiful Avalon. If vacationing, the best tip for adults is a bloody mary, which provides a bit of spice prior to landing on Catalina. Most of the boats provide comfortable seating inside and out.If seasickness is a problem, it is best to sit on the lower deck in center seats, more than halfway to the stern. If outside seating is a priority, be sure to have plenty of outerwear even on a warm day, as the speed of the craft can lower the outside deck temperatures.",Joe C

Take the shuttle in the center of town to the restaurant where there is free food. Take the shuttle all the way around out to the Gardens. See the Casino Tour which is excellent! Enjoy your ice cream and then get in line for the Catalina Express back home. Take turns waiting in line and go see the restaurant that has peanut shells on the floor. If you have more time, spend the night and go see the interior of the island, zip line, scuba, snorkel, rent a golf cart, shop....great adventure!",powersusa

50,The best way to go to Catalina,"The Catalina Express is the least expensive and fastest way to get to Catalina. I definitely have to give it an excellent rating. To my surprise the Catalina Express was fast and smooth, sailing over the waves. Definitely no motion. They have a nice snack and bar area with good offerings. Coming back to Long Beach is a very orderly process, where you arrive to the nice parking lot, which seems somewhat secure for the port area.In the 1980's I went on a slow boat over to the island from Long Beach and not only way it long, but it was so rocky with every wave and swell...all the people were sick or throwing up until we arrived in Avalon Bay. It was so bad I took a helicopter back to Long Beach to avoid the misery.",Sally F
50,Great day trip or overnight adventure,I most recently went over there on my Bday and you get a free RT ticket. Also once on the island there are all kinds of free stuff for. It is like a little European island Island only a hour from Long Beach.,scubarews
50,Cruising to Catalina,"I've been going to Catalina since the 50's and I still find the whole experience enchanting. I miss the old white steamer with the mariachi band and the mina bird and the kids diving for coins. The express boats ride very smooth and a also very convenient and quick. The way to go is the ""Commodore Lounge"". It's a little more costly but well worth it. You go on first and you are guaranteed a seat indoors upstairs. I love it when the dolphins come calling on the wake of the boats! The staff is very professional and firm. They could be a little friendlier. They make a lasting impression to the many people on their first and for some, their only trip to the beautiful Santa Catalina Island and the city of Avalon.",LAHLB
40,"Park elsewhere, bring your bike!","Parking is expensive so park on a side street in Long Beach and take the bus or an uber in.Bring your bike! It's only $5 to take it over to Catalina and makes it much easier and more fun to get around the island.Sometimes you can spot Dolphins from the boat so sit outside or at least keep an eye on the water.If you get sea sick, do take medication before the ride.There's a bar with snacks on board so we always enjoy a cocktail on the way over.Enjoy!",NickyLabo

50,Smooth sailing to a breathtaking get away 4/24/2015,"The Catalina Express organization runs a tight ship. We arrived 30 minutes early at the Long Beach location, as suggested. We found parking to be a breeze, however, it does cost $15.00(USD) per day. That's not bad considering, your car is steps away from the boats. You will have to walk some but the distance is not bad at all. The structure is well lit and marked so that you don't have to worry about not finding your car.The ticket counter check in is both efficient and organized. We handed our printed out confirmation and the tickets were presented to us. It was Bobby's birthday and he traveled for free (they even let us come back the next day and his ticket was still free). Once we had our tickets, we went to the dock and waited. It does get cold early in the morning and you might want to bring a jacket.Once on board, we found seating to be both comfortable and easy to find. If you want the fresh air, you can sit up on the top floors and enjoy the ocean air. We opted for the top outside location for the trip to Catalina and inside for the return. They have a food station inside with some spirits and mixed drinks. I suggest the Bloody Mary for $5.00 and some pretzels to snack on.The boats are well maintained and they do pay attention to weather conditions. Our trip to Catalina was extremely smooth as the ocean was behaving. Our return trip was mildly bumpy because of a storm that had occurred, so make sure you pay attention to the captain of the boat. They will tell you if you need to sit because of upcoming waves.Great adventure and we are extremely happy with the service at both landings and on the ocean. I highly recommend it for all ages. If you get sea sick, remember to bring saltines or grab some pretzels to munch on.This adventure is well worth it!",SherriO’Gorman
50,Ride in Comfort,"We booked the ride to Catalina Island through the concierge at the Queen Mary. There is a free shuttle that leaves from the Queen Mary parking lot and drops you off a couple of blocks from the Catalina Express dock. Ask the driver to point out the route from the bus stop to the dock, it is hidden behind some tall buildings.The tickets are timed so you will need to plan your departure to and from the the island in advance. There is a charge to change your trip time. The boats are comfortable and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful.We spotted a large school of bottle nose dolphins as we approached the island. The boat captain slowed and altered course so that everyone on the boat got a good view. It was an unexpected extra treat.",Mike H

40,Catalina Express,We traveled for a day to the island of Catalina from Long Beach on this service which we were able to get only by going into the office in person after all the online spaces were seemingly booked up. That said the service was good in that the boats are very new and fast and comfortable if you can get a seat that is. It seems the company are too keen on getting the Commodore class ticket holders on first and then leaving the general ticket holders until about 5 minutes before departure so in reality this never happens and the boats are generally 10 minutes late due to slow boarding. We were annoyed that the boat's seating was already taken by the commodore class travelers before we got a chance to get on board and therefore were resigned to the outside and the rain and cold wind which was prevalent that day. The food offer on board was very limited and expensive so we were less than impressed by that side of things. However we were able to get a ticket on the day which in itself was very reasonable for the trip to and from the island.,neilmorris75
40,Happy Birthday!,"Catalina Express makes it easy to celebrate your birthday on one of the area's true gems, Catalina Island: they offer free passage to and from the Island with proof of your date of birth. This year my birthday fell on a Saturday and I jumped at the chance to accept their offer. I chose to leave from Long Beach, where there is ample parking (for a fee), a coffee shop and a comfortable waiting area with tons of literature on the island and a counter for purchasing tours in advance. I was given a birthday ribbon and a list of merchants who offer discounts or special gifts to the birthday travelers. The vessel is modern and comfortable and the trip was smooth. I met a couple of other birthday folk on the island, shared a discounted tour of the island interior with one birthday girl and her family and took advantage of a free hamburger with a delightful birthday guy from my home state. The fellow Texan told me about the free ice cream cone! So, I went alone and came back with some new friends. I hope the company keeps this promotion going - I want to go again next year!",lirocapoce
40,Transportation to Catalina Island,"Overall I was satisfied with the ferry service. Make sure you keep your tickets in a safe place, if you lose your returning ticket, you have to pay the fare again. Make sure to book your trip in advance, as prime times sell out. I made the mistake of waiting until two days before and the 10am trip from Long Beach was sold out. We were able to book the 8:30 am instead. The cabin was a bit chilly, so bring a light jacket or sweater. On the way back from Catalina, we saw a baby whale playing in the wake of the boat, so the captain stopped the boat so all the passengers could have a chance to see. It became an impromptu whale-watching trip, which was neat. I thought it was very kind of them to stop so we could all enjoy the sight. It was a smooth ride for a catamaran.",trav521el

But good for a one-time vacation stop...",leoclab

The staff were pleasant, the boat was clean and the ride was very smooth. We were given good instructions, offered help in finding attractions and given a specific time to be back and sail across back to Long Beach. Parking was a breeze at the Long Beach port and only $15 for the day. Avalon was a 5 minute walk from where the boat landed, so it was a completely easygoing experience.",224CarlosC
50,"The best way to get to the island, especialy on your birthday","I am not a person to get excited about my birthday all that much, but it's till fun to do something. Catalina Express every year offers free round trip passage on your birthday, You just must begin and depart on your actual birthday, you have thirty days to return. It's roughly an $80 trip for free. I depart and return from right here in Long Beach where I live but they also go from San Pedro and Dana Point. I just go to Avalon, but you can also go to Twin Harbor. I actually decided to stay for two nights at the Hotel Mac Rae. I'll review that hotel after I've been there. There are several departure times and you can bring two pieces of luggage on board as long as they measure out to 23"" x 23"" x 37"", plus you can bring on a carry-on, i.e. camera bag, laptop. That's a better policy than most airlines I can think of. And I'm just going for an extended two days, not a business or leisure trip or a week or so to some foreign city. Here from the LA area it's just about 28 miles to Avalon and my hotel is right on the beach. Just going for a relaxing visit though I will probably be caught up in the excursions and especially the zip-line and what ever seems 'cool'. For us in SoCal, Catalina is just a weekend getaway, so no big deal to do it all, we can always come back again. I'm writing this based on previous travel with them, but they do an excellent job of taking care of you. It's all in the USA and in Los Angeles Country so no need for passports, other than photo ID if you're traveling in your birthday. And the merchants and tour operators also honor and give discounts for birthday travelers. I am going this time by myself, but they also honor guests of b-day guests with the same discounts. All the way from drinks, meals, parasailing, helicopter tours, the already mentioned zipline, and scenic cruises. And Catalina Express and their partners can make this all happen. Or hell, just go there for the day, relax on the beach and come home. It's like a Mediterranean vacation without really leaving home.",James L
50,The way to go to Catalina,"Ferry service from 3 ports. We left from Long Beach which seemed to have the better schedule. Very modern facility in downtown Long Beach. Exit Golden Shore from Long Beach downtown exit. You will circle the parking structure; do not park in Catalina Landing, that's the office building. Keep circling the parking structure to find the entrance to Catalina Express. Short walk into terminal.Short wait to get tickets. We had a slight problem because we were buying tickets for others who were taking a later ferry. Phone rep gave completely different info than clerks at terminal.Seats are very comfortable. They offer an upgrade for $15 each way which includes a drink and snacks. In coach there is food service, about what is to be expected.1 hour crossing. Very smooth. Outdoor seating available.Ferry terminal is at far South end of Avalon. 30 minute walk to zip line, and then you will have walked the whole waterfront.",SoCalTraveler91356
40,Great Way to Get to Catalina,"This is a high speed ferry service to Catalina. We left from Long Beach. It's been at east thirty years since my last trip. The terminal appeared to be in the middle of an office building. You can unload your baggage there and walk it in - hopefully there are at least two of you so one can stay with the luggage as there are no porters or help. You can park across the street in a large multi story parking garage.There are many steps up to the terminal building. There is a long handicapped ramp you can use to wheel your bags up.You are not able to check your luggage as you are responsible for getting it on the ferry. I bought our tickets ahead of time and upgraded them one level. I asked about how accessible it was - the reservation person said it was an easy few steps up. It turned out to be twenty or so steps which was a lot for me to handle. So we didn't upgrade coming back. The crew did help me with my bag getting on and I pre boarded. But it was a steep grade on the ramp going and very steep coming back. I asked for help at the ticket booth coming back and was told ""they should help you"" which they did - but I worried none the less.The ride both ways was comfortable and scenic. We saw Dolphins in Avalon when we arrived and saw a whale on the way back.Other than the boarding/luggage issue, it was fun.",Bensus
50,Great way to get to Catalina,"We got to the terminal early before our departure, and got excellent window seats inside. On the way back, I think we were the last or next to last departure, so the line to board was long, and we ended up on the back of the boat, upstairs (outside). Even in the summer heat, it was pretty cool up there since the boat whips up quite a bit of water, and you might get damp, so if you want to stay dry, board early and sit inside.All in all, it was a great experience. You can buy drinks and snacks on board, and there is a restroom. I preferred sitting inside. It's quieter, and you can look out and maybe see dolphins or sea lions. We saw sea lions on the way to Catalina, and lots of dolphins on the way back. The boat was on time both ways, and it's a very smooth ride.",erin844
40,Getting to Catalina,"It would be great if it were cheaper to get to Catalina, but a 75 minute ferry ride is going to cost something. The Catalina Express is fast and convenient. The seats and views are just fine.",KathrynLHall

50,Catalina Express really makes it easy!,"Waited until last minute to make reservations so didn't get times I wanted but agent suggested I could go to the terminal and maybe there would be last minute availability. The terminal agent was very helpful, ended up saving 100$ and getting the exact times I wanted. Boats are clean and well maintained and the crew keeps you safe but let's you just relax and enjoy the beautiful trip. In this case, while we were waiting in line to board one of the passengers felt faint and started to fall. One of the crew grabbed him and held him until a wheelchair could be secured. The crew took excellent care of the man and didn't let the little mishap spoil his weekend with grandkids(his blood sugar was a little low). It's a very reliable and cost effective service to access a little island time!",Mark Z
40,"Nice boat terminal,","I purchase my tickets to Catalina over the phone and the girl was very helpful. I was able to picked the time that i wanted and sign up for the birthday passes for my son.

They have a little snack shop there, with sandwiches and drinks. Over all it was an enjoyable experience!",Lindsey B

10,Getting there - how NOT to make your ferry!!,"This review is about Prime Time airport shuttle that caused us to miss our ferry ride at 2pm January 29th. NEVER EVER use this shuttle. Their incompetence is a direct rip off!At LAX we had a 12:15pm reservation with Prime Time to get us to the Catalina Express in Long Beach for a 2 pm ferry departure to Catalina.They arrived 30 minutes late.. the excuse for this, ""it takes 30 minutes to drive around the airport!"" was a direct lie - I've lived in LA for a dozen years and know that airport; that lie is something cooked up out of habit is my guess. And if they believed it, it would be irrelevant; their job is to deal with how to get around the airport that is the hub of their business.After picking us up late, the driver ran to pick up another person at LAX to be dropped off at Redondo Beach (sort of one the way, but not a good route). The driver didn't heed our complaints about this plan - nor could he converse very well in his very bad English.It's 26 miles from LAX to Catalina Express, or 40 minutes. In nearly 2 hours, this driver managed to make us miss our 2pm ferry.Note - the ferry service loads passengers until 5minutes before departure, then shuts off access.3 hours till the next one.Thanks PrimeTime, you incompetent jerks!",Anne B

50,Fast and comfortable,"I am prone to sea sickness on small vessels. No issues with this boat, the ride was VERY smooth and took about 1 hr. We heard from fellow passengers that the boats for other departure terminals (Newport Beach & Dana Point, I believe) are different boats which are not as smooth. Boats departed & arrived on time. Staff was helpful and friendly. Seating was pretty comfortable, with areas that included a table for your electronics or to play cards with your traveling companions. Terminal parking was easy and online ticket purchases were efficient. Great way to travel to Catalina Island for a fun day trip or overnights!",HappyGirlAdventurer
50,Great ride to nice destination,"What a great way to get to Catalina! We pre-booked online, and the process was seamless. On our return, we wanted to take an earlier sailing. I think we paid $10 change fee, but it was worth it. Lots of perks of you go on your birthday, too!",bfh195

40,Smooth ride,"It was about 20 years ago when we last took a ferry to Catalina island. As I recall, it took 2 hours and many got seasick from the rough ride. The time to cross to Catalina, from Long Beach is now only 1 hour and the ride was so much smoother. The ships now in use are a vast improvement. Also, the seating was comfortable and the boarding and embarkation process very easy and quick. An overall positive experience.",tdeclue

30,Quick food and healthy,"They serve several items from salads, fruits, sandwiches, baked goods, candies, fries, etc..

40,quick day trip to Catalina Island,"We rode in the Commodore lounge both direction. Enjoyed the seating-more comfort. However, a family with small children seated themselves (well, didn`t do much sitting) next to & around us. All so loud & gave us a trapped feeling. No small children should be aloud or there should be a restricted area. Wait staff was also short handed. We 3/4 through our journey before we saw someone. The boat was nice however and employees very friendly.",Jack J
50,"East travel over in the morning, rough back in the afternoon.","The seas do change. The ride back was such that there were many, after a long day at Catalina who crashed in their sea sickness.

Only ten percent of the island has been developed, the remainder is still in its natural state. What is not to love?Return? YesRecommend? Yes.",Journeyman644

The bottom floor was warm,stuffy and crowded. Worth the day to explore Catalina Island.",Daysie2300

Be sure to opt for the Captains Tour (at least one way) and sit topside with the Captain in his Lounge. You must try the Bloody Marys (no matter the time). Sincerely the best Bloody Mary on the planet. A part of the fun of the Catalina Express is that vessel transports you to your own Mediterranean Experience right in Southern California. Can't beat it. Look for dolphins riding the wake of the vessel.,JAR411

50,A Overall Relaxing Enjoyable Experience,"Being our first trip we did review the fare options and chose the upgraded Commodore Lounge fare which was an added $15 fee. This upgrade provides faster boarding, short lines and a drink and snack. The limited upper seating area is more comfortable, generally quieter and offers better service. The ride was fast, smooth and most comfortable. We took the last boat back to Long Beach and were subjected to a number of loud, obnoxious and obviously intoxicated passengers which made the return trip much less enjoyable. The staff commented this occurs often on the final trip of the day.",Terry B

50,Great for Divers!,"I ride over to Avalon on the Cat Ex out of Long Beach all the time. I'm a SCUBA diver and always have lot's of heavy dive equipment, which the employees of the Cat Ex handle with ease and never give me any problems about it. Sometimes I get an email of a rule change concerning weight restrictions, but I have never had to worry about it once I actually got onboard. It's nice to grab a Commodore Lounge spot on the way home after a day of diving and enjoy a Bloody Mary with an extra green bean (again, great staff). The Cat Ex is always clean, on time and staffed with a great crew. Those who have not been on boats should always take sea sickness medication before heading over to Catalina. While the Cat Ex is fairly stable, there can be big swells in the channel and I have seen countless tourists get sick because they didn't realize they would be seasick.",Katie F
40,Relaxing Boat Trip,"We went to Catalina for my husbands 40th birthday and let me just say this boat trip is pleasant but not cheap. The $15 per day parking in Long Beach just adds to the cost. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the 1 hour boat trip to and from Catalina. On the way to Catalina we sat outside on the deck and the wind felt good since it was starting to get hot.My suggestions:The best seats in the afternoon is on the right hand side of the outer deck. The couple that sat next to us on the left hand side in the middle had to move because the flag kept slapping them in the face and too many people wanted to take pictures on that side.Bring a sweater just in case it gets a little breezy.We didn't leave Catalina until 7:30pm so we decided to sit on the inside for the ride home. The nice thing is that there is a bar inside that also sells snacks. The seating on the inside was very comfortable and looked maintained. The only problem we encountered was with the luggage which is kept in the back of the boat and retrieved on your way out. There was some confusion on which way the line was going to get the luggage but eventually everything worked out.",Exquize
50,Great day trip!,"Great boat ride to an incredible spot off the coast of California. Leaves out of Long Beach or Newport. Check on line for discount tickets and if it's your birthday, the round trip is free. That's a $70 savings.",susieq081659

The cost was somewhat ridiculous and if we had known of another method of getting to Catalina we would have taken it. The ship itself (due to the jet engines) is very noisy.

50,Great trip!,"We were staying in Huntington Beach. We took a long time to decide between the Catalina Express from Dana Point or Long Beach OR the Catalina Flyer from Newport. Very happy that we choose the Catalina Express from Long Beach. The area around the ferry terminal is great to walk around and the aquarium is right around the corner.We headed to our scheduled ferry on August 27th. Even though it was a cloudless day, Hurricane Marie was offshore and causing huge waves. After travelling for an hour to reach the ferry, we were informed that we could take the ferry over but they had cancelled rides back later in the afternoon. We were just planning a day trip so the agent rescheduled us for the next day and provided us with a number to call before we left in the morning.We woke the next day to wavy but gorgeous conditions. Ferries were running. In fact, a few had indeed ran the day before. No biggie. The terminal was full but not crowded. A half hour before our scheduled departure time, we were instructed to assemble for boarding. They boarded the Commodore Lounge folks first. We then followed. The inside cabin is large and comfortable. The staff was friendly. The seats are like airplane seats with a pull down tray. Lots of seats indoor and out. There was a lounge area with bar/snack service. Washrooms were also ample. I see no reason to consider upgrading to the Commodore Lounge.We got underway on schedule. The ferry was near full but we never felt crowded. The ride out of the harbour was smooth. Once we got into the open water, the catamaran sped up. Due to the high waves, a bunch of folks became seasick. I usually have motion sickness but took some ginger ahead of time and felt fine. For those folks that didn't fare so well, the crew was very professional in assisting them with bags and clean up. I felt sorry for them. They looked terrible. They also had to worry about coming back on the ferry at the end of the day.We arrived at Catalina Island in a little over an hour. The island is amazing and worth the expense to get there. For the trip back, we changed our tickets ($5 change fee per ticket) to an earlier ferry. It was not near capacity and very quiet. The ride was very smooth on the way back and went quickly. We were on the voyage with several folks from the morning run. They had a better ride back and appeared to be enjoying themselves with no seasickness. We managed to have a little nap and arrived back at the terminal refreshed. Would do this trip again in a heartbeat!",Travel_With_Tracey
50,Great trip in choppy waters,"Went across in about an hour and it was fairly smooth. It was choppy because of a hurricane South of us.We could only come back at the time we wanted if we paid $15 extra for the Commodore Lounge, and it was definitely worth it. Plush seats, free snacks, and cocktail of choice or soft drink. The closed the lounge door and it was a quiet peaceful trip back.",Bob G

Snacks are provided on board. We traveled at 830AM and got to see dolphins on the side of the boat. Nice. It was out 1st time on a boat so we got a bit of an upset stomach. NO biggie. We got there in an hr. Getting off was easy. We were picked up at 445PM. You can choose what time to go and come back, but pay $5 extra per person if you do not take the chosen times boat.

Boat ride was very stable. comfortable.If you've been on boats you might consider riding inside on this trip. a few times i stepped outside to get some air, and what might not have seemed like much, the boat was actually moving! people in the middle of the afternoon had their hoodies on cuz the wind was pretty high.Seems as though every time I try something new… it's missing something… with this boat ride/tour… you aren't missing much.The destination of Catalina Island was worth it.",digdeep0169
40,Get the upgrade!,"The launch point for the Catalina Express was near the Hyatt Regency, Queen Mary location in Long Beach where we were staying. $8 cab fare. The express is expensive, but there are not that many choices when trying to get to Catalina Island. The vessel is well maintained, and if you upgrade, you can sit up top and get a free drink. At 6am, a bloody mary was perfect! You get that if you upgrade to the Commodore's club. The ride takes 1 hour. Staff are very nice. I believe the round trip for my husband and I was about $170.00",nboutot
50,Wow - it was fun,"We like the trip, location of the launch point, discount we got and the scheduled departures. Comfortable and clean on board, staff very nice. Especially the nice fellow that helped get our tickets and same with the gal that helped us on catalina straighten out a problem with our return trip time.",Lulabelle T
50,Great experience,Very well maintained clean and professionally run vessels. Different seating options available as well as food and beverages Restrooms clean and plentiful on board too. Enjoyed a great ride to and from the island.,Karen W
30,Transport,It is not an attraction. It is the ferry landing for transport to Catalina Island.Clean. Efficient.,Lisa A
50,A nice way to get to Catalina Island,We departed from San Pedro. The berth was easy to find. We took a yacht to Catalina and a catamaran on the return trip. The service was good. Recommend this company.,Mardelle L
50,Great getaway!,"A great way to travel to Catalina. Also, went for free roundtrip on my birthday. This trip included a lot of freebie's on a birthday as well. Catalina loves to have the tourists come through and the Catalina Express is the best way to go. It is only about an hour each way from their Long Beach Launch site. What a wonderful deal!",Fencegal
40,Good ride to Catalina,"This is a great and convenient way to get to Catalina. I do think it is a little pricey but hey there are a lot of options unless you want to take a helicopter. The commadore lounge is an upgrade and around $15 per person more. Just a hint, it gets you a weak drink (Bloody Mary or mimosa) and a cookie of small snack mix. Other than priority boarding, it probably isn't really worth it as you could but those on theBoat for less.",Tiffkat2000
50,Get your ticket early - the boats in the summer fill up fast,"Get's to and from Catalina super easily - but reserve ahead of time as soon as you can 'cause the boats fill up fast. Especially in summer, one or two day ahead may not be enough time to catch the boat you want (especially one leaving for the island before noon).",Will_Swagger
40,Nice ride,"We have ridden the Catalina Express several times. This time we saw a blue whale! Awesome! They are orderly and boats are clean. Crew is always courteous and safety conscious. One can walk around the boat, go outside and feel the sea breeze. We've seen dolphins and whales. A great ride.",DrForgot
50,Excellent trip,"Traveling on these boats was great. I had 2 people with me that usually experience seasickness and neither one had a problem. The boat was clean, the snacks and drinks are reasonalbly priced and seating is comfortable. We saw dolphins and seals on our way to Catalina. Try the Bloody Mary. Very nice.",Andria G
40,Nice place to chill.,"Good place to visit with kids, they have fun in the ferry.Might visit once only, not many times, its kinda gets expensive.we did the golf cart tour,(book online, you get one free hour for a given price) and the semi-submersible).Would have loved to do the zip-line if my kids were eligible to ride.",ilttatw_2222
40,Fast and cheaper than the helicopter,"Great consistent service to Catalina. You know it's bad when the boats aren't running!Many options and times to get there. Been riding regularly since 1988.I do understand fuel costs these days, but the rates have really gotten high.",Ian
40,Fast and convenient,Fast and convenient. A little more expensive than I thought it should be but a nice ride to the Island,Jotravelnut21
50,Great day trip to Catalina Island,The boat was very comfortable both inside and on the outside deck. The breeze is very cool so a light jacket is a good idea. The trip from Long Beach to Catalina Island took about an hour but was very enjoyable.,354nancyb

50,Does exactly what it says on the tin,"Reasonably priced, nice and quick, plenty of dolphins, seals and sea-birds to admire along the way.It's really the only way I'd ever consider getting to the island, and I'd recommend it to anyone.

40,Great way to get to Catalina,"I was last on the Catalina ferry as a teenager in 1963. I was vacationing in LA last October so I decided to take my wife to Catalina on the Catalina Express. The ferry in 1963 was an open boat with bench seats. The Catalina Express is enclosed and climate controlled. The seats are soft, comfortable airline type seats with tray tables. The staff is great. The trip to Catalina was fast and smooth. The only thing I miss from 1963 was live music on board the ferry, and a live band to welcome us at the dock. Even without that the Catalina Express is a great way to get to Catalina.",Kenneth G
50,Gilligan,"Great staff with a great view. Went to Catalina during off season. Boat ride was smooth. Dolphins, seals and late whale were free extras!",bpi45
50,Good Times,FIRST: Get there early to get a good seat.SECOND: Sit back & enjoy.Fun fast ride from LB California to Catalina. Great Crew & Fun Times. You get there (To the island) pretty quick (about an hour or less). Bring cards or a good person to talk to for entertainment for the hr ride. Or take a nap and enjoy. I did...,BluntHonesty
40,Great Crew,"The crew was super helpful. We needed to pre-board & they took the luggage for us. It was great. They run a very organized & smooth operation. Making the reservation by the phone was easy although they got my email wrong & therefore I did not get the confirmation. I did call back a few days later & using my confirmation number, was able to get the email address corrected so I could printout the reservation.",MarcieBCA
50,A great way to start a visit to Catalina Island,"A great ferry service. We made pre-trip reservations and check in was fast and efficient. We booked and travelled 'standard' class which was fine for our 6:30 AM trip to the island, as there was ample seating and space, and the group of travellers were quiet and in anticipation of getting to the island (it was also interesting to see the number of island workers, residents, and construction crew members on this early morning trip -as the ferries are the main / only mass transit way to get to the island.We stayed on the island a full 12 hours - A GREAT day!BUT... on the trip back the last ferry - of course - was full / packed, with several LARGE and LOUD groups of high school students returning from a days 'outing' on the island. So for the return trip, we wished we had booked / up graded to the 1st class / upper deck lounge seating.Over all.... it was a great fun, unique experience!We departed from the central Long Beach dock immediately near the Queen Mary - very convenient, and great parking facilities adjacent to the ferry terminal.",brianwickens407
50,A wonderful experience all the way!,"In mid-June 2014 we took the 10 am catamaran to Catalina Island in gorgeous weather. The staff was pleasant, professional and the boat very comfortable. The seas were kind to the passengers. The cost is a bit pricy, but worth it for safety.",Michelle P
50,Great fun for the whole family,Me and my 9 year old had such a great time. Make sure you upgrade to the lounge with the extra money. Catalina was very nice a bit expense but we enjoyed it.,Carrie C
40,Great way to get to a great place,"For my sister's birthday we paid around $10 extra each way to upgrade to a special section that had good views, comfy chairs, a complimentary drink (good bloody marys!) and a snack. Started the trip off great and it got better when we arrived in charming Catalina. Enjoyed watching the fish crowd around the submarine, saw the bird that follows the sub and does some easy fishing by diving straight into the pack. Had good meals and enjoyed walking around.",TrinaSchoon
50,Easy and Enjoyable Travel to Catalina,"We took our 5 yr old, 1 yr old, and mom on the Express to Catalina. Recommend upgrade to the lounge.",Benton L
10,Book the Titanic...it would be a better experience than Catalina Express,"I would rather be on the Titanic.....HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!We had a group of friends in from Europe and they wanted to go to Catalina. So, we purchased 3 tickets. On the morning of the excursion the one English translator for the group, an RN by the way, woke up with a temperature of 103.5. Clearly in no condition to travel. I called Catalina Express and explained the situation and asked for a ""credit"" on the trip so they could take it a few days later when everyone would feel better. Guess what...they said sorry but no, we won't do that. Really? Give me you manager, but no, that is the policy. Well, that is not the law, you cannot steal someone's money due to circumstances beyond their control. HORRIBLE SERVICE.So, I am going to sue them in small claims court for unjust enrichment, probably will not win, but that is not the point. This is a HORRIBLE BUSINESS - SWIM BEFORE TAKING THIS CROOK'S TUGBOAT/ I doubt very much will come of a little lawsuit to scum like this, but I will burn as much of their time and energy as possible. Don't really care about the money, it is the wrong way to treat people, not a good business at all.I do not know, but I can only imagine how they must treat their employees and how they must cut corners on the maintenance of their leaky tugboats. If you are planning a trip to Catalina, don't use these people, they are not trustworthy in my mind. In fact, just go to San Diego instead, much better value for the money and out-of-town visitors love it, much more to do anyway and you don't have to deal with this ocean scum of a business.",JAGntn
40,The pleasant ride with Catalina Express...,"We heard a lot from friends and relatives about Catalina Island... But how could we get there? On the trip to Southern of California to visit my Mom, my long time friends from oversea and to celebrate my birthday; my wife and I made decision to visit Catalina Island on my birthday. After a little research, the best way for a comfort boat ride, nice boat, friendly service... We go with Catalina Express(Long Beach Terminal)! One excited surprising was this Company offered a free roundtrip to a person who has birthday on the trip day!!! The terminal ticket counter, tours desk and waiting room are nice and clean. Their staffs are very friendly and helpful! After hand me our tickets, they did not forget to greet me on my Birthday and give me a ""Happy Birthday"" sign for my shirt... When I get to the Island, I found out I'm a very special guest on the Island!!! You should print out a list of Restaurants, Ice cream/Coffee Shops, Stores, Museum... Most of these business will offered you something on your birthday! The boat ride are so nice (But for people has problem with sea sick, PLEASE take something with you!!! I would not recommended because some of those medication will make you feel sleepy, you may miss some fun on the Island??? Decision is yours!). The seating areas are clean. I believe on the ""Jet Cat Express"", it has 3 different seatting Room rates(The Captain Lounge, The Commodore Lounge and the regular Lounge...). They also have a Bar to serve Snacks, Beers, Wines, Soft drinks available on board. See their Website for the schedule of the day, of the season schedules, what Cruise boat you will be on... The trip fees... They have 3 different locations: Long Beach, San Pedro(San Diego) and Dana Point. Regular RT. fare from Long Beach to Avalon(Cat. Island) is about $72.00. But, if you are over 55 yr. of age, you will get sr. discount and ofcourse get free ride on your Bday.). ***You should pick early schedule in the morning, so you could have more time to enjoy, to have fun on the Island. ***You should arrive the Boat Terminal 1 hr. before departing time(to get your car parking, to get your boat ticket even you already had your reservation, your Booking number... ***For regular seatting fares, soon as you get your ticket(s), you should go to Departure Gate(Left side of the Gate / Right side for those Upgraded Tickets Guests) to get in line quick so you can pick your seat(s), what side of the boat you want, on the deck(most likely windy) or inside room(if you want to be quiter and comfort). The boat ride, one way, take about 1 hr. 5 min.(little longer when rough sea) for <22 miles> long. There are may be others way to get there, but we are recommended Catalina Express.",SpadinaTexas
40,"Nice boat, friendly service, pricey trip...","The ride over to Catalina Island aboard the Catalina Express is very comfortable, however the price provided a little bit of sticker shock when compared to other ferry rides such as going over to Sausalito and other similar islands. The crew is very friendly and accommodating.",AJ408
40,Efficient service and lovely crew.,"We had heard such a lot about Catalina Island and their attitude to dogs, so we were pleasantly surprised that the Ferry staff and the Island appeared dog friendly. It is true that dogs need to be leashed muzzled or crated on the ferry, but we have a small Eskimo dog who became very overheated due to the muzzle on the way over and the staff did everything they could to help us and her.We went from Dana Point to Catalina just for the day. The ferry booking was problem free, with lots of directions and trouble free parking. We felt the fare was reasonable in May. Our thanks to them for contributing to a great day out and to the crew in particular.",BRoberts92
40,Great day trip,Took a day trip out to Catalina on the express. Only spent time walking around Avalon and had a lovely day. There's plenty to do on the island if longer than a day but be prepared nothing is free. Boat trip out was great although on deck be aware of the weather conditions as it's possible to get sunburned and freeze all at the same time.,Natasha09
50,"Easy, well run operation.","Beautiful day, made easy with the reception and operation of the express. Options to sit inside with A/C, outside in the fresh air. Bar with food, it is all good, so take a day and enjoy.",Fordan
40,Quick way to Catalina Island's Avalon,"Boat ride was about a hour. Pretty straight forward. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would book with them to travel back to Catalina Island again. Also, if you sometimes get motion sickness, definitely take something before going on the boat!",Ellen K
50,Great One Hour Catamaran to Avalon on Catalina Island,"We had some compressed free time on a business conference at the Hyatt Regency, but we really wanted to go ""26 Miles Across The Sea"", so we said what the heck. We left on the 2pm boat (parking for $15 adjacent, and literally five minutes from the Hyatt), arrived on Catalina an hour later, and had a nice time shopping and bar hopping over there at Luau Larry's and Avalon Grill Happy Hour, then caught the 6pm boat back, and made our 8:30 dinner reservation back in town. A really fun trip! Having a little more time would be nice, i.e. go early, and have lunch and/or dinner. But you can still do the afternoon trip like we did and enjoy the diversion! PS We booked the Commodore's Lounge at the last minute....an extra $30 each person round trip, but you get priority boarding, which was real nice given the much heavier general admission crowd both ways, and they gave us a free drink (we had mai tais, and they were good) along with some small snack packs and cookies. Puts you on second level in enclosed area, all with nice windows. Modern catamarans that cut through the water. Highly recommend spending the extra $30)",Conseiller99
50,It's the only way to get there sometimes!,"The Catalina Express is the most reliable way to get to the island. They are courteous and helpful. The trip does not take long and you can take your own snacks. After traveling with them solo for many years, I was on board with my 2 year old and she did get sea sick. I never do and so I was NOT prepared. Never fear! The crew was with me asap helping mop up the mess with a slew of discarded t'shirts. Luckily I was able to clean myself up once I got to the island. Nothing like a quick dip in the sea to freshen you up!",annies133
50,Great Ride,"Took my 10 year old grandson on his first ""boat ride"". It was a magnificent day and the ride was wonderful.",Gloria L
30,Expensive but only game in town,"The Catalina Express is about $70 per person return. Parking is easy and convenient but additional charge. Service at point of purchase for Catalina tickets is poor. Don't buy the return fare, just get the one way each time. Overall experience is okay.",Wonder80

50,Nice ferry trip,"The trip to Catalina on the ferry was nice, but be warned there is no air-conditioning and no windows to open, except on the bow, which we didn't know we could have sat in. I would try a larger ferry in the summer, hopefully they have windows or air-conditioning.",Valerie C
40,"Fast, comfortable transportation and sea lions","Our trip over to the island the morning went smoothly and comfortably. We were even lucky enough to get to see some sea lions! The inside seating was comfortable and insulated from any weather and even the sense of how fast we were traveling.After spending a day touring the island, we had opted for the Commodore's Lounge. This allowed us a quicker loading and included a beverage and snacks.The trip back had a bit more action from the ocean, but still we were warm and dry.Everyone enjoyed the trip!",RAMspeed
40,transportation to Catalina,I use this service every summer to go back to the family summer home. The service runs almost hourly from many ports. Parking at the Long Beach Port is $15 a day! I wish there were alternatives to cheaper parking for longer stays. Most visitors to the island are there for the day.,dougrh
50,Better than before,"This was my second time on the Catalina Express. The trip was great in both directions, and I had just as much fun as I did before.Both boats were clean as usual, and the staff was helpful and friendly, thank you Carey :)Pick up a $100.00 Catalina Express Card at Costco for $79.99 before you go.",Robert M
50,Great ride,"One great thing about the Long Beach ferry vs the Dana Point ferry is the luggage storage. I know this doesn't sound like a big thing, but if you've ever stood on the small dock with a ton of anxious people waiting for your bag.... You would get what I am saying.",wahinisis
50,The only way to fly...,One hour from dock to dock. The boats are large and the seating is comfy. Luggage gets stored as you enter the boat. There is a top deck if you want some sun. Great pictures of the Queen Mary as you pass by. There is a luggage storage place in Avalon if you get there early and want to wander around before departure and check out Avalon.,sailmedic
50,Vroom,"The quickest way to get to/from Long Beach and Catalina. There is an expansive indoor seating area, but 90%of the passengers hang outside for the entire trip. Minimal food and drink bar (they could ask for more money for the items, but it was a little less than I expected), but everyone was more excited around arriving in Avalon. Senior discount rate starts at age 50. All in all, so much better than taking the slow cattle boat!",Joybagg
20,Not so good experience,"We went for a day trip to Catalina island.We were in a rush to get to the 8.30 trip. Once parked... (PARKING FEE COST:$15 ) we ran to the reception good thing I didn't reserved because they were announcing that they were canceling reserved tickets..it was 5 mins to 8.30 Am departure...the receptionist mentioned they were already sold out but had tickets for the commodore lounge which was $15 more I took round a round trip ticket since I need to be in the island for a tour I've reserved. Anyway, what a disappointment... the only difference between the regular ticket and the commodore lounge is that you can order alcoholic drinks ( which was made too taste like water),coffee and some snack.They have some lounge chairs and It have some seats with tables...not all of them.. so if you are the last person to arrive all the best seats are taken and you are left in the middle isle like in an airplane.ANYBODY from the regular ticket and commodore lounge can freely go to the open deck /top deck which we stayed after we took our drinks from the enclosed commodore lounge in the second floor.It have better views and despite the early morning wind it was better for a person with motion sickness to stay outdoors like I do. When we came back at 6 pm, unknowingly we wanted to get the best seats in the lounge so we went 1 hr ahead to stay in line ..alas when we handed our tickets the guy said the receptionist only charge us one way for the lounge and regular seats for our return ticket so we had to go to the regular line which was like a more than 50+ in line already.Once inside all seats were taken and we had to go out to the deck which was already too cold 40-45 F, rainy, very windy, there were lots of families with kids.. in my mind how can you say its sold out in one way but don't control how many people can go back and don't make sure everyone can be seated especially if the weather is bad... they should think about LIABILITY/ SAFETY to all customers not only PROFITS..I felt sooo sick afterwards because it was too cold. for the $179 for two tickets Ill say... just plan your trip at your birthday to get a free trip and spend the money in the Island...best way if you have money get the helicopter ride from Long beach $125 one way and get a ferry back.",Trina S
50,AWESOME!,This was my first time on such a large vessel and my first tide to Catalina Island. Getting on and off the boat was organized and quick (having bought upgraded tickets for the upstairs Commodore seating) and the staff was helpful and friendly. The complimentary drink and cookies were added pleasures!,irtorres
40,Fun Trip to Catalina,"On a sunny, warm day the trip to Santa Catalina Island is best experienced from the top deck outdoors where you can feel the wind in your hair, the sun on your face, and almost taste the salt. For the less adventurous, the comfort of the lounge area might prove more to your liking. Either way, a trip to Catalina on board the Express is a most enjoyable beginning and end to your visit.",Freya1958
50,Best Way to Avalon,"For the price and the time, there is no easier way to get to Catalina. Boats are fast, very smooth, and comfortable! And I can promise you won't get sea sick!!!",DavidCA1
40,A nice trip to and from Catalina Island,"Given that it was my wife's birthday, she was given free passage, so he upgraded our tickets to Commodore class, which is on the upper deck and has nicer seats which recline. We also were given a complementary drink for each of us, which includes wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages, as part of the upgrade. The trip was pleasant in both directions. Transit time to the island was extended as the ship was only running on three engines instead of the usual four, which added an extra half hour to the average time of one hour for the passage. Baggage is not checked, but passengers must carry it on board, where it is placed into baggage areas by the crew, as you board the vessel. You retrieve your baggage as you disembark. Commodore class passengers also get the board first but there is no priority disembarking. The crew was pleasant and helpful. What was curious to us is that while we were given safety instructions, similar to what's given to airplane passengers on the trip over, no such instructions were given on the return trip. I'm not sure if this was standard practice or something was overlooked. In any case the trip went without incident and we had a comfortable ride both to and from the island.",GymAW
40,"Pricey, but pleasant","If you want to go to Catalina, your options are limited: know someone with a boat, ransom a body part for a helicopter ride, or Catalina Express. Or a jet ski, if that's your cup of tea. In any case, Catalina Express is the least expensive option for most of us. But it's still expensive.The last time we went was on my birthday (March 2013), so I got to travel free. Typically we pay a bit extra for the return trip; the lounge is a nice upgrade at the end of a long, exhausting day on Catalina. But the standard seating is fine for the trip out. We got seats by the window, and enjoyed the view on the way: a pass by the Queen Mary, and a cloudy morning that burned off as we approached Avalon, revealing the island minute by minute. A really spectacular view.The catamaran is a relatively smooth ride, and the amenities are fine for the shortish trip. Unless we ever get our own boat, it's our preferred method of travel.I assume this is a review just for the Express, not for Catalina itself. But we really enjoy Catalina; Avalon is completely walkable, but there is much to do beyond, whether you take a golf cart (exhilarating and frightening), a bus (Bison! wild boar!), or a glass bottom boat. We went during their art festival and had a great time, and the restaurants were excellent. When you go free on your birthday, they tag you, and we were given the Birthday Boy treatment all day. Not coincidentally, we spent more than the waived cost of my ticket, so everyone wins.",James W

50,Had Fun,"It was a fun way(probably the only way) to get to Catalina Island. Very quick, great service and we will most likely do this again. Seen some dolphins and lots of seals on the trip over. The top is a nice place to sit to enjoy the sun but gets super windy when it hits full speed.",CarmenPAlberta
10,Find another way to Catalina!,The staff at Catalina Express were the rudest people that I have ever dealt with. The port supervisor was the worst - arrogant doesn't even begin to describe him. The ships are dirty and I do not believe that any of their employees have ever heard of the word customer service.Try to avoid this company at all costs. Take another ship or fly over to Catalina. It’s not worth it to go with those people.,0000AM0000
40,Fun day trip,"Nice high-speed ferry to Avalon, a very pretty Mediterranean-looking town on Catalina Island. We paid $10 more for the luxury seating--comfortable and a good view. Saw porpoises and seals on the way out. We booked a one-hour ""semi-submarine"" ride, with windows looking out at the fish and kelp beds--nice! Look for discount coupons on-line or at the ferry terminal before you go.",David R

30,"Efficient way to see Catalina Island, need to clean the seats, they were dirty","We spent a day in Catalina Island. Other than air travel, the Catalina Express is the most efficient and expeditious way to get to and from the island. The Express gives you free round trip visits on your birthday. The boat is large, stable and probably can hold at least 100 passengers. We rode over on the lower level which is covered and back on the top uncovered area. The Commodore club is on the top level and costs about $30 extra per person round trip.The Express is not very clean and the bathrooms in the waiting areas in Long Beach are atrocious. This something they should really work on. They probably feel their monopoly position does not require them to. But it is shameful that they do not. As I said, we rode back to Long Beach on the top level outside. This was partially motivated by the dirty seats we experienced on the way over.",cmschw@comcast.net

50,Be prepared to sit back and enjoy the relaxing experience,"This was a fast catamaran ride from Long Island to Avalon and back. On arrival by car there were clear signs regarding parking and plenty of spaces, immediately dispelling the stress that one usually anticipates in similar situations.At both ends, the boarding and disembarking arrangements were excellent with well formed queues and clear instructions over the PA system.The seats in the ordinary cabin (non-Commodore or Captain) without needing to upgrade to the pricier cabins were perfectly adequate. There was plenty of leg room and the views from the large windows were spectacular. We caught sight of several playful porpoises and the only regret was that they were not a bit closer!There is provision for drinks and snacks. On the outward voyage, solely due to my clumsiness, I spilt a whole cupful of coffee on the floor. (My excuse was that the paper cup was flimsy and the coffee popped out as soon as I tried to balance two cups and the little doses of milk in two hands!) I offered to pay for a replacement cup of coffee but the kind lady would not hear of it. So I was graciously treated to a complimentary cup despite my incompetence. She also very discretely arranged for the coffee-soaked carpet to be mopped up!The return trip was likewise a flawless operation.The only little criticism was that the voice of the person doing the safety instructions re. donning the life jacket was not quite audible. It may have been better done over the PA system with the demonstrator miming, as they do in aeroplanes.Overall, a great way to get from mainland to Catalina and back. It takes just an hour and is a most relaxing voyage if you have the time to spare and are resolved to simply sit back and relax...",Imliooper
50,Great Trip,"We upgraded to the Commodore lounge - definitely worth the extra $$$. Very comfortable, nice view and a drink and cookie. If you are traveling with more than 1 other person you probably want to get to the terminal early and line up (special line for Commodore lounge and first boarding) because there are a very limited number of seats for a group of four facing each other.",SDCherie
50,Trip to Catalina Island,"The Catalina Express ride was comfortable, aboard a clean well staffed catamaran. Departure and arrival times were met, and the schedule allowed for a full day on the Island. Plenty of friendly fellow passengers to chat with, if you so desired.",Retired801
50,What a Great Way to Get to Catalina!,"Booked our trip online and upgraded to Commodore Lounge. Plenty of parking at the terminal and check in was quick, painless, and professional. Had a pre-trip cocktail in the terminal lounge...staff there was very friendly and efficient. The actual trip over and back was fantastic...smooth ride in large, airline style seats. There's a full bar and snacks are available and the on board staff did a great job. We talked with several folks while we were cruising, then met up with them again in Avalon. Saw several pods of dolphins during the trip. Delightful trip!",SLOGuy7662
40,A Must Do,"Easily booked and choices of times to depart and arrive available. We went on 18th December, this was our daughters birthday so she got a free pass there and back on the boat. Everyone was welcoming and polite, so many people took notice of our daughter s birthday badge and wished her a happy day. She also recieved a list of places on the beautiful island where she would receive something extra as it was her birthday eg. A free scoop of icecream. Our visit was to the port of Avalon and the island is breathtakingly beautiful. It is quaint and very friendly with people to match. The journey there and back took an hour each way and very smooth, I would recommend this as a full day trip or if you have a little more time stay a night or two.",alison o
50,A Great Ride!,"A great ride to Catalina Island from Long Beach. You might see dolphins or orcas on the way. Even if you don't spend much time on the island, the ""boat"" ride is fun. Clean, safe, great people, fun day.",Ilovellamas
40,Anniversary trip to Catalina Island,"Took an early trip to CI on Catalina Express in the lounge. It was very comfortable and the servers were friendly and prompt. Paying a little extra was worth it for us to have a nice, relaxing boat ride to CI. Only issue we had was the darkness to the parking lot when we came home.",Anita S
40,Nice ride,"The Catalina Express is very a comfortable ride. It had nice bathrooms, and comfortable seats, some with tables, and snacks, if you are hungry. It only takes about and hour to travel there from Long Beach.",Nanski
40,A speedy passage to a beautiful island,"Catalina Island is a must for visitors and locals alike. The Catalina Express makes the visit easy to do in a day. However, not all their boats are alike and the catamarans are definitely more sea-kindly than the mono-hulls. Quite good value.",Taran H
50,Love the Catalina Express!!,"It's a real quick trip from the Long Beach landing to Catalina and if you've never rode on a boat, this is the best transportation to use. They have a fully loaded bar with snacks and the seats are extremely roomy.",2Lima
40,Love the ride over!,"Catalina Express is a safe, professionally run, pleasant way to travel to Avalon. How can you not enjoy the trip from the main land to the island? The day we went was smooth, clear weather and nothing but completely enjoyable. You could see the island from the harbor as we left and that is not the usual case. Obviously we got luck to have such a pleasant day to travel, but Catalina Express is a clean, comfortable, smooth ride. Oh yeah, and the view on the way over is great too!",S G
40,Smooth Sailing and Great Services,"The Catalina Express crew did a great job of meeting our needs. We had strollers, bikes and over-sized luggage that their team handled with great care. We enjoyed the Ambassador's ticket with private seating, welcome food and drink and early boarding. If you are prone to sea sickness make sure you get an outside seat and stay in the fresh air.",zkrscasa
50,Wonderful way to travel!,"Very organized company...friendly staff, ran on-time!It was exciting to arrive on the island by boat....seemed that we were far away from home!",Lois7115
50,great ride!,"The Catalina Express was a great ride to the Island, fast and comfortable. Catalina was wonderful to visit, we just didn't schedule ourselves for a longer visit. I do wish they provided a covered waiting area on the Island, it was very hot waiting in the direct sun.",Shortnspicy

50,Beautiful Birthday Ride,"A free ride on my birthday??? Yes, please! We upgraded our tickets to the Commodore Lounge and started my birthday by sipping champagne and sitting by the window on the ride to Catalina. It took about an hour to get there. The harbor is beautiful, there are lots of cute shops with friendly people, and lots of restaurants. We were there for the day - about 4 hrs - and it was plenty of time. I was given a birthday ribbon to wear and lots of people wished me a happy day. There were also lots of freebies and perks for birthday people. This was a fun day.",Lemon60
50,Great ride! Easy easy easy,Easy to buy tickets - easy to board - easy way to get to Catalina - many different times of day to choose from - comfortable ride with clean restrooms and snacks available. Very efficient!,shecars
40,Fast and Quick!,"Catalina Express has an offer to give you a free ride on your birthday! Took my girlfriend with me on this trip! The boats are speed boats, so it only takes about an hour to get from Long Beach to Catalina Island. The service is great and worth every penny!",Brian V
30,"I got a little sick on the boat, but...","overall it was fine. It was a bit confusing, imo, the way they do the tickets, but we worked out where to be and when and the ride itself was good. If you have any tendencies toward motion sickness, you may feel it. I sure did. I was happy to see the shore. For some reason, it was easier on the way back.",Jennifer A
50,Free on your birthday!,"Other than by helicopter (which can be cost prohibitive for most), this is the only way to travel to Catalina en mass. Convenient departure and return times and very fast! Plus, your fare (RT) is FREE on your birthday so no reason NOT to visit Catalina at least once per year and enjoy a special birthday lunch or dinner!",Sylliness
40,Great Ride,"It was a lovely ride, we saw dolphins and the views on the ride were amazing! It was an easy check-in and they were able to take the AAA discount.",Vanessa1522
40,Nice way to travel ... beware of the cost!,"The ""Express"" offers fast transportation to & from Catalina Island, but it will cost you. If you go on your birthday .. it's free. The one-way trip is about an hour, ride is pleasant (depending on weather), seats comfortable, and staff helpful. If you're staying overnight, there are luggage weight restrictions. Hope this is helpful, when planning your next adventure.",FLworldwanderer
50,Off to the Island,"While I travel often to the island often for work, I have one tip to travelers: If you get seasick, take your seasick pills the night before you travel. They will make you drowsy so you'll get a good nights sleep and it's still in your system without the drowsy effect the next day (they last 24 hrs). I always take in the winter when the sea is rougher. Sea bands are also great if you forget. it is always rougher going to the island. While I have a tendency to get sick I have never needed on the way back. Hope this helps.",Blondieinsocal
30,Good but a bit pricey,"Nice transportation, but a bit pricey, with no student discount. I think the price would be lower if there are competitors.",Chloe N
40,great day trip,"A group of friends took the Catalina Express over to Catalina Is. had a great day, shopping, eating, drinking. We rented golf carts and drove the island. The boat was a little bumpy coming back but didnt bother us since we are all boaters. Great Day.",diamondgirl
50,Loved taking the Catalina Express!,"Staff is terrific and spend the extra money to sit upstairs in the Commodore Lounge; the attendants bring you a drink and a nice sized cookie or snacks (beats standing in line downstairs for everything!)On our trip over to Catalina on this past Saturday, the Captain needed to slow down to pass hundreds of dolphins that were swimming with us! At first, there were only a few then it was fishes and loaves time; they were all around us! You definitely don't see a sight like this in either the Hudson or East River (or even off the coast of Coney!)Sorry that the photo isn't better; it really doesn't do justice to how breathtaking an experience this was (took it with my i-phone).Was not expecting to see anything like this and you may not on your crossing (did not see any on the return to Long Beach); but for a Brooklynite, it was wonderful!",BZM_13
50,Easy process and great breakfast to boot,"The location is easy to find: just off the 710 freeway. Parking was plentiful when we arrived in the morning. The waiting area has many breakfast options, all of them looked very good. The ride to and from Catalina were both very smooth. My wife and I each took a nap.",JackandResh
50,Last minute added stop - great addition to our trip,Boat was great -we spent a little extra and did Commodore Lounge which was very comfortable and relaxing. About 80 mins of travel. Catalina Island was beautiful and some of the most spectacular views I have seen. We did a quick 50 min tour then adventured on our own with golf carts. Lots of restaurants and shops. We threw this into our last day as we had nothing planned and it was a nice relaxing day!! One of my favorites!!!,gallaghertrish
50,It gets you there and back!,"I used the shuttle to go to Catalina on 2 consecutive days, one day for diving, the other to sightsee. This isn't the ""Queen Mary"" or some luxury yacht folks......that isn't good or bad. What it IS, is a reliable, safe shuttle that is very timely with multiple bathrooms. If you have dive gear or luggage, it's a painless process bringing it on board. What seems to hamper its speed is a constant fog that lingers all day between Long Beach and Catalina. Other than that it's fast and efficient. If I had to caution anything about this boat it's the return trip. Getting drunk and an hour plus boat ride back to Long Beach doesn't seem to settle well on some folks lol, so pick your seat mate wisely or you may be vomited on. The docking harbor is nice on both ends with well lighted, ample parking on the Long Beach side.",David H
50,26 Miles across the sea...,My friends and I used this ferry company to go over to Catalina Island.The employees were very helpful and the ferry was clean. There was room for everyone to sit. The only drawback was I think the ferry company should put on their website that warm clothing should be worn when crossing the ocean. It got really cold. We did see a school of dolphins on both sides of the ferry. Which was pretty cool.,Phyllis V
40,Good way to reach Catalina island,"A bit pricy, it's free if you go on your birthday. Takes about an hour to arrive at Catalina island. Sometimes very cold because of the AC. Outdoor seating available but also can be cold of it's late time (evening) so make sure bringing a cardigan or jacket to keep yourself warm.",Seona J
50,Day Trip to Catalina...Excellent!,Easy and convenient hour trip over to Catalina. Super quick (1 hour) and the waters werent overly choppy in May. Cost (about $70) for round trip was reasonable.,Nathan H
20,Sent us to the wrong terminal,"We reserved this and received a confirmation email. We arrived at the state terminal and were told we had to go to the other terminal about 10 minutes away. We showed them the email and they just smiled and repeated to go to the other terminal. The boat is very basic, it's just a ride back and forth to Catalina Island. Note - your trip is free if it's your birthday, ID required.",Aussie1fan
50,On time and comfortable,"The Catalina Express is a great way to get to the island. It takes about an hour and fifteen minutes. There is open seating and there are also photo opportunities as the boat approaches Catalina. There is a snack bar on board, but the offerings are very limited. If you plan to eat lunch on the way, it would be best to bring your own.",MaestraM
50,Great trip to Catalina,"We booked our tickets online and decided to take advantage of the Commodore Lounge seating. We had excellent seats, one drink and a snack in each direction. Parking is convenient and close by. Our upgraded tickets allowed us to board in the first group - this was so nice since it was very hot already. Travel time is one hour. The workers are so friendly and helpful. What a fun trip!",Judi D
40,Bring your gravol but well worth the trip to Catalina. It is so easy!,Remember you're still on the Pacific Ocean bouncing all the way to Catalina on a wavey day. The boat is wonderful and you have a lot of different choices as to where you want to sit. Indoors or outdoors..It takes about 1 hour and your are transported to an Island in the Pacific. It has everything on it. Just plan before you go as to what to do and see and then your day will be complete. You can stay on the island too.You leave from Long Beach and over...have fun and travel well.,Truenorthandfree
50,Quick getaway to Catalina Island,"We upgraded to the lounge as it has wider seats, is more comfortable and you receive a single drink and small snack (more is available to purchase) There is enclosed seating on the first deck so it is up to you. The nice thing about the lounge is the comfort. Great fast way to get from one place to another. Be aware though that they are sticklers for timeliness.",BeeJL56
40,Part of the Trip is the Journey,"This is such an efficient and well oiled machine.. Jump on and go for an hour to Catalina, walk around and enjoy being in a completely different place. Get there via the Catalina Express or a helicopter. We chose the Express. It's definitely more expensive than it should be and that may keep many a day tripper away. But there are loads of employees and a nice ship that must be payed for and it's a special thing, not a Staten Island rush hour thing.What you need to know: the seats in the normal cabin are unbelievably uncomfortable. They have metal arm rests (really? who thought of that..?) and are positioned almost as straight up as old Aunt Martha's spring ready car seat. BOING.On the way out we sat in this cabin thinking it's only an hour and who cares. But we suffered slightly in the uncomfy seats and crowded quarters.The return we forked the extra $15 each and thank goodness! Seats reclined, it was less crowded, we didn't have to wait as long in the beating sun in line, got a stewardess who presented us with a free drink and a cookie. For my kids and I it was completely worth it.",LowMilesMom
50,Great Day Trip,"Great day trip. Something for everyone. We were with friends. Some golfed, some went to the beach and some walked, shopped and had cocktails",eddie223
50,NIce option,"We booked a regular seat on the way to Catalina Island and were not disappointed. We were able to get window seats that were very comfortable. The trip took about an hour, but even though the water was a little choppy, the captain did a great job. The added bonus was being able to see dolphin, sea lion, and a few large fish on the way (I have no idea what they were). Although, we decided to rent gear when we arrived at the island, several people were able to bring camping gear, bikes, and pets on board, which I thought was very nice. The young men who were assisting with boarding were very courteous and offered to help several families with small children on board and even carried strollers and baby carriers aboard for passengers.The head was a lot bigger than I expected and I was able to change into my bathing suit inside.Also, if you are nervous about taking a trip over open water, it was nice to see the Coast Guard out on patrol in Long Beach and then close to the coast of the island.Overall, very nice trip and I will definitely use Catalina Express again.Tips-1) Buy your ticket online or make a reservation on the phone as the boat fills up quickly2) Arrive 30 minutes prior to departure time so you will have ample time to park and get situated (they have a snack bar inside)",amaris1922
50,Ocean transport from Long Beach to Avalon,"We visit Catalina Island as often as we can and always seem to have the nice ride from the mainland to Avalon. The boat is spacious and the trip with the Catamarans really makes even the choppy water trip not too unpleasant. The hour long trip has always given me something to see whether it is dolphins or even the large container vessels, the trip seems to always have something to see.",Greatplacesnv
50,Express to another world.,"I wanted to go to Catalina for the day and the Express out of Long Beach had the most convenient times. The staff I encountered were most helpful, from the call center, to the ticket counter, and the staff on the boat. It made my journey hassle free.oil for discounts online from auto clubs to senior. Try to get online early to sit mid to rear of boat for a smoother ride.",JerrylovesTuscany
40,A fun 26 mile boat ride,"I truly enjoyed the boat ride to Catalina and back again, after spending a couple of days in Avalon.I upgraded to the Commodore lounge for an extra $15.00 each way. This gave me priority boarding, bigger seats, more windows, a snack, and a free drink. I felt it was well worth it.The crew was friendly and professional, and the ship was clean with plenty of room for everyone.",Robert M
50,An easy way to get to Catalina,"I just took a day trip on the Express from Long Beach to Catalina this week. I got two tickets, one for my bike and one for me. Taking a bike is an inexpensive way to ""make 30 minute walks into 5 minute rides"", as another cyclist transporting his bike back to the mainland told me. depending on the boat and the seas, you may or may not get salt spray on your bike. As others have said, the boat is clean and spacious with comfortable seats. Finding and parking in the structure is easy. I have done this two years in a row for my free birthday trip and enjoyed the trip both times. Waiting lines are orderly and boarding is quick.",luvtogo09
50,fast trip to Catalina,We went to Catalina on this boat and it was a fast trip. about 20 minutes or so. The island of Catalina is so beautiful. Wonderful day.,trustme58
50,all aboard the dreamboat,"After living in Los Angeles for 11 years, I finally decided it was time to visit Catalina Island. The Catalina Express ferry boat offers a free round trip on your birthday (value: $73), so there I was at 11am on my birthday at the Long Beach port. Catalina Island was fun but getting there was half the fun! The boat from Long Beach to Catalina in the morning was a small craft and we sat outside on the open-air second level. What a fun trip! It was so cool to see the mainland slowly disappear and beautiful Catalina Island appear in one hour's journey.But what I didn't expect was the super awesome and good-looking staff sailing and anchoring the ship. The captain of our boat was literally a dreamboat. He was handsome and friendly and his staff of helpers were all equally awesome. My boyfriend and I agreed it was the jetliner of the seas. Love boat, anyone?On the return trip at 6pm the same day, out boat was much bigger and all seats were indoors (I guess since it was evening on a Saturday - much higher volume of passengers). It was so comfortable and enjoyable. We got two seats by a window and even charged our phones at the outlet next to our seats. You can sidle up to the bar and get a beverage or just enjoy looking out at the beautiful sea. While the smaller morning boat was a little bit bumpy (in a fun way!), this boat was completely smooth. It was like being on a plane.Boarding was quick and easy and the short walk to our car in the parking lot made the whole day-long voyage a snap. I recommend the Catalina Express - especially if it's your birthday because with your ticket, they give you a birthday ribbon to wear around Catalina and you will see all the other people who share your birthday. This is so fun! I wished ""Happy Birthday"" to about 10 people throughout the day. That's why they call it ""Birthday Island.""Overall, everyone at the Catalina Express dock and ferry were super friendly and experienced in sailing, so I felt at ease and happy on my hour-long voyage from Los Angeles to the island and back.",andromeda69

40,"Convenient, relaxing. Under $75 RT.","Think Dos Equis: ""I usually fly my own plane from Long Beach to Catalina Airport, but when I don't, I ride the Express.""The ride is seldom bouncy, but the waves are slightly noticeable when sitting. I enjoy the refreshment bar and the prices are reasonable. The coffee was good, too. I was impressed when, after the initial customer rush subsided, the attendant visited the rows of cabin seats to ask if anybody wanted any refreshments, she deserved her tip.Pros: 1 hr ride, comfortable, affordable, snacks and drinks, nice views with inside and outside seating.Cons: They leave the inside fluorescent lights on the entire time, unnecessary and annoying. Too chilly inside the cabin. Steep parking fees at mainland landings.",Pilotchip
10,Sad decline in service,I have been a cat express customer for many years. I even recall their number was 5191212 with no area code!!!!!! Friendly service has washed away like a sand castle. Boat captains all walk around like they are high and mighty and no longer visit with passengers. Young deckhands are conceited and will talk only to their high school pals. Even noticed recently a deckhand with his shirt unbuttoned. They sadly cancel trips and make you check in to see if you can sail home. TOTALLY not fair and not a good way to relax on the island. Hoping the original guys can return some of the great service that used to be there.,paul b
50,Sweet Sailing,"Two to three times a year my husband and I take the Catalina Express to cross the 26 mere miles to our favorite, relaxing hideaway--to take in the sights, hike our favorite hikes, read, and relax! We always try to make one of these trips on one of our birthdays; since you are allowed to cross for free on your birthday! When on board, we usually sit on the top deck in the shade, so I don't get seasick or sunburned. The crossing is pretty quick; and there is just a 5-min. walk from the landing to the center of Avalon. It is amazing how within an hour of departure from Long Beach, I feel like I have arrived to a European destination. Catalina is one of those best-kept secrets of Southern California.",Evelina62
50,Great service,"Easy boarding process, plenty of space onboard, and a nice ride over to Catalina Island. We were in regular cabin, did not upgrade. But there was plenty of room and I found an upgrade unnecessary for a 1 hour boat ride. On the way back we sat on the top deck outside, beautiful ride.",DCV77

50,Beautiful boats and fabulous employees!,"I was born and raised on Catalina and I have used the Catalina Express to travel back and forth for many years. I have owned and operated a small wedding planning business on the island for the past 10 years and have had many satisfied customers thanks to the Catalina Express. From the days when the Express had just one small boat to today as they run a fleet of boats with extreme success.. I want to say that I am thankful that Greg and Tommy along with many many dedicated employees have done such an amazing job! First of all they are always on time...which is so comforting when people have flown in from all over the world and still need to take a boat to get to the island! Their boats are clean and always in good working condition, this I know because I see one of their mechanics (Tim) on the boats every time I travel. The Captains are there to greet you as you load the boat and the deck hands are friendly and extremely helpful. Now to talk about the girls that work asstewardesses and make the drinks or bring you crackers. Most of them have all been there for years and when I say years I mean since the company beganback in the early 80's. This company must be doing something right if people stay for more than 30 years! Also, if you need additional help with any number of things you can always call passenger services and Mary Anne is there toassist! To wrap it all up I am a big fan and very thankful for the Catalina Express!Cathy Machado",Aneventtwobe
50,Great day trip! Register online to go free for your birthday.,We went for the day and had a blast. About an hour plus on the ocean... Snacks and a bar downstairs. Some some dolphins and flying fish. Plan and schedule your excursions on Catalina before hand. It's kind of a scramble to get a spot and plan the most for your day. We loved the tour bus through the island. Glass bottom boat sounds exciting but we found it boring as the water is dark and murky. Kids might like it.Def worth it!!,HedyvonRibbonTroff
50,Great day trip from LA area,"love the Catalina Express experience..easy reservations, smooth sailing, nice staff, and quick!For 'land lubbers', know that on one trip, my friend started to feel a bit queasy (pretty common, no doubt) and the crew immediately responded. They calmed her, gave her tips to reduce the discomfort, and watched over her. The tip is a good one: look out at the horizon, not the water. Do I have that right?",dshepard562

40,Efficient,"Too many people set stuff on seats on lower deck and then wandered about the boat or sat on upper deck. So if you arrive late you will be on the exposed upper deck with no way to warm up without standing below. They should enforce some sort of policy if you leave your seat for 20 or more minutes you lose your seat.Also left 7 minutes late. Not big but I had to get out of LA basin because of possible Martin/Zimmerman conflicts so added to ""Escape from LA"" feelings.",FromVegas

50,Commodore Lounge - its worth the small price increase,"Have used Catalina Express from both Dana Point and also Long Beach. All trips were excellent, but we find that spending the bit extra for the Commodore Lounge is worth it. Not having to wait in line in the hot sun and the added standing is difficult for both my wife and myself. The trips have all been on-time, smooth, comfortable, and with excellent service from helping my wife get her scooter aboard, help with luggage, and cabin service. The only suggestions I have for Catalina Express would be: add some benches at the loading areas so older guest and people who can't stand long periods of time could sit. Or using a a boarding by group, or small fee for head of the line.TIP, San Diego Costco as of June 2013 has $100.00 Catalina Express gift cards for $79.00 which is a great value and can even be used when booking and paying on-line.",Michael R
40,No Real Choice but They Do a Great Job,"You can fly to the Island of Catalina for a great price, swim or take the express. This is an efficient operation from start to finish. Book ahead as they do run out of space. Arrival in Long Beach, they are easy to find. Parking right across the street. Multiple teller to take your money unless you book on line which is simple and easy. Clean large Catamarans. Very stable. Friendly crew that serves drinks and snacks. Upgrade to the Commodores lounge. It is well worth the smaller line, better seats and free drink.",CWS55
40,Fun! Free on your birthday!,"We decided to go because the boat ride is free on your birthday! This is usually about $75.My friend signed up the day before his birthday to get the deal. (Of course, everyone else in the party buys their own non- birthday ticket.)Offered until April 30, 2014. http://www.catalinaexpress.com/birthday_promo.phpGetting a reservation at Dana Point one day in advance was limited. Most of the trips were already booked up. So we went further from home & booked a reservation from Long Beach.Long Beach has a lot more trips to choose from. Downside besides the distance is the parking is an additional $15.We went early on Saturday morning about 7 AM so the parking garage and the terminal was not crowded at all. At the counter the clerk said my VISA credit card was declined. ? I had to use another credit card (AmEx) but they would make an imprint which is less secure. Afterward I called the credit card company & they said there was no problem with my card but it showed that Catalina Express never attempted to put a charge through to my card. Weird?Otherwise everything was fine. The boat has upper & lower levels with inside seating on both levels. There is outside seating in the back on the upper level. It was socked in this morning, typical June gloom, kind of cool. Once we started moving it was too cold for me with the wind so I went inside, but my boyfriend had a warm jacket & winter cap so he stayed outside the whole trip & enjoyed it very much. The views seem to be good from all seats upper & lower. They sell some snacks & drinks. Bathrooms on both decks. The trip was supposed to be an hour but it actually took an hour and a half. Return trip that evening was similar but a little warmer.I think I may go again when my birthday rolls around ... :~)",B0hdana
40,Great Way to get to Catalina,Believe me. You WANT to go to Catalina and this is the way to go. It's affordable and efficient. You can also just show up and they'll be able to hook you up with plenty to do once you get to the island. Really nothing negative to say at all.,Jane S
50,Great Service,"We recently used Catalina Express for our getaway to Catalina Island. We were very impressed with the service. Our driver picked us up at our hotel near LAX at exactly the time indicated and was waiting at the ferry landing in Long Beach on our return. Very efficient, no surprises. We highly recommend this company if you are flying into Los Angeles on your way to Catalina Island and do not want to rent a car.",Jennifer G
50,Free...,I signed up and went for my birthday and ended up going by my self and it was the best trip I have had! The boat had everything to keep me occupied. Wonderful experience!,lmgonz
20,Not a way to do business!,"The ride on the ferry was fine and the crew on the boat were fine, but ticket people were no help! We had reserved tickets at 10:00am and back at 7:30pm, on the way over they said they may have some problems later with currents and have to cancel the 7:30pm ferry. When we got off the ferry in Catalina we checked at the ticket office and they said to come back at 3:30pm to see if the last one would be canceled or not.We had an island tour scheduled so did that and ate lunch and went back to check and they said they could not tell us if the last one was going to be canceled or not until after the 3:45 ferry left. We checked with 3 different ladies in the ticket office and they all said the same thing and none of them were very nice about it.So since we were registered in a hotel in Long Beach we had to leave. The ticket ladies said if the last one was canceled we would have to get a hotel on the island or sleep on a bench outside. I understand that they can not control the weather or currents, but when it is 72 degrees and a sunny beautiful cloudless day you would think they could decide if they were going to run the last ferry before the next to the last left.",Marcy K
50,Fun Fun Fun,Spent two nights at the Catalina Island Inn. The ride over was made even better by upgrading to the Commodore Lounge where drinks were served. We had Virgin Bloody Marys. Awesome!!!,CaptBobLB

40,FREE round-trip Boat Ride on your birthday!,"Just register ahead of time, get your birthday code, make your reservations and show up with your ID and you get to travel to Catalina Island for FREE. I sure appreciate this promotion, as my daughter, myself and her boyfriend all share the same birth date and this saved us over $200 just in travel expenses.When first trying to do my reservations, I had a bit of trouble with their site, but I emailed them and one of their representatives emailed me back and another called me and answered all of my questions in a very professional and friendly manner.We opted for the 6:15am departure; therefore, we arrived at the Long Beach terminal around 5am. The girl at the customer service desk that registered us, initially seemed unfriendly, almost irritated when I handed her our birthday reservations/codes/ID's, but once she was done registering us and handing us our birthday ribbons, she became all smiles so I am not sure if that was just her ""professional"" face.This was my second trip to the island, using the same company. The boat is very clean, which I appreciate a lot. I cannot stand dirty seats nor dirty environments.I can't speak too much about the staff as the interactions were limited. The greeters were very friendly, wishing us each a happy birthday; however, the staff on the boat did not really interact with passengers and they did not go around doing rounds, checking up on anyone. The trip was mostly smooth, few rare moments where the motion was rough and got to our stomachs, nothing Dramamine couldn't take care of. We did see dolphins on our way, which was nice.Our return trip was not as peaceful, we were all tired and mainly trying to nap, but there was a group of about 15 young men that were INCREDIBLY LOUD and made the trip very uncomfortable and annoying. In situations like these, I do wish the crew would ask passengers to keep the noise levels down because some folks take their babies and like in this incident, the loud laughter and conversations did also wake up a sleeping child. Btw: this type of disruptive noise level did not occur during our first trip to the island in 2012.Overall, this was a nice experience. Would use their services again.",aztkdiva
50,Free Ride on Your Birthday makes you feel like a Queen!,"Catalina Island is a great escape from the urban sprawl of Southern California. Once you head out to sea, you can leave your troubles behind. For my birthday, I took advantage of the ""free ride"" on Catalina Express (you have to go to their website and book in advance!) Not only was my round trip free, I received discount coupons for many Island attractions. We hiked to the top of the mountains, and had an amazing scenic view! (check the Catalina website for hiking info and permit.) Great ride, great adventure, great price!",JanAboutTown
50,Go on your Birthday...it's so worth it!,"So because Catalina is celebrating it's 100th birthday, they are giving everyone the opportunity to come to Catalina for free on their birthday. You just need to register and get the code and make a reservation. You need to travel on your actual birthday, but you can stay on the island overnight or for a few nights. Everyone from the reservations customer service (Nicole) to the crew on the boat were exceptionally friendly and make you feel really special on your special day. We did the general seating for the ride to Catalina and sat upstairs outside in the very back. Definitely the best place if you don't mind wind and a little chilliness. We took the 10 AM boat and for me, it was perfect. On the way home, we took the 6PM boat and upgraded to the Commodore Lounge. It's 15.00 each way to upgrade and you get a free beverage and snack. (a chocolate chip cookie or a trail mix type snack) plus you get to board the boat first. (not that big of a deal, since we are sitting in a special section anyways.) We sat inside for the ride home and it was OK. We ended up walking to the back of the boat outside just for a few minutes and got a rare look at a bunch of jumping dolphins. It didn't seem too cold but we only stayed out there for a bout 10 minutes. The crew again was exceptionally friendly and we had a nice enjoyable ride back to Long Beach. I'm not sure I would pay to do the Commodore Lounge again, but I would get in line for general seating extra early to be one of the first people on the boat so you can choose your seats because it fills up pretty quickly.",hbgirl-forever
50,What a birthday !,"The Catalina Express gives out free pass to you on your birthday if you pre-register. Not knowing what i wanted to do on my birthday ,I opted to try this. Took the express out of San Pedro and it was awesome ride to Catalina. We spent the day enjoying the sites, Had a couple cocktails but that wasnt how I wanted to spend my entire day. We decided to rent a couple of jet skis and enjoy the water. We boarded the water taxi and went out to the barge that the jet skis were docked.It was getting close to evening so we decided to use the wetsuits. It was a good decision. The jet skis were top notch and fast. The water was great but the highlight of the whole day was cruising with about 20-25 dolphins that came thru the area..I had done alot of wave jumping so I bruised up three toes but besides that My birthday we an awesome experience.",pls7675
50,My birthday,"Great trip, smooth ride, very nice staff. Explained to us about stuff to do and where to go on the island. Would definiately go again.Go to the Lobster Trap for lunch. Great food and great places. A must to eat here if you are in Catalina.",Theresa H
30,quick,"I love how quick and easy this ride is...used to take hours...In my opinion, I feel this is overpriced and, unless you fly or have (or know someone who has ) a boat, they have you... A bright spot is that if you register with them, you are free on your birthday.",elliotts321
30,Fun way to get to the island,"Trip was awesome. A pod of dolphins followed our oat and gave us a show. Two groups of middle aged women were there that had brought their own booze, so were drunk and screamed every time a dolphin jumped. It was definitely an entertaining experience.The weather was perfect that morning. Only a little breezy so we rode up top and enjoyed the view. I was able to leave two of my bags downstairs so i only had my purse and i felt they were safe. The return trip was a breezeThe only issue we had was that Catalina Express wouldn't honor our AAA coupon because it had an expired date; however, AAA had told us beforehand that it would be fine. Not good customer service there - I guess Catalina Express was worried about not getting reimbursed but they could have been more accommodating.",KNGA03
40,Fun day trip or short weekender,"I think the cost has gone up a lot over the last few years, we paid $85 for a return ticket and they refused to give the AAA discount...you must print the coupon online - very unevironmental.Don't waste your money on VIP, there is great views off the back of the boat sitting in the sunshine, and you can walk to the bar yourself and get a drink. We had to do VIP on the way home cause the regular seating was sold out.....I wouldn't do it again unless I had too.Book in advance for the weekends, especially in the summer, they do sell out in advance.Avalon is a fun town to explore, a day is enough, but it's more fun to relax and spend a night if you can find a place that will rent (most places are 2 night minimums which makes it a very expensive weekend getaway).",cutecdnchick
50,A great way to go to Catalina,"This is a nice way to spend a day crossing to Catalina. Not too expensive, and a quick but not hurried trip.",OCProfessor
40,Like being in another country but only 26 miles offshore!,"Catalina is a worthwhile day or weekend trip. You can recharge with a quick jaunt to this sleepy little Island aboard Catalina Express.

You can bring your bike, your dog, and no extra charges to stow things away.",DiAnnesInLove
40,Riding the waves to Catalina,"An annual visit to Catalina Island is a must, and for those within the greater Los Angeles area that don't have their own boat, the easiest way is via Catalina Express. A fast-moving boat, once it's out of the dock area in Long Beach, the Catalina Express stops in Avalon on all trips, and occasionally both Two Harbors and Avalon. I suggest picking a trip that stops in Two Harbors, since you'll get a chance to see the length of the island from close in...",Braintrust

50,Only and Best out of Dana Point,"We departed from Dana Point and I was glad we drove down the day before to find the long term parking you move to after obtaining your ferry tickets. Don't arrive late not knowing what's what. The ferry ride for us was part of a package so we just presented our printed receipt. The suitcases are dropped down a tube so if you have valuables, carry them. The ferry ride was easy since I took a Dramamine, but it was pretty calm. Very clean and organized the Dana Point ferry only leaves and returns once a day. Long Beach has more departures.",ruthandvern

40,The fastes swimming refrigerator on the west coast,"The Catalina Express is a very efficient way to get over to beautiful Catalina Island for a day trip or a longer stay. The complete process from ticket reservation online tocheck in is really good - some airlines should learn from that. Watch out for the ocean weather when taking your trip if you are sensitvie to motion sickness.. There is one negative point however the Catalina Jet is heavily airconditioned that even in spring time it's colder inside then outside. Guys really, you could save some gallons of diesel or go faster if you set the inside temperature to 65 instead of (a feels like) 45...think about it. Travelers : take a warm sweater with you",Skysurf88

50,The most cost effective and efficient way to Catalina Island,With 4 departures a day from L.B.C and 6 from Avalon you have several options to taylor make your excursion to and from Santa Catalina Island.

50,Birthday Getaway,"For my birthday, Valentine's Day, we went to Catalina. I signed up for the ""Free Ride"" on you birthday with Catalina Express, which I would reccomend. We did the upgrade to the Commodore's Club and it was worth it. Early boarding, nice seats and a friendly wait staff. On the trip over we saw dolphins and a small pod of Finback Whales! We took the last express back in the evening and it was just as nice. You could see the coastline start to appear in the distance until you are back in the harbor.",Lars_92705
30,Take the upgrade,"For a little more money you can upgrade to the upper deck, where you have more room, early boarding and a bit more comfort. If you set your mind to compare this to the Greyhound of the sea, you'll be fine. The crew is far from friendly, and seems to be somewhat bitter about their career choices. But you get there, quickly and safely.",Mike90275
40,Basically the only way to get to the island,"If you are not fortunate enough to own your own boat, Catalina Express is really the only way to get to the island. The price may seem a bit high but when you factor in the cost of fuel and the flexibility of schedule it is very fair. We had dolphins fallowing our boat on the trip to and from the island. I grew up taking the express every summer to visit the Island and this past Spring I made it back after an 11 year absense. it seems that there have been some positive changes , now you can buy snacks and drinks and wander out to the roof top if you wish. The island it's self felt like a blast from the past Avalon as charming as I always remember it to be.",KRL32

The birthday gal or boy goes for free. To bring bikes is possible for another small fee. I totally loved how everybody on the island and on my way home in the evening was wishing me happy birthday because I was wearing a ribbon that said it was my birthday. The trip is short, a little over an hour. The sea was calm, but it can get rougher although usually not in the mornings. A little boy was puking, the poor thing, totally no sea legs.

The timeing is good as we arrived a little after 10am and didnt depart til 3 days later at 4.30 so it allows you plenty time on the island. Being from Scotland I am not used to really warm sunshine at New Year and Avalon is just so quaint and at night it is beautifully lit up everywhere coupled with a full moon made it the most romantic new year ever...,NoisyMouse

ID is required, so no tricking them! Of course, other members of your party must pay the normal fare, but for two of you to explore the island, certainly worth it, but make sure you are booked on the Catamaran, as it is smoother and faster than their other boats.

We stayed at the Maya the night before (5 min from the dock and a very cool hotel) so we were close and did not have to deal with traffic stress in the am. You are limited on baggage, but not to a point where is a big sacrifice. Look on line for details as they may change.",ACBraddock

You get a majestic view of HMS Queen Mary as you slowly move out of the harbor, then once you pass the breakwater, you are on your way to Catalina, slicing smoothly through the waves. Food and beverages are available for purchase, and the crew was quite friendly. There are slower methods of getting there, but none could be quite this comfortable.",John D
40,Nice boat ride,"Very good. Went both ways. The inside ride was kind of sea sicky but on the way back we sat outside and the fresh air made it all better. The staff was very nice. I might want to try the helicopter ride next time to avoid the motion sickness. No fault of the boat. Just a little choppy sea water in the afternoon and being confined to inside wasn't pleasant. Of course it was my choice. I could have gone up to the top deck and got fresh air but dumb me, took a Dramamine and was too sleepy to move. Got smart on the way back and didn't take Dramamine and sat outside. Might try to go on my birthday for FREE!",Susan L
40,Ride off to Catalina,"I've lived in Long Beach for like 16 years and finally I planned a trip to Catalina Island. There are very few ways to get to Catalina Island and we picked the Catalina Express. It was a nice large ferry that got us to Catalina fast. I brought my bike and I was permitted to bring it along for a few dollars more. The only thing is that it's a bit pricey, a little over $80 for one person including my bike fee. It was like $160 for 2 so unless you have the money, beautiful island as it is, I wouldn't come too often.",Melissasweet99
40,A california ferry,"I've taken the ferry in Greece and Ireland and wondered if there was one similar in California. And so I went with a bunch of friends to spend an afternoon in Avalon. With today's pace one would like things to go faster but if you have friends to talk to and have a drink with, you don't mind the wait. I don't like the smell of diesel but you can stay topside and have the wind blow on your face. Try to imagine that you are a child again and you are patient enough to go through the waters, it will cleanse your soul a bit. Remember the boat ride to Alcatraz in San Francisco and that lovely romantic ferry ride to Sausalito from the Ferry building. It brings me back to those memories. So live and dream and remember... It will do your soul good.",LizC2012

Standing in the afternoon without shade, for thirty minutes could be tough.The LB lounge is retro Greyhound-bus-depot with plastic seats. The place is airy and clean and has a fast food deli and small restaurant. Restrooms are basic but will do.Free Wi-fi is available and is reasonably dependable.

The Express has very comfortable accommodations and the sailing across the channel is beautiful. We saw porpoise and seals on our trip over and the sea was like a mirror. Our return trip was not quite as calm, but it was a pleasure on this jet boat. This service is not cheap, but it sure provides the opportunity to travel to a fun destination is probably less time than it takes to travel some of our freeways, and you are in a different world 28 miles across the sea.

I didn't feel herded at all; in fact, my fellow travelers and I felt very well tended-to.Only quibbles: standing in line at the Long Beach terminal is an ordeal, because there's no shade and you're expected to line up a half-hour or more before departure. Surely they can improve that. Also, the galley's selection of in-transit food and drink could have been a lot better (at least for the non-seasick-prone voyager).Took an expensive bicycle across this time, and the crew stored it in such a way that not a drop of saltwater got on it, coming or going!

My husband and I used Catalina Express during their Free B day ticket for my 30th. I called a few days before we were leaving not realizing that I should have made reservations. Glade I did because all that was left were the commodore seats for the time we wanted to depart. It was and extra $15 but we did get to board first, a free snack and a free drink, and there were less people in our area. The staff at the ticket counter were extremely helpful and friendly, and tried to complete our transaction as fast as possible. The crew on both of our boats to and from the island were friendly and seemed to want to make our experience a good one. The only thing that was a bit confusing was which dock we needed to line up at for our return boat leaving Catalina. However, the woman at the ticket window was very friendly. Although it is pricy to go to the island and back, it is a great day or weekend trip! great service from the staff here.",Michelle V
40,It's a good way of transportation,The crew is snobby and there isn't enough seats for all passangers. The cool part is that if it's your birthday you get a free boat ride to Catalina Island.,Yzabelle A
50,Fun,"Nice trip to Catalina Island. Excellent service! Even tough the trip is nice, the best await in the island. There is where the fun starts.",Itsia
50,Jet Cat...Is the fastest ship on the water!,"Service is the thing they do, so well. There is no better way to travel to Catalina Island. Take the Catalina Express from Long Beach Landing, fast, smooth and your there in less than an hour. Twice a year we go, and would not go any other way.",Robert H
50,Pleasant trip,The hour or so trip to Catalina was very pleasant. The boat was clean and the staff nice. It was a relaxing ride there and back. You have great views of Long Beach when near shore.,Moulder528
10,Impersonal without Consideration for the Physically Challenged,"I have a mobility issue which requires the use of an assisted walking device (aka, walker), but I'm also the mother of a small child who has mobility issues as well and often needs to sit or lie in a stroller, which doubles as a walker. Without the stroller functioning in a double capacity as a transporter for my child and a walker for me, we would be homebound. It's particularly crucial to have the stroller when my child is sleeping, as I cannot carry my sleeping child while I struggle to support my own self.Catalina Express, unfortunately, had a prior incident of a child falling out of a stroller on the way down the ramp and into the water when a parent lost control of the stroller, and since have required that children be removed from strollers before boarding and deboarding. What this meant for us was a dilemma and a delay with boarding. We were last to board and suffered the uncomfortable stares of everyone onboard wondering why the boat wasn't moving and en route as they wheeled me onto the boat in a wheelchair. As a crewmember attempted to wheel me over a mobile ramp to cross a threshold, he almost lost control and dumped me forward out of the wheelchair, which would have been hilarious if someone had a video camera on spot, but painful for me and my child. During that mishap, my footrest scraped the floor and twisted my ankle, while my child's foot got stuck in the wheel of the wheelchair. After arriving in Catalina, we were forgotten on board and just left there as they prepared to board travelers who were returning to Long Beach until finally a crewmember asked us why we were still there and I informed her I was waiting for a wheelchair.A couple of days later, as we prepared to board at Gate 1 for the return trip to Long Beach, I informed a crewmember of our special needs, and with an unpleasant sigh and look of distress, he did his best to disuade me from the use of a wheelchair to board as it would have been an inconvenience for him to retrieve a wheelchair from the Catalina landing. His persuasion was successful as I grew weary, standing in the hot sun with my child, and gave in which meant that I navigated the ramp to board by supporting myself on the railing, but not having any free limbs to support my child who was basically on their own. It took time, but we made it onboard and had difficulty, by that time, finding two seats together.The only positive about the return trip was that it was a different (upgraded or newer?) vessel with air conditioning and seemingly more comfortable seats, though they looked the same as on the first boat to Catalina. Due to improved ambiance, we were able to get some rest on the return trip.The crew was inexperienced and unprofessional and on behalf of my child and me, I felt like we were treated like 3rd-class garbage, when there are only two classes aboard, Commodore and General. I feel that Catalina Express needs to review their policies for assisting travelers who are physically challenged and train crewmembers to be sensitive to those needs. Otherwise and until that happens, I give them the lowest rating based upon our personal experience when using their service.",rebecca l
50,wonderful trip to and from the Catalina island,Fun and fast cruise to/from Catalina for the day. Sit outside and you will feel the wind and spray. If you are lucky like us you can see a group of blue wales in the area,sck1
50,The Catalina Express: Easy-Peasy!,"I love the Catalina Express. Watching the incoming passengers debark has an exotic, foreign flavor, almost like being at one of those small regional ferries around the world where locals and tourists carry anything and everything aboard: dive gear, groceries, luggage, cardboard boxes tied with string, dogs, and livestock. Well, no livestock on our trip!The Golden Shore location in Long Beach is a snap to find. Baggage drop-off and parking are simple and obvious. The ride is a smooth and comfortable sixty-five minutes, and they are fanatically on-time. We started out upstairs and outside on the top deck, but at a 5:45 PM departure time, it soon became unpleasantly cool. We waited until we passed the Queen Mary to go inside, where it was warm and cozy with great views.Purchasing tickets online was simple, thanks to a user-friendly and well thought-out website.And the fare was worth every penny. It may seem pricey to some, but who cares when you can literally bring almost anything (including your dog) and no one weighs your bag, hassles you about what you are carrying, or charges you extra for it? We hauled almost 100 pounds of dive gear and luggage. No problems, no hidden fees. It is just a fabulous part of the Catalina experience!A note to divers that haven’t been here before and are hauling gear: When you debark on Catalina, you can drop your dive gear off at the luggage depot inside on the pier, and they will deliver it to the Dive Park for you. They also pick it up at the end of each day. You retrieve it and pay (I think its 8$ per day per bag) right before you get back on the boat to go home.Another tip: get in line early to ensure your choice of seats.",FallsGirl0709

50,"Pricey for a day trip, but worth it.","The Catalina Express was a great way to get from Long Beach to Avalon. If you get sea sick make sure the take lots of medicine and bring ginger candy! There's a little snack bar on the boat where you can purchase snacks or drinks, which was nice. You cannot see anything but sky out of most of the windows. If you get sea sick, I recommend upgrading to the Commodore lounge and sitting outside up top. Get there a little earlier to get a good seat. The staff was not great and were talking loudly about inappropriate things on our ride back. I was so glad when we got to the dock!",Travelmas2
50,An excellent ferry to Santa Catalina,"I have given this ferry an excellent rating, as it did everything I expected of it. Debarked on-time, Arrived on-time, trip was quiet and uneventful. Anyone desiring to go to Santa Catlina from Long Beach should take this ferry.",PWHorstmann
40,Enjoyable,"The Catalina Express is pricey, but we really enjoyed our visit, so in the end, it was worth it. The boat is clean and the staff was friendly, but the ride was a bit choppy, so I recommend taking Dramamine.

Would love to go back to the Wrigley Memorial and Botanical Gardens, it's very pretty and peaceful.",ohriorio

The boat was fast, clean and the loading and unloading of passengers was obviously something they'd done a million times.

30,Pricey,"For two people expect to pay about $150 round trip - a little pricey I think for an hour boat ride one way. They seem to have a lot of staff on board, which I think is unnecessary. They could probably cut the staff in half and drop the ticket price considerably.",dojodan

50,Easy - Courteous - Comfy,"If you can afford it, take a helicopter or private yacht to Avalon, Santa Catalina Island, CA, otherwise you have little or no other option than taking the Catalina Express (fast public charter boat) departing from Long Beach, Dana Point, or San Diego across the channel. The ride is worth the price even if you don't stay on the island more than a day. Food and drink (including alcohol) are available onboard. The Catalina Express staff are easy-going, helpful and courteous, and they make your channel crossing a pleasure. For one day trips, take the earliest departure in the morning and catch the last in the evening. Bring/wear plenty of sunscreen. Catalina Express is highly recommended. A+",Dana S

50,Great trip,"Nothing wrong with this efficient carrier. Comfortable wide beam catamaran handles the 1 hour ride smoothly and safely. Even did a little whale watching along the way. Can go to either Avalon or Two Harbors. The latter is very small and only worth a visit if you want peace and quiet, a few buffalo and some nice hikes. Watch out for the schedules, as the routes and stops very day to day. Overall, a very good carrier. Well pleased.",lsutigre

40,From Long Beach to CI,"We chose to take the Catalina Island Ferry from Long Beach instead of the two other departure points. If this is your choice, I would recommend an overnight stay near the pier to make arrival easier in the morning, and another overnight if your cruise arrives back late.We chose a mid-morning cruise to allow time to arrive, and park, and wait inside for ticket validation. We reserved our tickets online prior (this is not mandatory, but is a good idea). Be careful to not overshoot the entrance to the ferry garage drive off of Golden Shore, as it is the last turn before driving over a long bridge and onto the huge and maze-like Long Beach Pier. The entrance was poorly marked and the sign was hidden behind an over-grown tree, so we took a free tour of the Long Beach Pier! If we had been running late, this would have been a disaster.The entrance to the garage did not look like we were in the right place, but eventually we were able to find parking on the free ramp near the marina building. Covered parking is available and is also free, on a first come basis.Many people use the ferry for commuting and packages and small suitcases, and even bicycles, are allowed on board.Food and drink service in provided on the ferry for an extra charge.The cruise takes about an hour, over open ocean, but it's not long enough or rough enough to worry about sea-sickness. Due to the fog, we did not see anything, but the sunlight coming diffused through the fog was warm. Don't forget the suntan oil, if you sit outside. It also can be quite windy out there, too. We sailed past the Queen Mary and the wooden sphere made to house the Spruce Goose, which is not in residence there anymore, on the way out of the harbor.On the return trip, we had reserved the last ferry out and it seemed to be running late. This may have been a problem as the island residents were loading in Long Beach after a day of some personal shopping. It was completely dark on the crossing coming back, and windy and cold, so we were glad to sit inside this time.A fun trip, a nice cruise and a fun way to arrive at CI!",Violette54

There are places to get some air and enjoy the ride outside, and there were many crew members prepared to assist should I have had any issues.

40,Great fun on my birthday,"Catalina Express offers a free round trip on your birthday; expires on 4/30/2012. ***The location of the Catalina Express Long Beach Landing Port has changed!!! It is no longer next to the Queen Mary. If you have taken the Catalina Express in the past, look at the map before you go. If you go to the wrong port, you might literally miss the boat***My husband and I spent the day in Catalina on my birthday. It's a shame, I have lived in Southern California since I was 12 years old and this is my first trip to Catalina. We had a very nice day. We went solely because of the free round trip. A round trip fare is $70. If you have a birthday between now and 4/30/2012, take advantage of this offer. When we checked in with Catalina Express, I was given a flyer listing places on the island that offer additional discounts on one's birthday. One such offer was parasailing for $20, but the boat for this vendor was being repaired and I wasn't able to take advantage of that offer.If you are planning to take an excursion on the island, I recommend reserving it in advance, especially if you will be there during the weekend. Many excursions sell out if you wait until you arrive. There are many excursions with varying prices available; some have deep discounts if you book in advance and ""bundle"" a few of them together.

50,Great Way to Travel to Catalina !!!,"Read so many great things about Catalina Express and they were so right !!! Very well organized from start to finish. We used the downtown Long Beach express. We booked a reservation in advance about one week for a preferred time and seating. They do however allow walk-on's if room is available..i'm sure during peak season it is really crowded and sold out but our rides were both partial filled. There is a check-in window and the very helpful staff explains what happens with tickets, boarding departure and arrivals. The waiting area prior to boarding has a bar and snack area and seating. There is public parking garage for your vehicle right across the street which allows overnight parking. They allow limited luggage and all your beach/diver/etc. gear (see website for particulars). Dogs have to be muzzled. We upgraded to the ""Commodore Level"" (extra $15 fee) which was very nice. You received preferential boarding. You also got a snack (cookie or nuts) and a drink (alcholic or non-alcholic). There was also a full bar for extras if you wanted them. The seating is spacious, air-conditioned with great views. You can sit inside or outside. Ride was rocky on the way out so some people got sea-sick. The staff was attentive and gracious. Conveniently located docking on Catalina Island. Walkable to ""downtown"" area of the bay. Ferry has numerous daily departure times so its easy for scheduling purposes to and from the island regarding your travel plans. On our return trip the next day the captain slowed the ferry down we were all able to get incredible pictures of the whales that were visible close by. Nice touch !!! Highly recommend. Bring a jacket at night it gets cool out on the water. Our weather day was great but if there are weather issues call them first for information regarding your ride. Their web-site is very user friendly, we booked the ferry to and from Catalina with no problems. Great way to get to Catalina !",AdvisorMember35
50,Best transportation to Catalina Island,"The shuttles run many times a day depending on the day you travel.The ride is fast and beautiful. There is a snack bar inside that also serves alcohol.The Sea can be rough even on a calm day so take drammamine if you get seasick.The boats are clean and spacious with seating both inside and out.Have a plan ""B"" in place incase the Harbour Master reports high swells. If this happens, which it did to us, you could be stuck in Long Beach over night.The Crew were all very friendly and attentive to the passengers during the trip, making sure everyone had their Sea legs and assisting us with getting from one area to another during the trip. They were also quick to respond to Sea Sickness with all the remedies and personal comfort. There was an older woman who was feeling sick, she basically had a personal nurse in one member of the Crew or another for the entire ride. I found their concern for the passengers genuine and everything you could hope for. What I see in this is that while most businesses are very understaffed currently nationwide, Catalina Express schedules Staff and Crew numbers according to passenger comfort.Start early, the Ocean is calmer before noon and if one shuttle is cancelled you have several more to try and catch.Book ahead, the shuttles do sell out.There is a helicopter service available, it is a beautiful and short ride but it is pretty spendy.",AlchemyDivine

Excellent customer service from shore to boat to shore and back. The snack bar staff and each of the crew looked like they loved their jobs.The ride was smooth. We chose to sit outside and soak up the sun and feel the breeze, The views are incredible when you approach Catalina Island and dock at Avalon. Then, if you return at night, the views of Long Beach and the colorful bridge, Queen Mary, etc. were stunning.We will definitely be doing this again.",ContractVoice
50,"Great boat, crew and views, and only one hour to the island","An easy one hour ride with lots of clean, comfortable seats, friendly and helpful crew, Passengers seem to get ""laid back"" after boarding, ready to enjoy the views and short trip to the island.Take a light jacket for mornings on the island, but indoor on the boat is comfortable.",WRR8
