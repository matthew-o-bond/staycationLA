50,Great park!,Great park! Easy with the kids and a stroller. Parking is also convenient. Lots of grass area to play as well as a nice park. Only downside is bathrooms. If you are potty training or have a toddler who is new to using the potty it may be a bit of a struggle.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srafiee
40,Unique pitch and putt and park,"We stopped here to walk our dog and were surprised that it is not just any old park with beautiful trees, but home to the Armand Hammer Pitch and Putt Golf Course! There is a playground in one corner, but the rest is dotted with 18, very short pitch and putt holes. There is even a clubhouse that rents cheap clubs, supposedly, but nobody was home. I think you'd have to be a skilled golfer to stay on task here. It wasn't crowded, but there were elderly folks being wheeled around, a dog chasing squirrels, and joggers scattered around like the leaf litter on the grass. It should prove a challenge, at least. There was a small greens fee, but nobody was there to collect it. We also noticed a couple of food van vendors, so lots of fun to be had. Bring your own clubs and practice first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonM373
40,Hidden gem,"As another reviewer noted, you wouldn’t find Holmby Park unless you were specifically looking for it — or, in our case, had been invited to a family birthday party being held there. Though the park itself is small, the playground area near its northern tip has plenty of tables and benches for putting out nibbles, drinks, balloons, and other goodies. No need to book, apparently — just turn up and be the first to bag the spaces. Otherwise, Holmby Park is a delightfully landscaped spot to stroll, jog, walk the dog, etc… surprisingly though, given its location in one of LA’s most exclusive and upscale locales, the public conveniences could do with some smartening-up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjbrown10
40,Very nice and semi private park.,"It is nestled in one of the most exclusive neighborhood in L.A. Adjacent to Los Angeles Country Club and has it own 9 hole pitch n putt golf course, lawn bowling, and playground.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4victorh
40,Hidden Park in Exclusive Area ...,You won't find Holmby Park unless you're specifically looking for it or you're in the Holmby Hills area admiring the mansions of the Rich and famous / infamous. It's a nice quiet green space abutting the LA Country Club (over the fence) and across from the former Spelling mansion / castle. Nice for a walk or for quiet time while breathing rerefied air of the area. ...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Gateway to gawking at amazing mansions,"This was our walking destination on the Sunday after we arrived. It’s was an easy walk from the hotel where we stayed, and a nice little park. On a Sunday morning, with record high temperatures, the park was busy with people walking their dogs and families with their children. But we continued past the park into the Holmby Hills residential neighborhood where we oogled the fabulous mansions located there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KriksPicks
50,"Free Parking, Friendly People, Food Trucks, Nice 3/4 Mile loop FUN","This is very small park but yet it can be everything from a good fitness track, BBQ outing, walking group meet-up, romantic walk. All types of people are here. There is also small playground for kids.No wild life and there is some interesting houses to see in the area. There is also a putting green.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdreynoldsjr
50,Where the locals go,"Walkers, card-players, sunners, everybody in the neighborhood seems to gather here. A lovely stroll tucked away like a cherished secret.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture802678
