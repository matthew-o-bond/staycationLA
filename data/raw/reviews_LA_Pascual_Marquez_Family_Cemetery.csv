20,I wouldn't bother.,"I don't even think you can enter without someone to unlock the gate for you. It's of slight interest to those of us who live in the neighborhood and the children from the local elementary school always go on a tour there, but if you are from out of town..it would be greatly disappointing .",airbrush1212
50,Honoring the family that dates back before Santa Monica became a city...,"Even though this area is outside the boundaries of the city of Santa Monica, this place is sacred to the family that has the longest history in the Boca de Santa Monica. The garden on the outside of the cemetery is lovely and even though I was only able to stand outside the gate, it was an honor to pay my respects. If you want to stand in a place that dates back to before California became a state and is still owned by the same family, this is it. This is in a residential area, so it was easy to remain quiet and respectful. I hope to return again.",Sabrina N
