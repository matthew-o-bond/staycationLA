30,Wedding at the Greystone,"What a beautiful historic Mansion! From pictures that were reviewed of previous Weddings were absolutely stunning.....But....this venue belongs to Parks Dept and during a most recent Wedding, there were tourists visiting the Mansion! And their photo bombs are clearly in the background of some very formal pictures during the ceremony. Really? How is it possible that the Bride and Groom pay a whole lot of money to have a Fairy Tale Wedding, pay a Wedding Planner a whole lot of money, pay a Florist and catering Service a whole lot of money and these photo bombers cannot be controlled?All these Services ""highly recommended by this Venue."" They have park Rangers standing at the top of the stairs where the reception is taking place and yet, a guest with Cancer climbing the stairs while her husband went to get the car, as she is ascending-almost to the top she feels vertigo and had it not been for another observant Wedding guest, who ran up the stairs 2-3 at a time to catch her, she would have surely fallen down the stairs and probably died. Why weren't these 2 Park Rangers standing 4 feet away on top of this? Smokey the Bear would shake his head at their behavior.Bathrooms are so far away from the Wedding and reception area, that it is quite the hike and very scary at the thought of anyone walking all that way ALONE. With so many other beautiful locations in California; without traffic issues, beautiful Ocean back drops...do your homework and hopefully read the reviews.",Liz94588

40,How the other half lives,It’s fun to drive around Beverly Hills and try to catch a glimpse of the posh estates. Greystones was built for the Doheny family and its nestled in a hill overlooking Beverly Hills and LA beyond. You can go there without reservations or anything and just wander around the gardens. The mansion itself you cannot enter except for special events and on certain days when it is open for a tour which alas was not the day we were there. It’s nice to see the grounds though and feel like your really getting a glimpse of those other nearby homes which you can’t enter. Worth it for an hour or so.,Nidia L
50,The Teapot Dome Scandal Comes Alive,"Beautiful grounds for this storied location. The grounds are a city park and free to see during daylight hours.

50,Hauntingly Beautiful,"The grounds are beautiful. The mansion is 46,000 sq.ft. and was built back in the 1920's. It's what is known as a passive park. Here to walk and enjoy the sites. This mansion was known as the Hearst castle of Southern California in its day. Very impressive. There are tours in winter time. Too many events during the spring/summer/fall. The history is awesome. The park itself is awesome and the spirits that STILL reside on this property are awesome. Yes, it is haunted and active with ""ghosts."" How do I know? I've worked here for 20 years. Enjoy.",Clete Keith
50,"Pretty, nice for a wander","We popped by and wandered around the gardens for about 30 minutes. You get a great view of LA from there, and it’s free to visit and to park. It’s also super close to Rodeo Drive so we combined the two. Unfortunately, the house itself was closed for an event.",ZaaaRN
40,Beautiful setting but not much to see,"We walked around the exterior of the mansion and enjoyed exploring the grounds. There isn't a lot to see or do but if you are interested in old mansions or movie/TV locations it's worth visiting. You can't go inside unless there is a special event. However, you can park and look at the exterior for free.",Lisa G
40,Great to see in such a prestigious area,"All the massive mansions in this part of the world are off limits so having this place available for everyone to see is quite awesome. You are not allowed inside however you can see from the windows. Usually this place is available for weddings and functions. The gardens and walking around this place is truly wonderful, with great views overlooking the city. Parking is above the mansion and you walk down through various garden paths.",Aussie_2012
20,The Rooms are Empty! Not Worth the Price!,"We went this afternoon for an ""Event"" (fundraiser)... the signs posted clearly state ""No Photography"" so I left my camera in the car.... Yes, there is photography, but not for commercial purposes! :(We paid $20 each, there was a free shuttle, but there were no signs indicating that, but on the way back, the shuttle driver noticed us & stopped, reversed the van & opened the door for us (What a GREAT Man, I wish I had gotten his name).There wasn't a proper tour guide & many of the docents were too busy to speak w/ us, unless we approached them.For $20 we didn't even get a bottle of water, but they were selling it at the entrance for $1.00!The rooms are EMPTY except for a piano in one & 2 beds in another.... But there were photographs of the 1920's & 1940's in many of the rooms and then some sort of poster showing which film(s) if ant the rooms were used in!The pool was filled & bricked in, one had to guess that's what the area once was and the lawn below, who knows what that was for? Lack of signage.The bowling alley & billiards room w/ hidden bar was interesting & the Bathrooms were the highlights.I don't think I'd go there again!",Auntie-Nanuuq
40,"Beautiful, But No Pics","Drug the family here to save money. To see the outside, this is free, and you don’t have to pay for parking. I liked it, but everyone else was not impressed.

50,Always a delight,"I have visited here just to tour the outside property and also for special events that have been held inside. This is a wonderful place and you can picture what it would have been like to be the 1% in days gone by. So impressive, such a tragic story.

50,Beautiful gardens and grounds with a lovely view,I read about Greystone when planning a trip to the Hollywood area. The grounds and gardens surrounding the mansion are so beautiful and peaceful.

40,Was a nice place to find peace in LA,"Got up early and decided to drive around Beverly Hills. The Park opens at 10 am, so decided to stop in. The grounds are beautiful, and you can get some nice views of downtown LA on a clear day like I had. The mansion was closed for a private event, but you still can wander the grounds. What was once the largest house in LA is now dwarfed by many of its neighbors, but there are 18 acres for you to explore here. Staff were very friendly.",jfm02719
40,Gorgeous Home,"I visited on a day the house was open to the public. I purchased the ticket well in advance from the Friends of Greystone Mansion website. It was $20 for a self guided tour and the house is open from 11 to 2:30. Guided tours are not an option for this event. When we arrived the parking lot was already full so we had to park on the street and walk up a short but steep hill. When we got to to the house it wasn't exactly obvious where the entrance was and there were no signs pointing to it. It was a bit confusing because there was a shuttle stop but we didn't know if the shuttle took you TO the entrance or to the parking lot we didn't know was there but had read about. It turned out to be the parking lot. We eventually did find the entrance, signed in and headed inside. The volunteers were very nice but many (not all) were not really knowledgeable about the house unfortunately. I asked one where I could find a particular room and she had no idea. The house is not furnished so if you're expecting that be advised beforehand- it is not. It's still beautiful though and I'm really glad I went. Totally worth it. There are public bathrooms and a water fountain just outside the home but not much else. We were there on a warm day and I wish I'd brought some water with me!",Brenda G
50,Perfect place to relax in the city,Greystone manor is magical it is like an old castle on the endge of Beverly Hills. It’s open to the public and hosts events and weddings.

50,Worth a side trip,First off just driving in the neighborhood of uber rich Beverly Hills is an experience in how the 1% lives. The Mansion grounds are beautiful and well worth the visit. Very cold when I was there but a nice place for a picnic.The house is only open rarely for tours- I was not passing through at that time.,Fearlessmsla
30,Short visit,"We visited Greystone as we were in the area, we went on a weekday and it was absolutely empty! It was nice to walk round the house and gardens but it doesn’t take too long - only about 30 minutes so I wouldn’t come out of your way to visit this. We had a nice walk to Beverly Hills afterwards on a sunny day and that was enjoyable looking at the neighbourhoods etc. I would visit IF in the area and have some time to spare and that would probably be it.",TML

30,Greystone.......a dissapointment,"The Greytone Mansion itself is open to the public only a few times a year. I had looked forward to my visit. However I was very disappointed. The mansion is not furnished. I would say the main draw would be touring the home if you are a movie buff. Many movies,TV and commercials have been filmed inside the mansion. Storyboards are in the rooms showing the location of the movie scene. I have visited many historic house museum mansions with opulent gardens and this certainly was not the case for Doheny Greystone Mansion. The Greystone website says “formal English gardens” however the allee’ was the only outside space with some charm. All docents should be given a syllabus to test their knowledge of the home’s history. I asked several basic questions and they had no idea what I was referring to as to the history of the home. There was nothing special to say about the gardens...in fact it looked like the landscaping had not been tended to in some time with dead vegetation all around. I would think the City of Beverly Hills could do a much better job in promoting this potentially wonderful home.",Claudia R

Not to worry.Wish you more success and clarity with your visit",Harrison F. Carter
50,Google the story!!,"Absolutely loved this place! What a fascinating back story. A must- see in LA. If you like history, bring walking shoes, wear sunscreen and drive up! So sad the actual house is not open to the public, I’m sure they would make tons of money. Be sure to bring drinking water, and pace yourself. Expect to spend about 2 hours here.

50,One of the True Gems of Beverly Hills,"We lucked out by being in LA when Greystone had an inside tour of the mansion. It was self guided, and the experience of being inside and able to go through all the rooms was so special.Beautiful day made the grounds gleam and the views were stunning.Everyone was very friendly. It was an honor to get access to such a notable house, and one that is so famous. Stills from the many movies shot here were on display in each room. It's amazing how a few changes in furnishings and lighting can transform a room into a completely different setting. My introduction to Greystone was with the 1991 NBC Dark Shadows, so it was especially neat to see the actual location as bright and cheerful as could be.Love the vibes I got here. Peace and tranquility overlooking the city like an oasis amidst the all the bustle and traffic.The locals are so lucky to have this park to enjoy. Definitely put on your must see list!",BJr970
50,Traveling Great Britain's Countryside without leaving Los Angeles,What I enjoy about going to Greystone Mansion and Park is that it is a place I can psychologically relax after an intense office day or week. Both the outdoor gardens and the Mansion psychologically invite people to explore and visit a world that is quickly vanishing. The outdoor gardens vast size allow me to mentally breathe.,Julie O
50,Beautiful environment,The gardens and mansion are beautiful with many special events going on. I have been to several and they are very well planned and informative. I highly recommend wandering through the gardens.,millershelleya

We were a little too early for things to be blooming, you can see them getting ready being the early March. The stone work is just beautiful and its in many shows and movies so its fun to walk the grounds and see if you cant see what pieces they use in your favorite ones. Just plain beautiful!! Enjoy and walk and its free parking too. The hours are limited though. Clean bathrooms also, but are slippery when wet, we saw a few people go down. We walked all sides of the mansion that were open and not roped off including the garden area.",Breanne07

50,Two-thumbs up for bringing this intriguing family home and history to life.,"Greystone Mansion, located on a hillside of Beverly Hills, was built and owned by one of the richest oil tycoons America has ever had, Edward L. Doheny, the first man to sink an oil well in Los Angeles. The mansion was gifted to his son, “Ned” Doheny and his wife Lucy, on their wedding day, and they and their five children lived there beginning in 1928.Having already taken the tour of the father’s homestead, the Doheny Mansion located in the Los Angeles West Adams district, it was a natural progression to further explore the history of the family by taking the tour of their second home, Greystone Mansion. The Tudor residence, comprised of fifty-five rooms, was originally set on 400 acres of the Doheny Ranch, but the grounds and family went through many changes.The family had a troubling and tragic history. First, there was the politically sensational Teapot Dome Scandal beginning in 1921, where Edward Doheny was accused with Albert Hall, the Secretary of the Interior, of bribery, having leased the Navy petroleum reserves to private oil companies at low rates without competitors bidding. It was a loan from Doheny to Hall of $100,000 that made it illegal. Criminal and civil law suites ensued, which eventually found Fall guilty and he went to jail. Doheny was acquitted, but his reputation never regained the heights it had gained. Then in 1929, there was the murder of his son, Ned Doheny, and the suicide of Ned’s secretary, Hugh Planket. The truth of the crime has never been fully explained, and to this day the truth remains a mystery.Ned’s wife Lucy and the children, remained in the house. She remarried and remained in the house for twenty more years, until she decided to move and sell the grounds to Paul Trousdale to develop Trousdale Estates and the mansion to Henry Crown, a Chicago industrialist. In 1965, the city of Beverly Hills purchased the mansion, saving it from demolition, and put in a 19-million gallon water tank, which rests under the present parking lot above the house.Since 1971, the city has restored the park and house for the public and the mansion became the fourth local historic landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. The park gardens and grounds are free and open from 10:00 to 5:00 or 6:00, depending upon the time of year. Tours of the mansion are only held on the first Saturday from December through April, and reservations must be made ahead of time. Additional special events are held throughout the year and the gardens can be rented for weddings.We took the tour last December of the house and grounds and were thoroughly impressed with the entire property, as well as the knowledge of the rangers who led the tours. The house has a mixture of Gothic and neoclassic architecture, and fine craftsmanship shows over the entire building; from the oak banisters, carved rafters, stately fireplaces, inlaid marble floors, and musician’s balcony, to an expansive kitchen, multiple servant’s quarters, and family bedrooms with incredible southern views of Los Angeles, all the way to the Pacific Ocean. We also visited the movie-theater, billiard room with hidden bar, and the basement bowling alley. The only surprising thing is that the house is vacant of any furniture.It was on the tour that we discovered that there is a play performed in the mansion called, The Manor, presented for only two weeks in the early part of the year. Having become completely enthralled with the history of the family, we booked for one of their presentations in January. The play opens in the living room where the family is celebrating the wedding of Ned and Lucy, and then the audience divides up and is taken to different rooms, where the dramatic story of the family unfolds, until its tragic event at the end. Stage furniture was moved in, which finally gave a more lived-in feel. The actors were excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed the entire production, giving us a particularly unique and rewarding conclusion to our exploration into this historic LA family. Two-thumbs up for bringing this intriguing family home and history to life.",Lita-Luise C

50,"Ray Charles, Bruce Springsteen and Greystone Demonstration Garden","September 24, 2017 is a glorious, golden, California day. I am celebrating Bruce Springsteen and Ray Charles birthday (9/23). To pay tribute I jump into my jeep and in the words of Ray Charles, “Hit the Road Jack.”Destination: Greystone Mansion Demonstration Garden to attend my friend and client, George Pessin’s Master Gardener lecture. Through a partnership with Beverly Hills Park and Recreation and the UC Cooperative Extension George teaches a 4-week introductory class at Greystone twice a year (Spring and Fall) on how to grow fruits and vegetables in your own backyard. I follow the words of the Boss, Bruce Springsteen, “From Small Things Big Things One Day Grow”.I arrive at Greystone Mansion Park, take a long walk thru a bucolic landscape surrounded by trees, flowers, gardens and gorgeous lawns (this beautiful park is free and open to the public). I wind up under an awning (good for a hot day) while George spins his magic. The talk is well beyond any I expected. Topics range from garden tools, to nutrition, to soil structure and organic fertilizers. Not bad for a morning’s leisure. He takes many animated questions including one from me, in which he informs me that tomatoes and squash are actually fruits because of the way they carry their seeds.I sit, listen, watch and wonder why the rest of the world does not understand the value of peace, tranquility and eating well with edible fruits and vegetables from home gardens. George says the mission of his class is for participants to be able to harvest fresh fruits and vegetables every day. With our glorious Southern California weather it is certainly possible.My main thought though as I sit under the blue, California sky with light winds and fragrant scents wafting by is from the Dali Lama, “If you want to improve the world, plant a garden”.",Gary W

There's a few little walks, restrooms, and a parking lot. A couple water features are fine, but mostly it's paved paths and some mostly run-down grounds.

40,Beautiful manor house and grounds free entry and parking,This is a great free park on the grounds of the large estate. Owned and operated by the city there is a large parking lot free for all visitors.,JKPImageFusion
40,Worth a quick stop to see how the wealthy lived,"Ah, to be rich in the era of no income tax! A lovely mansion and garden built by one of LA's early millionaires. Has a large free parking area and no admission charge, which is rare in this part of town. Nicely landscaped and beautiful views.",Marblehead750
50,Concours d'Elegance,"You park on Sunset Blvd. and get efficiently shuttled to and from the event--a delicious variety of antique classic cars. About 150 beautiful vehicles. Nowhere near the caliber of the Pebble Beach concours, but still very, very enjoyable.You park on Sunset Blvd. and get efficiently shuttled to and from the mansion.The best part was the free food & drink. Great BBQ, kale salad, beer, tequila, and vodka. All included in the price of admission.Don't waste your time trying to get coffee--I'm pretty sure the same people who were in line for coffee when we got there were still in line when we left at the end of the day.There is just one coffee truck but there are several food and booze purveyors (all free of charge!), so no need to stand in a long line.Try to stake out a place to sit before lunch, the grounds are huge so it's worth it to look around to possibly find a place to sit. If there's nothing up top where the cars are, try the lower level.One extra treat is that you also get to tour the Greystone mansion--I loved the secret prohibition bar.Bring a big shopping bag because you'll want to carry home free swag like beer glasses. Additionally, the shopping in the mansion is uncharacteristically (for Beverly Hills) reasonable--15 bucks for souvenir T-shirts and jewelry.",LBGrandBanks
40,Beautiful Surprise when driving through high-class neighborhoods,"We were driving around looking at mansion after mansion and stumbled across the Greystone Mansion and Park. Beautiful views (on a clear day), and interesting history. Will be fun trying to spot the mansion in the numerous movies filmed there. We have the Henry Ford Mansion in Michigan, which is comparable in size, grounds and view. It was fun to see another absurdly large mansion across the country. But one can't help but wonder why people would want to live in such a large residence. Location, location, location. The park was gorgeous. Views when built had to be jaw dropping; now they're of the wow factor. Both were worth the stop.",TwinCreek
40,Pretty and Interesting,Greystone Mansion has been used in something like 50 movies and tv shows so there's a definite chance you'll recognize this place when you get there. The grounds are pretty and the history is interesting. It's free to walk about and take in the views and never crowded. This place is small for a 'park' so don't expect to spend a day here. Come check it out and be on your way.The only way to tour the inside is to book well in advance with the city of Beverly Hills or go see some kind of murder mystery play that is put on here certain times a year. This review is just for the grounds/park.,Sara L
50,"Saw ""THE MANOR HOUSE"" performed","Theater 40's ""MANOR HOUSE"" history play about the family that owned the mansion originally was a great way to tour the gorgeous building. Highly recommended",melaniechartoff
40,Hidden Gem,"On a couple previous visits and having been on the Stars homes tour, I was told that you could visit the exterior of the mansion for free. So when I was travelling with a friend and we had a car, I thought it was the perfect opportunity to walk around a Beverly Hills mansion. Also this is where batman lives in the movies!It's a beautiful place to visit. Big carpark for visitors. Amazing gardens and lovely to walk around this large beautiful mansion. Amazing views! Some some beautiful amazing other mansions nearby. It's probably the only Beverly Hills mansion you will get this close to. Really a hidden gem.",Ero40
50,a hidden beauty,"I took a uber taxi to the park. It was filled with flowers, trees and of course, the VIEW! A good walking area if you stay near Beverly Hills. It was a nice time like unexpected spring breeze",mingwingsing
50,Here Comes the Sun: Greystone Demonstration Garden,"In the words of Beatle George Harrison, “Little Darling its been a long, cold lonely winter… (but) Here Comes the Sun. It is Sunday afternoon and I’m at the Beverly Hills Greystone Mansion Park (a too-well kept secret).The Mansion was originally built in 1927 by Edward “Ned” Doheny, Jr. son of Edward Doheny Sr. who with this friend Charles Canfield were the first to strike oil in Los Angeles.The City of Beverly Hills purchased this magnificent Mediterranean mansion/property in 1965 and formerly dedicated it as a public park in 1971 enabling citizens countywide to enjoy the 18 acres of South of France/Tuscany inspired gardens.Enter George Pessin, one of my oldest friends and a man of many talents. Not only does he publish my books and manage my website but he is also a Master Gardener, painter, photographer, and gourmet chef. Many years ago, he started an urban garden in Los Angeles behind the now closed restaurant, Alto Palato, on La Cienega. This empty city lot was transformed into a lush oasis of fruits and vegetables with 8-foot tall multi-colored sunflowers surrounding the perimeter.Now many years later, George is a certified LA County Master Gardener with a fascinating passion to develop inner city gardens so Angelenos can “grow and eat their own food.”We visit Greystone on a sunny Sunday (quite a relief after the long rainy LA winter) so George can show me the demonstration garden where he teaches his “victory garden” classes. The 4-session series is given through a partnership of Beverly Hills Park and Recreation and the University of California Cooperative Extension.His passion for food and gardens are now available for all those who wish to learn to grow their own food. The Dali Lama once said, ""if you want to improve the world, plant a garden."" George has now one-upped the Dali Lama with his version, which includes using the food raised as medicine for the body and the gardening as an elixir for the soul.In this age of rancor, chaos and turmoil, what a pleasure it is to sit in a garden in the sun overlooking the glorious LA Skyline and realize the Beatles (and George Harrison) got it right, “Strawberry Fields Forever.”As John Lennon aptly put it, “Life is what happens to you while you are busy making other plans.” So disconnect your cell phone, get off the grid and come visit Greystone Mansion Park. And if you are so inclined, bring a good book, the quiet peacefulness will do you some good.",Gary W
50,Make sure to book a ranger tour well in advance,"The tour was great, rangers were great, place was super amazing!A bit cumbersome to book a tour, but well worth it. You need to register first with city of BH, and then book the tour, which has very limited showings. Only once a month, on a Saturday, and only during off-wedding season, which is Los Angeles is pretty long.The rangers will give you a very comprehensive tour of the grounds, tell you the history of the house and the Doheny Family, and the many scandals, deaths, & ghostly stories.Its a great way to see how the other 1% lived at one time.",lmorodomi
30,cool grounds,"but that's about it. there isn't much in the way of signage to help yourself to a self guided tour. if you want to see the joint you have to arrange a private tour in advance. It's a killer view of LA but, without the paid tour not worth the stop.",Jim I

40,Feel of living in Beverly hills,"This is probably the only free attraction to do in upscale Beverly hills. I didn't know about it, but a friend living in LA advised.It's a terrific mansion with beautiful gardens belonging to the city, open to public (only the gardens, you cannot tour the house). There's a free parking and free toilets. Touring the gardens is on your own with a grand finale at a beautiful terrace with outstanding LA city views.",B1714D

40,Would be an amazing spot for a wedding,"I have only seen a little less than a dozen movies made here and cannot even recall the Mansion in the movies. If you have seen the majority of the movies on their list, a visit here may have a lot more meaning/value for you.It is very beautiful and scenic so I’m glad we stopped here to visit. Other than the gorgeous views of L.A., or taking beautiful scenic photos, I cannot imagine spending much time here. The Mansion itself is not open to tours. It’s not a place I could see visiting more than once. Would be an amazing spot for a wedding however.Clean restrooms!",Dani B
50,Free in Beverly Hills??,"This is a great location to stop by. You get the wonderful view of LA. Walking the ground, you almost feel like you are not the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, but more of a relax feeling of country side manor. It is a beautiful visit and best that it is free. It will be worth your time. Lots of photo ops.",TahitiMom
50,Class and elegance,"On a beautiful day in southern California there is no better place to be, besides the beach, than Greystone. Take a blanket for a picnic and enjoy the grounds. Or stare over the city off in the distance for amazing views of LA.This is totally free of charge and a must stop location on a West LA tour or weekend activity.",R2R
50,Taste of Beverly Hills History,One of the best ways to experience Beverly Hills history and get a taste of life in the last 100 years in the area. This is amazing architecture and the grounds are stunning. I was fortunate enough to go here one time for the Decorator Showcase gala and I loved it.,Catherine B
40,Beautiful estate and park!,When in Beverly Hills we wanted to check this out. Beautiful mansion and grounds. Lots of beautiful views of LA. Really cool step back in LA history. Wish we could have gone inside. I guess Ozzy's mansion is the white one near by. Worth checking out.,ironleague
40,"A lovely, limited place to spend an hour","The Greystone Mansion has been the backdrop for a number of movies (you'll see the list on an announcement board on the edge of the parking lot). It's a stunning mansion and grounds, especially on a clear day where you can see downtown Los Angeles in the distance. Unless you're there for an event, the mansion is closed, but you can take a peak inside and certainly tour the grounds and admire the classic architecture. It's obviously a step back in time to a gilded age. NOTE: The parking lot gates close at 5pm and you must be out by then. There's often movies being shot at the site, so your access maybe limited in some respects.",ARLVAGUY

50,Must see!,"Up high in Beverly Hills, the Greystone Mansion will bring out your inner fairy tale. It is absolutely beautiful, and will make your child dreams come true.

30,Only if you're in the neighbourhood,"As we were driving through Beverly Hills, we checked out Greystone Mansion and its gardens. The place is relaxing, you can take a stroll through the gardens and enjoy a the view on LA. All in all, a tad underwhelming, I only recommend going there if you are in the neighbourhood.

50,Great wedding venue,We attended a wedding on a hot summer day in July at greystone mansion. What a cute little spot tucked away from the hustle bustle of LA. The only down side I would say about this venue was that they did not allow any sort of booth or umbrella set up - all the guests were roasting under the sun for nearly 2 hours with 99F temperature!!!,Kay K
40,Wonderful way to spend an afternoon,The Greystone Mansion is beautiful inside and out. The house was impressive to say the least and the grounds were meticulously well kept. My husband and I spent hours exploring the different areas and taking in the views.,Merci
50,Beverly Hills castle,"On our most recent trip we took our 3 year old grandson to see the ""castle"". This large estate was the Doheny family's home. There is a murder mystery tour that goes through the house. In the summer there is a drama camp that the city runs using the lovely gardens and courtyards and fountains. Our little guy was very happy running around all the water features. You can get a lovely view of the city from the very large parking lot. Beverly Hills has several events a year here. The house itself is not open every day but we enjoyed ourselves very much just meandering through the various levels of the grounds. There is no fee for Greystone Mansion. There is a restroom available on the side of the building.",wilywizard
40,Adventurous feat!,"I went to the place on public transport. It was not an easy journey since I came from San Gabriel. Took bus #76, alight at 1st and broadway. It was a challenge looking for the bus stop for bus#2/302 so I took the train to hollywood/highland. The bus stop for bus#2/302 along sunset avenue is not so famous should you ask around hollywood walk of fame area. So, once you get off the train take the road away from hollywood ave going to Ihop resto along sunset. I get off at sunset/alta and used google map to direct me to the place. A good hearted man gave me direction too. The road is so nice with trees in both side. There is a sign pointing going up to the park. The view from the top overlooking LA is so beautiful. The architecture of the mansion is impressive. The details of the landscap will bring you to an illusion you are a wealthy person and you own the place. I'm impressed with the details of the garde.",enabatar
30,Just Average,"The views were nice, and the building exterior and gardens were very nice but we could not get into the building anywhere and there are no signs or information available on-site. There were plenty of than telling you what you cant do(Including taking pictures??). Maybe we went there when it was closed? It was mid-day on Saturday? I read about the history of the place on my phone as I walked around.",bartpic
40,Beautiful stonework in the gardens and easy to visit.,The most impressive part of visiting these gardens is not the plantings as they are minimal except for a nice alley of cedars.The stone work of the gardens and paths is what is impressive and the views of the main house too. Given the water shortage its understandable that the gardens are minimal but its too bad as the weather would support amazing plantings.,sport5travel
30,Afternoon visit,Nice stop during a visit to Los Angeles. I misread the website and thought there was access to tour the mansion as well but daily visitors only have access to walk around the property and park-like setting. It is a beautiful property and provides a some beautiful views of Los Angeles. This is a good afternoon stop while doing other site seeing in the area.,Jennifer A

If you have the opportunity to go you should it's absolutely stunning .",Pubert A
40,Beautiful Grounds and a Glimpse into the Past,"While in Beverly Hills, take be sure and take 30 minutes or so to walk the grounds of the Greystone Mansion. This home and the grounds offer a great glimpse into the Roaring 20's in Los Angeles.You are not allowed into the home, just around the grounds, though you can peek into the windows of the home and see some of the great rooms, stairs, etc. Be sure to make sure the grounds are open as they close on occasion for filming or other events. Parking is free. Also, be mindful that there are stairs and some steep climbs in places.",David P
50,Great park and house,"We visited as a part of our private Hollywood tour. It was very interesting to learn about the house and its origins in LA's oil past. Likewise it was interesting to understand how the city came to buy it for a reservoir. Beautiful, big house with an amazing view of the commercial area around Beverly Hills makes this a great venue to visit. We really enjoyed the view and the history of the house.",Grover R
50,Historical Greysone Mansion,This Mansion was owned by the Doheny Family and there was a murder there.So many films are made there and it is truly a wonderful place to visit. Even if you can go inside the Mansion the view is unbelievable and besides from the beautiful City of Beverly Hills you can see the all the way to the ocean on a clear day.,DeniseCohenGershon
40,Deer in the Middle of a Concrete Jungle,"What can I say -- I was so surprised to see a Deer and her fawn during my visit to the Greystone Mansion. And that about says it all. The place is peaceful, and the architecture makes you see the Beverly Hills of yester-years. It is a great place to visit and walk-about. Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy the surroundings.",Shelley K

50,Extremely recommended!,"It’s been a year since I’ve been living in Los Angeles when I found myself a place for privacy, walking and book reading – Greystone Mansion Park. It is located in the very heart of Beverly Hills at the 905 Loma Vista Drive, BH, CA 90120. The entry in the park is absolutely free and, the most important, they have a huge parking lot.Apparently, there are only few people who know about this place, I come here quite often and, until now, not even once I saw groups of tourists. I recommend it to all, as a compulsory program.",Girlintheuniverse
50,Beautiful Serene Park,What a beautiful setting. Wow. The Mansion and Park are absolutely beautiful and worth visiting and taking photos. Many movies were shot on this breath taking location and the photo opps are plentiful. Definitely worth the trip.,Jerry K
40,Stunning gardens and views...,A chance to see what's behind those Beverly Hills hedges and gates! A beautiful historic home in the hills of Beverly Hills.

40,"Cool location and grounds, wish we could have seen inside",Took my two girls (9 & 13) here while vacationing in LA. It was a lot of fun for us to wander around the grounds of this mansion. You seriously could get lost here! It was a great free activity that is worth the drive.,Angie H

30,"Beautiful Gardens, Very Restricted - Photographs Allowed by Permit","With the help of Trip Advisor, I try to add interesting sites to see when we revisit cities. Sometimes I miss the mark on the ""interesting"" component. Here, my husband sat down on a bench and read the news - yes, Greystone was that boring. Greystone Mansion should be named Greystone Gardens. Beautiful gardens, but not colorful in March, surround the mansion. Making your trek by vehicle, trolley, or walking you expect to see this magnificent mansion atop the hills overlooking the vast, landscape of the congested, rhythm of L.A. For me, camera-ready with my “real camera” the anticipation of this experience was quelled with the “Photos – By Permit Only” sign. I am accustomed to very fine print, but I missed this on my research. To be candid, there isn't really anything to photograph. The lack of access to the indoor mansion is understandable – funding must be a problem for the City of Beverly Hills. Having visited many mansions such as Hearst Castle, the Newport Mansions, Ringling's Mansion in Sarasota the lack of indoor access is somewhat odd since there are no furnishings for visitors to soil or destroy, at least none visible to the peeping-tom visitors peering through lead glass windows.I had TripAdvised and Googled Greystone, perused the website, and thought I was ready. Beautiful estate, now Greystone is owned by the City of Beverly Hills. Views of the L.A. skyline (not panoramic views), the gardens, Lilly ponds, fountains are beautiful and carefully maintained. Funding or the convenience of a lack of funding results in this site being another little garden to see but not photograph ""without a permit."" This disappointment, may work to the benefit of Beverly Hills, as fewer visitors result in fewer employees needed and lower revenues as people would pay to see inside. Or perhaps, visitors would not pay an admission fee to the mansion since it appears empty. Still, this is a beautiful venue for weddings and other local events. Restrooms are available, while food is not available for purchase.Other prohibited activities in addition to ""photography without a permit"" included: picnicking, exercising (jogging)), pets, electronic microphones, any sports or bike riding, smoking. The only activities within the rules were walking, climbing steps, sitting, looking, seeing, cell phones (I guess). Several were taking photos with their cell phones. Anyway, I seized my husband's cell phone and took several photos, until I channeled my inner rebel and pulled my camera out of its bag. Triumphant, I was cautious not to disturb anyone or anything. At the end of the day, Greystone was both the most majestic and disappointing site on this L.A. visit. We survived our disappointment even though my husband was ready to leave when he saw the photography sign (my only reason to see the mansion). if you’re trying to use up some extra time, this is not the place. Instead, see the many other sites in L.A. for educational/historical experiences, better panoramic L.A. and ocean views you can enjoy and photograph.",RikiUSA

The play at the Greystone Mansion is a somewhat fictionalized account of murders that took place there in 1929, Guests travel to several rooms and watch the actors tell the story. The audience is divided into three groups that travel in a few rooms in the mansion. The actors are excellent and it's a fun evening. I wish I could have seen more of the grounds. I will return there to do that.",Barbara P
40,Gorgeous grounds!,"Greystone Mansion and Park is free for parking and lovely views of Los Angeles on a clear day. I have been to several weddings here, and have learned from the Ranger some history behind it. The property also has Ranger tours which are informative and $15 PP. Not bad for the amount of time spent and the detail you get on the architecture and ""behind the scenes"" of the family. There is no gift shop on site, but you can order any items online. The mansion hosts murder mystery dinners (so much fun!) and they also have musicians perform live (classical music mainly). We will definitely come back and visit next time we are in LA!",TrvlnDixie45
40,Very Beautiful Venue for a Wedding,"We attended the wedding of a friend of ours and it was such a beautiful setting. The wedding itself was in the courtyard on the back side, and how beautiful of a setting. We then adjourned for cocktails on the patio overlooking Los Angeles, then to the inner courtyards for dinner and dancing. The only drawback was that it was a January wedding, so it was quite cold for outdoors. Other than the weather, which no one can control, we thought the setting was so memorable for a young couple to start their journey in life.",mcchuck2014

We booked rooms at a Beverly Hills hotel and dinner at a restaurant and then looked for something to do during the afternoon besides shopping. Despite the fact that we are all long-time Angelenos, none of us had heard of Greystone. I found it on the internet and we decided to visit.It turns out to be a mansion built by the Doheny family in the Hollywood Hills. Although the interior is not open to the public, we visited the extensive and amazing grounds, with elaborate landscaping, trails opening into beautiful separate areas, and, from many locations, incredible views over the entire Los Angeles basin. From the terrace of the mansion itself, we could see from far beyond downtown around to the collection of high rises along the coast in Santa Monica.A spectacular view worth the visit.The structure was apparently build in the 1920s and is itself quite interesting.All of us enjoyed the visit immensely, especially given the price, which was free.Might not be that interesting to children, but adults should find the visit well worth it.",Charles G
30,Walk around an Old House,The outside of the Tudor revival mansion and surrounding gardens in Beverely Hills is OK...and it is free...but the only glimpse you are going to get of the inside of the house is through the odd window. The home is grand and at one time was the largest mansion built in the hills. The rooms are empty and the attraction is now owned by the city of Los Angeles. It's a great place to take pictures but don't bring your 4 legged friends-they are NOT ALLOWED.,William M

Do note the amazing cowhide ""inlaid"" area rug in Mrs. D's room.The solarium on the first floor was beautiful done.

50,See something different in Beverly Hills,"The beautiful and historic Greystone Mansion is open daily from 10am - 5pm unless it is closed for filming or a special event. It is very rare that you can enter the actual house but you are free to enter the lovely gardens (free) and there is plenty of parking (free). I won't go into the history of this beautiful estate, you can view that on their website if you are interested. Plenty of films were filmed here (and obviously continue to be) including The Fabulous Baker Boys; Nixon; The Body Guard; Batman & Robin; Airforce One; X-Men; Spiderman original and Spiderman III; Charlies Angels Full Throttle; There Will Be Blood; The Social Network; Star Trek 2 and loads more. Not only are the gardens very beautiful, but you can also get great views of the city and you will feel a world away from Los Angeles.",Belgo96

50,A historic Los Angeles landmark,"I've visited Greystone Mansion twice and I could easily go back again and never get tired of it. If you're lucky enough to be in town on a day when the mansion is open to the public, definitely take a tour through it.

After stopping here, you might just take a walk through the neighborhood, which itself is equally impressive.

50,Imagine being a tycoon in the 1920s and living here.,"My travel partner had another appointment in Beverly Hills. Parked, dropped her off. got a coffee at the Whole Foods in BH and sauntered off for a walk. I had heard about the Greystone Mansion and decided to walk up there. Another walk through the beautiful neighborhood on the way(however do the residents realize California is in a drought? Guess money can't buy you love but can buy water for extensive landscaping and lawns). I arrived about 9:30 am. There were only 3 people walking around the grounds at that time.As written by others, you cannot go int the mansion-there are some windows to peek in. But the treasure of visiting here is not going on a guided tour with time constrictions but the freedom to roam the grounds at your leisure. There are many different verandas, balustrades, landings with gardens and water features. You can see the original pool outline and it appears quite large for a pool of that era. It is now a bricked over patio. I love tours but this was incredible that I could wander and linger and enjoy each area. I couldn't help to think that maybe this was what it was like living here-enjoying the gardens for the shear pleasure. Again not hearing a tour guide's commentary or the instructions to move on, but just to be in the moment of enjoying the beauty and imagining a way of life. At a later date I would like to take a tour and went home to read up on the mansion's history.The other wonderful thing is since it is up on a hill, there is an incredible view of Los Angeles.",labonvoyer

50,Very Pretty!,"The gardens were beautiful. Photo ops were everywhere. This place is perfect for weddings. A peek through the mansion's windows show the house is just as beautiful inside. Lots of stairs. There is a bathroom and a drinking fountain at the bottom of the gardens, near the actual mansion. We spent about 2 hours there. Do not miss this place if you are in Beverly Hills.",Linmar82

40,Beautiful property for strolling and exploring (I’m fine with the restrictions),"I considered it a breath of fresh air to find a park where one can walk around among well-kept landscaping, do a little exploring and take in some nice views. All this without worrying about what a tot might be doing in the fountain, which not-on-a-leash dog might see me as a chew toy, or when I might get bonked in the head with a Frisbee or soccer ball. Say what you will about all the rules, if you don’t like these (see below) there are plenty of other parks that let you hang out for the whole day as if it’s your outdoor home. Come to Greystone Park to enjoy some tranquility, manicured green grass, lots of terraces and little gardens, and good views of the L.A. skyline. The visitors seem to be well-mannered. There is virtually no garbage anywhere.As for the mansion, the interior is generally off limits except for special events and prearranged tours. You can walk right up to the home, all around it, and even look in a few windows. Judging by all the movies that have been filmed here, it’s obvious that the place is amazing.There are brick and concrete walkways all over the property, and these lead to many terraces, patios, fountains and formal gardens in what reminded me of a renaissance style. There is quite a bit of elevation differential in this park, but walking just about anywhere should be okay for anyone in average physical condition.RULES. In this park the following are prohibited: smoking, picnicking, sports, personal training, animals and electronically powered musical or public address devices. The taking of photos or videos is allowed by permit only (there were many people taking pictures while I was there; the sign might pertain to professional photo shoots, but I’m far from certain about that).The park entrance is on Loma Vista Drive, not on Doheny Road.",Jim L
40,Greystone Mansion,"I've been going to Greystone Mansion for at least 11-12 years now, ever since I first heard of it's existence and acquisition by The Beverly Hills Park District while having coffee at a coffee shop on Beverly Drive as I read the local weekly paper.The mansion was set to be subdivided and sold off into more mini-( or even Maxi)mansion parcels as most of Trousdale Estates had been acquired previously--Greystone's property was at one time considerably larger--100 acres or so--but developers had over time whittled it down to a mere 30 acres or so, most of it on a hilltop or hillsides. The mansion was built in 1929 for the Doheny's, of oil wealth, and it does have a ' history'.The mansion itself isn't often open--primarily during a few occasions in the springtime and autumn--small chamber music or other performance and ' mystery theater', to name but a few of the ' events' within the mansion's walls. There is around 50,000 square feet, much of it in beautiful tile floorings surrounded by incredible woodwork and carvings and several stairwells.There are numerous windows, both large and small, on several sides of the mansion that provide broad vistas and glimpses of hills and land all the way to the ocean about 8 miles away.The most beautiful features are the many gardens where one is free to wander to enjoy the atmosphere, variety of floral and botanical scents, and the vistas at various points.",Robert C

40,Saturday at Greystone,"I visited Greystone mansion and park on a nice, sunny late Saturday morning. I was in awe of this architectural masterpiece before I'd even set foot on the actual grounds. It called to me from the hill/vista which it is set upon. The park is very beautiful, perfect for anyone who enjoys immaculate landscape and scenic views.There was a lot going on the day I visited; a wedding photo shoot in the park and a play at the actual Greystone mansion, which prohibited anyone from stalking around the premises too closely. I'd only wished I had visited on a Saturday when they offered the ranger tour of the mansion. I would've loved to see inside, w/o having to sneak a peek through the windows. This historic landmark is definitely a must see in Beverly Hills.",LonelyBoyTraveler
40,Nice outdoor area,"This is a nice area to walk around in. The mansion is not open except for prearranged tours, which are not free. The outdoor grounds, however, are free. The view is very pretty and this is a nice way to get some exercise. Public bathrooms are available but there are no options for food/drinks. I would not call this one of the top attractions in LA, but it's worth doing if you have a car and some extra free time.",Kat0425

50,Amazing property,"First I must say that I love old houses, almost any old house. Of course mansions are a particular favorite. Grey stone mansion was not a disappointment. My husband and I took a private tour of the property and house. Daniel, the park ranger, was very knowledgable and was kind enough to put up with all my questions. It is a beautiful house. I am so pleased the city chose to keep it and continue to restore and care for it. Interior details are not to be missed.",Oldhousebabe

It's an interesting place with a fascinating history and you get to explore it all in this 1.5hr tour. We thoroughly enjoyed it, especially the murder mystery and ghost stories. We'd like to go back for one of their concert series. It's too bad that they had to fill up the original swimming pool outside with concrete and bricks. I'm sure it was quite beautiful in its heyday.",alyssa00
40,Great drive and beautiful house and gardens,"The drive to the mansion take you thought Beverly Hills. It is a beautiful drive. The view from there is of course, spectacular.

50,Beautiful - easy walk!,"It's hard to believe people (the Doheny family) once actually lived here. The mansion was built in the 1920s and has now been preserved as a park location. It's kind of like a Los Angeles-local, slightly scaled down version of Hearst Castle. The grounds are gorgeous and there are so many plants and flowers and fountains. You will probably recognize the mansion and surroundings from countless films. The location's website lists some of them. There was a murder/suicide at this location, too, which makes for extra excitement. Ned Doheny was killed by his male assistant, who then killed himself. This was quite the scandal in its day. There are murder mystery events offered by Beverly Hills Parks and occasionally there are other events (concerts, for example) offered here. It is a great way to get inside. But you can peek in the windows and see a lot of the beautiful interior design.",portergirlbooks

My teens even loved it because it has been the filming location for so many movies they recognized various areas and liked taking their picture there. It's beautiful and now maintained by the state. You can go wander or take a picnic. There are a few park rangers there who can give you some information, but if we hadn't had our guide we may not have enjoyed it as much.

The house it self is not open to the public but you can get some great peeks through some of the lower windows. The gardens are exquisite and the house is amazing. Be sure to look up and admire the stone and brick work especially on the chimneys. A lost art in my opinion. On their website they also list the movies that have been filmed there.

I would say wear comfortable shoes and hopefully it is not too hot the day you visit. Since it was close to 90 degrees, our visit of the grounds was limited around the estate.

50,Spectacular Beverly Hills historical landmark of the former Edward Doheny Jr estate!!!,"WOW, I can't imagine Edward Doheny Jr. (Aka Ned) and his family, lived here in 1928!!! Serious gold and oil pioneer tycoons! The rich history is insightful, and this Beverly Hills historical landmark is a surprising secret around town! No admission charge to roam around the stately grounds. We strolled here, just after our double date brunch, and everyone was BLOWN away with amazement! It was a first for all four of us! One one ever knew this place existed in Beverly Hills, after living here so long, what the sheesh? So scenic and picturesque... We each said we wanted too come back here again. Very tranquil for reading, writing, reflection, introspection! The opulent grounds, regal ballisters, magnificient stones and staircases, manicured trees & gardens, concrete water fountains, iron works, and the 46,000 sf mansion (with 55 livable bedrooms) make this stunning vast estate a magnificent sight, rich with Hollywood history. I remember seeing this beautiful estate in Indecent Proposal and There Will Be Blood! TIP: Since you cannot picnic here, I suggest you dine out prior or after visiting here!",LoveSchnauzers

40,"Unexpected, beautiful and free!","Only 3 minutes driving from sunset in Beverly Hills! You need to come and take a walk in this gorgeous park, visit all the Italian style gardens by the parking lot, and walk around the property. The mansion itself is not regularly open to the public, but you can book a tour of the inside, they usually require a minimum of the 10 people, $15 each, or anyway a total cost of $150. There are events throughout the year, concerts and such, so that's a way to see the inside as well. A lot of movies have been filmed here, and they keep filming, so make sure that you check if they are open to the public before you go. Beside that the mansion is spectacular and very well maintained. The view from here is breathtaking and the park is just lovely! No pictures and picnic allowed! :((",ManuLLosangeles
50,Carzy cool history,A great place to walk around and soak up the surroundings. They have filmed a lot of film and tv shows at this place. See if you can fiqure any of them out. They also have a murder mystery and small concerts also.,Terry W
50,Absolutely lovely!,"What a nice surprise.....and it is completely free! (even the parking!). If you are in Beverly Hills...then you must stop by. The grounds are gorgeous and you can see the city in the background. You will not be disappointed if you love beautiful properties.This has to be one of the most impressive, completely free sites I have been to.What would be spectacular is if you could also somehow have a tour of the inside.",Dave R
50,So cool!,"I came here on a whim actually. Never heard of this place but I saw it was a stop on one of the Hollywood tours. I was in the area and decided to check it out. This is a great free park and beautiful estate. There is so much history here. Great views. Only bad thing is that you cannot take pics because you need a permit. Tons and tons of movies and tv shows were filmed here. I was lucky enough to have a park ranger walk with me and give me all the juicy details of the home. Thanks so much, you made my day!",Mwar1004
50,5 Tips For Visiting The Breathetaking Greystone Mansion,"5 Tips For Visiting The Breathetaking Greystone Mansion#1: Check the opening hours!Yes the park is usually open to public everyday but if there is an event like party or wedding, it is closed for public. So check before you leave! You don't want to come and be disappointed right? Check their website or call!#2: Read the history before you come hereThe history of Greystone Mansion is very fascinating and it will give you a better sense of this mansion. Well.. let me tell you a little bit about this mansion. The mansion was a wedding gift from a gold magnate, Edward Laurence Doheny Sr. to his son Edward “Ned” Laurence Doheny, Jr. It took them more than 3 years and $3 million to finish the mansion but I guess it really paid off seeing how grand it is. However, tragically only after 5 months of moving into the mansion, Ned was murdered by his friend inside the home. Very terrible huh?#3: You cannot go inside the mansion unless...You book private ranger tour here or you want to book the mansion for your event therefore you need to see the inside LOL! Unfortunately, I didn't know about this tour and I could only peek through the window.. Sigh.. It would have been nice though to see the interior of the mansion!#4: Dont't forget to bring your full-charged phone camera, digicam or DLSR here!The Greystone Mansion is undeniably exquisite and really perfect place to have your pictures taken! Every corner is really beautiful and I am sure you will find yourself ooh-aah seeing all otherworldly magnificent view and architecture here. However, if you want to take professional pre-wedding pictures take here, you must get a permit up to 2 weeks in advance. Unless.. you want to take your pre-wedding photos by your camera phone. Teehee.#5: Do not bring your picnic basket here!Yes yes it is so tempting to have a picnic here but.. they do not allow people to do it here! So before you got caught, please do not bring your picnic basket here.Blogging about food, travel, shopping and trend worldwide at www.thetwotales.com",putri a

50,Good place to take a walk,The grounds are gorgeous and the landscaping and architecture of the building are a great place to take pictures at. It's a nice change from the noisy traffic. I would not miss seeing this mansion. It's amazing. Unfortunately they do not usually let people inside but the exterior is just beautiful.,irene2211
40,serene and peaceful with a view,while visiting my friends took me here... beautiful landscape and property. Would have been nice to be able to wander inside the mansion. great fountains and views of the area. Glad I saw this hidden gem,Neets007
40,A haven of peace in a noise filled city.,"If you want to take a long, quiet walk away from the noise, the hustle and chaos of the city, definitely go to Greystone. The grounds are beautifully maintained and peering into the windows of the mansion is like looking into the past. I've taken a number of out of town visitors over the years and we've spent hours walking the grounds or just sitting and enjoying the quiet. Truly a masterpiece of design and architecture not to mention a very interesting past.",vicdru
40,"Absolutely beautiful, but no pictures allowed!","The gardens and landscape are gorgeous, romantic and superbly kept and the mansion (or should I say castle) was riveting. It's pretty much the only mansion of notoriety in Beverly Hills that you can get this close to and has been used in a long list of films throughout the years. You can walk almost fully around the exterior as well as inside the center courtyard and its all FREE!However, I was very disappointed to see the minute we entered the garden, signs that prohibited anyone from taking pictures or video without a permit (among other obvious rules), so we couldn't capture our experience. Other than that, it was a beautiful stop and easy to get to and definitely worth a half hour stop if you're in the area.",NewEnglandTraveler11
30,Beautiful place,"It was nice, but when we went it was hot and we did not come prepared with extra water. We did not know what to expect. It's a great place for a picnic or a romantic walk if it isn't too hot out.",Leah B
50,MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN LA,"DO NOT miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful place a hidden gem in LA. The views are breathtaking and walking the grounds is a great way to spend the afternoon. I often come here to eat lunch or have a small champage split & take in the views. Great place to think, ponder and plan your way in/out of relationship, job, next step in life. Extremely peaceful. I know the grounds can be used for special events but haven't had the privilege of attending any other than annual events the city sponsors. When the design house is open to public you MUST GO -- one of the most spectacular homes in LA.",KathlnCampbell
50,Beautiful spot,"Came there on a gray November day, with the sun trying to break through. Since people in LA consider that horrible weather, we had the place to ourselves. Lovely. Go. Relax. Just a few minutes from Sunset. Beautiful views. Check the web and read the history. Very cool.",movieland
50,Wow! What a cool gem in Beverly Hills,"The tour guide from Glitterati Tours took us here during our private tour of Beverly Hills . Had no idea this place existed. Tons of movies have been filmed here. A must for movie lovers. Also, beautiful gardens and estate. A true piece of Beverly Hills history. Recommended!",Jayne K
50,Beautiful!,"We accidentally stumbled upon this mansion and we found it to be so neat to visit. It was amazing to think that people actually live in houses this huge. It was fun to tour the grounds and it had great city views. We weren't able to go into the mansion, but still enjoyed ourselves. Our children loved exploring the grounds too and loved the turtles.",Celisse
20,Expected More,Checked out their website before coming to make sure there wasn't an event going on. Website all clear so went hoping to have the great experience others said they had. OF COURSE---a wedding going on and so we couldn't really see much. Just some grounds in rather disrepair. We will try to go back though during the week to see if it's any better.,OldSeasonedTraveler
50,A peaceful and scenic spt,"Whether you are visiting La or a local , take some time out of your day to visit the Graystone Mansion. I enjoyed the peaceful walk along the gardens and so did my toddler. It's a gorgeous outdoor spot for an engagement party or wedding.",vivacouture
50,Incredible place for some peace and serenity!,"Love, love, love this place!! I've been going here for over twenty five years and it's always amazing! The grounds are huge and there are plenty of places to explore. (Of course, you'll be disappointed because you can't tour the mansion.) If you actually take time to explore the grounds you can find little secret passages where you can get a peek inside!! The views of the city are also amazing (especially on a clear day)!!Greystone is a great place for everyone...couples, families and kids. I have yet to find someone who couldn't find something to enjoy while visiting here. The kids always love the koi pond and the adults are amazing with the architecture and the teens can find places to escape the **gasp** parents!!There are some stairs, but there are also paths you can use to get around to nearly all of the same places.When I first moved to Los Angeles years ago, I find a ton of solace while walking the grounds!! You can find yourself a bit overwhelmed with the city and it's sometimes nice to find your own little place to escape and Greystone does it!!",spenchea
30,Off the beaten path,"A visit to Greystone Mansion is always pleasant. The grounds are lovely, and (here's a big plus for L.A.) parking is free! However, don't expect to actually go inside the mansion. It's usually closed to the public. The only time you can go in is for special events, like designer showcases. Even if you go to a wedding here, it's on the patio and not inside the house. So unless you can get a private tour, a visit here is going to be pretty short.",VitalSpring
40,What a history!,"Our private tour guide from Glitterati Tours shared this Beverly Hills treasure with us when we were doing our celebrity homes tour. A beautifully manicured property and gorgeous mansion with tons of history. A must for fans of film and television, considering the dozens of shows that have been filmed here. Our kids loved it, cuz of the scenes from Spiderman and National Treasure.",Crystal T
50,Beautiful Views,I was married at Greystone Mansion in 2011. Ceremony took place in formal garden and reception overlooked beautiful Los Angeles. It was an absolute dream.,angelfirst
40,Beautiful and serene gardens,"We went here partly using up our last few hours in LA. The Mansion, though not open to the public, is huge and you can walk all round it. The roof tiles are full size slate patio slabs!We were virtually the only ones there and got some great photos of the gardens, fountains and Manor with nobody else in the pictures! The gardens aren't big but it was quiet, serene, beautiful and with panoramic views of (smog enshrouded!!) LA.Worth a visit.",jrapeter
30,bummed out couldnt see the inside of the mansion!,boohoo.. when i stopped by this past tuesday the mansion was closed. no tours nothing. the grounds were open for you to roam but the inside was what i came for. i wanted to see it! but that's fine. at least parking was free and at least i didnt come with a stupid tour that cost $100 a day to stop here and do nothing. i felt bad for those folks that were here on tour. it was hot and sunny and we managed to find a shaded area/bench to sit on and pass some time which was quite nice.,sasli
50,beyond amazing!,"This place is a must see if you are a movie buff, really into Hollywood history, have an eye for beautiful things or just want a leisure afternoon in the backyard of a placial estate. My review will concentrate on the movies shot here, which alone makes it worthwhile! The estate was owned and built by Edward Doheney (yup, the dude Doheney Drive is named after) and was the largest home ever built in Beverly Hills (46,000 square feet).If you peek through the main doors, you will remember some movies as you look into the main landing, the grand staircase and iconic checkerboard floor! Of all movies featured here, some of my favorites are Lili Tomlin/Steve Martin's All off Me and Bette Davis' Dead Ringer! The bowling alley in the basement was used for the final scene of There Will be Blood!Take a deep breath, beacuse here is a list of other films it was used in, READY?1993: Indecent Proposal; Also, in the Spider-Man movie series, Greystone was the home of Harry Osborne's father: the Green Goblin! In the X-Men films, Greystone's was courtyard was used as the exterior of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.In the movie ""Town and Country"" the mansion stands in for Charlton Heston's mansion in Sun Valley.Other films using this location include ""What Women Want,"" ""The Bodyguard"" (RIP Whitney Houston), ""The Phantom"", ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Ghostbusters II"", ""Death Becomes Her"", ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", ""The Beautician And The Beast"", ""Guilty By Suspicion"",and ""Air Force One"".Sir Elton John used this home for the video of ""I Want Love"" where Robert Downey Jr is wandering about the home ""singing"" the song!Barack Obama held a $28,500-per-plate political fundraiser here as well., Some attendees were Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg, Tobey Maguire, Jodie Foster, Eddie Murphy, Barbara Mandel, Antonio Banderas, Will Ferrell and Jamie Lee Curtis.They even shot episodes of ""Dark Shows"" - NOT the Johnny Depp movie here!There is a relaxed, rarefied at the top of the hill within the estate surrounded by redwoods. There's a fresh pine scent in the air and you can catch many city views, particularly in the rear terrace of the mansion!Look into the windows of the home when you can. You will see the vast marble halls and amazing ballrooms, with gorgeous chandeliers! This is where Demi met Redford to begin their ""Indecent Proposal.""There are no public tours of the house itself but there are some events you can pay for and get in, such as the interior designers event where you see each room decorated in different flares by professional designers to compliment the stately estate! I believe they also have concerts which will gain entry to the inside of the estate as well (seasonal).Greystone is really an ""LA secret"" and not many know about it and it happens to be one of my favorite places to go to!It really feels like going into the backlot of a major studio, except this home is real and free for the public to see. It is owned and run by the City of Beverly Hills and typically not very touristy. Also there is no admission!",traveler4k
40,History Lovers find some in L.A.,Do a tour with a focus on ghost stories and go with family or friends. Marvelous architecture and interiors. Catch the gardens at dusk.,carlitogetsaround
50,Such an amazing hidden gem,Why all LAers don't know about this place is beyond me. Anyone into beautiful landscaping and amazing architecture so difinitly plan at least an hour here. It was a really simple stop to add to our days events. Free parking in a large lot and just a beauitiful spot to take it all in. Again if you've just got an hour it's worth the stop but you could bring a picnic lunch and a good book and drift back to another time while spending an afternoon lounging on the front lawn. I loved it!,Vittoria S
50,Shhhh,I debated about reviewing this location as it's a quiet non touristy escape for those of us who need to relax and get away for a bit. It is breathtaking though. Our family has spent hours walking around and relaxing in the sun here.,Darkdivine

50,A must-see!,"The Greystone Mansion is only open during the day, so make sure you go there early enough to enough some time there. It's located in the hills of Beverly Hills surrounded by multi-million dollar mansions and about 5 min from the Beverly Hills Hotel. It is the former Doheny mansion that is now owned by the City of Beverly Hills. Many weddings, events, and movies have been shots in or around the mansion.The garden is beautiful and extremely well maintained. The building itself is gorgeous with lots of character. You cannot enter the building, though. But just walk to the back through the garden and you'll be able to enjoy an amazing view all over Los Angeles. It's just worth it to go for the view alone!",Chris C
