30,Not much to see up there.,"The house with the stairs in front is not the main house, but was purchased so that he would own the entire cul de sac. The gates to the West are where the main house is located. It is guarded and you really cannot see much. It is a tight cul de sac so it is best to turn around if there are a lot of cars going up.",love2skiLosAngeles
40,North Sweetzer,"I went on one of those tour busses and was told Johnny Depp owned all the houses on North Sweetzer. It's a small road that dead ends so there are only a few house. One was for deliveries, employees, family, and his house.",_cardaniels3
40,Tough views,We went there on a tour and it is such a large place. You can't see much due to the folage but it is impressive and the road getting there is worth the drive. Not a big celeb follower though,rubenjohnson914
30,Can't see much,"The tour buses don't stop and you don't get to see much and they also point them out so fast you can't get photos and you end up not knowing who,s is who,s but johnny depps was narrow and the drive covered by lots of bushes and plants so you can't really see much much to my dismay as iam I mad fan , think on my next visit I may choose the houses I want to see and do it privately when the traffic has died down",Marilyn B
50,Part of the Warner Bros & Movie Star Homes tour.,We went past here as part of our Warner Bros & Movie Star Homes tour day tour. Our guide knew all the important celebrity locations.,Ross F
30,mixed,Its hard to see the house and also hard to get too. Didn't stay too long as felt a bit weird wanted to see what I could see and over stayed mu welcome.,Andrew F
10,Don't bother,"As a neighbor of Mr. Depp, I implore you to please not go here! You can't see the house, only gates and vegetation, the road is narrow and steep, and all you're doing is bothering everyone in the area with no pay-off! I have lived across the street since Mr. Depp moved in many years ago, and I have seen him ONE TIME!For the most part, he is not in residence, and even if he is, trust me, you won't see him, his house, his kids, his wife, his dogs.....you may see a security guard or two, but that's it.",JohnRyan724
10,not very interesting,These celebrities map are probably authentic. I understand the appeal for their fans to see where celebrities have a house. But I doubt the maps are up to date.,sipivu
40,Very cool pad for Capt Jack Sparrow,"We bought our own Star map since we have a car and decided to view a few star homes on our own rather than do the rather loud and gaudy double decker tour bus. Plus, this way after seeing a few homes we could decide when the tours over and we've seen enough. Johnny Depp's home was cool and set amid the Hollywood Hills. It's a rather steep drive on quite narrow streets. Many larger vehicles would have difficulty with the narrow streets. Occasionally there's a car coming from the opposite direction and you have to take turns using the narrow Street. Johnny Depp seems to have some very tall, cool tropical trees behind his gated fence and property. Palm trees and even some Bamboo trees are visible. We didn't park or get out of the car. Its fun to see where a star you like lives but I feel it's intrusive to peer through fences or hedges (like paparazzi) or honk your car horn. Johnny's a cool guy (as are most celebs) and deserve privacy at their homes. I'm sure they understand that fans like me would like to see where they live. There's a way to do that and still respect their privacy as well as keeping in mind that they have neighbors.",0221Serendipity
40,Cool but disappointed,"The Star Map says the house is viewable but I had a hard time figuring out what was what. the entrance, main one, secondary, etc. but regardless it was cool to see and to be steps away from his home.. Seeing some celebrity homes was a really cool experience. not many people can say they went to see their lovely, secluded homes..",Steph C
