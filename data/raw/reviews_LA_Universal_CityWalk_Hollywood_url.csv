40,"Great attractions, but lots were virtual","- Highlights:. Hogwarts: The lockers are opened via finger print and stay good for 2 hours. There are lots of people waiting.. For the special effects in the amphitheater, do not wait in line there is almost always room in the back.. Tramsformers 3D: go to the 1-person line (single), it goes faster. Go independently if you are in group and you will most of the time be seated together anyway. It lasts 5 minutes. There are lots of special effects and they are well done. It moves a lot. There will be a 65 minute wait for this ride late in the day.. The Mummy: Great but the people who ride in the back of the ride will have their head slammed back and forth and you will be wet. It is in the dark and it is really scary. You can take pics with the mummy outside.. Minions: It is a nice ride and there was a 15-20 minute wait. It is cute for young kids and it's inside with A/C. If you are feeling a bit sick to your stomach, look down and not at the screen and it will help a bit.. Walking dead: It opens at 4:15 p.m. that day and it is great to walk around the building and get scared. It is a 10 minutes walk and is like a haunted house. Go at the end of the day.. Studio Tour: Do it before 5:15 p.m. because it closes and the lines are long; up to 30-40 minutes. Even at 5:45 p.m. they accepted people, so maybe don't rush. There is lots of stuff to see and have lots of memory available on your digital camera or smart phone. You will also see the Fast and Furious ride, King Kong, and Jaws )with the shark that cones out at you and a river that almost washes the tramway out). It takes 1 hour total.- Lowlights:. Hogwarts: 30 minutes wait to get in and 20 minutes inside to put backpack in locker. and then it stopped right as we were on the ride, took 20 minutes to get us out but they gave us a fast pas to come back later on (we did wait 20 more minutes though for the lockers) and not stand in line. It was nice and had lots of digital effects.. Griffin ride: It does not warrant the 40 minutes wait. It's too short and there is not much to see - no thrills. It takes about 3 minutes to ride.- TIPS:. We highly recommend getting the tickets online. $10 for 4 $25 for parking.. A bit of a walk to get to the entrance/gates.. No need to print tickets.. You can bring in up to 2 liters of water per person.. For Hogwarts ride: Do not bring bags in, put your things in your pocket. It takes too long to get a locker.. Use of their free wi-fi, it is good and you do not have to your real email and zip code. It works all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Masque2Fer
50,Bday trip,"We stayed at a hotel close to City Walk,so were able to walk over there a few times. We always enjoyed our time there. We tried a couple restaurants and shopped some.

30,Universal studios,"Went midweek, traffic was what expected, terrible, rip off parking, $28 general to $50 upfront. Park was reasonably accessible, rode some old rides, some new.

40,Antojitos at CityWalk,"Citywalk is a very popular destination for both visitors to Los Angeles and locals in L.A. and the Valley. It is a great place to people watch and shop. Until recently, there hasn't been a good choice for authentic Mexican food. The atmosphere is really nice with artwork of all kinds all around. There is also live music on the patio. Most of all . . . the food and drinks are worth the money, as it is a bit pricy as a tourist location. If you find yourself at CityWalk, check out Antojitos for sure. It's a good idea to make a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Storyteller752260
40,Lots of interesting things around,We came here before and after Universal Studios visit (on 2 days). The kids loved the water fountain that squirts water up in the air (and running across it to dodge the water). The dragon and wings are good photo opportunities. The sweet shop (you really don't want to go in there - you might never leave) and the numerous restaurants. If you park in the parking lot suggest using the Universal App to remember where you parked your car.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior

50,Great shopping center,It's a very cool shopping area with lots of food places. We stopped at hot topic to get my son a hat before we entered the park. We also ate at Hard Rock after.

40,"Interesting park - Just be prepared, it is not wallet friendly.","I have been here before, but it has been a few years (like 14 or 15). I was with a group from work and it was right before the winter shut down (dare I say the word - “Christmas”). So we had been at Warner Brothers in the morning and one of our clients got us free passes to Universal Studios ( Plus expedited passes for two of the rides - sweet). The pluses? Lots to see and do, lots of restaurants, the Park is kind of fun (the Terminator Ride was excellent), The Harry Potter part of the park was very nice. The ok stuff? The studio tour was OK. I had been on it before, so the King Kong part had been updated and the Fast and the Furious was interesting. But all in all, I would have to think twice about going to this attraction. It is not wallet friendly, but if you have kids, it is probably worth the effort. We were there right before the Christmas holidays, so it was sort of busy, but not crazy busy. I would imagine that in the Summer, it is a mad house of activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1994GOjohnk

50,Oh Wow! What a walking experience! BUT YOU PAY FOR IT WITH PARKING FEE!,"My wife & I wanted to check out this place... and we knew in advance that the parking fee would be... $ 27... and would be such for our one-to-two hour visit. The garage attendant ""warned"" us about the fee, and explained that a cheaper valet price could be had closer to the walk-in entrance to the park. But, since we had our airline traveling ""stuff"" with us (from the east coast), I didn't want to be too trusting with a valet. So... we paid the $ 27 fee and drove for a LONG time in the HUMONGUS garage to the assigned parking area. (There were parking attendants ""pointing the way"" at oh so many turns.)But... putting that $ 27 fee out of my mind, we REALLY enjoyed our brief visit. There are LOTS of FUN ""statuesque"" icons scattered in front of the many retail stores and eateries. Why, I even did a dance with the ""shrimp"" in front of Bubba Gump's. Some of the stores are sooo fascinating. Our main target - The Los Angeles Sock Market - did not disappoint. We stocked up (""socked up""?) on unique, artsy, humorous Christmas socks as ""stocking stuffers"" for our kids and grandchildren.A surprise for us was to see a Voodoo Doughnut. When we had been in Portland, Oregon, we decided to not wait a half hour in line to be served. Here we walked right in and bought some weird but tasty doughnuts to take to our son and his family who we would be visiting.All-in-all, if you go here to eat, watch a movie, and want go to some very unique retail shopping places, the $ 27 parking fee should not prevent you from having a FUN time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EwanderingMan
50,Hard rock,Right next to Universal Themepark. I would love to have seen that but it costs 150$ so I just stayd at free area: CityWalk. Didn’t find my ”The happy place” -tee and that was dissapointing. Otherwise real nice place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Departure828160
50,Great place for shopping and dining after whole day play at USH,"The citywalk is a great place for shopping and dining after the whole day play at Universal studio hollywood. It is a rainy day, but the lights look great, and the shops are all open around 6pm. We did some shopping then tried one Chinese restaurant called ""Dongpo Kitchen"" which best seller dish is ""roasted duck"". It is ok comparing to what we have at bay area for ""roasted duck"".

50,Great restaurants and places to shop,"Universal CityWalk is adjacent to the theme parks of Universal Parks & Resorts. It’s also an entrance to the park from the parking lots.Restaurants, retail shops and a theater will definitely keep you busy here at Universal CityWalk.If going into the park, there are lockers located across from Dodgers. It’s $12 for the day so it’s convenient to store things there that you don’t want to carry throughout the park.Christmas decorations are being put up so CityWalk will look pretty during the holidays.

40,Universal CityWalk Hollywood,"If you like to shop or need a place to eat this is a great place to visit for you. It's free to walk along here but you will have to pay for parking ($27 general parking before 6pm and $10 after 6pm). If you want to attend a movie there is a 18 auditorium theatre and I think you can get $5 parking if you attend a movie.If you want to eat there are plenty of casual and quick service restaurants depending on your preference. During our visit we ate at the Hard Rock Cafe and enjoyed it.If you want to shop they offer plenty of novelties & souvenirs stores and apparel shops including stores for footwear and accessories.The atmosphere is neat and it's a place for the family, couples or friends just hanging out. They have it designed so you have to walk through CityWalk after parking to get to the entrance of Universal Studios. You can spend as much time as you want here depending on how many stores you enter and the type of meal you eat (if you eat here). It's neat to see at night with everything lit up (like the Vegas Strip during the day vs night).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963

Going during the week was less crowded only had to wait 40 mins on one ride they rest we waited 15 or 20 mins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763victoriaw
40,"Great for Tourists, Not So Much for Locals.","If I had friends in town and they wanted to see all the tourist attractions I would take them to City Walk along with Hollywood and all the other things that people that don't live here have heard of. Now, you are not going to learn a thing, there is no cool architecture, it is not a museum and there is no culture to be found anywhere that would show someone what LA is like. It is a very crowded, restaurant aplenty, pricey place that sits at near the top of Studio City near the Universal Theme Park.Parking is 25$ unless you go to a movie--there is a very nice, albeit crowded theater there that has maybe 15 or more screens. If you want to see a movie, cool, your parking will be reduced to 5$.The area is up a slope and if you feel like walking this is great for you. You can stop at all the shops, and there are a ton and buy something at retail. You are not going to get a sale or a decent price on anything here, and most things you can get at home, regardless of where you live, but if you really want a cool Dodger cap, they have that, if you feel the need for an ever so cute tee shirt that attempts to say something profound, they have that too. Want to go bowling, well, you are at the right place, just make sure you have plenty of money.The restaurants are for the most part chains, but all are quite good and you will be happy after you wait in line to be seated.The coolest part of City Walk is the signage and the lights. At night it is cool to look at and the place is kept super clean. I go there at the insistence of my grandson (12) or I avoid at all costs. It is great for kids--so much candy to buy, such high prices you will pay.But despite all of the above, if I have friends that come into LA, let's say from the mid-west, I am taking them to City Walk and they will have fun. Personally, I will be the one that got medicated the moment I parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,En route to universal studios,"My Husband and I walked through city walk on the way to fright night at universal studios. There are ample eateries, shops and coffee spots to choose between.

50,Review for Antojitos Mexican Food - Citywalk,"I want to start with saying that I could not find this establishment on TripAdvisor, but we liked it so much I had to post it somewhere. So I figured this would be the spot...We had lunch here during a recent visit to Universal Studios Hollywood. Instead of eating in the park, we thought we would try this place for a nice meal before heading to the park for a full day. We were staying at the Sheraton Universal Hotel (across the street), so Citywalk was a convenient option for us.•We had lunch at about 11:30 AM on a Friday. It was not crowded at all when we went at this time.•The inside of the restaurant was pretty cool. Colorful, trendy and clean.•We had house margaritas with blue curacao added to them. Amazing and delicious. Try it.•We split the pulled pork nachos and beef fajaitas. Both were good, but the nachos were seriously incredible. You have to get these.•Out of whole 1½ week vacation, this meal was honestly one of our favorites.•Service was good and the prices really were not bad given the property is on Citywalk.I have to say I did not expect a restaurant located at Universal Studios Citywalk would be this memorable. If you are looking for a GREAT meal option on Citywalk, for sure check this place out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JTF_1977
40,Great Place to Walk Around and enjoy/,CityWalk is the outdoor mall around Universal Studio Tour. It is full of colorful shops and has activities and restaurants. The theatres are some of the best in town with great seating and always a good selection of films to see. Parking is $12 and subject to change but you can take the subway although that involves a lot of walking. Other than the parking there is no additional expense to just walk around and it is fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love2skiLosAngeles
50,Enjoyed the visit,I really loved this place even I useally not a fun of parks. This park is very special.

After a day there, this is a nice, clean and safe area to wonder through some shops and sit down to dinner in one of the many restaurants on offer.

I'm already in a good mood so I'm just grabbing some drinks or a quick bite at one of the numerous food options. Quick fast food options to full on service restaurants as well as plenty of drink options are at your disposal to get your booze on. The snack and dessert options are plentiful with something for everyone.The shopping mainly consists of gimmick stores that you'll be more likely to browse through versus actually purchase: sneaker shops, sports apparel, novelties and souvenir shops. The Universal souvenirs are available in CityWalk in case you forgot to purchase something inside Universal Studios.The over the top signs and decor makes for some pretty cool social media photo opps. Prices are higher than average because you are in Universal Studios after all, but you knew that coming in here. CityWalk is still a fun outdoor mall venue to hang out if you're in the area. See you at the Comic Book store! Enjoy. =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247
40,Universal boardwalk rocks!,"Really fun and colorful, a great way to start or end the day at Universal. Aside from many restaurants for all budgets, there are also attractions, dance and singing on the main plaza. We really loved Voodoo Donuts!I wish the Mexican restaurant was open, but it was about to open oxe we started.More signs for the van stops and a dedicated place for Uber pick up would be a great addition.

20,Expensive,"A little disappointed with this attraction, Apart from the Waterworld show and bocklot tour (which were very good) all the other shows were poor. If you want rides, this is not the place to go. The rides here are very short and not that exciting. The tickets were $139 each, plus they also want an extra $25 for parking, a bit of a rip off considering we paid over $500 for entry tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guyhinks
50,Great Shopping and Food.,If you are staying at either the Hilton or Sheraton near Universal CityWalk there is a free shuttle to take you to the stores.

40,Great variety,Pretty neat space to walk through from the parking lot to the Universal Studios. CityWalk also provides a great alternative to the park food. We came here on a hot day during lunch to escape the heat and have lunch in an air conditioned location.

We walked to the Universal Studios area and looked over the fence at some of the rides and features. It looked pretty “Disney” like (been there, done that), so we were glad we opted for the more traditional Studio Tour at Warner Brothers.On the way back we went for drinks at ""Howling at the Moon"", a duelling piano bar. My girlfriend had a Coconut cocktail and as usual I had IPA. It was more of a comedy act than a musical performance, even though, all of the performers were professionals.

He had to ask the other employee who was odiously busy and taking on the load he could not deal with.a MESS! No thank you",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erind982
20,It’s like paying to walk up a high street,Don’t get this - pay $10 for parking to then walk up a street with some seriously over inflated pricing in restaurants and shops.The big music screen and fountain display were a hit with my children but that’s scraping the barrel. Most cities have them for free.Top tip - unless you’re going to the cinema and can’t be bothered to walk far - don’t bother!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beas006
40,Plenty of restaurants,"Situated next to universal studios with large multi storey car parking. Clean and tidy, plenty of restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1weetwood
40,Tourist trap,"..but i like it! Sure its one huge trap designen to make you part with even more money, but its good. Its done well, and i didnt even mind.Its also very clean and alot of security around, that gives a good feeling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/969patrikh
40,Not that interesting anymore!,"Very quite place now comparing to 9 yrs. ago! I have been there once before with my brother, but this time I was with my husband. It is an interesting place, perhaps now just the name! I found Universal CityWalk Hollywood now very different comparing to my previous visit 9 yrs. ago, i.e. now it was very quite, with very less neon lights and live atmosphere. In fact, I was quite shocked to see how quite, how dark it was!! Not to mention there were not many eateries available. Just a handful of restaurants were there which were not worth for money! Very disappointed in many ways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayaseeli
40,CLEAN and COLORFUL,"Your walk through here to get to the theme park. There are many stores, restaurants, performers and a cinema to be able to visit while there. Impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
20,25 dollars for parking,"I recommend going to Downtown Disney instead of City Walk. Paying 25 dollars for going to this place not worth it. In Downtown Disney you also have to pay for parking but if you spend 22 dollars in this place the parking is free. So, if you plan to have dinner is better to go to Disney. The place is better too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JuanPabloTraveller
50,Better than the park,Love the city walk!! We went there twice it is worth a visit. The scenery is amazing and the shops and restaurant are to die for. We finish the day by watching a movie before heading back to the hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellejG7554BO
40,a nice way to spend the evening,We had never been there so decided to brave the traffic and go. We parked in the Universal parking garage which was expensive at 25.00. If you are going to the movies then you get a 20.00 credit at the movies so basically bringing the cost down to $5 for parking. if you have dinner you also get the 20.00 credit as well. Its just a bunch of shops and restaurants and not really nothing to be overly excited about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickyc575
40,Lots to See and Do Before and After seeing Universal Studios,This Citywalk has lots to see and do from neat activities to plenty of restaurants and gift shops. While I would only go here if visiting Universal Studios it is definitely worth it to see. Just know that everything is a little more expensive but it's still worth it for the fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesselodge
30,For families,"It's been years since my last visit and it's nice to see all the options for parents. Parking is massive, so take a picture of your space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FadedFoodie
40,A nice break,"One doesn't need to buy a ticket for this. It's right next door to Universal Studios. There are several famous restaurants and eateries (Bubba Gump, Hard Rock Cafe, Taco Bell, Subway). You may want to get your hand stamped at Universal Studios and come to CityWalk for lunch or dinner, where the prices aren't as high as they are in the park. There's an AMC movie theater showing first-run shows as well as many fun shops and boutiques. If you want to buy LA Dodgers' gear, there's an entire store for that. A shuttle to local hotels picks up and drops off here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Raginggranny

40,Nice selection of restaurants!,"Not a lot of retail store action here like a normal mall, but a nice selection of restaurants. This is a great area to relax after the craziness of the Universal Studios and it’s food outlets. Plus, you can go back into Universal after your dinner if you’ve gotten a hand stamp.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dware82320
50,You will never watch any movie the same!,"The whole universal studio experience is as other parks overcharged, oversubscribed and boring. We have found few fun and exciting rides, but the waiting time is always about 30-80 minutes so you mist watch yourself! Minions, Mummy and Hogwarts were great, miss the Simpson ( 80 min wait). On the way to Hogwarts nice features with drinking water and mist while waiting :)However the tour is must have! I wasn't big fun and waiting in sun doesn't help but the tour is amazing! Seeing the sites, the size and feeling.... unforgettable! You will never watch any movie the same !Amazing feature .. the movies on the way .. unbelievable .. must go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joanna6006915
30,short walk to universal,There is not much to see or do here especially for young children. You just have to walk through here to get to universal studios. There are a few places to eat some restaurants and fast food places.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/116franciscod
50,AMC Cinemas CityWalk $6 Ticket Tuesdays,"If you can, don’t miss out on the steal of a deal to catch a movie at AMC CityWalk. For standard digital, cost is $6, other formats $10.

50,GREAT PLACE TO VISIT AND EVEN BETTER AT NIGHT!!,"For all the research, it was bigger than I imagined it...but not too big that you couldn’t take a stroll from one end to the other and enjoy it all. The shops are great and many reasonably priced. There’s something for everyone...candy, clothing, souvenirs, socks, bath items etc... The restaurants are many and with various types of food. A MUST is Bubba Gump’s. I reviewed it and it was fabulous on all counts! So was Tony Roma’s!If you walk around there in the evening, things are lit up with great colors and the water fountain comes up and changes colors as well. There are people randomly set up with music and it’s just a wonderful and vibrant place to be at night. You can sit and just people watch or walk around and enjoy the shops or grab an ice cream or dinner.Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Coming back for more next year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHEINAJ

50,Great way to spend the evening,"This was the first place we visited when we arrived in LA. Its a great place to go in the evening and see all the lights. The atmosphere is great with music and crowds bustling. There is a comic book store, a store that sells just socks! and the universal gift shop is another fun place to visit. Universal citywalk is definately a must-do experience when you add the fact that its free. I would schedule it right after watching the sunset at Griffith as its relatively close. Also, there are economical food options such as Panda Express if you dont want to splurge on a restaurant at the citywalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/salilm2019
50,Fantastic,"A wonderful place!I really love It, I wish I would come back there tomorrow, the park Is the best I have seen in my life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dthespecialist
50,Pinks and Hard Rock Cafe!,"We were able to go to the Hard Rock Café for a pin and tshirt, and then we realized Pinks was upstairs as well! They had a movie theater and tons of places to eat. We also tried a few donuts from Voodoo donuts that were fantastic.We were here on a Saturday in March, and it wasn't crowded at all. Would like to return and see what else they had there, but was short on time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stepper950
40,Busy CityWalk Offers a Huge Universe of Pre- and Post Universal Distraction,"Universal Citywalk is a gauntlet of restaurants and shops that stand between you and the entry to Universal Studios. The Citywalk is loud, brash and hyper-commercial, but I must admit I love it. Plan to stop there for a meal and a shopping wander before hitting the park. Note that the parking is expensive at $25. We valeted and only spent $7 with validation from a restaurant. They got a Hard Rock Cafe...Boo! They got a place that sells mini-donuts by the bucket...Yes!! Live a little people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrGaucho1987

50,A Fun Outdoor Mall,"Located outside Universal Studios, you may find yourself walking through the it if you parked in the E.T, Curios George, or Jurassic parking garages. In addition to clothing, candy, Sephora, and other stores, there are a lot of restaurants like Margaritaville, Bubba Gump, Tony Roma, Chinese, sushi, pizza, and a crepe place. The neon light make it a fun nightspot.The Hawaiian crepe was perfect. I thought there could be a little more strawberries on the strawberry crepe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaireWithLove
40,Fun entertainment venue,"Plenty of shops, restaurants, & a movie theater right outside Universal Studios. They also have a food court area where you can get a meal without having to get a loan!

30,Basically just an outdoor mall,"This is located right outside Universal Studios Theme Park. It is just a small collection of tourist, expensive stores and restaurants. We ate in a Chinese Restaurant that was very good, but overpriced. We also bought candy in a store with a great selection, but again, expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJK456
30,Just another Mall,"Seen one mall seen them all, whilst a little more pimped up than our local mall the intent is the same trying to get you to buy stuff you don't really need. I would spend my time at Universal Studios rather than looking at merchandise I can get at home or on line but each to their own I suppose. That said it does make for an interesting walk to the entrance of Universal, cheers. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hgrundell
30,Neon!,"CityWalk at Universal is a strip of restaurants and shops outside the park that has so much neon happening, you wont even know it is nighttime. Many of the restaurants are large chains that have a branch here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misopiso88

40,Very nice entertainment area for families,My family of four visited here several times during our recent visit to SoCal and enjoyed it. We stayed at the adjacent Hilton and walked over here several nights for dinner and shopping. A nice diversity of restaurants and stores is available and all workers we encountered were very friendly. We definitely enjoyed our time in this area and would visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OSU_Fan1967
50,Universal city walk,I love the atmosphere here! So many cool shops and places to eat. The live entertainment as well as the water area are a great place for my daughter to enjoy herself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tinaxjay23

50,Awesome!,"Spent a day at Universal Studios and the rides were all amazing, lines were long but it was well worth it. Next time I will get the express pass. However, on our way out we walked around the CityWalk and they have amazing restaurants and stores to shop at. I will definitely spend just a day at the CityWalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msdiva25

40,Good way to finish your day off at Universal Studios,I found Universal City Walk Hollywood a great way to finish off the day once the Universal Studios Theme Park closed since it is open for a number of hours afterwards. There are plenty of different stores to explore and shop at along with plenty of various restaurants for all sorts of food options as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodyt4130
40,Universal City Walk,"So much to look at, massive Christmas tree and plenty of great photo spots.

40,Cool place for teens to hang out.,"One of the most popular tourist attractions in L.A., Universal City Walk is the reason why downtown Burbank didn't get a formerly planned ""mini Disneyland park"" in the middle of their mall, which would have resembled Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America. Great place for dates and teens to hang out, but it's not cheap given that it's very touristy. Parking used to be free with validation, but now it's pretty pricey. If you want to spend a couple days at Universal Studios and City Walk, get a hotel room in Universal City and take the shuttle back and forth. Hotels in nearby North Hollywood are cheaper, but most are not as nice as Universal Studios and 'hood can be sketch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
40,Great people watching & plenty to do,"We spent a few hours here, having dinner at Hard Rock Café and walking around looking at shops. For me it was not a must do when in LA, but if you have some hours to kill it is an interesting place to check out. There are a lot of restaurants and retail outlets but I suspect the merch is pretty expensive. Lots of yummy treats if you're needing a sugar hit. For us it was mainly just a cool place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CindyLyn
50,Just a fun place for tourists and locals alike,"I like stopping in for dinner several times a year. One can do that without buying entry to the park. When I do go to the park I like to find a discounted ""annual pass"" and go a few times each year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
30,Disappointing,Great for chain restaurants and gimmicky sugar ladened food but otherwise there’s little reason to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1DeniseS
50,Love it here,It gets busy but that’s because it’s so good. We stayed in the Hilton about 5 minutes away for a few nights and city walk has lots of places to eat so we were here most nights. Bubba gump was always great!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrincessPanoullie
50,Great Place to People Watch,Universal Citywalk Hollywood is a fun place to visit. It has tons of restaurants and shopping and has something for the entire family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuarts813
30,Super commercial. Supenr fun.,"Capitalism at its best. You want to go into every store, you pick up stuff and think ""this is great"" but then consider that you really have no use for it. But great fun to look. Upper end resturants had good food and fun... but very pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Venture21613
50,Great trip,Took a business trip out to Cali and went to visit universal city. Since going to florida and visiting universal studios this was a must see. We did the entire park in 4 hours. Hit every ride and had a few good drinks along the way. Kid friendly even though we didn't take any. Lots of old hollywood stuff to see and the working studios lot was great to see where a lot of movies are filmed. Highly recommend visiting this place. Purchase the fast pass. Worth its money. Skip to the front of the line!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriscE5347UI

30,An Evening of Fun with my Pips,It was a lovely Saturday Evening out with Friends and it culminated with dinner for 5 at Bucca Di Beppo Italian Restaurant where we had the traditional Italian Spaghetti and Meatballs. It was indeed a lovely night out,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ifeanyiudu
40,Worth a visit,We went over to City Walk as our hotel (The Garland) offer a free trolley if you’re staying in the hotel. We weren’t able to go into the park due to the fact I was expecting.But I have to say we enjoyed the walk around City Walk. We got our dinner on both nights in LA. There is plenty of options for all budgets.We enjoyed it! Definitely recommend it even if you’re not going into the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dundalk84
30,It’s a mall,"Went to get a Dodgers jersey from Dodgers Dugout, $25 to park but I got around that by doing the Valet and eating lunch for the meal deal at $7.The place is a mall, don’t get me wrong it’s a very nice mall and has stores you won’t find elsewhere but it’s still a mall.Get there early so it is less crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterlP2566QG

Of course after Horror Nights, we had to stop by Voodoo Doughnuts for a dozen delicious doughnuts",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomasviska
30,Shops and places to eat,"Lots of options for places to eat. We tried Hard Rock Cafe and it was awful - burger was tasteless and we were the only people in there.

50,A Fun Walk for Lovers,Before we were married my husband and then I went to Universal Studios and CityWalk. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe and visited most all of the shops. There was plenty to do and lots to see! Super fun place for date!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColleenL10
20,Not worth the money,After spending the day at Universal we opted for here for dinner...big mistake! Waited 15-20 mins for a table although there was tables available. The menu selection is poor. Waiter was lovely and food served quickly but no fries with the burgers. Coke was vile..whole glass filled with ice and juice watered right down. Then you have lady buzzing about tables taking photos to sell back to you. First and last time here. Would have got a far better meal at Burger King or McDonalds for half/third of the price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodgersClan

50,One of My Choices to Spend Evening in LA,"Universal Citywalk Hollywood is a must visit place in the evening while in LA. It is beautiful especially at night with the lights. It has entertainment, dining and shopping in modern looks. It has a multi screen movie theater and indoor skydiving. There is one water fountain in the center and a huge display screen above multiplex showing movie information. Street performers like magicians and musicians can be spotted here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
20,entree to universal studios hollywood,this is simply commercial interest street set to entice visitors passing through on their way to universal studios - not a place to visit in its own right - general parking to city walk only makes it expensive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackh752
20,NO handicapped parking for non-US nationals apparently.,"Not a bad place to be but not terribly interesting either. We spent an hour wandering around and not really doing very much or seeing very much of interest. It just doesn't have the vibe of the Florida City Walk and the patrons looked a little bored and disinterested as a result.The biggest black mark is against the parking though. We travel with a person with a disability and a UK issued blue badge for parking in disabled parking spaces. The guy at the entrance refused to recognise the badge as apparently City Walk only allows disabled American people to park in disabled spaces. No joke, no exaggeration, those were his exact words.When I pressed the case a bit more, the guy told me it was ""I think something to do with the Sheriff's office."" Think about that now. The local sheriff is going to come into the parking lot, spend part of his busy day trolling the place looking for foreigners who have the audacity to park in a spot designated solely for the use of Americans. I'm still in shock and disbelief.I'm not saying it isn't ""something to do with the sheriff's office"". However, we spend several weeks a year in the US and up to this point had spent nearly a month in LA, and this was the first and only person to discriminate against us as non-Americans. Very dangerous and shaky ground if you ask me.In any event, we paid full-price and got parked right beside the City Walk entrance, closer than where the disabled spots are. Go figure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BennyDoran
40,Outdoor Walking Experience,"Universal City Walk is nice and makes you think of a small mall strip. It has restaurants, a movie theater, small vendors, people playing and selling their CD's, stores to shop at, stores to get sweet treats, popcorn store, chocolate store, clothing stores, athletic apparel stores, an area where you have water shooting up from the ground so kids and adults can get wet on those hot days, well lit up at night, a Universal Studios store and just walking minutes to or from Universal Studios. If you can, stay at a hotel that offers free shuttle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation_traveler_18
40,Fun walk - expensive everything,"CityWalk is right outside Universal Studios. You don't need a ticket to get in, but beware as the parking prices are steep. You can take Metro or rideshare there. It's a brisk little walk with some fun things to watch (live entertainment, shows, indoor skydiving). However, this is a tourist area with tourist pricing. So don't be surprised at what you pay for water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/748geoffp

50,Beautiful night lights,My girlfriend and I passed through Universal CityWalk Hollywood when we parked our vehicle. Its beautiful especially at night with the lights. Fun experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevind473
30,ONLY FOR SEEING,Cityworks is actually located in the other side of Universal studios. It has many restaurants and shops. We just had a walk after finishing the trip to Universal studios. I tried to buy some souveniers but the price was exorbitantly high. The food cost was also on the higher side and thus gone back to Hollywood.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DPMALLIC
50,Handy when visiting Universal Studios,"Next door to Universal Studios Citywalks is ideal to eat,drink or shop with a great selection of Restaurants,Fast food outlets,bars and shops.

20,Expensive,"We came here as we were visiting Universal Studios and you have to park here [ $25!!!!] Disney is $20 so we were expecting the same. Lots of restaurants and cake/sweet shops and all dearer than normal because of where they are. Universal studios if tiny compared to the Florida one. Hardly any rides and 1 was even closed! It's on 2 levels and on the ground floor there were only 2 rides! It takes a good 10 mins to get between floors and the best thing is the view of Los Angeles because you are so high up. Even the studio tour was disappointing and we were really looking forward to it. Wouldn't come back again, no comparison to the Florida one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91JC
20,Caro y pesado,"Money money money… all very expensive…You have already paid 25 bucks mínimum to park your car... Wait and see how much you´re gonna pay to enter the park… where you´re gonna find even more grossly overpriced stores...a bit of a consumer nightmare, to tell you the truth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cabesua
40,Hollywood vs. Florida Universal CityWalk,"Comparing the two locations I found the Florida less interesting than the California one. The shops were numerous and the walk interesting. Then we went on the Universal Studios, but the one in Florida surpassed the California with more rides and simulations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
40,Fun place,Lots of shops and food places. Good music playing and clean bathrooms. Great place to go after a day at universal studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T955SRjenniferr
40,Faster and Cheaper Way to Voodoo Doughnuts,"On this vacation we went to Universal City Walk again specifically to go back to Voodoo Doughnuts. This time we were more prepared…1) We went after 6pm to take advantage of the discounted parking-it’s normally $25 to park at Universal, but if you go after 6pm it’s only $10 (which is still a lot, but much more manageable). By parking in the Universal parking structure it made the process of getting to Voodoo a lot shorter than what we had to trek before (I won’t go into the details, but parking somewhere other than Universal’s parking can cause you a loooonnngggg walk-and most likely uphill). 2) We found if you park in the Jurassic section of Universal’s parking structure and then walk down just a short ways to the elevator banks and take those down to the City Walk level you will find you are practically at Voodoo’s doorstep. All you have to do once you leave the elevator banks is walk out to the City Walk area and turn right and then you’ll be face to face with the wonderfulness that is Voodoo Doughnuts. And by just following those two simple steps I suggested above, it can save you a looooootttt of time as well as a cool $15 too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielleeu9
40,Kind of like Downtown Disney -- But Not So Much,"This ""downtown"" area of Universal Studios offers a wide variety of restaurants and shopping places. We enjoyed both. I think that Tony Roma's is by far the best restaurant in this area, but you can decide for yourself. My wife is a Harry Potter fan and there is a Harry Potter shop there which we spent an eternity browsing. There is a neat collectibles store, many places for T-shirts, caps, and so on and on. It does seem to lack a lot of focus, however. So,it is really very much like a ""downtown"" area of a small town with a little of everything. If you have been to Downtown Disney, you will definitely see the resemblance, but Downtown Disney is more focused and I think superior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thegeese
40,Night walk,"Lovely night walk. Better do the walk and the theme park separately if you are staying close by that allows you to walk there within 15min, as parking is very expensive $25 a day, while free shuttle bus is located at the bottom of the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/94kristalw
50,A very nice place for walking,"This is a very nice place to walk just before you enter Universal Studios park. There's many shops and restaurants, I like the colors and decoration. At night , there's a Huge screen that broadcast live people dancing in the square. We had dinner at an Italian restaurant there and everything was really Superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samirk381
50,Walking under the Lights and STars,"I love to walk at Universal City Walk. It feels safe, it's almost a Disneyland for Adults. While there are no rides, there's enough to do there while you're walking around. Great food options, and movie theaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/897pattyt
50,Nice place to enjoy an evening,"This place is very nice if you are looking to find a simple family space.

30,Walk,Nice but not a lot of stores to go into or things to go after universal studios. Need better stores and more things,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79jasminer
50,Awesome place to go after the theme park closes,"As anybody that has been to Universal Studios Hollywood will tell you, the shopping plaza outside is a great place to spend time after the theme park closes for the day, all the store's and restaurant's large neon signs light up and music can be heard coming from the massive screen in the plaza centre. Walking through at dark feels like you are in Sin City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadartemis

The restaurants here include Hard Rock Café (where we ate), Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant, Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. (seafood), Wasabi at CityWalk (sushi), Camacho's Cantina (Mexican), Dongpo Kitchen (Chinese), and more. Good place to chill-out, shop albeit at high prices, but some items look unique and dine. I like it best at night when it is all lit up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KodoDrummer
50,Good choices of food,"Went to find dinner and so many great restaurant choices! Ended up at Margaritaville.

10,Home Loan,I've been titled this review home loan because if you think Disneyland is expensive you haven't seen nothing yet until you get to Universal Studios or Universal CityWalk you need a bank loan before you walk in the front door. I cannot believe that a hamburger with cheese and an order of french fries is $35 a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with one slice of garlic toast $40 absolutely pathetic and absurd to pay these type of Crisis just because you want to be in Universal City walk or Universal Studios.Travelers are going to come to Universal CityWalk or Universal Studios anyway despite the price I'm just giving you a heads up in a warning that it's really a travesty that Taurus have to pay so much just to have a little piece of Hollywood with a picture and friends and family to share with others.As an alternate you should visit Griffith Park this is an area of Los Angeles that was donated to the city back at the turn of the century . Los Angeles City Zoo Travelers town where they have a collection of trains that you can climb aboard and a little choo-choo train for the children that runs around the park this is all free it holds Great Value and family fun.I am giving Universal CityWalk a generous one ☆ star Rating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sogonblick

30,Could have more...,"I didn't want to compare Universal Citywalk to Disney's, but you can't help it. I wanted MORE shops and More Earteries, but alas, I was disappointed with the 'closed spaces' and lack of variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petraFIED69
40,Gate way to fun,"After walking up the Steep hill, and Struggling with the Baby’s pram then Realizing I could of just taken a free universal studios shuttle to the park I was so annoyed I won’t be make that mistake again. The shuttle service Arrives every 10 -15 mins after 7am so Definitely look out for the signs. City walk is you being to the Entertainment side of things, from Cinemas, to I-fly which Stimulates the Skydiving experience with out jumping out of the plane, clubs bars and Restaurants and food shops and many more, I do Prefer city walk in Orlando Florida but both good places to hangout .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/82lloydm

40,A good time killer,"I have read a lot of reviews that said its not worth the $25 parking tag. I would have to disagree. First off, its California. You're going to pay for everything and it'll be expensive. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the ""touristy"" paced walk through the CityWalk. They had some food stores and some great restaurants. It does resemble Downtown Disney in a sense but unlike Disney there is only one store that's Universal themed, the rest are mall type stores. I would go back to try the different restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SightCeeR
40,Plenty of glitzy touristy places to eat and spend money.,"Hard Rock cafe was our choice and the food and staff were really good.Standard touristy place to eat and spend money, when you're in the mood for glitzy, touristy spending.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghade63
30,Not a destination on its own,"This was a nice little place that I mistakenly took my teenage son to one day, thinking it was something like Downtown Disney. It is not like that at all. It is much, much smaller. There are a few stores, a few restaurants, all of which are fun to look through or dine at, but none of which are worth traveling to on their own and paying $25-$35 to park at. Just save Citywalk for a day that you are otherwise going to Universal Studios, because you have to walk through Citywalk to get in or out of Universal anyways, unless you pay for the very most expensive parking at the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmenot
40,Touristy shopping and dining...,"We love city walk Orlando and came to the Hollywood version for a bit of shopping, it is much smaller than Florida but still very good.There is a great selection of shops including Universal parks merchandise and a huge selection of chain restaurants. Including Voodoo Donuts (with a slightly more PG menu!)This place is touristy and overpriced but a lot of fun. There is loads to do and see and its worth a visit if you enjoy that kind of thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurajtravels88
40,Touristy & Overpriced but still love it!,"Im a local and I love the CityWalk, sure parking can be expensive if you don't attend a movie and its very touristy but that is the draw. You are looking for a cosmopolitan crowd where you can eat a decent meal and people watch the international tourists and locals alike mingling. Its a getaway. I love the Dongpo Noodles and there is also a unique donut store here called VooDoo Donuts. Its a great place to pick up local Los Angeles souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Sensory overload,"Like being on a PG version of the Vegas strip. Jam packed with restaurants, shops, a cinema, iFly, and even a dueling piano bar city walk does not disappoint. Go after dark and enjoy the stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brenda-blmhouston
40,Much Smaller than CityWalk in Orlando,Good spot to eat and shop while at Universal as the lines are typically shorter as you're not within the main park. Pretty typical fare and chain restaurants along with souvenir shops. The tram to the bottom of the hill/metro station has a stop right outside the CityWalk area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/165sabrinau
50,Good shopping and food,"There is lots of shopping and good food here! They also have great places for photo-ops. This also connects directly to Universal Studios, so if you don't want to eat in the park or need a quick break, this is a great place to go to. It is also good to walk around in the evenings to go to dinner and have something fun to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paigemcfarland21

30,Closes at 9pm,"It appears that Universal wants all the tourists to go to bed at 9pm. The shuttle stops running at 9pm and all the restaurants close at that 9pm witching hour. Knowing this and not wanting to wander all over LA to eat, we finished up our meal by 8:30pm and caught the shuttle back like good tourists. Not quite sure why everything shuts down early, but that was my takeaway from Citywalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradh556

50,Excitement and Entertainment,After a long day at Universal Studios we headed to the Universal CityWalk to get our nom on at Hard Rock Cafe and shop a little. Hooked myself up with some new Rainbows at the flip flop shop and was entertained by a live dance show (with the giant video screen) and the water fountain had probably 100+ people running through to see if they could make it without getting wet. VERY ENTERTAINING. Lots of people around (even at 1030 at night).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic

40,Very good but not as wonderful as Downtown Disney.,We all enjoyed Universal City Walk. It had a good variety of shops and restaurants. The Universal souvenir store is very good but doesn't have quite as much available as you will find in the actual Universal Studios. We had some pleasant meals here at places such as Bubba Gump. Well worth a visit or two.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodidella
40,Lots to eat and lots to do,"It doesn’t cost money to go to Universal CityWalk, just the cost of parking.

30,Typical tourist trap street,I am getting more and more sick of streets or shopping districts like this. If you have been to one you have been to them all. For the most part they have the same or similar type of places to eat and shop. But it is ok in terms of options and unique places to eat and shop compared to other similar city walks I have been to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yorosey
30,It's okay but I wouldn't travel far to visit.,"The city walk is an okay collection of shops and food outlets and worth a look if you're visiting Universal Studios.Prices are inflated as you would expect in a tourist precinct, but not outrageously so.So, it's worth having a sticky beak if you're already in the area but I wouldn't make a trip to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/685mickl

30,Stores and Restaurants and Walking Around,"This isn't so much an ""attraction"" as it is an outdoor mall. In and of itself, there isn't much to set it apart from other outdoor malls besides more of a ""you're near a theme park"" vibe.It was nice to walk around there at the end of the day at Universal. We ate dinner at CityWalk four times during our stay at the nearby Hilton, but we didn't necessarily seek out CityWalk for adventure- just mostly for food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethB02

I enjoyed a meal at Panda Express, bought some cool socks at the Los Angeles Sock Shop and resisted the urge to buy an expensive Huffelepuff sweatshirt.

Highly recommended,"Visited CityWalk on my birthday this year and really enjoyed it - haven't been here for 20 years and it's so much bigger and better! I remembered the hanging poster of King Kong, but little else and there are so many more cafes, restaurants and shops here. Skechers was a real find and the staff were lovely - I bought 2 pairs. The AMC Theater is great and so much choice for food everywhere. A great place to sit in a cafe with a drink and watch the crowds rolling in on a Saturday into the Studios next door. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopej594
40,"Birthday for my son, good stuff","My son wanted to go to Universal Studios for his birthday and we hadn't gone since the Harry Potter addition so even though it is pretty pricey we took the trip. Of course that trip would include a tour through the Walk.Parking is a pretty major problem though as only the obscenely expensive pass for Universal Studios included parking and it is $25, which should be valet level but is very basic.That money spent we went through City Walk in the way to the park and it has been a while and lots of changes. My favorite thing was the comic book store but the theatre is also cool. We also went to the Hello Kitty store which my daughter loved.Overall the Walk is pretty cool and we will be going to several other places. On this visit we just walked through several stores and only bought at a few. We ate at Margaritaville which my family enjoyed.I do recommend the Walk but make sure you have a destination to justify the parking whether that is the theme park or some other place. Check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frodolives11954

There is a sock store, Hot Topic that was big, Universal Studio Store, Sweet, plus many others. Lots of restaurants from quick to sit down. Including Bubba Gump, Johnny Rockets, Panda Express, there was a pretzel and popcorn store, chinese I think too, hamburgers, sea food, Hard Rock Cafe. You seriously cant go hungry if you visit here and need to eat and shop til you drop after the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breanne07

We walked to the very end by the entrance to Universal Studios. We were pleasantly surprised they were taping Extra with Mario Lopez and two girls from The Bachelor!! Tia and Kendall were there!! It was so much fun to see them and be in the background. My daughter got a photo with Tia. The Bachelor final shows were going to be on that evening and the next. I wish we could find out where and when Extra would be on tv so we could see it. It was hard to find on any television guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787maryjaner

40,"Fun, Eclectic, Interesting","This is a popular walk, and deservedly so. There are all kinds of eclectic shops, lots of fun visuals, and great places to eat.There is something here for every budget, but caters best to fun clothes and souvenirs.You can find basically any type of food you'd want for a meal, and LOTS of places to get sweets afterwards. There are movies to see, and iFly lets you ""freefall"" in full view of all the passing tourists.Be sure to try to go at night, because the lighted signs and fountains add a particular fun and beauty to the experience.Parking can be a bit steep ($25), but for a car full of people, it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holden236

30,Nice stroll...food and shopping options,"Nothing too great to report--- fun food locations like popcorn and donuts and some good shopping, but it seems to be a bit overpriced since they have a captive audience from the park. Worth the trip if you are in the park, otherwise you can skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurilie513

40,Nice walk with lots of neon lights and fun locations to visit,"Totally a tourist destination. Many really good restaurants and lots of novelty shops surrounded by neon signs, music, overhead movie screens and the like. Fun for adults and children of all ages. Parking is very steep, though. If you go to a movie, they'll reduce your parking fee (to $5, I think.) Can get crowded on Saturday nights in the summer, but most of the rest of the year, it's a lot of fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868

50,"lots of light, nicely crowded place","i love this place as a tourist not probably as a local, it is so colorful and lots of lights and the logo of the shops is funny and different, the food probably not the best but it is fine.it is always crowded and this is the most amazing thing about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anasjabeiti

40,A Tale of Two Walks,"This is really Universal City's Disneyland walk. It's an area that you literally walk through to get to the park and is filled with restaurants, some shops and you can even go dancing or to a movie including Imax movies. What's not to like? The restaurants are all of what I'd call upmarket casual dining for families and couples. Bubba Gumps, Buca di beppo, 3 broomsticks, Dongpo Kitchen etc. No problem for lunch but you might want to make reservations for dinner and afterward leave and go somewhere else for your evening. The clientele is markedly different between daytime and nighttime and a teenage testosterone overload makes for a needless scuffle or two or three in the evening from 9pm onwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
50,Perfect place to shop,Lots of shopping & dining outlets for every budget. The place is vibrant and bustling with people at all hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mitzlife
40,A Fun Place to Kill Some Time or Go for Date Night,"Universal CityWalk Hollywood (like its sister location in Orlando) is 3-block long outdoor Dining/Retail/Entertainment district located right outside the front gate of the Universal Studios theme park. It is comprised of more than 30 places to eat (from walk up locations, to quick service sit-down restaurants and more upscale establishments), numerous retail locations (including Fossil, Element, Billabong, Hot Topic, the Universal Studios Store, etc.), and other entertainment options, such as a 19-screen IMAX Cineplex, iFly indoor skydiving, nightclubs, numerous street performers, live music, and the 5 Towers outdoor stage. It is large, high-energy, and fun...perfect for date nights or killing time before going to Halloween Horror Nights or for winding down after the park closes for the evening. The variety is excellent, the design is appealing to look at, and the parking prices are reasonable. Expect to pay slightly higher than normal prices to eat at places like the Hard Rock Cafe, Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville and other establishments.I have spent hours wandering through CityWalk enjoying the ambiance, people-watching, and enjoying an inexpensive dinner and free entertainment before. It is a great location for date-night and relaxing. Parts of CityWalk are covered under a roof, so you have places to go for shelter in case of inclement weather as well.A trip to Universal isn't complete without grabbing a bite to eat and spending a little time at CityWalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jakeg485
40,Evening shopping,It gets crazy busy around the time that universal closes. Trying to get dinner is a mission if you are on a time limit and being picked up as we were. There was live music with a trio of young men playing an accordion and electric cello and fiddle - very good especially standing under one of the restaurant heaters- when the sun drops it gets cold so wrap up. Some cute shops and a lot of restaurants including Hard Rock and Bubba Gump.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CNWgtnNZ
30,Overcrowded!,Pros-Theres so much things to do and always new things coming up.Cons-Its super overcrowded and at certain times you have trouble just moving around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isabellablanco
50,"Fun, entertaining and shopping",After spending the day inside Universal Studios we spent the evening taking in all the sites and many shops along City Walk. Lots of activities and shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terie802
50,The true and amazing essence of Hollywood/SF Valley CA,"I have been going to Universal CityWalk Hollywood since early 90s. And I must say it has gotten better every time. The restaurants, the theater and the attraction shows are just great. The bars are unique and original and it captures the feel of the Hollywood/Valley. I miss it and go there when I get the chance in order to enjoy a nice meal and reminisce over some good memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wolfman1972

30,Thought it would be larger,"I really thought CityWalk would be larger and have more to do and see. There were plenty of restaurants, but not as much shopping as the website makes it seem. Yes, I realize that it's supposed to be a prelude to the theme park, but I think if there were more to do that it could be a bigger draw for locals and tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaniC4590
50,Great experience,We visited Citywalk the day before going to Universal Studios. It was a great idea to do this because it saved us time and we were able to spend more time in the park as we had already seen Citywalk.Great day spend walking around looking through the shops and then having lunch at Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissarg95
50,Great evening,We got Metro Red Line 802 to Universal Plaza and walked over walkway to tram up hill to Citywalk. Very convenient and easy. Enjoyed the evening walking around as it was Halloween and most people were dressed up. Margaritaville for nibbles and cocktails. Staff great and happy hour fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ltweed
40,Great Atmosphere,"We had a lot of fun walking through Universal City Walk! It was definitely a unique shopping experience with great restaurants. Although the parking was $25, it was well worth it. The holiday music and videos playing on the big screen enhanced the overall atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJatan
50,"Fun, fun, fun",There is so much to see here. Going at night is beautiful. The lights and store signs exhilarate you. Watching people go through the jumping water is entertaining. Make sure you have some cash on you because you’ll be tempted to buy something. The parking alone is $25!!!! Also a camera is handy because there are lots of places for a photo-op. This place is a must-see when in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno
40,A fun place with good restaurants,"A nice, fun place to visit. Really nice with all the lights at night time. Has some great shops and great restaurants, including Bubba Gump's Shrimp. The water fountain display is a nice added touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElvisFann
50,Brilliant,Really loved Universal city. Really vibrant and lots to do. I ate at a sports diner that was very nice and great price. Some lovely shops also. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wolf-Lady07
50,The city full of entertainment,"Even a day ain't enough to explore this city. With games, rides and entertainment options, you'd be tired by evening. The train ride to the studios is an absolute must as it takes you through so many adventurous places, like a Mexican city will flood as you pass by, a train station will get on fire and a train will slip in front of you! Yet it's safe as everything is dramatised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sahilbanga
40,Variety and a cool venue,"Round up the usual suspects in upper level chain restaurants and add a touch of Hollywood for city walk. Hard rock, bubba gump, candy stores, crepes and bAR type food with a giant gorilla hanging above and dancing fountains below. A good place to eat, esp wit kids or if u don't have time for the amuse ment park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CONSTANCEB832
20,EXPENSIVE!!!,"I know this is mainly a tourist sight, but it used to be cool to go just to go and hang out, but now the parking is $25! Now you have to be a tourist just to be able to afford it! INSANE!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,"Fun, Fun, Fun","I love looking at the stars on the Walk of Fame, visiting all the hot tourist spots, and people watching. That's my favorite part. Watching the scammers scam and the tour guide buses fight for customers; when they all go to the same exact places.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynNetterBug
50,Lots of great entertainment!,"Tons of shops, restaurants and things to do. The lights at night are fabulous as is the live entertainment in the evenings. We listened to a violinist who played pop music that was amazing! A really fun place to visit and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Love2travelPHX
40,"The word ""lively"" really doesn't do CityWalk justice!","Adventure awaits you up on ""Universal Mountain"" as I like to call it =) Bright lights, loud music and tons of LED screens makes it feel like a mini Vegas. There's something to do for everyone. Prices are a bit outlandish, but it's your classic Hollywood tourist trap; even though we locals like to revel in it every so often. Prepare yourself for HEAVY crowds on the weekends, especially in the summer. Parking can be a bit extreme, but I'll give you a tip that a few of the restaurants will validate for parking, so keep that in mind if the $25 bucks puts you off. You can always park at the metro station and walk up the hill/take a shuttle - which may or may not be free! But honestly, if you have some family in from out of town and want to give them the Hollywood experience, this is just the ticket!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lamamma1970
40,Evening with Teens...,"After a day at the Studios, we headed into CityWalk. We did some window shopping although most of the stores are very similar to those inside the park. We ate at Blaze which was consistent for the Blaze chain. That night there was a free concert so as we ate we watched the performers and people dancing in a sectioned off area just in front of the movie complex.As we left, the boys decided to play in the dancing fountain. Oddly enough I think they enjoyed dodging the water (and getting wet too!) as much as they enjoyed time inside the Studios. It was a relaxing and entertaining time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_leland_
40,Nice place,"I felt this was a nice place to transition to after a day in the park. The theming was continued, there were good shops, restaurants and snacks available. We stopped at voodoo donuts and Tony Roma’s and enjoyed both visits. I’m not sure I would come here if I wasn’t visiting the park but it was a great place to go to after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/832clarec
30,Mainly restaurant area,This is primarily geared for dining experience. There r some very good restaurants there and I would recommend making a reservation on open table before hand. A few stores there but nothing particularly different. There is a very cool water interactive feature in plaza. Probably more fun when it’s hot but a few kids didnt let the cooler weather stop them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422jh
40,Good Area for Shopping and Food,"CityWalk is a good source of food and entertainment while you're at Universal. We went to Star Wars IMAX 3D the first night we arrived, then went back for lunch and dinner while at the park the following day. Both Bubba Gump and Karl Strauss have good food, and Voodoo Donuts is a must for dessert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frostydg
50,Food,This is an amazing place plenty to choose for food and shopping my favourites were hard rock cafe and johnny rockets lovely food and there's now a cinema in there.it can get busy there but well worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paul67utb
40,A nice exit from the Park,"We visit Universal Citywalk Hollywood on Christmas day 2017....it is so crowded, the street, resto, cafe are full of people, we must wait 30-60 minutes to dine. We see many well known brands there like Hard Rock Cafe, Tony Roma's, Karl Strauss Brewery Co etc. Many people ""play"" with colourfull water fountain line that on and off....yet it is cold here. Nice place to visit especially in the evening after finishing the Park. For the record....everything is overpriced inside the Universal Studios Hollywood, and Citywalk is like main street just outside the Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eljees
50,You gotta come here at least once!!,"If you happen to be going to Universal Studios, there's a good chance that you will be passing through this area at least twice that day. So many shops! So many places to eat! Wanna watch a movie afterwards? Go ahead!! You can definitely spend the whole day here. Brings lots of money though!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/293joyceg
40,Nice citywalk with a bunch of stores!,You have the option to have a bunch of stores in a few blocks together. Different options and a lot of restaurants/fast food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seby66
50,So much fun!,Wish we could have spent time walking through and watching all that was going on but we were beat down tired. We did love the new mini monster tea that had just opened. I hope they stay.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geriz2018
40,Water/light show- best at night,"There is a cool water/light show in the evenings that the kids can enjoy getting wet at (change of cloths) Avoid “It’Sugar” a candy store at CityWalk where they still sell candy cigarettes of all things!!!! “Pinks” at CityWalk is supposed to have good hot dogs, but we ate on the deck at Karl Strauss overlooking CityWalk’s main center. It was OK- all your going to find here is the typical chain restaurants, but better than in the park. CityWalk is just outside the park gates- a quick and easy walk and worth the visit after enjoying Universal’s Theme Park. It’s best at night. If you are only going to be at CityWalk for 2 hours you should valet park by the Jurassic Parking Garage= $7 for 2.5 hours if you get your ticket validated at a restaurant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliforniaCruizen
30,Try to combine your visit when you go to the park,"I just moved to SoCal, and decided to go there for a visit. Had to pay $25 for parking. the area is OK. Try to combine the visit when you go to the park. You will have to pass through the CityWalk no matter what.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biztravel_Den
50,Lovely place and great eating,"Nice shops and loads of places to eat. We went for pizza at Blaze... great taste of wood fire pizza and resonable prices ,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104nitinp
40,Such a fun place!,"The shops here have things you can’t find anywhere else (such as Harry Potter chocolate frogs). If you want the best Universal Studios merchandise but don’t want to pay to go in to the park, this is the place to go! Love the selection of restaurants from Hard Rock to Bubba Gump. There is a movie theater and other fun attractions.Parking tip:Do NOT go in to the parking garage and pay the $25 fee that people going to the amusement park pay. Instead, head over to the valet where you will pay $7 for up to 2.5 hours if you get the ticket validated by a restaurant that offers sit down dining!Universal Studios store/AMEX tip:If you use your AMEX at the Universal studios store and spend over $75, the cashier will give you 10% off. You may have to mention the offer to the cashier as it’s hit or miss if they will offer it to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhxMermaid
20,"Not worth the hype, or $25+ to park just to walk around!","My brother came to town and we wanted to see Citywalk. General parking STARTS at $25 and that is whether you are there to walk around, window shop, eat, or go to the movies! We parked offsite and got a Lyft back up to Citywalk for $4 each way.Citywalk is okay, but nothing special. It is a bunch of stores and restaurants you can find offsite in any open-air malls. I only noticed two bathrooms to service the ENTIRE Citywalk and both of them were WAY smaller (approximately 4-5 stalls/urinals each) than the demand, as they were overused and people were waiting in lines out the door for both the men and women!The iconic Universal globe has riot gates set up all around it, preventing people from getting closer than about fifty feet and looks weird having the gates.All in all, Citywalk is not worth the hype and definitely not worth the $25+ to park! Go to Downtown Disney for a much better, more affordable experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blankscan
30,Basically an Open Air Mall,"Wasn't expecting this to be as cookie cutter as most malls. The restaurants, on the other hand, were certainly different and I did enjoy walking around outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeXit98

40,Great place with a fab vibe,"Loved this place. I like being able to wander and window shop, or to stop and listen to a band or a singer. It's full of great eateries, a cinema and shops. The hotel where we stayed had a free courtesy bus which meant easy access to this place during the day.Most importantly the place is spotlessly clean and well looked after!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliG7127
40,Worth a visit when going to Universal Studios,"Visited here one day in late Nov 2017. Ate brunch here first before going into theme park. Better food here than in park (Ate at Poké place/Pink burger). Many shops, cinemas. Came here once before 9 years ago and went to cinema here after theme park. Free shuttle bus from metro station (red line) stops right outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polymoog
50,This place gets better & better,We visit Universal/City walk every few years and I’m always happy to see our favorite regular eats and also new shops that pop up like mini monster.

Love the lights and live music.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PalmTreeKelly
40,Fun Fun Fun!!!,I went there for a movie and dinner with my family and it was a blast. So much to do and see!! We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe which was the standard with great service. Did some people watching along the City Walk also great stores for shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregJ1964
50,nice place to go after a day in the theme park.,"Lost of Shops, Restaurants,bars , Cinema and plenty of universal themed shops around. A few famous names like Bubba Gump and Voodoo Donut here also. If you have missed any souvenirs at the park itself you are bound to be able to find them here somewhere. We ate at Bubba gump here. Long wait on a table but was it was nice relief to finallly get seated after being on our feet all day. Wanted to go back and just visit the Citywalk alone but didn't get the chance ended up running out of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster

40,Fun after Universal,We went for dinner after Universal closed. Be prepared for a wait everywhere. We went to Bubba Gump's. 45 minute wait but good food under the heaters outside. Shops were fun and different to look at but expensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amber1127
50,Lots to see here,Just outside the theme park. Plenty to see and do. Upscale shops and bars but everything is pretty pricey.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickg803
40,Surprisingly fun,"I was not expecting this to be something we would enjoy. I'm not much of a shopper. We had a great time just walking around, looking at the lights and having dinner outside a restaurant with live music going in the street. My daughter loved to play in the fountain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelleyf947
40,Walk the Walk,"We have been here many times....never been disappointed. Universal Citywalk has great shops and great places to eat. Our favorite eats are found at Margaritaville and the Hard Rock Cafe. The AMC theater here is outstanding. They play All of the current movies and the seats...,the seats are extremely comfortable and so relaxing. They are like lazy boy chairs....we almost did not want to leave. The atmosphere at Citywalk is fun and exciting. If you get a sweet tooth, they have candy shops and a very yummy doughnut shop....Voodoo doughnuts. Overall, Universal Citywalk is a great place to hang out and have fun. I almost forgot.....save your parking permit. If you go see a movie, the theater will give you cash back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daddy1020
50,See the Stars,"See the Hollywood stars! But be leery of celebrity impersonators. They seem friendly when they approach you, but they want to be paid for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/573lizt
50,Fun! Great food!,"City walk had lots of shops and restaurants to choose from. Conveniently located across from the Hilton Universal hotel. Free shuttle provided by Hilton as well.

50,It's like a mini Vegas at night...Except no Casino's,"Love visiting this place at night after a day at Universal Studios, I truly recommend taking in a movie at the upgraded movie theater with reclining seats after walking all day. Jimmy Buffett's Bar is must stop at night, it's lively and fun and you will get a great drink. So many food options to name here, but the Sushi restaurant is awesome and the Chinese restaurant next to it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronmiller0032
40,Entertaining and Alive,"This place is always packed with people. There is plenty to do for people of all ages: shopping, movies; dining; live entertainment; games; etc.I like the long and narrow walk ways of City Walk. It feels comfortable and like you are enclosed in a safe place. Great place for families, couples, or just to do some shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth
50,Visit at night,Loved visiting this area. Right next to Universal Studios. We visited on a balmy night. Lit up it's quite an experience. Heaps of restaurants and great shopping. All well priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/296sharona
30,"Nice walk, typical shops","This place was OK, well kept and even a little entertaining, but it was a quick walk around. They had that typical lineup of restaurants and stores that you would expect. Touristy of course. I would’ve probably enjoyed it more at night then in the day. Took a little day trip just to hang out at this place and it’s not enough on its own during the day to keep your attention. If you go to watch a movie at night, dinner at night, see one of their concerts or something it would probably be better. Daytime is not really the time to go unless you’re going to continue into the theme park itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pizzaexplorer
40,Plenty of choice to extend your stay.,"If you've had a great day at the park - what better way to end the day then take walk down the CityWalk. There are lots of restaurants, attractions, shops and boutiques on the city walk - there is even a multi-screen cinema.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/263markj
40,Food and Shopping,A great place to find chain restaurants that will provide consistent and quality you can count on. We ate there several times and found the food and drink satisfying and delightful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobR623
40,Great Place to Unwind after visiting Universal Studios,"There are many shops, retails stores and restaurants wherein you can relax after a tiring day exploring the nearby Universal Studios. From the fast eats to fine dining , you can have it here. Be wary however of the throngs of tourists who arrived at the same time, they fill popular places up. Wifi is free so you can do some browsing at the complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doctorfoxtrot
30,"VERY EXPENSIVE, staff was unpleasant and rude.","Purchased several products from multi stores (Voodoo donuts, socks store, and Dodgers store) all staff was unfriendly, NOT helpful and rude. Prices are very expensive, not budget friendly. Nothing you cant get online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/athenad2013
10,Security is TERRIBLE!!,"Security is horrible at Universal City Walk!! Young guys not at all mature with attitudes. It’s unbelievable that security guards can have such a financial impact on clients for Universal?! The power they have given these guys is not good for their business. They can just take theme park tickets away from you if they choose to as you walk through City Walk! We had a group of 8 50ish year old women who rarely go out to anything and security picked us out of a crowd of people walking. They took 3 RIp tickets from us.. they said we were uncooperative which was absurd!! 2 girls had red solo cups in their hand. One with water and the other had Diet Coke. Somehow they equated that to open container!! It was the craziest thing I have ever witnessed. We spent $300 a ticket and 5 of us didn't enter. 2 of our 5 had driven 2 hours, took off from work to have their first experience at the Horror Nights. I was the third to have my pass taken because I was livid and went off on the guards after their insinuations and decisions to revoke 2 passes..not to mention their unbelievable attitudes. We weren’t even close to the entrance to the park when we were walking through City Walk and got stopped and told our tickets were not going to be valid.I have never had such an awful experience ANYWHERE!!! Our attorneys are going to handle it but it was not enjoyable at all!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mannisto
30,Glamorous on screen not in real life,"We were not expecting cameras and red carpet. However we also were disappointed in the whole experience.Very dirty and very overrated.Do this as a tourist attraction but don't expect to spend a full day.A must on your list but beware it will disappoint, we are glad we saw it another thing off our bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I7934ILsamanthas
40,Food and shopping,"I love the way California has done these eating and shopping areas at the theme parks (downtown Disney as well) it adds to the buzz of the day. Dropped off by our Lyft driver I thought he had brought us to the wrong place but as you walk past the car parks you are greeted with many shops and restaurants. So much to see and do, we explored more at night after our full day at universal studios. All in all you will walk through here when going to universal studios are just come visit regardless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jazzydzioba
40,A lot to do here - not just a detour before Universal Studios,"There are a ton of shops here for getting candy, snack items, souvenirs and lunch or dinner. The little kids on a hot day will like the interactive fountains, so if you bring a change of clothes with you, it's fun on a hot day to let the kids play for a little while. It's not something that you can leave your kids to do while mom and dad wander off, though. You do need to stay with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerBobN
50,Feels like a free theme park,Shopping and restaurants are an upgrade to Universal Studios Park and fun to people watch. It feels like you are within the theme park as it is not like most malls you have visited,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diverdoon
50,Very fun place to end your day after visiting the attraction,"Try visiting Hard Rock cafe with it's amazing guitar and enjoy the very wide variety of restaurants at the citywalk, also they have a comic store that sells genuine comic characters which was really great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnawito
40,A Good Variety,"It seems they keep expanding this, or something. It seems like this was twice as many places available throughout this area. We had parked in the general parking, where you have a nice long walk from the garage to the front of the park. So you stroll by a number of unique shops, as well as the classics like Hard Rock, Bubba Gump Shrimp, movie theater and so on you see in some other touristy areas around the country.No shortage of options to eat at or to spend the last of your money on the way back to your vehicle after a long day in the parks. It is a nice area, and they offer any number of different after dark opportunities from what we had been told and saw on their advertisements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,"A perfect place to end your ""Universal studios"" visit","After enjoying the day at Universal Studios, what could be better then walking to your car through this vibrant and amazing walk. offering you a great variety of shops and dinning options, it really makes you end your day on a high. Bubba Gumb shrimp co is our favourite dinning place there, for the great service and value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sidaros
40,Fun Concept but Not Too Much to Do,"The CityWalk is a “nice to have” feature of Universal. Ultimately it softens the blow of having to end your day at the park because you can just head on over to the CityWalk and continue to have fun! Well...kind of.There are a ton of places to eat and drink here but it also feels super touristy. You will have Margaritavilles and Hard Rock Cafes more often then a unqiue restaurant that isn’t a chain. You can spend your time browsing the gift shops, grab a bite to eat or something to drink, but after that you’ve pretty much done it all at the Citywalk. My husband and I always get so excited about the Citywalk concept but never find enough to hold our attention for longer then 2 hours. Definitely grab dinner here and walk the length of it, but there probably won’t be much else for you to do here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinestaszko

50,I Enjoyed My Visit,"We were on a western tour, and had a few hours of free time in the afternoon. So decided to spend it at the Universal City walk. It beats sitting in your hotel room.We really wanted to go to the park but it would not have been worth paying the money for only a few hours.The City Walk is great for fun photo opts, and for dining.If you like to shop, this is the area to do it. Everything from Universal items to Jimmy Buffet articles. There is a great Harry Potter store.It is Free to walk around here and you can stay as long as you like.There are no rides in this area. You walk further down and buy your ticket to enter the actual park.We ate in Jimmy Buffet Margaritaville and it was a wonderful lunch.the waiter and a manager were both at our table assisting. So very pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fizzyfil
50,CityWalk has everything,"City Walk has everything you could want! If it hadn't been for the fact that I had been walking around Universal Studios the whole day and was tired AF, I would have loved spending more time here doing window shopping and visiting the restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/verniceb2018
50,Great place to visit,Free shuttle service from either the Hilton or the Sheraton that is located right there. Lots of restaurants to choose from depending on what you want to eat along with a variety of shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/db01906

50,Universal City Walk Hollywood,"We went to City Walk Hollywood to enjoy the new Margaritaville. The cheeseburger was delish as always and the service was stellar. The Hard Rock Hotel still served the best cocktails. Loved the general vibe of the city walk. We were there in the AM on a rainy day and there were very few other people, but I could see how exciting the night life could be. Loved the location and the Voodoo Doughnut shop. Yum! I recommend a few minutes to look thru the shops on your way to Universal Studios, but as a destination, probably not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joell2002
50,Worth a visit for even if not going to Universal Studios but really ideal for dinner after a day at Universal,"Unless you want to pay $10 extra for VIP parking at Universal Studios, you will be forced to walk the ""Walk"" to and from the parking structure. That's not such a bad thing as it is an exceptionally well presented outdoor mall and dining destination. It almost feels like you are already in the theme park - giant guitar etc..Huge range of casual and family dining options (both sit down and food court) as well as ice creams/Cinnabon/donuts etc... A few shops as well but it it more about the dining. There is also an excellent movie cinema.Easy place to have dinner after a day at Universal or perfect if you are staying nearby. Even if you aren't, the Walk is worth a visit for a stroll around, people watching, and choice of dining.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Neulara
50,Good for folks staying onsite,If you are stating at the Sheraton or hilton the restaurants offer a good varied choice for an evening meal after a day at the park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Blondiemouse
30,Take a look if visiting Universal Studios,"I would not go out of my way to visit CityWalk. My recommendation would be to go after visiting the park next door. We did just that and went for dinner after a day at Universal Studios. It is nice and the lights are pretty after dark, but we found the crowd to not be family friendly at all. Take a look, visit a couple of shops and then leave before it gets too late (if you are visiting with kids of any age).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katabout
50,Relaxing place to take in the sites and get a bite to eat,"A nice place to walk around when you have some time. There is a wide variety of restaurants, stores and places to relax -- something for every taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR942
40,Vacation,"The place is well family oriented, very clean, nice stores and food area, price is variable $$ all depend what you want. Like it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noemin915
50,Awesome,You gotta spare sometime if you visit Universal Studios to come here and enjoy this very lively place. The place is just so nice and would be a nice wrap up to an awesome day at the studios. Some nice shopping to be done here if you are looking to get your universal souvenirs. Right at the middle there is also this awesome stage and mostly with some activities...singing and dancing over there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malnaser
40,Outdoor shopping mall,"Nice place to people watch. Clean mall adjacent to Universal. Fast food galore. Not a salad to be seen. After a couple of meals on the road kinda would like some salad. Mostly overpriced paid 12.00 for KFC 3 piece chicken tenders with coleslaw/potatoes and drink. Haven't had KFC for years, but that still seemed pricey. Husband and daughter had Smash-burgers with fries, very greasy 29.00. Guess it's to be expected. Other than the food prices, mall was clean and easy access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simplelife5
30,Useful for dinner break,Mainly shops restaurants and movie theaters.Went to a Mexican restaurant Camacho's. Fast service and good tortilla chips and margaritas. Had the enchiladas which were not bad (don't get the lobster one as too sweet). One nice touch was avocado dip that was prepared at table.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninol2016
40,Very Busy Very Hot But so rewarding,If you can dodge the random sale people selling cd's of their music etc you can get some wonderful photos of the stars and hand prints. a good few eateries are available as well as shops selling tourist stuff.Its HOT so take a small bottle of water or simply get one in one of the many shops available.very vibrant and exciting place to be but not great for getting a pic of the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/famousactor
50,Great for dinner and a movie,"If you're visiting the park, this is a great alternative for food instead of eating in the park. If you don't want to go to the park, then CityWalk is good for dinner and a movie or just to stroll around and window shop. The drawback is that there isn't much else to do. CitiyWalk is about quarter mile stretch of shops & restaurants and visiting just to see it might not be a good idea. Look up the restaurants and see if you could make a reservation if you're coming on the weekends because they can get booked quickly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaeldavid30
40,Amazing shops and restaurants!,"Either on the way in or out of the theme park, this place offers even more shops and more food outlets than anyone would ever need, with great brands, iconic sights and more souvenirs to buy, if you don't already have enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13StevenK

50,Amazing experience for everyone visiting LA!,This was very awesome to visit this area and to see the stars on the Walk of Fame. Great shops. Great restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/737BarbaraM
30,Pretty boring I would say but I'm sure others must enjoy,"Just took my visiting relatives here as they asked to see it. I live here but have never done this. All this is is names of stars/well known people embedded in the street on a type of copper plate and loads of people just taking pictures of them. And that's it, nothing more. But, it's free so if your going along Hollywood Blvd you may as well take a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
50,Fun Date Night,"with all of the Bistros and shops this is a fun place to go on a date night, There are theatres as well. People watching is a must, and once in awhile they have a concert. prices are moderate to expensive but fun is going to happen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melodiel534

40,"Clean, clean, clean","We stopped by while waiting for my son. We went thru the stores, bought chocolate, sunglasses and a spiderman figure for my nephew. Cool stores, very clean, tons of restaurants. I wouldn't go here specifically to eat dinner or have a drink but if you are dropping people off at the park or picking up its a good place to kill 2 hours. Most of the restaurants you will find elsewhere...Tony Roma's, Bubba Gump, etc, etc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jkarr11
50,Great!,"We came here after having spent 15 hours (!) at Universal Studios. We were hungry, needed to sit down and needed to have food super quickly. So, our choice to go to the Universal City Walk was a no-brainer as it is basically adjacent to Universal Studios. We thoroughly enjoyed it with its many shops, all the lights, water displays, lit up advertisements, etc etc etc. Last but not least there is a very good variety in restaurants that serve food until late and fast. We recommend going!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb382
40,Nice places to dine before and after or separately from a visit to Universal Studios,Just returned to University Studios 7/3/17 and it is a nice places to dine before and after or separately from a visit to Universal Studios.

40,Got to be done,Very busy place. Make sure you keep your kids close by. I would visit first thing in the morning to avoid the mad rush. This then gives you time to take pictures with out the pressure to do it quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905stephenm
50,Walking path before universal studios entrance.,Visited 8-25-17. Met family here. Music was playing on the stage while we were able to dance and have fun adjacent to the stage. We were dancing as we watched ourselves on an upper screen. Sat and ate at Johnny rockets. Lots of restaurants to choose from and other stores to make purchases like souvenirs doughnuts popcorn cotton candy coffee and more. Loved it and definitely recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynettam
40,Better selections then Universal studios,To me this place was better than Universal studios and had way better selections to see . The place and bathrooms were very clean. There are plenty of food options and shopping places. It wasn't that crowded and some really good photo opps. I would suggest checking it out there are some cool stuff to see .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lous593
40,Good for food and shops,"Visited the City Walk just to eat one night, we didn't visit the studios. Plenty of options for eats and a good number of interesting shops. Best to visit at night when things light up. Used valet parking which works out cheaper with restaurant validation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KiddyBoy
50,"Eating, Shopping, and Fun for All Ages","CityWalk is a great place to visit especially in the evening. There are countless eateries and snack bars including Frozen yogurt, donuts, seafood, pizza etc.. At night, you'll experience the big lights and some street performers. We enjoy the singing acts. There are many unique stores selling everything from specialty socks, stuffed animals and toys, to shoes, clothing, and of course plenty of souvenirs. There's a colorful water-play area - perfect for the hot summer months. There are clean restrooms and parking is available starting at $25. Universal CityWalk leads to Universal Studios Hollywood and is a great place to get dinner after a fun day at the amusement park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ahavaemunahl
30,Good place for a sit-down meal.,"Universal in general is too commercial and teen-based for my tastes. However, we visited the CityWalk due to its close proximity to our hotel and good restaurant reviews. Glad we ate there. I was surprised at the variety of restaurant choices and reasonable dining prices. Will avoid in the future, as it felt like a Teen Beat wannabe Times Square advertising hub.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine_titan
50,Great Surrounding Graphical Design,This place is very touristic and I would recommend getting your camera ready to take some of the most memorable souvenir around Universal CityWalk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Depasco

40,"Not worth a special trip, but nice for walking around after Universal Studios","We had 2 evenings here. We were staying at the nearby hotel and walked over for dinner. Even though it is a shopping mall, it really felt as if we were starting our vacation. The outdoor atmosphere was festive, and some of the shops were different from ones we have at home. The next evening, we came back after spending the day a Universal studios. Citywalk had better dining choices than the theme park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556helenk

40,"All very mass-produced, but something for everyone","We didn't spend a ton of time here because we just came to Universal City for the day, but if we had stayed closer by, we probably would have returned more often. The walk had some of the stores that teenagers love the most, several appealing restaurants, and a clean, inviting atmosphere. It's also spread out enough that we didn't feel too crowded or claustrophobic. Seems like they had plenty to offer both kids and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasMargs

40,Movies experience is stellar!,"AMC at universal city walk is worth it. I give 1-star for parking because they charge $25 but you get a $20 cash refund once your purchase the ticket. Stay inside the theater... each row has a leather lazy boy with electronic recliners and very wide spacious seats. It is totally worth it if you get your tickets at Costco.Buy the black tickets if you live in California. The yellow tickets do not work.

If people watching is your thing, there is always plenty of people there.This is a great place to meet on a first date, since you never have to settle on any one thing to do, you can do it all.Parking is horribly expensive.

40,Great shopping,"All the shops that a tourist could want in one area. A great range, fabulously helpful staff. Worth a visit, especially after being at Universal Studios (although after all that walking, it might have been more enjoyable doing this on a separate day).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matakanamum
30,Shopping center for non park goers,This is little more than an outdoor mall with a limited collection of stores but a few good restaurants make up for the otherwise bland atmosphere. You can get your Universal memorabilia here without having to enter the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveS27

40,Cool place for shops and food,"Parking was extremely easy. Would never be this easy in the Orlando, FL location. Tons of shops and food spots here. Lots of energy.

10,If you are a mall rat this is the place for you,I don't even know why this is an attraction on trip advisor. It is just a hyped up outside shopping mall area with all the crap you find anywhere in a America. Why travel miles to see something you have in your own city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BishkekFishlips
40,Good Ambience,"This is a good place if you want to stroll along and enjoy the ambiance. It has many restaurants, stores, and gift shops to choose from. The evening is a better time to visit because it often has entertainment and music.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayamax

40,"Fun, food, entertainment","If you are looking for a fun place to visit with food, entertainment, live street performances and cool things to explore, then City Walk Hollywood might be great place to take a date or the family. Seeing all things in one place makes this a one stop shop or do place to go. It's so much fun to take a day or an evening or spend the entire day and shop, eat, explore or see a movie, dance in the streets or take a selfie with Kong over your head. Whatever you do, it's bound to delight you and the family. The maverick experience",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crashmav

10,Awful.,"How is this place still open? What's the worst here?... The oversized signs that scream ""have fun!""; the touristy shops selling crappy gifts; the obscenely insane parking structures; or the mid-America collection of sub-par restaurants that offer a sampling or the worst of American mediocrity? All of it.This disaster of a place has never connected with Los Angeles its local market. It panders to the lowest of lows and keeps getting worse. The latest entry is a Jimmy Buffet restaurant that is embarrassingly out of place with food that tastes likes is was reheated in a frozen food bag.I would love this place to succeed, but it seems to get worse with time not better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TRVLtruth
40,Great shops & dining,"We didn't realize how cool this place was and didn't leave enough time to do all the shopping and dining we would have, but I took my 12 year old and her friend after going to Universal Studios for the day and they loved it.

40,Spend the day just people watching,"What a unique place to do some people watching, lots of restaurants, gift shops, music, and a movie theater. If you only have a few hours and want to visit a unique place visit the Universal City walk in Hollywood. Use the valet parking and eat it one of the restaurants and be a little park for only around seven dollars. That's if you time it just right there is no cost to get in but a lot of fun shops that are unique. They just opened a brand-new Voodoo Donuts which is pretty amazing, they also have this huge candy store that you can get just about any kind of candy there. Lot of Hollywood and movie memorabilia also sold their. Many good restaurants to choose from from Johnny Rockets and Buca di Beppo's just to name a few. There is also kind of a outdoor splash park with dancing fountains where kids can play and get wet. You usually have to walk through here to get to Universal Studios well worth it either before going into the park or after the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcatts

10,Terrible Experience,"Visited this place last June 25, 2017. Prior to going to the airport, my family wanted to see Universal Citywalk before catching their late night flight back to Manila. After about 2 hours of walking around, we headed back to our car only to find out that our van was broken into and 5 bags (supposed hand-carry) were all gone... including all the passports! This happened in broad daylight... 5-ish PM! After going to the Police Department (inside the citywalk) and reporting the incident... they reviewed their surveillance camera and 2 hours later confirmed that there was a car (black lexus... yup nice, decent car) that parked next to our van and a couple of guys appeared to be carrying some bags coming from our van back in their car. The thieves went back and forth 2x and were probably working on getting the rest of our stuff. Mind you... it's $20 to park! This experience caused us a lot of anxiety, stress and a bitter taste of Universal City.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badettes2015
50,You have got to see a movie at the AMC Theater,"I've come here to explore a lot of fun things before. One of the things I recommend is going to the main Universal store, and getting the giant simpsons doughnut, for only $5.99! It was actually really good! Addicting! I almost ate the whole thing by myself haha! I also highly recommend watching a movie at the AMC Theater here. They revamped the whole place, and the seats!! My goodness!!! The seats had a side button where you can either stay seated while watching the film, or stretch it out so its basically like watching a movie while laying down, its freakin amazing, and so perfect for cuddling haha!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fistoflight

40,A Little Bit of Everything,"There is a little bit for everyone on CityWalk. Excellent restaurants, souvenir shops, shoe and clothing stores and an excellent movie theater.

Most attractions had a 50 minute wait, but with our passes, we were able walk right up to the front of the line and get right on the attractions with almost no delay. Although the Front of the Line pass only allows you access one time to bump to the front of the line, it was still worth it. The Water World show was awesome.

40,Fun entrance of Universal Studios,"For those that like to shop, there are plenty of fun choices, along with restaurants. Everything is very eye-catching.

30,"Very, very expensive for what you get",My family and I live near CityWalk so we get free parking passes making going there feasible in terms of money. We usually only go there for the movies as we also have discount passes from Costco. If not for these discounts I can't imagine ever going here. The food is astoundingly over-priced and the movies admissions prices make the restaurants seen reasonably priced! Almost $24.00/ticket for 3D or around $17.00 for a regular ticket? Other than tourists whose money seems easy to take it's not worth a visit unless you happen to be there after touring the Studio lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark

20,Too Expensive!!,When this first opened we used to love to visit. Go to a movie and then eat. No more!! Parking is outrageous and the crowds are horrible. Food is really not good. Even the chain restaurants are better elsewhere. Don't waste your money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/collector
50,"With-It Vibes, Bunches of Boutiques, Easy to Park","I was in LA when they opened CityWalk..off the 101 and Barham Boulevard. From the first, it was easy to get to, easy to park in, and hard to leave. The restaurants are theme-based and fine, the boutiques are varied and plentiful (from Native American jewelry and figures to skateboard, beach, and travel wear), and the theatres are ell-appointed. The week-end crowd can be boisterous...but this is L.A., baby! The experience of just walking around the theme park-like atmosphere is as good as it gets...music, bustle, laughter, multicultural immersion...and did I say exciting? Well, it is. Go there...go Wednesday night...go Saturday night...whole different vibe. I went there often and do when I visit. Oh, and if you are stuck on the 101 at Studio City, go to the CityWalk, pay the fee, and drive away past the dreaded Barham clog! Worth the cash if you have to be on the other side of the hills quickly. this is MY secret...and I give it to you at TripAdvisor!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/429julieannep
40,City Walk edges out its Orlando twin,"As we were short of time decided to call at City Walk. Here, there is a plethera of shops to stretch anyones wallet and the full range of eateries from fast foods such as Pinks through to restaurants such as Tony Romas, something for everyone.

40,Great shops and must try Voodoo doughnuts!,There are a ton of restaurants and shops at CityWalk. A great place for buying gifts. We also went to the cinema here - the tickets were surprisingly cheap. As we only went to CityWalk for the shops and cinema (we did not visit the park) the parking was reduced to $5 (via a refund from the cinema) which is a good deal. The Universal shop was great as we manged to buy lots of Harry Potter gifts without visiting the park. I was also surprised to find a Voodoo Doughnuts - an absolute must! Best doughnuts we have ever tasted!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieDewing

50,Fun Place,"This place is a shopping and food place. It is right next door to the theme park, but you don't have to go into the park to get park merchandise.

30,Outdoor Mall,"It's a fine outdoor mall, always clean, lots of shops, a large number of dining options, movie theater, but nothing too compelling from any other outdoor mall.

Easy one stop ride on subway to Universal metro station then a free shuttle up to Universal. Was cool just to wander around at night, walk through shops, look at the glittering signage, check out the kids running through the trick fountain and get a bite to eat. Lots of chain style eats to pick from. We went to the Chinese restaurant there. Great atmosphere. Later on our trip we went to the Orlando Walk which is bigger and more options but this was great for a night activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markgM7625IR
30,Outdoor Mall and PAY for parking,This is nothing more then a outdoor mall/eatery. It also has a movie theater and that's about it. The prices are the same as in a mall. Nothing great to drive out of your way for plus you have to pay for parking. It was costly just to walk around cheaper to go to a local mall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
40,Entertainment Hotspot,If you love to try restaurants of any different type then this is your spot. Pricewise it is a little high due to the popularity but still a worthy experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johndY2387BU
40,Nice walk-through on your way to Universal Studios.,"We didn't spend a lot of time here, but you do have to walk through to get into the park. There are lots of restaurants and shops to explore if that is something you enjoy. We just wanted to get to the park, but there are lots of things to catch the eyes of little ones. It sure was set up in a way to get everyone in our group excited to start their day of fun!BTW: Parking wasn't too bad for us, but we were there about an hour before the park opened. Make sure you take a photo of the section you parked in before you leave your vehicle. The lots were packed when we came out.

It's aside Universal Studios. It's packed with small shops, arcades, and restaurants. Pop music blares. It's just a relatively fun colorful place to hang out a bit.Don't drive there from your hotel and pay the expensive parking, take the metro subway. The Metro Red Line Universal City subway stop is directly across the street from CityWalk. There's a free shuttle that will take you up and down the hill. You can catch it at the bottom of the hill by the tall black NBC Universal building.Incidentally, Studio City, on the subway stop side of the street, is clean and pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKenealy

40,Best food value,Universal Studios is a must see attraction in southern california but food in the park is expensive. We stop here to grab a better deal on food. Fast food and chain restaurants. This trip ww had a doughnut for breakfast snd smashed burger for supper. We had drinks at the hard rock cafe and bubba gumps. Fate of the furious opened that day and they had cars from the show on display in front of the theatre. We found that locals came to the mall for movies and food and shopping. We even saw people going to grad. Its a good mix of tourists and locals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevinlA5161PL

The selection of restaurants here will have any person scratching their head with the choices available.

50,A great experience!,"This place it's just incredible!! You can see some of the places where your favorite movies from Hollywood have been taken! Some ones like Harry Potter, Bruce Dios todo poderoso, and a lot more, for shure you have to take the train trip, so you can have a better knowledge and incredible experience!You can go along, but definitely it's better go with some one else!

40,Cool place,We come to visit Universal City Walk it was nice experience .The restourants is little bit over priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodtravelandfunking
50,Universal is constantly rennovating,"I've seen City Walk evolve since the 90s and it just keeps on getting better. There are food choices and novelty items for every taste and budget. Each time we visit USH we stop in to for either lunch or dinner. Glad the parking has increased too. Even on the biggest attendance record of the year (Jan. 1 or 2) parking was simple to get. The only thing is, we end up spending quite a bit. Citywalk was designed well and does it's purpose... keep customers coming back for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CHinSoCal
50,"Bright Lights, Big CityWalk","This is a fun place to go after visiting Universal Studios. I guess it was supposed to close the same time but it was a soft close and restaurants stay open an hour or so later. (We've visited in the summer before and it was open later.) In addition to restaurants there are lots of shops, a theater, and a sort of water fountain play area.There are two levels to CityWalk and some digital billboards span both levels. It reminds me of Times Square or big cities in Asia like Tokyo, Seoul, etc. Very lively. It's a great area to walk around and soak up a big city vibe.It's free to visit but parking is not free. Unlike Downtown Disney in Anaheim (see that review) you don't have to enter through security.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wannabefolkie
50,Nice place to walk,Enjoyed walking in that area. Very nice view. It is beautiful at night. We left in the evening and it was beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saitan

50,Razzle Dazzle of Lights and Sounds!,"Wow! That's the word that comes immediately to mind as you walk along this technicolour display. There's every shop you can think of, plus mouth-watering aromas from a wealth of different eateries. At night, thousands of enormous neon signs blaze and blink into life – and you have to say 'wow!' all over again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DV226
50,Love it!,So many cool shops and eateries! We had to keep reminding our group that City Walk was open long after the park closes. We got a few souvenirs and grabbed dinner on our way out of the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/602sabraw
50,Stroll the walk,"Great location, so many stores, restaurants and theater. Extra is filmed her Monday-Friday, fun to watch. There's an indoor skydiving type adventure. Tons of food to choose from. Come eat shop walk and enjoy. Valet parking can get pricey so self park, it's more reasonable. Camachos cantina has fabulous Mexican food, and perfect Cadillac margaritas! Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JodiW939
50,Restaurants and shops of all descriptions,"Very easily accessible, with a shuttle bus going from the Universal subway station, Universal Citywalk is fantastic. I went there 3 times during my stay and every day found something new and different. Every type of food you can think of and also lots of great shops to choose from. The atmosphere is also really great and there's plenty of music shows etc going on. There's also a huge cinema right in the middle of Citywalk, if you're looking for something to do in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulawDublin

40,Fun Shopping Venues After a Day at Universal Studios,"Similar to Orlando, Universal CityWalk Hollywood has a wide array of shopping, dining and entertainment options. Your ticket to Universal gives you a discount at the Cinemax (which at $18/adult definitely needs one!). If you like Voodoo doughnuts (be sure to look for that one in the rotating display case by the cash register) then go early to avoid the more lines later in the day. We enjoyed shopping in the socks store, but didn't eat anywhere on site, despite the wide array of (mostly chain) choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indy_working_mom
50,"so many stores, so little time","I enjoyed just ""people watching"". So many stores, options, food but oh look a RAIDERS STORE!!!! Spent most of our time there lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawglovr
30,Good but not entirely unique,Lots of shops you can find across southern california but the dining is convenient when you're visiting the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HiRoShimmy
50,great place to visit,"Every time I'm in Hollywood I have to eat here. lots to do, great place to people watch. I have seen numerous celebrities here. Parking isn't cheap and their shady security enjoys harassing teenagers who aren't with their parents. Other than that a great place to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chriskK4434CP
30,run through the water,"like any other visitor attraction - lots of fake buildings, but it does have a nice Hollywood feel.nice italian restaurant all the way at the back. There is a random waterfall display and its fun to see if you can walk across it and predict the pattern without getting soaking wet.GOOD for FAMILIES and Teens",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shaunx10
40,"Good shops, including LUSH, good movie theater, good restaurants","I usually come up myself to shop at LUSH. I come here with visitors to do the toursity thing - like to grab a Jamba Juice on way to Universal Studios, then dinner at Hard Rock Cafe for dinner, or do dinner and a movie; parking is expensive and annoying and a fair trek away from everything....my main peeve about City Walk...i always think that if i'm spending money on movies/shopping/dining then parking should not be $18 - that's the cheapest!!! More expensive ? $25 for preferred and more again for valet!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806
20,"Not my idea of a vacation activity, but teens would like it","Lots of shops, and chain restaurants, geared towards families, and teenagers. A bombardment of the senses, noise, crowds, over the top kitch architecture. This ""attraction"" exists mainly to separate people from their money with nothing in return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jennydonut
50,Pleasant Atmosphere,"Universal City Walk in Hollywood is a nice place to take a walk by yourself or with family and friends. The atmosphere is very relaxing and on hot days there is a spot for playing in a water feature (like the kind of sprinklers we all wanted as kids:) Shop, eat, get coffee. It's a nice place to spend a couple of hours of free time (or more)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tovad111
30,"Eat, Watch and Shop","There are definitely a lot of eating choices if you don't want to eat inside the park, or, like us, you were staying close by at the hotels and want to pop by for a meal. We ate at the Hard Rock, the food court upstairs (Panda Express and Smash Burger), Jamba Juice, Ben and Jerry's, Cinnabon, Voodoo Doughnuts, Sparky's and Dongpo Kitchen. Most of the Walk doesn't actually open until 11 am, even though the park was open at 9 am. There is shopping- stuff from the park and also some Disney stuff too as well as hip clothing stores like Billabong and Hop Topic or kitschy shops with a little bit of everything like Francesca. There is also a Sketchers store and a Lids. If you wanted a catch a movie, there is an AMC theatre but I can't comment on it as we didn't use it. Everything is closer together here than Downtown Disney and so feels more outdoor mallish rather than walking blocks and blocks to explore. My daughter and I meandered through, including grabbing lunch to take back to the hotel, and were done in just over two hours. There was lots we weren't interested in looking at but I can definitely see the demographic that it is geared at- teenager to twenty-somethings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/temby77
50,Beautiful,Wish we had more time and energy to explore CityWalk. It was really pretty with flowers and bright lights. We were exhausted after our day at the park though and wanted to get back to the hotel to rest. Hope to go back to explore it more thoroughly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pokee
50,Great for all ages,"Experienced what CityWalk had to offer after dropping the kids off at Universal. It has an assortment of shopping, dining, movie theater, nightlife and a great water feature for all ages to enjoy and cool off in the hot California sun. You can easily spend a few hours here exploring the shops, enjoying a coffee or drink, sampling the many different food options and even enjoy a good movie. If you are going to Universal you need to spend some time at CityWalk too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Busyworkingmom3

40,Mario Lopez We Are LOOOOKING for you!,"We were staying near the LA Airport, my daughters trip after college to do interviews and check out LA. This was last August 2016. We wanted to go to Hard Rock for dinner and enjoy the sights and sounds of Universal City without having to go on rides, etc...so we went to Universal CityWalk Hollywood. We took UBER (HINT: Take Uber Everywhere in LA) and although the map showed we were only 5-7 miles away the uber predictor said 45 minute drive - which was accurate. The drive is always interesting and has a lot to see and since it was dusk we got to see the city lights,.. We knew Mario Lopez did a show at the CityWalk but also knew they wouldn't be filming in the evening so we found the Hard Rock, had some excellent drinks and just 'so so' food and enjoyed an evening walk around CityWalk after our meal. Nice energy and we felt safe in the area. We ubered home and watched Match Game w/ Alec Baldwin, who always makes us laugh. Fun Night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814reneec

40,Great for after park entertainment,We shopped and had dinner here after a day at the park. The sock store is neat and lots if food choices. Great that they have a universal store incase you forget to get something in the park. Not sure I would come here if we were not going to the park since parking costs are crazy high.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erawson77
40,This place rocks if you are going to the park!,"I recommend City Walk to those either going into the theme park, those who have reservations at a City Walk restaurant, or those going to the movie theatre on the premises. Nice fountain diplay in the middle but not much to see on its own at CityWalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnV541

50,"Love it, but caution if its busy!","I have visited Universal 4 times now, and never disappoints. This year however was the busiest I have ever experienced. The inclement weather that was hitting LA at the time did not seem to dispel the visitors. It was incredibly, almost suffocatingly busy, and it was hard to keep track of everyone you are with. Shops were popular, but you really have to shop around to avoid the overpriced tourist traps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543grayp
30,Lots of average restaurants,"The biggest draw for me was all the neon lights after dark.None of the restaurants are worth the trip. But if you're in the area, they are convenient.Got some good caramel corn.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tour224332

40,A fun cool place to go,"A very interesting shopping, eating area that has great visuals. A must to walk around and see the sights. Has the Hollywood flair at its finest. Many shops and restaurants to stop and check out. A major tourist area with people watching added in. The nice thing is you can go there and check it out without paying to go into the park. Worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353

50,The human zoo,"People watching is always interesting at CityWalk. Especially when it's cold and rainy and windy and you have kids playing in the fountains, soaking wet....quite entertaining!

Had the intention to go to a movie but decided against after seeing the prices of the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nalalita
40,Great area!,"We walked over from our hotel (The Hilton) to Universal CityWalk just to get some exercise, get out of the hotel and see if there were any restaurants we were interested in.

50,Something for Everyone,"CityWalk offers specialty shops, restaurants, coffee shop, night clubs, and more. Whether you are here with kids or as a couple, there's more than enough ways to enjoy the evening. Lots of lights, people, and entertainment. It also provides a great place to eat just outside the park...better food options in a sit-down restaurant atmosphere for a fair price ($75 at CityWalk will be a much nicer meal than in the park). It could be a great date night venue apart from the park too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chapsw

50,Grinchmas 2016,"My family of 9 visited on a Friday and had so much. There was something for everyone and not too expensive for such a big group. The Hogwarts experience was amazing. Frozen butter beer is a must and big donuts if your into sweets! Got to meet the grinch and take our family picture. The employees are all in full character. We got to see a few shows, were able to do all the rides and no big lines like at other parks. We had little ones and teens so we really like the child switch choices. We were able to take turns and the kids waiting rooms were very nice. Very kid friendly and stroller friendly. We were skeptical about going with so many little ones but universal made it so easy that we are definitely coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylizrenteria

We were there in December so there was plenty of performances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciaf6
50,All in one!,"The Universal City Walk is one of the best touristic places to visit in LA. It is a sort of Open Mall or Villa with dozens of options to eat and buy souvenirs. It is located right next to the Universal Studios Theme Park, so it shares with it plenty of parking spots and stays open all day long and a good part of the night. Perfect place to hang out with friends and family. Safe, clean and organized, although very crowded at some times, specially on weekends.Another good thing is that it is accessible through the metro red line if you prefer to leave the car home. It is just one station away from the Hollywood and Highland at the Hollywood Blvd.The place also holds the best movie theater in town. Better even than the famous and traditional Chinese Theater.The general costs around, as expected for such a touristic venue, are not the cheapest, but it is worthy for the general experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaphaelBB
50,Great atmosphere,After a day in the park this area was great to eat and shop. Plenty of entertainment and activities or the kids. What a great place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KellyB991
30,A Crowd. It's Loud.,"I live close to this and therefore, the CityWalk is part of our lives on a regular basis. I suppose it's fine as a one time thing. A tourist attraction. Parking is a nightmare and expensive. The AMC theater has been remodeled and it's awesome. But expensive. The rest of the place is mostly chain restaurants and odd stores. There is piped in music EVERYWHERE. I'd say if you have to pick an ""area"" to visit and shop... go to the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newtzlaw
50,Don't Miss It!,"Our day at City Walk was extremely pleasant. Crowds are handled beautifully with the layout of the shops, cinema, and restaurants. From restaurant wait staff to security staff, everyone there was more than willing to help us have a top-notch experience. We're looking forward to visiting again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ConnieML

50,Extended Vacation Last Day before headed East,"Skipping out of the park to explore places to eat is easy, convenient, and fulfilling. We waited until after sunset as the lights, sights and sounds were magnified and spectacular. One doesn't require a pass here as it is entirely open to anyone.We enjoyed our time, got a great meal, and headed back into the park afterward to enjoy less wait time for our last ride on Harry Potter.Peace, Matt😎",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattR154
40,Quick trip to City Walk,"My friend took me to CityWalk before I had to leave my vacation. I hadn't been to Universal Studios since I was a little kid and now in my mid-30s, I have to say it has changed. City walk was rather a nice time to visit and the stores were great.

40,"Vibrant, energetic, and dynamic atmosphere","We visited the Universal CityWalk on a Saturday night. It was a short drive from Loews Hollywood Hotel (less than 10 minutes). We were able to find parking ($20) nearby and take an elevator to the entrance.The CityWalk is a free, open-air attraction next to Universal Studios. It is very vibrant and energetic! The streets are lined with a selection of shops and restaurants. You can go indoor skydiving, ride a mechanical bull, or check out the music venues.We worked up an appetite from all the shopping so we ate at Tony Roma's Steakhouse. I recommend to make your reservations when you first arrive.Hopefully, the next time we visit we will have more time so we can visit Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep_girl_00
40,Great place to enjoy an anniversary date ~,"My husband and I decided to spend our 42nd anniversary at Universal City walk. There are plenty of shops for shopping for grandchildren. Plenty of places to eat, and this is a great place to sightsee and people watch. I will return ~",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A_V_Wedding_Lady
40,Eating and shopping,"This was a bit unimpressive. However, we walked out if the park and were able to get into a restaurant and eat dinner. We were also able to do some shopping done that we didn't get to at the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZCityGirl

40,Time away from the park,"Even though it's busy, it's a good place to eat, drink and shop away from the hustle of the park; there's even a cinema to catch the latest movies.There is also an outdoor stage, and when we visited it was host to a children dance troupe competition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888ar1
30,City Walk free - pay parking,"If you are looking for something to do but don't want to spend $$ to get into the park you can still visit Universal on the City Walk. Only pay for parking. Be sure to go in the evening because there's lots of entertainment along the way. Restaurants from Pink's Hot Dogs and Subway to Bubba Gumps and Hard Rock Cafe. Snacks, coffee, candy. Shopping too. On a hot day let the kids play in the sidewalk fountains. There is a movie theatre there too. Stroll and people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/297PaulaL
40,Just chilling,"Really nice place to visit with family and friends all year long, even if you're a local visitor or a out of state tourist on vacation you won't be disappointed with a variety of good restaurants and shops. If visiting with children your best bet is to visit early during the day before it gets to crowded with teenagers at night. Hope you have a great time as my family and I did last summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josepQ2296GL
50,Wonderful visit!,"Sundays on Citywalk is very nice! My son and I walked around, had Blaze Pizza. Checked the toy store out. Definitely Pokemon Go friendly! Lots of Poke Stops and tons of Pokemon. Will come back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3901OSlisac

50,Shopping and Food,"My family and I always stop here after a long day at Universal Studios. So many stores here. Candy, comics, restaurants and live entertainment. Hollywood souvenirs and much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/13bethaniea
50,FIRST TIME THERE,"Universal CityWalk is a plaza full of restaurants and retail stores. Their website lists all the eating and shopping options. Karl Strauss Brewing Co. was our choice for dinner. It is on the 2nd level and we ate on the balcony. Our party of 3 tried the Mediterranean salad, Tabouli and Melon salad, and the Avocado Turkey Burger. All were very good. The highlight of the night was the large bag ($8) of ""Cinnamon Toast"" (aka Churro flavor) popcorn at Popcornopolis!! It was warm and delicious!!! They have free samples, too! Parking was $10 per car. There is a parking garage at the bottom of the hill but I suggest you drive up to the top. We saw lots of people walking up and down the hill to their cars when there was plenty of parking up top near the entrance. Fun place to go for those new to LA!! And there are dancing water spouts that kids (and adults) can run through!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PKW000
40,A quick stop over,"My brother-in-law came to visit from the PI. It's a must for us to drop by here, one of the great spots to be for tourists.Great frames for pictures for souvenir, Food is everywhere. Close to other spots you might want to visit. Or if you have some spare bucks, go for the rides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bornok_30
30,No impressed,"it was very quiet when we went, even on the labour day weekend. There was not a lot of variety and not a lot to do. I left feeling underwhelmed.. took all of 15minutes to walk around and even if you went into every shop.. it would take much longer.. I thought the Disneywalk was much better...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/546AngelaP
50,Great Area,This is a great area to visit whether you are going to universal studios or not. There is a great variety of eating places and shops to enjoy. I would recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebelgirls
40,A hit with teens,"Fun, lively atmosphere. Beware- of restaurant wait times which always take longer than stated if you have a shuttle to catch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ally464
40,Great Experience,"If you go to LA, you should definitely find your way to this place. You can experience universal studios without having to actually attend the universal studios park. Of course you have to pay to park in their garage but it was inexpensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdoug19
50,Dinner at City Walk,"California food never seems to disappoint and this dinner was really great. We chose Karl Strauss Brewery for our evening. Service was great, beers were amazing and the food was just over the top. We relied on our servers recommendations and he (Sam) was spot on. Fresh ingredients, perfect seasonings and ample portions were the order of the day. Please try this wonderful restaurant if you have the chance!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McKees5

40,Anti-Climax After Universal Studios,"Worth checking out if you're coming to Universal Studios in any case, but be warned that most outlets are quite pricey. There are some interesting street activities like bathing fountains for kids and the indoor sky-ride. Good news is that one can walk around for an hour or so, and get a good feel of it without spending a penny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anon00001
50,Always something interesting.,"I get to Universal CityWalk about one time year, and there always seems to be something interesting, or something exciting just around the corner. Loaded with shops and restaurants, Broadcast boots, and plenty and plenty of people it always seems to be hopping. CityWalk isn't that big, so it won't take you long to cover the place… But for a destination outside the gates of universal, this is a fun place to start your day or end in your day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhavekost
20,Vacation,Pushy salespersons. Not impressed. Overpriced food and products. Didn't spend much time here as it was a waste of time and money. Too bad though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/599kristinh
40,Love it!,Loved the place.The city walk was better than universal studios😜..great place to enjoy good music and fast food!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549sanaz
50,From Harry Potter to souvenirs,"At the Universal City walk you can find something to eat or a Gryffindor cap,you can spend hours walking up and down the City walk there is all kinds of food and stores. The only ""bad"" thing about the walk is there is a risk you don't make to the Universal studios entrance if you are here for a studio visit :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindgaard2016
40,Fun place to visit,We arrived at our hotel after a VERY long ride from San Diego and took a free shuttle to City Walk. We had fun walking around and we ate dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe. The music and dancing were a lot of fun - our teenage daughter had a blast dancing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nmrchick
40,Tip to get parking for just $5,"City Walk offers something for everyone at a price of course. The shopping area lines your entrance to Universal Studios and is a great place to hang out after the park. AMC Offers the latest movie offerings including IMAX in comfortable seats. The area is being renovated but most of the services, shops and restaurants are not affected. AMC also offers a $12 rebate on parking if you go see a movie after visiting Universal Studios so you only end up paying $5 for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NauticalVoyager
50,So much to do!,The city walk is absolutely amazing! There are so many shops and places to eat in this area walking up to universal studios! We will come back to check out the night scene as well when we don't have the kiddos with us!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danb267

30,Good after Universal studios,It's an ok visit after the park when you are pretty exhausted to go anywhere else but yet you still want dinner. The food options are pretty limited and the stores are not great at all. But it keeps you entertained for a little bit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212alexiss
50,A full evening of entertainment,This place took us by surprise. We had booked the Hard Rock Cafe for 7 but were not expecting to still be looking around here after 10.The whole place looks very vibrant and impressive. It's a hub of great stores and restaurants among neon lights and scenery. We stood and watched a guitaist while also watching a little fountain show for a good long while. We went into all the fun candy stores and tourist shops which was a lot of fun. Who knew a shop selling just socks could be so extensive?If you're planning a meal here make sure you spare a few hours to see some of the stores and entertainment here. You'll be glad you did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/156ChrisM
50,First time,"This is the first time that we have made it here. We loved the place especially because of the Oakland Raider store. It's hard to find a good NFL store living in Colorado. Lots of other shops and restaurants. The crowds weren't too crazy either. Parking was very close, walking distance, and was easy to remember which garage you parked in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzo10943
50,Shopping,"I love city walk, great prices, great restaurants. Lot of things to do and a great entertaining place. I would defenetly go back. I enjoy harry potter store I'm a big fan and I enjoy a smaller shop that had a variety of souvenirs a great price. The parking it's $18 so it's expensive but if you are going to be more than 3 hours it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julioc549
40,Cool looking,Pretty impressive and funny place with all the huge signs and props. The shops and restaurants are basic chain places though. Pretty large place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Katyakatya111
30,Something you want to see,Something you want to see if you like movies but a few ours are enough. It is fun to find your favorite actors star. There are some really good resturants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/938mikaelj
50,Good and crowded,"City walk, if you have been to the one in Orlando, you won't be disappointed, it's pretty similar although a bit smaller, it has a fair amount of restaurants and shops where the prices are high as you could imagine. It is always crowded, people going to the park and others just having a walk out of Hollywood and near Harry Potter. A lot of fun and smiles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulaaB2116CW
50,Awesome place! Here's a parking tip...,"City Walk is a great place for taking your family out for an evening of fun, but it's also a perfect location for a romantic date with your special person.I took my wife and son this past Friday night around 7 pm and figuring it was the beginning of the weekend we expected a very crowded experience, especially as it's also the middle of summer. To our surprise it wasn't overcrowded at all! Yes there were a lot of people there and many were coming out of Universal Studios, but it was still not over the top. Even the restaurant we went to sat us right away with no waiting! City Walk offers over 30 restaurants to dine at, so you can take your pick according to whatever mood you happen to be in. We chose Buca di Beppo, my son's favorite.We also enjoyed the usual entertainment that City Walk is know for, including a live performance at the stage right near the entrance. I don't know who the singers were but they were good and lots of people stopped by to watch the show.Here's my parking tip:General parking is still $10 after all these years; forget the $20 special parking offer; it's not worth double the money. Just pay the general $10 fee and park near the elevators. You will be within a few feet of the entrance!Highly recommended place.- Cheers!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidfromLA
50,So Much To Do!,This was our last stop on our trip to Universal. There are a number of great restaurants and shops to enjoy while you enjoy the night life of Hollywood.The area is clean and always busy. There was a concert going on while we were there. Not sure who she was but she was very good and the crowd seemed to really enjoy it.We went in a couple shops and ate dinner at Bubba Gump while we were there. Fun place with lots of energy.Definitely a great way to end a trip to Universal Studios!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chris_Morales-Phan
40,Johnny Rockets and AMC theaters 19,"Johnny Rockets was very good, I ate there with my son. Good service and good food at a reasonable price. The atmosphere was enjoyable as well. Would definitely eat there again and recommend to others.AMC is under construction so a bit inconvenient right now. However once you are inside the theater, it is a clean and pleasant experience. Don't forget to get reimbursed for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813iamk
50,This is why you're visiting LA!,"A must see and a must do. Can be for several days. All the latest in Hollywood. Fantastic place if you have children, because they'll be bored with most of the things in Los Angeles that you might be interested in. Spend a few days here. And great for the night life and finding places to eat. Stay in the area or take METRO.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navigate00230422899

50,So much fun!,I almost enjoyed city walk more than the park haha. I loved this place I loved all the little shops. the show going on was fun to watch. There was lots of cool views here too. We ate at the Hard Rock and it was fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittanyWaters711
30,Not what I expected!,"I thought it would be more like the Grove with ALL types of stores, clothing, shoes, household goods. What was I thinking. What you will find are fast food restaurants, a couple of chain restaurants, and many tee shirts, key chain, magnets and candy stores. Shame on me. Now YOU KNOW what to expect.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag
40,Shops and food,"I took my 14 year old daughter there thinking it would be something really special, but its really just stores and food... We strolled around for 30 minutes and left.. If you like to shop and eat, then definitely go here! (It's safe and clean too).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dvatrdly

40,Fun area for food and shopping,"We stopped at the Wolfgang Puck before our Universal Park visit. We had a good, healthy lunch at a decent price. We didn't want to eat inside of the park. There are a bunch of other food options including a food court with a Subway and Smashburger. There are also a bunch of stores for shopping as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostfringie
40,Good selection of restaurants,"Good selection of restaurants, 20 minute wait for table for dinner is normal, no waiting and a lot quieter for lunch. Lots of retail associated with universal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffg564
30,"Not bad, free!, but mostly a place for food and shopping for Universal Studios goodies","So this is a free area outside the Universal Studios themepark. it is all high quality appearance and presentation, like the park - but there aren't the rides, etc. What it is is a place to get food and to do some shopping if you didn't go in the park for your souvenirs, or forgot to get some. I believe all the same items are available in the CityWalk Universal store. There are a lot of places to eat, from sit down to fast food. And one part that was quite fun is a central plaza that in the late afternoon/evening has a DJ with music and commentary engaging the crowd to have fun, dance, some contests, etc. CityWalk is a good way to pass a couple hours, but overall just an average stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougmendoza
40,Night Life is Wonderful!,"City Walk is very lively at night! Lots of different stores, restaurants, and friendly people. Live music available right in the heart of the city, with people dancing in the streets. Awesome light displays available, as well as plenty of eateries. Would definitely recommend. Traveling tip - I would recommend the VIP parking VS regular. It is a few $$ extra, however the convenience of having my car on the same deck as City Walk was worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrystalB0312
40,Great spot for the kids,Fun location with several decent eating choices from sit-down to food court. Can pick up a meal or a snack. We watched a movie in the theater and enjoyed sitting in the balcony. Kids liked watching the dancing fountains the most. Easy walk from the Hilton but keep in mind the walk from the Hilton is not stroller friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iroamaround67801
50,Lots of shopping and good treats,Very nice place to visit if your not going to the park and want to shop and eat some treats. Great places to visit but just like any travel check some reviews before you eat (on trip advisor of course).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyf925
50,Lots of Eye Candy,"Parking was $18 so be prepared. Good design and lots of retail and dining, fun and entertaining. Wish I had more money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraf330
20,$18 Parking ??? Just to shop and eat!!!,"What a joke that Universal City Walk wants you to pay to shop and eat in their already inflated priced establishments. I don't mind paying a few dollars but $18 just so I can go and spend more money is ridiculous, plus they are so confused and disorganized (makes me question where all the money is going). Even Disney has a special lot for there entertainment complex where you can get free parking if you buy something. I will NOT come back here again until this stupid policy is changed. Shame on Universal for putting GREED in front of common sense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch

40,Santa and Tinashe,I've been visiting Citywalk since I was a teenager so it's fun to hang out here with my own kids. we visited in December for my sons birthday weekend and we were also delighted that there was a free holiday performance by Tinashe. my son loves her. the area wasn't too crowded thankfully so we were able to browse and shop around before the performance. the Citywalk always stays up to date with the best restaurants and shops and the crowd is both local and touristy. I'm sure we'll be back yearly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dexter619
40,Restaurants and shops,"There are a lot of good restaurants with ""normal"" pricing. If you're getting hungry in the park, you're better to wait and eat here. And don't stop just outside the gate...go down the entire CityWalk to find better value and more choices. We found Tony Romas with immediate seating, quick service and great good. When you see the dancing waters, you're in the center where most restaurants are located.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,Tons of Souvenirs,"Before we went to Universal Studios, we took a glance of a souvenir shop where they sell all kinds of socks and we pretty much like to shop in it because what you cannot on any department store are souvenir socks. Then after we finished visiting Universal Studios, we went shopping again in the Universal City Walk and we found a place where they sell some artifacts and we bought some especially refrigerator magnets or metal cabinet magnets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pelando

There are so many great restaurants, candy shops, ice cream stores, donut treats, etc. We were overwhelmed with all of the bright colors and the beautiful decor. There is so much to do here. My family and I (two kids ages 7and 11) just loved this place. You can really spend an entire day just walking, shopping and eating here. We spent one day here and our second day at the adjacent Universal Studios. I highly recommend visiting this great location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debrap49

30,Car parking expensive,"Yesterday afternoon my partner suggested city walk, yeah great idea i said, we have done this in florida and expected the same experience.$18 to park your car (were not staying the night)A few shops and some resturants.The $18 dollars would not of been that bad had we been going in universal theme park and then city walk but we only wanted to waste a couple of hours in city walk.However we did manage to redeem parking by going to the cinema and getting $13 dollars of the cinema tickets making the parking $5 dollars in total which was not so had to accept after that.We did not have the intention of seeing a film but it justified the parking we saw The Huntsman which we enjoyed.We did not check trip adviser before going to citywalk as it was a spontaneous decision and we did not have internet on our mobiles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/perkanater

50,Must visit if you want view a part of what Los Angeles is...,"Hello Tigereyes... Not sure if you already made your visit to California, but to answer your question, Universal CityWalk is free with no tickets needed, just need to pay for parking as if you are going to visit Universal Studios. Think of it as a outdoor shopping mall that is right next to Universal Studios. It is a great place to visit on one of those days that you don't want to get too exhausted and grab a nice dinner or lunch. There is vast variety of fast food & restaurants for everyone's budget. Great place for families or couples.There is a movie theater there that includes a large IMAX screen if you want to slow things down during your visit (if you catch a movie, you will receive a rebate for parking, and your parking will only be $5). I recommend dinning at the Hard Rock Cafe, always live, food & drinks always great! Lot of small shops with unique items, or to get souvenirs Have fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ben1900
50,Good way to pass an evening,Staying at the nearby Hilton we made use of the complimentary shuttle to get over to CityWalk most nights of our stay.

30,"Fun to look around for a bit, shops and fast food mostly...","Quite a fun place to have a look around, but nothing particularly special. Usual shops and the food court was pretty much standard for its type. There are sit-down places to eat too. Spotlessly clean. The toilets are a bit hidden out of the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Merrowmum
40,Seeing the lights,"Came to Universal CityWalk in the evening, for some dinner and walking around. I took the free transfer between the RedLine stop and CityWalk. The place was bustling with people (not overly), and lots of bright lights and displays. Enjoyable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ice_D_8
50,Super fun place any day/time of the week.,We didn't have time to visit Universal Studios so we stopped at Universal CityWalk. Parking was a bit far and expensive but plenty of spaces. the CityWalk appears larger than it actually is because it is behind the Studio Tour. There are many restaurants and shops. My relatives visiting from Sweden were very impressed and would like to return some day to tour the studio.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bunny0016
50,Entertainment sorted for the evenings,"Me and my teenage sons went here a couple of times in the evenings to watch movies and to eat. Also done a bit of browsing too.The whole city walk is very bright with neon lights and is very much aimed at fun.If you can imagine a mini Vegas style strip, lots of eateries, cinema bars and shops. All very tacky but I love that. This is not the place to come to if you want to chill or have a quiet meal.All the shops and restaurants are you're run of the mill fast food joints but you have a large choice of which ones to choose..It's my type of place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianbY752PL

10,No Thanks,"Um, no. Insanely crowded and not at alllll worth it. Boring restaurants. Boring and common shops. I have no idea what the big deal is. Skip it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KamranNezami
20,This place is dying,"Just visited this place today to watch a movie with the kids (Sunday morning), saw several stores that was boarded, not many attraction to keep ""locals"" guest coming back, nothing to be excited about after a year of last visit. So so.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrponciano
50,Chill & walk-Night or day!,"Visited the Hollywood City Walk during a weekday. Not as crowded as i would imagine during the weekends. I found it to be a nice place to walk around, take pictures, eat, have a message, catch a movie.--> Do not pay for the closer parking lot UNLESSS YOU FIND YOURSELF EXTREMELY LAZY!! On the map they show you for the cheaper parking it looks extremely far from the Hollywood City Walk entrance, but honestly, it is NOT.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/przgrl13
40,Looks amazing at night,My third time of being here and I just love to look at all the scenery. I have eaten at various places here over the years but only managed to make it to Starbucks this year. There's a real variety of shops and it's a decent way to spend an evening looking around after a day at the theme park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AliP504
30,Should be more,The thing about this place is if you want to go just have lunch which is all I was trying to do you have to pay the $18 parking fee and there is no validation because you pay before you go in. It uses the same parking lot as the park. Makes things that much harder and more costly. Inside the shopping and the food was good. Your average franchise chains and many to choose from.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayanni8
50,Night at City Walk,"Last week, we went to Universal City Walk Orlando and we found it a good place to hang out.On my last night in Los Angeles, my friends decided to bring in Universal City Walk Hollywood.There were a lot of place and restos to hang out here and including Hard Rock Cafe.Great night and great seeing my friends here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesd66
20,Don't go on a weekday night,"I've been here several times before on weekends and the place is popping with shopping, clubbing, and eating. We came here on a Wednesday night and it was dead. Half of the stores were closed. The lighting was even poor for taking group photos. For my out of town friends it was a miss. If you can go on a weekend do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robbiolio

Brought me a nostalgic feeling.Everything was perfect.There are some stores... But you should chose a restaurant to dine and spend some more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElineLee

30,Probably better when not raining or in peak season,"On a rainy Tuesday afternoon I decided to visit Universal CityWalk, Hollywood.To say that it was quiet would be an understatement. Maybe there were 50 people, but I doubt it.Universal CityWalk is basically an open air food court with the usual food franchises, a couple of retail stores, and a movie theatre.I walked totally around it in about 10 minutes.The only other thing of interest is the iFly, which is a sort of wind tunnel where participants actually get blown into the air as though they are free falling and they can do tumbles and tricks. The three people that I saw - a little girl then two men - each appeared to enjoy it. It was the busiest out of all the stores.It probably is much busier when it is peak season and everyone from Universal Studios Theme Park come after a full day at the theme park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melbournian
30,Cool but nothing really stands out there,"Citywalk is like the mall and parking to Universal Studios Hollywood so there's everything that you would see at a mall but at slightly more touristy rates. but its cool there, look out for the mountain view and the view of the city at night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jiachaol
50,Must Be Done,"Easily missed, this needs to be put on the list and done! This venue lets you take the joy of your day at Universal to a place where you can eat, relax or shop. It helps you carry on what has already been a fantastic day and experience. Loved the vibe - great food options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquelo801
40,Fun Visit,"Definitely worth visiting the CityWalk if your visiting the studios as it is interesting to see. You could easily spend a lot of money here as plenty to do, see and eat but even just a walk through is worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whijo598
50,This place is so cool!,"First of all, this place i incredible well designed, just think about having your office in the middle of this place, wow, ok, it's location is great, the design is amazing, the places you can find here are first class, food, souvenirs, fun, and my next goal, try the iFly thing they have there, fully recommend it, if you are in LA, don't miss this place, you'll remember it forever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luiscanelo
40,So much to see a do,"This walk has really grown over the years, when we first went it was a couple dozen shops, now it is a massive complex with multiple parking garages. Easy to find off the 101 Freeway, some attractions like IFly validate the valet parking, so check before you go, the public parking is $18 for the day, no hourly options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248danj
40,Universal's answer to downtown Disney,"Pretty awesome place to hang out during or after Universal Studios Hollywood visit. Great alternative to theme park food. This area has lots of cool shops and great formal and informal restaurant. My wife and I loved veggie bowl (can't remember exact name) right next to taco bell, which is great healthy alternative to normal greasy fast food. It was quite cold when we visited but there were several heated seating areas that allowed us to enjoy the outdoors and our food at the same time without freezing our behinds.Would love to go there during fall or spring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shakeels2018
30,Not very unique,"We had time after visiting Universal Studios until our hotel bus picked up, so we walked around here. There was a lot of food options and we just had ice cream at Ben and Jerry's... but overall I didn't find the shops to be anything very unique or to have unique products. I was a little disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillshari
40,A fun tourists trap.,"We have visited the City Walk several times over the years, but this time we brought family with little ones along. It's always a fun visit.

Plus plenty of restaurants to please every type of taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/766donalds
30,Kitschy tourist trap,This is a great place to walk around and people watch if not too crowded. Be aware that what you'll find are a bunch of chain restaurants and snack shops and a variety of touristy shops where you can get everything from Dodgers gear to Universal Studios (over priced) t-shirts. Parking was a decent rate ($10 for general parking). Going at night seemed nicer due to all the neon and flashy lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chgo919
40,Shopping and Food,If you want trendy shopping and restaurants then head down here. Always something to see and do. Not a lot of public washrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/207timothyb

40,"Pretty Cool Spot, Some Nice Shops","Typical tourist trendy spot, a great addition to a day at the theme park.I should also note, the walk is not inside the park so you don't need to pay for a ticket to visit. It's also around the corner from the park entrance, sort of hidden.Expect to pay a little more for some stuff as it is a theme park city walk, but its worth the time spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocD77

40,Fun place and lots of restaurants to choose from,"I love the fun atmosphere at this place. There's lots of shops and restaurants. I've also seen people with their dogs walking around. Parking is expensive though at $18 (discounted from when I got my Universal Studios ticket). As a So Cal resident, this is not a place where I will go to regularly. As I said, the parking is expensive. But if I have guests from out-of-town, this is a good place to bring them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240mariaa

Yummy food!Found some awesome Christmas gifts at Hot Topic and Lids.If you are a fan of Star Wars, Harry Potter, Disney, Minecraft, Totoro, or Spirited Away then don't miss shopping at Hot Topic!There's a movie theatre, candy store, plenty of restaurants and other places to grab a quick bite.I did notice, however, that the Universal Studios store carries last merchandise than it did a year ago.I was a bit disappointed by this as I had hoped to find some fun Christmas gifts there but did not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lglbgl
40,Movie night,The location of AMC is great. Visiting Universal CityWalk really added to the movie night experience. Loved all the lights and shops and watching people trying the indoor sky diving.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Diamonds321
30,Nice vibe,"After universal we ate at the Mexican restaurant, not the greatest, tgey only had hot salsa and chips were like cardboard. Burrito was good, meat was tender and was not dry. Next we bought stuff at hot topic, which is a larger hot topic than most. Then bought stuff from the nerd comic store with iron man in their window. That was what we did there. Prices are typical mall prices, but its a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingW2341NS
20,Nothing special,"I went to City Walk after Universal park, and honestly there was nothing special. The shopping was expected tourist stores that exist everywhere, and food options were very underwhelming,Perhaps if there was an event I'd be more positive but the walk was a lonely boring place that I just wanted to leave.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamofvictoria
50,A must see,"Universal citywalk is a very good place to get out of the Southern Californian sun, apart from that the people who work there are so friendly, the shopping was good and there was good music which I enjoyed a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travmac75
50,Awesome!,"Such a fun place to visit. Great shopping, yummy food and great atmosphere. Everything you need really haha. Bonus is that it's open fairly late so you can enjoy everything without the sun beaming down on you, though there's plenty of shaded areas during the day and the shops are of course air conditioned. The selection of shops is pretty good and it would be fair to say that there's something for everyone here. Very cool!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzsusanc

10,Terrible,City walk in Cali is just awful it's about 50 ft long and all 50 ft suck. There are terrible restaurants and then the world famous wolf gang puck should be wolf gang yuck it's just awful.

50,Walk of Fame.,"The excitement, glitz, drama, and characters that are on this street, it fantastic. There is so much to see here, just make sure and wear your sunblock, as the sun can be blazing hot during the daytime. The street characters are also out and about in the night. You can spend the entire day here just perusing the stars to find your favourite movie star or looking out at the Hollywood sign on the hill, or outside the Dolby theatre scanning the walls for the names of all the movies that won best movie.Don't forget to charge your camera/phone, and have plenty space for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pennilicious

50,Times Square atmosphere in a different time,"Attached to Universal Studios but free to enter , this is a welcome haven from all the queues and rides .

40,Good place for food and shopping with a nice early evening atmosphere,"The open access area of Universal Studios with shops, restaurants, live music and entertainment on that’s suitable for all ages.

30,Great for groups or a date.,City Walk is ok for large groups. The dining options are plenty. Be prepared on busy weekends as the wait at the restaurants is a bit of a waite. The IMAX is kinda small for what I seen before. Remember where you park as it can get confusing after leaving the venue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HolidayInnHollywood
30,Boring,"Notice that a major part of the positive reviews here are for Universal Studios, which are awesome, and NOT the Citywalk, which is basically an outside mall with pretty much ordinary shops.You'll begin your day in the Studios with the CityWalk, which leads to the Studios from the general parking lot. Take pictures of King Kong and other Universal Studios icons, shop in IT'SUGAR for your favourite merchandise, and then head straight to the Studios, there isn't much to see here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GameServer
50,Universal and city walk,What a great day. Give yourself at least 12 hrs! Eat up at city walk since it's cheaper. The mummy and jurrassic park ride are the best. Tried singles to get through lines,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathycN8501IC

40,Met family for an interactive time,"We planned to do Universal Studios but found the lines were close to a three hour wait, so we goofed around on the Citywalk.Lots of fun stores. It seems like each store has its own personality, and they are all over the top in terms of decor on the outside of their buildings.Once the live DJ started and the cameraman started scanning the crowd and posting the crowd on the big screen, our 15 year old and his cousins became pretty animated.Fun for a short period of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/just1beth
30,Basically an outdoor mall,We had several people tell us it's a must see and it's free . But realistically is an over crowded outside mall with a $10 parking fee. The only thing different from a mall is that it's outside Universal And it had an Universal Studio store .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickp689

30,Have Funand atch the Kiddies,"We have been there 3 times over the last 5 years. It is fun and very upbeat. Pretty loud. There are a lot of places to eat, from food stands to full, sit-down restaurants. The last time we were there we chose what seemed to be an upscale Mexican restaurant, and it was nt good, but the menu looked like it would be. There are a lot of shops , music, vendor carts, etc. It is always fun and lively, but the crowd changes after dark and it is not somewhere I would go with young children after about 7:00pm. It becomes a lot rowdier and the song lyrics more adult. Overall, we have had a fun time there, but I prefer Downtown Disney, by far.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Miztude
40,Great for the Family and Teenagers,"Great visit with Teenagers and Younger Children. Lots of fun stuff to do with eating and shopping available. This is a ""scene"" on Friday and Saturday evenings with lots of Teenagers hanging out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB

10,Movies at Universal. Never again.,"I made the mistake of going to Universal CityWalk to see a movie yesterday. I had not been there in years. Now I remember why. From the moment we drove onto the property things started to go badly. To start with the parking lot is like a maze from hell, or maybe I should say to hell. It costs an outrageous $10 to park, they will refund you $5 if you're going to the movies which makes it a little better but you have to head to the ticket stand to get your refund. Once we finally found a spot to park the it was like a search for the holy grail to find a way out of the lot. The journey went from one level of hell to the next. Once out of the lot we followed a dim trail of signs towards the theaters, we were finally lead to a square that might have been designed as an homage to Shibuya but looks more like a neon nightmare. We picked up our tickets and $5 refund for the parking, entered the theater and took our comfortable seats about 12 minutes before the movie was supposed to begin. There were commercials playing when we walked in, and they did not stop. And they got louder and louder and louder and LOUDER! Until it was almost unbearable. It literally hurt my ears it was so loud, then the previews began. And they went on, and on, and on, and on, and on. There were at least 25 minutes of previews interspersed with intensely obnoxious animated short instructional videos on how to behave in the movie theater. By the time the movie started we felt like we had been assaulted. It was the worst movie going experience I have ever had. I will never go to Universal Studios again. EVER.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mackie0
40,"Fun Place to Eat, Shop and Drink","It seems to be always crawling with tourists, but there are a lot places to explore - eat, drink and shop at. There is usually some time of live entertainment going on as well. Leave yourself lots of time and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShariandRob753
40,Fun Place to Spend the Day!,"Universal City Walk is a great place to go spend the day walking, shopping, and having fun. The restaurants are fun. You can even go indoor skydiving here. People-watching is a great activity here too. If you are in the Los Angeles area and find yourself with extra time on your hands, Universal City Walk is a great place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teachkindy
20,Merch city,"Just like downtown Disney, this contrived ""town"" is simply an outdoor mall featuring stores for every niche need from popcorn to socks. Restaurants are all chains like bubba gump and Johnny Rockets. If you need a Simpsons coffee mug or transformers keychain, this is the place. Otherwise, plenty of other places in Hollywood to spend your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajdial
50,Great Shopping and Food,"This has fabulous shops if you are looking for gifts! Lots of Minions and old school stuff like Wizard of Oz or Marilyn Monroe etc. There is an awesome lolly shop that sells Bacon flavoured everything haha like toothpaste, dental floss, chewing gum! Must see!!We ate at the Gordan Ramsey Restaurant there and it was great! Good price and great food :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greciangoddess
40,Exciting place!!!,One day is not enough to visit Universal Studios. So my sisters and I decided to see City Walk a day after to gave ourselves time to shop and explore the place. We were not disappointed to give ample time for ourselves. We started before the park and some stores opened so we had the best of time to took pictures without too much crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/madeang
40,Cool place for food and drinks!,"After spending the day at Universal yesterday, I had the chance to explore City Walk and everything it had to offer.The place was crawling with tourists from everywhere in the World. There are so many great options for dining there including the Hard Rock Cafe which had pretty cool band related items. This is a great place to hang out and eat for a few hours and the cool thing is that it's Free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveRainville99
50,Family Favorite,"I love visiting this place. I take my nephews here for movies and then we enjoy some food afterwards. You can't beat the selection. From Bubba Gumps to Tommie's Burgers, whatever your taste buds desire, there is sure to be a restaurant to satisfy your craving. The atmosphere is fantastic. There are always extra things going on including live music, various performances etc. If you really want adventure, Universal Studios is only a short walk away. General Parking is $10 and you get a $5 rebate if you go to the movies. Priority parking makes no sense. It's not really closer as they advertise and garage keeps your car cool during the hot summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/demingj2481
50,"Atmosphere, shops, eateries","I could have spent hours here. We were too late for a studio tour, but it didn't matter - there was so much to see and do here. Loads of Geek shops in one place, enough of a novelty in itself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265NeilW
40,Lots to see and do,"My daughter's dance troupe performed on the stage here which allowed us plenty of time to have a look around whilst they got ready for the performance.I don't think people allocate much time, if any to this place when they visit the better known Universal Studios. This is a shame as there are delightful shops to look at and so many choices for lunch etc. spoilt for choice really.I'd suggest that perhaps those visiting Universal Studios get a pass out and have a nicer lunch rather than the typical park food.Definitely worth a walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/739careym
40,Lots to see.,"It is pretty expensive, but there are lots of shops and food spots. Some really good souveniere shops, and they're pretty much priced the same in the park so it didn't matter whether we got them in or out of the park. They had a Dodgers store which was cool and overall it was an ok experience. Take lots of $$,especially if you have kids.lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjnlina
30,Universal City Walk,It was good. Mostly restaurants. Some shops. Always worth at least one visit every couple of years. The hotel where we stayed offered a free shuttle. That was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhinestoneLady
40,Universal Citywalk Hollywood,I got a smoothie at Jamba Juice and it was good. I got a cup of ice from the Hard Rock Cafe Restaurant. We ate at a Mexican Restaurant (I don't remember the name) and the Margaritas were good and the appetizers: soft tacos were average. We went to John Lovitz' Comedy showroom and saw a Free Comedy show that included 8 Comedians. The Comedians were funny and the alcoholic beverages were good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/749robinr

40,Fairly decent shopping area.,"We parked at Woody Woodpecker preferred on the way to the park and managed to go through twice.The store selection was good and it even includes a movie theater which we didn't know that we had a movie rebate for parking in preferred on our reciept.With the exception of indoor skydiving you won't find anything too far out of the ordinary, but City Walk is worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65mattm
50,What a great place to spend a few hours,We had a group of 57 people and everyone loved city walk. We went there two times during our stay in California and everyone enjoyed there time. So many Resturants and places to shop. They even have an opportunity to sky dive - where you get into this tube with air blowing up to hold you up while your flying. It was pricy but it was great fun to watch,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geogh3
40,Nice way to start and end your day at Universal Studios,"I was here on vacation and went to the city walk for dinner on two nights. I loved the atmosphere at night, with all the lights, music and entertainment. Great place to take pictures, walk around and shop or just people watch. Only complaint would be the price for parking but to be expected for that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Casi702
40,A Must!,I would say there is quite a difference when you walk in during the day and when you walk out when it's night. The lights are excellent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noniet2014
40,Okay place to spend a few hours...,"Though a $15 parking space on weekdays may discourage you from coming here, don't stop at the parking lot. Keep on walking in. Universal's CityWalk is a smaller and less-crowded Downtown Disney, with restaurants such as Johnny Rockets, the Hard Rock Cafe, and Buca di Beppo.We drove from downtown Burbank to Universal Studios, which takes about fifteen minutes, for a weekday lunch and dinner. After parking and walking in, we sat down in an empty Hard Rock Cafe. Later on, when we came back for dinner, the CityWalk was more crowded, with lots of shops open.There are some interesting shops and restaurants in the Universal CityWalk, including an iFly that is outside, not inside a building. If you're in the area, spend a few hours walking around the Universal CityWalk and enjoy your surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelFamily2015
40,Fun Few Hours at Universal City Walk,"Universal City Walk is a fun place to spend for a few hours. Parking can be expensive at $15, but if you come Monday - Friday 11am - 3pm, valet parking is only $2 for up to 2 hours if you get a validation from any restaurant, retail or entertainment venue. This excludes AMC Cinemas and CityWalk carts. When you drive to Universal, remember to stay to the left to go to the Valet at the Jurassic Park Parking structure, and follow the signs to valet park.We love Popcornopolis and shopping at Hot Topic. There's such a variety of places to eat and snack on! It can be a fun place to visit and less crowded mid week, compared to the weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennShio
40,Extra,"OK we went there strictly to see a taping of the Extra TV show with Mario Lopez. You are right up front for the taping but check the schedule to be sure Mario is there. We went there late afternoon for a personality interview, but it was Clarissa doing the interview. We went back the next morning and saw virtually the whole show.

40,Fun to walk around!,"We stayed at the Sheraton Universal which is a short 6 minute walk from CityWalk. We came up for dinner one night and had a good time with our almost 7 year old son. Kind of feels like being at a big mall. That's the kind of food and shopping to expect. Panda Express, Subway, Pizza Hut, Tony Roma's, Karl Strauss, a Brazilian all-you-can-eat-meat place, Mexican place, BBQ, several other options. No shortage of junk food, from buckets of mini donuts to Popcornopolis, Ben & Jerry's, Yogurtland and more. There's also a bowling alley and movie theater. This place is a tween dream and the majority of people there were in that demographic. Anyway, it's a fun place to cruise around before/after Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/182melissam
30,Quick bite to eat and shopping,"Need a quick bite to eat or some unique shopping at some stores, then CityWalk is a good and quick place to visit especially towards the evening.

Head over during the day to Universal theme park for fun with family or friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Terminator1138

50,Fun even without the park!,"We went to the Universal City Walk without going to the park, and had a fantastic time! There are plenty of shops and quality restaurants to spend an afternoon. You can find any souvenirs that you haven't found on your LA trip while you're here. It's an easy Metro trip on the Red Line to the Universal Station, from which you can follow the signs to the shuttle that brings you up the mountain of a hill to the City Walk. We enjoyed our time there and I highly recommend it, especially to anyone staying in the Hollywood area that needs a break from the main strip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RyanTravels24
50,Adventure walking,This place is pretty neat! I like all the visuals and play on words. Such as 'Jurassic Parking' with a t-rex holding car keys.

40,We saw the hollywood sign here,In the back of this complex they have a very nice view of the Hollywood sign..One of the best we saw while in Hollywood. It also has a lot of retail stores and places to eat. Good spot to relax for a bit if your tired of walking around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,Glitzy Outdoor Mall,"This is just another shopping mall with the same old stores and theatres, clubs and bars but it's dressed up to look like a special event. We didn't mind walking around after we did the studio attraction. You won't miss anything if you don't see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brodie52
50,Cool as vibe & great selection of eats,"Went here on way into Universal and then came back out to get some lunch. Was excellent vibe due to being Christmas week, clean & pretty.

50,Best at night time!,"Night time visit is definitely well worth it. The whole citywalk is lit up and makes for great photos and its a nice walk, great tourist atmosphere with lots of different places to eat as well as a few huge souvenir stores and other fashion stores. The universal studios globe is at the end of the citywalk and infront of the entrance to the studios. Parking is $10 and its free admission to the citywalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FoxMustang

40,"For a first timer, it will be entertaining, for a recurring visitor it will get old","For a first timer, it will be very entertaining to see the overall complex, the music, the crowds, the food and shoping options. I enjoy it for the atmosphere. However, it is not the type of palce that I would want to visit more than once a year. The format of the place has not really changed in years since there is not alot of land to expand.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chicago90Phoenix

30,OK I Guess...,"Coming from NY, when we hear ""Great shopping and Dining"", I expect a bit more than a 15 minute walk past trinket shops and a few restaurants. Then the $17 bucks to park was like I was home again... We took in a movie which offset the cost a little, then had a meal (separate review), then left to ride around town. I hate to say it, but meh...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NY-Hormiga

40,Lots of shops and food!,"We came here after a taping of The Voice and did a little shopping before leaving (we got free parking from the show so we figured it was smart to check out CityWalk while we had it). It's a nice walk at all times of the day and there are many shops and places to eat! It's open aired so dress accordingly of the weather isn't cooperating when you plan on going. Follow the walkway to the end and you'll find the giant, iconic Universal globe and some fun signage without having to go into the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/990christinag
50,Great Place to Visit - Lots to see & do!,We loved Universal City Walk - We just enjoyed the day walking and going through the tons of shops that are located there. This is right off the Metro Line so if you have access to the Metro you must not miss this place - it's really great. Lot's of souvenier shops and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734patp
50,Just Awesome!,"I came here about 3 times during my trip to LA, loved every minute of it. So many places to eat and shop. The cinema there is great too, really big with comfy seats. The design of the place is like you're on movie set which is so fun. If you're in LA for some shopping like I was then I would absolutely recommend coming here and having a look around even if you don't buy anything (which would be impossible to do :p) it's just a great atmosphere to be a part of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sue-add

If you go to Universal Studios, chances are you'll be walking through CityWalk to get to Universal Studios.City walk is basically a nice outdoor shopping and dinning attraction. They have lot of unique specialty shopping stores and gift stores. They also have lots of restaurants, snack shops, and a food court.There is also Jillian's bowling and arcade, and an indoor sky diving attraction.Several of the restaurants have full service bars.There is also a large cinemaplex movie theater located at the CityWalk.This is a great place to go eat, drink and shop.I would recommend this place to all of my family and friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23
50,What fun!,We really enjoyed City Walk with all the restaurants and shops. It's kind of like Downtown Disney but with more of the Universal Studios caractures. We also saw Mario Lopez on Monday morning filming EXTRA. There is a schedule of his filming times by the big Universal Globe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/184tjf
30,Universal stores,Universal CityWalk is the name given to the entertainment and retail area adjacent to the Universal theme park. Its an area known for dining and shopping mainly after you leave the theme park. Its not as extensive as the equivalent walk at Disneyland but its worth exploring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,Went in Nov,"It was a great place to look around. They had good restaurants, movie and shops. Love the big King Kong. It was kind of a shame that Universal does not sell some of the old monster stuff anymore, only the recent stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tcard2013
50,So much fun!,"There was so much to see here! my husband and I had a great time exploring the area and we spent a lot of time just wandering, always seeing something new.

Night time looks like Vegas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U331JWjenniferb

40,WOW!,"Wonderful open air mall! Lots of popular stores, some I am familiar with, and some new ones...all having their own uniqueness.I visited during the 2014 Holiday and loved the hugh, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. The outdoor concert was nice but I wish the singer would have sang more songs in English. I'll give Universal a break and assume that an English talent was on later after we left. All-n- all it was a nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/almondhlth
30,Take a Walk,"Though there are many stores and many places to eat here, I never say to myself, ""Hey, let's waste time at Citywalk!"" Parking is $+/-$16 but there are many offers for a reduced fee with a promotional bundle like with a movie ticket or dinner. There are things to do here, like indoor skydiving, running though water jets or watching a comedy show, but the main pull is it's next to Universal Studios theme park. You can find cheap eats here, and they tape an entertainment show outside the park. If I do end up watching a movie here though, I will eat lunch/dinner here and aimlessly walk through the quirky shops for fun. One word for you: carpool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ntitled1
30,"If you like food, shopping and people watching...","Don't expect too much here..ITs not like a ton of fun and we debated whether to come here after dinner, spend $10 parking just to peruse here or not. But we did again but we knew what to expect. ITs good to just walk through it, do some souvenir shopping, see the lights and music at night, drink some Starbucks while people watching, take some pictures, run through a tiny water park even if its cold and look at the overpriced restaurants that you can eat at another night. That's about all we did but our large family from little ones to teens to us still had fun. IT just felt tiring because we had a long day but we got some shopping done, had fun listening to a local singer albeit a bad one and the giant screen TV blasting songs and a concert while kids twirled around under the lights. All in all we weren't too disappointed because we knew what to expect so don't go there thinking there are rides, lots of things to do and big excitement :) Its not all that but fun to go and visit if you haven't been. Eat some ice cream or have a sweet treat and just enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/livelovex7
30,Ok but nothing special,We came here to go to the Dodgers shop specifically. There are plenty of good shops and chain food outlets. The main problem we had was the $25 we had to pay to park. For a glorified shopping street it felt a bit much! Will be great if you had kids and there are plenty of food photo ops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaraL495
50,"UNIVERSAL,CA",You will love this place We had a group from age 66-1. Everyone had fun! The weather was cold but we still had fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianne000
30,Small and just ok,We went on a Wednesday night and ate at the Hard Rock as we always do if there is one near where we are. The city walk itself is pretty small. If you've been to the one in Orlando you will probably be disappointed with this one. It nowhere near as cool. Some neat stores and plenty of food options. Definitely worse ways to spend a couple of hours in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spyingeyes
40,Go at NIGHT!,"Our family enjoyed our evenings spent at the CityWalk. We were staying in the Hilton, within walking distance, so we did not have to deal with the parking fees as some people have mentioned. It really is very cool when it's lit up. Lots of food options (we ate at Hard Rock cafe....food was terrible but the atmosphere ROCKS). Worth a walk around if you're at Universal Studios or surrounding areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNgirl73
40,Wow.....,"We were here on Sunday December 21st to celebrate my birthday & Solstice.What a pleasant surprise, it was rather fun. I liked the Popcornopolis (all natural, no GMO & Fresh), the young people in the shops were extremely nice.I didn't like the restaurant (see my review of Samba), they didn't even validate parking.We got a bit lost in the parking lot (and the valet boy were rude & unhelpful... giving WRONG Directions)...But it a good thing to do for a night out. I might even do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Auntie-Nanuuq
40,Lots of Photo Ops,"Ok, Universal City Walk is a tourist trap, but it has a lot of photo op opportunities without spending a ton of money. We entertained two Japanese exchange students with a day in L.A. Took the train from Sierra Madre (All day pass- $7.00 plus $1.00 if you don't have a TAP card) and disembarked at Union Station. Walked through Olvera Street, had lunch at Phillipe's, and then back on the train to Universal City. It was a short walk to the tram that took us right outside the City Walk area. There were literally dozens of photo ops around every corner: King Kong, Bubba Gump's, Hard Rock giant guitar, Universal Studios globe and entrance gate, etc., etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirkk578
40,Beautiful views on the city,Loved this place. I visited last week after visiting the Universal park. Ate at Bubba Gump and the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. The place is already for the holidays. Plenty shopping to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammied3000
10,"No cell phone coverage, stupid parking rules","As many others have mentioned, this is a tourist trap and an expensive place to visit, but it is a major entertainment destination for a lot of people from across the country. That is why I find it unbelievable that the cell phone coverage is sooooo poor here. I stopped here earlier this week only because the evening rush hour traffic on the way to Bakersfield was so bad, I got off the freeway and went to the first place that I could find. I parked in the Frankenstein area which was right across from the Saddle Ranch Chop House. Once I was seated and got over the shock of the menu prices, I looked at my T-Mobile phone - no coverage, none, zero, no data, not even phone! My Verizon phone had no data and 1 bar for phone calls. When I told the waitress the problem, she indicated that while the reception was marginally better in another area of the restaurant (on my T-Mobile phone it showed 1 bar 3G in that area), it was a problem all throughout City Walk. I did not walk around CityWalk to confirm, instead I left. To add insult to injury, however, even though I had only been parked 10 minutes, the parking attendant wanted to charge me the full $15 as I did not get the restaurant to validate my parking ticket. After I complained and the attendant went to talk to his manager, he told me that they could apply the validation discount so I would only pay $5. I again reminded him that it had been 10 minutes, I did not have dinner and I was leaving because there was no cell coverage in a major entertainment venue. I was so frustrated and still had to get dinner and finish the 2+ hour drive to Bakersfield that I paid the $5 and left. I will never go back to CityWalk. Why is customer service, courtesy and common sense so hard to find anymore?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikegeee57
40,Go at night!,"During the day I can only imagine how boring this must be. We ended up going here by pure accident and really enjoyed it for the most part. We walked up the hill which is quite a hike but I think it was worth it in the end. The lights are so much fun and all the stores are open late so you can just browse and not worry about them closing. Lots of restaurants and some street performers as well. It's not too big so you can meander for a while and still finish up quickly. It wasn't very busy when we were there, and it was a Friday night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristenmerke
40,Great experience,"Great experience however it is long and a bit mental! You will see everything from people smoking joints to the typical rambling woman walking up and down, if you know what I mean...Don't let that intimidate you it is all part of the Hollywood experience :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gemz1701
20,Universal CityWalk,"Get ready to pay up every little bit you have as they will charge you for everything. The parking was around $10 and you will have to walk through Universal CityWalk to get to the amusement park.What you can find here is alot of shops which are quite expensive, slow walking, lots of awesome tourists like me. This place is over rated but very busy.The best thing is go to the park and just browse after the fact. As tourist you are limited on time and this is not the place to spend much of the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BSurahyo
30,"Interesting, quaint and smaller than Orlando's city Walk","What is not to like, shops, neon signs, plenty of places to dine and nightlife. We opted check out City Walk to do some shopping and grab something to eat. We quite enjoyed our time here walking around here and soaking up the liveliness. Definitely worth checking out for a bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiouspb
50,Very Fun and LIVE,"There's lots of lights to see and during the holiday season they have santa there taking pictures in a sleigh and they make it snow every hour in the evenings. Dining is a bit on the higher end, but they also got lots of small eatery's as well. Lots of things to do for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415dannys
30,Nice but not really worth a special visit,"We strolled around after visiting Universal Studios and found a great italian restaurant at the far end (reviewed separately). It was enjoyable, plenty to see, lots of different shops, cafes, bars, restaurants, cinema, entertainers, big screen show, etc. But it's just a big mall really with nothing to make it worth a special visit - ok if you're there anyway.The transport links weren't obvious and the signage wasn't helpful. We needed a taxi back to our downtown hotel and were told we'd get one at the far end where we'd eaten but it was only a pickup for pre-arranged transport. Had to walk all the way back to the studios end to find a taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rufford155

50,VIP Spectacular :),"We decided to buy the VIP experience, which cost around £800 for 5 adults. We were very lucky in that we had a tour guide all to ourselves. He was great fun and very knowledgeable of the park and its history. The many highlights of the tour was walking around the sets of Back to the Future, Pirates of the Caribbean and Psycho. My better halve loved the walk through costume design and the prop store. We were also very lucky to walk around a live set in sound stage 12. The park wasn't that busy so the queues weren't that long anyway but it was still great to walk past those that were queuing. The inclusive lunch was exceptional quality, so don't miss it....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanR986

Was able to do quite a bit of shopping to bring home gifts for my family. (There was something available for EVERYONE.) At night the CityWalk is beautiful when lit up and my traveling companions and I were impressed by the curbside taxi service that was available. My only complaint is that items along the CityWalk are rather overpriced. If you are looking for a deal, it would be rare to find it here. Most of the items I purchased are available in my hometown for a substantially cheaper price...(But it didn't stop me from buying. ;D)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreapS480YZ

Citywalk is like one gigantic out door mall on steroids because of the many retail shops, restaurants, movie theatre, clubs, bowling alley, bars, etc. On the weekends and summer time this place gets very hectic! Parking isn't that bad only 10 bucks for general not a far walk at all and the atmosphere is perfect for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PostCommander

30,For tourists...,"This shopping area does have a very nice ambience to it especially at night when all the colorful lights are on. Lots of stores to buy souvenirs and lots of eateries for sure. However, everything is so overpriced here especially the restaurants and snack stores. But let's face it, most people walking around are from out of town and are willing to spend which is great for the economy. Overall, it is a nice place to hang out after a day at Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharka_boy
50,An open mall with lots of things to do,"Good food, lots of good energy around the area and during the summer it is a very good place to be.

50,Great before and After Park diversion.,"Lots of eating opportunities and quite a variety of stores, toss in a couple of clubs and attractions and you have a fun place to kill some time before and/or after a visit to Universal Studios. The buildings are fun to look at and the stores fun to browse (and shop). You can find everything from Fine dining, to casual dining to fast food. Really has something for everyone.

30,Mini-Vegas!,"Strolled thru CityWalk after a long day at Universal. The lights were just starting to come on and the crowds were heavy, so it felt like walking the Las Vegas strip at night.

40,"Lots of stores, eateries and occasional entertainment next to Universal Studios","Overall I rate this somewhere between 3-4 stars. The best thing is that it offers numerous dining options right next to Universal Studios. So after a day at the park you can sit down and eat somewhere other than inside the amusement park without having to get in your car. There are several restaurants as well as a food court (note the food court is on the second level). Some of the prices seemed a bit high, but there's a decent selection to choose from. There's also an interesting selection of stores to walk through, very typical of a tourist destination. They have a stage and occasional varied entertainment, depending on your timing. We happened to catch a couple of DJs playing EDM which my wife loved. And there's a large multiplex movie theater that we didn't go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArnyE
40,Fun place to kill a couple of hours.,This place is full of exciting shops and fun places to eat as well as a movie theater and many other attractions. It's fun to see if both in the late afternoon when the lights are off and then to come back and visit at night. Some of the places are quite pricey. But it's a fun place to go before or after your visit to Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelpilot65
40,Enjoyable,"Universal City Walk is the area which you walk through from the parking lot to the entrance to Universal Studios. It is packed with shops and restaurants, all of which are glitzy and attractive, and all of which are designed to part you from your cash! Having said that, there is an atmosphere to it, it is an entertaining stroll, and the venues are all good quality and good value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/265NeilW
20,Very touristy,I've never taken to this place. I've visited a few times and only ever after a trip to Universal Studios. I find it tacky and annoying. Why?The limited atmosphere is manufacturedThe restaurant choices are boringEvery spare seat outside is taken by a tired touristThe 'square' is always empty and blasting loud music,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/beryan

30,Nothing special,"I'm not really sure what I expected, but it was clearly not for me.

Lots of shops, music, attractions nice atmosphere.It does get busy in the restaurants and it is a good idea if you're organised to book a meal beforehand. We didn't and still got a nice meal with minimal waiting time really. We ate in a Mexico place and it was lovely.I loved Universal Studios and was really glad that I visited. You must go of course but if you're my age just take your time and sit down taking everything in.Enjoy,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suitcase0810
40,Busy Busy Busy,"How many things can be crammed into a fake city space? I do have to give them credit...if you can think it, you can buy it here. With restaurants and shops lining both sides of the sidewalk, it's easy to spend everything you bring here. If you want pizza, they have it. If you want steak, they have it. If you want candy...they have that too. Clothes, foods, drinks, and some of the most interesting looking people and outfits that I have ever encountered filled this place up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jrpleasant
30,Pretty Touristy,"Kind of a Universal Studios trap. It is an interesting spot for out of towners. It does get pretty busy, parking is a bit steep, the restaurants are cliche of a Hollywood type atmosphere. It is an interesting spot to spend an hour or 2 checking things out, but overall, not impressed. Limit your time there to avoid the droves of teens going to watch movies and all the tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonn479
30,tourists,"be prepared to walk behind and around tourists. Living in LA, I avoid Citywalk -- they have a nice theater and the only Element Store around, so other than actually going to Universal I stay away.

They have lots of shops and restaurants along the walk, and also a water play area for small kids. During our recent visit to Universal Studios, we came out of the park to eat lunch (to avoid the long lines at the food stands inside the park) and then reentered the park to finish our day. Definitely worth visiting even if you don't go to Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cohoman

30,"Fun, but Pricey","If you are already at Universal, then worth poking around for some touristy stuff. However, not much there. Parking is $10 after 3 p.m. if you just want to go walk around. Best thing there is IFly, indoor skydiving. Pretty expensive, check their website for specials.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/700sarao
30,Nice stroll after universal studios,"Came here for the evening after a day at universal studios. It is an outdoor mall that goes in a loop, with more eateries upstairs.We opted for Bubba Gump Shrimp Co which was delicious but was quite a wait.Mall wasn't as big as I expected and the shops were ok - a few of the big chains like Abercrombie, but also a fair share of random & rather average stores selling souvenirs and shoes. Wouldn't say this is a ""shopping destination"" but a ""might as well"" after universal studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NZ_Joy
50,Good for people watching,"There is nothing special about this place at all. The stores are nothing out of this world, the restaurants or fast paced and services generally poor, long waits and not much to do. It is basically a shopping mall with lots of neon lights attached to a huge tourist attraction!But what about walking around? You can pay the half the parking fee or you could park below the hill and take the little trolley free of charge from a bus stop to the top. Once on top, they have staples of decent stores such as Starbucks and Tony Roma's. Once again, the service is not the same as these stores have zillions of people zipping in and out!Since I have lived in the Los Angeles area, I have not walked around here. It was interesting and fun to say I have now been here but I don't think I would go out of my way again to go here again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler4k

30,Nice but it can be expensive....,"Another version of Disney Downtown with its shops, attractions, entertainment, dining and more! It was great to check this out but once was enough for us. We stayed, shopped, went for a 10-minute massage, dined at Wasabi Sushi restaurant (very good!) and watched a movie as it was opening night for Guardians of the Galaxy movie. Kept cleaned and maintained and more space to move around. Better than being inside the park. There is indoor parking (great for hot days) and easily accessible to the CityWalk and Theme park (fee was $20). There is also a focus on recycling which was nice to see. You really do not have to spend any money.....you can just easily bring your own picnic, sit down and watch the people walk by.....very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marites8
50,"A fun place to people watch, shop, hang out, have something to eat.","Universal City Walk is a unique and unusual place... It's mainly for shopping, and there are a LOT of different types of stores here to browse through, like Abercrombie & Fitch, GUESS Accessories, Billabong, Fossil, and Element, to name a few. There are also nice places to eat or just to have coffee and watch the people walk by. There's Buca di Beppo, a fun family Italian restaurant, Johnny Rocket's diner, Karl Strauss Brewing Company, Hard Rock Cafe Hollywood, Tony Roma's, and even a Brazilian Steakhouse! For coffee, why not stop off at Starbucks or The Coffee Bean Teaq Leaf. There's also frozen yogurt, Jamba Juice, and my FAV, Cinnabon! There's also a slew of quick food- like KFC and Pizza Hut Express, Pink's Famous Hot Dogs, Tommy's World Famous Burgers and MORE!It can get very crowded and loud, especially at night, so if you're not into crowds, try to avoid it during this time. However, it IS really amazing to see at night, when all the big signs are lit up!*There is no entry fee for City Walk, but keep in mind that if you want to park in the lot, it's NOT free! In fact, the lowest amount for parking in the underground structure is $10 for general parking (self parking) and goes up in price depending where you park, and what time of day. There is a discount on parking when you buy movie tickets, and there is also Valet parking, which is much more expensive. An option to save money for parking is to find a spot somewhere outside the park area/like on the street, and walk up the hill. It takes more time, but will cost you less for parking in the end. Just make sure that if you park on the street somewhere, you pay attention to the parking rules/signs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leesag2013

50,"Fun Food, Fun Stores, Fun People","We would come here when we lived in Orange County, but it has been almost 10 years since our last visit since we moved out of state. We stayed within walking distance of the City Walk and really enjoyed spending the evenings there. We tried the Bubba Gumps, Hard Rock, and a few of the small boutique food places. Hubby and I loved the piano bar and the kids loved the frozen yogurt and funnel cake fries at one of the shops. There are boutique shopping places there are slightly overpriced but you would expect that with all the tourists there. We enjoyed the movie theater and the kids broke out into an impromptu dance performance right in front of the City Walk stage. Such a fun place when all the lights come on and the music is playing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaH637

40,"Fun and free, but hard not to spend money","The thing that I really love about CityWalk is it's technically free, so as a place to people watch and hang out before or after a movie or dinner it's fantastic. The problem is its almost impossible not to spend money, and possibly a lot. To give you an example, here's three different ways to spend half a day or more at CityWalk on different budgetsFREE:Arrive on foot- metro and bus stops are nearbyPeople watch- indoor skydiving tube is especially good viewingWindow shop- neat specialty stores to poke aroundFree events- concerts and other events happen on the stageEat and drink- there are water fountains near bathrooms, tables near the food court you can use if you brought a snackMID-RANGE:Pay for parking- multiple parking decks, save $ with validation from the movieSee a movie- great theater, one of the areas few 3D IMAX screensEat and drink- lower cost options in the central area 2nd floor, Pizza Hut/KFC and the likeShop- plenty of mid-range stores to keep you busySPLURGE:Arrive in style-valets available at the main entranceSkydive- iFly Hollywood's indoor wind tunnel tube simulates skydiving free fall and is fun for allEat and drink- choose from a variety of higher end, sit down, theme restaurantsCatch a concert- at the Gibson AmphitheaterSpend the night- there are 2 hotels on the property with free shuttles to the main entrance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseMW

50,Great family fun,Lots of shops & Family restaurants to chose from. There are lots of people but the area is so large that it does not seem that crowded. Parking garage is huge with 6 levels that unloads really fast when you leave but costs $16.00 to park. Many places will validate some of the fees. The AMC movie cineplex gave us $14.00 in cash. Plan on several hours if you want to eat or shop. Plenty of fun people watching too. It is just off the 101 Freeway so very easy to get to. It a busy place but worth the crowds.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler225
40,Nice spot to extend your trip,"If you're going to Universal Studios, stop in here afterwards for some food and shopping. You'll see a giant King Kong and a giant Hard Rock Cafe Guitar, and there's a nice series of take-out eaters up on the second floor overlooking a giant video screen for entertainment while you eat. You might even see some bargains in the souvenir shops, as I did. For example, I found LA caps for only $2.50 plus tax. Much better deal than what you can find in the park itself. Take an hour or so to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Freed0mt0travel
50,Kids loved it!,After a full day at universal studios this was the perfect finish to an awesome day.The kids loved all the shops an our 15yr old loves shopping in hot topic! This was a highlight for him.Definitely worth the time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lisacunningham01
30,Shop and Eat,We visited the city walk to go to Hard Rock to get pins and ate at Bubba Gump. The city walk is nothing but shops and places to eat that are all national chains. They need some other things to do like in Orlando with putt putt golf. Parking is also not free but only $10 after 3PM. The park guests also empty out around dinner time so expect a wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmonstrola
40,My son loved it!,"There are several restaurants and shops to visit. My son loved the jumbo screen that showed videos and played music. They have an arcade that sells food and has a full service bar, which I was glad to see after a long day in Universal Studios. They also have indoor skydiving there and a night club if you want to get some adult time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/178LM
40,A great city walk,"We visited this more than we have done any citywalk. It has a good selection of restaurants and shops, a movie theatre and a great atmosphere. The hard rock here is especially good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pickyperson910
50,Universal Citywalk Hollywood is GREAT!,Hadn't been to Universal Studios in MANY years. Was amazed at how they've built up the Citywalk. Exciting to walk through all the neat stores and restaurants. Builds the anticipation before entering Universal Studios and then at night after leaving the lights and music just add to the overall experience. Fun place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OR317
40,Excellent for what it is,"We enjoyed CityWalk as a way to end a long day at Universal Studios. Our grandkids enjoyed the shops and various entertainment opportunities. We enjoyed the chance for a meal together in a reasonably quiet restaurant. Of course, it is a tourist trap filled with over-priced cheap souvenirs and t-shirts, but there is a certain ""Hollywood"" charm to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwazycanucks
50,Great great fun,This is an area just outside Universal Studios it has some of the best stores restaurants and bars in all of LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ET-retired
20,Meh,This place is full of tourist traps and actually not that different from other similar places. I can have same experience without flying all the way to Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rvs-ru
40,Good way to spend the evening,We stayed just down the road and spent most nights here. Good range of food and shops. Good people watching as well I'm sure a hidden camera show was being filmed while we were there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817rhysm
30,Not the friendliest place on earth!,"It's a free attraction, shops, restaurants, night clubs and theaters and more. I was looking forward to the experience. Parking is bit hefty considering you are going there to spend money and really don't have a choice other than 16.00 or 25.00 to park! The parking attendant was cold and unresponsive, no smile, no ""have a good time"", must be a boring job? We needed directions once we missed our turn to the parking structure, which by the way is very confusing and NOT CLEARLY MARKED! So we had to ask to re-enter and was told where to park. But the condescending tone of the security guard at the entry gate was far from what I expected from a first contact guest agent. Either he is sick and tired of people like me having to be re admitted and told how to get there or he hates his job?! Either way they need to get better signage and directions in place to avoid such confusion. Once there you will find it charming! We ate at Wolfgang Pucks Bistro and really enjoyed an afternoon meal on the front deck just people watching and munching on a lite meal. Overall, I would tell anyone to go, but don't expect the staff to be warm and fuzzy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dpjkona
40,Good way to end a night.,"There is plenty of parking, not something I would necessarily worry about. They have a nice movie theatre and plenty of restaurant options. They have quite a bit of shops but they don't offer anything you can't find anywhere else and are rather pricey. I am going back in about a week to go to IFLY Hollywood which I saw last time I visited but I couldn't because my family didn't want to. It seems like the closest thing next to skydiving and flying! Overall it is just a nice place to take a stroll at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/734berenicep
50,Always a delight!,This is our stop after a fun-filled day at Universal Studios. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from. They even have a food court. It's spectacular place to visit at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339teresah
40,Everything in one place!,"There was enough variety in the shops & things to do that it kept my husband, myself, & our two teenage girls entertained for a couple of hours! Great atmosphere. No fee to visit but you do have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherF888
50,Well done with a lot to do in one place,"This is one of those places where it's a good idea to research out everything available before going and making a plan. Citywalk alone is quite an experience, almost like ""what would happen if a movie director wanted to make a happy looking Gotham City."" There is a theater, clubs, shops, restaurants, all at a slightly higher than normal price but basically it's a ""tax"" for being in a micro city dedicated to working out how to make you have lots of fun.The Universal studio tour is RIGHT off the citywalk, but you can look that up separately on tripadvisor (also very worth seeing particularly if you have never been there before).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P7256SDmichaelg
40,Great evening out!,If staying at the nearby Sheraton hotel Universal City Walk is great for an evening out. Plenty of places to eat/drink and some good entertainment such as a comedy club and a great bar for live music,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianL891
50,City walk,This place is so cool. There is so many things to see and especially with the kids. Here you can shop or like me enjoy the little eateries. This is an outdoor shopping centre and at night its spectacular seeing the walk light up.It has many shops to get sales as well a large number of restaurants to choose from.Next door is universal studios so instead of getting trapped in the park with the unlimited food they have why not take a break and see what the walk has to offer.Here they also have a Dodgers store to which blew me away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jodecirossi
50,Always entertaining!,"City walk is always entertaining. People watching, looking and popping into the shops, grabbing a bite to eat.....Food.....Pink's may have the best hot dogs but THE best fries in the WORLD are at Jodi Maroni's!Exhausted after a long day at the park...go get a water massage!Always lots of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mom-2-4boyz
50,Exciting,"So glad we got to wander through CityWalk after going to Universal studios for Halloween. All the glitz and glamor was pure Hollywood for us as first timers, it was great, lots of places to eat, drink and be merry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodgerskay
50,Great night life here,We spent three days at Universal Studios- Hollywood and closed every day with an evening at City Walk. Great choice of restaurants and shops. Even a large movie theater if you're interested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler222Irvine
40,Good place to take touristy guests,"I think the CityWalk in Orlando is much nicer, but still the Hollywood version serves it purpose. They get you for parking, but there are a number of shopping and dining options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betwigg
50,Bigger than Orlando!,"The LA version seems much bigger than Orlando. A lot more shops and places to eat. We got the Metro red line from the Hollywood walk of fame and it took about 15 minutes, and a few dollars (return), to get to the City Walk station. A short walk across the street to the free shuttle bus, and our journey took around 25 minutes in total.Parking is around $16 so, if there's five or less of you, it could be cheaper to get the Metro at $1.50 per ride!I'd definitely recommend a half day here. It has the atmosphere of a theme park and it's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerrypoint
10,Nothing to see,"I paid 16 dollars for parking..I excepted to see something special,a big street with a lot of attractions,but what I saw it was just a couple of shops with highest prices.This is not attractions at all.Don't waster your time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oyemeTravel
10,Poor,Why do I need to pay 15$ for parking just to walk across the city?General parking 15$Front parking ~26$Everything was built with plastic and low quality material.Just for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/igora663
30,Not bad,"My wife and I went here to kill an afternoon and watch a movie in the evening. There's really not a ton of stuff to do. There's plenty of restaurants and some shops, but overall, not sure what the big deal is. We ended up having to go to a restaurants and just sit at the bar and kill an hour before the movie because we got bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MNSiouxFan
40,Very crowded,"My family and I decided to try to avoid the Disneyland rush and check out Universal Studios instead. We had never been before. we bought tickets through my husbands work. When we arrived fashionably late it was a huge long line just to get our tickets that we bought online over 45 minutes! Nuts. Then each ride or attraction was at least 45 minutes to an hour wait. We saw the whole park because we knew we were never coming back again. Stayed late. That being said we really enjoyed the great special effects and attractions themselves. I just don't need to ever do it again, it was just way too packed. At some point couldn't even walk because the streets were too full. I recommend going off season for sure. We went in April.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Renegade01
50,Amazing place to visit especially at night,"Awesome place to visit after big day at universal studios, shops and great places to eat. Highly recommended to anyone visiting the area. Even if you don't go into universal studios it self at least stop by and check this place out",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puls3
40,Good shops sights & sounds,Good way to kill some time as we arrive for the park but we were early. nice place to grab a few trinkets & laugh at the souvenirs,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lasqueezee
40,Come at night,"Just walking from one end to another, sitting on sidewalk plant box sides, shopping for souvenirs, eating yummy foods, sitting on a park bench specially around the Globus of the Universal Studios watching people taking photos/selfie, is fun. It is more interesting to come in the night with all the beautiful lights and more life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BabieGo
50,LA TRIP,"We have enjoyed the Citywalk. It is walking distance of our hotel which is great. We have tried several restaurants Bubba Gumps, Comanchos, and Hard Rock Cafe. Shopping is wonderful too especially since my favorite bath store, LUSH, is located on the walk. And let's not forget Ben and. Jerry's...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAnn5072
10,Shops and Restaurants (with a violent criminal dancing for your families entertainment?),"This is an obvious place to grab dinner after a day at Universal Studios Theme Park. Some fun shops, restaurants and other diversions. We were having a great time enjoying atmosphere and the big screen entertainment - a variety of pop music and videos shown in front of a large square where teens were dancing and having fun.Then they decided to play a video by Chis Brown. This seems an odd choice. He is currently in prison for assault and is known to have violently attacked a woman. Why would this be family entertainment? I could understand if he had served his time but he is currently in prison for parole violations. Why is Universal - who market themselves as a place for a family day out - supporting this criminal's career? I find it disturbing and it is totally out of step with the values I want to promote to my children. Violent criminals have no place as any part of my families recreation time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rtqp
50,It's fun and it's free,If you like shopping and eating this is the place you should go. After our universal studio tour we went to this place . Nice place to visit and it's free but some shops are pricey .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosievil
50,free and nice,"since i already went to disney, i decided not to pay for admisison into the universal studios park. going to the universal studios citywalk is a good and free alternative to actually paying to go into the park. it also saved me alot of time and hasle. btw, if you're just going to the gift shop, they have an official gift shop there too, restaurants as well. yo ucan also take a photo at the giant spinning globe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationer187

50,"Promenade of people, music, shopping and visual art sure to delight the senses while strolling","Promenade, part of the Universal Studio Complex , filled with great souvenir shops, restaurants, clubs, music and a very lively atmosphere,ideally suited for tourists visiting Los Angeles, or for locals out and about for fun and festive people watching.Great family friendly, fun crowd, "" must see stop""for tourists day or night and it's free!!( parking additional fee)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/overjo

40,love it!,"we always love visiting the city walk going into the souvenir shops, there are always lots of fab offers going on! The food is cheaper here than inside the park although inside isn't that expensive! its a nice walk to go on before/after the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nikkijr93
30,Stores and Restaurants,"If you like bright lights and a clean, safe place to go shop and eat this is a good choice in the evening. I went to the comedy club here I don't recommend it as the waitress is cranky, the guy that seats people is so intense and at least 3 of the comedians were too raunchy. One was so bad even the redneck looking guys were offended. I would have left but I was dead center and close to the front.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/818RS
40,Tourist spot. Extra is filmed here.,"During my stay at the Universal Hilton, I frequently came here to getmy meals. Do not try Bubba Gump's. Pinky's was worth the try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gots_2_travel
30,Boring in the early afternoon,"We had some time to kill before our flight so we walked around the city walk (plus it's free, except for parking). It looks like it would be really kinda fun at night but during the day it's boring! Just shops I wouldn't shop at and restaurants (for the most part they all looked good, but not great for lunch, dinner maybe!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Esayed84
30,Long trip to NOWHERE,Found the city walk not as WOW as I thought it would be. it was a strip mall. Taking the bus/tram up the hill was ok but it takes so long and gets so crowded that we definitely thought about walking. I have been back to LA since but neither my twelve year old nor I will be returning to Universal anything. Just felt it was a waste of time. Very very expensive!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesetteh
30,Nothing Special,"As has been written before, this place consists mostly of chain restaurants with higher than usual prices for me. There is some street entertainment as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/389billk
40,"Flashy, bright and busy!","Our second hotel was near Universal and ran a free shuttle service so we went across on the first night in the area. It was impressive! It's quite busy though, so can distract from the effort they've put in. It has Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump, Cinnabon etc. There are plenty of places to eat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JazzJPH
30,Expected a little more,"There's nothing wrong with CityWalk, I guess I just expected more. I was expecting it to be more like Downtown Disney in Florida and I would say this is about a 1/3 of the size. There were some great restaurants there but we didn't eat at any of them. There was a Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gumps, and several more. There was even a Ben and Jerry's ice cream shop. We went to IFly and a few of the souvenir shops. I guess if you are visiting Universal park this would offer a nice place to eat on your way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/threepowells
40,Cool place to go,City Walk had a number of restaurants including ones with lounges and a Jillian's. It was cute and a place to go if you are anout-of-towner and have no idea where you want to go out (like us).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeAndraB_13
40,Nice!,"We visited Universal over Christmas break. In order to get to the main gate from the Curious George (cheaper) parking lot, you have to walk through CityWalk. We were pleasantly surpised with the nice line up of shops and bars and restaurants to visit.Some of the shops had theme park merchandise, but others were regular mall stores like GameStop, Hot Topic and Jamba Juice. There is also a big movie theater, a comedy club and indoor skydiving.In the evening, we again walked through CityWalk to get back to our parking structure and it was very special all decked out for the holidays with special lights and music. It was very convenient and fun to have all those nice shops to visit on our way out. It definately added to the enjoyment of our day at Universal Studios. We look forward to visiting again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvTravelin92
40,Fun Way to Spend an Evening,"Having missed out on Citywalk during our last trip to Universal, we decided to spend an evening here this time around (even though we didn't go into the Universal theme park). This was almost an attraction in itself! There are great places to eat and shop here-we ate at the Hard Rock Cafe which was great. The atmosphere was great at night, with a lot of lights and music! Very energetic and happy place. Worth checking out, even if you're not planning on going to Universal!Tip: Make sure to take advantage of the free shuttle that Universal provides at the bottom of the hill; it's a long and steep climb up to Universal and Citywalk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caribby96
50,"A lot of restaurants,shopes and people.","A very visited site in LA is universal city and this place in particular has a lot of tourists, so get ready to walk trough hoards of people. The city walk has a lot of great restaurants, stores and even a movie theater so you can spend a whole day there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrPaulagrace
30,It's free and the parking isn't bad- $10 after 3pm,"Well this doesn't even come close to Orlando. I don't blame it on them, it's the space I guess. the best thing? you can have a Pink's Hot Dog without the line in Hollywood. Not many stores only one main Universal store and not lots of stuff...small and not too much to do. Made me miss Orlando",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sassysaint
30,Should Have Skipped It,"We had a free evening so we decided to check out the Universal CityWalk. After 3 p.m., parking is ""only"" $10.00. I'm not used to paying to park whenever I go shopping or out for dinner so I didn't really care for it. But we went anyway thinking that it would give us something to do and maybe provide some entertainment for the evening. There are shops and restaurants there along with a movie theater. If there was more, we missed it. So we paid to park so that we could spend money. We ended up eating there and then went back to the hotel. Wish we would have skipped it. (My fault - I should have researched it better.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaP740
30,"Great if at Universal, otherwise, skip!","Nothing to say bad about this, except its basically the entrance to Universal Studios. So expect to pay a premium for everything and anything here. Otherwise, cant complain. Its a big shiny tourist attraction in itself. A fun place to go and walk and/or people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PolishJinx
50,Interesting,"Passed through here during for the first time in 2009 as I was entering Universal Studios. Is really cool, wish I had time to stop and check out the stores and restaurants. Pretty neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanG3243
30,Nothing really exciting to see,"This place was a bit of a let-down. It's over-rated on trip advisor. I was expecting something extraordinary. Instead, I found a small strip of a ""city walk"" that would be better described as a flashy mall with extra light and sound. Would have better spent my time visiting other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mytravelid
40,CityWalk Rocks!,"CityWalk has sit down & fast food restaurants, shopping, multi-plex movie theatre, skydiving, more! It was fun to spend time there. It's great if you're staying at the hotels nearby and hitting Universal by day & CityWalk at night. We enjoyed the Hard Rock Cafe. One of the large Hard Rocks on two levels & with good food & service. The much hyped Saddle Ranch was just O.K. in both the service and the food departments. CityWalk was fun & we will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrontRowCenter
50,CITYWALK,"I love CityWalk, because of the food options, and the shopping options. The best part is CityWalk is not inside the theme park, which means that the cuisine here is GOOD! It is not theme park food! Theme park food is crappy food, at high prices. At CityWalk, the food is good, and the prices match how good the food is. Every shop and every restaurant here is awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeviTraveler
50,AWESOME SHOPPING!,"There is HEAPS of restaurants, stores and shopping outlets here, this is down played- I found so many great places, fromhot topic to comic shops to taco/burrito houses to a huge candy store- bubba gumps- and more. If travelling with a tour bus head here straight after universal-very short walk and worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/876angelf
50,Not Your Average Street,"Some of my family were entertaining a cousin from out of town so we took him to City Walk. City Walk is about four blocks long connecting parking to Universal Studios Tours with a vast collection of unique and not so unique stores and restaurants, a multiplex theater, and other entertainments in an exciting space. With so much shopping, dining, and entertainment, it always seemed odd that I have in the past taken UCLA Extension classes on the second floor above some of these shops. There are interesting sights in all directions from cars and spacecraft crashed into buildings to dancing fountains and a wave machine.You could just rush through on the way to the tours or spend all day in the shops, restaurants, multiplex theater, and other entertainments. Parking is a little steep, ranging from $16.00 for remote parking to $40.00 closer in. City Walk is no longer the route to the amphitheater because it is gone to make room for Harry Potter Land, but aside from that, it hasn't changed much from it's beginning, but doesn't show its age and is still a dynamic space to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
50,Good Food in a Dynamic Setting,"Several in my family were entertaining a cousin from another state and we decided City Walk would be a good place to do so. We selected Karl Strauss at random and later decided it was a good choice. We dined on a balcony overlooking one of the plaza areas of City Walk so there was activity to watch while awaiting our meal. The waitress was friendly and helpful. While I don't drink beer, there was a long list of fine beers that some in our group enjoyed. I had Ginger Encrusted Salmon which was quite good. So was the calamari. I think we all enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Enjoyable,"Major shopping and eating, overflow from the park and its OK. I would say depending on what you want or looking for you may be satisfied traveling through at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benniep395
40,save on parking take the metro red line to universal station,"I never came to this location until it became a stop on the metro red line. This place makes for a nice warm weather stroll and some window shopping. Anchoring this place is a large movie theater and a number of eateries from fast food to restaurants. Actually the selection is quite good and some of the more famous los angeles restaurants have satellite locations here like wolfgang puck, tomy roma's, hard rock. Also, if you want sportswear there are a number of shops selling apparel for the local teams.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
10,Seriously Worst Place in Hollywood; Don't Bother!,"I had the worst experience at CityWalk ever for New Years Eve. Never go here! I paid admission to get into a club and then $30 TO WALK TO THE CLUB because Universal is the shadiest organization. The staff was awful and unresponsive to any questions. On top of that one of my friends, who is 4' 10"" and 86 pounds, was escorted off property for ""being a threat"" because she questioned the excessive fee. And escorted is putting it lightly, as the Citywalk management forced her to walk over a mile in heels under the 101 while following her in a golf cart screaming ""keep walking"" to her. They blatantly put her life in danger in a flagrant abuse of power. Until my last dying breath I will make sure that no one I know will ever come back to this dump again. Also as we were leaving we saw a man get hit by one of their trams and the tram didn't even stop....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knoonen
20,Is this even an attraction?,"I mean, you pay $15 for parking and then you arrive at this street, full of restaurants and shops, but that's it. The shops are ordinary - Game Stop, Starbucks, AMC theaters... Not any different than going to a shopping center or something like it. Yes, it is a good street with nice eateries and nice shops, but no, this is not an ""attraction""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/50415
40,Lots to See & Do,"Interesting during the day & pretty at night, there's lots to see and do here. A great place to lunch away from the masses if spending the day at Universal Studios. Souvenirs galore: some cheap, some expensive, but always a bargain to be found (eg. LA hats for $2.50)Great birthday experience & food at the Hard Rock Cafe (daughter's choice) compared to others around the world!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4_Aussies_inOz
50,FUN AND SAFE FOR THE FAMILY,"We always ended our day here. Because we stayed at the Sheraton, a free shuttle service was provided. (although its not a very long walk anyway). We felt very safe here and the whole place just had a good atmosphere. We enjoyed a bit of shopping. There are plenty of restaurants and fast food outlets to keep everyone happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/micha1_9
50,Great ending to the day,"My wife and I had a great ending of our VIP experience at Universal Studios by checking out City walk. It was now dark, christmasy, so the lights were nice, the music was flowing, the stores were a plenty, the food was great and i went home satisfied. Definitely check this out at the end of the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cksteeve
50,NytLyts,"We brought our uncle who was visiting from east coast.

It was worth the drive despite the heavy traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bornok_30
50,So much to see and enjoy,"The CityWalk has so many different restaurants to choose from and they are all good. They also have lots of late night entertainment. Its a great place to take a date and eat dinner then go enjoy the bars, bowling, movies, and adult type arcades.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MoverShakerUSA
40,Only a place to spend money,"City walk at universal city Hollywood is nothing more than a shopping mall. Sure they film that 1 tv show on the plaza here but other than that, it's just stores and restaurants. If you're not going to the theme park itself, this could be skipped. Not much to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mymanimal

40,'Extra' Fun!,"We were visiting family for Thanksgiving and stayed at the Beverly Garland hotel. They provided a free shuttle service to Universal so we headed over late Wednesday morning for a look around. Upon entering we saw that the show Extra was filming. I was so excited because we weren't able to get into any show tapings due to the holiday. I could have watched that all day! But we did walk around, shopped, and ate. We were thinking about going into Universal park but tickets were $89 a person. Went back to catch the shuttle and we were able to see Mike Tyson arrive to the Extra set! Very cool. Don't think we would have gone if we had to pay to park, unless going to see a movie and getting parking validation. Would have liked to see it at night, too. Decorated so nice for Christmas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deezer1
40,Wonderful Evening,We went to Citywalk one evening after dinner and walked around. The Christmas decorations were incredible/the lights/the music. Following a little exploring we went to see the new Hunger Games at the movie theater (AMC Theaters)..not only is it an incredibly nice theater...but they will validate your parking and give you $8 back (we paid $10). So parking ended up being only $2. Definitely the way to go in order to save on parking. Highly recommend for a night out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/945JulieS945
30,$15 - just to park? Hell no.,I just wanted to pop in - eat at a restaurant and maybe buy something from a store but they wanted $15-$20 just to park? I understand the craze in paying for parking these days but seriously - $15? I am sure it is ok inside but no thanks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/walshyfamily
50,What's not to like?,"We have enjoyed this part or Universal City for a number of annual visits now and although it's a little dated here and there, I just love the vibe and atmosphere it gives. Night or day, there's always a fun place to eat and our girls will spend over an hour in Hot Topic alone. We probably spend more money here in one day than Universal Studios in three. I just wish they would funk up the place a bit more for the seasons. Halloween was a little deflated this year and I'm not confident the budget is there for Christmas either. Hopefully, they will inject some funding to keep this wonderful place ahead of the trends, because it really oozes appeal when the crowds are strong and the music is blaring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aussiedisney
30,Just OK....,To be honest I was expecting more...I think is a little bit old and dirty...some for the people on the stores are really rude or bored...I don't know...I went on Xmas ans supposedly it should be a happy time but I think It was kind of boring...maybe another season is better to visit ?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaPrince70
40,Buzzy atmosphere,"A good mix of shops and places to eat, mixed in with a dollop of atmosphere that you don't get in most places. Needed a bit of TLC in places, but notices round and about indicated that some sprucing up was going to be carried out. A good place to spend a few hours in a fun location.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH222
50,Shopping entertainment and good food,"Really what more could you ask, City walk has some amazing sights and pictures, excellent restaurants some high end purchases and tons of universal swag. Fav store on city walk had to be dark horse comics!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NoelleShivak
50,Nice time & shopping!,Nice food and shopping in City Walk! Enjoyed watching the Ifly experience even though I did not try this myself. It was fun to watch the others doing it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommylovin2
40,Great food at CityWalk,"The Universal CityWalk is great for a day trip on its own. The food options are excellent. In the one last trip we ate at karl Strauss, Tony Roma's and a 12:30am burger and beer at Johnny Rockets. Everything you want. The shopping is mediocre, some fun stores like the candy store, and a great 'magnet' store which was excellent for a collector such as myself. I would like to see more places like a LEGO store, and perhaps a great book and music store - if those even exist anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmT2538FV
40,A Blast!!,"A bit touristy, but we had a blast walking around and exploring the various unique shops. While we were there we also enjoyed live music from various street performers. There were also several great places to stop and grab a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/415crystalc
50,Amazing,It was great. one of our things that we like most was when our daughter did the Ifly. she had a ball and was great fun to watch her enjoy her 4mins of flying. An experience she will always remember.. The shopping for souvenirs was great there as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolyng967
30,Good tourist strolling and restaurants,Good people watching opportunities and some good restaurants to choose from when you are hungry. Walkable from metro and offers parking. We walked from nearby hotel property - Sheraton Universal.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sharalDc
50,Always good,"Lots of walking in this City area with great restaurants and unique shops. Lots of good times. We were a day early for the Halloween haunts, but that should be great too. We did not go into the park - just did the City walk and ate at Pink's located there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaneD306
30,Many shops here...,This is just a place to go if you get bored of the rides in the theme park and need to grab a snack or maybe buy some souvenirs. They have an outlet of the famous Pink's Hot Dogs which is definitely a must try! Nothing terribly special about this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjoelseow
40,Nice way to spend some time,We spent a few hours at Universal City Walk on a recent trip to Los Angeles. There were plenty of restaurant choices and shops to check out and every employee we encountered was really friendly. It wasn't overly crowded and the other guests all seemed relaxed. This is a nice place to stop if you want to check out some touristy shops and do some people watching. It kind of reminded me of Pier 39 in San Francisco minus the water. I would come back. There was no charge to get in other than the parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/desal
20,I had a much bigger expectations,"Nothing much to see. The same as it was 10 years ago, even less now.You can take a walk, eat something, And that is it.From Hollywood production I had bigger expectation in entertainment",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/agnezas
30,Universal City Walk,Had lunch at the Italian Restaurant - was very good.It was very crowded the day we were there but other than that it was worth the walk around City Walk.Worth going to see this part of Universal if you are going to Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987billp
50,Great Time,We came to Universal and didn't have alot of time. We bought the front access which really helped as we didn't have to wait in line as long. We had a blast and rode all the rides. The kids and adults had a great time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trippm277

40,Awesome place to spend time,"I was in California for 7 days and I went to this place everyday. Awesome place. Love it.There was entertainment all around. At the place you can shop, eat, and be entertained. Whom ever came up with this idea......its a hit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61channingf
50,Good mix,"Great mix of stores and food places for the family. More stores had good deals to choose from and we ate at Tony Roma's and it was very good, fast and excellent food. Go and enjoy yourself here after the craziness that is Universal Studios!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottFtMcM
30,An Interesting Bonus on a day to Universal Studios Park.,"Let me start by saying this isnt a destination or attraction. Its just a city block surrounded by parking garages for Universal Studios. I would never DELIBERATELY go here. Its just a place to dine or take in a comedy club after a day at Universal Studios park. Prices are a little bit over what you are getting in value, but theyve already gouged you $15 to park for Universal so you might as well make a day of it.You can even take in a move at the theatre, and Im guessing they never sell out. There are several live club venues. The neon makes it feel like little Las Vegas at night. Its electric. There are a few over priced souvineer shops. Same junk you get elsewhere at 1/3 of the price.I prefer eating here than in the park itself. You pay more here but always can get seating and don't have to wait an hour. The food quality is always better than at the park stands.Once you've been here it seems underwhelming on repeat visits.If you found something in here helpful please click helpful below. Godspeed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saskheat
40,Great Family Escape,Lots of attraction especially for kids. Hilton hotel is right next to it. Many attractions for adults too and this place is not as expensive like Disneyland but still enjoy yourself.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TarsierReviews
40,Great for people watching ...,"Remember ...its not crowded ...you ARE the crowd .Grab a coffee and a seat some where .Watch the people go by .It truly is entertaining .Remember to keep your comments to a whisper ...that guy with the gang tattoos isn't an extra from "" Training day ""..he might take exception to your giggles about his white socks and flip flops .The stores / restaurants /sights are a great way to spend an evening .Enjoy .I did",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomchuck19
50,"Great place to walk around with family, friends, first date or significant other.","Universal CityWalk Hollywood has an upbeat and fun atmosphere. There's a shop for everyone. Lots of entertainment and places to dine as well. My friends and I have enjoyed this place so much that we have visited on multiple occasions. There is no fee to enter, but there is a fee for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ele_denver
30,Great Atmoshphere,"It seems like there are more people walking along CityWalk than inside Universal Studios. Citywalk features lots of restaurants and shopping. Restaurants ranges from fancy to casual to fast food; there is a little something for everyone. During the summer, It also seems like there is a small concert that is hosted right by the theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leep116
50,Lots to do,We spent about a couple of hours here and could have stayed for the whole day. There are a lot of things to do and see. We didn't realize there was so much to do here. We planned on spending the day at Universal theme park but this place took up a couple of hours of our time. Plan on being here a while to check stuff out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jcrumley045
40,Love it,Lots of restaurants and shopping. Concerts and events all the time. Fun decor and over the top design. Mostly small chain stores like Bubba Gump. Everything is themed and flashy. Adults and kids have stores to go to and places to eat. Not just for the people coming out from Universal Studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelhR4757OG
40,Lots of shops and Restaurants! Great atmosphere.,"We came here twice - Once after our day at Universal Studios and again one evening just to look around and get something to eat!I personally thought the atmosphere was brilliant. Everyone there is happy, full of families and children having spent the day at Universal Studios and its such a vibrant, colourful place with tonnes of quirky shops and restaurants.There's a food court if you want some fast cheap food, but also a big selection of restaurants. We ate at a Mexican one night which was good, and well worth the money.There is also a cinema there which we visited, and heard that you get discounted parking if you buy cinema tickets. We used public transport (metro) which drops you off at the Universal City stop and then you jump on the free shuttle which takes you up the hill to the City walk and Universal.There is also a big open stage there, with free concerts and shows throughout the Summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krystinaf
40,Don't be surprised if you find yourself at CityWalk,"CityWalk is one of those places that is the perfect storm or quirk and recycled tourist shops and big franchise restaurants, but done right, or at least to the best of what I've sen in Los Angeles. Whenever there are visitors to LA, they are pulled to City walk like moths to a flame as its the one place where there is always something happening and is connected to a theme park.Unlike Downtown Disney, this is a more adult space and has plenty of comedy clubs, bars and restaurants that it boasts and in a much more accessible location and no trams required to visit.After visiting it multiple times I find that its a good place to take visitors and a place they might want to go as all the stores and shops can keep them busy for a few hours and then add on dinner and maybe a drink and they've fulfilled the tourists credo of trinket shopping, food in multiple forms and a drink.If thats not enough there is always some promotion going on during the weekends, definitely go at night an there will be a concert or at the very least you can always catch a movie at the theater.Parking minimum is $10, free before 5pm in subsequent visits if you get the appropriate Universal Studios Year Pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Roaming_Raven
40,City Walk,There are a lot of shops and resturants. If you go to the movies they will discount your parking. There are shuttles to the bottom of the hill.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markp0298
30,Universal/City Walk,"We strolled the City Walk after our Universal experience. There are loads of shops, some funky, some quirky, others overpriced and expensive. Some nifty 'different' attractions like the Indoor Skydiving kiosk...it's see-through so you can join in the fun even though you are a spectator.We arrived early evening and there wasn't much happening but apparently they have festivals, open-air productions and 'live shows'. The neon signs and lights were just coming on as we weaved our weary bodies back to the car and it looked like it might turn into a fun place once the lights went on. We were out of there though... it's a definite for an evening visit, next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KerryC604
30,Entertaining,"Suggested by the Concierge to come here, is was pretty entertaining nothing to be crazy about. Couple little niche shopping places, and stores, and basic restaurants. Hit or miss i guest for some.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/319melaniec
50,Great time at City Walk...,While visiting Hollywood recently our family decided to go over and check out City Walk and had a great time there. Tons of cool stores and restaurants to choose from. We had a great time shopping and walking around the complex... even though we didn't visit the park CW made for a great day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R8DERMAN
40,BETTER AT NIGHT,"After spent the whole day at Unversal studios, that was absolutely interesting,we just spent about half hour walking at CityWalk to see the cafe, Restaurants and souvenir-shops.I think is better at night with the coloured lights on, and to have dinner there, but we felt tired as we were there from 9 oclock in the morning.The other option is to have your coffee at Rock cafe or at Starbucks if you are fun like me.In a way you will feel like to be in an pleasant Luna Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AthinaT_13
20,Nothing special,"Don't plan a trip here - it's okay if you're planning to spend the day at Universal Studios anyway, but it's not worth an extra trip. Pretty to look at, some restaurants and interesting shops, but nothing exceptional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TanyaR697
40,Nice time,Have been to CityWalk Orlando numerous times so figured we would check out this location while in area. Definitely a much easier walk from parking garage than Orlando which was nice and it had a lot of good locations to eat and plenty of shopping. Nice way to spend a few hours to end your day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simbadusty
50,Fun,There are so many cute and entertaining stores here like the Pez store and many other things. Great place to have dinner at the end of the night I just wish I would have been here during a live event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SophieA132
20,Disappointing,"We went there for lunch. There was no clear indication of parking, so we ended up in line for parking to the main entrance. When we asked the attendant, he told us about the City Walk parking, so we had to exit and start again. City Walk was disappointing. A few shops and several restaurants, but nothing to get excited about for sure. The Grove and Americana are much more impressive. Perhaps at night it is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillS419
30,A Mall?,"Located right outside of Universal Studios, its a nice place to walk around. Not much shopping to be a mall, lots of food options, and nice to have outside the park so you don't feel the need to eat 'park food' for every meal. Parking is a little steep for what it is, but parking in LA isn't easy or cheap. Big movie theatre which looked nice, good choice for an upscale dinner and a movie.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/290DavidK
40,Good way to end a great day,"After a hectic day in Universal this was a great way to end the day.We shopped in the great variety of shops and headed to the cinema and then for a meal. Again a huge variety to choose from.As the sun set the lights came on, which was certainly worth seeing.Be aware that when we went (April) the restaurants closed fairly early so check timings. By the time we left, about 9.15pm, the place was pretty empty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsgm1310
30,"Rip off, but had to walk through on the way to universal studios","Looks very pretty but it's nothing more than a disguise for high high prices for not very inspiring food, and not a long walk. Ok if your going to universal studios but don't make a special trip - it costs $15 just to park which is ok if your planning to spend the day at the park, not so much if your just going for the city walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesscoombs91
30,See it at Night,Lots of stores and places to eat. Gibson Theatre is on Citiwalk. Had a nice time people watching. Cross the bridge to get to the hotels and you will see a nice view of LA at night. Better to go at night - more people. more activity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeLoveTraveling23
30,Kinda boring.,Feels more like an outdoor mall. Has a glitzy food court feel. More for teens and not much for mature patrons. Not one quality restaurant. I was disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamswanson

40,Bring your wallet,"The city walk is a great place filled with lots of shops and resturants.The movie theater is more expensive than Amc down street at 15$ a person matinee.Parking is high also 204 ,but you can park down hill and take free shuttle bus.If you don't like crowds go during weekday ,on weekends the locals venture here and its crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsc2678

50,Great Walk after a Day in Universal,"We didn't plan to go there, but after spent a day in Universal. We were tried to think what a eat for dinner. So we walk into the CityWalk. That was around 5pm, but many people there, but the shops and restaurants were busy. We took a slow walk thru it, all the neon lights shine in the street. I don't feel the dusk, i thought that was still in the day. The music is pumping in the center of Citywalk. Big screen showing Gangnam Style and some people just follow it the dance with. It was fun. Perhaps, you may grab a drink from Jumba or Starbucks wit walk along. Or whenever you feel hungry, just stop where you at, there must be a restaurant right next to you! ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
30,Crowded CityWalk,"We didn't visit CityWalk to see CityWalk, we just happened upon it when trying to visit a restaurant. Which means, we were not expecting this! There is definitely action on CityWalk, lots of restaurants, bars, and shops. But, it's not what we were seeking for our visit. We didn't spend much time there, but beware, you have to park in the Universal Studios parking garage, which is across the street and a crowded hallway away. I probably wouldn't go back here unless I was visiting Universal Studios.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheerfultraveler41
50,nice place to visit,lots of fun activities in this complex in the heart of LA. Nice shops and movie theaters and places to eat Universal studios is next door,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/147richards
50,Everything in one place!,"Okay, so I don't go on rides at my age but I enjoy seeing the sights, eating, games and movies. We stayed at the Sheraton Universal Hotel which is a 10 min walk or a free shuttle ride to the attraction. The food there is so good whether you go for hot wings, hot dogs or fine dining. We saw ""Olympus Has Fallen"" while there at the AMC theatre. There are many gift shops. They also have a simulated sky dive attraction that I liked though I did not get a chance to try out. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sbrown2620

Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikaI_12
30,I'm not sure it's worth the trouble to get there...,"LA is the perfect place for anything outdoors/open air, because it's pretty much perfect weather-wise, all the time. Universal's CityWalk is another great example of a good place to spend a few hours walking around, seeing things, and probably spending money. There's a decent selection of shops and food, a theater, and plenty of interesting things to look at. All that being said, I was so irritated by the experience of getting there, that it only balances out to so-so. Figuring out where to park was crazy. Paying as much to park as we did was kind of nuts (if I can valet in Malibu for less than I pay to self-park here, that just seems wrong.) the parking garage is a nightmare and once you figure out how to get into CityWalk from there, you know of don't even want to go anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chel-belle

40,Great experience at absolutely no cost,"Went to City Walk on a Friday afternoon, it wasn't crowded at all. Perhaps it was due to the slight drizzle prior to that. But I loved the place, it was well decorated and the atmosphere just like being in a theme park but without the rides. Great visit, even if you weren't planning on going into Universal Studios Hollywood.It is also convenient to get there; free shuttle service from LA Metro Station ""Universal City"". Get off the metro, cross the road and wait at the bus stop. The wait is not long; the frequency quite high.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xeno_13

50,Great day!,"We were excited about Universal Studios, but the parking garage opened onto CityWalk and we ended up browsing there for three hours.

30,If you don't mind the crowds...,"If you don't mind the crowds and the hassle with parking (even the valet is a little bit of hassle) then you may like this artificial city center. There is plenty of opportunities for half decent and a little bit overpriced food. There is an overwhelmingly huge movie theater with 100 screens (well, maybe not 100 but certainly around 20) and an ice ring in the winter. The biggest attraction, especially for little kids, is the water-fountain-walk which to the delight of children and some adults sprouts water geysers in unpredictable intervals and there is a few wet looking giggling kids around. OK place to take your out-of-town visitors to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mozo4ever

50,There's more to do outside of Universal Studios..,"So much else to see and do outside of Universal Studios. Lots of retail shopping and loads of restaurants/places to eat. In fact, so much to choose from, I had a hard time deciding where to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pixie16
50,Love this place,A great place to wander around and people watch. The shops are fun (but can be expensive) but the overall ambiance is great. Loved the micro brewery!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docsov
10,Misery,"Oh Universal Citywalk. You are the worst.Bad pop music played at ear-splitting levels, flashing billboards, chain stores, awful fast food restaurants, and thick crowds. This place is a waking nightmare. And parking costs an arm and a leg, and another leg... just for General as well. VIP Parking costs even more, which puts you marginally closer to the front entrance... if you pay for VIP Parking, you are essentially paying a moron tax. It's possible to park for free outside of the place, but you have to walk up a pretty steep hill, traverse over a buzzing freeway, and cross an intersection where people are driving pretty fast. So you're either paying a lot of money or putting yourself through a decent amount of inconvenience to visit a terrible, terrible place. The only time I am ever there is to see an IMAX movie, see a show at the Gibson, or visit the theme park. Otherwise, there is no good reason to visit. You can get Pink's Hot Dogs on La Brea.Life's too short. Avoid CityWalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethG527
50,Don't miss this,"After a day inside US, it is easy to spend another hour or two hitting the shops of CityWalk. A good range of shops selling food, fashion and souvenirs. Come nightfall the lights take over and it is a real fn place to be. You ant miss king kong! There is also a cinema here for parents who want to send their kids into the park for the day and the parents take in a movie :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NathaenM
30,It's Free!,"Great for people watching, plenty of pricey stores and restaurants. Just watching the Fly Away Skydiving customers was fun. It is much prettier at night, it is a good time passer waiting for a concert as well. Parking charge applies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrynkathy
40,If you're in the area stop by.,"This was right by our hotel so we went here a few times, it's very very bright and loud and exactly what we thought it would be, grabbed a burger and a beer there a couple of nights and people watched basically. There are a few shops but they're not great value for money as I imagine their overheads for the location are ridiculous.It's the usual mix of touristy gifts and tatt and clubs. Good place to grab a drink and a bite to eat after visiting universal definitely!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tobymono
40,Had a season pass 2011.,"I enjoy the variety of restaurants, Americana, Mexican, Sushi, BBQ and more. Some fun shops as well. Cool sports souvenirs and comic collectors stores. Stay away on Saturday nights unless you enjoy elbow room only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erik4Travel
50,Fun place. Feels like Las Vegas and Times Square,"Great job making it special. Of course it's just a way for retail and restaurant chains to make some money off the traffic in and out of the park but they did a good job of preserving the ""magic"" feeling of a theme park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenetha65
50,Good place for spending an evening,"We spent 3 hours there and it felt like a moment. There are many shops to buy souvenirs from Hollywood, clothes, eating spots etc. There were many people performing dance etc and it was fun to see them. We also loved the Christmas tree decorations there. Luv to visit again...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amitkgarg
40,Many great places to eat here!,I love Citywalk most for all the great places to eat. There are several great restaurants as well as smaller fast food type places. Camacho's has great Mexican food and is nice for a family celebration. There is also bowling and the movie theaters here plus shopping so there is plenty to do.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
20,Family fun,Tourists love this place and there are special things like winter ice rink and the movies and theme restaurants. Locals tend to avoid this place but it is so much more convenient than Disneyland and the kids will be thrilled (unless you raised them in Beverly Hills).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benjamins427

50,Go At Night,"I'm not very big on attractions that you walk around or go into shops, but CityWalk is an exception. The atmosphere even when crowded (which it usually is) is contagious. If you go to the Park make sure you visit the Walk afterwards. Parking is convenient and reasonable. The is no charge if you don't enter the park. It has been awhile (I used the earliest date below) since I was there (visited 3 times) but it is probably even better than ever,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChuckR9999
40,Lots of restaurants and shops,"We collect Hard Rock Cafe pins so we stopped here on our latest trip to L.A. It was a bustling place with lots of tourists. There are loads of restaurants and all sorts of shops along with a movie theater. It was a fun place to walk around for a bit and to explore the shops and people watch. It's not a must do, but it's not a bad place to stop by. It's connected to the Curious George parking deck so you don't have to walk far to get to it. It was all decorated for Christmas and they did a great job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keg198
30,There's not much to do here.,We enjoyed the theater. We watched a Disney movie. LOLThere was a comic shop in the area but it's just overpriced junk for tourists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smartlabelprint
40,Fun Family atmosphere and IMAX,A great all day thing to do. The Citywalk is a hollywood themed main street that leads you up to Universal Studios. There is a huge movie theatre there with an IMAX theatre always showing something cool. Lot's of great food options of all levels and decent shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
50,A great Walk,This is really a fun place to be. Really kind of exciting with loud music and people all over the place just walkiing around. Many many shops to go into and lots of food places where you can get lots of variety. There is a big concert hall up there and also a place to go to the movies with many movies being shown. Everything from Hard Rock Cafe up there to great Restuarants. A little cool at night with the wind but its fun to be there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddyone1
30,Nothing special,Ok so it's in universal but is it really worth it's own Trip Advisor 'attraction'? I don't think so. No better than any shopping mall. It's fine but nothing special.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon617
30,What a walk up! :-),A nice place to visit. In the fall closes at 9 pm. If you walk from the transit or parking wear your walking shoes. It is a a 10 minute hike straight up. Be in shape. At night a nice view of Studio City. Nice shops and stores and restaurants. The Mexican restaurant looks very ethnic until you get your food. Everything is processed- even the chicken :-(. At least one place for everyone to go into I hope. I went to the food area about an hour before closing so there was no charge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justjoe2

30,Loud and expensive!,"We was staying at the Hilton Universal City as we thought it would be a good base to stay whilst we was in Hollywood and due to its close location to the Universal CityWalk, CityWalk was just ok though we thought it lacked in atmosphere and thought the restaurants was charging more because there isnt anything else to do in the area, Every restaurant seemed to charge an extra $5-10 because they were based in CityWalk, Also everywhere seemed to have blasting music coming from everywhere which was quite unpleasant, So we decided to leave and find a restaurant in Burbank which was much better! There seems to be alot to do at CityWalk though with the multiplex cinema and some great shops and a great Starbucks which is a great start to the day if youre heading into Universal Studios!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orlandouk
20,Times Square in LA - but not as good,"Went after leaving Universal Studios at the end of the day so was mobbed. Lots of shops, not a lot cheap, and the food all seemed overpriced.OK for a wee wander just to see it but not great for much more unless you want to pay over the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SMTID
50,Fun place to hang for a few hours at night,"We go here occasionally. What we like about Universal CityWalk is that it's a friendly ""themepark"" environment. Lots of fun shops, some good restaurants, nice theatre etc. Only bummer is the extra $15 parking everytime. But for a nice stroll and some fun, it's highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdeenen
20,For those from the sticks,"A phoney ""Hollywood"" experience...crowded, nothing real. Not my thing.

40,The City Walk,"Crowded, loud and lots of over priced stores. However, I know this is a tourst destination (AKA Tourst Trap) so it is exactly what I expected. It was a fun place to walk around and people watch. Also there are a lot of places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobW686

50,Lively,"Live music or shows on the stage were good, although we had to sit outside to eat in 1of the restaurants and we couldn't hear each other speak. I think the restaurant was called Panda Express, it was delicious. We also ate at the Steakhouse, no words can discribe that meal. but BIG will definitely discribe the portion you get. and not forgetting the dessert you get free, a big what looks like a cocktail glass of Candyfloss, omgSome good shops although not alot, there is more places to eat and drink than shop, Sketchers is great, had a sale the day we went with extra money off scratch cards. Which is what everyone likes to hear in these times. MONEY OFFIts right next to Universal so when Universal closes you've not far to walk to get a nice big meal after walking around the park all day, and for those of you with ticky tummys who probably threw up breakfast lolBut no an amazing day out in the park finished of by a great night watching a show or just having a great meal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SiobhanB560
50,Good mix of shops with a great atmosphere,"This group of shops is a great foil to Universal Studios, albeit at a slightly higher cost. The best thing about the area is the atmosphere, with good music throughout the venue, with a few very good places to eat. Well worth a few minutes before or after the theme park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockkevin6

10,Rip off,"We went to Disneyland downtown last night and really enjoyed the atmosphere etc so thought we would visit the universal version today. We didn't even get past the car park entrance. Universal expect you to pay $15 to spend money with them, I asked the attendant if she was joking as we only wanted to visit the city walk, she told you no so we u turned out of the place, I was absolutely disgusted!Disney downtown has 3 hours free parking and longer if you eat there, in Florida! Disney is always the most obscene prices but obviously Universal is going for the LA title.At least Dick Turpin wears a mask.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissEmma1985

40,"Plenty to see, do, eat and shop","Free to enter this was only a short walk away from our hotel.We went up each night to grab some food and also visit the IMAX cinema. It has a really good atmosphere at night, there was always plenty of people there and with the flashing lights and music it felt like a party.We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe, Mexican Cantina, Italian and a little hotdog place and all were good, but the Itailian was the best, great food and service.There is a good mix of shops too and I managed to get most of my sovenier shopping done here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missemilyshaw
40,A super tourist attraction,While I wouldn't go here on a regular basis this is a great place to go when visiting. Most restaurants are pretty good and it's the perfect place to people watch. There are tons of activities too but at a cost.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanelleT60
50,So much to do..so little time,"This is a great place to hang out! I know it's touristy, but it's a lot of fun as well. There are tons of dining choices and great places to take pictures all around CityWalk. If you can't decide on one of the restaurants there's also a pretty nice food court upstairs here. I particularly enjoy the multi screen AMC theater here. We went to see the new Batman movie in IMAX and had a blast. The seats are extremely comfortable in the theater. There's live music to be found throughout CityWalk and you can never beat ""people watching"" if you can't decide what else to do. Be on the lookout for celebrities who frequent CityWalk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity

50,Best Part of Universal,"Best part of Universal and that is saying something! I really feel like Universal tries to give you that big city vibe! Although the property is a decently confined area they do an alright job. It's mostly about the idea of what your doing rather than the actual experience. City walk had stores for the majority of the consumers. I found my self getting Taco Bell and sitting in front of the Humongous TV screen. They played music videos to popular new artists like Nicki Minaj, Rihannam and so on. It wasn't really my style but they did an alright job pulling it together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecatwhotravels
30,It's allright,"Food. Shopping. Really it's just a tourist trap outdoor mall with lots of lights. Beware, you have to pay for parking here. The AMC Theater is good and has a real IMAX inside. Defenatly a good place to people watch but don't make this a destination unless you are going to Universal Studios anyways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Popko1
40,outside shopping action,"it's just a different feel than walking down let's say sunset or hollywood blvd. all in one location, shops, eateries, sweets, movie theatre, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heidisb
30,Universally Boring,"Went to City Walk in May as we hadn't been there in a while. There are a few cool things to look at, like the iFly store, where you can fly in a wind tunnel, but overall the stores are lackluster and sell souvenirs that you can find in Hollywood by the dozen for less. It seems like as of late more and more vendors have found a place to sell annoying flashing guns that make horrendous noise and shoot water. It's like the toy district, and Indoor Valley Swap Meet found a permanent home here. There's nothing that is exciting or OMG WOW to look at, besides the ginormous Marilyn Monroe statue made of candy selling for a million dollars or something. Well maybe less.To me, Universal CityWalk Hollywood, feels like "" Hoarders, Famous Landmarks: Mall Edition "" Nothing goes and it's just piles and piles of stuff that doesn't make sense, or should be tossed out.For example, do we really need a Guess store here? Or is it absolutely necessary to have a Hot Topic store with blaring techno music that will make your ears bleed upon entering?You can also go to luxury bath store, Lush to get your soap on, or the comic book store that sells the same action figures as Target.To me it feels like UCWH is stuck in the 90s and doesn't want to let go. Don't believe me? Well you can think about it while eating fried buckets of sea water at Bubba Gumps. There's also a Gladstone's and some other Mexican restaurant, which escapes my memory at the time.I don't get what this is supposed to be, there are nightspots like Howl at the Moon, and there's a comedy club there as well, and a Saddleback Ranch so it seems like this is more geared to bring in a adults, that like to drink and ride mechanical bulls.This place is in dire need of a revamp. People don't want to go to the Guess store, or Hot Topic.I was bored. I can go down to Hollywood, pay $5 for parking, buy cheaper souvenirs, have better food, and be more entertained, or I can go to the mall, park for free and enjoy a pretzel and buy some soap.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GypsyGrl77
30,expensive,"fun to see, good restaurants, a good one time visit kinda place...I thought it was very expensive..even for LA, will probably not go back unless a visiting friend wishes to go. You are better off going into Hollywood (about 10 minutes away)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteH951
40,Good stop if not going into Universal Studio,"The good:1) Lots of food choices & shopping available. That means plenty to do for the whole family.2) Easy access from metro - get off the metro, then walk to the shuttle stop for the free shuttle (running until midnight in summer)3) Good vibe, and gives you the chance to take a photo at the Universal Studio globe.The bad:1) Not much I can think of - I guess if you drive to this place, then it can get congested.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mozilla_monster
40,Can eat and shop here!,"Stayed one night at Hilton on way from San Fran to Palm Springs. Instead of going to Universal Studios my two teenagers were fine with shopping, eating and doing iFly. Lots of food selections. Ate at Tony Romas which was predictable but good. Kids loved shopping at Hot Topic and It's Sugar. It poured rain briefly. There are no places to escape rain except inside stores or restaurants. Would recommend eating here and not at hotel. It's a short walk and much more variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soymoosemom

There are also some niche stores like ""Things from Another World"" (comic geeks rejoice!) and the candy store ""It's Sugar"" that add a bit to the casual shopping options. One of the corners is flanked by the entrance to the Universal Studios.

Ok, here's the rub,,,,,, you pay $10 for parking, then to get inside where there is nothing but more commercial establishments to spend even more money. Its a giant sized carnival with all the blinking lights, shows and restaurants. Much more interesting to the younger crowd for date cruising, older folk may find it tiresome.

40,Nice place to spend an afternoon,"It's a bit of a trip, if you're coming by Metro. Once you get to the station, you'll find you need to catch a Universal bus up to the CityWalk. The walk isn't doable, because if I recall right, the street you go up to get to it has no sidewalks. So you may have to wait a bit for the bus, but it's worth the wait.Nice place to window shop and get some lunch. Really enjoyed the Cinnabon place here, but then again it'd been a long time since I had one of those lovely things. The iFly looks awesome, and maybe next time I visit, if it's still there, I'd like to try it. Just a nice place to stroll wander through and enjoy the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MukuSix

Go to Pasadena or 3rd Street instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anadamansea

We were staying at the Hilton over the road so it was super convenient for us.No complaints but very crowded and full of tourists like me wandering around looking at everything and getting in the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Avianfluman

40,"Great fun, but only briefly","I love Universal Studios. I love Citywalk but definately make it part of your trip to Universal Studios or combine your day with a movie and dinner. Its a destination and is most enjoyed when you have an agenda. Hit up the restaurants, go to a movie. The shops are all fun and brightly lit at night. Some are standard Mall stores. Enjoy the uniqueness of the few others but overall go for the energy. It costs to park. It can be 25% of your visit if you are just a couple. I dont mind walking so I park down the hill and pay a few bucks in the meter. Its a steep hill but it adds to the fun.Great fun, more so after you spend the day in the park and visit at night!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
40,A Flashy sight-sound experience for free!,"Put these same stores in another setting, and you would have a regular kind of open-air mall. But this place has enough sizzle to make it unique, especially after dark. CityWalk also brings in some of the best street artists & musicians, with some live bands on a stage in a large open area. Even the 'Muzak' is high-quality audio throughout the venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RalphK507
50,So many things to do and see!,"So after you close the park down, have som more fun at Universal CityWalk! You can shop, eat eat eat, catch a movie, do this skydive thing (I'm gonna do it next time), or just people watch. We danced at the center. OK, so they can a DJ to liven up the place and even perfomer, it's a lot of fun! I'll def return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChikaLadybug
50,Excellent atmosphere,"Great place to visit any time day until early morning. Wherever you visit, or just walking in the open at city walk you get a great feeling and you just love being there. The atmosphere is amazing, everyone is friendly and there is always some sort of street entertainment to watch. The larger than life tv screen playing music videos make a great difference. Plenty of restaurants to choose from, something for everyone. Visit yoghurt land as the frozen yoghurt is addictive with so many flavours to choose from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/206trish

20,Tourist Central,"It's fun, don't get me wrong, but it definitely is a tourist trap. Decide for yourself if it's for you. I personally don't go here often, but every time I'm there I do see lots of other people having fun.They charge WAY too much for parking. If you don't want to pay, you have to park at the bottom of the hill and walk all the way up -- about a fifteen-minute uphill hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/596aarong

The mix of unique shopping and dinning and neon lights it felt like the shopping area of some of the Las Vegas hotels.We came here on the 6th night in LA, and we did most of our shopping here. The Sweet Shop, and Sock Shop and Travel shops all had fun things, I wish we had these stores back in Chicago. The close proximity made it easy to walk around and enjoy. There is definately enough food options to keep everyone with you happy. The large screen with the music video's and all the lights gave it a very swanky fun feel.I would say this is a must!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel4Fun31
50,Shops and Food,There are some lovely shops here for souvenirs and something nice to treat yourself. The food at the Hard Rock Cafe was great. Staff in shops were very friendly.

20,so-so,So easy to get lost. It's Disneyland for Mexicali. You will feel out of place unless you are fourteen and on a date or have gang tatoos. And the bars are very hootchie. Look out for eighteen year old military boys hitting on you. I remind them that I could be their mom.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orangeyellowdog
40,A great selection of shops and eateries to please,"Whether your a tourist or a local you can never go wrong coming to CityWalk. There are plenty of places to pick from for your dining choices and a huge array of shops to drop into. Although the offerings here cater to more of the tourist side, I still come here as a local to enjoy the movie theaters, dining and shops plus the ample parking structure always has enough spots open even when there's a huge amount of people there. Although during the tourist seasons it can get a little too crowded with people since the venue has a very narrow walking path for guests to explore through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdeenen_canada

We spent a few hours here after a day at Universal, It was really enjoyable. Bubba Gumps was great, has shops such as Hot Topic and a wide variety of stores. The only negative would be Starbucks it was crap purchased a croissant which had not butter or jam available just a dry old croissant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AarondQueensland
40,"Neat, Easy, and Cheap","Our family had a great time. $15 to park, and no other entrance costs. Unless of course, you actually go to Universal Studios. Shopping is cool. We went into a toy store and bought a cool frisbee for $5 and then ate at Johnny Rockets. 5 of us cost $52 with tip. Go during late afternoon, so you will be there at night. The lights are magical. Some cool street music performers and other ""interesting"" performers. Grab a starbucks later on, $22 for the 5 of us, and go people watch. And, we LOVED the candy store !! Fun night",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EnzoL394

We were there Dec. 30 and it was packed, but we waltzed right in, and if you eat there and have your ticket validated, all the cost was the tip only. The kids had a ball people watching, eating, shopping....there was something for everyone. The food options are typical ""desitnation type"" places, but overall, everything we ate was above average. Dinner at Tony Roma's, drinks at some place along the way, ice cream and donuts at another place. The DJ's are fun, current rap songs that all the kids know were blaring.

The shops were all neat and trendy but reasonably priced. I purchased souviners there to take back home. I also have to say it is very clean and family friendly. We tried two of the restaraunts, the hard rock and bubba gumps. Both were really good, but the food at the hard rock was my favorite.

My husband and I went with our 23 year old daughter and had a blast! It definitely is too scary for little kids,. In fact, I think they do have an age requirement. They have 3 admission prices: general, front of the line and premium. Definitely spring for the front of the line pass.

40,Fun to visit,I liked the large area by the food court where they had a DJ playing music and people dancing in the middle. A camera panned over the crowd and showed them on a large screen above. Lots to see a do. Parking was brutal though - we paid $15 for general parking and ended up parking on the top floor of the parkade. The good thing is that we found a spot right by the escalators that took us right into the food court.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missmattie
40,Tons of energy,After a long day at the park we walked up CityWalk. We stopped at the Zen store where my son got a water massage. He loved it.

40,Worth a look if you're in the area (adjacent to Universal City); query whether you would make a special trip...,"CityWalk is an outdoor mall of shops, cafes, bars, restaurants and cinemas, located adjacent to the Universal City Studios.If you've spent the day visiting Universal, then it's logical to pay a visit.Also, if you're in the area, you could stroll through here for an hour or so.However, to be realistic, this place doesn't really offer a unique proposition which makes it a ""must see"" attraction, although it's well enough done for what it is.The overall im[pression it conveys is that of a mall, albeit with several entertainment offerings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelaidiantraveller
50,"Glitzy, glamourous, spectacular, lots of fun!","As soon as I walked in, I immediately was exhilarated with the lights, music, and Times Square-esque atmosphere. There are numerous places to eat, no matter what kind of food you’re in the mood for. The shopping is out of this world, from Billabong to a sock market. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous, making you feel so much at home. For adults, there is a comedy club and a dance club for great night entertainment after a day at Universal Studios. During the summer of 2011, they have free concerts on a brand new stage starting at 8pm or so. The complex also has many family activities and stores, including a full 17-screen cinema and an IMAX. Whether you go to the adjacent theme park or not, plan to go to CityWalk! Everyone should have the opportunity to marvel in it and enjoy it.P.S. I have also been to the CityWalk in Orlando: it does not even compare with the one in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminOdom

40,Universal City Walk is fun to visit!,"My family, husband and two children ages 7 and 9, visited the Universal City walk 2 nights in a row in June 2006 when we were in LA to visit Universal Studios. We found the Universal City Walk, which consists of shops and resturants, a fun place to visit each night and eat dinner. There are many resturants to choose from, our favorite was Wolfgang Puck's. We enjoyed a pizza there that was one of the best we have ever had. We also had fun walking the mall enjoying the scenery from a giant Hulk coming out of a building, a huge guitar in front of Hard Rock Cafe, a car crashing into the roof of a store, and torches with fire. There are many shops to visit, from clothing, shoes, and sovenirs. All in all, this is an enjoyable place to eat dinner, and do some shopping in LA. We would definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmjh02

40,fun,"Whether it be the music, food, or shopping that's your favorite, there is something for everyone at Universal City Walk. My favorite wat the 80 ft. high guitar in front of the hard rock cafe. Even if you only have enough money for dessert the food at hard rock does not disappoint. If that's not your thing you can walk down to the sam goody superstore where a giant gorilla awaits you. This place is all the glamour of L.A without the high prices.",
