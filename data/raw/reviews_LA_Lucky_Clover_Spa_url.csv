50,"""Oh!!! I felt good""","I came here after feeling the need to have a foot massage. The place is nice and clean. Staff were all nice and friendly. I chose a foot massage since my feet were not feeling well. I had an hour massage (20 minutes shoulders/head massage and 40 minutes legs and feet massage). I like it because the place was soothing (music played congruent to the need to feel relaxed :-). My masseuse was very caring, asking me how hard the pressure I wanted for the massage. I appreciate that so much. I was offered water after my massage and they also accept credit cards. I will be back for a full massage. I think the fees are reasonable. Parking is in front of the place or on the side of the building.",annminky
50,wife loved this place,"My wife was due for a massage, so I decided to support a local business and got her a gift certificate for Lucky Clover in Sierra Madre.It was money well spent! My wife emerged from her hour massage radiating with tranquility and relaxation.She said that the person doing the massage was both attentive and thorough. I know some have had weird/sketchy experiences at Pasadena/SGV massage places, but this was not the case at Lucky Clover.My wife raved about Lucky Clover, and I plan to get her another gift certificate for a massage there soon.",CptCluster
40,Treat yourself!,"This place is super clean and appealing. I got an hour foot massage and left feeling so good. After 8 visits, you get a free service. If you are going for a foot massage, be sure to wear a short sleeve shirt (neck and arms also get some work) and loose pants, shorts or a skirt.",BeeBeeLosAngeles
