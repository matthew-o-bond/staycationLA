50,Gem in Pasadena,"Visit PMCA before this gem closes! I was quite impressed to see such diverse exhibits that ranged from early Calfornia to the miraculous gifts women's body in a small yet, lovely gallery. We were fortunate to enjoy lunch, a wine tasting, and stroll during our visit with free covered parking.",HilleryB21
40,Cool little museum,Decided to visit before the museum closes in October while visiting Pasadena. Really cool exhibit about childbirth done through multi media presentation. Garage with itâ€™s graffiti artwork was actually my fave (and provides free parking). Visit while you still can!,sazoram
50,"A FIRST CLASS MUSEUM, NOW CLOSING THIS FALL - A GREAT LOSS","PMCA is a first class museum, whose reach exceeds its grasp. A labor of love for its Directors, Curators, andabove all its Founders and Trustees. The shows by such California home artists as Corita Kent and Sam Francisboth set and established the bar of small museum excellence.Pasadena will soldier on with such pillars as The Norton Simon Museum and, adjacent to PMCA, ThePacific Asia Museum. But we are all diminished.",BULLDOG742014
50,Lovely Museum. Friendly Staff.,"This was my first time at this museum and I'm thrilled I now know about it. I visited because I wanted to see the Hollywood in Havana poster exhibit which is part of Pacific Standard Time, a large group of Latin shows in and around Los Angeles. It is a small exhibit, ending tomorrow and it was fun to see these graphic images. I was even luckier to stumble on their larger show, a retrospective of E Charlton Fortune's work. I was not familiar with her paintings and her body of work is so impressive. It's easy to get to this museum and the area blocks have free parking for one or 2 hours depending on which you find. The museum is on the second floor. Admission is $7 or for seniors $5. There is a lovely gift shop too. The staff was very friendly and helpful.",Nancy D
50,An escape for an hour of art!,"Free parking, wonderful art, changes often so you can keep visiting and always see something new. Wonderful gift shop that has a lot of the artists' books.",Dottie J

40,Very modern Art,"You must love the rotating exhibits at this museum. Very creative, ultramodern, concepts in California art. This is a place to go back to again and again, as I do, to see new creative ideas in art.",PilotMichael
50,Enjoyable and Relatable Art,This museum is not the biggest but it does have the biggest grip on what is going on with Art in California today. Many pertinent and youthful exhibitions come through here. They are bringing in some exciting stuff! It is worth the low entry and the time it takes to walk through.,deabs8
50,My favorite local museum,This place is great. I've been to several exhibitions there and they've all been really well-done. The museum isn't overwhelmingly large. You can expect to spend about an hour there depending on the size of the show.,122marthah
40,When in California...,"This small museum does not have a permanent collection but rather mounts periodic exhibitions (note that it is closed for two weeks while that process is taking place). We too enjoyed the Kleitsch (painting) and Baumann (print-making) exhibitions. Both artists studied in / worked in Chicago but were unknown to us although we live there.Because the museum is small, just three rooms one one floor, one can stroll through at a leisurely pace and not be overwhelmed. I would place this museum in that category of charming museums that one does not travel huge distances to see but thoroughly enjoys after doing the must-sees. Somewhat like the Musee de Cluny in comparison to the Louvre.And did I mention the welcome off street, shaded parking on a sunny July day?",Windy_City880
50,A great afternoon date,"A very reasonably priced museum for an extremely well-curated museum. I really loved the Kleitsch exhibit. If your looking for a cute afternoon activity, this is a great place to visit.",Mikey B
40,Nice small museum!,"This is an American art museum which is nice because often times art work we see are from Europe. It's small - two rooms but had a fun collection, particularly the standing art work and the art work made by pressing craved wood in the second room. I got a Groupon deal on this which made it even better!",itsxjackie
40,Visited to see the Gustav Baumann exhibit,"The exhibit was small, but informative. Enjoyed the other painting exhibit, but the sculpture exhibit was silly. The Kenny Scharf graffiti in the parking garage was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.",Marblehead750
40,An oasis of calm and cool in the heat,"Small but very well curated.Shop was a little disappointing - with very high end goods mostly, a little out of my price bracket. Would have liked to have seen more stuff related to the current exhibitions.The two museum staff in the galleries were a little annoying too... just lurking around staring at their phones. I can't think of other art galleries where this is allowed to happen... but it didn't really spoil the visit.If you're in Pasadena, pop in for an hour...",Emerson_Powell
50,Beautiful small museum/large gallery,"Small space, by most museum standards, this venue is more like one large gallery and one smaller attached gallery, but the focus on California art and artists from California makes the exhibits worth a part of any day. Cute little gift shop too.",Ray Q
50,Not Your Neighborhood Gallery,"The Pasadena Museum is a wonderful, small museum, hidden away on Union St. The exhibits change with frequency and are dedicated to celebrating California artists, exploring every genre.",Randall W
40,Interesting modern Art,"I have always found this museum to have very interesting modern Art. Truly modern, in every sense of unusual modern creative ideas. The property is interesting as well. I'm not sure how often the work rotates, however it's definitely worth your investigation to see what this museum has to offer.",PilotMichael
40,small but worthy of your time,Revolving installations keep it interesting. We saw a show on CA tile works and it was great! Lots of info and many items were made for Hearst Castle.,transplanted2016
40,Hidden Gem with California Art,Small museum with an interesting and beautiful display of California landscapes and people. Varied assortment of paintings of mostly ocean and beaches but also mountains and deserts and everything that makes California beautiful.,Susan90405
40,Great Small Modern,"Pasadena has a reputation for having been a place of the arts in the past. While this is true, Pasadena is STILL a culture emeshed in the arts, and this museum demonstrates that present living artistic culture.",Scott L
40,A small museum of high quality,"My wife and I spent a couple of very enjoyable hours at the PMCA when we visited last month. They had a very interesting retrospective of work by Claire Falkenstein, an artist whose work we were not familiar with. The museum had a wide selection of excellent works in a variety of media. It was very well presented, along with a video on her career. In a smaller gallery was a collection of photographs by Brett Weston. We plan to go back the next time we are in the LA area.",catonsviller

50,Way cool,A small place but very cool. Can do it in a couple of hours. Great rotating exhibits....this time on California tile. Pure California art...fun. Nice folks to answer questions. Nice shop,Arthur S
30,Probably depends on current exhibitions,"I like the idea of this museum, but I'll bet it depends totally on what the current exhibition is. There were two people in our party -- one liked the exhibition very much; me, not so much -- but that's just a matter of personal taste/preference. Not disappointing, but I think I expected more....",SPINDOCDENVER
50,Small But Special,"Love this place! It's a small museum devoted to California art. But while it's regional in nature with respect to its exhibits, the place covers everything from California Impressionistic paintings, contemporary sculptures, historical tile and pottery, contemporary art, wood block prints, and pretty much anything else artistic you can think of. There is no ""permanent"" exhibition, and so it survives with changing or travelling exhibitions. Check-out what's on display before you go, and likely you'll find something of interest. Also, if you can, hook up with a docent for a group tour of whatever is on display at the moment. ""Art comes alive"" when explained by someone knowledgeable.",TheBrasilian
50,A showcase of California art,"The Pasadena Museum of California Art does exactly what its name implies -- shows changing exhibitions of art by California artists or depicting the California landscape, both from the past and by contemporary artists. The gallery space is excellent and parking is convenient. It's just around the corner from the Pacific Asia Museum, so visits to the two museums can easily be combined.",Joseph H
50,California Art Treasure,"I love this place. In years gone by we used to go to jazz on the rooftop which overlooked the Pasadena City Hall, washed in lights. The museum is one which people may overlook and I suggest a visit.",Offthebeatenpath011
50,Museum with beautiful Parking ART,They has a free event for children in summer. I went to visit their summer programs for children. They have one of the best art classes every year and have great collections as well. Love their parking lot which is all painted by students with arts. Must check it out.,Cma P
50,Art Night Gem,Large spacious multi-level gallery. A good variety of installations and exhibited Art pieces. Good location adjacent to Pacific Asian Museum and Colorado Blvd. Restaurants are within walking distance making it a nice outing for the day. Great to take advantage on Pasadena Art Night.,845beatriz
50,great small museum in a great location,"When we visited, there was a retrospective of the works of Sister Corita who became Corita Kent. It was well organized and the curatorial explanations provided a good context for the development of her work which reflected the changes not only in her life, but in the generation strongly influenced by her art.We are from out of town and our Garmin got us there with no problem, but we had not known there was parking available in the building.This museum is close to both the Museum of Pacific Asian Art and the Cordon Bleu Culinary Arts restaurant. We enjoyed",laurelhurst56
50,Small museum of local California artists present and past,Love coming here! It's very small and you can probably see everything in an hour or less. It's constantly changing though so you can come every 3/4 months or so to see something new and at 7$ entry is very reasonably priced. No food available for purchase though.,Varesha108
40,A great find!,If you like modern and pop art then this a very good museum to check out. May be small but it's excellent museum. Definitely worth to check it out. They had the Corita Kent exhibit when I went.,TravelFoodDance
50,I love this little museum,"I've been to a number of exhibits here. Just saw Cortia Kent's and it was excellent. I really like the size of this museum. It's not very big and rarely crowded, perfect for a Sunday afternoon. My husband and I first went out to lunch and then went over to the museum.",pat q
40,Striking exhibitions of unusual art,"Like others we intended to couple our visit to this museum with one to the Pacific Asian Museum nearby but found that it was sufficiently diverting to warrant several hours by itself. I'd rate this second in the Pasadena area only to the Norton Simon Museum. The PMCA occupies the second and third floors of a building that also houses a ground floor parking garage decorated with artful graffiti. Three exhibitions took up the entire space and each had something to recommend it. The most unusual was a running video, filmed from different directions and projected on three screens. It depicted the artist's interpretation of everyday human behavior at a time of rising sea levels, reduced to the confines of a large water tank that filled and emptied periodically, exposing and then covering its human occupant. Some of the tableaux were of a male and a female writhing and spinning, sometimes clothed and sometimes naked, even occasionally exhausting body gases. Despite the avant garde-like striving I was more taken by the exhibition of Armin Hansen's marine scenes in an adjacent space. More than 50 canvases, some very large, decorated the walls and showed me the works of an artist never previously encountered. His portraits of working fishermen on the California coast were most engaging. The third exhibition ""Wounds of Existence"" reminded me of Francis Bacon's hung carcasses and not to the artist's advantage. These exhibitions will last for several months and, if they are any indication of the others that will presumably replace them, they suggest a programming philosophy that is worth watching in action. I'd certainly visit again.",Taughboyne
40,Great little museum with changing exhibits,"Check to see what is showing. It is usually current California artists, but not exclusively. Small. Small. An hour visit. Go to the Pacific Asia Museum nearby to make an afternoon of it.",Louise A
40,"If you like photos and modern art, you'll enjoy this museum.","It's worth an hour and the price of admission if you need something to do while in Pasadena. But, you might put the Norton Simon Museum higher on your list of Pasadena 'must-sees'.",vinojeff
40,Always Something Unusual,"This museum is on the semi-annual citywide tour ""Art Night"" when many of the museums are open free of charge. They have changing exhibits that are always unusual but interesting. Sometimes they have their roof-top space open with a nice view of the Pacific Asian Museum and the iconic Pasadena City Hall.",TerrywHamilton
40,Nice Museum,"We had a free afternoon.. It was so nice to spend it here. There were many nice pieces of art and if you do take the time, be sure to have plenty of time and do not rush. Take in the beauty of the art, it was breathtaking.",AngelMc1
40,Proud,"This museum makes me proud to be a Californian, home of such creativity. There are lots of states that could not host such a museum!",CarmichaelVentura
40,An hour of art,"I try my best to make it here for the free 3rd Thursday each month. On those days they are open in the evening which makes it easier for a local to get there after work.No matter which exhibit is up or artist's work is on display, there will be a point of inspiration and wonder that will capture you. I like the first room on the left which always has an unorthodox medium for its art.This is also a good stop during ArtNight Pasadena.",Dabanales
40,A great experience.,"We came here on one of the ""free"" Thursdays to see these two exhibits: June Wayne: Paintings, Prints, and TapestriesMay 4â€“August 31, 2014Time, Space & Matter:Five Installations Exploring Natural PhenomenaMay 4â€“August 31, 2014We were so impressed with the exhibits but also with this particular Museum. Sorry that we haven't been there before and will most definitely return to see other exhibits in the future. If you have time to come before these are over, do it. So interesting - both exhibits were impressive.",livasida

40,"Its a cliche, but yes this museum is a hidden gem","Albeit hiding in plain sight. We had meant to go to the Asia Pacific Museum, but in fact we decided to try this place where I hadnt been in about 9 years. The parking has the Kenny Scharf murals. The exhibition was on the artist Alfred Ramos Martinez, kind of a contemporary of Diego Rivera. I dont know if all exhibitions are this good, but this one blew me away. This artist is amazing. Maybe we lucked out. It would appear they dont have much of a permanent collection but this was a superbly curated show. Small gift shop, easy acccess, walkable. Highly recommend.",kimparklee
40,Small and Good,A museum worth visiting in Pasadena. Near the Pacific Asia Musem and small enough to do both in the same day.,Chris T
40,Always something to see and good bookshop,Highly recommend seeing the very complete Sam Francis painting exhibition. Excellent insight into his career and how he began painting while in a body cast for over 3 years! A 5 decade look at one of the most important California artists.,CayeBoy
30,Sam Francis : 5 decades of Abstract Expression,"10.11.13 Pasadena Art Night, most of the local museum have open house from 6-10pm.We headed for Pasadena Museum of California Art first to check out Sam Francis's works.It was a very extensive collection spanning 5 decades. The detailed biography greatly illustrate the tenacity and passion of this iconic artist. It helps viewers appreciate his artistic development more.I wish this museum allows photography. Personally, the best part of visiting a museum or gallery is the photos you take as momentos. No photos allowed inside , so I'm reduced to takings photos of the structure of the building.",3Kells
50,The Best Sam Francis Exhibit Ever,"The Museum goes from strength to strength. Now on exhibit is the first major exhibit of Sam Francis' work in many years. The array of paintings is comprehensive and uplifting. Francis is one of the major artists of his time and this exhibit displays a very comprehensive survey of his works together with excellent historical and explanatory texts. on his career. One would expect to find a show of this magnitude at the Met or MOMA or LACMA, it is that good. Go if for no other reason than that the paintings are beautiful and joyful!",rossbacher
50,A quirky little museum,"I don't go here as much as I would like, but am always impressed when I do. I believe It started with the private collection of a couple who live(d) in the penthouse of the narrow 3 story building.

40,Great exhibit of L.A. scenes,"This museum is small but in April, 2013 had a wonderful exhibit of ""local artists"" who worked in the Los Angeles area in the 20th century, mostly the 20s through 50s. These paintings and prints really convey the area as it was as it was growing into what it is today. If you appreciate local art of this type or want to look through a window to a former time, don't miss this.",sefandjgf
50,Small but nice museum,Happened to fall into this museum after doing a search on Trip advisor. Glad I found it. A very small space but it was interesting and a great way to spend an hour or two. And when you go to Pacific Asian Museum next store the have a deal in admission. And there is free parking. Spend part of the day at these two museums and then get a bite in Old Town.,Boca062
50,Edgar Payne exhibit is magnificent,"If the recent Edgar Payne exhibit is typical of this museum's shows, you should include a visit for certain. The show and probably all their shows feature work you will not see outside of California.",jcbexleyoh
50,Bright and Energetic Design Space showcases California Art,"Attended the First Friday Open House for the Edgar Payne exhibit. The Museum offers a free first Friday, so this is a great opportunity to engage the community. The exhibit was well presented. We loved the gift shop and found many unique books as well as a poster from a past exhibit. The gift shop has unique children's items that are great for introducing kids to exploring art.Overall, it is a very contemporary feeling and worth the visit. It is not a large overwhelming collection, so it is perfect for exposing young children to art in an open space. We wished there were more to see by the end!",sandiegosunshinemom

50,"The current Edgar Payne impressionist exhibit is a ""must see""","You should go now! The Edgar Payne exhibit (which is extensive) is amazing! He lived 1882 -- 1947 & was an early American Impressionist. I can't say enough how much we enjoyed looking at his work. His understanding of light on landscapes & subjects and the large scale oil paintings of CA, the US, Europe, etc. are so good, I can't can't use words to describe it. This exhibit is Jun 3, 2012 to Oct. 14, 2012. I feel so lucky that we saw it. My daughter has a BFA in Art & was a first year High School art teacher this year & she helped me understand the lighting and perspective, etc. when we looked at the paintings. We have seen a lot, having been to the Getty, the Norton-Simon, The Getty Villa, etc., etc. but the work by Edgar Payne is really insightful and a pleasure to look at. We made a weekend of it staying Fri & Sat nite at Courtyard Marriott, Monrovia, just outside of Arcadia, & we saw the Pacific Asian Museum, and the PMCA which is next door & you don't even need to move your car. Free parking at either location. You get 1/2 off your ticket at the 2nd of these museums, just show them your receipt from whichever one you see first. We highly recommend you have lunch or dinner at Fresh Thai in Pasadena -- we loved it. Older kids that have the patience to look at & appreciate art may like this museum. There was some really modern stuff in the front that was interesting, but the star was Edgar Payne",Nancy W
50,Well designed art space with interesting exhibitions,"First time at this small but excellent museum. You ascend from the street level free parking garage up a tiled spiral staircase (or elevator, if you prefer) to a handsome lobby. For a nominal charge you have access to three good sized galleries and an interesting museum store. During our visit all galleries were hung with works by Edgar Payne, an early California Impressionist. We understand that this was the largest showing of his work in more than forty years. The museum's aim is to showcase California art and artists of the past and present and certainly in this exhibition that purpose was well realized. We look forward to returning for other exhibitions.",rcatesby
50,another lovely regional art centre,"nothing to dislike, thought it great and they are receptive to having children - none of the texan nasher panic (: . they have activities for kids, outdoor sculpture areas and if you are travelling with your enfant terrible its a good bet for a quite moment chilling on the grass while they muck about.",leslie r
40,Interesting place for Art lovers,"This museum located in Pasadena where there are lots of great things around, restaurants & shops.

50,A Superb Museum of California Painting,"The PMCA is one of the most interesting museums in Southern California. It specializes in beautifully curated special exhibitions of California artists from the past and the present. At present there are two exhibits: LA RAW a historical survey of abstract expressionism ( or abject expressionism ) with interesting examples of paintings from native artists who by ans large went on to better work and a riveting exhibit of the late John Bunkhall's works, both paintings and drawings. Bunkhall, who died tragically young at age 45, was a master painter and drawer who fulfilled his promise as a major painter. His work is too little known. One of the strengths of the PMCA is mounting these kind of showings of brilliant artists from California who are too little known or somewhat forgotten. The museum has its own free parking garage and very modest fees. The exhibits are well mounted in two spacious galleries. The is a shop with a good collection of books on California artists.",rossbacher
