50,Amazing cave kayaking with Blue Ocean Kayaking,"Kayaking in and out of calm ocean caves is very memorable and exciting experience. I checked a few web sites. Only Blue ocean Kayaking provides the complete one stop trip. The other tour companies require a separate ferry booking which is not always available. We explored caves, watched birds and encountered seals and dolphins. A few people also took the opportunity to snorkel. A great family fun. Captain Garrett and guide Johnny were awesome. We'd definitely recommend the tour with Blue Ocean Kayaking.",roadpro99
50,So fun!,The caves are all beautiful and so fun tho kayak through. We booked well in advance through Santa Barbara kayaking and they were awesome. The guides taught us about some of the marine life and the birds. Definitely a must if you are on the island.,800dash
50,Adventure Tour through Santa Barbara Kayaking Company,"We just got back from California and this tour was a highlight of our trip. The staff, boat crew, and guides were all friendly, helpful, and working hard to make sure we had an enjoyable experience.We got to see quite a bit of wildlife. In addtion to birds, a very large pod of dolphins followed the boat on our way over; while kayaking, two sea lions frolicked near our kayaks; and, a very cute island fox slept by our picnic table as we ate our lunch.The kayaking was fun. There was a lot of sea kelp, and kayaking through it was a workout. Most people kayaked in doubles. My impression of the trip from the website was that the trip was to kayak around the island to see wildlife and learn about the ecology of the channel islands. Our tour guide was great (and extremely knowledgeable about flora and fauna of the island and ocean), but I felt like the trip was more about learning the technical aspects of kayaking through sea caves. It was fun, but, not a relaxing kayaking tour.We ordered lunch delivery through Channel Island Provisioners since we were visting from the East Coast and staying at a hotel. The food and service were amazing. Well worth the $30 per person.",Jkaykay19
50,Must visit!!,This was my favorite thing that we saw on Santa Cruz island. You cannot just hike on the island and bypass the amazing sights of the sea caves. Painted Cave is the biggest cave in the world and it was stunning.,Michael W
40,First Time Kayaking in the Sea,"Had a great time kayaking - a little scary on some of the small entrances, but our guide was great at giving instructions. Two people to a kayak, so my daughter and I had to figure out how to work together. FYI - you only go to one island.",Meridie B
50,Sea Cave Kayak tour,Excellent adventure for novice kayakers. Guides were knowledgeable on sea live and island history. Safety was most important and we were well equipped with wet suits and gear. Fun experience for group of family or friends. My group was 7 family/friends plus 1 guide. Perfect!Ferry ride was 90 minutes and included whale and dolphins.,Beth H
50,The Painted Cave was awesome!,"The Painted Cave was awesome! Not all Island Packers boats visit the Painted Cave. Ask Island Packers about the Cave, weather and tides limit access to the Cave.Traveling around Santa Cruz Island we saw other sea caves. Perhaps great for kayaking and exploring.",Cavydad
50,Unique,Went inside the cave in a boat. Could smell sea lions. It was a unique experience. Largest known cave in the world. This island has many caves but this was unique,sorabh
50,So many caves so little time,"Scorpion anchorage has so many caves, but so does Anacapa. We were able to visit the caves on the north side of Anacapa with channel islands charter aboard the GoodWife. It was amazing they provided both double and single Kayaks and we had an amazing lunch too.",Sean Q
50,Stunning amazing kayak trip,"We went on the 3 hour kayak trip out of Scorpion anchorage with SB Adventure Company. Conditions were perfect; bright sunny skies and calm seas. I had my 81-year-old stepfather and my wife, who does not swim. It was awesome. Chuck, our guide took us into about 7 caves. Everybody had a great time. Epic day. Rent the snorkel gear too if you have time. Water is crystal clear and full of cool fish.",HmanSacto
50,A highlight!,"Kayaking in and out of the sea caves on the Channel Island Adventures Company tour was a highlight of our trip to the Channel Islands. We went on the 1.5 hour trip and went in and out of 5 caves. The caves were quite short and we were in and out of each of them in maybe 30 seconds or so. I was expecting the caves to be longer and take more time, but that wasnâ€™t the case on the tour we took. Nonetheless, they were very interesting and I can highly recommend kayaking! We are experienced kayakers but we had some in our group who had never kayaked before and they had no problems keeping up and going in and out of the caves. I would definitely go again, but next time take the 2.5 or maybe even 5 hour tour.",tinaNtravel
50,World Class Sea Caves,"Our group was experienced kayakers. We brought all of our own gear. We explored over 40 sea caves, tunnels and arches. Santa Cruz Island is a Mecca for sea caves - we had a blast! If you are new to kayaking or rent your gear, PLEASE WEAR YOUR PFD AT ALL TIMES!! Saw too many kayakers not wearing their PFD (one is too many!) Wear a helmet, count sets, be smart and Enjoy!! There are a number of guided sea cave kayaking tours you can sign up for in the Channel Islands. Make sure your outfitter gives you a helmet (one outfitter did not issue helmets).",Greg L
50,Loved the sea caves.,"We took with Discovery Sea Kayaking tour with Santa Barbara Adventures. They were great. Our guide was Aqua ""from Aqualina"" so she said. We learned later from another guide that her real name is Jaqueline. She was an awesome guide and spent just the right amount of time going over the basics of kayaking before we headed out to the sea caves. It was a great way to get some exercise and see a part of the islands we otherwise would not have seen. Definitely recommend the sea kayaking if you're going out to Santa Cruz Isalnd",BRIDGET B
50,Channel Islands Adventure Company,We had a wonderful day kayaking along the coast and into sea caves with the Channel Islands Adventure Company.,jbdclaw
50,"Interesting thing to do, while at Santa Cruz Island","We kayaked with the Santa Barbara adventure company. We were a group of 4, out of which 2 of us had booked the activity in advance, while 2 weren't sure until the morning of this activity.SB Adventure company were very accommodating when our friends decided to join in later. Marc, our kayak guide was very knowledgeable and took us to three different sea caves - limbo, L and Greenroom. On our way back, he made us take a narrower tunnel out of the L cave. It was very exciting!Marc also helped us identify different wildlife around the island - birds, harbor seal, kelps, purple sea urchins etc. and overall it was a fun afternoon activity on the island.Absolutely recommend them!",Dhwani Parekh
50,Sea kayaking was amazing!,We went on a tour with the adventure company that does sea kayaking - and it was great. We have only kayaked on flat water before but love adventure- and this was super. The guide Chuck was very knowledgeable but also super personable- and did a fantastic job.,Sue L
50,Kayaking through the sea caves is the best day trip on Santa Cruz Island,"We took a day trip to the Santa Cruz Islands, spent 4 hours of kayaking tour. First, we were not sure if we were able to do it since we did not have much sea kayak experience. However, the sea caves were so interesting, we had to go. Our 2 tour guides, one in the front to lead the group, one at the end to make sure none of us behind the group. We passed one sea cave after another, each of them had different shape. The most interesting one was looked like an elephant. We passed the elephant legs without difficulty, but went back by the elephant trunk was challenging, too narrow to maneuver through. Some of sea caves had low ceiling, therefore, your head might hit the ceiling when the wave pushed you up. Some of the sea caves were very large, we found a sea lion was sleeping there. We quickly retreated out. When we passed one corner of the island, the water was rough. It was a good exercise to against the waves to kayak. When we completed the tour, we were so happy because we saw and learned some much and also felt an accomplishment.",Jenny201110
50,"If you visit the Channel Islands, make sure you do this","When my husband and I took a day trip to the Channel Islands, our kayak tour to the sea caves was the highlight of the day. Our guide was with the Santa Barbara Adventure Company on Santa Cruz Island. He was very professional, and gave us great instruction on how to be safe and how to maneuver in and out of the caves. It was a exciting and interesting, as well as good exercise! I highly recommend it.",Margaret Y
50,Painted Cave,An unexpected treat to this awesome cave on our way back from Santa Rosa Island. Santa Cruz has so many sea caves and arches but Painted Cave is so amazing. I've never seen such a beautiful cave.,dmbakerphd
50,Must-do day trip. An LA gem! Feels like you're outside of the USA!,"Kayaking around these historic island sea caves makes you feel like you're on vacation outside of the US! Most of my local LA friends haven't even done this trip (or know about it).The water can be rough, but it's so crystal clear and the caves are so worth it. I recommend a head lamp and a GoPro to capture the action! We used Islandkayaking.com for a guided tour but I would love to do it another time independently!",mgerber18
50,Must do when in LA,We booked our thrip through SB adventures and had an amazing time. Its an hour ride to the island. We did the 1.5 hr kayak tour and our guides were awesome. It was such a cool experience. you should take a packed lunch as there is no food on the island.,rgarg_23
50,Coolest thing ever !,"On the way back from our trip via the ferry, they took us to the back side of one of the Islands where the ferry boat was able to glide into Painted Cave. The sea was very rough that day and I had heard that they do that, but was afraid with the sea being so rough, that we might not be able to do it. My hat is off to the Captain and I was very impressed with the opportunity to see and witness this great adventure. Have a picture of that now on my desktop.",rebusinessforms
50,Wowcean!,"This is a must for adventure seekers. Just a short ride offshore in the Channel Islands National Park is Anacapa Island. With its rocky shoreline, thousands of birds, and, the best, sea caves that you can take a kayak into. Go with a guide-some are really hard to see even when you are a few feet away. Don't try padd;ing from the mainland-too far and busy shipping lanes.",Robert B
50,Awesome time,This was so cool. This is a must if you like kayaking or even if you're new to it. The caves are really cool. Our guide was wonderful and it was a very memorable trip.,Rita S
50,Caves for varied levels of kayakers,"Some of the deeper caves indeed looked like the above photo -- some were much narrower and more challenging. Remarkable how different each cave was, ""Green Room"" illuminated from sub surface sunlight, ""Boombox"" with huge basso wave noise. unless you are an expert, would strongly recommend up to date guide-- caves change from rapid erosion and varying tides as well as weather, so written guides are rapidly out of date. Thrill levels range from young (swimming/kayaking) kids to expert adults. Day trips to closer caves, most guided trips work with boat arrival and departure hours given kayak distances and abilities.",Forrest B
50,Unique and Awe-inspiring,"The Sea Caves are accessible by kayak. You can probably rent your own but there are a lot of guided tours that will take you out. They know the lay of the land and whether certain caves can be explored depending on swells and stuff so if you're not experienced, they're a good way to go. The caves themselves are SO beautiful. I closed my eyes for a moment and thought about how they were created by the crashing waves over such a long period of time. Some are vast and others are small and tricky to get through. But just being under the island, those cliffs, just felt pretty stunning. A must-do at some point. Sea caves are gorgeous.",Kate O
40,Adventurous Trip,"My friend and I booked the Sea Cave kayaking tour through Santa Barbara Adventures. I was expecting a relaxing kayak trip through caves, but the kayaking was very strenuous and at times technical. The ocean was rough and we kayaked through waves and ""foam tornadoes"". We were in a group of 15 kayaker with 3 guides. Most people were in double kayaks and a few in singles. My friend and I were in singles and were the only girls in singles (might have been easier if we were in a double). My friend was not able to navigate around one portion of the rocks and one of the guides towed her in by attaching her kayak to hers. That being said, Santa Barbara Adventures did an excellent job on the tour. They were very easy to find when we arrived at the dock for check in, one guide was waiting there to check in arriving group members. He explained what would be happening and gave us our boarding passes for the boat to the island. Both guides were VERY thorough with their instructions and made sure everyone knew what to do on the trip. When we got out on the water they had us practice maneuvers before we headed out. Both guides were very attentive to the group and although I thought the trip was a little scary and more adventure than I had anticipated, I had the utmost confidence in our guides and felt safe with them leading our group. One couple capsized in their kayak, but were able to get It turned over and get back in and the woman credited the expertise of the guides and their instruction the reason they were able to do it so efficiently. I would highly recommend Santa Barbara Adventure Company!Santa Barbara Adventure Company provided everything needed for the kayak trip. They had wetsuits if you desired...I chose not to...board shorts, bathing suit and a windbreaker were sufficient. They also had windbreaker jackets for everyone. Also, everyone has to wear a helmet and they also provided the helmets.So, a few other things.....bring a change of clothes (including shoes) because you will get wet and unless you want wear wet clothes all day long, you'll want a dry set (especially for the boat ride back). You can throw al your extra gear in a box with the tour group. Bring a lunch and snacks...there is nothing on the island. Bring a jacket for the boat ride to and from the island as the wind can get chilly. When you're done kayaking you'll have opportunity to hike or snorkel or do nothing if you choose. We hiked when we were done and the trails were beautiful. Truthfully, I could have spent the day hiking.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was a much more adventurous trip than I had planned. I wouldn't have wanted to take young children on the trip. There was not any problem with Santa Barbara Adventure Company; they did an amazing job. I think people should know that weather and ocean conditions can make a huge impact on how easy or difficult the trip is. The boat ride over was provided by Island Packers and they were awesome. The captain of the boat took a detour on the trip over because he spotted a humpback whale and took us to see it; we also saw dolphin and sea lions on the trip to the island.All the vendors were excellent in their competence and service, but be aware..the kayaking adventure can be difficult.",Jody D
50,Just an amazing day,"We went through the Santa Barbara Adventure company for kayak tours and they were so very organized and helpful in providing us with a totally wonderful day. We booked online, they called to confirm several times to ensure we received notices and messages, and they made it all very easy. We met our guide, Aaron, at the pier. He was the best. Just THE best. Ask for him as your guide because he has a lot of knowledge of the islands and the wildlife as well as history of the area. He was so patient with our son too who is a special needs child. The Islands and caves were so beautiful,and rare for this area. To see caves like this in California is a real treat.It's a full day, early ferry ride was spectacular with dolphins, seals and a humpback whale sighting. Wow! Bring your camera, sunscreen and hat. I recommend coming during the week for less crowds and a chance to have smaller groups per guide.",Laura L
50,Love the Caves!,"We have done this trip countless times and the views never disappoint. Kayaking into the caves is one of the most thrilling experiences you will ever have. It's important to be safe, so we always recommend a guide for first timers.",VenturaCountyCoast
50,A+ for Amazing!,You won't want to miss these gigantic sea caves. Kayaking through them is thrilling but definitely dangerous. Best for more experienced kayakers.,dsrtgrl
40,Small but Delightful,"My husband and brother-in-law camped out on Santa Cruz island and rented our own kayaks for the daytime adventuring. The sea caves were quaint but still fun to explore, and be sure you listen to the guide prior to arriving on the island because the water can be tricky to navigate through and it can be dangerous if you go out on your own like we did with 5-10 minute swells. We loved the experience though and would do it again.",Priscilla G
40,Not a Very Long Cave,"Let me start by stating that my expectations of what a ""sea cave"" actually is was a little off. You paddle through openings in the rock formations and paddle out the other side. They are not long dark caves that you spend longer then a couple of minutes going through. I would recommend checking out the Painted Caves as an alternative. That tour was only offered on weekends and wasn't an option for us. It is a bit expensive for a family but it is ""a once in a lifetime experience"" so I would still recommend it.",Bounderoo
50,Once in lifetime experience,"My wife and I are in our 60's and out to see all the nation's National Parks. We booked a kayak tour of the sea caves from an outfitter out of Santa Barbara, took the ferry out of Ventura, and met our guide, Rye, on the beach.After a brief training we suited up and spent the next four hours paddling in and out of sea caves. This ended up being my favorite activity on a 3 1/2 week National park trip.A couple things to know - you'll have to get in the water to relieve yourself which means you need to know how to exit and re-enter a kayak in deep water. If you tend to get cramps or get stiff, be prepared. Four hours is a long time in a kayak.Rye was an amazing and enthusiastic guide and his love of the caves was contagious. Some of the caves are very narrow and at high tide very tight, but be adventurous and do them all, you'll never regret it.The kayaks are very stable and you have a life vest, so relax and enjoy. Wear a swimsuit and take layers. Be sure you have beach shoes or something like Keens. Take sunscreen and water. Use your smart phone for pics, do not take a good camera.",Ted O
50,Awesome adventure,"The caves are awesome. And seeing them from a kayak is the coolest. The water and air temperatures were great. We were never cold or too hot, but don't forget to wear lots of sun screen.",Francois P
50,Incredibly fun,"We did a sea kayak tour on Santa Cruz island. We got the boat from Ventura. It's quite easy to find and plenty of parking. Arrive a little early so that you can complete forms. There are other kayak tours and campers and day hikers leaving from this spot so you have to find the right check in person. But that is no problem at all.The boat ride over is about an hour. If u get sea sick take some Dramamine before hand. There are snacks and drinks to buy on the boat.Once you arrive you head to the kayaks where they will go through a safety and education piece. Don't worry if you've never kayaked before there are all levels here.You can store your stuff in a big container while you kayak. Bring some water and maybe a snack for the kayak tour. Depending on the temp u may feel cold and they have jackets and bottoms u can borrow and wear as u will get very wet and inside the caves can be chilly. We did not feel we needed them and it was overcast when we were there.You'll kayak for a couple of hours. It's tiring! Be aware of this :) but so much fun. The caves are incredible and the guides are knowledgeable fun and safe. They will help you if you need it. One of our party got exhausted and one of the guides just towed them.When you get back you can then hike or snorkel. They provide wet suits and all the gear.There is nothing on the island, so bring food and water with you and a change of clothing, again if the temps are low u will want to have something warm to put on.I really enjoyed this trip it was probably one of the best kayak tours I've done.Afterwards a few of us snorkeled in the kelp forest which was surreal and beautiful and some of us hiked.",racgeo
50,So many caves so little time,"Enjoy going in and out of the sea caves on our Santa Cruz Island trip. You can join a group or go on your own but you should know how to kayak and have the right equipment (kayak, floating device and helmet)",Stella E
50,Fun sport adventure!,"The sea caves of Santa Cruz island are really cool to see. We saw them by kayak. We arranged a guided kayak trip with Aquasports. We kayaked the sea caves for two days. Kayak is the only way to see the caves. My only cautions about the sea caves are to know what you are signing up for. WHen I was booking the trip, my impression was I would be on a sightseeing trip that included guided kayaking and self-guided hiking. The kayaking, however, is approached more as a sporting adventure by our Aquasports guide. It is sporting as in the people who like to do this enjoy challenging their kayak skills by getting into tight spaces, making quick turns, and navigating obstacles for the fun of it. These are things you do not need to do just for sightseeing, but are done for the joy of kayaking. This was a small but noticeable difference between my expectation and reality. Also relevant to the point is that the kayaking was extensive and fatiguing for two ladies who are not so fit in this regard. To have the best time, know what you are signing up for, and be ready to work hard. The caves are fabulous, and an experience not readily had elsewhere. Sea conditions are extremely variable, as is the wind, and we totally lucked out with quite calm weather. Highly recommended, but stay flexible.",DonnaSPDX
50,Crystal clear water and amazing caves to explore,"We got very lucky and visited at a time when the water was crystal clear. We could see all the way to the ocean floor. Fish, kelp, seals in abundance. The cave exploration was easy to navigate and each was unique and interesting. Great way to spend the day!",Fifistravels
50,Extraordinary Santa Cruz Island Kayaking Trip,"This past weekend, Saturday / 8-29-14, we did a kayaking trip to Santa Cruz Island, Channel Islands, 11 miles off of California's coast between Ventura and Santa Barbara, with the Santa Barbara Adventure Company; Adam Sachs was our SBAC guide and he was great. He explained the kayaking methods and the habitat, rock formations, history of the area, and he was a great kayaker and trainer. We ventured in and out of some incredible and beautiful caves, with blue water and incredible rock formations. We had done another kayaking trip with this adventure not too long ago and we came back because that experience was so pleasurable. We had a different guide this time, but the result was the same! We do kayak quite a bit, and this area is by far the best place that we have ever kayaked. We are planning on doing many others with SBAC again, and we will be back! Thanks again!! Bob & Theresa G. - Foothill Ranch, Southern California",Bob G
50,Awesome Sea Kayaking,"This is a special adventure with some degree of technical difficulty and physical stamina needed but mostly just focus and appreciation. We loved being on the ocean and paddling through the caves. On the ocean we saw lots of critters--dolphins, sea lions, sun fish, cor,morants, ducks, pelicans and of course seagulls. Our guides were uber conscious of the environment and very skilled. All in all, we loved the trip and will be back.",aresverde
50,Aquasports Was THE BEST!,"We took a group of 6 Girl Scouts camping and kayaking this past weekend, and it was the most unique experience that the girls (and us leaders!) will remember forever!! First - the kayaking - i really don't know why I haven't heard more about this! Spectacular hardly seems the word! I read that this part of Santa Cruz Island has the largest concentration of sea caves in the world. Going in and out of the caves, the clear water, and it didn't hurt that it was a nice sunny day - all made for a wonderful experience. Our guides, Andy and Rachid were just perfect. They knew the sea, the tide, and the water conditions, even directing us around two harbor seals - a protected animal. They showed us a nesting bird feeding her babies, and helped us listen for the sound of a Peregrine Falcon. Awesome!! In addition to their knowledge of the caves, the sea, the island, the animals, they were great with our group!! At one point, two of our girls were getting a little queasy, so we stopped for a bit and then they directed us to a calmer part of the water. Their easy-going attitude, but knowledgeable manner help this to be the highlight of our trip!",cwgiraffe
40,Even the unskilled can handle sea caves!,"Yes a kayak tour is expensive BUT so worth it!My suggestion for sea kayaking is Aquasports out of Ventura. I saw the other tours with 10+ people while Aquasports tour group was my husband and I with another couple. I'm not saying that this will always be the case, but check it out first. I have a slight fear of being in the open ocean so sea kayaking sounded pretty scary to me. Our tour guide, Tony, had a lot of experience (kayak and rescue) and knowledge (life and education). It felt like a private customized-tour instead of being with heaps of people. I felt safe while exploring caves and being exposed to the open sea. Got a tandem kayak which I would suggest if you're not an avid kayaker. Since we were such a small group, we were able to do caves that other tour groups weren't doing. Tony was patient and extremely skilled. I couldn't not have asked for a better guide. Tours usually last 2 1/2 hours, but ours went on for much longer.",Gonzowuz
50,Sea Kayaking in and out of Caves,"I have to agree with the recent reviewers. The kayaking was at the top of my grand,daughter and my list of the adventures we had on a recent trip to the area. Money well spent. We went with Aqua Sports and would highly recommend them. We went in small groups with a very knowledgeable guide. We had high winds and some white caps so thankful for a tandem kayak and the strength of a 16 year old.",grannysgonetrekin
50,Kayaking the sea caves,Visiting the sea caves with Channel Islands Charter will be the time of your life. We see tons of sea lions and well as harbor seals that beach themselves in the caves. Last trip we were surrounded in our kayaks by baby sea lions. Incredible!,Sean Q
50,Sea Cave Kayaking Channel islands,Don't miss this out!!! You have to do this if you go to channel islands! Kayaking in the ocean is way different from kayaking on a lake and going through sea caves is challenging but exciting and gorgeous! Its the best 340$ I spent (for 2 people),aspirate
50,Incredible Sea Cave,Spectacular!!!! I kept thinking I was thousands of miles away from home when we are right here in our very front yard.,WellHelloBaby
50,Wonderful,Beautiful and scary to go into. I'm an unskilled kayaker and I was able to do it with guidance and it was beautiful. So glad I ventured out and did this.,Nina T
30,Unique kayaking attraction - take a guide,"When looking for things to do in Channel Islands, the sea caves on Santa Cruz Island often show up as a recommended activity. Having some experience kayaking, we rented a 2-person boat from Channel Islands Kayaks in Ventura and decided to give it a go.While it is certainly unique to be able to paddle through caves, we felt the trip would have been more rewarding with a guide. First, the maps they provide to renters are cartoony and not to scale. We don't really know if we saw all the good caves or not. Second, the rental rates are high enough that if you plan on camping on the islands, you're better off using a guide for one day so you don't have to rent overnight.High seas made it difficult to approach a couple of them, but the ones we saw were an interesting mix. Some are just recesses into the rock, while others are actually tunnels. The light can play interesting tricks creating strange color effects in the water. There are also seals and a number of sea birds all around. Nothing about the caves (that we saw) was worth a return trip, but we enjoyed the paddling.",Michael K
