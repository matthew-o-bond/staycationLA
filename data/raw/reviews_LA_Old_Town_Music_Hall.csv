40,"This is an old time Movie house, make an effort to visit it before its gone.","Had friends visiting from Italy here for the Janet Klein and Her Parlor Boys show. This is a real blast from the past Movie House, with lots of red and gold splashed around and classic chandeliers overhead.The floor is flat with odd moving seats not so comfortable, but with a good view of stage. We had a fantastic night with live music and old time black and white movie, even had a couple numbers from the Mighty Wurlitzer. Janet is loads of fun never a boarding minuet, her shows are charming and sweet with a little twist and a very talented band.TIP: It’s hard to book tickets over the phone but keep trying it’s worth the effort.",Michael B
50,Good ole days,Wonderful day at The Old Town Musoc Hall. Went to see The old movie from the 50’s Sunset Blvd. fun watching the player piano amd singing,Climber35009860417
50,Lots of fun for $10,"Went here with friends to see a Marx brothers film from the 30's. It was preceded by a short talk on the history of the theatre and the organ. Then a 20 minute or so organ concert of songs of the 30's. Then a sing along with words projected on the screen. More from the 30-40's. This was followed by a short comic film. This alone was worth the $10.Then we saw the Marx Brothers Animal Crackers. Always funny and silly. The audio was not too clear but remember is was recorded with 30's technology.Plenty of parking. Use the lot next door on the weekends. Do not be intimidated by the sign. Enforced weekdays.Lots of restaurants, bars, and grills nearby.Limited snacks and drinks.",Ray S
50,Well Worth a Visit,"Wonderful old theater with lots of atmosphere. The owners really went all out to decorate for Halloween and the screenings of the iconic 1925 “Phantom of the Opera”. I just wish the seats were more comfortable, but for the reasonable price of admission, I guess the seats are livable. If you haven’t been to the Old Town, I highly recommend it for an enjoyable and nostalgic few hours.",FrequentTraveller034
50,"Old Town Music Hall - Movies, sing along and Wurlitzer pipe organ.","If you want to enjoy a true experience of the past from an original theater to the Mighty Wurlitzer organ. And a true legend Bill Field plays it before movies and as part of sing-a-longs.Silent movies, classic movies and concerts. Wow!The film we saw yesterday was the first movie shown at Old Town Music Hall 50 years ago called “Hell’s Angels” Directed by Howard Hughes. With Jean Harlow.What a wonderful afternoon.... see there web site for upcoming movies and events.",Walter R
50,Wonderful sounds and sights!,"Attended the 2:30pm Saturday matinee of black and white comedy movies- The show opened with a great piano piece by man of many talents (sold snacks and was the projectionist). Then Bill (one of the Bills and co-founder of the Old Town Music Hall) played several pieces on the organ- when the curtains opened- revealed riveting neon lights that outlined the pipes and pieces. A screen came down just behind the organ and information on the current and upcoming programs were shown. Next, a sing along- words of old favorites (e.g., Tea for two) projected on the screen while Bill played and the audience sang. We say three short silent movies (Noah Ark's Jr with Our Gang 1920s and another with a car, and Love em & weep- with Laurel & Hardy before they were a duo) that were accompanied by Bill playing the organ. After a 15 minute intermission we saw the last three short movies that had sound (e.g., a 1930s- Valentine's Day at School with the Little Rascals, The Dentist with WC Fields, and The Chimp with Laurel & Hardy).Great coffee and delicious fresh macaroons (from Porto's Bakery). A wonderful way to spend 3 hours!",DeborahandAndy
50,Jazz Age Time Machine,"If you love the Roaring 20's you have to visit this place. From the plinky pre-show piano music to the room-sized, glow-in-the-dark organ, it's a step back to a time when lips were bow-shaped and writers were called F. Scott.We went there to see Chaplin's hilarious City Lights, (a 30's film) and really enjoyed it and the sing-along that came before. The theater itself is flamboyantly gorgeous - kind of like an antique store mixed with the House on the Rock. It's one of the few examples in the L.A. area of well-preserved architectural history, and I'm so glad the owners and the city of El Segundo see fit to keep it alive.",BMunchausen
50,Amazing show and facility,What an amazing throw back to black and white movies and cartoons today.The music and comedy before the movie along with the sing along was outstanding.The owner was there and was very friendly.We will be back for sure,X9339ASmikeb
50,A Local Treasure,This theater is really a gem. It's been on the historic Richmond Street in El Segundo for as long as I have lived here even longer. A beautiful Worlitzer (sp) organ is in the back under the screen so you sit in a time capsule really watching old movies from silent to talkies with the best being the silent ones being accompanied by the sounds of that organ. It's something you should not miss!! Take the kids for a slice of the olden days. I took my dad and he literally went back in time!,budcalifornia
40,My mother loved it!,Took my mom (senior citizen) here and she had a great time. Laughed hard at the over acting of the silent movies and really enjoyed the pipe organ and the sing along. She wanted to take all her friends from here senior community for a day out together. If you've never seen a pipe organ played it's a must see and hear. Very enjoyable.,Kim B
50,A Grrrreat Sunday with Family and Friends (Laurel & Hardy Film Festival),"This was my first visit (Though I live just 15 mins away from this theater) to view The Laurel & Hardy Film Festival with my brother and two friends from NorCal on Sunday Nov. 29th, 2015. I didn't know this theater had been around since 1968, and is run by a gentleman named Bill Field (He handles the daily operations and plays the 'Mighty Wurlitzer' Pipe Organ). The film festival included two pre-talkie silent L&H shorts that Bill played his 'Mighty Wurlitzer' while the films were projected and he added the right sound effects when needed. It was a BLAST!!! After intermission, three more Laurel & Hardy shorts (talkies) were shown to finish the afternoon. I strongly recommend visiting this theater for special festivals like this one. It was a treat for all those who attended (The audience tilted toward seniors, but I noticed all age groups in the theater). FIVE CLAWS UP!!!!! Thanks for reading my review. Joe G. Bear - Redondo Beach, CA",Joe G. Bear
50,"Fun evening, something different","Never knew this existed, but my son had to go for his film appreciation class. The theater is open on the weekends, check their website. They take only cash $10 or $8 for seniors. There was parking permit signs in the lot next to the theater owned by the refinery. They said we could park there without a problem so we did. No issue. We enjoyed looking around before the show, while a player plano played. Then a live performance on a piano that was 101 years old. We heard a brief history of the theater and the organ. Hearing the wurlitzer was amazing. There was a sing along, a laurel and hardy short and a 15 minute intermission. We watched the ghost and mrs muir, which we all enjoyed. I'm thinking I'll be back. Also a neat place to take a date.",RPVTravelmore
50,Awesome!!!,This is a must if you're into great movies. The atmosphere and the venue are great! I went with friends a while ago and I will definitely be taking the family as soon as I can.,sfjensen
50,Unique,We were fortunate to visit LA and visited during their well supported Laurel and Hardy festival. This might not be to everyone's taste but is certainly a unique and fun experience,exafrica
50,Have you ever wanted to go back in time,"This place is very dated in it's look and feel. But that's the BEST part because you actually feel the authenticity of it all. I've been twice. Do your research on what films are being played so you can pick one which suites you best.The first time I saw 3 features which were comedy. Tonight I saw ""Wings"" which is an action packed war love story. There were laughs, tears and action.The show begins with a sing-a-long and the entire movie soundtrack is performed by a live organ player.There are snacks for $2 each item and the price for the show is $10. They also have special showings which require a reservation and the cost is $20 per person.This hidden little theater is a gem. Enjoy the show!",lowbuxlux
50,El Segundo's finest hidden treasure...LOVE IT!,"Thanks to Bill Field and Bill Coffman, who lovingly teamed up in the 1960's to save and restore this old time 1921 theatre in the historic downtown district neighborhood of El Segundo, we are now able to enjoy classic films dating back to the 1920's as well as be amazed and entertained by the pre-show concert with the Fields on the Mighty Wurlitzer Pipe Organ and even an audience sing along to boot! Everything from the seats to the chandeliers were salavaged from around the LA area and added to this theater's wonderfully vintage decor. An picture perfect night out! Old movies and occasional jazz, ragtime and big band music concerts too. Plentiful and easy street parking, ticket prices that won't break the bank and the tastiest homemade treats ever...try the giant macaroon..oh my God..out of this world!This is what a night out on the town should be like. The choice of films is a fantastically fun and quirky collection that can be found on their website. Bill Fields is there every night to welcome his guests, give a personalized intro and background of the theatre and masterfully plays the Wurlitzer (which has neon painted pipes that even glow in the dark!) with themes that coincide with the movie. He has truly given his heart and soul to this theater, and it shows. An absolute first rate entertainment experience.Long live Old Town Music Hall!",Sally M
50,Great night,After doing all the la attractions this was the best of the lot and fantastic value.The sing song at the beginning was a real ice breaker and started a great evening off which we won't forget.,Jpmoss
50,An Afternoon Well-Spent,"Question: What do you get when you combine a short organ recital by our man Bill on the Wurlitzer, an old-fashioned sing-along, a Harold Lloyd short (silent film accompanied by Bill on the organ), homemade macaroons for a snack, and the Marx Brothers' masterpiece ""Duck Soup""?Answer: An afternoon well-spent! Come out and support OTMH!",Penguins3
50,Hidden Gem in El Segundo,I met with a group of friends for a silent movie at the Old Town Music Hall. I had never been there. What a great experience. I highly recommend that people attend. They start off with a $10.00 dollar ticket to get in. Then they have a sing along and an intermission. Popcorn is $2.00 dollars. Then the movie starts. The guy playing the live music is amazing. I would definitely go again for another movie.,Sungal43
50,Wurled Back in Time,The Old Town Music Hall offers the perfect step back in time for both young and old.Our boys were mesmerised by the mighty Wurlitzer beautifully played by Bill Field and any opportunity to see an old movie on the big screen should NEVER be passed up!!!,KEDOBBO
50,Grandkids loved it!,"Walk into an antique small movie theater and after passing several Laural and Hardy dolls, mementos, and through the tiniest lobby you'll ever see, find your seat in ancient padded seats under huge hanging chandeliers. It's literally a museum you become a part of.Every night is a different movie experience but there's a nostalgic memory each time. It all begins with the Wurlitzer organ. A huge beautiful restored instrument in the middle of the stage. However, the treat is finding out that it's not just an organ. It's a control system for bells, whistles, drums, cymbals, chimes, and much more. After listening to an expanding crescendo of sounds, the old time tradition of audience singing starts with music and antique slides of lyrics for everyone to join in. All this is done by hand, no computer simulations.Depending on the night it can be a theme of silent movies accompanied by a person actually playing all the stuff above, to a Charlie Chan mystery, to an old horror movie or musical. We saw a silent Laural and Hardy film and ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"". The grand kids from 8 to 15 have been several times and always love returning.",Ken R
50,A hidden treasure!,"Not many people know about this place but everyone should go. Once you step through the doors, it’s like a step back in time. They have a great selection of silent movies. Pick up the schedule outside and save the date for your favorite movie. Having someone play the pipe organ with all its “bells and whistles” is a real treat!",RjF-LA
50,Incredible,"The Old Town Music Hall is a theater that started life as a movie theater in 1928 and resumed that role again in 1968 when two gents re-opened it along with a vintage Wurlitzer Theater Pipe Organ. If you've never experienced a Wurlitzer there's nothing like it. It was literally the sound track tool for the silent-era movies and many of these Wurlitzers had drums, horns, pianos and all sorts of pipes. The Wurlitzer in the Old Town Music Hall literally takes the entire back wall and is big enough to set-up housing in. It's a beautiful instrument that can only be appreciated in person, there's no review that will offer a true picture of this amazing device.The theater now shows vintage films of both the silent and typical type, some in black-and-white and some in color. These vintage films are a treat and the shows start with a mini concert on the Wurlitzer.I am not aware of any other place that is like this. It's not just the incredible Wurlitzer but the vintage decor, classic movies and friendly surrounds that make this place an incomparable experience. I miss that I can just walk there and enjoy a show as I used to do. This is no cookie cutter experience and your journey will be better if you don't miss an opportunity to experience this unique theater.",Tony B
50,Wonderful end to L.A. vacation,"After a week in the Los Angeles area, we took in the Old Town Music Hall. This is a cozy theatre on the edge of downtown El Segundo. After a wonderful meal downtown on a Saturday night we walked over to see the Laurel and Hardy showcase. The Wurlitzer Organ is amazing and the two men who saved it (I think from a downtown Los Angeles theatre) deserve a lot of credit.Before the movies you get to enjoy a few tunes. Then you try your hand at singing with your fellow moviegoers. It's fun and who cares if you stink?The movies started with a Laurel and Hardy silent film played by the Wurlitzer genius. Then he retires and a ""regular"" talkie played. It was great to hear the laughter, especially from even the smallest children. All this for a measly $8. Of course, this theatre is a labor of love so give a little more in a donation if you want.It's a shame the hotel staff didn't know about this. I asked them where it was when checking in and they didn't know so I had to scout around earlier in the day.",LoneStarTrippin
50,So Much Fun!,"Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights they are open. You have to go just once in your life to see and hear the magnificent 1921 rebuilt massive organ. First, a most wonderful young man plays Ragtime on a very special piano. Then the owner plays the organ. After a few songs (and a fun sing-a-long) they show a short silent movie, and he plays for that too. Intermission follows and then a full length movie from the 1930s or 1940s. It is a most wonderful, home-spun evening out. When Bill plays the organ, the curtain opens and you can see all the pipes and other items (drum, xylophone, castanets) all controlled by the organ. It is worth attending just to see the theater; right out of 1925! This is truly a hidden jewel in El Segundo/Los Angeles! Worth the drive from anywhere in Southern California. Have dinner at the Second City Bistro and then stroll up to the theater. You won't regret it! The show starts at 8:15 PM.",MWG2
