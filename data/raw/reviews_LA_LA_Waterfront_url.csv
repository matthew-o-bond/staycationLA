40,Nice Place for a walk,"Our cruise ship stopped in San Pedro and we had some time to spend here in the afternoon. Besides the cruise port there are several attractions in the area - the USS Iowa, the Maritime Museum and a ferry service over to Catalina Island. The area is nicely developed with good walking paths lined with some trees and benches. Restaurants are just up the street on 6th and 7th streets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan2000
50,A New Beginning for LA Waterfront,The LA Waterfront is under a massive improvement project. The area between 5th and 6th Streets are the first to be completed. The seaport is expected to be fully completed by end of 2020.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cynthia-LAX
40,New Courtesy Docks,"Public mooring has finally arrived in San Pedro. It has always irritated me that there was only 1-3 spots, on the entire waterfront, to park a boat for a few hours. All of those restaurants with no access by boat.Now there is a brand new ""courtesy dock"" where you and I can park a boat, grab a bite, and not have to rush back. 4 hours is the time limit per day. More people should take advantage of this courtesy convenience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Matt_Sersion
40,Nice area to walk around in,Went here on a Saturday afternoon while staying at the nearby Crowne Plaza hotel. The area was busy with lots of people around. I had originally planned to eat here but the eateries looked a little crowded so I just walked a lot and got my daily exercise in. It.looked like the parking might have been an issue but luckily I didn't have to worry about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DouglasH779
50,Nice Area to See and Cruise From - LA Waterfront: Downtown Harbor,We have cruised to Mexico from the harbor area several times There are numerous attractions in the area such as the USS Iowa. There are harbor cruises. As one leaves the harbor there is Angel's Gate Lighthouse. Angel's Gate Lighthouse has been operational since 1913. This area is a nice area to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,Nice seafood places ...,"Found nice place for seafood if you don't mind slight chaos in the environment. Walked around and saw some typical waterfront rights, but other than a couple of harbor/whale watching yours there is not much beyond the restarants. Parking was free, and had a nice time, but place still needs a bit more to make it as a tourist attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z2134VDjonathanl
20,Nice area,Make sure when you come down there is not a cruise ship on the harbor as it makes the traffic insane. Small area with not a lot going on. Cross the bay and go to long beaches Boardwalk. It's 10x nicer and walkable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wick1979
20,"Add this to your ""skip it"" list","The online map of this whole area makes it look compact enough to walk, as though the Red Car trolley is an unnecessary cute little amusement ride. The reality is that this area is far more spread out than you are led to believe and in many cases, the trolley doesn't get you reasonably close enough to many of these attractions. Ports O' Call, which is located in the center of the L.A. Waterfront has been revitalized but is not much more than a bunch of odd little shops, a few so-so eateries and a traffic nightmare to get into. There are a couple of decent restaurants; one is priced on the high end and the other is a serious hike away from Ports O' Call. The Gateway Plaza Fanfare Fountains were located far away in an area where there was room for maybe 20 cars, most of which had to park on the street, and there were children wading in it in between shows like it was some kind of pool. There is a free bus trolley that drops you off and picks you up in about 5 or 6 places, but there are not enough of them. Do yourself a favor and visit Shoreline Village in nearby Long Beach instead, overall a much better and more organized place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IslandLovinTwosome
