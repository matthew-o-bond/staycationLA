30,The wonderful world of Oz exhibit,We were attending the Oz convention in Pomona so Sunday evening they opened the museum just for us. The exhibit was worth the drive and we enjoyed seeing the ruby and silver slippers. The wall of book covers was so colorful too.,Hallsusane
40,Eclectic and Fascinating,"I've been here several times and each visit offers something unique and stimulating. They offer a theme or 'experience', like ""Taste"", ""Matriarchs"", or ""Brain"" represented by a wide range of pieces -- new, older, famous, bizarre, sculpture, still life,etc. ""Taste"" featured food-related works and a 'live' snack stand (a woman passed out Filipino treats). ""Awkward"" was a hilarious look at goofy, embarrassing family photos. They also offer free workshops for adults and children. Well worth a visit for a unique art experience.",stephenrwolcott

30,PHOTO ART MUSEUM IN EL SEGUNDO,We were on our way toWe were on our way to LAX and had some extra time so we stopped at the ESMoA gallery. It's an unusual gallery. There were lots of family photos taken by other family members. Some of the photos were very good while others were not that interesting. I believe that they have other exhibits from time to time.lax,DarylJ552
40,Lucky El Segundo to have a benefactor that shares their art collection,How lucky is El Segundo that the benefactor with a large art collection is willing to share. I have seen some interesting exhibits and looked at some of the works of the artist in residence. I am thankful that the art works are shared and exhibited for the pleasure of the public. Thank you,nancyjesca
50,"Entertaining, educational and beautiful!","As an avid art lover who seeks out large and small fine art museums and quirky or well-established galleries to view and enjoy contemporary art, I was surprised to discover ESMoA in downtown El Segundo. Surprised because contemporary fine art in the beach cities of the South Bay does not have a good track record. Case in point was Gallery C in Hermosa Beach in the old Bijou Theater space. One expects to see beach and surf culture or regional art with little consciousness of art history nor of contemporary fine art discourse around the world. ESMoA is different, and it's free.As a museum, the curatorial direction is different. Each show is built around a ""theme"" and often includes work from the founders' private collection or from the high profile museum partners such as LACMA, Getty Institute or the Wende Museum. And the real thrill is the original, contemporary art on view from a diversity of artists and organizations.Always the experience is engaging and gets one thinking, feeling and doing. It's interactive, participatory and thought provoking to paraphrase the message on the volunteers' T-shirts: GO PROVOKE.Sure, some of the art is not my cup of latte and it's a relatively small space, but at least it engages me and I always come back for more. Do go see, do, experience and tell the world. ESMoA is here to stay. Read the About page on the website. Could not have said it better. Plenty of restaurants within a hop skip and jump, too.",Frances V
50,El Segundo Museum of Art - Unique!,"Wonderful, quaint, unique exhibits of fine arts. Small venue, yet open and uncrowded.Expose yourself to out of the ordinary, run of the mill artists, these artists have unique style that engage the viewer. Exhibits are hung well and uncrowded.How about, Ants walking on a wall? Changing colors? Can you imagine? It is there!Stop in for a thought provoking experience.Then walk up the street, or across the street, to one of the many fine restaurants for dinner or lunch.",LADSunset
50,Visually Stunning,"This is such a great space in a cool little town. They cycle in some very fun, unusual and thought provoking exhibitions. They often have local schools visiting and learning about the current ensemble. The high ceilings allow some very big pieces into the space. Definitely a place to go if you like art.",Kristi Z
50,"Exciting, engaging, and personable","It's exciting to have a museum of art in El Segundo. There focus on education, the community and excellent staff issue cons to none. Their stagg and art available is amazing.",Barbara F
50,A Place for Everyone,"ESMoA is such an awesome space! There are events and activities for visitors of all ages throughout the year, and the educators are always available to answer questions or talk to you about the art. Since it's a small institution with a strong sense of community, it's great for people who aren't interested in traditional museums -- and people who are. There's a place for everyone here, and that's really special.",davenmcq
