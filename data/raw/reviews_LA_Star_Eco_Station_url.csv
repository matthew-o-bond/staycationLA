40,Perfect activity for kids of all ages.,"Fun and educational, this is Star Eco Station. The save animals and share their knowledge with the community. A tour guide helps you explore and learn about the animals.The offer tours and camps during school breaks. We all learned about our animal friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAmandaGreene
50,School Field Trip,"The children had a great time, the staff was friendly and informative. The group was large so the staff decided into two groups. The first group went to see the different rescued animals and learned alot about endangered animals, the environment and things we all can do to protect the animals and our environment the other half got to learn more about specific animals and had the opportunity to touch them. They got to touch a monitor lizard, they got to touch a tortoise, and they got to touch a tarantula foot a low one, rather than a high five. All on all a very good time was had by all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M3995MIkimberlyj
50,Only available weekends,We made the mistake of just turning up midweek. Nothing they or we could do. Weekends only visit. It’s about 20 minute walk from Culver Hotel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPHWatford
40,Animal rescue,This location rescues wild animals and tries to restore them to health. The tour is very interesting. Lexey was an excellent guide and made us believe that she really cared for the various animals.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436hannahg
40,Exotic animal rescue,"This is an odd little rescue place, but fun to visit, and way better than a zoo. Star is basically a rescue for exotic animals. They get their animals when they are surrendered by owners, confiscated by fish and wildlife or border patrol. or from other rescues that need to transfer an animal. The facility is impressively built out of an industrial park building, with some outdoor spaces. Like another reviewer, I, too, have concerns about animals being crowded, or also lonely. But Star definitely has the knowledge to feed and care for the animals, and they fill an important function. Worth a tour with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaSPDX
40,"Rescued animals, but they need more space","Eco Station is doing important work by housing and caring for dozens of wild animals that needed homes and couldn’t be rehabilitated in the wild, ranging from a lynx and red fox to many macaws and cockatoos, fish and many, many reptiles. The animals really need more space though, when we were there there was a monitor desperately clawing at the floor of its enclosure trying to get out. I hope Eco Station will expand its operations and provide more space for its animals, even if that means reducing the parking lot. And some of the animals are up for adoption, so please visit if you are interested in helping rescued wild animals. My daughter really enjoyed it, I personally have a very hard time with animals in cages and tanks but this place is much better than the zoo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESAPorter
40,So much to see,"So I'm not just saying this because I used to teach for this company, but this place rocks!!! If you like to learn up close about the wonders of life great and small, this is the place to go! It's intimate and the people are dedicated to the great work they do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dar37
50,Fun and environmental awareness,"As the description at their site, they are ""an environmental science museum, an exotic wildlife rescue center, and a haven for endangered and illegally-trafficked exotic animals confiscated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service"". There are guided visits where you learn the story of how those animals ended up in there. Its an good attraction not only for kids, but for those who loves animals as well, because not only you can see the animals and touch some of them, but also the admission fee helps the station to keep doing their great job taking care of these animals",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/334lg
40,Fun for All Ages!,"This is such a fun place! The 1st time my then 3 year old visited, he was literally talking about this place for weeks! You get a guided tour through the facility, they tell you about the animals (and may even let you touch a couple!). This is a really enjoyable outing for kids and parents. The kids get to see so many different things including reptiles, birds, and even some mammals (we saw a bobcat!) I personally enjoyed hearing the backstories of how animals ended up at the Eco Station. It's also great for the kids to learn how to properly care for pets and take care of our environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
40,Fun for kids of all ages,We brought two little kids here and they had a good time.It's a wholesome activity for families. Adults on their own would be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roxskin
40,Odd but interesting,"This location is dedicated to educating the public about the ecosystems in the city. While it does have a number of animals and reptiles, there are several areas that provide information about saving our environment and protecting the ecosystems. This includes efforts to clean up beaches and local creeks. Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/411gennyd
50,Incredible !,"Just came back from a visit with a group of 19 students, an offering different than any zoo/ animals situation. The guide was the most entertaining and with a serious understanding of his wild bunch! We visited with students of all ages and for the hour and a half they were totally interested. A gem hidden in Culver City, may I mentioned a beautiful clean park a couple blocks ( easy walk) across the street where we had lunch under the shade of beautiful trees. GO !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyage8082
50,Save the animals,"This was an amazing tour to be able to see how they rescue animals that would otherwise not survive. We got to see dancing birds, a playful bobcat and learn about so many different animals. The center also is used to educate underprivileged children and has an exposed water system that shows them how littering can affect our water. Worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loripaolino
50,Great small animal rescue facility,"Great way to spend an hour and a half with young children to educate them about small animals - mainly reptiles, fish and birds, who have been rescued from the authorities or people who owned them illegally or no longer want them. Very educational and small enough for young children to see up close. Very nice people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracyd310
50,great visit for kids rather than the zoo!,"I have been there many times over the years when my son was younger. They host great little carnivals for Halloween, etc. There is a nominal fee and a guide takes a small group throughout the facility. They are given wildcats when found in the mtns. or lizards that people try to sneak into the country, etc. Many species to see up close and personal in a unique environment. I much prefer this concept to a zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisasM6143IH
30,Great for kids,definitely geared for kids. The tour guide was so animated it was hilarious!$8 for adultsEnter off of Jefferson on Pearson St. Tricky to find the first time.It's for a good cause so check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/photosbyalexandria
50,Hidden Gem,"The kids love this place! Educational and exciting, kids will love the large birds, reptiles, fish, and felines that this place has to offer. They even get to pet a reptile or two.... Which is always the highlight for my little ones. Nowhere near the size of a zoo, but definitely a more interactive experience than you would get at the zoo (without getting/paying for a private behind the scenes tour).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sweet_Pisces
50,A must see!,"This is the coolest place ever! So many amazing animals (like a mini zoo), fantastic for kids, and how can you not support a place that rescues animals? A must see/little gem in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DariaG368
40,You don't need to leave the city to see WILDlife,"The STAR ECO Station is NOT just for kids, but for anyone open to learning about the environment through the lives of endangered animals. The exotic animals at ""Eco"" are throw-a-ways, brought into the country illegally, too large to keep as pets (gee Mom, I really want one of those, PLEEEEZE).The knowledgeable guides describe not only what you are seeing in an enclosure but details and histories of the animals and why they are at ""Eco"" instead of where they really belong.There are camp program, big events and a number of other activities that add to the venue.Going on a weekend for a more intimate tour is the best way for first-times, a birthday party, fund-raising cocktail party or other activty is another way to help this amazing non-profit keep the animals alive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheEcoMom
40,A great find in Culver City,"I visited this place about a month ago, and was pleasantly surprised by all the wildlife that's available for public viewing. It pales by comparison to a zoo, but it's intimate, and the tour provided by the docents is very informative.Sadly, I wish they had a larger viewing area for the wild cats, as they are enclosed inside glass. It would be wonderful if you could see them jumping and enjoying the outdoors, and benefitting from the fresh air and sunshine.Good tribute to ecology as well. Parrots are quite lively...bring earplugs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grathy
50,wildlife rescue and kids museum,"cool spot for the kide,lots of info on things you can do,the best tour guides,to sum it up this place is for yhe kids the enviros and the gov.dinoman was one of the best shows I have taken the kids to in years,this place rocks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAKEBABE
