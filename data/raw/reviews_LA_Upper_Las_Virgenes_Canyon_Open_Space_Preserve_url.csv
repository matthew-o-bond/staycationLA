50,Nice hike,"A great place for a day hike. Good trails, good maps, and clean restrooms. Many trail options from easy to hard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donh941
40,"Open hills, loop trails","A drive in through some of the recent burned valley drops you atop the hills. There are no trees or shade along the trails, but you will get plenty of sunshine and breathing room. You also can get a bit of a view or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pickling
50,Easy Get Away,"This is green space that is close to a populated area, but still seems far away when you get on the trails. This is a good place to see wildlife. Multiple trails for hikers, trail runners, and bikes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulsa
50,"So remote, so close, rustic, and full of wildlife","So remote, so close, rustic, and full of wildlife. Trails are marked and others trail off on their own. Hard to really get lost. Just find a high point and get reoriented. Pack water and remain hydrated. Same with bring trail snacks and a sandwich. Do not rush. It is a great place for trail runs. But ignore that urge. This is truly a special place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Los Angeles Green Space,"So close to, and so far from, the bustle of greater Los Angeles. The city is fortunate to have preserved such incredible green space within its borders. Hikes here range from hilly walks to strenuous ascents. The views are spectacular, the vegetation and wildlife are abundant, and you might see dozens of folks or no one for hours. A great spot to clear the head and open the mind over the course of an hour or several.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381LarryM
50,Easy Getaway,"It is always amazing to me how far away from the city you feel when you explore this preserve. I run on the trails here a lot and there is peace and quiet (except for the occasional coyote howling), and lot of wildlife, including coyotes, deer and even a tarantula or two during the hot summer months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83deedeeu
50,Local West Valley Hiking,"This place is very close to where we live so we frequent this place. We go to El Scorpion Park on Vanowen and hike up from there. It's about a mile and a half to Victory Trailhead and once you reach there, you can take many different trails for miles. We have actually hiked over 10 miles roundtrip to Cheseboro and back. It's a gorgeous, green and rush during the winter and spring months. Summer and fall is a drab brown or yellow and is super dry. We've seen deer, coyotes, cottontail rabbits, gophers, bobcat, redtail hawks, and many lizards and frogs. It seems as though you are hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles but it's right in the West Valley. This place is a breath of fresh air. Best hiking in the West Valley for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
50,Great Hiking,Great place to hike. Keep dogs on leashes. Coyotes in the area are not afraid of you. Geocaching too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barthish
30,Lots of Twists And Turns,"If you're the kind of person who likes a surprise around each corner, this is the trail for you. With so many dips, rises, and turns around hills, that there were many delights and surprises. Took lots of pictures. I went after a long rainfall and it was fascinating to see how quickly all the water was absorbed by the earth. You could almost see the area getting greener.A couple of negatives: first, with such a beautiful location, why do sooo many people allow their dogs to crap on the trails without cleaning it up, or moving it off to the side? (jeez); second, why the poor signage? It was very difficult for newbies to guess where new trails started, and I spent an uncomfortable amount of time feeling lost and not trusting where I was heading. Very, very easy to fix. No reception for a good part of trail as well. Be prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbilmer
40,Ahmanson Ranch or ULVOSP?,"How in the world do you get to Upper Las Virgenes Open Space Reserve? How do you tell someone about it? Two words: Ahmanson Ranch. Is that the correct name? No. Not really but, it rolls off the tongue more easily.So... What can you do there? Hike, mountain bike, walk your dog (on a leash only,) bird watch, bring the kids and see some scenic California views as well as sweeping panoramas of the San Fernando Valley. There is currently no wheel chair access and only a pit toilet comfort station (at the Victory Blvd. Trail Head.) There is a rich history, however and it's been the scene of many a film shoot and commercial location.Access can be made through two basic points where ample parking exists (although many lesser known trails and access points also provide entry.)VICTORY TRAIL HEAD: You can enter most easily and directly by following Victory Blvd, west, until you reach the very end. The parking area will be obvious and you are encouraged to use it. Here is where you'll want to park if you're towing a horse trailer. The self-paid gravel parking lot happens to boast the LOWEST PARKING FEES in the state. This is to help reduce the number of people parking in the surrounding residential areas to avoid paying any fees. (C'mon. Really? It's $3! That's dirt cheap!)LAS VIRGENES TRAIL HEAD: An alternative way to access the park is from the 101 Freeway, exiting at the Las Virgenes exit and turning north on Las Virgenes to follow that to the end. While not an official parking lot, there are limited places to park for free to access the property. No bathrooms or wheel chair access exist here, so be forewarned.VAN OWEN AVENUE/EL SCORPION PARK:Just off the west end of Van Owen Avenue, another access point exists with very limited parking. This area is known to locals as El Scorpion Park.Each of these three points offers access to certain park features. Car access to the actual Ahmanson Ranch House does exist but it is strictly limited to use only during special events and weddings which take place at the otherwise off-limits, property.Seasons here bring interesting changes to the area and there is never really a bad time to come unless it is raining. In winter, there are many good days to hike or bike on the surrounding trails with cool, mild temps. Any season rainfall makes the hills green up instantly making for a scenic landscape or backdrop for a day outdoors. Spring, brings green, rolling hills and deep blue skies filled with birds and wildflowers can be found along the Las Virgenes and Bell Canyon fire roads. Summer turns the green into a golden, sun drenched savannah dotted with by the occasional oak tree. The heat can be excessive here in summer and you’ll want to prepare by bringing plenty of water. I have seen kites, owls, red-tailed hawks and many other amazing animals throughout the seasons. If you’re lucky, you’ll see deer grazing from the panoramic views surrounding Laskey Mesa or maybe even a coyote or two as they leap and dive to root for field mice. I’ve also encountered rabbits, rattle snakes, tarantulas and the iridescent blue wasp called, tarantula hawk here, as well. But don’t worry. Spotting these inhabitants is a rare and unusual treat. Just use caution, stay on designated trails and keep your dogs leashed for their own safety.Fire roads and foot trails zig-zag and meander throughout the property allowing multi-use for horses, mountain bikes and hikers. No motorized vehicles of any kind are allowed. Commercial photography and filming require a permit. Views of the greater San Fernando Valley can be had from certain vantage points throughout the park. Because the park is located near many homes, there are many people walking dogs. Dogs should be leashed here at all times. There are also trails closed to all traffic. Please respect signs and fences that mark these restoration areas and territories.Most importantly, this open space is a tremendous classroom. Visit at any age. Even if you don’t stroll deep into the park property, there is plenty to see at each point of access. Equestrian visitor already know many of this areas hidden secrets but if you are an experienced hiker or mountain biker, and are looking for a challenge, you can look at at any quality map of the Simi Hills area to see how this park connects to Cheeseboro/Palo Commado Canyons National Park. Getting there from say, the Victory trail head isn't far, depending on the trails you take, but there are steep climbs, creek crossings and a strong knowledge of the area is recommended.I can't stress enough that a few minutes of preparation can save hours of frustration - or worse. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat. Dress in layers. Be prepared for weather (it's usually warmer here than other LA locations. Park in the designated parking lot and most importantly, tell somebody where you're going and when you expect to be back. It's hard to believe someone could truly be lost so close to an urban setting - but do it anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Actual_User
