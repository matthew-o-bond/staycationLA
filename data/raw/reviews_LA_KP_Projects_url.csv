50,super experience,"simply one of the best galleries in town. they love their art and they love sharing it. I was lucky enough to meet Merry and she not only is very knowledgeable, but loves entertaining and sharing her culture. You can consider yourself lucky if you are in LA while they have an opening night. It's always very busy but basically tremendously worthwhile. Thank you again for all the help you gave me with art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satori99
