50,Perfect Place to Read,"This is a beautifully designed library in Orange County.CA. You are greeted by a massive aquarium as you go towards the main circulation section. It has three floors - and on third are meeting rooms designed for large groups that can be rented for a fee. There are smaller meeting rooms on the second floor that can reserved for free in 1 hour increments by patrons with library cards. The ground floor has a periodicals section by an artificial fireplace - a perfect place to catch up on current events and check e-mail. The only downside to the Cerritos Library is when school is off for the day. Cerritos High School is right across the street, and students literally flood the library starting at 2:30 pm during school days, making the library VERY NOISY.",Sonnymao

The rest of the library is amazing as well, the architects were not afraid to break apart the areas into their own themed exhibits and make great use of the large building. There is also a great free sculpture park just a block away from this place in addition to a fountain/dolphin sculpture kids can play in. So you can have some Sea World style fun for free and without the evil whale torture.",Brandon S

I grew up in Cerritos pre-fabulous library and was already impressed with an interim renovation that dramatically increased its offerings. Its most recent incarnation makes you think you walked into a cross between Wonderland and a Barnes & Noble. Grab a magazine from their extensive periodicals section and curl up for a bit in one of their many chairs. The unexpected and wall-sized aquarium in the children's reading section is amazing! This library alone will encourage you to pay taxes as a Cerritos resident to support such a great structure and public institution.",femalenomaddc

I've grown up in Lakewood/Cerritos. This is a great place for kids adults and teens. There are historical pieces, some art, and fun dolphin water fountains. as well as a cool looking pond fountain in the entrance walkway from the parking lot. The Cerritos Sherriff station is also located on the premises. And in the back corner to the right of the station is a serene and peaceful sculpture garden. I'd come here to sit and write AP essays in high school. It's a great free stop to enjoy especially on a hot summer day to cool down. Only bummer is that a library card for non-residents is a ridiculous fee the last time I checked around $100 (partly because some surrounding cities refused to help in the remodeling).

40,Amazing library except...,"Bar none the best public library I've ever been too. The beautiful aquarium that serves as a wall for the children's section. The high ceilings, and modern decorum makes one feel as if they've stepped into a library at USC as opposed to one in a small city like Cerritos. Well.... Except that there are many kids here hanging out. Which is both good and bad. Good for the kids actually studying. Bad for the ones who are making this amazing library turn into a teenage mall where it's kids talking at tables and goofing around. They do however have silent proof rooms that you can reserve days in advance.Overall, great place to study and find the books you'll need. If they could only find a way to keep this library from being a social hangout instead of the beautiful place to learn.",Jamez N

50,A library like no other,This is a beautiful library and the pride and joy of Cerritos. The children's section is beautiful and top of the line. They also have an area for a small parties/gatherings at a very reasonable price.,EVELIZ2013
50,A learning Center for all,"This library does not only have 100,000 books it is a learning center. Tell me of a library that has a fish tank, a space shuttle, a dinosaur, a rain forest, an old world book display, a teen library and over 300 computers. Art work that could be in any major museum. Conference rooms, a large meeting room and probably the most friendly staff. All of this is free. The children can spend hours in their section and now with the new teen studio and all that it has to offer, the Cerritos Library and it's titanium exterior is now a destination, Tour books suggest it, so will I",genealogygail
50,Pretty much the tops,"There's a huge fish tank in the lobby with a wide variety of salt water fish. In the children's library there is also a full size T-Rex skeleton. There's a bunch of little reading areas with soft chairs, and a large area for accessing the internet. No problem getting a card for when you need to print. They also do special programs up on the 3rd floor which are fun to attend. And the water fountains outside are fun for the kids to play in afterward to cool down.The parking is a little tight and hazardous.",htwh

50,State of the Art Library,"You consider yourself blessed when you have a ""guggenheim"" of a library in your backyard. Recently they had a Paper Tole Art Exhibit in the lobby right by the wall-size aquarium separating the elegant lobby entrance from an endearing child friendly library area featuring a lighthouse and dock right by a jungle book tree with animal sounds not far from a dinosaur and shuttle featuring small chilldsize desks. There are surprixes around every turn. I love this library, specially my little nook by the fireplace. And I love the gift shop where I got many of my art books and bestsellers, not to mention my wind-up toy collectibles. So happy it is in my neighborhood",LizC2012
50,They still have books,"This is more of a learning center, an incredible library. You walk into the library and see a huge fish tank, filled with fish from all over. There are 2 sides to the tank, coastal and reefs. In the children's library you have a light house, a space shuttle, banyan trees, and dozens of computers and of course books. The library is divided into sections where you have the old world with many classic leather cover books, a new teen area lounge and over 200 computers throughout. Incredible art work and the most incredible helpful staff. Come visit Cerritos",genealogygail
50,Absolutely beautiful library.,"Cerritos has a great tax base owing to the huge auto mall and the Cerritos Shopping Mall and the revenue was wisely used to build one of the most beautiful public libraries around. Huge shark tank at the entrance, tiered public computer area with ergonomic mesh-back chairs, and gorgeous wooden book shelves. Staff is friendly and helpful. Great place to spend a few hours.",VA_TDH
