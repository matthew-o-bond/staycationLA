50,Excellent Ciders and Meads,Our friends pointed us in the direction of Honest Abe’s. I love cider and many breweries don’t make any. I was not disappointed! The cider selection was great and the meads were delicious! It was a great stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/347christif
50,Cider & Mead Flights,"Been here twice already, 4/15/18 & 4/21/18.Hard to find location, use your nav. For you first time folks, this place is located in an industrial area in Carson, south of Victoria, and the east side of Main Street. The location is on the left side (north)of the building.Street parking.Served by Josh who is knowledgeable about the cider, mead and brews. Super nice guy and helpful.Taco man on Tuesdays, and Free Pizzas and movies on Friday.I ordered their cider flight ($14) and mead flight ($18) and also purchased a bottle of their Cherry Brandy.Small cozy place, with sofas, ping pong table. Nice spot to chill.No food served here, but they have a food delivery iPad by the counter for delivery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blue_wahine
50,Mostly cider but some wine too.,"Not an easy place to find. It is hidden the an industrial complex (on the north side of building 100) but worth the driving around in circles. The owner Spencer greater us. We were the only customers. We tried one tasting of each of he ciders and meads. All were good, some better than others. The Honey mead was my favorite and had to get some to go. The place has a cool vibe to it. We relaxed and enjoyed our drinks. The hours they are open are limited but I plan to return if it works into my schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/igormilewski
