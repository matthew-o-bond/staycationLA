50,Walt's Carolwood Barn,"Walt's Barn is a living showcase of Walt's passion for railroading. Operated by the non-profit Carolwood Foundation, Walt's Barn is filled with trains of all scales, many of which were donated to the Foundation by his animators and friends that shared his hobby. Many of Walt's personal items and tools are on display.Walt's Barn is generally open every 3rd Sunday of the month from 11:00 AM to 3:00 PM, subject to change without notice. They often have meet and greet sessions out there, the day we attended we got to meet Margaret Kerry. Who is this you may ask, Margaret was the inspiration for Tinker Bell.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874
50,A Free Disney Attraction,"There are two main sections at L.A. Live Steamers, riding the miniature trains and the Disney Barn and they have separate entrances and it is better to use the separate parking lots. The Barn is free, but there can be a line. As my luck usually runs, we waited about a half hour and there was no line as we exited. This is the barn that Walt had built at his home and used to build and maintain his large scale backyard model railroad. The barn was based on a barn from one of his animated works and had built-in sag to look old. Once inside, the barn is filled with trains, Disney memorabilia, and a model of the Mine Train ride that was removed from Disneyland long ago. A few steps away is one of the railroad cars used when Disneyland opened. Not bad for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Combine a Visit with Travel Town - Only 3rd Sundays of Month,"Walt's Barn is located in the north end of Griffith Park between Travel Town and the zoo. Note that it is only open on the 3rd Sunday of each month between 11:00 and 3:00. The barn is Walt Disney's workshop from his residence, where he enjoyed working on a scale model railroad in his backyard. The barn has been moved to Griffith Park and is now a mini-museum with photos and displays about Walt's hobby and the Disneyland Railroad. Other railroad enthusiasts who worked at Disney have contributed to the exhibits. The Los Angeles Live Steamers have built an educational display about steam engines as well. You can take a ride around the grounds on a sit-on train (fee). We enjoyed visiting this attraction after touring Travel Town, but the barn is small and there were a lot of people crowded in a small area. There was a queue and wait to see it. Children will probably get more out of the train ride than the historic Disney displays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
