50,Cathedral like and classical awe,"An entrance that is exquisitely embellished with scholarly and classical references is just one of the great architectural features in stone.Symbols of learning such as the classics, science, astronomy and mathematics adorn an arc over the doorway. Within the arc is wonderful braiding with a centrepiece of two scholars on each side of an owl of wisdom.Completed in 1929, the name honours Lawrence Powell who was UCLA Librarian for 17 years from 1944.Inspired by the styling of Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan it houses a tremendous collection of books and manuscrips, in additional to being a grand legacy from UCLAâ€™s early days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
