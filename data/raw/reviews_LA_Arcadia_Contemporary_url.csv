30,Beautiful paintings but poor management,"The gallery owner and assistant were very rude, aloof and brusque.They ignored me when I walked in(nobody else was there). When I asked questions; they also acted like they couldn't be bothered. The Gallery is also poorly designed and setup. It just feels like being in a small warehouse/storage room with no energy and personality. It could also use some seats for customers.On the plus side, I was very impressed with the quality/creativity of the paintings/artists. The works are very well done and well painted.Prices are also reasonable.So atmosphere/staff gets 2 stars and paintings 5 for a 3 star result.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltime111
