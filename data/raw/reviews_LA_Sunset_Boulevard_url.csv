40,Exploring solo,"I found Sunset Boulevard very peaceful and quite right after exploring Hollywood famous ""Walk of Fame"". I had a very nice memory while walking down the road of Hollywood Boulevard in the early summer of April 2019. I found a guy who was taking care of his friend’s nursery. The garden owner went outside Hollywood for an important job to attend. I introduced myself as a solo traveler to the gardener, I don’t remember his name though, but he reciprocated well with me in return. Our momentary friendship was bonded with a smile which reflected on our faces that will never be seen in our lifetime ever again for sure. It’s a strange world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smshossain

40,Iconic Sunset Strip !,"No trip to Los Angeles would be complete without a visit to Sunset Strip ! We visited as part of a city tour and unfortunately tour buses are not allowed to stop, so we had to take in the main sights as we drove through. Well worth a visit to see sights such as Viper Room, Whiskey a Go-Go, Sunset Strip Tattoo, and Chateau Marmont. The interesting juxtaposition of high end boutiques, hotels, and restaurants with rather shabbly stores and garages is quite suprising.

My suggestion is that you take an hour or more to drive from Hollywood all the way to the Pacific Coast Highway and stop and visit sites along the way. You will go through a variety of sections of LA that will give you a feel for the diversity and amazing opportunities LA provides, from Sunset Strip to UCLA. Slow down, take your time and enjoy all of the diversity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB

50,Marvellous drive.,"Sunset Boulevard is such an iconic street that the fun is worth all the drive. It goes on and on and on and you have glimpses of the mansions that are set behind the imposing gates. You also go trough the iconic LA “areas”: Bel Air, Beverly Hills, etc.If you leave the Boulevard and venture on the side streets uphill the view is getting better and the houses are still magnificent.Worth the effort of taking a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelaround59

30,Meh with Occasional Glimpses of Wow,"Sunset Blvd must have been something. It was still something about ten years ago. A place where rock bands played and paid to be discovered. It's the only place I know where bands pay to play or guarantee so many in attendance. You will see where River Phoenix tragically died outside at that time Johnny Depps Viper Room, you should stop at the Guitar Center and see their walk of fame, if you're into theatre go to Samuel French's which is where all the actors go to shop. It used to be so much more fun as many of the rock venues have gone. The rainbow room is still going and the Comedy Store is still going and still good. Greenblatts deli is also good to eat. Whilst on sunset take a brief detour to Mashti Malone's ice cream as they have truly unique homemade ice cream. Sunset still has some decent restaurants near where Tower records used to be and if you're feeling horny baby then you can stop at the Hustler store. Sunset for me nowadays is where you drive and stop at what interests you as well as looking at the Huge billboards that adorn part of the street. It's not a must go to destination anymore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB

30,Nice to drive but I expected more....actually not sure what I expected,"Sunset Boulevard is well known all over the world. Most because of the movies off course and Beverly Hills being linked to it. So, my expectations were high. To high maybe. There was not really much to see. I must say it was very clean though. Lots of Palm trees and so. Very nice boulevard. There was also much space for the pedestrians. But like I said before: I expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickd401
50,See the Sunset,"The best way to see Sunset Blvd is to start at the beginning in Downtown LA, at Figueroa St, and go West until you reach the Beach (a very nice one). You can park (for a fee) in Gladstones and walk the sands, at Sunset of course. In between Downtown and PCH is a fascinating tour of Hollywood, going past the Whisky a Go Go and many other clubs, Beverly Hills, seeing all the movie star mansions, Westwood, home of UCLA, Brentwood, where many stars live today, and Pacific Palisades, where many stars still live. Take your time, take a tour bus, take the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marklG8499ME

It links Hollywood to Beverly Hills so it's a definite feature on almost any city tour you might do.We went back on foot and found it to be a vibrant, bustling, energetic place full of fantastic eateries. There is a good nightlife too and it's well worth spending a bit of time hehte, even if, like me, you're not particularly into shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bozeman-Dublin

50,Walk from Hollywood to Beverly Hills,"I took a long, long walk (I didn't realise how long) from Hollywood & Vine down to Sunset Boulevard and walked all the way from the Palladium Theatre to Beverly Hills which encapsulates Sunset Strip. On the way you see chic restaurants & cafes in one area, funky bars and hangouts in another and you also pass some pretty down and out dives and places on the way where only the fallen would spend a lot of their time (given the length of Sunset Blvd you cross through various “neighbourhoods”).Along the way you get to see some iconic places such as The Viper Room, Whiskey A-Go-Go, Comedy Store, ArcLight & Amoeba Music (further down on the Hollywood end of the Blvd), Hollywood High School, Chateau Marmont and others. There are also plenty of places to grab refreshments along the way and there are some shopping options as well (trust me if you are on foot you will need a few stops!).I would point out that walking is a significant commitment (both in terms of time and energy!). It's a long street, but I wouldn't have done it any other way as you get a real feel for the area which you would definitely miss by just turning up to certain places along the Strip. I was keen to spot a celebrity but alas my hopes were dashed. But rest assured they are around so you may be lucky!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorldTravla7
40,Great drive,"I love the buzz of Los Angeles apart from the traffic. However Sunset boulevard has a magic about it. is a long road which has so many bars and hotels and clubs and is iconic in its own right.

Some of it has been developed and there's plenty of touristy shops and malls that you have to see past to catch some of the old history and magicIt's hot busy and overwhelmed with tourists but that's inevitable. Still worth exploring on footGo later in the afternoon and avoid the heat or pick a rainy day if that happens and it will be less crowded,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrNic1
50,Great history and atmosphere,The walk down Sunset Boulevard (the main drag that includes the Viper Room etc) is really worth doing. There are some shops to pop in and out of but it's the history of the buildings which is worth it. You can print off a guide from the internet before you go which explains the significance of each place. For a snack stop I'd recommend Saddle Ranch and there's also a great bookshop on the Strip too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cheesecake0509
30,REAL HOLLYWOOD,"While this is interesting for the first time visitor and maybe for some history/trivia buffs most of you will find this area to be dirty, crowded and overpriced. I have taken may folks down along this boulevard and their comments are interesting (every thing from shock to disbelief) It is fun to note where the Hollywood walk of fame starts and ends (YES, not everyone is in a prime location). Be Careful in this area as thieves love tourists and patrol this area like a bear during trout season. Sometimes it is interesting when it is not crazy busy to come down here and observe scam artist at work. Not to sound totally negative on this area, there is history down in this area and interesting things to observe, but note that traffic in this area during high season can be brutal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heumanntouch

30,"Old, hot and barren","Hollywood boulevard was old and in dire need of a touch up, with explosions of tourists and awful traffic and I did wonder why I walked 5km to see a couple of stars on the floor at the Chinese theatre. ITs strange to seat all slammed up for awards on TV but in reality its what goes on around which is disappointing. I suppose its just a process that has happened for the last 50 years when it comes to openings and celeb sightings.I couldn't bare to bother with Madam Tussauds, tourists shops or the usual tourist hotspots and decided to grab an Uber which is super easy to grab in LA, and head to Beverley Centre which apparently is the biggest shopping mall with everything you can imagine.Beverley Centre- DON'T GO AT THIS TIME.It's all boarded up , I believe I heard it was all the F and B outlets. Inside was quiet and the shops were separated by construction which didn't do much to the atmosphere and after 2 shops I left and Uber'd to Venice Beach Pier.Venice Beach PIER - DO VISIT THE BEACHESThe atmosphere was a lot more cheerful, there isn't much to do except take wonderful sundown photos at 8pm at night, walk the wonder line of the beach, and make sur eye leave room for food.Plenty of beach food, hotdogs, burgers, famed Bubba Shrimp and various other wonder restaurants in the area.MERCADO restaurantDINNER- Not far from venice go to eat at MERCADOAmazing tapas Mexican styled plates.a very varied menu and something for everyone!SALT AND STRAW ICE CREAM- dessertMy friend bought me at 10 pm at night and the fast moving queue was out the door, it was amazing and the smells capture yo the moment you get 15m within sight. the allow you to try anyone you want as well with spoon samples!Exquisite!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClaireJedrek

Sunset Boulevard is a very long road but there are some sections that are worth driving and for us stopping and taking a walk. One such section takes in a small part that has a couple of coffee shops and the viper room (club where River Phoenix died outside).

40,Walk down the strip!,"Depending on which part of Sunset Blvd you are walking... if you're walking on Sunset between Vine and La Brea the only cool things to do and checkout is by Sunset and Vine. There are a good amount of food places and it's pretty cool to walk around.Another good place to walk is on Sunset around West Hollywood area. This is on Sunset Blvd between la Cienega and San Vicente streets, there are a lot of restaurants, shops and bars around this area and cool hotel to hangout to. I suggest asking locals on where to go since they always will tell you where to go which most locals go. I hope you have a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alaindl
40,A neat snapshot of Los Angeles,"We drove the length of Sunset a couple of different times on our L.A. trip. It's completely different during the day versus at night. So much to see, so many iconic L.A. hotspots. A guided tour might be better if you prefer them as it's easy to miss things while driving yourself. The lights at night are really cool and give it a totally different vibe. If you are into sightseeing, this should be high on your list. If you have time, definitely stop and check out some of the stores, clubs, etc... up close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsW93
30,LA Drive,"We drove down Sunset while in LA and it was interesting to see the various landmarks. It was quite crowded. If pressed for time, recommend driving like we did and not spend time trying to find parking and walking around. There are better spots in LA to do this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmacwi
40,You must cruise Sunset Blvd,"We drove Sunset in our car rental and it was beautiful, but it was much better in the guided tour as all the celebrity hotspots were revealed.If you have time, then you should probably check out Chateau Marmont!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep_girl_00
40,View of Hollywood Sign,"If you're in LA, you simply must drive down Sunset Boulevard. There are so many iconic things that you can see - best of all is the view of the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
40,Definitely worth a drive along if it means something to you,"Drove it a few times as a deliberate slightly longer detour to our place we were staying, and it is good to see a few of the locations that hold some cultural or historical significance to you. So, for that, it is recommended. If there was nothing of meaning to you, then it would be pretty pointless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter
50,I'm ready for my closeup: SUNSET BLVD the movie,"You don't have to be 'ready' for anything except a great travelexperience: you can't cover all of Sunset Blvd in one day-itgoes from the Ocean to the Train station in downtown L.A.But you can pick out the areas you want to visit, whether its the previously mentioned or UCLA or the Beverly Hills Hotel ofthe area where the hippies of the 60's hung out, where the GTO's and other rock stars could be found at the WhiskeyA Go Go and you can stop and have a meal at any number of restaurants. Guitar Center is located on Sunset Blvd,you can take the bus to Highland and then walk north 2 blocks to hollywood blvd nd go t the Walk of Fame passing Hollywood High or you could go to Amoeba records or you could justgo to the Olevera St. which is at the end of the Blvd, for someauthentic Mexican cuisine and culture. It's not RODEO DRIVEbut it has a charm that is totally unique to LA and authentic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
20,Drive don't walk,"I wasn't impressed with this area, great to drive through and experience, but I'm not sure why you would want to walk along the pavement?This area was probably once the in place to be, and be seen; no longer. This is now just for tourists with very little else to appeal or make people come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScampinIzzy
40,Nice drive. The roads are...,This was a very nice drive however the roads were horrible. I am shocked that the owners of new cars would even want to drive on these roads.Triple Forks Hunting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripleforkshunting
20,Crowded,It's a very traditional street in Los Angeles but it's always so crowded that I wouldn't recommend anyone to go unless they had visited other spots of the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taniar647

40,must see,"Its an iconic long street. We drove along the street and saw many iconic signs, otels, buildings etc. Driving along is not enough, get off the car and walk a bit, you will love it. There is also a street you can see hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191semiha
40,small,"Being a size 18+ I found it very hard to find something nice to buy here in my size. For a country of large size people that's not good.I found it boating but then I found something to fit me.hooray, a scalf and it still fits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W1060UClynnc
50,Driving Sunset Blvd,"We had to drive along Sunset Blvd and see all the movie signs, iconic hotels and bars as well as all the other sights and sounds of this iconic road. You have the Chateau Marmot, the Viper Room, the Rainbow and The Whiskey a Go Go. You'll notice many movie scenes were shot along the drive as well as the huge signs for new movies and TV series.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanTeddyBear
30,A nice walk,"We took a stroll down Sunset Boulevard last week. In my humble opinion there wasn't much to see, some chockie stores, hotels etc. Although you could see the Hollywood sign from certain areas. We enjoyed the busyness of Hollywood blvd better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2He
50,"Iconic Sunset Blvd With Characters, Restaurants and Stars","If you haven't been to LA, you should spend an hour or two on Sunset Blvd. Sunset to Vine is quite a walk, but doable. I recommend walking part of it and driving the rest. Be aware that the meters run late-night and the tickets are hefty. They are quick to give a ticket, too. You will find some great shopping, iconic clubs and great restaurants. From The Viper Room to The Whiskey a Go Go. You can even have laser hair removal if you so choose. You'll notice many movie scenes were shot along the drive. It's a bustling area, but you can find a nice place to have a drink or a meal along the way at one of the great restaurants. Unfortunately, you are no longer able to see a show at the House of Blues because it is now closed. I recommend buying tickets for one of the famous comedy clubs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Outofdodge_10
50,If You are A Tourist It is One Your Must List,"Sunset Blvd. starts at the beach and goes all the way to Downtown Los Angeles, but you will not be picking it up there. You will either grab it off the 405 freeway or on Doheny Drive and take that a bit past Vine Street to get all that the Strip has to offer.The drive is very crowded so be patient but there is a lot to see. If you start on Doheny, you will be at the start of the Strip.You will see great places to eat, shops and of course The Whiskey and other famous bars that have great music. You can park around The Whiskey and walk or just drive the entire Strip.It is fun, especially at night. Again it is crowded, but that is okay. It is fun and if you are visiting Los Angeles, you must go.Now, if you are walking, your wallet, day or night, is in your front pocket and no you don't want to buy a watch.It is well patrolled and safe, with the above note. Also, don't even think of having a drink or 3 and driving. First, that makes you an idiot and second you will be stopped and to jail you will go and your car will be towed.Have a great time. The locals are friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Some interesting sights,Passing through and not expecting to see much - it was a nice surprise and a good tick in the box exercise to see some of the famous buildings on this road. Viper lounge etc...Very busy road in general and lots of tour busses that can get in the way of photographs. Best to park and walk for the full experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
40,Just passing through makes you want to see more.,"It brings you back to scenes of different movies you have watch in the big screen or tv. You feel like you have just been added to movie itself and want to jump out of your car and be a part of it. Plethora of people of different ethnicities just show you how we can all live together in harmony. I would just walk around all day, and always find something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/331CarolB
40,Quick Drive Down Sunset Blvd.,Another must do when visiting LA!! Take a pic driving down the road. Looks like TV with the palms lining the street. Pretty fancy cars too!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boyz4Us
50,Loved it,"A pleasant drive in hire car , even went down some back streets looked at some of the mansions and all the Mexican gardeners everywhere a culture shock coming from Aus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DWgoldengrove
50,Another LA street you have to visit,"We drove down Sunset as a part of our Hollywood tour. While the view is not the same with new obstruction, the legendary venues of comedy and music are still there as well as other iconic landmarks. The Laugh in, Whiskey a Go Go, Chateau Marmont make this street a historical reference for much in the various entertainment industries. I was glad we were able to drive it. You should too when you visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
30,disappointing,"Nothing much exciting to see really, it only gets interesting as you drive away from all the tourist places and you start heading into Bel air. We discovered Westwood village which was a great suburb away from all the hype and busy streets. Some great places here to eat and drink, and so relaxed you could almost forget you were so close to such a manic city centre. Nightmare for driving. In fact LA is just a complete nightmare for driving around. We won't be returning any time soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yoyo237
50,Expensive,Another place not to miss. The streets line with expensive stores and cars parked out front. Don't miss this either.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaysI7849ER
40,"Been there, done that","Sunset Boulevard is another one of those ""must do"" things when in LA. I wouldn't bother doing the entire 35 kms though. Just a short drive through Hollywood and Beverley Hills (my favorite part) is enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/641steveb
10,Go there only to check the block,"I've taken visiting family and friends here many times. This is not what you think it should/could be. It's dirty, rundown, unsafe, smelly, unpatrolled(!!!), and you won't see a single movie star unless you happen to be there during a movie kickoff event. Otherwise, it's just a tourist trap overrun by a concentration of the worst elements of society. You'll get hounded by vagrants, panhandlers, filthy superheroes, fake ""musicians"" selling blank CDs, and countless tour bus sales people...all while enjoying the environment of urine odors/stains and third rate shops and restaurants. So if you're really intent on seeing some sidewalk stars, you're at least now armed with my precautions. The city has failed to make this what it was intended to be. It's well overdue for a cleanup, some proper licensing requirements, and enforceable standards that remain enforced by a continuous police presence. If LA wanted to make it fun and clean, they'd dress the enforcers in movie attire with LAPD arm bands: cowboy sheriffs, storm troopers, ""mall cop"" on segue, etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,At the top,"When you look at the list of must do's this is one of them.Lots of recognizable places are on this street. Nothing like stopping to eat here and people watch. Walk, drive or bike, Sunset Boulevard must be on list of must sees",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression
40,Iconic strip...but not exciting anymore,"Again...This was one of those super hyped areas that disappoints you. The fault lies within..Having grown up on a liberal dose of Hollywood movies, sunset boulevard occupies a huge space in my mind. But the real boulevard did not live up to the movie counterpart.It's a row of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, liquor stores and other small shops. Good for driving through in the evening. A drive during dusk enhances the charm as the sky is filled with hues of orange and red.The rest, is plain ordinary. It's a good place to be in if you live in the vicinity..not as a tourist",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania
30,Sunset Blvd has its average and its way above average sights.,"Driving along Sunset Blvd, you can find yourself in areas that do not appeal to you, or others that do. Wooded residential areas, high end shopping areas plus plenty of city blocks on Sunset. Beverly Hills is the nicest area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
40,Sunset driving in sunset boulevard!,I drove sunset boulevard during sunset on a sunday evening and it was beautiful. It was like a movie! Beautiful scenery and a nice drive!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/103vicky
40,Not What it Was but still wonderful,"Sunset Blvd was once peppered by a vast assortment of wonderful nightclubs that were the ""in spots"" for celebrities and the well-suited Angelenos. Although it doesn't have the same charm it once did, it is still a very interesting place and one that should be experienced. Several clubs from the 70's and 80's still remain and many good restaurants can be enjoyed along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
20,Not Impressed,"Sunset Blvd is one of the storied streets in Los Angeles. But to us, it was just another decaying strip of liquor stores and low-rent night clubs and bars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineauxAlexandria
40,Take your time,"Most visitors concentrate on the stars' names on the sidewalk. I found that while it's interesting, it was more fun to look in all the store windows. There a re the mundane of every store, and there a re the outstanding things that are different. Most businesses will take the time to periodically change their displays which makes the walk more interesting. Take time for your walk. No need to hurry. If you did, there is a lot you would miss.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manay
50,"Amazing, don't walk though.","It's amazing and has more glamour than Hollywood Blvd. But don't walk it, it's very long. It's fun to drive, and if you go into Beverly Hills, don't be upset when you see so many fences around rich houses, famous people usually don't like to be disturbed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DragonFruit85
50,Iconic Sunset Strip with designer shops & giant billboards!,"If you can tolerate the traffic, driving the Sunset Strip is a fun & FREE way to drink in the flavor of Los Angeles, West Hollywood & Beverly Hills. The western part of the boulevard (roughly from Crescent Heights west to Doheny Drive) boasts trendy boutique hotels, upscale nightclubs, glamorous designer stores & (mostly pricey) restaurants.One of my favorite restaurants (and probably about the cheapest) is the famous Carney's, which is housed in a real railroad car on the north side of this section of Sunset. It serves mostly burgers, hot dogs, fries & the like (the chili-cheese burgers are GREAT) & the railroad car setting is fun.There are more reasonably priced restaurants & all the usual fast-food joints around Crescent Heights & further east.Driving and/or strolling down the world-famous Sunset Strip costs nothing, as is the interesting window-shopping & people-watching here. So a tourist can experience the glamour of Los Angeles without investing a huge amount of time or money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941evanb
20,Boulevard Not for Walking,"I don't know if I speak for most people, but when I hear ""boulevard"" I understand ""walking street"". Apparently not here. There is absolutely no reason to walk through Sunset Boulevard, because there's little to see, walking is not pleasant (street not meant for walking), and because it's a very long street—even the iconic section is (IIRC) over 10 km long!So what is there on Sunset Boulevard? Some wealthy people live in this area, and there are some buildings that have significance to Hollywood. I probably missed most of the significance, but even the stuff you'll probably think of seeing is all walled off—rich people don't like tourists taking pictures of their houses, so you'll mostly be seeing green garden walls on both sides.If you're going from LA to Santa Monica or vice versa, as a tourist it might be interesting to drive through this particular street and not some other one, but that's really where the fun ends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
30,Drive don't walk,"This is fun if you want to get to your next attraction in an interesting way. There really is no place that demands you stop or get out and walk and soak up atmosphere. If you are interested in the music scene then the few blocks in West Hollywood is worth the stop. The Rainbow, The Whiskey, The Viper Room are all there. The Hotel Bel Age might be interesting to some but it's really just a street. The best use of Sunset Blvd is to drive the full length of it in one direction or another, That's when you get the full picture of the diversity of LA. My favorite is Vermont and Sunset (though you can start as far east as downtown) west to the beach. THAT is some unique LA site seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyQM
20,Wasn't impressed,"It's suppose to be a super iconic boulevard, but there really isn't much to see. It kind of feels like a typical street that you'd find in the suburbs. And if you're walking, be prepared to feel weird because there are literally no pedestrians -- everyone is in a car!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardsmyname
30,"tasteless to eat, but a waste to throw away","It's obviously a must see in L.A, but honestly it's a very touristic site. Apart from the famous star walk, hand prints and foot prints, all you can see are fake superman and the 'future to be' famous musicians. But it's a great place to go if you want to buy souvenirs and take photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winnie9r
40,Great spot...........,We really enjoyed our drive down Sunset Blvd. Lots of nice houses and nice landscaping. Gives you a feel of the wealth of Hollywood! Worth the time if you have some to spare when in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler06232009

10,Overrated and Disapointing,"We drove down Sunset boulevard, excited that we had finally made it to LA and Hollywood. I am not sure what we expected but it turned out quite a different experience to the one we envisaged. I drive down searching for a reason to park up and explore - it never happened. Unfortunately the road was dirty and completely lacking in character. I tried to work out what the hype was about that made this such an iconic boulevard - and I still can't work it out!I suggest driving down it to say you have and don't bother stopping - it would be a waste of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarmaladeFella
30,Not what I was expecting...,"I had no idea what was on this road, but it wasn't what I was expecting!!The part we walked on I didn't feel too safe to be honest, the part we drove on was better.Like a lot of what we've seen in 'Hollywood', small patches of good viewing mixed with some not so good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaroleScott
30,It´s ok! We just drive by the blvd!,"There is nothing much to see than a simple street full of bar o theaters, some restaurants... nothing else. there was nothing more to see.

30,Pretty drive - but tough to take it in when you're the driver,"Sunset was a curve infested and very scenic route, taking us right by UCLA campus. It's hills, dips, and curves nearly made my passengers car sick - but sites, houses, and history was pretty cool. Wouldn't go out of my way to drive it again, but would enjoy it if I found myself traveling on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayhawkJim

There are night clubs here, hotels, restaurants, fitness centers, trendy clothing shops, beautiful homes, and so much more.The real stand out here is the pink palace known as ""The Beverly Hills Hotel."" This is where many famous people have stayed. It is famous for it's bungalows.The metro buses go down Sunset Boulevard so you can hop off and on the bus and not worry about driving in traffic and finding a parking spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriannaA_12

Whiskey wasn't open cause it had a band.. the Viper room had a band but it cancelled. We ended up eating and hanging out at the Rainbow Room, which was very cool..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahHiscock
40,"Interesting, weird, touristy.","Okay, so Sunset Boulevard needs to be seen...one time. Once you've been there, you've seen it, and that's it. It is quirky, funny, and interesting, but it's also crowded and touristy. I've been there a bunch of times (taking different people), and it's pretty much always the same now, and it's not as fun as it was in the 80s. Back then, you could go to Mann's Chinese theater (I have no idea what it's called now), go to some gritty shops and see your Walk of Fame favorite. Now, it's touristy and commercial and doesn't have the ""charm"" it used to. it does, however, still have some grit, as just this summer, we witnessed an older woman pull down her pants and pee in a hole on a street just off the main drag. So, things like that happen on Sunset Boulevard. Like I said, one time, and you're good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mommabiek

50,My favorite street in LA,"I recommend to out of towners that they start at Olvera Street (at the east end of Sunset, now called Cesar Chavez) for brunch. Travel west on Sunset past Dodger Stadium through Echo Park and Silverlake, stopping for coffee at one of the many hipster cafes, and then on to Los Feliz and Hollywood. Stop somewhere for lunch and shopping perhaps in Beverly Hills, and keep going through Brentwood and finally Pacific Palisades. End at Gladstones on the beach for happy hour drinks and seafood and reliably spectacular sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaKellyMartin

20,Not what it used to be,A trip down Sunset Boulevard will provide you with a variety of shops and restaurants but it is not nearly what it was years ago. Don't take a lot of your time here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,You can't go to LA and not go to Sunset !,"An awesome drive, great sites, classic LA. Hotels, clubs, restaurants, history and people watching at it's finest",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PW11803
40,A must-do legendary drive while in LA,"If you are a movie fan - and even if you are not - the very name Sunset Boulevard conjures up images of old Hollywood, star glamour and the postcard image of LA you have always had in your mind. This iconic boulevard is actually quite long and worth doing in the early evening as the sun is setting in the distance and lights are coming on in the stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripasucks
40,Ride Sunset from PCH to the Hills ..,"Sunset Boulevard is an iconic name and an iconic paved strip across LA from West to East. For fun start where Sunset Blvd. starts - at the beach PCH / Hwy. 1 in Pacific Palisades, and then head east through the Palisades, Brentwood, Westwood, Bel-Air, Holmby Hills, Bevery Hills, W. Hollywood, Hollywood into LA proper. It's a neat drive which pits the name and place to lots of LA & it's sub cities. Cruise Sunset & enjoy! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Good for a first timer,"It is always worth seeing the iconic Strip but once is most likely enough and then move on to more interesting, less touristy stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thelinmd
30,It was Ok.,I went on a tour through Sunset Blvd and was not too impressed. Not sure if it was because we were on a tour and not really stopping or if it was just not impressive to me. There are plenty of diners and stores to visit though. Do check it out you may like it better than I did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432reneef
30,Not impressed,Most of these shops can be found in malls now so the idea of walking up and down a very crowded street doesn't impress me. I saw very few people actually IN the stores. Most were out taking pictures of the stores and walking by. How do they pay their leases? No one buys.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/15LisaT
50,Sunset Strip Rocks!!!!,"Made the mistake of trying to wing a hotel room during the Special Olympics, and during our search, got veryfamiliar with Sunset Blvd.The energy is amazing, and the shopping options ranged from touristy to great local.I enjoyed Sunset way more than Hollywood Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672manuelq
30,"Unmissable, but unexciting","You can't go to LA and not go to Sunset Boulevard. It is the birthplace of Hollywood. It is a collection of street performers and people trying to sell you stuff. Good for about an hour of your time, plus a hills tour. If you drive here prepare to pay through the nose for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanetreloarofficial
30,"Go see it, to say you did it, nothing more than that...","Basically the only reason to visit (in my opinion) is to say that you have done it. During the day, the street is not the nice looking street you see on TV. Been there, done that...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dany_C_71
30,Good place to wander around for an hour or so,"It's a must see place in LA, though you wont need more than an hour or so there. There isn't much to do besides having a bite to eat and then some shopping. Not as touristy as Hollywood Boulevard, and a different feel which was a nice change from all the hustle and bustle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/belweckert
50,Los Angeles' Amazing Drive,"For most, Sunset Boulevard conjures up visions of Gloria Swanson, or Kooky combing his hair, or hippies on the famous stretch known as The Strip. But a trip down Sunset is much, much more. It is a fascinating journey through Los Angeles' unique landscape. Lacing along the northern foothills, begin downtown at Olvera Street, the colorful little pueblo where Los Angeles began and then head west to the Pacific Ocean. Along the way you'll pass Dodger Stadium, the hip Silverlake District, then East Hollywood. To your left you'll pass streets full of businesses and thriving barrio neighborhoods, to your right, in the hills, the vast ribbon of expensive homes that will accompany all the way to the beach. Farther west you'll travel through the heart of Hollywood, then West Hollywood, LA's tony, gay neighborhood, then down through the exciting Sunset Strip and out into Beverly Hills, where magnificent mansions line both sides of the street. A little further on, you'll pass Westwood, home of UCLA, and chic, mega wealth, Bel-Air. Crossing over the 405 Freeway, Bel-Air will give way to equally wealthy and leafy Pacific Pallisades with its own impressive estates. As you travel farther, you will begin a curving drive down to Pacific Coast Highway, the end of your drive, where you will see the white sands Santa Monica Bay and, beyond the sea, the sun set over the infinite horizon. All along the boulevard you'll find great eating, great shopping, colorful people, iconic architecture, lush landscapes, fancy automobiles, and a famous slice this vast metropolis.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcimayerson
30,Just okay,Very interesting characters walking around. Not for the weak or with sensitive noses. I enjoyed the shops and clubs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjw1351
10,Traffic experience,"It's just of many roads with lots traffic, not that interesting, name sounds amazingly good however it's not well kept, not zebra to across the street, homeless!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Class-invictus
30,Culturally significant for entertainment industry but not attractive,"Sunset Boulevard itself is very long - 22 miles. It covers a lot of ground in LA, is full of traffic and busy (4 lanes). We drove past some nice shopping places and cafes in parts of the road further west but as you get to the Sunset Strip part, it just looks like one strip mall after another - an unattractive mess to my eyes. There is a lot of music/pop culture history here. You can see the Whiskey A Go Go where Goldy Hawn was a Go Go Dancer and the Doors were a house band in the 1960s and just up the road is the infamous (for River Phoenix) Viper Room. You'll also drive past the (also slightly infamous) Chateau Marmot along here. Not attractive but lots to see and very popular bar scene at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgo96
40,"Tourist, tourist, tourist!",Yes it is a mindless tourist thing. I like just driving from my aunt's house in Pacific Palisades up to Hollywood and the 101 freeway. Tons of stuff to look at and do once one gets past the 405 freeway. Plan half a day or maybe a whole day the drive the length of it just to say you have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jroberto
40,Its the Sunset Strip....,"..so you've got to walk it! It's more living in the past if anything, but for me I had to visit to see 80's Rock Venue legends such as The Roxy, Whiskey-a-go-go (where Goldie Hawn was discovered) and the more up to date notorious Viper Room, as well as the world famous Comedy Store (where many US legends have played such as Jim Carey, John Belushi, Bill Hicks and Eddie Murphy)This IS L.A Baby!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgevader

50,Better than Hollywood BLVD,"I was a bit worried about coming here as it looked a bit run down from the end we walked in on and having a bad experience down Hollywood BLVD.It was dusk and starting to get busy with people going to bars and restaurants. A lot of interesting people and things to see!I loved it, we went to a few bars including the famous Rainbow bar (being a G n R fan) and also saw the Viper Rooms, Whiskey a Go Go etc.We met up with friends from the UK and had a fantastic evening, one of the best nights of our holiday!! If I ever return to LA I will defffff stay on Sunset. There is a lot more to be seen!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EROSE89
20,Past it,We walked down Sunset Boulevard and it has long since lost its glitz and glamour. Stick to Hollywood Boulevard which runs parallel to this.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russ1470
30,Bit of a dump,Absolute dump. Was not what I was expecting at all after seeing it in Hollywood movies. Drive down just to say you've done it but there are nicer places to visit in and around LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/338sharone
30,Classic,"There are tons of sites to see down this street! It certainly is not the prettiest street in the world. I thought it was helpful to take a tour bus that drove on Sunset Blvd (in addition to other stops), instead of driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jno993
50,Take a walk down Sunset!,"We started out walk at The Rainbow Bar and Grill and walked Sunset until Guitar Centre, went north towards Hollywood and Highland and then back down to Amoeba Music. Deffinitly takes a couple hours to do once you stop in and see certain stores and restaurants. There are so many famous places with so much history to see when walking Sunset. I recommend starting early in the morning if you want to walk Sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandah62

40,Drivin' & Smilin',"You can't help but smile when driving down such a famous street! Do not expect a Disney experience, but you can see some famous sites and some nice houses. I would combine the drive with visiting Hollywood and Beverly Hills, and it is not far from Universal Studios.TIP: Try to hit this area outside of rush hour and weekends as it will be much easier to get around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTravelerRadio
40,you can see some famous spots on this street.,"one of Hollywoods most famous and also the world famous street in Hollywood,Calif.the shops and places to eat and drink are just endless. this is part of the old Hollywood when in the old days the start would drive down the street to get attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barryn680
30,Drive along,"It is a long boulevard. It took us from our residence towards all the things we went to see. Great houses though! And if you are lucky, you might get a glimpse of a celeb. Our kids sure saw Mickey Mouse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxHubner
50,Dream of a Lifetime,"We were on a 16th birthday trip for a person that has never been to LA. Seeing the places she has always dreamed of going to thru her eyes was magical. We drove up Sunset instead of of down and she was just taking everything I like a kid in a candy store. I think driving down is better, but she didn't.t know the difference",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureenk885

40,Cleaned up it's act,"Years ago I came here and it was grungy and nasty, a place I wouldn't want to walk around at night. Now all things have changed. There's still the usually assortment of crazy people and oddballs (it is Hollyweird after all) but now the scariness has been replaced by fun and excitement, with excellent parking, great restaurants and brewhouses, and the ever present and remarkable Hollywood Palladium. Definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brother_Kurt

50,Quirky Shopping,"We first went on a tour of LA and my wife loved Sunset Blvd. so after the tour we drove over there and walked around, and walked and walked and my wife shopped and shopped, omg. I usually hate shopping but here, shopping was different. Each store is unique and has a different quirkiness to it. There are shops of all kind. As we were walking, a huge crowd quickly formed and apparently a celebrity was walking down the street shopping too. I wanted to go check it out but I felt I should leave the person alone as they are human beings and perhaps don’t want to be swarmed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela

20,Shops. BORING!!!!,"Not my thing- too many shops, rich people... I prefer being in nature so this is not my thing. Just lots of expensive shops with expensive things all kept by snooty shopkeepers.

40,Many iconic landmarks,"Cruising the Sunset Boulevard is unavoidable to anyone visiting Hollywood and Beverly Hills. The strip is filled with iconic places such as bars, comedy clubs and cafes. Note that actually driving the strip isn't that thrilling: with many stop lights and obscured views, the best angle is hovering above your car, and is available only in the movies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GameServer
20,Nice when to sun is up,"Nice to walk around during the day. Not so nice a night. Good for food as there are restaurants galore. Looking for shoes? Off Broadway shoes has to be one of the largest show stores. But at night, I did not feel too safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JPL0626

40,After you endure LAX and the 405...,"Long as you're there, do the Strip... Better yet, rent a Ferarri and drive it like Ari and I forget who was in the Porsche did in that one episode of Entourage (back when it was good)... It's worth the ticket and gets better the closer you get to the ocean... And do some shopping, what the heck... Also (I lived in Marina Del Rey), I'll put in a plug for Tito's Tacos, barely off Washington on the 405. It's a bit of a local icon, maybe not in a culinary way, but for the fun of being there. Character...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tvland224
40,Nice to cruise the strip.,"If you have a car to drive make sure you cruise Sunset Blvd. It's a main street that goes for miles. We drove it from Hollywood to Beverly Hills. The street is lined with everything from restaurants, bars, boutiques, grocery stores and fast food restaurants. The famous live music bars Whisky a-go-go, Viper room, Roxy and others are located here. There is a lot of traffic but everything moves well and the traffic lights give you a chance to look around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sightseesylviaP
40,You need to visit here if you are in LA,This was a really fun and vibrant place to visit. There was a substantial amount if entertainment and several good restaurants to eat at while you are there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LanceS582
40,Times Changes but the Strip remains,"Really interesting when you walking along the hollowed sidewalks of one of the most famous streets in America. Historically it resembles little of Hollywood’s past with all the construction going on and traffic which can be a challenge, still if you like to walk it has so many interesting stores, boutiques, eateries both famous and not so much. Be sure to check the side streets as well since you’re going to find a few hidden gems to explore, remember the Strip as it’s called was once home to Hollywood elite and famous clubs and restaurants but like time everything changes, still it has its appeal & mystique so enjoy it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallyreidjr

40,Better than Hollywood Blvd,"You hear many things on TV and the internet about the reputation of certain places. I'd always heard about ""seedy"" Sunset Boulevard. We found this to be the opposite. Compared to the parallel Hollywood Blvd, Sunset was way nicer, cleaner and had some great shots, restaurants and a cinema with more to offer than TCL Chinese Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/filmdavid
40,Had to experience it but too crowded and seedy,"We enjoyed seeing all the stars, but would have enjoyed it more if pushy hawkers weren't constantly trying to sell us their CDs etc on the street the whole time. As a tourist, did not really feel safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenNM

50,Awesome place to party,"You can have a long evening walk here and every 200m you should approach nice place to grab a drink, dine or dance.In general if you don't have any plans for the evening this should be your destination. Good mixed crowd and lot of people looking for fun make that place special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatGrumbler

50,Must do in LA,"We stayed on Sunset Blvd whilst we were in LA and I'm so glad that we did. So many great places to eat and have a drink. It had a really great vibe about it and we felt safe walking along there even at night. Yes there are homeless people along here, but nowhere near as many as there are at Venice beach. We loved it's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joshane615

50,Memories of Hollywood's Glamour Years,"You cannot come to Los Angeles and not visit at least some part of Sunset Strip. Because I am slightly mad and obsessed with the glory years, I have actually walked the whole length, as I have La Brea Avenue.I would say the most interesting parts of ""The Boulevard"" are towards Sunset Strip where you will find Johnny Depp's Viper Rooms, where a young River Phoenix spent his last hours, and on the opposite side of the road The Whisky-a-Go-Go, where Debbie Harry's Blondie exploded on to the punk scene. At the other end, if you walk down Vine Street you will find Amoeba Records, Sunset & Gower studios, and on the corner of Sunset & Vine, the best Wallgreens in LA. Again, I'll let my photo's do the talking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/310GeorgeH
30,CALIFORNIA DRIVING NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART,Not overly impressed. Kind of dirty. Lots of stores and shopping sites. Traffic in California is outrageous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanaFradette
30,All of LA in the one street,"Starting almost in Malibu at Inceville and heading East you pass through the hills to Brentwood, Westwood, Beverly Hills, and then Hollywood before you pop out just North of Downtown near Chinatown. The West end is where you drive through where Steven Spielberg, Rhianna, the Hef, Adam Sandler, and Tom Cruise live, and is some of the nicer real estate in LA. Usually all you can see is a high wall covered in ivy, but hey, it is Steven's ivy. Right?The Hollywood area on the strip is bars and adult tourist fun with regular strip mall stores, pizza joints, and the odd Thai massage place. You can see where River Phoenix OD'd, the bar Johnny Depp used to own, the pub where Halle Berry crashed her car and ran away, or even pop into the Hustler store for a few fun items for Gran and Pop. Honestly, it was fairly interesting in that part in daytime, so at night it must be really exciting.Then it continues as it curves South East through Echo park to Downtown. The middle of Sunset is where you could really find a lot of entertainment/fun/felony offenses/incurable diseases, and is probably what most people think of. The South East end is where you can get a $1 car wash and have a conflict free Kombucha burrito cleanse while you get your next tattoo.It was an interesting drive. There was nothing specific that it offered to me personally, but to see the change in the urban environments as you move from where the super rich live, through the armpit, and then to the more working class part of town was interesting. It is like someone has just taken a slice out of LA, and in the one drive you get to sample almost all it has to offer without actually going into the areas where you risk not coming out alive. Like South Central.Do it. Take the kids. With the doors locked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle
30,Walking it not particularly recommended.,"The sidewalks are in terrible condition, only marginally worse than the roads. Still I fould a great coffee shop, Javista at 6707 Sunset, and an interesting Church (see photos).Overall it was an interesting experience, probably one I wouldn't do at night!As far as driving it goes...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
20,not sure what the fuss is about,I walked from Hollywood to Sunset strip. Waste of time. Parts are seedy and I wasn't sure I actually arrived at the Sunset strip for a while. It was off season and is definitely for those 20 something's for nightlife. Highlight were the two gorgeous barmaids at the pub I went into.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pommieexpat
50,very touristy.....,"it's Los Angeles and in the heart of downtown so i expected it to be very crowded. just to chill-out and walk around the boulevard. a lot of interesting character, very hollywood, of course, if you like shopping and food this is the place for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wakisobol

40,a very pleasant and long drive from the Pacific coast to Hollywood.,"Because of the speed limit and the traffic, it takes about 45 minutes to drive along the entire boulevard.

30,Scummy rock and roll crazyland (i happen to like that) worth a drive down it,"Its kind of divey and well, not very classy. I was approached by a crazy girl on rollerblades wearing a tutu and not much else. I was at the gas station leaning on the car talking with a friend (I know, it already sounds like i was asking for it) when she skated up. Now, I love a crazy person so I was interested in her appearance and made a head nod so my friend could check her style. So, she must have noticed or really, I am usually a freak magnet anyway...so she skates up and super low she says ""Oh you wanna fight? You want to fight about it?"" and some other mumbled threats. I completely disregarded her and continued talking to my friend and she skated off. she made one more attempt to rile me but it didn't work.That said, there were lots of rocker types and gutter punks. The hotel next to the comedy club (Upright citizens Brigade- go there) the Hollywood Stars Inn has the best reviews (comedy wise- not classy) and you should look them up.If you like to see the seedy underbelly of places and not just tourist crap, then take a drive down. maybe stop somewhere for a drink and grab a 5-10 dollar comedy show at the UCB mentioned earlier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol
50,Beautiful drive lots to see,"We really enjoyed our drive down Sunset Blvd. So much to see. We took a number of good photos together and went exploring the shops. The weather was very agreeable.

40,hmm undecided,Thee is a lot of history in sunset. It is a must see. I suggest a tour guide for if you are a tourist. However use uber and ask questions its just as good as a tour. Sunset has a lot of great places to eat and see people! Cool places to see but Thursday are dead!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992nicolec
50,Easy Drive - So Much to See,"Sunset Boulevard is a cultural experience to drive and get the 'feel' of California.

50,Get Your Fix,"This street has everything! There are so many restaurants, shops, and clubs. If you are like me and a rock music freak, the Sunset Strip part of Sunset Blvd. is the place to visit. The world famous Whiskey a Go-Go, the Rainbow Bar and Grill, the Viper Room, the Roxy are all located within a quick walking distance. If you go up further on Sunset, you'll go into Beverly Hills. On the more southern end are places like Ameoba Music (which is AWESOME) and a lot of other places. Way too many to name. It's definitely one of my most favorite areas on the planet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeidiD245
30,Sunset Strip,Sunset Boulevard stretches to over 22 miles but most people only deal with the section of West Hollywood well known for clubs and at one time street prostitution when the area was cleaned up in the 1990s.We took a short stroll at a section and and a drive through although its more crazier in the evening.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrestonGuild
40,It's A Cool Street,"Sunset is a very long street. It goes from Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles to the Pacific Coast Highway at the Pacific Ocean in Pacific Palisades so it runs about 35 km (~22miles). On a long street like this what should you do? The Sunset Strip portion of Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood is famous for its active nightlife so go there to party. Part of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is also sometimes called Guitar Row due to the large number of guitar stores and music industry-related businesses so check out some guitars. Visit Chateau Marmont, Comedy Store or Viper Room and definitely have breakfast at The Griddle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SedaEg
30,"It´s a street, but a cool one","Sunset Boulevard is a street. Period.On the other hand it´s quite a nice street, at least parts of it. Since it stretches some 39km (about 24 miles) from the coast in the west towards east at the L.A. basin there are some stretches that are worth visiting. But it is most of the time crowded with traffic way beyond its capacity.Be sure to the out the Rock Walk of Fame at Guitar Center, The Sunset Junction Street Fair and the famous Chateau Marmont Hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hans_Osvalds
40,Fun to stroll around,"Interesting boulevard, lots to see. Traffic gets buys, so take that into account. Kids really wanted to see where Nickelodeon Studios were, so had to stop there for pictures. But more sightseeing than anything else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DannyR956
30,Interesting street,"Long strip with lots to see. A mixture of restaurants, schools, residential areas and places of worship. Runs parallel to Hollywood Blvd, very long strip.

40,Sunset Boullevard,"Hell of a road trip, it goes on for miles! There is something about the name that makes you want to drive the length of it.

30,Average,I didn't find this area too interesting. It was good to experience it and I am glad I did but it was a street with some cool looking cafes and restaurants and expensive looking shops. Not something I would go out of my way to do again. There are much better things to do while in Hollywood I felt it was a bit of a waste of time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKB0022
30,Depends what your into,"It certainly is an interesting drive as some have said. There's some cool restaurants, cafes and bars along there and any type of shop you need.

40,Just got to go there,"How can you visit LA as a tourist and not visit Sunset Boulevard? The drive along it was great. Seeing so many sights that I'd only heard of. My advice would be to go along it as part of a tour rather than drive it yourself. Perhaps take a tour out to Santa Monica? That way you get to see more rather than concentrating on the traffic around you, which can be insane!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TOM-C--LIVERPOOL

40,A beautiful way into the heart of LA,"People warned me about LA traffic and how it would be a nightmare to get in and out of the city by car. Well, they didn't take into consideration Sunset Boulevard.All the way in from Santa Monica to the heart of Hollywood took only 30 min ands it was 39 min of a visual spectacular from palm tree lined roads to mansions and gated estates.It really is a wonderful way to visit LA and the traffic really isn't that bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmAitchKay

20,Busy and rather seedy,"Have to say that i did not like Sunset Boulevard and I really can't see what all the fuss is about. It's just a busy main road with quite a lot of tourist trap shops on the main section. I went to look at the ""Hands and Feet"" of the Hollywood greats. That was also disappointing. Just dents in concrete, very crowded and says nothing of the stars to whom they are meant to belong. I walked the boulevard for quite a few blocks in both directions from the central area. It gets gradually seedier in both directions.So, I'm sorry, but it's just a below-average shopping street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rexbarker

50,Very Busy Street,"There's a lot to see on this street but there is a lot of traffic. Since I'm a huge music fan, I was the most interested in seeing The Rainbow Room, The Whiskey and The Roxy.

50,Walking On Sunset Boulevard,"There are a lo of interesting shops and restaurants on Sunset Boulevard. The Los Angeles Film School was my most favorite of visiting because I had an interest in all their programs mostly there animation and film program. The walk of fame is nearby, I was able to film the Hollywood sign as opposed to going to it.It is better to walk on Sunset Boulevard as opposed to driving on it, there is no such thing as good driving in LA. lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justinlawliet77
50,"Beautiful street, lots of shops, restaurants and great people-watching!","So I spend several hours walking on Sunset Boulevard and it's so pretty!!There's a wonderful view from the city, you can see all the skyscrapers rising up below you, it's so cool!There's some interesting buildings (Director's Guild of America office for example, which is HUGE), found a truly wonderful restaurant called Luca on Sunset, and Book Soup is a pretty damn cool book store.I suggested over 3 hours for this, but it depends - I like wandering in and out of the shops, taking photos, so all that will take up time.There's designer shops, cafes, all kinds of people and it was just fun walking around the street looking at everything, it was one of my favourite places in L.A.!It was just a gorgeous sunny day and it was cool to see the view of the city, and see all the gated fancy houses behind Chateau Marmont!I'd definitely recommend checking it out and seeing it for yourself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieSparkles101
20,The drive is not worth the time,"We did the roughly 40 minute drive west from Hollywood towards Malibu. The windy road takes you through the touristy areas into more secluded residential areas. No major attractions on the drive, not even any large mansions. It is even more difficult for the driver to enjoy the sights as the road is quite windy in sections. The best view is when you reach the Pacific Coast Highway and see the ocean, which you can see just driving along the PCH. Wish we had just taken the highway and avoided the traffic to get to the coast along with saving some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pinter17

20,CROWDS whenever you go,Interesting time. Did not intentionally go but wound up there anyway.A lot of people walking around aimlessly taking pictures with random people dressed up like characters then demanding money. Yeah um NAH!!!!!Definitely be mindful of who is around you as there are a lot of sleazy people hanging around. My son and I decided to jump on a bus and get the hec out of dodge. You can def skip this one. Way too crowded and just not worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesetteh

30,Nice Drive,We drove close to sunset sun was bright and in our eyes. Nice restaurants and good shopping. By chance can see celebrities. If you are impressed with expensive automobiles a good place to cruise around. Comedy clubs good. I must be honest these types of things do not impress me and so someone else might rate this far higher than I would. I would not walk across the street to see Brad Pitt. Traffic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom1941
40,Notable road with contrast,"Sunset Boulevard is a notable road with contrast, as there is expensive and luxury houses in the end of Beverly Hills and in the other end you have the area with strip clubs, bars and houses that definitely need to be repaired.It is a must see tourist stuff, and my best advice is AVOID THIS ROAD IN THE RUSH HOUR. Unless you like getting stuck in the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadsP_12
20,It's a road,We drove down the street because it is the tourist thing to do but to be honest I have seen nicer streets. This place has history but it has also seen better days. It is a thing to tick of the LA tourist list but overall not impressive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IOGWFH
50,Iconic Road in the heart of Hollywood,"I never thought it was possible to find a road enjoyable but Sunset Blvd is certainly one!Hotels, bars and restaurants provide the best of what is to offer in the evening on an iconic road.Cafe Med, Bar Rock and the Viper room are just a few of them many places you can visit along the way. Or just take a drive to get a true feel of Hollywood as the large billboards pass you by.It will not have great appeal to everyone but for me, this is one of my most favourite places to head to!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86MarkB86

30,glamorous it was not,"We drove along here in a fab open top car that my son had hired. We were looking for the glitz and glad glam, but it wasn't there.

I would not want Togo there in the dark that's for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sniknej187437

40,My run down Sunset Boulevard....,"For such an iconic place the reality of experiencing it is much different! But then I guess it depends on what time of day you go, what is going on, what was in the water that day!I love to run and have run up and down this boulevard maybe a dozen times. Every time different. It's full of independent businesses and the big brands, it's old and new. It's clean.. most of the time.Stopping at a different coffee shop/restaurant/café each time is the best bit. You never know what you are going to get. The mafia style Italian guy serving only double shots for $2. The coolest coffee cats that are strait out of a Burberry advert knocking up supermochaskimmedtrimmedlottalatte! The guy that shouted at me for looking at his bull dog because he had issues and had just come out of counseling... the dog that is!Go, take it in, and be glad you are you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thebackandforth
30,"A Food Street, but its not secure at night","Our hotel was located right in the heart of Sunset Boulevard. The location is very convenience to access for food purchase. Many restaurants and pizza shops located along Sunset Boulevard. You will never worry about ""food problem"" in late night. MOst of them are open until midnights or later. Also, one tip that i have to tell you, Mondays is not ""NO Food Day"". The location where my hotel at, the restaurants are closed on monday nights. However, there is another problem i have to mention here is the community safety problem. DO NOT LET YOU FEMALE FRIENDS GO OUT BY THEMSELVES AT NIGHT!!! THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS!!! One day, we went out for food pickup at nigh. We pull over the car by the sidewalk, i step out with another female friend to the restaurant for pick up. The distance between our car and the restaurant was about 10M away. There was a creepy homeless guy smiling and looking at us, made us feel uncomfortable. We ignored him and ran into the restaurant quickly. 5 mins after, that creepy guy didnt gone and still starring at restaurant door waiting for us to come out. We scared and can't just go out like this. Unfortunately, two of us left cellphones in the car, can't call on another two friends who stay in the car. and we need help to go out. We told the restaurant manager about it, that guy was nice, let us borrow his cellphone, and walk us back to the car safely!!! THank God!!! That was the most horrible experience in my trip. In the day, we don't see many homeless people or beggars walking around in the street; but at night times, there were alot, they kept asking you for a quarter of change. If any of female travelers are planning to visit Sunset Boulevard, just be aware of you own secure!! Stay Safe!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
40,The Sun never sets,"So Much of Los Angeles is a hodge podge. No wonder Sunset from Hillhurst / Virgil to the Beverly Hills line is surrealistic Hollywood is the most disappointing tourist destination extant.

40,Sunset Strip in West Hollywood - check out the billboards!,"I've been going to Equinox (fitness club) over on the Strip for several weeks, and there is always something to see here. Most entertaining are the huge billboards which change often. If you are driving, enjoy taking Sunset out to the ocean, and check out the beautiful Beverly Hills homes. ( Tip: the left lane is best as you near Westwood; the right is sketch with some pot holes and such.) Many, many gorgeous cars here, as well. There is a parking lot next to Equinox, at Alta Loma Road, on the south side of Sunset. It's just a block long; turn right if coming from the west. Just up on street level, if you take the elevator, is a great news stand. The Earth Bar has healthy snacks and smoothies.

Hollywood High still has its corner but most of the big intersections are now bracketed with ugly little malls (or, in the case of Vine St., ugly big malls). You could be in Kansas...or Minneapolis. No vision, no charm.

I'm not sure what I expected really, and although it was exciting seeing the famous sights, I was a bit disappointed, but I'm not really sure why!However, it was nice to drive past and see (albeit briefly) famous places such as Chateau Marmont (the entrance sign anyway!), the Viper Room, Comedy Store, House of Blues, Directors Guild of America etc. And, of course, the billboards (Jennifer Aniston being the major one, on this occasion).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DONNYLOVER

20,"Worth driving, but overrated","The pure fame of the street deserves a trip, but there really isn't anything spectacular to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheTravelAddiction
30,High expectations,"That's the problem, you go with high expectations from the movies you've seen and then it disappoints. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place but a normal place, nothing really fancy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/17miguelm
40,A true Hollywood experience,If you want to come here because of what you've seen on T.V and movies I encourage you to do so! You'll be surprised on what it's really like. I'll leave it at that,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/284BrianT
50,boulevard of LA,new york have time square so LA have this place... dont missed it... you can see hows great of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amazinggirls
50,It is what it is..,A great place to come to to check out ...fun and different,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/questionsc
20,Strip,"All bad, just junk, don't go. Touristy t-shirs shops, pesky photo-op shills, bad traffic, OK restaurants. Don't go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ANonyMouse45
30,Nice but I expected more,"Sunset Boulevard is well known all over the world. Most because of the movies offcourse and Beverly Hills being linked to it. So, my expectations were high. To high maybe. There was not really much to see. I must say it was very clean though. Palmtrees and so and. Very nice. There was also much space for the pedestrians. But like I said before: I expected more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RubenV730
40,A hit or miss place,"You can see some great music here, find different restaurants, or get ripped off. At night you can see some really different types of fauna.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finnagain57
30,I saw no celebrities,"Lots of expensive restaurants, bars and shops...if that's what you like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carry_0n_traveler
50,pretty,"sunset blvd is a five min walk from the days inn hotel,its really pretty and there is a great shopping centre on that strip , must visit. great shops",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deniz91
40,Unique from end-to-end!,"Sunset Boulevard extends from cosmopolitin shopping areas, past a polo ground, past EXCELLENT restaruants, and deserves frequent visits, as some of the scenery and views will change from season-to-season, and/or from year-to-year!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amercorp
40,Touristy spot,"There are a ton of places to eat, shop and people watch. Just remember, if you want to be there so do hundreds of other people. Expect a lot of tourists! If you go there to eat dinner you'll need reservations. The best advise I can give is to plan ahead, be flexible and keep your camera ready in case you see someone famous!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nateinusaf
20,Not a great place to walk around,"Not a great place to just walk around. You won't see cool stuff. Sunset blvd has great restaurants, hotels, and bars but you have to know where you are going and I suggest driving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kayc464
40,Nighttime fun,"Bring patience for driving the strip, but take a walk around. Historic rock clubs everywhere! If clubbing is your thing, you can find that too. Be prepared for some velvet-rope action. During the day there is a completely different vibe. As a local, I like it down that way for lunch or coffee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoannaB618
50,Drive to Malibu,Take Sunset through all the nice neighborhoods all the way to Malibu. There's plenty to see and shops and restaurants along the way. Malibu is worth the drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JMRow
30,"Ya see one, ya seen it all","Sunset, Rodeo Drive, Wilshire Blvd., etc., etc. Nothing special about these drives. (yawning)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenH92807
30,Ok kinds,"Well, I had heard a lot about Sunset Boulevard but it didnt live upto the expectations. I found it to be just like any other pier in any other city. I could have missed going here on my trip and not regretted the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kanika_Sharma_Gera
40,Worth seeing,"I rode on Sunset Boulevard from Hollywood Boulevard to Beverly Hills. I was on a tour bus, and didn't get off, but enjoyed seeing many places I have heard of along the way - Whiskey A-Go-Go, the Comedy Club, the Laugh factory, Chateau Marmont,etc. One of my favorite shows when I was growing up was ""77 Sunset Strip"" and so seeing the building that was used for the show was also kind of cool. There were a lot of really nice restaurants along the way, and if I had had more time, they would have been worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caram30
50,Take Sunset All the Way to Malibu,"Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is an attraction by itself, but there are many other entertainment trivia attractions along the way. The best of Sunset for me is the drive west through Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Bellaire. Try taking a right turn on one of those tree-lined streets going north from Sunset and see where many of the stars live and have lived for decades. Then get back to Sunset and continue westerly all the way to the Pacific Ocean and Malibu. The ride through Malibu Canyon along the way is beautiful. Once at the Ocean, turn left and drive down to Santa Monica Pier. Ideally do this journey in a convertible top auto or a motorcycle. This is California dreamin'",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieLTravels
30,Drive it and see the sights,"The best way to see Sunset strip is by driving and/or a tour guide. I'd recommend Dearly Departed, they know there stuff unlike alot of tour guides, who claim bogus things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tho0505
30,"OK, so its on the list 'cos you travelled to see it BUT ....","Your not going to travel to LA and not go and see this, but be advised its pretty disappointing unless your the sort of person who gets excited at train spotting or similar.Park at the Hollywood and HIghland centre which is right smack bang in the middle and cheap secure parking, its also a small shopping centre with restrooms etc.Basically Sunset Boulevard is a tatty area about 1000 metres to the East and only worth a walk for about 20 minutes, you'll see what I mean f you go much further, unless y ou want a tattoo or something that is.Very, very commercialised and pretty run down on the streets to the south, worth an hour or so but thats about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lazyoaf
40,Goes from downtown to the ocean - great way to see LA's diversity,"We recently had my fiance's brother & his wife in from Minneapolis. They'd never been to California before. We took them first to a Los Angeles Conservancy downtown tour (meets in Pershing Square). And then the Sunset Boulevard drive through the city.We took Sunset all the way from downtown to the ocean in Malibu / Santa Monica. It sort of goes from the poor side of LA to the rich (generally speaking). You see the seediness of downtown/Hollywood, the hipness too, you pass the famous Sunset Strip with the big billboards, the mansions in Beverly Hills, all the way down to the Pacific Ocean.Then we took them to the Reel Inn on the PCH (or rather, they treated us), which is a local fish place I'd always wanted to try (sometimes guests get you to do the things you've always wanted to do!). It was yummy, and it doesn't break the bank, unlike Gladstone's etc. We also walked across the street to the beach.They were thrilled with the whole LA day, and it was so easy for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Queen1000
