50,Must see show,"Ive been to many of the cirque shows but this one is the best of all. I dont want to spoil it for anyone but i want to let you know that the music is incredible the show is amazing and the venue is great too. Its located next to the Battle ship iowa, parking is super cheap too! I expected to pay at least 15 dollars but was surprised to find it was 4.00. Every seat in the house is a great seat so dont worry about where you sit!",Mildred B
