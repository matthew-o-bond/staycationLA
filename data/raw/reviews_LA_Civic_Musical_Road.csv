50,Musical oddity,"Have you ever heard your tires play a tune for you as you drive down the street. The street is strategically grooved to make your tires vibrate ""The William Tell Overture"" if you drive the exact speed limit. Go try it it's free and it's on the way to a fantastic park where you can fish, walk your dog, or let the kids run and play. ENJOY!!!",Mark W
50,"Truly a hoot, not far off of highway 14!","Truly a hoot, not far off of highway 14! Makes a nice rest break while traveling to or from Mammoth. We were on our way to see the poppies. Great roadside attraction.",Cavydad
50,How Fun!,Great way to surprise passengers in the car. A little out of the way but really fun. Make sure you are going at at least 60 mph. Easy to turn around to do it again,GPKbucket
50,Fun!,"My girlfriend just moved to Lancaster a few months ago, and we visit musical road almost every chance we get. It's never crowded. You can drive over it at different speeds to hear the recognizable tune.",compcrzy
40,Great unexpected treat,"Drive, listen and enjoy this musical treat embedded in the desert road. Enjoy!Highly recommend for those looking for something deferent and unusual. Try it at different speeds to change the pitch and tempo.",Commercialtourist
50,Simple Fun,This is a cute out to the way fun. It is so interesting the first time I was taken there I was blindfolded so I could not see what was coming up. I think this added to the fun because since you don’t know what you are there for when you first hear the music it is so fun (and surprising). I have taken several others and had them blindfolded as well and it never fails to surprise and bring smiles and laughter. They have place you can make a U-turn so you can do it several time. Three (3) to four (4) times usually works for me but there is no limit on how many times you can do it. We drive at different speeds too (not to fast) just to hear the difference. It is just fun and different. If you are into the quirky this is just a cute fun thing to do (if you are passing through).,Cute_Lissette
50,ROCK ON,"I'm sure this is what William Tell's overture was originally created for, 🤣😂. The kids, self included, love heading down the road to re-create the overture with our tires. I find the best speed is 57 mph but don't tell anyone I advised this speed as its a bit faster than the roads limit 🤤. We always make a u-turn and go back over the road a minimum of three times to hear the road at different speeds. Im compelled to state: Please drive responsibly!",DeShara B
40,Cute little oddity...,It is fun to drive over to hear the tune out in the middle of nowhere... we drive it every time we have family out,jenjetmd
50,Music to our ears,Very unique experience to have here in our town! Be sure to go the right speed to hear it correctly! Kids will love it too!!,L. E. Cox
40,A little something extra,"When visiting an area of town sometimes you want to see or eat ar visit something different. This road visit is that something different that you'll enjoy and can say ""WOW""",bigcece
50,wierd!,The road was actually musical.... unreal. Not the normal surface noise but musical!!! not very long but will have to come back and do it again :).,RorysRavers
50,Hidden Marvel!,We went here after our trip to the California Poppy Reserve. It was about 16 miles drive. There was no other car and looks like a regular highway until you see the sign Musical Road. Once you drive you hear the humming sound. It's pretty cool. It was very short I have to drive back and repeat the whole process to soak in the sounds from the road.,Anthony I
50,Music,This is a truly unique road like no other. You must experience it at least once. Children are amazed as to where the music is originating from.,Joan H
50,Cool concept,"It's a short drive, so it's not what I would call a must see, but it's such a cool concept that you should definitely check it out if you're in Lancaster. You pretty much drive on a road with grooves and it generates music. What a wonderful idea! It's a lot cooler experiencing this than explaining. I'm surprised someone spent money on developing this, but it's cool nonetheless.",Josh L
50,"Its Always a Must for Me: Civic Musical Road, Lancaster",I was in Lancaster (again) and of course I had to drive the Musical Road Its fun to drie and I love the sounds.,mini
50,"Well, that was fun!","There are only a few ""Musical Roads"" in the world. This one is out of tune, but you can tell it is William Tell Overture. There is no signage on Hwy 14, so you kinda have to know this is on Ave. G, westbound, left lane between 30th and 40th Avenues. It's fun. I did a U turn and drove it 3 times.",librarianlorraine
50,"Super fun, short activity","This was an easy side activity to do on the way back to the hotel from the Poppy Reserve. It only lasts about 10 seconds, but both my husband and 8yr old loved it. Are use GPS to get there, I just typed in Civic musical Road, and my GPS was able to pull it up. You start to see signs when you get closer telling you where to go. It’s pretty easy to follow, and a lot of fun",JoyNCH
40,Fun to hear,"Even an amateur can play this William Tell Overture. Just a minute from the 14 Hwy, it’s worth a short detour. It’s an amusing addition to travels.",Kirk H
50,Quirky and Fun,"While visiting Lancaster I enjoy trying to find fun things to do. This is free, quick, and fun as well. I am surprised at how many who live in the area know nothing about this short musical road. It's worth the drive just for the laugh of the flat version of the ending of the William Tell Overture (aka, Lone Ranger tune). It is literally just a few seconds (maybe 10?) long, but such a fun, quirky thing to check out.",LeslieinTN
50,Family Fun,We love going over the musical road! You can never seem to do it just once. We go over it at lease twice.,have1onu
50,Clever use of road bumps,"En route to Apollo Park we drove over a segment of musical road on Avenue G going west. Just follow The signs. The kids had such a good time that we made a u-turn and repeated it one more time. We could have done it again, too. With windows closed and at the permitted speed the tune sounded more like Jingle Bells Rock than the William Tell Overture. But who cared?",bfindysz
40,One of a kind experience,"What time we have family visiting, we always take them to the music world. This is a one-of-a-kind experience that your visitors will truly enjoy. Everyone tries to figure out the science behind the music road. It’s an amazing experience in the California desert. Truly, take your family to enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience.",jillybee23
40,Name That Tune!,"The Civic Musical Road is a very clever idea. It is a patch of road that is designed in such a way that as you drive over the road, the friction between the tires and the road produces a musical tune. To get the best effect you have to drive at a certain speed. Great activity to do on the way out to Apollo Park. Its not an activity that takes a lot of time( unless you decide to turn around and drive back over the road a few times :-). I like to check it out on the way to the Apollo park in the late afternoon. Then take a walk around the park, check out the ducks, let the kids play on the playground equipment, and enjoy the afternoon desert breeze. The park closes at sunset. Afterwards, we head back to Lancaster and enjoy an evening meal. The last time we went was in early 2018. But we have been more than once and with a variety of types of people. Everyone gets a kick out of the experience.",NesbugTraveler
40,Worth a 60 second detour!,"The musical road is less than a minute off the freeway in the outskirts of town. It’s a fun 5 minute diversion. Take a couple trips down the little stretch of road at different speeds. Convenient, free, and puts a smile on your face.",Joseph L
50,Amazing ride,This was such a HOOT to drive. We took the road over and over again at different speeds to hear the tune in slo-mo and fast like a 78 record- so much fun and amazing that some one found a way to make music with the road and the tires of your car!,925darleent
20,Huh?,"I was really excited when I pulled off the highway to try this out late at night. When we first drove through the piece of road at 50mph, me and the wife definitely heard a musical tune, but weren’t sure what It was. So we did an illegal uturn (hey, we’re crazy retirees!) and tried again. It sounded like Jingle Bells and then the Death Star theme from Star Wars. Then we read It was the William Tell overture, which is the Lone Ranger theme. So then we drove at 70. Nope. Still doesn’t sound like the Lone Ranger. I read It was busted. Uh, why hasn’t it been fixed? Get it together, Lancaster! What else you got going on?",Scott L
50,Makes you smile,Drive down a short stretch of road and listen while your tires sing you a song! It is very short but worth the trip down the left hand side of the road.,Kathy H
50,Visit,This is kinda fun thing to do with the grandsons. They love it and we love watching them enjoy it. To get the full effect turn off your radio and go 55. Have fun!,Helen H
40,Fun but short,"It was fun to drive through the musical road and hear the music notes playing. But before you realized it, it was over, so we had to turn around and drive through it again. Kids loved it. Wish it can be a longer road.",Linda W
40,Open your windows!,Fun to hear the music created as you drive and opening the window is even more fun. Had to go over it a few times at different speeds. What fun!!,Ron J
40,Musical Road,My sister drove me down this road and I was able to hear the music for the first time. You must drive in a specific lane and it's best to ride in silence to hear it. I enjoyed the experience.,genieller
40,Road test of a vehicle,Took a new vehicle on a road test to see how would perform and just happen to drive on Lancaster famous musical road. The musical performance of the road was very good and I believe most people who drive on this road would find it interesting.,nongmeejohn
30,Cool but...,"The musical road is fun for the firs time. However, due to tolerance stack ups from how it was measured, the sound will always be off. Listen to the Lone Ranger theme song before you drive over it to hear the difference.",Ryan
50,musical road,its great to take the kids to enjoy. its also near a big fishing park called Apollo park. not too long of a road thogh,graciepeaktownhouse
50,Pretty Cool!,"I remember when this section of road, sponsored by Honda, first opened. It wasn't too far from homes & the neighbors complained of the constant noise. The city destroyed the grooves in 2 wks & re-located it to a less populous area leading to Fox Field (an airport). You must be traveling 50 MPH with the windows up. It's a real trip to take unsuspecting peeps there! I visit often.Continue to the airport for lunch at Foxy's, where firefighting air tankers load up.Take Ave.G west off Hwy 14, 3 miles",1stSpike
50,Fun and no stopping needed,"If you’re going to head West on 138 or just want a small break, the musical road is an amusing diversion. The William Tell Overture (I think that’s it) never sounded so good when played by tires!",kirkh84
40,Short but Sweet,I drive this road every time I'm in the area. It never gets old. Best at a pretty good speed. You need to be in the left lane traveling west on Avenue G to get the music.,Clare D
50,Amazing Road,You just follow the trees on West Avenue G and you will come to a sign that says its the Musical Road. Drive over it and you will hear the music. Be sure you close the windows in your car for better sounds. The road looks like a keyboard. Very Amazing.,Jim K
50,Thanks Honda,Honda's music road is always a cute destination for out-of-towners. I drive for Uber and Lyft. They all love it. Thanks Honda!,Ranch I
40,Engineering Marvel,"Designed and constructed by Honda for a commercial this small stretch of road between the 14 Fwy and Apollo Park plays the finale of the William Tell Overture when driven over at around 55 mph. It’s a fun novelty to experience especially if you are headed to north west end of the valley to look at poppies, ride bikes around Apollo Park, or even on the way to the Exotic Feline Breeding Compound.",ngordon515
50,Unique Experience - Quite Fun!,"I was alone and I thoroughly enjoyed this! The first time I got so excited, I drove too fast and messed up the song. LOL. Go their recommended speed and you will hear the song, properly. I video taped it and drove on the musical road about 3 times. Pure joy - like when you were a kid! I really enjoyed it.",Danielle R
50,Quick and worth trying,"We had fun on a Monday morning at the Musical Road. It's the left lane down a bit away from the highway on Ave G. It is well marked once you get there. We (two adults, no kids) did it twice and laughed both times.",jdemarre
40,Just a Drive Bye,Kids love it and it's easy to enjoy. If you ever find yourself in the desert drive by the musical road it's crazy how it happens but with all the windows app you hear the song that they engraved into the street do the vibrations of your car kids absolutely lose their mind and love it.,Bware B
40,Interesting - kids love it.,"Passing through to Apollo Park or the air show.. merge left and check it out. Honest, I probably wouldn’t go if it were just a dollar. 🤷🏻‍♀️",Michelle S
50,A drive on the Musical Road.,"If you have friends or relatives coming to the Antelope Valley load them up in the car and take a drive to the musical road. Located on West Ave G. Their is a sig to tell you when it starts. It is in the North lane heading west towards 40th st west. It is not very long, but your guest will get a kick out of how riding over the road it makes music. The song is William Tell Overture. It is not in tune, but you can still make it out when you drive 60moh over the area. Guarantee they will ask to go over it more than once. When your done keep driving to 50th street make a right and go to Apollo Park. Nice Walking path, lots of ducks to feed so take some bread.",chucklinn55
50,111 must see places in LA (Book),"This summer my daughter and I are on a treasure hunt to experience and learn new things (she is in the 3rd grade). We live in the area and never knew this little gem existed. It is fun. Not a long street maybe a 1/8 of a mile but the grooves in the road play a song. If you enjoy small unique things that leave an big impression then this is one of them. If you drive up here though make sure you add the big cat refuge, the air force base, historical airplane museum, and other attractions to make it worth the trip!",StThomas C

30,Meh...,"This sounded like fun but first of all, it's quite far outside of town and second, it only lasts a few seconds. Also, although I did recognize the melody, it was a bit off.Definitely not a top attraction.",Raven25Blue
50,Fun experience,"We took a little detour to drive the musical road and it was well worth it. The first time we were going too slow and were flat, second time around seemed better. I could get all nerdy and prattle on about the opportunities for a brief physics lesson, but I won’t and will just say it is a fun experience. Plus it’s free!!",Charlotte J

40,Just for fun,"We had visitors in town who actually asked about this road. Anyone who lives out here is like, ""it's alright,"" but apparently it's dinner than we give itt credit for. So, we took our friends down the musical road and they lived it! The reaction was so awesome that we needed up enjoying it too. A fun and definitely different experience.",Melissa B
30,not to bad if you have a fairly quiet vehicle.,Its from the old HONDA commercial back in the early 80's I think. It is the 1st street North of the Antelope fairgrounds. You will need to be in the INSIDE or number 1 lane when you get to it. It is about 1/4 mile long and the way the pavement is cut it more or less have a sorta musical sound to it.If you are in a vehicle which is not a quiet running one you will just barely be able to hear the noise from your wheels running over it. Its ok for a one time thing just to check it out but nothing really special about it.,retiredoldsarge
40,Never gets old,Little musical road is cool. Short but never gets old. Kids like it lol. Has about 10 seconds of music/sound lol,G0908
40,Unique Experience,"We think the road might need to be ""tuned"" as it didn't sound quite right...but for a free attraction unlike anything else anywhere, it's well worth a drive if you're already in the Antelope Valley. Make sure you roll down your windows...drive westbound in the left-most lane and suddenly you're an expert ""Road"" player. (You should start a band.)We were there on a Sunday early afternoon and there was no traffic whatsoever...no long lines of cars waiting to drive on the musical road, so odds are whenever you go this is a very easy accessible attraction for you.",rickpoet
20,Ridiculous idea it was moved,The musical road sounded flat and awful since the previous location sounded greater. The residents shows how many people are too sensitive to deal with tourism in the world today. I'm blaming Jerry brown for this!,weirdovisitingplaces

30,A road with a melody,"This road is quite unique. From what I understand, it was located elsewhere, but the music was disturbing neighbors. The new location is somewhat isolated, so a long drive from out of Antelope Valley is probably not warranted, unless you just gotta hear it. You actually do get the melody for us older listeners. The idea of a musical road is intriguing for the younger set.",Diane M

40,Unique Travel Treat,"A little startling the first time because I wasn't expecting it. I had a CD playing and thot the unfamiliar sound was something wrong with my car. After I recognized I was hearing a melody, I turned my music off, turned around and went over the road again. Fun and unique. I wouldn't say it's worth a long drive, but if you're headed west toward the Antelope Valley Poppy Reserve or something in the vicinity, take West Av. G. You probably won't recognize the tune as being from The William Tell Overture (The Lone Ranger Theme), but it's still pretty cool!",Craig M
40,A fun surprise!,"Our friends who live in Lancaster insisted that they take us on the Musical Road. We had no idea what to expect. What a kick! It's kind of in the middle of nowhere and it's just the left lane of a two-lane road. You have to listen carefully to ""catch"" the tune. I wanted to do it over and over again but I wasn't driving. Maybe someday...",Cathy B
50,Somebody was very clever!,If you very carefully drive at exactly 5 miles an hour. With the window down. You will actually hear the music of the wind caused by your cars wake. Its really neat and extremely clever!,David L
50,So cool,Its such a different experience.I really enjoyed it here. Everyone should try it out. Plus you go in the opposite lane.,Adam G
50,Very Cool,Try to do it if you are in the area. It is left over from a car commercial in the 90's. Plays a classical song but you MUST be driving exactly 50 miles per hour. It is in the far left lane so you need to get over when you see the sign.,Jeff M
50,Something Unique and Fun to Visit,This road is a unique and fun place to visit. Music is played when you drive over the notches in the road (best at 50 MPH) that creates man-made road noise to the Lone Ranger theme song tune.,MrandMrsB0411
50,Just plain fun!,"Well worth the time for a side trip if you're in Lancaster. We drove the road twice at two different speeds, could definitely hear music. This was good pure fun!",Jim B
40,Driving thru,"On our way home from the poppy preserve, we decided to find musical road. If coming from the preserve you will have to do a u turn. The signage for musical road is only on one side so the first drive by we missed it. When we were coming from the other direction we saw the sign and basically stay to the far left. It is a small section but it is a unique experience. However, it is a detour to some place or coming from some place.",Tucuxii
40,Fun and a unique experience.,"Our family really enjoyed driving down this short stretch of road multiple times. We experimented with slow, faster, windows down, windows up, etc. it was a lot of fun. The kids didn't recognize the tune and I believe the road is worn down causing the music to be flat. But we all enjoyed the concept of a musical road. It made a fun interlude during our trip. We recommend this unique opportunity to folks traveling in the vicinity.",Lynda H
50,Always Fun and for us A Must Repeat to drive the Musical Road,"We were in Lancaster and staying at the Best Western. Since its just a five minute drive (two freeway exits north) to get to the road that has the Musical Road on it, we loved driving it again. Its fun to do.",mini
50,Nothing else like it,"Fun to drive over the ""musical"" road and listen to a snippet of the William Tell Overture. We traveled it twice and varied our speed to hear it differently. You'd have to go well over the speed limit to hear it the way it normally sounds.",Carole A

She was tickled, and it was fun.There's no traffic to speak of, so you can do it as many times as your little heart desires.It's not a whole song, but enough to make you think about why more roads don't make music as we drive over them.I highly recommend the Civic Musical Road!",email4saundra1
50,A must experience,"I have gone through this road so many times. It's very interesting. You have to experience driving the rough road that is making music.

40,Unique & fun,"Civic Musical Road, Lancaster, CALocated at 3187 West Avenue G, Lancaster, CA 93536This was a fun outing during our stay in Lancaster, CA. It doesn’t take a lot of time [depending on how many times you ride the stretch ~ lol.] But it is a unique activity and good for adding to happy memories of a visit. An additional oddity is that for some reason the designers set it up to play ‘off-key’ … adding to its being quirky, cute, fun, good for a chuckle, etc.It is located on Avenue G between 30th Street West and 40th Street West, in the far left lane of the westbound side of the road. You can even preview it by visiting numerous videos on Youtube and Facebook.According to Wikipedia, there are musical roads in other countries as well… China, Denmark, Japan, San Marino, & South Korea. But this is one of only 2 we’ve discovered in the USA. The other is in New Mexico. We hope to check that one out next.When you are in the area, it’s an amusing “something to do”.

40,Rare Experience to Ride On Musical Road,"Originally intended to be an integral part in a Honda advertisement several years ago, this is actually the SECOND edition, not the original. The original strip was such a curiosity magnet that nearby neighboring homes found the high volume of traffic a major problem with disturbing of peace, road wear, etc.There is a set of rumble strips embedded in the pavement that will play the ""William Tell Overture"" is you drive about 55 m.p.h. over it. This newer location is just north of Lancaster, at Avenue G, where there are no nearby homes and basically no traffic issues. In fact the roadway is in great condition. By the way, there are a total of 6 Musical Roads in the world, 2 of them being in the U.S. The other American musical road is in New Mexico, on historic Rte. 66, which was actually built by National Geographic as an aspect of their production of a special documentary, ""Crowd Control."" The roadway in New Mexico has ""America, The Beautiful"" featured, but in recent times the road has become 'out of tune.' No plans to spend taxpayer road funds on maintaining this road as it concerns the embeds, only basic repairs for normal roadway wear and tear, like potholes, etc. To learn more about how the roads are constructed or what it is like to drive over the tuned rumble strips you can go to YouTube and search musical roads.",Colleen T

50,Cute and Fun!,There are a few musical roads through out the world. One of them is here in the Antelope Valley. Short span of road Try different speeds to hear the musical tune. 55 mph - 60 mph is ideal to hear the tune. We gone around a couple of time just because it is fun and unusual.,Chamorrita T
50,Fun at all speeds,"We have driven the Musical Road a few times. It was on the way to a restaurant we were headed to, so we opted to hear the road again. We have tried it at various speeds and it is fun. The kids will like it.",Laura D
50,Don't miss this if you are in the area.,This is a funky type of attraction. A tune plays for several seconds as you drive along the road. Supposedly one of only two roads in the world like this.,Steve R
50,"So Fun To Hear the Music - The Musical Road, Lancaster, CA",We drove the Musical Road. Its really fun to listen to the music as one drives the road We liked it so much we did it a couple of times. The road is well marked. The music is in the left lane of the highway. Its really fun and was a short drive from where we were staying in Lancaster for the night.,mini
40,Good human entertainment,Get off hwy 14 on ave g. Turn toward fox airport. Look for signs. Make sure you are going 55mph or so. Go back and do it a couple more times.,Amy H

40,KB,The kids love it. When we have friends from out of town in we take them out to this attraction. If you visit appollo park its a half mile away from music road but you can hear the music as the cars travel down the road,Kyle B
50,Musical road,Only one in the us. Gotta drive over it at the right speed 55 to get to sound right. Gotta have talent to know how to cut the asphault.,dmstev

10,Are You Kidding?,"Interesting idea, exactly how much did it cost? We drive this road every school day. It's HORRIBLE, off beat and out of tune. It starts out sounding like Jingle Bells, then almost has some correct notes only to end in completly incorrect ending notes! A waste of money!",Where2nowCa
30,Change,Since they moved it and changed the song. Just not as good as it was before.Should of stayed with the nicer sounding song.,Lora C
40,Fun thing to experience,"Not much to this, you drive your car around 55-60 mph and your tires go over the grooves in the road and play notes to a song that you can hear as your driving! You got to do it at least once!",Rob B
40,"Fun, but short","This was a fun little side trip while I was in Lancaster, CA. It was easy to find, but I would have liked some sort of sign or something to tell you how to best experience the road. As it was, I researched it on line, then tried it (probably about six times, I admit!). At first I went too slow, then sped up to the speed limit, then a bit more, then a bit more... It definitely got better the faster you went (though I am not advocating speeding!). I didn't really recognize the tune as ""the Lone Ranger theme"" but it was interesting. I might have ""heard"" the tune a bit better if the road was a little longer. I drove a colleague over it the next day and she enjoyed it--she had no expectations, and I'd already ""rehearsed"" it. Fun, but know it only lasts about 10 seconds (and less the faster you are going).",VAfoodie2014
40,Stay on Avenue G,Such and fun little addition to your drive to Fox Field. This wouldn't be a bad idea on most streets for people to adhere to speed limits. Fun to check out.,CynJ22
50,Very Unique experience!,I don't believe that there is another place like this anywhere in the US! We are all familiar with the grooves in the pavement that cause some sort of tone. The grooves in this road actually play a familiar tune as your car travels over them.,Chris Z

40,2 mins,If your not from the area and traveling it's worth the couple min excursion off to do it. Very cool how they spaced it to make the music. We drove it twice because of a 6 year old that thought it was really cool.,Sconietraveler
30,It's cute...,"Ok this little patch of road was great and really neat when they first did it off of Ave K! Once they moved it, it never sounded the same and that's so sad. It's a novel idea and interesting for a couple times.",952candicel
30,An off key version of the Lone Ranger theme song,"I've done several trips down this road and although it's something cool to do with out of towners, it really isn't all that spectacular. From what I understand, Toyota actually built the original Musical road on Avenue H or I, and it was actually on key if you drove over it in a Toyota at exactly 55, but the city ended up tearing it up and ""redoing it"" over on Avenue G because they kept getting complaints from homeowners in the area resulting in a mediocre job. I've done it at several different speeds (including 100+ in a Maserati (😉) and the slower you go, the more off key it is, and the worse it sounds. If you're going to try it out, I'd recommend going about 70-80. Have fun.",Ken_R265
40,Fun!,"Super fun! Drive 55mph, keep the windows up for the best sound, and enjoy the Lone Ranger theme song! Uturned and tried it a couple of times!",gtowntxmom

40,WOW! How Cute!,I was so excited by this unique patch of asphalt that I begged my husband to turn a around to encounter it a second time. It was such a HOOT!,alicerabbit
40,Kind of cool and unique,"What a unique experience to drive down a road and hear a classic tune! Was originally created for a Honda commercial. Just be aware that the ""tune"" is a little out of tune. But fun for visitors.",hpytravler67
40,Pretty cool!,"It's short, but really cool if you are in the area check it out its close to the 14 could be a quick maybe 10 minuets detour it's worth that!",Swank23

50,Lancaster California musical road,"My grandchildren love to go over the musical road. We go over at least twice. It is also fun to take out of town guests, adults as well as children. It is located on Avenue G and is on the way to Apollo Park and William J Fox Airfield.",johnjerim
50,Honda musical Road works,I was just there yesterday with my big truck and I couldn't help but go over it twice. Amazing it's on concrete a regular Road with beautiful trees lining the area. It's not Disneyland but it's very cute free close to Apollo park for a second day or same day adventure.,Wiseguy98
40,Very cool idea,"Something out of the ordinary. Take a detour on Avenue G and hear your tires play out the William Tell Overture. The original musical road was on Avenue L but it was moved to a more remote location due to the number of cars making U-Turns on a busy residential street. The Avenue G music road sounds a bit off key compared to the original, but still a novel and fun experience.",jerjon
50,Good vibrations,Traveling down Avenue G just North of Lancaster can be both exciting as well as a little scary if you are not ready for the tires on your vehicle to start playing the Lone Ranger theme! One of only two spots in the World that you can experience this type of music. Well worth checking out!,HowieNui
50,Turn Down Your Radio and Have a Listen!,"I had first learned about this road when I was taking a driving class and my driving instructor directed me out here. I loved it that I took my siblings and family out when we were driving through the area.It's a fun little stop visit to just hear how it works, but do remember to follow with the speed limit or it sounds like noise if you go a little slow or too fast.Definitely something to check out!",reader_girl932
50,Roadtrip novelty -- kids loved it!,"Great road trip diversion for family while traveling Hwy 14. Quick novelty ""drive-thru"". Kids 8, 11, and 13 thought it was hilarious, as did parents. I've never seen/heard anything like this on the road. Not a destination attraction, but if you're driving by in the area, it's worth checking out! Turn off music in car, stay in left lane.",darbcat5
40,"Pretty cool, it made us laugh.",We heard about it from fellow hotel guests and a local at a store. It was actually horizontal furrows in the road that are spaced to play the Lone Ranger theme song as your tires go over them. In order to get the right song tempo you would have to go about 100 mph. We did it at 45 mph first and then did it again at 65. It made us laugh. Good free fun.,jb34756

As you are cruising down the road at an optimal speed of 55 mph in the number 1 lane, you take your passengers by surprise the minute the musical road. The tantalizing tone is so fun to hear. The first time I went down this road I quickly went back and went down the road at least two to three times just to hear it again. If you haven't done this yet, I encourage you to do it again!",MrandMrsB0411
50,So freaking cool.,My uncle told me to stay quiet and next thing you know I can hear music playing as we are passing this street. This is amazing and I have never seen anything like this!,Graice C

40,What a fun find,"This was a lot of fun and it does play a tune, you can not miss it, stay in the left lane and drive at 55, very cool idea and just a lot of fun. I heard of this off Trip Advisor and I ma glad we did not miss it.",Ranbud

40,Amusement,While visiting my parents in Lancaster I decided to see what the town has to offer. My parents had never heard of this and as it was a short trip from their residence we decided to visit one evening. We found this hilarious if only for a few seconds so we traveled the road twice. I wish the road was longer and that there were more of them around the country. Stay in the left lane.,Michelle P
30,Amusing,"Considering the fact that this attraction is rather original, it's worth the experience. For those of us who are not tech savvy, ""how do they do that?""",RLDrPH

50,Super Cool,"So I heard about this road that plays music when you drive on it but I didn't understand how. So while driving out that way, I decided to take my 7 year old niece. I rolled the windows down got in the far left lane and shouted out, "" here we go, listen!"" Well it wasn't what I thought. For some reason I thought I was like a recording of music but thats not it. Let me try to explain for those of you that just as clueless as I was....You know you're driving on the fwy then all of a sudden the sound of the road changes? Its usually the pavement variance. So that's what its like, except the sound of the road changes to the rhythm of a familiar tune, only for a few seconds though.. oh and you don't need to roll the windows down....Its pretty cool and my niece really liked it. We had to turn around and go again!",csthreatt
40,Fun and Quirky,The Musical Road is a fun and quirky boondoggle off the 14 freeway. It takes all of 20 seconds or so to drive but worth it just for the unique experience.,Crystal R

50,When was the last time you laughed your head off over good clean fun?,"Do you need a good laugh? Drive down this musical highway! It plays the William Tell Overture. You have to drive the speed limit to get it to sound right. That's where the fun comes in. You can go round and round and round, and no one will tell you you've had too many turns. It's a good laugh for all ages, and it doesn't jiggle you like a speed bump or a roller coaster.",Corinne M

40,Very fun!,I have taught my children to drive on this road. They love the music! It is a good way to brighten up your day!,Patty W
40,Very Neat Experience,Very cool. It only last a minute or two but it is actually pretty cool. I have never experienced something like this so I was glad I took a few minutes to check it out. It is only on the inner lane and is a short distance but as you drive over it you really can hear the music/tune. It was unique! I recommend doing the drive over it at least a couple of times.,Donna C
40,Take the Kids for a Joyous Ride,"You don't really understand what this road is about until you experience it. If you want to go for a fun little ride, then take the kids and let your car and the road play a tune for you. It's free, it's fast and it's fun!",EllieRKay
50,Got to love it,When I give directions to my house. I always send them down this fun road. Then we play name that tune. Good family fun,Melissa J

50,Traveling Music,"Musical Road just might be the most unique driving experience since Lombard Street in San Francisco. Going west bound on Ave. G, in Lancaster, you will come upon a section of the road that paved in a particular fashion. The engineers designed it so that if you drive over the grooves in the asphalt you will hear music.It only plays one song and you can only hear it going west. However, the faster you drive the more pronounced the music becomes. To my knowledge this is the only road in America with that unique distinction.So damn the speed limit (but drive safely), cut off your car radio, and enjoy the sweet (yet brief) road induced serenade that will have everyone in your vehicle hoot with excitement. And if the mood hits you....Sing along. There are no words, but I bet you know the melody.",BENelson
50,Musical Road a quick detour not to miss,"This is a fun 10 minute jaunt off the 14 freeway not to be missed. Great for all ages, but kids really love it!",elwt
50,Neat Experience,Why aren't there more roads like this in the world? The musical road was so neat. My other half thought we were going to a museum when I described the Musical Road to him. The music actually caught him off guard and he was so surprised. Wish we drove over it a few more times.Will do this again!,ExperienceMy31
30,I was expecting more...but might as well!,"Might as well check it out. I was expecting more than grooves in the road for my soundtrack. Sounds better the faster you go. I went twice-- only takes less than half a minute.Not far off the highway, so you might as well drive, listen and then continue on your way.",Summerasalifestyle
40,Singing Road,Enjoyed driving this road way and hearing the music coming from the tires running across the lines in the road.,dhphill55

50,Cool Drive!,"There were no highway signs for this, so you had to know the address. Just a mile west of the main highway. We drove it twice, as it was not busy and you could go up and turn around easily and try it again. The first time we went through, we started slowly and got faster. The second time, we drove at about 60 mph. As you drive along this road, with your radio off and your windows up, the theme for the Lone Ranger plays from the rumble strips on the road. The faster you drive, the faster the music plays. It is really an awesome little stretch of road, probably only about a half a mile long. It was also free to do.",Karen K
40,Musical Road in Antalope Valley,Pretty cool. When guest come into town this is a must. Love It!!!! This is not the original one but it is just as nice. Area seculded and close to a lake to take a picnic basket and enjoy some fishing and a stroll in the park,Debbie L
50,Super fun! Only 4 in the World and 1 in the US,Its a little quirky and fun and its totally worth it!! We went over it a few times and had a blast! If you like to do something a little different go for it! You can even here it when standing on the street outside of the car!,Mark-n-Chrystal
30,Fun quickie for out-of-towners,Fun to take unsuspecting out-of-towners and watch their reaction! The sound is ok - but it was better when it was on Ave K - maybe the time to put it in on Ave G was done quickly and not as thoroughly.,Kathy P
50,Only in Lancaster California,My kids and I enjoy this road very much. It makes them giggle. I hope they make another one and make it longer.

The grooves in the road create vibrations which exemplify thorough the car to create the sounds of a tune.I would recommend rolling the windows all the way up to get the best experience. You can try it multiple times at different speeds which will either decrease or increase the speed or rate of the tune.This is something that you can't just go and find anywhere.

The road is located off state route 14, also known as the Sierra Highway. There was light traffic on the street at this location on a Saturday afternoon around 5:00 p.m. When you have arrived at this location, stay in the left lane. I enjoyed listening to the ""music"" at around 50 miles per hour. Unfortunately, the grooves in the road which produce the sound only last for about ten seconds of travel.

30,The William Tell Overture Massacre - Minutes of Fun,"Legend has it that, long ago, someone grooved-up a road in Lancaster, CA for a car commercial so that, when a car drove over the grooves, the car's wheels sang out the famous beginning of the William Tell Overture. After the commercial was shot, however, the nearby residents complained about the ""noise"" from their musical road and so it was re-paved. But sometimes if you stand on the spot of the car commercial, late on a moonless night, you can almost hear the musical road still singing as a far-distant, sickly echo of the once grand overture.Well, the reason you can still hear it is that the city decided to groove another road further away from the complainy neighbors. And the reason it's only a sickly echo of the once grand overture is because they didn't groove it quite right. So it doesn't really play the famous beginning of the William Tell Overture. It plays something else sort of reminiscent of the overture: ""DahDahDah DahDahDah DahDah Dah Dah Dah"". At first it's funny, but after your family makes you go back and drive over it at different speeds, it gets less funny.Here's how to get the most out of the Musical Road. Get a little kid, in the three to six-year-old range, the cuter the better. Tell them that if they say the magic words, the road will sing. (I'm not going to make up your magic words for you, just try and be creative). Exit SR14 at Avenue G going West in the left-hand lane and get your i-phone ready. Accelerate to about 55 mph. As you pass 30th Street West, you've got just over 1/2 mile to go - 30 seconds. In about 15 seconds, prompt the kid to say the magic words and then Video their cute little face as the whole car vibrates loudly with a massacred beginning to the William Tell Overture.
