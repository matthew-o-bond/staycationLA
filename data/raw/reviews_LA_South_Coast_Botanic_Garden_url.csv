50,Garden Walks with Family,"This is my second time visiting the beautiful South Coast Botanic Gardens. The gardens are so impressive and so local to the region. I was able to learn so much about the variety of landscape designs. The staff is friendly, the grounds are clean, parking is easy, the event center is spacious and they have added a great food stand that is chic and blends beautifully with set up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelproQ
40,beautiful nature setting in residential area,"This is a very large (i think 37 acres) garden. It's not a formal garden, but more a natural setting with great walking paths and ample seating areas. You can bring your own food and have a picnic or buy something from the small food store. Use the map because you could get lost, its so big. We got a annual membership as a gift and it's really a good buy if anyone is interested. It also includes several other gardens in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viperamd64
50,Beautiful Gardens...,I love going to the gardens...so beautiful! Everything is so well kept...I see photographer there most if the time... Beautiful wedding venue... Peaceful... Great bathrooms...free parking...Get a membership so worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,"A great place to stroll, relax and learn","The South Coast Botanic Garden is a treasure! A super place for all ages to come and visit. If you have young ones - bring a stroller - so you can meander along the many paths that wind over the (literally) ""Rolling Hills"". Stop at the children's garden - regardless of your age - it is simply enchanting!Locals are known to get a subscription so they can take advantage of the courses and events that seem to happen daily. But, also know that that they are members to the garden ""consortium"" where over 300 other venues participate. Thus, a subscription to this venue is honored at many others. (We were so pleased and surprised to learn this little tidbit!)A few rules so that you are prepared - 1) No animals except for service dogs 2) No loud music- it is meant to be tranquil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Nice walking,Beautiful gardens with plenty of walking paths. They also have a trolley. Nice little garden for the kids. Get a schedule of all the events. Plant shows and concerts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7909NUrichardd
50,A green oasis in a overly big city,An unexpectedly green and serene garden like setting in city more known for asphalt and concrete. Worth the short drive from the 405 or even better just up the hill towards Palos Verdes from the Pacific Coast Highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UltimoPatriarch
50,Lovely garden,"This garden which was built on landfill has many different areas to explore. There are paved paths that are wheelchair-accessible. The majority of the paths are dirt, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahaM8720GZ
30,nice place for a stroll.,My wife and I recently moved into the area and decided to visit. Although it was a rather warm day we didn't find the amount of flowers and fauna that we were expecting. I can only assume that this is really a seasonal situation here in order to capture the right flowers and plants that will be in bloom. Overall the grounds are lovely. Bring good sturdy walking shoes water and a hat. Will come back here again when we have some rain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5856OOdavidg
30,A Good Visit,"Visited in mid August. This is a large park. A number of the sections that are in the front of the park are well cared for like the cactus garden, the rose garden and the fairy tale houses. The fairy tale section is so very nice for young children. While there, the gardens had a fairies & troll theme going on. I walked the entire road/ trail that the tram would take as well as some of the other trails. This part was long. It was a warm day so be sure to bring along some water. I did and was glad since I didn't find any stands along my walk to purchase any & didn't find any water fountains except at the entrance. The map seems to say a tram might be available, but I didn't see any running during my visit. I'd recommend asking at the booth when you buy your ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virginia2002
50,Amazing bliss here!!,I have passed this place a lot coming down off Palos Verdes Peninsula. We finally made it!! The grounds are amazing and very tranquil. Some friends went to Mother's Day there and had a blast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
40,Tranquil - and sunny!,"Our most recent visit to South Coast Botanic Garden was in the summer. Much of the garden is without shade, so the sun can be a bit intense. The garden closes at 5pm, I believe, so a later evening visit isn't possible. The garden couldn't be any easier to visit, no lines at the ticket counter and no crowds. It's also very pretty, I would suggest a spring visit if possible. They often host plant sales which can contain fun finds. They sometimes have kid's activities, Fairies v Trolls on our visit. Oh, and the admission fee is extremely reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ojerio
50,Pure freakin' bliss,"My visit to SCBG was a top highlight of my trip to Southern California. Obviously if you love flora you don't need a ton of superlatives to know why a place like this is so wonderful, but the care & artistry on display everywhere was really impressive, & you can tell they take a lot of pride in being a center for learning & community. Thank you so much for a gorgeous day. CR",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clarktown_USA
50,Beautiful!,"A short drive off Crenshaw, parking is free and very easy. You buy your tickets (senior discount $6) and enter in. A tram ride for the one mile loop is available for an extra fee of $5. The map brochure can be a little confusing (and I minored in Geography in college). Flowers and plants are sorted into areas. Don't miss the fragrance garden (but don't accept the tour). Special programs are often presented for the children and weddings happen frequently (watch out for equipment and workers setting up). BTW, the workers were very nice and helped us find a short way to the handicapped parking area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499renev
50,Impressive!,"We've driven by this hidden gem a number of times and not really noticed it because it has a very unassuming entrance. However, we wanted to go somewhere on Easter that was outdoors and beautiful, and we chose this place. We're so glad we did! It is larger than you would think, and there is quite a bit of walking to see all or most all of it. The most developed and most beautiful areas were the cactuses and the roses, at least that we saw. These gardens were beautifully sited and planted, and there was obviously great care in achieving incredibly beautiful specimens. The plants seemed so healthy and vibrant. Some of the back areas were less cared for, like the orchard and the vegetable garden. It would be nice if some of the back areas had as much attention as the close ones; I was really looking forward to inspiration from those areas, but it was not to be. There are several amazing picnic areas, so if you are in the mood to picnic, you would not be disappointed! There was also a children's area which looked great, but we didn't spend any time there as we had no children with us. Overall, this Botanical Garden is not to be missed as it has been beautifully managed and tended, and we will definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodToGoGirl
40,Great Place for a Relaxing Stroll,"First, it was a Tuesday-Free Day, so that was a surprise bonus. This a very large and delightful garden that is particularly suitable for families with children of all ages. Wide, paved walkways and lots of OK-to-Touch displays. Even in February when most plants were not blooming or even emerged, there were still plenty of things to see. Especially liked the ""senses garden"" filled with aromatic plants and other showy botanicals to see and touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kumtux
40,Natural and Beautiful,"I have been to many Botanic Gardens in Southern California, and SCBG is the top ones because I'd its size, tranquility, singing birds, rich plants and, flowers for each season.The lake area is still under construction. Wish the lake could be restored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Differences
50,A 2 or 3 hour of relaxation and nature.,"This is a lovely place to spend 2 or 3 hours of enjoyable beauty. The Garden is large, but not huge. There are many types of local botany, with rose gardens and other flowers. There is a small lake where you can picnic. You don't need special clothes or shoes, but comfortable walking shoes will make the visit more enjoyable. If you are visiting the South Bay area of Los Angeles County, this would be a great place to drop by on your way to visit some of the other treasures of the area. This is a great place for a romantic walk for two, or for a family with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfS7339XG
50,This Garden is NOT in Palos Verdes Estates. It's in Rolling Hills Estates,"Great botanic garden. Fun place to go either alone or with family. It is, by the way, in Rolling Hills Estates NOT Palos Verdes Estates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrimoin
40,Awaken your senses!,"Located on Crenshaw Boulevard in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the 87-acre South Coast Botanic Garden is a stellar example of how creative land reclamation can produce a natural treasure of amazing beauty - strange but true, these gardens were laid out over a garbage landfill!Apparently, the area where these gardens now stand was once covered by the Pacific Ocean! When the ocean receded, a sediment called diatomite was left behind. Diatomaceous earth has various uses as an insulating or strengthening additive in construction, as also for filtration applications.In the early 1900s surface mining of this area started, which eventually went on to become the more destructive open-pit mining. When mining output declined in the mid-1950s, the mining company sold the diatomaceous earth mine to the County of Los Angeles, which put the site to use as a temporary garbage landfill.The turning point came in 1961, when civic minded citizens headed by Frances Young persuaded the county to use the site for a botanic garden – in effect the South Coast Botanic Garden has traversed the distance from mine to sanitary landfill to garden.After the trash was contoured and covered with three feet of topsoil, the planting of the gardens started with over 40,000 donated plants. The collection has since grown to be in excess of 200,000 plants, representing 2500 different species from locations as far away as southern Africa, the Mediterranean and Australia!The gardens are structured into many areas of interest, each with its own unique appeal. They include the Dahlia Garden, the Mediterranean Garden which also showcases coastal California plants, the Children’s Garden, the Banyan Grove with its massive tangled roots, the Desert Garden that features cacti and other succulents.The Garden for the Senses is very special, encouraging visitors to enjoy flowers and plants by smell, sight, touch etc.,The Fuchsia Garden features fuchsias and other shade-loving plants. The aptly named WaterWise Garden features trees and shrubs that do not require much water.The Rose Garden with over eighty rose varieties is a riot of colour and makes for a fascinating centerpiece. The Display Greenhouse has a range of tropical plants such as Orchids, Crotons, Anthuriums, Begonias and Adeniums.The Japanese Garden/Koi Pond is a particularly restful area – the shrubbery, the relaxing water sounds, the brilliantly coloured koi fish darting in the pond – calm and serene is an understatement.Do make sure to visit the Gift Shop that has a range of interesting items including hand crafted jewellery, though a tad high priced.Pets, alcohol and nicotine products are prohibited within the Gardens.Picnics are permitted in designated areas of the Garden. Even better, so are weddings and other celebrations – a wedding here would be quite a sublime, once in a lifetime event. On a more sober note, memorial services are also allowed in venues such as the Amphitheater and the Koi Pond Patio.The South Coast Botanic Garden is open 9am to 5pm on all days with the sole exception of Christmas Day. Admission charges for adults is $9 per head and for seniors (above 62, so we qualified!) it is $6. Parking is free and extensive.Do give yourself at least half a day if not more to experience this restful urban oasis and awaken your senses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,Very nice garden to visit....in cool weather,"We took our granddaughter to the garden so she could participate in the ""Fairies vs Trolls"" game that is popular during the summer months. There is plenty of parking close to the entrance. Admission prices vary but there are discounts so check the website to see which one might apply to your group.It was an unusually warm day in August and, although we were dressed appropriately, it was a hot visit. Be sure to bring some water with you! The game seemed straightforward but the map supplied isn't to scale and is confusing to follow. This wasn't just us; everyone we encountered during our hunt felt the same. Even the gift shop attendant said the map is lacking in many ways. At any rate, we found many of the Fairy (our chosen team) locations and had plenty of beautiful foliage to observe while walking.There is a tram that operates as well for those that just want to see the highlights of the gardens from the paved paths. We also saw plenty of lizards, insects and interesting plants and trees. Well worth the visit especially if you go on the third Tuesday of each month: free admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonestarlizard
40,Wedding and reception 10/6/18,Went there for a wedding for my nephew and and his bride. The place is very well kept from what we saw. The staff was polite and handled the whole affair very well. And kept the standard visitors at a polite distance from the wedding party and held the venue open long after the gardens closed to the public. Congratulations to all for a job well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddeselle
50,Wonderful place,We got a deluxe membership from Groupon and we have visited here with the kids many times since then. This is one of our favorite places in the area so far. There is a Tram that operates on weekends that will drop off and pick up around the garden if you are not prone to hiking too far with some decently steep terrain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaacB1037
40,Pretty and different flowers,"It was a good garden to walk. It is big and has enough plants and flowers to keep you busy for a while. When we went they had the trolls vs fairiesWe saw lots of fairies in our walk, it made it over the top fun for my 7yr old. My 13 loved taking pictures and my 11 complained all the way from all the walking. Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
40,Beautiful place to visit,My sister got married here about 20 years ago so it was fun to see how it had changed. We went on a very hot and sunny day. I would suggest going when it is cooler since it is all quite exposed. Beautiful day and make sure to check out the little gift shop. You can also buy little plants which make great gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendy_PlettSunTours
50,Natures Beauty Exhibit,"We were visiting Family in Palos Verdes and looking for nature activity. We had passed the Botanic Garden before and investigated their openings and charges. The 3rd Tuesday of the month is Free Admission. There is amble parking. We checked in, made a donation, and picked up map of the gardens. There is a gorgeous rose garden with magnificient rose specimens. There is a smell and touch garden area to explore. There is an outer perimeter trail to walk and view various plants, shrubs, trees, and flowers. Most all of the specimens are labelled and which country they originated. Beleive this was all built on a land fill. You can enjoy beauty, walk the trails, and relax on benches located throughout the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lukeanthonywflorida
50,Fabulous Rose Garden,"I went to an afternoon tea here that was an appreciation event for donors. I was a guest of a friend. The botanical garden property has been here for many many years, however, the rose garden has been totally redone with both hard and soft scape that is beautiful and so welcoming. Although a lot of material was reused in the new design, it’s nothing like it was before. The CEO and other players are developing and presenting new and exciting ways to be involved in the property. They even have two family movie nights in July. The property is large but there is a tram to ride around. The rose garden is right in front and accessible. The gift shop is small but I understand improving with time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsPickle
40,Great walk especially 3rd Tuesday..FREE admission!,"Should walk through the gardens when the flowers are in bloom, its a little gem in South Bay. Will be surprised how much they have improved during the last couple of years and had planted so many different flowers, thanks to all the volunteers. I was a bit sad that the water pond and ducks were gone because of the dry season, but the rest of the garden are well kept. There are so may different species of plants, trees and flowers and the route is well signed. You can spend a couple of hours strolling and learning about the environment with all the children and family. You will not regret especially on 3d Tuesday when it is free for all. Plenty of parking and bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
40,Neighborhood Nature,"We had a wonderful time walking around the garden for a few hours, exploring, taking pics and spending time as a couple to stop and smell the flowers.87 acres- dirt and concrete paths easy to walk and lots to see along the way (bring water!). I haven't been to many botanical gardens so don't have a lot to compare to but seems like it is a work in progress and for anyone who does gardening in their own home it is a living, ever-changing space. My guess lack of rain and likely lack of funds has impacted it. Young rose garden but we did get to see some blooming. No lake.I have driven by this place for years and finally decided to see what it was and I am happy we did. If you are a local, make it a must on your to do list. If you are visiting the area and looking for a nature walk not at the beach, it is a good place to come for a few hours if not into anything strenuous or a commitment for the day like hiking in the Santa Monica Mountain etc..As a tourist, I don't think it will blow your mind, but I hope the local community will continue to support as I imagine places like this are treasures we should support and preserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyB121212
40,Nice visit among flowers and trees,"Great to convert the previous garbage landfill to the opposite. Sith over 2500 spices of plants there is always something in Bloom all season long. However, a feeling of just too many has been included in the design which make the garden is a bit unharmonic.But overall it is a nice visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Great for Halloween festivities,"Went with the family to do the garden's haunted treasure hunt. The four year-olds with us had a blast! We went on a warm day, so should have gone early in the morning to really appreciate the garden, but overall, it's a lovely spot for kids and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fewsl
30,A desert garden,"The South Coast Botanic Garden is a large property, however I found the online description of the garden misleading. This is predominantly a cactus and succulents / natives garden. If you are not a lover of drought-loving plants, you can skip this attraction.In particular I went to see the rose garden as the David Austin website states this is a good garden in CA to see English roses. I found the newly-planted rose garden a big disappointment - very small and with only one hybrid of DA rose! Most were standard hybrid teas - nothing worth paying to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej
30,Scenic stop,While you are in the Palos Verdes area drive a bit inland and explore the South Coast Botanic Garden's 87 acres of plants. Nice place for a stroll among the thousands of plants on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
30,casual visit to the garden,"This was my 1st time visiting the Southcoast Botanical Garden because I am a member of the Descanso garden, so I was able to get in at Southcoast garden for free. Southcoast botanical garden is an OK place to visit. It is a pretty big garden from area perspective. The garden is emphasizes on California native plants, however, there are some plants other from other part of the country as well from around the world. However, there are not many family like activities compares to Descanso garden. So, I rate it as 3 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741mannyt
20,Good to see recent redevelopment projects,"As first time visitors, we enjoyed the planted areas near the entrance gate, and a glimpse of the rose garden beyond the construction barriers. We were disappointed with the overgrown and unkempt conditions prevalent through much of the rest of the grounds we viewed. Visitors should be warned of these conditions prior to entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GyrFalcons
40,Earthy grounds,"Nice place to visit to see a variety of plants. Relaxing to walk through the garden paths. Sometimes see ducks. Shakespeare in the Park has been there, concerts and weddings. Nice to bring small children. They offer classes there too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724kathleenb
50,"Tranquile gardens for walking, hiking or meditation","Come and visit the newly created Rose Garden!!This 86 acre hidden gem is a place for children to explore at the children's garden, or create arts and crafts at the ""Kids Corner"" events, or take long walks among the shade trees. Adults can see an abundant variety of native plant species in the Mediterranean Garden & Succulents and Cactus in the Cactus garden. Great place to sit and relax or to take a vigorous walk or hike. Perfect for multi-generation families or solo visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smph5
40,Good For an hour or two,"I am guessing this place was established at least 60 or 70 years ago by the size of some of the trees. It is a huge garden but well laid out with roads and sign posts so you should not get lost. Actually it is too much to walk all the way round unless you have a whole day and are pretty fit. Fortunately there is a little tour train in operation at the weekend but I had to walk so could only see a limited area. Most of the exhibit areas including fuschia garden, dahlia garden and vegetable gardens are all close to the entry. It is famous for a desert and cactus garden which is quite large but easy to get to. It is very worthwhile with a lot of major specimens. The Japanese garden is not bad but does not have the absolute precision the Japanese would use. Right now the place is undergoing a huge transformation including an expansion of the desert area, new rose garden and rebuilt lake. This is supposed to be complete now but I would estimate more like mid 2018 before everything is really complete. So not bad for an afternoon of fresh air but can look forward to some good things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia
50,Commune with Nature,"i visit the gardens almost every weekend. The flora gardens are ever changing and the staff and volunteers keep it in Top condition. There are special exhibits and displays Frequently. Recently a model train display set up write several train clubs showing their best miniature scenes. The are music concerts on the lawn or in the assembly hall and special education events like the visits of wolves and a lexture on their keystone species status. There are hiking trails trough the woods and I go with friends, family or solo for 3-4 miles of varied trails. Some are slightly technical, all are a great walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ononru262
40,Always something in bloom,Enjoy the beautiful myriad flower beds in bloom. Good hikes all around the garden. Well maintained cactus garden.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drKSG
40,Tranquility and a lovely walk,A tranquil garden offers a lovely walk around the garden. It was January so there was not all the possible blossom. However we enjoyed our walk there. We would have enjoyed a cup of coffee or soda should there have been a café. The ladies in the shop were most friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanneleHenry

50,Beautiful Spring Day in the Gardens!,I'm from Indiana so it was especially enjoyable to walk among so many spring blooms in March! I spent over 3 hours hiking through the several acres of many varieties and species of trees and plants. Several areas are under construction so I will need to visit again to enjoy the new gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimcE8895KX
50,Beautiful Cherry Blossom's are in Bloom!!!,"I’ve always wanted to see Cherry Blossom trees in full bloom and was so surprised to find out they were on my way to Newport Beach. We were vacationing in Manhattan Beach and I was looking for things to do when I discovered a ‘Cherry Blossom Festival’ at the South Coast Botanic Gardens. It was on a day when we couldn’t attend so we decided to drive over and check out the trees.Originally the Cherry Blossom trees were gifts from Japan where over 200 species can be found throughout the country. A small number of cities in the USA have received them as gifts from the Japanese government. They are also not easy to catch blooming as they only last one week. Amazingly the South Coast Botanic Gardens has many trees and are they ever gorgeous!We visited on March 6, 2017 when the trees were in full bloom. I must say that I have not seen these beautiful pink flowers anywhere else in the world except Tokyo. They are a beautiful sight to behold.The gardens are easy to find, easy close parking and I also liked their reciprocity program with my local Morton Arboretum of which I am a member. We had free entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahsBackstage
30,Great little place for locals,"Got a yearly membership for our family. We were expecting a lot more flowers and green, but didn't find it here. But this is LA so it makes sense. Huge place. Great for locals to come and walk around. Good place, but can't recommend it for people who have to drive more than an hour to get here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1sapan
40,Solitutude,The gardens are located in a quiet section of the PV peninsula. The gardens provide a nice quiet respite from the busy South Bay Area with its traffic along PCH.

50,We used to have a bird class that met here...,"there's an owl in the trees in the parking lot. at least there used to be. the gardens are charming. well worth a couple of hours at least. i'm not sure if they let u bring in food, but this would make for a delightful place to picnic. when you need a break from the city, the tranquility that can be found here is well worth the drive up the hill, make a day of it and drive around the peninsula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/298justinp

50,Urban Oasis,"This has long been one of our favourite places in Southern California, and is one place we always visit when we are here. 87 acres of garden, some formal, much of it quite wild. You can lose yourself for hours. The guide allows you to easily find your way around the garden. There is a nice gift shop, and a nice touch is that plants are for sale at the shop. Located in the beautiful Palos Verde Peninsula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardwK1705JY
50,The Hidden Gem,This hidden gem is a must see when you are in the Los Angeles Area. The well maintained trees and gardens offer a relaxing moment away from the concrete world. The staff and volunteers make this a place to enjoy for everyone who comes in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220LauraL
50,Great Pumpkin Hunt,"The South Coast Botanic Garden is a favorite of ours--including my almost-4-year-old granddaughter. We've enjoyed not only the lovely gardens and spectacular trees but also concerts and picnics on the ""upper meadow."" Yesterday, we had great fun with our little granddaughter finding the ten ""hidden"" pumpkins, each of which had a garden-related riddle (difficult enough to engage the grown-ups involved). We stopped in the gift shop for water and a popsicle--delighted with our adventure. The great pumpkin hunt continues through the first weekend in November.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N420YRbarbarak
40,A great venue for a wedding,"Just attended a wedding here. It is interesting, pretty in summer and fall, not so much in January when we went to check it out as a venue.

Very clean and wonderful . Price is a little steep but I guess it goes to the upkeep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Great for Birds and Flowers,"I had been to the South Coast Botanic Garden many years ago to photograph flowers. On a recent trip to Long Beach I had some spare time and wanted to get some bird watching done. Turns out the Botanic Gardens was just as good for bird watching as for photographing flowers. Hummingbirds are as common as honey bees here, Western Blue Birds, Red Tailed Hawks, and many other species. Highly recommended for strolling, birdwatching, or nature some get back to nature time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pipehorse
40,"Nature Transformed: From Open Pit Mine, Then Landfill, to Glorious Gardens","For those who lament the modern assault on Nature and depletion of natural resources, there is a lesson to be learned at South Coast Botanic Garden. Once an open pit mine, in the 1940s, then a massive landfill dump from 1957-65, today this pristine landscape contains some of the most beautiful gardens in all of the Los Angeles area.Today, 50 years after this place became a garden, it is that and so much more. On a regular basis the beautiful landscape hosts events, weddings and even art shows.On the day we visited there was glass art carefully placed around the themed gardens. In one meadow there were Ferraris on display. And in the large hall the Fuchsia Society was holding a plant demonstration and sale.While situated so near one of the nation's largest cities, what is especially surprising about the garden is how quiet and peaceful it is. Roam the 87 acres of rolling grounds and you will be embraced by Nature, Western Bluebirds and Hooded Orioles fill the trees.While not as large as the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia, or The Huntington Botanical Gardens in Arcadia, this garden is easy to reach throughout the LA metropolitan area and is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239ernies

The cacti garden was the most spectacular sight for me since I'm from Canada and haven't seen this many varieties and was amazed to see the hummingbirds feeding off the cacti flowers. It grounds very well kept and so wonderful to walk barefoot on their beautiful lawn by the information centre. The gift shop was lovely and it was peaceful to sit in the courtyard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyn111111
50,Japanese Festival & Nature Connects Art with Lego Bricks,"March 5th, 2016 was forecasted with light rain spread spuraticically throughout the day. My family and I still wanted to go, so we went prepared with umbrellas. Before going to the Gardens, we stopped in San Pedro to get delicious breakfast at Rex's cafe. It is a small place, so you are going to get cozy. The fruit bowls are a good size as a side with your meal. I get something different every time I go, this time I got the eggs Benedict, no sauce. My dad likes to get the special drinks, which are okay, some are better than others. Anyways the meals we had were satisfactory and filling; we were ready to walk the gardens. We went to the South Coast Botanic Garden for the Japanese Festivities but it worked out that Sean Kenney's Lego Art was there as well. March 5th, was a partially cloudy and sunny day, with a very light sprinkle during the mid morning and the afternoon. It came in handy we had umbrellas so we could still walk and talk pictures of what was around us. It was a very special day, an educational experience, seeing the different organizations that came out to perform at certain times for the Japanese Cherry Blossom celebration. Overall, don't be afraid of going out on a day that has some rain expected. You will discover things that happens when it rains. And it wasn't raining constantly all day long, the sun shinned, it got warm, the clouds were in and out, and it turned out great. That type of day makes the lighting great for pictures too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeonyRoze
50,Gardens and Legos,"We have been to the gardens before but the reason for this visit was the temporary exhibit of Lego sculptures. There are about 16 displays ranging in size from a life size gardener, lawnmower, and bison, to oversize humming birds, bees, and a rose. We found the Lego koi in the koi pond a fun twist. It was spring so the gardens were especially full and colorful. The exhibit closes May 8, 2016, so hurry.Note, the lake is currently empty for much needed restoration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,An all-year-round place to visit,"Though, as several other reviews have noted, the South Coast Botanic Garden may not be currently looking quite its best due to the prolonged Californian drought, it really does not deserve the criticism of being left unkempt and decayed. Maybe a couple of recent El-Niño-at-last? rainstorms helped, but when we went in early March there were lots of signs of attentive maintenance and renewal of fallow areas, with plenty of events planned both for adults and children. We got there in time for the tail-end of a show by the African Violet Society of America, apparently the world’s largest society devoted to a single plant species: who’d have thought it? Across the Garden’s 87 acres there’s a great variety of plantings and environments, from lush to desert. Particularly attractive when we were there were the Banyan Grove with its undergrowth of colorful Clivias just coming into bloom, and the delightfully imaginative “Garden for the Senses”, where a great array of herbs and other plants deliberately chosen for their olfactory and tactile as well as visual qualities are thoughtfully coded to enable visitors to indulge each sense as appropriate. Labeling in Braille too… now that IS thoughtful. Back in a few weeks for the Rose Garden coming into bloom, and there’s plenty else to keep one returning. The Senior admission of $6 each is a pretty good deal, but the annual Senior Family rate of $55 is certainly worth considering if you’re local to the RPV area and plan to come back as frequently as the Garden deserves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjbrown10
50,"Beautiful tree collections, wear good shoes to enjoy!","An early January visit means that several of the South Coast Botanic Gardens’ collections were not in bloom. Specifically, the fuchsia and dahlias were resting. I understand that this is the way it goes for gardens and was able to find one little fuchsia flower that made me very happy!Just past the Mediteranean Garden the succulents and cactus were a welcoming sight– exactly the kind of thing you come to California to see!The gardens map reads that if you have one hour to visit, “If you have a little more time and can explore further, you might want to walk the tram road. The loop is just under one mile and has some slight inclines; just right for a mild workout. Follow the green stripe on the road. There are many trails that bisect the Garden. You can take a side trip on one of the many trails, just be sure to wear comfortable shoes.” My advice: Do it!If you just stay in the gardens near the Visitor’s Center you won’t find this Buddha’s hand citrus tree in the Rare Fruit Orchard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeriByrum
30,El Nino drought,This garden could have been a beautiful place if not for the drought. Everything was dry. The lake was under renovation but we did not see anyone doing work around it. My pre school grandson commented that the lake turned into a puddle. We went on a Thursday afternoon for the Lego display. The grandkids were excited but it turned out to be a dud. It could have been a great afternoon if not for the place looking like it was abandoned by the gardeners for years. For the price of $9.00 for adults and $4.00 for kids 5 and up not so worth it. We will try again to visit once the drought is over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
30,"Beautiful, but visit when there's a discount rate","Beautifully laid out with walking paths, signage is helpful, ducks in pond, great photo opps, but expensive for a large family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
50,Great Staff!,"After my daughters summer camp, we excitedly walked and enjoyed the Botanic Gardens. The staff were very nice and let us explore wherever we wanted. We all agreed we loved that the staff weren't following us or watching us walk around. The only places the awesome staff were was either cleaning the bathroom, helping people, watering plants, working in the gift shop, etc. Luckily, there was a gift shop so we could mail one to my dad who enjoys this garden. It was a lovely way to spend our vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Italianfood770
40,Fun place to spend a couple of hours,"I visited South Coast Botanic Gardens today because I wanted to visit during their sweetheart stroll. I didn't see any Valentine's day decorations. Instead I saw booths for free snacks, wine and beer. I did see a grilled cheese food truck. I really would have liked to see the place decorated for Valentine's day. I did have fun even though my main purpose was to celebrate Valentine's day with my husband. Oh well!! I still recommend visiting and staying for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
40,South Coast Botanical Garden,"This is a hidden gem known mostly to the locals that live in the South Bay. My wife has been a docent there and we are both ""life time"" members. It's a great place to take children to see and learn about plants and flowers. There is a dedicated ""children's garden"" based on nursery rhymes with associated plants and flowers. They have a seasonal flower show and have biannual plant sales where you can purchase both common and unusual plants and flowers for prices much less than nurseries. They have many educational seminars and lectures that are free to the public on specific types of flowers, plants and trees. The area is very large with mostly gravel trails, so wear comfortable shoes. There is a duck and turtle pond in the lower section that is a favorite with young children who often bring bread to feed them. The upper area also can accommodate weddings amongst the flower gardens and they have a reception hall for catering events. The most interesting events are in the summer when they host their Shakespeare Festival where you bring your own dinner and beverages (alcohol allowed), blankets or lawn chairs and watch a Shakespeare play at sunset. Check their website to see what activities are doing on for the month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439kents
40,Lovely way to spend an afternoon,"Hadn't visited these gardens in over 30 years - the trees have grown. Spent a few hours strolling in this wonderful setting. Very nice day. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110Barbara
20,Drive Through Palos Verdes to Get There Was More Scenic,"It is not my intent to be unkind. I don't know if I was expecting Bellingrath or Butchart Gardens but as someone who enjoys the occasional nature photography excursion I would have been better served to have gone to the local Home Depot garden center. I understand California is in the middle of a drought and my visit was in November, but dead areas abounded and the gardens are overgrown and weedy in many places. The trails, though numerous, were unkempt. There is little excuse for this in a botanical garden. As another reviewer said the lake is under repair and dry. Perhaps November was not the best time to visit. The welcome building and adjacent grounds were first class and enjoyable (except for the weeds which I found very off-putting). Parking is spacious and free. However, on a brighter note, the drive through Palos Verdes getting to the gardens was quite nice and the highlight of the trip. I highly recommend a day trip driving around this spectacular peninsula",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Narykids
30,Good walking trails,"My husband and I came here for the first time this weekend and were disappointed that the lake was drained and under construction (I hadn't read the ""garden updates"" section on the website where it warned of that). The lake was one of the main things we wanted to see. The garden has a multitude of plants, trees and flowers, which are very nice, but much of it appeared dry. It's a nice place to walk around, but I think I personally enjoy the grounds of the LA County Arboretum much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaBCalifornia
40,Wide variety of very interesting plants on display.,We went on a very hot day in September and were soon wilting in the heat. Sadly some of the plants looked the same! End of the Summer after a drought probably did not present in the best circumstances. This place could be really fantastic in the right circumstances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
40,A Wide Assortment of Gardens in One,"I was especially attracted to the California Native Plants because they use less water (a major consideration during our drought) and they provide food and habitat for birds, bees, and butterflies. There's also a delightful children's garden that is based on nursery rhymes with plants to match. There's also a dollhouse, a butterfly garden and more. The Japanese Garden has a Koi pond and stone lanterns that are over 200 years old! The Rose Garden is amazing, with over 1,600 roses, including the David Austin English roses. The Desert Garden includes cacti, euphorbia, aloes, and other succulents. There's much more, but this should give you an idea of why you should come. You won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Lovely And Peaceful,Enjoyed the gardens. Allow a least five hours to walk and tour all the types of gardens. My favorite was the succulent garden and my husband liked the rose garden. Wear a hat and comfortable walking shoes. Bring water and snacks. The perimeter trail is about 1 mile. A mini vacation for a day. We had a wonderful visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaC381
50,a must place to see if you are in the area,"beautiful and peaceful place to visit if you are in the area, later on go to terranea resort or donald trump golf course both have a nice walking path and restaurant to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mardi777
50,A hidden gem!,"This was a lovely botanical garden, a combination of manicured flowered spaces and a rose garden, and wild, natural areas filled with native California plants, including cactus and succulents. There is a small admission fee, and you receive a map which you should look at! We didn't and missed some things such as the Japanese Garden. There are lovely paths and trails, you can get lost in the peace and quiet and beauty of the grounds. There is a picnic area adjacent to the gardens, a nice gift shop and clean restrooms. A must-see when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertar302
40,The water is off,This garden is casual. You walk around and see plants and vines growing together into beautiful floral arrangements. Wear your hiking shoes. Some of the paths are a bit rugged. A lot of the locals become members to use the paths for exercise. Worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatConwell
40,A Nice Garden!,"This garden offers much to see and experience for adults and/or children. It offers a place to unwind, relax and explore while surrounding yourself with nature. Truly a place to appreciate nature's beauty. There is an admission fee, but parking is free. The staff are also very friendly. Overall, the Botanic Garden is Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvillag
40,This place has really been upgraded,"I visited South Coast Botanic Gardens today. They have really upgraded the property. I purchased a deal on Groupon for $35.00 dollars. You get 2 passes for you and a friend to use all year and it gives you 2 free passes for friends to use (1 time only). The rose garden was beautiful and it is a huge property. I would highly recommend for a day of relaxing, exploring or for a good workout. Be sure to take your time as not to miss anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
30,Not the Huntington- but also cheaper!,"Those who gave this place a 5 star are either very easily amused, or settle for what's available in the area. Sorry but this place is Just Ok.The last time I came here was with the girls scouts in the 5th grade, and we had to pull weeds to earn a merit badge. Fast forward 30+ years, and here we are, strolling along the path of flowers and trees on a sunny Sunday afternoon.Its a small, but nice little botanical garden tucked near the hills between Torrance and Palos Verdes. This garden is not as grand as the Huntington LIbrary, but admission is also much cheaper (only $9 versus $23) too. So you do get what you pay for.Unlike the Huntington, there's not much to do, except view various types of floral and fauna, and one can definitely cover the grounds easily in a 2 hours. There's no cafe or private collection of any kind to view. I'm not even sure if you can bring food on the ground, although they have a tiny gift shop, and, I do see trashcans placed sporadically around the grounds.This place supposedly has a tram, but they can't seem to hire a driver, and probably because of budget, only run it after 1:00 on weekends.They offer a cell phone guided tour, but my Verizon phone wasn't picking up much of a signal.This place does offer groupon specials, so that's probably your best bet in coming here. Its a nice place for an outdoor event or wedding. They even have an indoor venue that can hold up to 300+ people.People come here with their kids, but for me, 2 hours was plenty of time for me to view the place. The staff doesn't seem to be overly eager to help. They are polite but pretty much that's it. Aside from one grounds keeper roaming around in his go-cart, I didn't interact with any staff member outside the admissions box office.Overall its an A ok botanical garden where its seen better days, when possibly their sponsors/benefactors did once care about the place. Free parking on site as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
50,Never Fails to Impress!,"OK, I will admit I am a huge nature lover, but that said…this place never fails to impress. I always come away filled with peace and calm and joy and wonder. Altho I live 150 miles away and was visiting relatives nearby, the first time I came I purchased a membership as I knew right away I would be coming back often. When we are in the area I have been known to come multiple times in a single day! Just as in nature, each day (and each time of day for that matter) at the Garden is a little different. The angle of the light, the ambient air temperature, which flowers are blooming, which birds are singing…all flow together to weave a tapestry of pure beauty and delight. One of my most favorite days was a day when it had just rained and nature put on a display of millions of shimmering 'diamonds' in the sunlight shining through the water droplets. A little history -- you may be surprised! This property was a diatomaceous earth mine and later a landfill. All the more astounding when you begin to explore the rich and diverse 55 acres and think about what it used to be and marvel at what it is now. There is truly something for everyone here. They hold a wide variety of classes and programs open to the public with discounts for members. I have seen infants in strollers all the way to elderly here…all thoroughly enjoying themselves amidst this rich panorama of pure, unadulterated nature. There are both paved and unpaved areas to explore. Some are formal, some are informal, some are forested. There is a delightful children's garden, there are both large and small lawn areas, and vast gardens of both cultivated and semi-native botanicals. There is also a somewhat small but nice gift shop and convenient restrooms as well. When I bring my young grandchildren they like to take turns choosing which path we should go on. One day they played for a whole hour and a half in a deeply forested area as I sat near them on the forest floor, all of us so nourished in soul to be in a place of such primeval beauty. Please if you have not been here come -- alone or with friends or family, but do be sure and come. I guarantee you will be back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl93463

30,If you live in the area and want a place to go once a month to hug some trees,"If you’re in the Palos Verdes area and hankering to be outside, or if you live in the area and want a place to go once a month to hug some trees (a pastime I wholeheartedly support), this is a good place to go. However, it isn’t a really well-organized display of discrete types of horticulture. For that, you need to go to the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena – although from the Palos Verdes area it’s at least an hour’s drive to Huntington and costs $23 versus $9 for South Coast. There is the obligatory Japanese garden; a children’s garden; a rose garden; and a cactus garden. The sensory garden was, meh. And then you’re left wandering around looking at trees. There are some interesting tree specimens, and a very good collection of fig trees, but you have to wander around to find things, and there aren’t many areas with theme designs, like discrete ecosystems. And there are not many smaller or showier plants. I didn’t see any plantings that display what grows well in the local environment. In fairness, I think the place has been really badly impacted by the drought: plenty of palms and conifers were looking decidedly worse for the wear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliethefirehorse
40,Mysteries to Explore,"My parents and I went last Monday, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the first time to this garden. The price to enter is not bad, $9 per adult, $6 for seniors. For two seniors and one adult that comes out to $21, about $25. If we were to go twice that is about $50 spent, so we got a membership. If you would like to, you can pay for membership and doing so is an easy process. The membership is $50 and the membership allows you to get in free the rest of the year. The membership also allows you to get into other Botanic Gardens. If you do pay for the membership, the process was quick and simple. You get a plastic card that can be scanned, two tickets for other people you would like to bring, and informational papers. One of the papers is about the other places you can get into. The day was sunny but not to warm and every so often there was a cool breeze. The place consist of many acres and maps and signs are provided. There is the option of doing a tram tour. It a beautiful place. Would love to go back and explore some more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeonyRoze
50,Botanic Gargden a hidden gem,"Located in Palos verdes, it is a wonderful garden to stroll and enjoy. A little off the beaten path but worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AltheaH2012
40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"My husband and I (who generally enjoy nature things) enjoyed a lovely morning here. Although it was December and many plants were not in bloom, there was still plenty to see. Love all the plant and tree identification labels. Wide variety of trees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsB742
40,Modest but quaint little garden in Palos Verdes.,"Our family of three wanted a day out in the fresh air so we sought and found the South Coast Botanic Garden. This is a tiny pearl of a simple, unpretentious garden in the middle of the Palos Verdes peninsula. Highlights: the cacti garden full of wondrous, other-worldly plants and the rose garden with its heavenly scents and minuscule hummingbirds darting about the many-colored blossoms. Read in another review that most of the scenic walk was at the front end of the park and found this to be true. Remember to visit the little shop on the premises. I bought a perfectly constructed tiny basket made from pine needles harvested from the botanic garden as a keepsake. We were delightfully distracted for almost three hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellemm02420
40,"Very Nice Gardens, Lots to See","We went here on a Friday afternoon on the way home from San Diego. The staff was very friendly and we were guided into a beautiful garden. We had a little trouble finding our way around so we got some extra exercise. I thought walking the path was a little boring. In the end, I wish we would have either had more time to explore the center of the park, or took what time we had to only see what was in the front. There was a LOT there. The Rose Garden was huge and in full bloom in November. Wow. There were very nice plants to keep your interest. Loved the garden and would love to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
30,You'll need a week to see it all!,"It was created from a former city waste dump about 20 years ago and cover more than 60 acres (about 25 hectares). The areas closest to the entrance are small compact gardens in a variety of styles - Japanese Garden, 'Touch & Smell' area for visually handicapped, desert garden, rose garden etc. As you move further afield the areas become larger and more naturalised. During the visitors' main season a bus runs a circular tour round the site.The long winding paths can be very tiring for elderly visitors and those with restricted mobility. Be sure to take a bottle of water on hot days! Rest rooms are located near the entrance and at the furthest point from the entrance, in between 'Keep Calm and Hang on!' Seats where one might rest and enjoy the surroundings are few and far between.Signage is very sparse. We made frequent reference to the free guide map to determine where we were and how to get to the next point of interest. Better route markers and a few 'You are Here' information panels would be a great help.Other than the specialised garden area, my impression of the remainder is of long woodland walks with not a lot to create interest. It's impossible to see the whole place in a day, pick a few key areas to enjoy and save the remainder for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6144QZstevem
40,Well done gardens,"Small charge for these gardens. We enjoyed all the flowers and different cactuses. Took our time and took lots of pictures. It is a little difficult to find, but, if you enjoy this type of attraction it is a good place to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel200905SL
50,Peaceful Gardens,"I have to say one of the reasons I like this garden is that it's so close to home. I can go every weekend if I want for a few hours. They have beautiful weddings there, events . It's one of my favorite gardens in LA area. FREE parking !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
40,My future wedding venue?!,"It's beautiful. There's lots to see and very nicely paved trails and signs. When I came here the drought surely did get to this place. I wanted to see the lake but it was completely dried out. I wish admission was free though like at the Fullerton Aboretum, but I understand it costs money to maintain a garden of this magnitude. Since it's not free I'll only be visiting on the third Tuesday of every month where admission is FREE! Great way to just take a stroll and let time fly by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starrysem
40,A little of everything,"A gem in the heart of Palos Verdes. Lots of flowering plants and butterflies. A large variety of specialty gardens: cactus, Japanese, rose, palm, conifer. My favorite was the children's garden with small scale buildings and figures. Plus more wild gardens with rustic paths. Allow several hours to see all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy984
40,Beautiful and serene atmosphere,I visited the South Coast Botanical Gardens in April of 2014. Everything was in bloom. I highly recommend this place because it has never been crowded any of the times I have been there. If you have a student ID it's only about 6 dollars to get in. It takes about 2 hours to walk around and see everything. You can also bring a picnic lunch and stop at one of the benches throughout the area and have lunch. There is a koi pond which is nice to sit and look at. It's very relaxing. There are plenty of portable restrooms throughout and a main restroom at the start of the trail. There is also a gift shop where you can but trinkets and snacks if needed. I would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
50,Beautiful Garden,"We have gone half a dozen times because we are members to a reciprocating garden. We have gone during different seasons, and on our last trip, we walked twice on the tram route (totalling 2 miles). The kids love the children's garden and the numerous koi ponds. The rose garden is huge and beautiful. It is a hidden treasure in Los Angeles. Finally, if you want to join a garden for its reciprocity benefit, this one is the least expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/formosangirl

What a great place!Manageable, fun paths to walk on, small and intimate gardens that are a great display of native habitat and plants. Totally exceeded what i expected and had a great time. didn't even get to see everything so i'll definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankc575
40,A Walk Through the Gardens,"This was my second visit, but first in a long time. The gardens are large and we only had a little over an hour, so didn't get past the ""Lake"" (more like a pond). Near the entry is a fairy tale garden which my niece enjoyed and a little beyond that, a cactus garden. The garden seems mostly native plants with some imported. Parts are more manicured and parts are less manicured and the terrain is rolling, but flatter near the entry. My brother-in-law says the trails continued farther beyond the area that we wandered through.This part of California can be hot, but since the gardens are at the base of the Peninsula, the nearby ocean cools it a little. Maybe the next time we will wander beyond the Lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
10,Disappointing.,"Horribly disappointed. It says it is a garden, I expected to see groomed, maintained areas. Only the rose garden and a few of the garden areas when you first enter seem to be maintained. It is still spring yet not many flowers in bloom. Gardens are sloppy and need to be weeded. Hardly any of the plants are marked with their names. Most of the area is an unkept wilderness like area, which is fine but not what it is billed as. The map is difficult to follow. The lake...swamp, is just that. You cannot see most of it becuase of the reeds, and what you can see is just mud. I would not go again, I can see all this for free with a drive to the mountains or a walk around the neighborhood to see more flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petiedogtravels
50,Wonderful respite from LA,"Every part of the LA Arboretum system is excellent. We (SF Bay Area folks who go to LA yearly) have been to all of the other parts of the system but had never made it to Palos Verdes before. It may seem a bit far considering LA traffic for many folks including natives.This is definitely a worthwhile spot. Remarkably quiet and I suspect underused. Huge swaths of gorgeous trees and plants. Some areas better cared for than others but in this period of serious budget issues for everyone, I would judge that the South Coast Botanic Garden is in better shape than many arboreta around the country (we belong to many and visit many more).We were not able to get around the whole garden and so missed quite a few specific collections.Plant labelling is just about non-existent and that's the only deficiency that I would note.Plenty of free parking. There is an admission charge.[Tho I respond to the length of visit question w/2-3 hours, in fact any length of visit is worthwhile.]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurealam
50,"Beautiful Gardens, peaceful retreat for a day...","The South Coast Botanic Garden is a wonderful day trip, my husband and I are ready to go back again because we only got part way around in half a day.

50,"Really lovely park, great staff","They have an extensive Children's garden and many family-related activities, in addition to really large areas of gorgeous plantings. (The rose garden, for instance, was in full bloom and very impressive.) They have a good website - check it out before you go to make the most of a visit. Plenty of easy parking the day we went - even though it was also the day of a special event (see below). The gift shop is small, but quite nice - with unusual, quality items. The park itself is quite large. They runs a few tours, check their website. The tram runs very infrequently and you should double-check the website ON THE DAY you are going, to avoid disappointment. (Evidently the tram is run by the locals, the park is run by a foundation - which has no jurisdiction over the tram operation?) We are going back soon and will be taking our visitors whenever possible. Annual Plant Sale (April): We just moved to the area and our first visit coincided with this event. It was well-attended, but not crowded (at l east around 10:30 am, although the checkout line seemed a bit long.) It was a large, but very friendly sale - the people who actually grew the plants were at each booth, to give you all kinds of info/help. The prices seemed very good and I assume the Garden got some portion of the proceeds? I also appreciated that they emphasized good looking drought-tolerant natives and especially those that attract wildlife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVShores

As soon as you enter there is a koi pond that you can sit next to and relax. We walked the entire gardens in a little over 2 hours. There is a man made lake with ducks as well as a rose garden with a large variety of roses. There is even a play area for kids. The cactus garden is pretty large. Admission is only $6.00 dollars for students and $8.00 dollars for adults. I would highly recommend this place if you want to spend a few hours with nature. This place was not crowded at all which made it even better. I have been to the Huntington library and this place is a much smaller version of that but well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
30,Nice Oasis for a Day Trip,"The often-overlooked South Coast Botanic Garden contains more than 150,000 trees and plants in its 87 acres, making it a worthy day trip for those who enjoy visits to the better-known Descanso Gardens and Huntington Library. Just to stroll the grounds, doing little more than gazing at the scenery, is incredibly therapeutic. Of course, there are rewarding directed activities as well: Gardening, birding and drawing classes are offered along with concerts, plant sales and lectures. You could do worse things to your psyche with the $8 admission cost than walking peacefully among the flowers at this ""jewel of the peninsula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler
20,"Yes, it's definitely on a landfill","This garden has so much potential, but it felt like the gardeners were either on strike, or absent altogether! It seems to be very untidy everwhere you go and there is the constant reminder that you're walking in a converted landfil. It could be that they went for the rustic nature look, or the fact that I went in the ""depths of winter"" but I still believe that the place could benefit with a lot of thought put into making it seem more tidy. Instead, grasses are left to overgrow, one seat had a plant growing through it, and some of the pathways badly need maintaining, especially in the ""Grasses"" section. One highlight was the ""Garden of Senses"" where a lot of thought had been put into the presentation and information. If only the rest of the garden was the same. The pond was muddy-dirty and full of large pampas-like grassses, which obscured most of it. Shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKertland
50,Beautiful flowers and plants are everywhere!,"I recently did a daytrip out to the Botanical Gardens with my 18 year old nephew and we had a great time. Our goal on this day was to take some nice pictures as we both have Canon Rebels and are working on our photography skills. This was the perfect place as beautiful flowers, plants, and trees were everywhere. We went on a Free day (every third Tuesday of the month) and went camera crazy. There are several specialty gardens: rose, sense, japanese, etc. In all, there are 86 acres to browse through so have good walking shoes, sunscreen, and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,The roses here are glorious.,"Go the right time of year, not Christmas. The entry garden is really wonderful. The cactuses are wonderful. The roses are amazing. This place is built over a landfill, which is interesting. It's a great place to bring children. It was $20 for four people. Bring something to feed the ducks, if you have children. It has a children's garden, which is cute. It's not a huge place, but little kids can get tired running around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaT_10
50,Garden Walks with Family,"This is my second time visiting the beautiful South Coast Botanic Gardens. The gardens are so impressive and so local to the region. I was able to learn so much about the variety of landscape designs. The staff is friendly, the grounds are clean, parking is easy, the event center is spacious and they have added a great food stand that is chic and blends beautifully with set up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelproQ
40,beautiful nature setting in residential area,"This is a very large (i think 37 acres) garden. It's not a formal garden, but more a natural setting with great walking paths and ample seating areas. You can bring your own food and have a picnic or buy something from the small food store. Use the map because you could get lost, its so big. We got a annual membership as a gift and it's really a good buy if anyone is interested. It also includes several other gardens in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viperamd64
50,Beautiful Gardens...,I love going to the gardens...so beautiful! Everything is so well kept...I see photographer there most if the time... Beautiful wedding venue... Peaceful... Great bathrooms...free parking...Get a membership so worth it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
50,"A great place to stroll, relax and learn","The South Coast Botanic Garden is a treasure! A super place for all ages to come and visit. If you have young ones - bring a stroller - so you can meander along the many paths that wind over the (literally) ""Rolling Hills"". Stop at the children's garden - regardless of your age - it is simply enchanting!Locals are known to get a subscription so they can take advantage of the courses and events that seem to happen daily. But, also know that that they are members to the garden ""consortium"" where over 300 other venues participate. Thus, a subscription to this venue is honored at many others. (We were so pleased and surprised to learn this little tidbit!)A few rules so that you are prepared - 1) No animals except for service dogs 2) No loud music- it is meant to be tranquil.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Nice walking,Beautiful gardens with plenty of walking paths. They also have a trolley. Nice little garden for the kids. Get a schedule of all the events. Plant shows and concerts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7909NUrichardd
50,A green oasis in a overly big city,An unexpectedly green and serene garden like setting in city more known for asphalt and concrete. Worth the short drive from the 405 or even better just up the hill towards Palos Verdes from the Pacific Coast Highway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UltimoPatriarch
50,Lovely garden,"This garden which was built on landfill has many different areas to explore. There are paved paths that are wheelchair-accessible. The majority of the paths are dirt, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahaM8720GZ
30,nice place for a stroll.,My wife and I recently moved into the area and decided to visit. Although it was a rather warm day we didn't find the amount of flowers and fauna that we were expecting. I can only assume that this is really a seasonal situation here in order to capture the right flowers and plants that will be in bloom. Overall the grounds are lovely. Bring good sturdy walking shoes water and a hat. Will come back here again when we have some rain,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5856OOdavidg
30,A Good Visit,"Visited in mid August. This is a large park. A number of the sections that are in the front of the park are well cared for like the cactus garden, the rose garden and the fairy tale houses. The fairy tale section is so very nice for young children. While there, the gardens had a fairies & troll theme going on. I walked the entire road/ trail that the tram would take as well as some of the other trails. This part was long. It was a warm day so be sure to bring along some water. I did and was glad since I didn't find any stands along my walk to purchase any & didn't find any water fountains except at the entrance. The map seems to say a tram might be available, but I didn't see any running during my visit. I'd recommend asking at the booth when you buy your ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Virginia2002
50,Amazing bliss here!!,I have passed this place a lot coming down off Palos Verdes Peninsula. We finally made it!! The grounds are amazing and very tranquil. Some friends went to Mother's Day there and had a blast!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
40,Tranquil - and sunny!,"Our most recent visit to South Coast Botanic Garden was in the summer. Much of the garden is without shade, so the sun can be a bit intense. The garden closes at 5pm, I believe, so a later evening visit isn't possible. The garden couldn't be any easier to visit, no lines at the ticket counter and no crowds. It's also very pretty, I would suggest a spring visit if possible. They often host plant sales which can contain fun finds. They sometimes have kid's activities, Fairies v Trolls on our visit. Oh, and the admission fee is extremely reasonable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ojerio
50,Pure freakin' bliss,"My visit to SCBG was a top highlight of my trip to Southern California. Obviously if you love flora you don't need a ton of superlatives to know why a place like this is so wonderful, but the care & artistry on display everywhere was really impressive, & you can tell they take a lot of pride in being a center for learning & community. Thank you so much for a gorgeous day. CR",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clarktown_USA
50,Beautiful!,"A short drive off Crenshaw, parking is free and very easy. You buy your tickets (senior discount $6) and enter in. A tram ride for the one mile loop is available for an extra fee of $5. The map brochure can be a little confusing (and I minored in Geography in college). Flowers and plants are sorted into areas. Don't miss the fragrance garden (but don't accept the tour). Special programs are often presented for the children and weddings happen frequently (watch out for equipment and workers setting up). BTW, the workers were very nice and helped us find a short way to the handicapped parking area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/499renev
50,Impressive!,"We've driven by this hidden gem a number of times and not really noticed it because it has a very unassuming entrance. However, we wanted to go somewhere on Easter that was outdoors and beautiful, and we chose this place. We're so glad we did! It is larger than you would think, and there is quite a bit of walking to see all or most all of it. The most developed and most beautiful areas were the cactuses and the roses, at least that we saw. These gardens were beautifully sited and planted, and there was obviously great care in achieving incredibly beautiful specimens. The plants seemed so healthy and vibrant. Some of the back areas were less cared for, like the orchard and the vegetable garden. It would be nice if some of the back areas had as much attention as the close ones; I was really looking forward to inspiration from those areas, but it was not to be. There are several amazing picnic areas, so if you are in the mood to picnic, you would not be disappointed! There was also a children's area which looked great, but we didn't spend any time there as we had no children with us. Overall, this Botanical Garden is not to be missed as it has been beautifully managed and tended, and we will definitely go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodToGoGirl
40,Great Place for a Relaxing Stroll,"First, it was a Tuesday-Free Day, so that was a surprise bonus. This a very large and delightful garden that is particularly suitable for families with children of all ages. Wide, paved walkways and lots of OK-to-Touch displays. Even in February when most plants were not blooming or even emerged, there were still plenty of things to see. Especially liked the ""senses garden"" filled with aromatic plants and other showy botanicals to see and touch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kumtux
40,Natural and Beautiful,"I have been to many Botanic Gardens in Southern California, and SCBG is the top ones because I'd its size, tranquility, singing birds, rich plants and, flowers for each season.The lake area is still under construction. Wish the lake could be restored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Differences
50,A 2 or 3 hour of relaxation and nature.,"This is a lovely place to spend 2 or 3 hours of enjoyable beauty. The Garden is large, but not huge. There are many types of local botany, with rose gardens and other flowers. There is a small lake where you can picnic. You don't need special clothes or shoes, but comfortable walking shoes will make the visit more enjoyable. If you are visiting the South Bay area of Los Angeles County, this would be a great place to drop by on your way to visit some of the other treasures of the area. This is a great place for a romantic walk for two, or for a family with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelfS7339XG
50,This Garden is NOT in Palos Verdes Estates. It's in Rolling Hills Estates,"Great botanic garden. Fun place to go either alone or with family. It is, by the way, in Rolling Hills Estates NOT Palos Verdes Estates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrimoin
40,Awaken your senses!,"Located on Crenshaw Boulevard in the Palos Verdes Peninsula, the 87-acre South Coast Botanic Garden is a stellar example of how creative land reclamation can produce a natural treasure of amazing beauty - strange but true, these gardens were laid out over a garbage landfill!Apparently, the area where these gardens now stand was once covered by the Pacific Ocean! When the ocean receded, a sediment called diatomite was left behind. Diatomaceous earth has various uses as an insulating or strengthening additive in construction, as also for filtration applications.In the early 1900s surface mining of this area started, which eventually went on to become the more destructive open-pit mining. When mining output declined in the mid-1950s, the mining company sold the diatomaceous earth mine to the County of Los Angeles, which put the site to use as a temporary garbage landfill.The turning point came in 1961, when civic minded citizens headed by Frances Young persuaded the county to use the site for a botanic garden – in effect the South Coast Botanic Garden has traversed the distance from mine to sanitary landfill to garden.After the trash was contoured and covered with three feet of topsoil, the planting of the gardens started with over 40,000 donated plants. The collection has since grown to be in excess of 200,000 plants, representing 2500 different species from locations as far away as southern Africa, the Mediterranean and Australia!The gardens are structured into many areas of interest, each with its own unique appeal. They include the Dahlia Garden, the Mediterranean Garden which also showcases coastal California plants, the Children’s Garden, the Banyan Grove with its massive tangled roots, the Desert Garden that features cacti and other succulents.The Garden for the Senses is very special, encouraging visitors to enjoy flowers and plants by smell, sight, touch etc.,The Fuchsia Garden features fuchsias and other shade-loving plants. The aptly named WaterWise Garden features trees and shrubs that do not require much water.The Rose Garden with over eighty rose varieties is a riot of colour and makes for a fascinating centerpiece. The Display Greenhouse has a range of tropical plants such as Orchids, Crotons, Anthuriums, Begonias and Adeniums.The Japanese Garden/Koi Pond is a particularly restful area – the shrubbery, the relaxing water sounds, the brilliantly coloured koi fish darting in the pond – calm and serene is an understatement.Do make sure to visit the Gift Shop that has a range of interesting items including hand crafted jewellery, though a tad high priced.Pets, alcohol and nicotine products are prohibited within the Gardens.Picnics are permitted in designated areas of the Garden. Even better, so are weddings and other celebrations – a wedding here would be quite a sublime, once in a lifetime event. On a more sober note, memorial services are also allowed in venues such as the Amphitheater and the Koi Pond Patio.The South Coast Botanic Garden is open 9am to 5pm on all days with the sole exception of Christmas Day. Admission charges for adults is $9 per head and for seniors (above 62, so we qualified!) it is $6. Parking is free and extensive.Do give yourself at least half a day if not more to experience this restful urban oasis and awaken your senses!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
40,Very nice garden to visit....in cool weather,"We took our granddaughter to the garden so she could participate in the ""Fairies vs Trolls"" game that is popular during the summer months. There is plenty of parking close to the entrance. Admission prices vary but there are discounts so check the website to see which one might apply to your group.It was an unusually warm day in August and, although we were dressed appropriately, it was a hot visit. Be sure to bring some water with you! The game seemed straightforward but the map supplied isn't to scale and is confusing to follow. This wasn't just us; everyone we encountered during our hunt felt the same. Even the gift shop attendant said the map is lacking in many ways. At any rate, we found many of the Fairy (our chosen team) locations and had plenty of beautiful foliage to observe while walking.There is a tram that operates as well for those that just want to see the highlights of the gardens from the paved paths. We also saw plenty of lizards, insects and interesting plants and trees. Well worth the visit especially if you go on the third Tuesday of each month: free admission!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonestarlizard
40,Wedding and reception 10/6/18,Went there for a wedding for my nephew and and his bride. The place is very well kept from what we saw. The staff was polite and handled the whole affair very well. And kept the standard visitors at a polite distance from the wedding party and held the venue open long after the gardens closed to the public. Congratulations to all for a job well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daviddeselle
50,Wonderful place,We got a deluxe membership from Groupon and we have visited here with the kids many times since then. This is one of our favorite places in the area so far. There is a Tram that operates on weekends that will drop off and pick up around the garden if you are not prone to hiking too far with some decently steep terrain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaacB1037
40,Pretty and different flowers,"It was a good garden to walk. It is big and has enough plants and flowers to keep you busy for a while. When we went they had the trolls vs fairiesWe saw lots of fairies in our walk, it made it over the top fun for my 7yr old. My 13 loved taking pictures and my 11 complained all the way from all the walking. Lol",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sndunga
40,Beautiful place to visit,My sister got married here about 20 years ago so it was fun to see how it had changed. We went on a very hot and sunny day. I would suggest going when it is cooler since it is all quite exposed. Beautiful day and make sure to check out the little gift shop. You can also buy little plants which make great gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wendy_PlettSunTours
50,Natures Beauty Exhibit,"We were visiting Family in Palos Verdes and looking for nature activity. We had passed the Botanic Garden before and investigated their openings and charges. The 3rd Tuesday of the month is Free Admission. There is amble parking. We checked in, made a donation, and picked up map of the gardens. There is a gorgeous rose garden with magnificient rose specimens. There is a smell and touch garden area to explore. There is an outer perimeter trail to walk and view various plants, shrubs, trees, and flowers. Most all of the specimens are labelled and which country they originated. Beleive this was all built on a land fill. You can enjoy beauty, walk the trails, and relax on benches located throughout the garden.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lukeanthonywflorida
50,Fabulous Rose Garden,"I went to an afternoon tea here that was an appreciation event for donors. I was a guest of a friend. The botanical garden property has been here for many many years, however, the rose garden has been totally redone with both hard and soft scape that is beautiful and so welcoming. Although a lot of material was reused in the new design, it’s nothing like it was before. The CEO and other players are developing and presenting new and exciting ways to be involved in the property. They even have two family movie nights in July. The property is large but there is a tram to ride around. The rose garden is right in front and accessible. The gift shop is small but I understand improving with time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsPickle
40,Great walk especially 3rd Tuesday..FREE admission!,"Should walk through the gardens when the flowers are in bloom, its a little gem in South Bay. Will be surprised how much they have improved during the last couple of years and had planted so many different flowers, thanks to all the volunteers. I was a bit sad that the water pond and ducks were gone because of the dry season, but the rest of the garden are well kept. There are so may different species of plants, trees and flowers and the route is well signed. You can spend a couple of hours strolling and learning about the environment with all the children and family. You will not regret especially on 3d Tuesday when it is free for all. Plenty of parking and bathrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
40,Neighborhood Nature,"We had a wonderful time walking around the garden for a few hours, exploring, taking pics and spending time as a couple to stop and smell the flowers.87 acres- dirt and concrete paths easy to walk and lots to see along the way (bring water!). I haven't been to many botanical gardens so don't have a lot to compare to but seems like it is a work in progress and for anyone who does gardening in their own home it is a living, ever-changing space. My guess lack of rain and likely lack of funds has impacted it. Young rose garden but we did get to see some blooming. No lake.I have driven by this place for years and finally decided to see what it was and I am happy we did. If you are a local, make it a must on your to do list. If you are visiting the area and looking for a nature walk not at the beach, it is a good place to come for a few hours if not into anything strenuous or a commitment for the day like hiking in the Santa Monica Mountain etc..As a tourist, I don't think it will blow your mind, but I hope the local community will continue to support as I imagine places like this are treasures we should support and preserve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StacyB121212
40,Nice visit among flowers and trees,"Great to convert the previous garbage landfill to the opposite. Sith over 2500 spices of plants there is always something in Bloom all season long. However, a feeling of just too many has been included in the design which make the garden is a bit unharmonic.But overall it is a nice visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Great for Halloween festivities,"Went with the family to do the garden's haunted treasure hunt. The four year-olds with us had a blast! We went on a warm day, so should have gone early in the morning to really appreciate the garden, but overall, it's a lovely spot for kids and adults.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fewsl
30,A desert garden,"The South Coast Botanic Garden is a large property, however I found the online description of the garden misleading. This is predominantly a cactus and succulents / natives garden. If you are not a lover of drought-loving plants, you can skip this attraction.In particular I went to see the rose garden as the David Austin website states this is a good garden in CA to see English roses. I found the newly-planted rose garden a big disappointment - very small and with only one hybrid of DA rose! Most were standard hybrid teas - nothing worth paying to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S6567YEdavej
30,Scenic stop,While you are in the Palos Verdes area drive a bit inland and explore the South Coast Botanic Garden's 87 acres of plants. Nice place for a stroll among the thousands of plants on display.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
30,casual visit to the garden,"This was my 1st time visiting the Southcoast Botanical Garden because I am a member of the Descanso garden, so I was able to get in at Southcoast garden for free. Southcoast botanical garden is an OK place to visit. It is a pretty big garden from area perspective. The garden is emphasizes on California native plants, however, there are some plants other from other part of the country as well from around the world. However, there are not many family like activities compares to Descanso garden. So, I rate it as 3 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/741mannyt
20,Good to see recent redevelopment projects,"As first time visitors, we enjoyed the planted areas near the entrance gate, and a glimpse of the rose garden beyond the construction barriers. We were disappointed with the overgrown and unkempt conditions prevalent through much of the rest of the grounds we viewed. Visitors should be warned of these conditions prior to entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GyrFalcons

50,"Tranquile gardens for walking, hiking or meditation","Come and visit the newly created Rose Garden!!This 86 acre hidden gem is a place for children to explore at the children's garden, or create arts and crafts at the ""Kids Corner"" events, or take long walks among the shade trees. Adults can see an abundant variety of native plant species in the Mediterranean Garden & Succulents and Cactus in the Cactus garden. Great place to sit and relax or to take a vigorous walk or hike. Perfect for multi-generation families or solo visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smph5
40,Good For an hour or two,"I am guessing this place was established at least 60 or 70 years ago by the size of some of the trees. It is a huge garden but well laid out with roads and sign posts so you should not get lost. Actually it is too much to walk all the way round unless you have a whole day and are pretty fit. Fortunately there is a little tour train in operation at the weekend but I had to walk so could only see a limited area. Most of the exhibit areas including fuschia garden, dahlia garden and vegetable gardens are all close to the entry. It is famous for a desert and cactus garden which is quite large but easy to get to. It is very worthwhile with a lot of major specimens. The Japanese garden is not bad but does not have the absolute precision the Japanese would use. Right now the place is undergoing a huge transformation including an expansion of the desert area, new rose garden and rebuilt lake. This is supposed to be complete now but I would estimate more like mid 2018 before everything is really complete. So not bad for an afternoon of fresh air but can look forward to some good things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRNSydney_Australia
50,Commune with Nature,"i visit the gardens almost every weekend. The flora gardens are ever changing and the staff and volunteers keep it in Top condition. There are special exhibits and displays Frequently. Recently a model train display set up write several train clubs showing their best miniature scenes. The are music concerts on the lawn or in the assembly hall and special education events like the visits of wolves and a lexture on their keystone species status. There are hiking trails trough the woods and I go with friends, family or solo for 3-4 miles of varied trails. Some are slightly technical, all are a great walk",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ononru262

Several areas are under construction so I will need to visit again to enjoy the new gardens.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimcE8895KX
50,Beautiful Cherry Blossom's are in Bloom!!!,"I’ve always wanted to see Cherry Blossom trees in full bloom and was so surprised to find out they were on my way to Newport Beach. We were vacationing in Manhattan Beach and I was looking for things to do when I discovered a ‘Cherry Blossom Festival’ at the South Coast Botanic Gardens. It was on a day when we couldn’t attend so we decided to drive over and check out the trees.Originally the Cherry Blossom trees were gifts from Japan where over 200 species can be found throughout the country. A small number of cities in the USA have received them as gifts from the Japanese government. They are also not easy to catch blooming as they only last one week. Amazingly the South Coast Botanic Gardens has many trees and are they ever gorgeous!We visited on March 6, 2017 when the trees were in full bloom. I must say that I have not seen these beautiful pink flowers anywhere else in the world except Tokyo. They are a beautiful sight to behold.The gardens are easy to find, easy close parking and I also liked their reciprocity program with my local Morton Arboretum of which I am a member. We had free entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahsBackstage
30,Great little place for locals,"Got a yearly membership for our family. We were expecting a lot more flowers and green, but didn't find it here. But this is LA so it makes sense. Huge place.

Located in the beautiful Palos Verde Peninsula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardwK1705JY

We've enjoyed not only the lovely gardens and spectacular trees but also concerts and picnics on the ""upper meadow."" Yesterday, we had great fun with our little granddaughter finding the ten ""hidden"" pumpkins, each of which had a garden-related riddle (difficult enough to engage the grown-ups involved). We stopped in the gift shop for water and a popsicle--delighted with our adventure.

40,A great venue for a wedding,"Just attended a wedding here. It is interesting, pretty in summer and fall, not so much in January when we went to check it out as a venue. Staff very easy to work with- gorgeous in the growing season. Tried to get to get shop, but was too busy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmbfox
50,Grandchildren friendly,This is a great place to spend an afternoon with your children or grandchildren. They can play on large grassy areas or walk-through small trails to you beautiful plants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillB297
30,"Come, relax, sit and enjoy or walk",Easy to get to and spend as little or as much time as you like enjoying the gardens and nature. Nice gift shop plus plants for sale. Enjoy walking the nearby trails as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraAl
40,Good place to relax and hike,Great relaxing place to spend a few hours . We have lived in the area for a long time and always drive past . I'm glad we stopped to enjoy and take it all in. Very clean and wonderful . Price is a little steep but I guess it goes to the upkeep,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
50,Great for Birds and Flowers,"I had been to the South Coast Botanic Garden many years ago to photograph flowers. On a recent trip to Long Beach I had some spare time and wanted to get some bird watching done. Turns out the Botanic Gardens was just as good for bird watching as for photographing flowers. Hummingbirds are as common as honey bees here, Western Blue Birds, Red Tailed Hawks, and many other species. Highly recommended for strolling, birdwatching, or nature some get back to nature time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pipehorse
40,"Nature Transformed: From Open Pit Mine, Then Landfill, to Glorious Gardens","For those who lament the modern assault on Nature and depletion of natural resources, there is a lesson to be learned at South Coast Botanic Garden. Once an open pit mine, in the 1940s, then a massive landfill dump from 1957-65, today this pristine landscape contains some of the most beautiful gardens in all of the Los Angeles area.Today, 50 years after this place became a garden, it is that and so much more. On a regular basis the beautiful landscape hosts events, weddings and even art shows.On the day we visited there was glass art carefully placed around the themed gardens. In one meadow there were Ferraris on display. And in the large hall the Fuchsia Society was holding a plant demonstration and sale.While situated so near one of the nation's largest cities, what is especially surprising about the garden is how quiet and peaceful it is. Roam the 87 acres of rolling grounds and you will be embraced by Nature, Western Bluebirds and Hooded Orioles fill the trees.While not as large as the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia, or The Huntington Botanical Gardens in Arcadia, this garden is easy to reach throughout the LA metropolitan area and is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239ernies
40,Beautiful garden,Because of the drought i could not see some flowers but the desert plants are incredible! Also I love the decoration too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimize940314
40,Beautiful gardens with so many incredible plants,These gardens are gorgeous just to stroll through and look at the plants or if you are a photographer you will jump for joy at all of the photo opportunities. So many different kind of plants that I have never seen after living in Minnesota most of my life.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimbev2015
50,"A very beautiful park, friendly staff, amazing hummingbirds, incredible plants.",Visited this beautiful Botanical Garden and was thrilled to see the diversity of plants. The cacti garden was the most spectacular sight for me since I'm from Canada and haven't seen this many varieties and was amazed to see the hummingbirds feeding off the cacti flowers. It grounds very well kept and so wonderful to walk barefoot on their beautiful lawn by the information centre. The gift shop was lovely and it was peaceful to sit in the courtyard.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilyn111111
50,Japanese Festival & Nature Connects Art with Lego Bricks,"March 5th, 2016 was forecasted with light rain spread spuraticically throughout the day. My family and I still wanted to go, so we went prepared with umbrellas. Before going to the Gardens, we stopped in San Pedro to get delicious breakfast at Rex's cafe. It is a small place, so you are going to get cozy. The fruit bowls are a good size as a side with your meal. I get something different every time I go, this time I got the eggs Benedict, no sauce. My dad likes to get the special drinks, which are okay, some are better than others. Anyways the meals we had were satisfactory and filling; we were ready to walk the gardens. We went to the South Coast Botanic Garden for the Japanese Festivities but it worked out that Sean Kenney's Lego Art was there as well. March 5th, was a partially cloudy and sunny day, with a very light sprinkle during the mid morning and the afternoon. It came in handy we had umbrellas so we could still walk and talk pictures of what was around us. It was a very special day, an educational experience, seeing the different organizations that came out to perform at certain times for the Japanese Cherry Blossom celebration. Overall, don't be afraid of going out on a day that has some rain expected. You will discover things that happens when it rains. And it wasn't raining constantly all day long, the sun shinned, it got warm, the clouds were in and out, and it turned out great. That type of day makes the lighting great for pictures too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeonyRoze
50,Gardens and Legos,"We have been to the gardens before but the reason for this visit was the temporary exhibit of Lego sculptures. There are about 16 displays ranging in size from a life size gardener, lawnmower, and bison, to oversize humming birds, bees, and a rose. We found the Lego koi in the koi pond a fun twist. It was spring so the gardens were especially full and colorful. The exhibit closes May 8, 2016, so hurry.Note, the lake is currently empty for much needed restoration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,An all-year-round place to visit,"Though, as several other reviews have noted, the South Coast Botanic Garden may not be currently looking quite its best due to the prolonged Californian drought, it really does not deserve the criticism of being left unkempt and decayed. Maybe a couple of recent El-Niño-at-last? rainstorms helped, but when we went in early March there were lots of signs of attentive maintenance and renewal of fallow areas, with plenty of events planned both for adults and children. We got there in time for the tail-end of a show by the African Violet Society of America, apparently the world’s largest society devoted to a single plant species: who’d have thought it? Across the Garden’s 87 acres there’s a great variety of plantings and environments, from lush to desert. Particularly attractive when we were there were the Banyan Grove with its undergrowth of colorful Clivias just coming into bloom, and the delightfully imaginative “Garden for the Senses”, where a great array of herbs and other plants deliberately chosen for their olfactory and tactile as well as visual qualities are thoughtfully coded to enable visitors to indulge each sense as appropriate. Labeling in Braille too… now that IS thoughtful. Back in a few weeks for the Rose Garden coming into bloom, and there’s plenty else to keep one returning. The Senior admission of $6 each is a pretty good deal, but the annual Senior Family rate of $55 is certainly worth considering if you’re local to the RPV area and plan to come back as frequently as the Garden deserves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjbrown10
50,"Beautiful tree collections, wear good shoes to enjoy!","An early January visit means that several of the South Coast Botanic Gardens’ collections were not in bloom. Specifically, the fuchsia and dahlias were resting. I understand that this is the way it goes for gardens and was able to find one little fuchsia flower that made me very happy!Just past the Mediteranean Garden the succulents and cactus were a welcoming sight– exactly the kind of thing you come to California to see!The gardens map reads that if you have one hour to visit, “If you have a little more time and can explore further, you might want to walk the tram road. The loop is just under one mile and has some slight inclines; just right for a mild workout. Follow the green stripe on the road. There are many trails that bisect the Garden. You can take a side trip on one of the many trails, just be sure to wear comfortable shoes.” My advice: Do it!If you just stay in the gardens near the Visitor’s Center you won’t find this Buddha’s hand citrus tree in the Rare Fruit Orchard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeriByrum
30,El Nino drought,This garden could have been a beautiful place if not for the drought. Everything was dry. The lake was under renovation but we did not see anyone doing work around it. My pre school grandson commented that the lake turned into a puddle. We went on a Thursday afternoon for the Lego display. The grandkids were excited but it turned out to be a dud. It could have been a great afternoon if not for the place looking like it was abandoned by the gardeners for years. For the price of $9.00 for adults and $4.00 for kids 5 and up not so worth it. We will try again to visit once the drought is over.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
30,"Beautiful, but visit when there's a discount rate","Beautifully laid out with walking paths, signage is helpful, ducks in pond, great photo opps, but expensive for a large family",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LivPurple
50,Great Staff!,"After my daughters summer camp, we excitedly walked and enjoyed the Botanic Gardens. The staff were very nice and let us explore wherever we wanted. We all agreed we loved that the staff weren't following us or watching us walk around. The only places the awesome staff were was either cleaning the bathroom, helping people, watering plants, working in the gift shop, etc. Luckily, there was a gift shop so we could mail one to my dad who enjoys this garden. It was a lovely way to spend our vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Italianfood770
40,Fun place to spend a couple of hours,"I visited South Coast Botanic Gardens today because I wanted to visit during their sweetheart stroll. I didn't see any Valentine's day decorations. Instead I saw booths for free snacks, wine and beer. I did see a grilled cheese food truck. I really would have liked to see the place decorated for Valentine's day. I did have fun even though my main purpose was to celebrate Valentine's day with my husband. Oh well!! I still recommend visiting and staying for a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
40,South Coast Botanical Garden,"This is a hidden gem known mostly to the locals that live in the South Bay. My wife has been a docent there and we are both ""life time"" members. It's a great place to take children to see and learn about plants and flowers. There is a dedicated ""children's garden"" based on nursery rhymes with associated plants and flowers. They have a seasonal flower show and have biannual plant sales where you can purchase both common and unusual plants and flowers for prices much less than nurseries. They have many educational seminars and lectures that are free to the public on specific types of flowers, plants and trees. The area is very large with mostly gravel trails, so wear comfortable shoes. There is a duck and turtle pond in the lower section that is a favorite with young children who often bring bread to feed them. The upper area also can accommodate weddings amongst the flower gardens and they have a reception hall for catering events. The most interesting events are in the summer when they host their Shakespeare Festival where you bring your own dinner and beverages (alcohol allowed), blankets or lawn chairs and watch a Shakespeare play at sunset. Check their website to see what activities are doing on for the month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439kents
40,Lovely way to spend an afternoon,"Hadn't visited these gardens in over 30 years - the trees have grown. Spent a few hours strolling in this wonderful setting. Very nice day. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/110Barbara
20,Drive Through Palos Verdes to Get There Was More Scenic,"It is not my intent to be unkind. I don't know if I was expecting Bellingrath or Butchart Gardens but as someone who enjoys the occasional nature photography excursion I would have been better served to have gone to the local Home Depot garden center. I understand California is in the middle of a drought and my visit was in November, but dead areas abounded and the gardens are overgrown and weedy in many places. The trails, though numerous, were unkempt. There is little excuse for this in a botanical garden. As another reviewer said the lake is under repair and dry. Perhaps November was not the best time to visit. The welcome building and adjacent grounds were first class and enjoyable (except for the weeds which I found very off-putting). Parking is spacious and free. However, on a brighter note, the drive through Palos Verdes getting to the gardens was quite nice and the highlight of the trip. I highly recommend a day trip driving around this spectacular peninsula",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Narykids
30,Good walking trails,"My husband and I came here for the first time this weekend and were disappointed that the lake was drained and under construction (I hadn't read the ""garden updates"" section on the website where it warned of that). The lake was one of the main things we wanted to see. The garden has a multitude of plants, trees and flowers, which are very nice, but much of it appeared dry. It's a nice place to walk around, but I think I personally enjoy the grounds of the LA County Arboretum much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariaBCalifornia
40,Wide variety of very interesting plants on display.,We went on a very hot day in September and were soon wilting in the heat. Sadly some of the plants looked the same! End of the Summer after a drought probably did not present in the best circumstances. This place could be really fantastic in the right circumstances.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
40,A Wide Assortment of Gardens in One,"I was especially attracted to the California Native Plants because they use less water (a major consideration during our drought) and they provide food and habitat for birds, bees, and butterflies. There's also a delightful children's garden that is based on nursery rhymes with plants to match. There's also a dollhouse, a butterfly garden and more. The Japanese Garden has a Koi pond and stone lanterns that are over 200 years old! The Rose Garden is amazing, with over 1,600 roses, including the David Austin English roses. The Desert Garden includes cacti, euphorbia, aloes, and other succulents. There's much more, but this should give you an idea of why you should come. You won't regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Lovely And Peaceful,Enjoyed the gardens. Allow a least five hours to walk and tour all the types of gardens. My favorite was the succulent garden and my husband liked the rose garden. Wear a hat and comfortable walking shoes. Bring water and snacks. The perimeter trail is about 1 mile. A mini vacation for a day. We had a wonderful visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriciaC381
50,a must place to see if you are in the area,"beautiful and peaceful place to visit if you are in the area, later on go to terranea resort or donald trump golf course both have a nice walking path and restaurant to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mardi777
50,A hidden gem!,"This was a lovely botanical garden, a combination of manicured flowered spaces and a rose garden, and wild, natural areas filled with native California plants, including cactus and succulents. There is a small admission fee, and you receive a map which you should look at! We didn't and missed some things such as the Japanese Garden. There are lovely paths and trails, you can get lost in the peace and quiet and beauty of the grounds. There is a picnic area adjacent to the gardens, a nice gift shop and clean restrooms. A must-see when in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertar302
40,The water is off,This garden is casual. You walk around and see plants and vines growing together into beautiful floral arrangements. Wear your hiking shoes. Some of the paths are a bit rugged. A lot of the locals become members to use the paths for exercise. Worth a stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatConwell
40,A Nice Garden!,"This garden offers much to see and experience for adults and/or children. It offers a place to unwind, relax and explore while surrounding yourself with nature. Truly a place to appreciate nature's beauty. There is an admission fee, but parking is free. The staff are also very friendly. Overall, the Botanic Garden is Recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mvillag
40,This place has really been upgraded,"I visited South Coast Botanic Gardens today. They have really upgraded the property. I purchased a deal on Groupon for $35.00 dollars. You get 2 passes for you and a friend to use all year and it gives you 2 free passes for friends to use (1 time only). The rose garden was beautiful and it is a huge property. I would highly recommend for a day of relaxing, exploring or for a good workout. Be sure to take your time as not to miss anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
30,Not the Huntington- but also cheaper!,"Those who gave this place a 5 star are either very easily amused, or settle for what's available in the area. Sorry but this place is Just Ok.The last time I came here was with the girls scouts in the 5th grade, and we had to pull weeds to earn a merit badge. Fast forward 30+ years, and here we are, strolling along the path of flowers and trees on a sunny Sunday afternoon.Its a small, but nice little botanical garden tucked near the hills between Torrance and Palos Verdes. This garden is not as grand as the Huntington LIbrary, but admission is also much cheaper (only $9 versus $23) too. So you do get what you pay for.Unlike the Huntington, there's not much to do, except view various types of floral and fauna, and one can definitely cover the grounds easily in a 2 hours. There's no cafe or private collection of any kind to view. I'm not even sure if you can bring food on the ground, although they have a tiny gift shop, and, I do see trashcans placed sporadically around the grounds.This place supposedly has a tram, but they can't seem to hire a driver, and probably because of budget, only run it after 1:00 on weekends.They offer a cell phone guided tour, but my Verizon phone wasn't picking up much of a signal.This place does offer groupon specials, so that's probably your best bet in coming here. Its a nice place for an outdoor event or wedding. They even have an indoor venue that can hold up to 300+ people.People come here with their kids, but for me, 2 hours was plenty of time for me to view the place. The staff doesn't seem to be overly eager to help. They are polite but pretty much that's it. Aside from one grounds keeper roaming around in his go-cart, I didn't interact with any staff member outside the admissions box office.Overall its an A ok botanical garden where its seen better days, when possibly their sponsors/benefactors did once care about the place. Free parking on site as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
50,Never Fails to Impress!,"OK, I will admit I am a huge nature lover, but that said…this place never fails to impress. I always come away filled with peace and calm and joy and wonder. Altho I live 150 miles away and was visiting relatives nearby, the first time I came I purchased a membership as I knew right away I would be coming back often. When we are in the area I have been known to come multiple times in a single day! Just as in nature, each day (and each time of day for that matter) at the Garden is a little different. The angle of the light, the ambient air temperature, which flowers are blooming, which birds are singing…all flow together to weave a tapestry of pure beauty and delight. One of my most favorite days was a day when it had just rained and nature put on a display of millions of shimmering 'diamonds' in the sunlight shining through the water droplets. A little history -- you may be surprised! This property was a diatomaceous earth mine and later a landfill. All the more astounding when you begin to explore the rich and diverse 55 acres and think about what it used to be and marvel at what it is now. There is truly something for everyone here. They hold a wide variety of classes and programs open to the public with discounts for members. I have seen infants in strollers all the way to elderly here…all thoroughly enjoying themselves amidst this rich panorama of pure, unadulterated nature. There are both paved and unpaved areas to explore. Some are formal, some are informal, some are forested. There is a delightful children's garden, there are both large and small lawn areas, and vast gardens of both cultivated and semi-native botanicals. There is also a somewhat small but nice gift shop and convenient restrooms as well. When I bring my young grandchildren they like to take turns choosing which path we should go on. One day they played for a whole hour and a half in a deeply forested area as I sat near them on the forest floor, all of us so nourished in soul to be in a place of such primeval beauty. Please if you have not been here come -- alone or with friends or family, but do be sure and come. I guarantee you will be back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl93463

30,If you live in the area and want a place to go once a month to hug some trees,"If you’re in the Palos Verdes area and hankering to be outside, or if you live in the area and want a place to go once a month to hug some trees (a pastime I wholeheartedly support), this is a good place to go. However, it isn’t a really well-organized display of discrete types of horticulture. For that, you need to go to the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena – although from the Palos Verdes area it’s at least an hour’s drive to Huntington and costs $23 versus $9 for South Coast. There is the obligatory Japanese garden; a children’s garden; a rose garden; and a cactus garden. The sensory garden was, meh. And then you’re left wandering around looking at trees. There are some interesting tree specimens, and a very good collection of fig trees, but you have to wander around to find things, and there aren’t many areas with theme designs, like discrete ecosystems. And there are not many smaller or showier plants. I didn’t see any plantings that display what grows well in the local environment. In fairness, I think the place has been really badly impacted by the drought: plenty of palms and conifers were looking decidedly worse for the wear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliethefirehorse
40,Mysteries to Explore,"My parents and I went last Monday, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day for the first time to this garden. The price to enter is not bad, $9 per adult, $6 for seniors. For two seniors and one adult that comes out to $21, about $25. If we were to go twice that is about $50 spent, so we got a membership. If you would like to, you can pay for membership and doing so is an easy process. The membership is $50 and the membership allows you to get in free the rest of the year. The membership also allows you to get into other Botanic Gardens. If you do pay for the membership, the process was quick and simple. You get a plastic card that can be scanned, two tickets for other people you would like to bring, and informational papers. One of the papers is about the other places you can get into. The day was sunny but not to warm and every so often there was a cool breeze. The place consist of many acres and maps and signs are provided. There is the option of doing a tram tour. It a beautiful place. Would love to go back and explore some more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeonyRoze

40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"My husband and I (who generally enjoy nature things) enjoyed a lovely morning here. Although it was December and many plants were not in bloom, there was still plenty to see. Love all the plant and tree identification labels. Wide variety of trees!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsB742
40,Modest but quaint little garden in Palos Verdes.,"Our family of three wanted a day out in the fresh air so we sought and found the South Coast Botanic Garden. This is a tiny pearl of a simple, unpretentious garden in the middle of the Palos Verdes peninsula. Highlights: the cacti garden full of wondrous, other-worldly plants and the rose garden with its heavenly scents and minuscule hummingbirds darting about the many-colored blossoms. Read in another review that most of the scenic walk was at the front end of the park and found this to be true. Remember to visit the little shop on the premises. I bought a perfectly constructed tiny basket made from pine needles harvested from the botanic garden as a keepsake. We were delightfully distracted for almost three hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellemm02420
40,"Very Nice Gardens, Lots to See","We went here on a Friday afternoon on the way home from San Diego. The staff was very friendly and we were guided into a beautiful garden. We had a little trouble finding our way around so we got some extra exercise. I thought walking the path was a little boring. In the end, I wish we would have either had more time to explore the center of the park, or took what time we had to only see what was in the front. There was a LOT there. The Rose Garden was huge and in full bloom in November. Wow. There were very nice plants to keep your interest. Loved the garden and would love to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
30,You'll need a week to see it all!,"It was created from a former city waste dump about 20 years ago and cover more than 60 acres (about 25 hectares). The areas closest to the entrance are small compact gardens in a variety of styles - Japanese Garden, 'Touch & Smell' area for visually handicapped, desert garden, rose garden etc. As you move further afield the areas become larger and more naturalised. During the visitors' main season a bus runs a circular tour round the site.The long winding paths can be very tiring for elderly visitors and those with restricted mobility. Be sure to take a bottle of water on hot days! Rest rooms are located near the entrance and at the furthest point from the entrance, in between 'Keep Calm and Hang on!' Seats where one might rest and enjoy the surroundings are few and far between.Signage is very sparse. We made frequent reference to the free guide map to determine where we were and how to get to the next point of interest. Better route markers and a few 'You are Here' information panels would be a great help.Other than the specialised garden area, my impression of the remainder is of long woodland walks with not a lot to create interest. It's impossible to see the whole place in a day, pick a few key areas to enjoy and save the remainder for another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D6144QZstevem
40,Well done gardens,"Small charge for these gardens. We enjoyed all the flowers and different cactuses. Took our time and took lots of pictures. It is a little difficult to find, but, if you enjoy this type of attraction it is a good place to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel200905SL
50,Peaceful Gardens,"I have to say one of the reasons I like this garden is that it's so close to home. I can go every weekend if I want for a few hours. They have beautiful weddings there, events . It's one of my favorite gardens in LA area. FREE parking !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy
40,My future wedding venue?!,"It's beautiful. There's lots to see and very nicely paved trails and signs. When I came here the drought surely did get to this place. I wanted to see the lake but it was completely dried out. I wish admission was free though like at the Fullerton Aboretum, but I understand it costs money to maintain a garden of this magnitude. Since it's not free I'll only be visiting on the third Tuesday of every month where admission is FREE! Great way to just take a stroll and let time fly by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starrysem
40,A little of everything,"A gem in the heart of Palos Verdes. Lots of flowering plants and butterflies. A large variety of specialty gardens: cactus, Japanese, rose, palm, conifer. My favorite was the children's garden with small scale buildings and figures. Plus more wild gardens with rustic paths. Allow several hours to see all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kathy984
40,Beautiful and serene atmosphere,I visited the South Coast Botanical Gardens in April of 2014. Everything was in bloom. I highly recommend this place because it has never been crowded any of the times I have been there. If you have a student ID it's only about 6 dollars to get in. It takes about 2 hours to walk around and see everything. You can also bring a picnic lunch and stop at one of the benches throughout the area and have lunch. There is a koi pond which is nice to sit and look at. It's very relaxing. There are plenty of portable restrooms throughout and a main restroom at the start of the trail. There is also a gift shop where you can but trinkets and snacks if needed. I would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
50,Beautiful Garden,"We have gone half a dozen times because we are members to a reciprocating garden. We have gone during different seasons, and on our last trip, we walked twice on the tram route (totalling 2 miles). The kids love the children's garden and the numerous koi ponds. The rose garden is huge and beautiful. It is a hidden treasure in Los Angeles. Finally, if you want to join a garden for its reciprocity benefit, this one is the least expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/formosangirl

What a great place!Manageable, fun paths to walk on, small and intimate gardens that are a great display of native habitat and plants. Totally exceeded what i expected and had a great time. didn't even get to see everything so i'll definitely be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frankc575
40,A Walk Through the Gardens,"This was my second visit, but first in a long time. The gardens are large and we only had a little over an hour, so didn't get past the ""Lake"" (more like a pond). Near the entry is a fairy tale garden which my niece enjoyed and a little beyond that, a cactus garden. The garden seems mostly native plants with some imported. Parts are more manicured and parts are less manicured and the terrain is rolling, but flatter near the entry. My brother-in-law says the trails continued farther beyond the area that we wandered through.This part of California can be hot, but since the gardens are at the base of the Peninsula, the nearby ocean cools it a little. Maybe the next time we will wander beyond the Lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
10,Disappointing.,"Horribly disappointed. It says it is a garden, I expected to see groomed, maintained areas. Only the rose garden and a few of the garden areas when you first enter seem to be maintained. It is still spring yet not many flowers in bloom. Gardens are sloppy and need to be weeded. Hardly any of the plants are marked with their names. Most of the area is an unkept wilderness like area, which is fine but not what it is billed as. The map is difficult to follow. The lake...swamp, is just that. You cannot see most of it becuase of the reeds, and what you can see is just mud. I would not go again, I can see all this for free with a drive to the mountains or a walk around the neighborhood to see more flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petiedogtravels
50,Wonderful respite from LA,"Every part of the LA Arboretum system is excellent. We (SF Bay Area folks who go to LA yearly) have been to all of the other parts of the system but had never made it to Palos Verdes before. It may seem a bit far considering LA traffic for many folks including natives.This is definitely a worthwhile spot. Remarkably quiet and I suspect underused. Huge swaths of gorgeous trees and plants. Some areas better cared for than others but in this period of serious budget issues for everyone, I would judge that the South Coast Botanic Garden is in better shape than many arboreta around the country (we belong to many and visit many more).We were not able to get around the whole garden and so missed quite a few specific collections.Plant labelling is just about non-existent and that's the only deficiency that I would note.Plenty of free parking. There is an admission charge.[Tho I respond to the length of visit question w/2-3 hours, in fact any length of visit is worthwhile.]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nurealam
50,"Beautiful Gardens, peaceful retreat for a day...","The South Coast Botanic Garden is a wonderful day trip, my husband and I are ready to go back again because we only got part way around in half a day. The rose garden is our very favorite, the children's gardens would be great for families with children and the have special events!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robincolo
40,Impressive,Not far of Pacific Coast Highway lies an impressive array of wonderfully landscaped scenery. Built on a dump site that today is the foundation of many trails. Every plant is marked with info as to type and origin. Spend an hour or a few it's a treat.The entire area covers over 80 acres - a real treat to get away from it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rootsap
40,Serene and beautiful,"Beautiful gardens, very well maintained. Great place to take photos and meander. Not really a mids attraction. We were there in mid- May and it was hot. I would recommend going maybe October to April.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sporterw
50,"Really lovely park, great staff","They have an extensive Children's garden and many family-related activities, in addition to really large areas of gorgeous plantings. (The rose garden, for instance, was in full bloom and very impressive.) They have a good website - check it out before you go to make the most of a visit. Plenty of easy parking the day we went - even though it was also the day of a special event (see below). The gift shop is small, but quite nice - with unusual, quality items. The park itself is quite large. They runs a few tours, check their website. The tram runs very infrequently and you should double-check the website ON THE DAY you are going, to avoid disappointment. (Evidently the tram is run by the locals, the park is run by a foundation - which has no jurisdiction over the tram operation?) We are going back soon and will be taking our visitors whenever possible. Annual Plant Sale (April): We just moved to the area and our first visit coincided with this event. It was well-attended, but not crowded (at l east around 10:30 am, although the checkout line seemed a bit long.) It was a large, but very friendly sale - the people who actually grew the plants were at each booth, to give you all kinds of info/help. The prices seemed very good and I assume the Garden got some portion of the proceeds? I also appreciated that they emphasized good looking drought-tolerant natives and especially those that attract wildlife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVShores
40,Beautiful place in the city,My husband and I visited the South Coast Botanical Gardens today. This is a beautiful place to visit. As soon as you enter there is a koi pond that you can sit next to and relax. We walked the entire gardens in a little over 2 hours. There is a man made lake with ducks as well as a rose garden with a large variety of roses. There is even a play area for kids. The cactus garden is pretty large. Admission is only $6.00 dollars for students and $8.00 dollars for adults. I would highly recommend this place if you want to spend a few hours with nature. This place was not crowded at all which made it even better. I have been to the Huntington library and this place is a much smaller version of that but well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sungal43
30,Nice Oasis for a Day Trip,"The often-overlooked South Coast Botanic Garden contains more than 150,000 trees and plants in its 87 acres, making it a worthy day trip for those who enjoy visits to the better-known Descanso Gardens and Huntington Library. Just to stroll the grounds, doing little more than gazing at the scenery, is incredibly therapeutic. Of course, there are rewarding directed activities as well: Gardening, birding and drawing classes are offered along with concerts, plant sales and lectures. You could do worse things to your psyche with the $8 admission cost than walking peacefully among the flowers at this ""jewel of the peninsula.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler
20,"Yes, it's definitely on a landfill","This garden has so much potential, but it felt like the gardeners were either on strike, or absent altogether! It seems to be very untidy everwhere you go and there is the constant reminder that you're walking in a converted landfil. It could be that they went for the rustic nature look, or the fact that I went in the ""depths of winter"" but I still believe that the place could benefit with a lot of thought put into making it seem more tidy. Instead, grasses are left to overgrow, one seat had a plant growing through it, and some of the pathways badly need maintaining, especially in the ""Grasses"" section. One highlight was the ""Garden of Senses"" where a lot of thought had been put into the presentation and information. If only the rest of the garden was the same. The pond was muddy-dirty and full of large pampas-like grassses, which obscured most of it. Shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKertland
50,Beautiful flowers and plants are everywhere!,"I recently did a daytrip out to the Botanical Gardens with my 18 year old nephew and we had a great time. Our goal on this day was to take some nice pictures as we both have Canon Rebels and are working on our photography skills. This was the perfect place as beautiful flowers, plants, and trees were everywhere. We went on a Free day (every third Tuesday of the month) and went camera crazy. There are several specialty gardens: rose, sense, japanese, etc. In all, there are 86 acres to browse through so have good walking shoes, sunscreen, and water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
30,The roses here are glorious.,"Go the right time of year, not Christmas. The entry garden is really wonderful. The cactuses are wonderful. The roses are amazing. This place is built over a landfill, which is interesting. It's a great place to bring children. It was $20 for four people. Bring something to feed the ducks, if you have children. It has a children's garden, which is cute. It's not a huge place, but little kids can get tired running around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaT_10
