40,Urban Oasis,UCLA is an urban oasis located in the Westwood area of LA because it has wonderfully landscaped green campus. The dogwood was blooming when we visited in mid-February. There's also a large botanical garden on campus that we're saving for our next LA trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalGypsy_13
50,UCLA has a beautiful campus,The campus and buildings are old school and have remarkable architecture. The campus is worth the walk around. There are lots of notable places to visit and see what is on TV. I would recommend a trip to walk around Westwood which is the small town adjoined to UCLA campus. Parking is a bit steep in the area. I park in structure 8 for $12 per day and it has lots of public spaces on deck 3 next to UCLA Medical Center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3854JXmikes
50,A fun place to go to school and visit.,"This is a great school and a fun place to visit weather you are a student here or not.

In Romanesque Revival form it was also inspired by an Italian Basilica. It is named in honour of the university librarian with a tenure of 17 years from 1944.Marvellous modern sculptures are to be admired in the Franklin D. Murphy Sculpture Garden. An outstanding collection. A number of interesting temporary exhibitions were underway at the Fowler Museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Westwood Wizardry,"It's an unassuming border to the main campus, but Westwood if chock full of wonderful shops, restaurants, and coffee stops in the shadow of a big city urban scape. As you traverse the streets and pathways of Westwood, you start to discover a beautiful campus setting with all the trappings of a ""Southern California"" environment. Student pedestrian and cycling traffic reflect the academic dedication that is required for success on this campus. The diversions of play spaces, grassy quadrants, party establishments and suburban style entertainment options color the campus with a unique blend of academia, suburbia, and college frivolity. Once you've walked a mile through the streets and college spaces that characterize Westwood, you may find yourself chanting the iconic: ""U -- C -- L -- A -- UCLA fight, fight fight"" (or ""enjoy, enjoy, enjoy"")",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ideamanmsk

Our other daughter can't walk long distances, so she was in a wheelchair. The tour guides were extremely accommodating throughout, making sure that we knew how to exit the auditorium and guiding us toward routes that avoided stairs. This was not an easy task because the campus is large and fairly hilly.The admissions presentation and tour were extremely informative. You just need to register in advance on the admissions website. We visited in July, so parking was easy. I am sure parking is normally a nightmare, but it was easy for us. I downloaded a parking app because the credit card kiosk was not functioning.The campus is beautiful and extremely well-maintained.

The area has a ton of traffic and parking is nearly impossible to find in surrounding neighborhoods. L.A.

50,Self-Guide Tour of UCLA and Westwood,"We checked into the Royal Palace Westwood on a Thursday evening, after a Lyft ride from Disneyland, and we spent Friday walking around the UCLA Campus and Westwood. We checked out on Saturday morning and took a short ride to LAX via Lyft. The hotel was a great value and included a modest buffet breakfast; the WiFi cut out a few times so I used my own hotspot. Our room was light and airy thanks to a sliding glass door onto a balcony overlooking a quiet side-street. The room was quiet with the door shut and on Friday morning we slept late, the day before at Disney having been a long one. At UCLA, we were surprised and disappointed to find the Botanical Gardens closed for maintenance work. As we made our way to the Sculpture Garden, we stopped in at the Charles Young Research Library and had a coffee. Back out in the Sculpture Garden we asked a kindly gentleman the way to the Fowler Museum and, very generous with his time, he took us to it. It developed that he was a UCLA grad and he worked in Admissions there. His kindliness made a huge impression of UCLA on us. The Fowler is worth a long visit; ours was a bit too short as we needed to get to the Ackerman Union for lunch at Wolfgang Puck Express. The rest of the day was spent in Westwood, including window shopping, and some trying a few things on and visiting the Hammer Museum. For the evening, the Geffen Playhouse was sold out, the Fox theater was showing a movie we had already seen, but we managed to get the last 3 seats at the iPic for a new film, and it was well worth it and a unique experience. Afterward we walked around looking at our options for dinner, which were several, and settled on the Napa Valley Grille. The fare was great. The bartender mixed up some drinks and they ended up scratching them from the tab, without a peep from us. This was a fun day. On our next visit we will aim to schedule an organized tour as there is clearly a lot more to see and do here, including the libraries, student facilities, and architecture of the original campus buildings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidW12935

50,Take a walk and discover this place,"Those who think a quick drive around the perimeter of the UCLA campus is sufficient are deluding themselves. One has to get onto the grounds to discover some amazing things, and you don't have to be on faculty or a student to do that. There's the Mathias Botanical Garden to wander around, the Fowler Museum to visit (free admission, see separate review), the Murphy Sculpture Garden is world class. I've probably walked this campus during business trips to the area more than a dozen times, but I always seem to see something new each visit. And the center of Westwood is directly adjacent, with restaurants and some shopping for those who want that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SR260

Very much appreciated the opportunity to visit UCLA and have the experience we did, sensational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevenCav
40,One of LA's Good Walking Spots,"UCLA and the surrounding area of Westwood Village is good for walking and dining, or just sitting outdoors enjoying coffee and people-watching. The campus itself is very spread out, and covers a lot of area. I'd suggest walking in from Westwood Village entrance at LeConte and Westwood Blvd. Visiting the main buildings that probably look familiar from films, would be Royce Hall, a tall brick building with two ""towers"" on each side of the entrance. There's the Arthur Ashe tennis center, and Pauley Pavilion, home of the Nell and John Wooden basketball court, named for the legendary basketball coach and author, and his wifeThere are a number of interesting fountains on campus, when they are running, which could depend on the time of year. (They are operated by recycling the water.)In ""The Village"", area is full of first-run film theaters that have been there for years, possibly a few since the 1930s. If there's a ""premiere"" of a film going on, be mindful that traffic by the theaters could be totally snarled.For a quick made-to-order California ""classic"", visit the large In-n-Out Burger on the corner of LeConte and Gayley. Their shakes, although very rich, are ""legendary"" if you ask anyone, but I know I couldn't eat a burger and fries AND a shake. Skip the fries, and pig-out!There is a major drawback to Westwood Village, and that is the parking situation. The LAPD had been cracking-down on ""phony"" valet parking signs in front of many of the spots on the street. That said, with a little patience, you can find a street spot, but be careful to see how long parking is permitted, as they will ticket you! For peace of mind, I'd say spring for a spot in a car park, as they're many around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lab-girl666

Even got to walk on to the soccer fields!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lajgf
50,The Bastion of Education in Los Angeles,"I went to college here, I loved it, did not want to leave. The campus is expansive, well endowed.

Their catalog is accessible on line with no restrictions provided you enter the right way.

50,One of America's Great Universities,"Nestled in the foothills of Westwood, this is well worth a visit. As you walk through the campus you'll discover that four great buildings form the heart of this school -- and look like a European or Eastern University. Royce Hall is the building of the classics and demands a visit. Then go to the Wooden Center and see the trophies of the first University to achieve 100 national championships.

50,Great tour; wear your walking shoes!,"My daughter and I toured the campus as my daughter is a prospective student. If you or your child are considering applying to the school, I highly recommend the guided campus and housing tours. The walking tour is over two hours long, so wear your comfortable shoes; you will be on somewhat hilly terrain with many stairs both inside and out. The guides maintain a brisk but reasonable pace so you can likely keep up even if you are an older adult. The housing tour is excellent too. You will see two dorm rooms and get a lot of good information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwillard

50,One of the finest universities in the world.,"Not only is this one of the finest universities in the world, it is gorgeous. Take a leisurely walk on any day and find beautiful vistas and botanical specimens. Everything on the campus has been carefully planned and thought out. It is especially beautiful in the Spring when the jacarandas bloom. Be sure to stop by the Powell Library and see the ceiling of the main hall. After the earthquake, the dropped ceiling was removed to reveal a beautiful spectacle of printers marks painted on the beams. It has all been restored and is a sight to behold.Visit the great athletic area, walk down Janss steps to Fowler Museum and on to Ackerman Union for souvenirs and a bit to eat in the food court on the second level.

The admissions officer who presented the half hour informational admissions session was terrible. She had to read through her presentation material and many times, she couldn't even properly read them. And when asked simple questions, she couldn't answer them (e.g., how many undergrad students?) and told us to check the school website instead. What was the point of her being there?.......But the student tour guide was at least competent. She provided lovely anecdotes to go with the tour. Made my prospective student to want to attend this school!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luxetrip

The surrounding area is much nicer with some museums and Bel Air is north of the campus and Beverely Hills is around the corner. Parking is a pain. Best to just drive around it or through it to see what one can see from the car. Maybe if you wanted to buy things that had UCLA on it, then you could go to the bookstore to get those items. Or perhaps you can take a course there, but they also have on-line courses. USC is easier to park and walk through, although you would do it in just a few minutes.

40,"UCLA is knowledge on the foothills,","Once a parent, always a parent, and it was my pleasure to help my daughter relocated from AustinTX-USA to Culver CityCA-USA; she had been accepted to grad school at UCLA. The transition went smoothly, especially since her significant other was able to direct us to secure parking--3 meters wide. We were also fortunate in that he had been here for a few months, procuring their apartment while he continued his career. They are both digital natives, which was extremely important as yours truly is quite behind the times--give me a hard-copy map anytime. But, I was there only to help and enjoy quality time with them, so she used her smart phone to google map our route to pedal to the renowned UCLA campus. But it wasn't so simple; we first needed to go to a UPS station on Jefferson Boulevard for notarized documents, then make our way to the campus and building where she'll thrive for the next two years. Initially, her google map was fine, routing us along lightly trafficked roads and a non-motorized trail. However, once our direction was toward the campus, not only was extremely heavily motorized Westwood the primary road, but the terrain had gone from the relatively flat of Culver City-Venice into the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains. Despite my over 40 years/100,000miles/160,000kms bicycling experience, I was somewhat disturbed that google maps would recommend this route (not the first time I've been disappointed with it), and spent much time pedaling in the lane and using my whistle extensively. Fortunately, this congested road did have bike route signs, sharrows and motor vehicle operators who are aware of non-motor vehicle operators. (California, particularly the Knickerbikers of San Diego County, was a dynamic leader of alternative vehicle use--bicycles--when I was homeported at 32nd Street Naval Station in the late '70s.) We finally arrived on the UCLA campus, turning and twisting on roads through it, stopping at the school of public health.I asked that we take a different route back to Culver City, which google maps showed--and still took us the wrong way. So we used our gut instinct, which was primarily downhill--very nice! I did notice that this was a bike-friendly campus, with roads shared between all traffic: motor, pedestrian, bicycle, skaters. And, of course, it is a beautiful, architecturally significant buildings, lots of green spaces, and very student friendly. I'll give it my ""Wheel of Approval""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Juanito_Hayburg

Especially with all the buzz about Sophina De Jesus, it was amazing to see how talented these gymnasts are. We were very fortunate to get pictures with Sophina and Jordan Weiber!! Tickets were discounted to $6 with AAA membership card.Women's basketball game was fun as well. We attend a lot of basketball games, so I think the gymnastics meet seemed a little more entertaining. They did bingo & a lot of audience camera time. Got to sit in the student section with our daughter though we paid for floor tickets. I must mention, floor tickets are not the floor tickets we were expecting. They were directly across from the general seating?? The customer service reps working the ticket sales were poorly trained for both events. Literally every question I asked, the reps had to turn to ask their supervisor. I was not offered AAA discount either days, I just happen to overhear another rep ask her guest. When I spoke to a supervisor about our 'floor' tickets being the same as general & not 'on the floor' he just apologized for the misunderstanding.DeNeve brunch ($10.25pp) was amazing. Omelet station, burgers, fries, tator tots, huge salad bar, deserts galore, just to name a few of our faves.. Not our first UCLA dining hall visit, and certainly not our last.UCLA campus is great.

20,Overpriced dorm room and variable service,"Arrived as a foreign delegate for conference. Finding the Courtside Collection is tricky for taxi drivers - it is not signposted inside the parking garage, so the driver didn't know where to drop me off. Neither did the parking attendants. Reception staff are students who aren't always knowledgeable or service trained. Four fab exceptions..Jenelle. Theodore and two Hispanic chaps. I wasn't offered help with a massive suitcase. I had to ask and was questioned why I brought such a huge suitcase. Way to welcome a guest! No one on reception knew where to hail buses from either. Pathetic.. My phone charger broke and no one had spare international/USB adapters on reception/knew where to buy one. One chap let me borrow his. We figured out chargers could be bought metres away at the university shop. Three days later. I don't understand whether the staff know how to look after a conference guest at all. I missed breakfast the first day as it finished v.early on a Sunday. Who seriously eats breakfast 7-9am on a weekend? Having said that, the breakfast was exceptional. For kings and queens. So much choice and v.tasty too :) The tech centre is full of protocol driven nobodies who won't let guests use chairs, even if their work takes longer than a few minutes. I had to beg their manager to use a chair. He let me. The campus is poorly lit and hard to find in the dark. If you get lost, go to Ucla medical centre and they will drive you home.

50,Thoughts and Tips from an Alumnus!,"Can't believe I am writing a review about my alma mater! Went here during Vietnam War, so not only got a graduate education but a life education! Don't know why they say it is on Sunset, because most of us students came onto the campus from the other side, past Pauly Pavilion (guess it is now Wooden Center, and for good reason, but - sorry - I still call it Pauly out of habit) and the Commons. The walk from Reagan Hospital past Pauly Pavilion, the student Services Building (we called it the Commons), and up the Janss Steps to the Dickson Court is the quintessential UCLA you see on TV and in the movies. Atop the steps you see the Undergrad Powell Library on your right, and Royce Hall on your left. From this iconic walk you then need to specialise, and for that you need a good map. Very hard to find a decent map of the entire main campus online! Where you go depends upon where you attended, or where you want to attend. And while you are at it, research where to park as well. Parking for visitors is not a significant problem, but to avoid a long walk from your parking space to your intended destination, you need to check things out carefully. Now, back to The top of Janss steps with the library on your right and Royce on your left. Before going deeper into campus, turn around and take in the view, with Pauly below, Wilson Plaza, Drake Field, and the housing blocks just beyond. Nice vista! Ok, now turn around again. Here is the overall layout - in general arts and humanities to your left, sciences to your right, administration straight ahead. For me and my memories, the direction is all to the left, up to Bunche Hall, where I attended classes in my professors' offices and in small seminar rooms - once meeting Governor Pat Brown (yes, Jerry's Dad) in an elevator .(shook my hand and said Hi-hawahyah as if it was one word!). And what we called the GRE next door - the Graduate Research Library, now called the Charles Young Research Library (very fancy indeed). Fine memories of daydreaming out of the windows of Bunche Hall during classes and out from my own 'private desk' at the back of the GRE overlooking the sculpture garden. Lunches with friends near Campbell Hall. Very peaceful, unlike the protests taking place all over the campus with police everywhere and helicopters flying overhead! I persevered, and learned! My Graduate advisor is passed away, and I am now 68! Another world, a past world, a fondly remembered world! It all goes by so quickly my young readers. This is a wonderful campus, and a wonderful experience. And don't forget all the shopping and restaurants lying in wait for you just beyond the south end of campus - in Westwood! Grasp iyour own UCLA experience with all your might! Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden

50,Great University,"I've studied at UCLA, USC, Harvard, and the Sorbonne, and visited many more schools. UCLA beats them all hands down in terms of campus, location, and, in many respects, opportunity. No wonder that more people apply to UCLA than any other school in the U.S. Prospective students: some reviewers make reference to the size of UCLA as if that is a problem. People who complain about being ""lost"" at UCLA would feel the same way at any big school and no doubt in the real world too. There are way too many things to do at a big school like this to succumb to the ""loneliness"" excuse. As for any school, applicants should think about what they want to major in and look at schools that have departments which are strong in that discipline. Visitors: stick to the original campus--the rest is attractive but mainly functional.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UCLA72

50,UCLA campus tour for prospective students,"We signed up for the UCLA campus tour for prospective students (2 hours) and had a very entertaining and knowledgeable guide (Thanks, Matthew!). We walked the campus on our own a couple of years ago but the tour was much more informative (especially for prospective students) as there was also information about the history of UCLA, students services, student safety, clubs & organizations, campus life from a student perspective, and insights about some of the different classes that are offered to fulfill general education requirements. UCLA is a beautiful campus and although they have a lot a students, the campus did not seem overwhelmingly large. UCLA also offers housing tours, but unfortunately the tour was not availabe the day we went. And although we purchased all day parking, (instead of the 2 hour parking option) we inadvertently parked in a spot that we weren't supposed to (parked on the wrong floor) and was awarded a $58 ticket. All ends well though, we dropped by the department of parking office on our way out and filled out a claim ticket (as recommended by the parking lot attendant). Apparently many of the claims are approved. Note: if you are going on the campus tour, definitely purchase the all day parking since you will have to leave the tour early if you only purchase the 2 hour parking....especially if you would also like to have to time to eat/snack on campus or visit the student store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMT1311

10,My nightmare type of Uni,"At first, I thought going to UC Los Angeles is such a PRESTIGIOUS thing in my life! Nevertheless, the dream is far from the truth. Some of the staff here particularly those in the financial department are not at all helpful; all they care about is themselves, NOT the students. Counselors are quite demanding too, it's as if they are the boss and you are not. All I can say that are good are the Royce Hall and Powell Library. Other than that, this uni as the 25th best uni in the world is REALLY NOT the best at all. Cambridge, MIT, Oxford, and QMUL are a LOT BETTER.

40,A large island of calm,"Most university campuses strike me as interesting places to wander. Students playing games or sitting under a tree contemplating, an environment somehow quite different from the cities that often surround them. UCLA is one of the better ones. Maybe because it's so big, so that when you're on campus, busy Los Angeles seems far away.Well, in a way, it is. This is a huge campus. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, you probably won't want to walk it all. And while parking is often free or cheap on weekends, especially Sundays, at most universities, you won't get a break here. Forget about the surrounding residential streets - permit parking only. However, there is cheap meter parking along parts of the streets that form the boundary.Be sure to visit the Mathias botanical garden, maybe the Fowler museum and the sculpture garden.

Shopping, eating, entertainment, movies etc. Fun, youthful, beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aprilg463

50,The Perfect Setting for a College,"the campus at UCLA is a wonderful place to walk around, 365 days a year. The buildings are spectacular, the campus environment is infectious. What a great place to go to college",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BNW-SoCal
30,Your usual college campus,"There are some sculptures, some grassy areas and a small museum. The student store is well stocked and there are several food options. However, it is a college campus set up for college students so lacks the allure of some other destinations in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellen0417
30,Enjoy the sense of academic there,The campus is good but maybe I have been traveling to lots of places and lots of university campuses. I am not feeling excited and there seems not too big differences compared to the campus of the other universities. I did not find a sign with the words UCLA after asking for some students. Not sure if there is something like that finally.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/391shuaiw
50,UCLA,"Everyone has a dream school. For some this is it. If you have kids 12-16 bring them here to an event (sports or art) or just wander around the campus on a sunny day. It may inspire them to work harder in school to get the 4.0 grade average that they say it takes to get admitted here.For an event, check out the events at Royce Hall or try some lesser watched sports like water polo, women's swimming, volleyball or track and field. (Check the UCLA Sports game schedules on line). You could also watch a basketball game in the place where John Wooden, the greatest coach in the history of basketball coached.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldgraham

I took my wife to show her around this beautiful campus....if you like architecture, you will love it! (Lots of architectural designs). If you like nature, you will love it! (Botanical Gardens are located in the south-east). If you like art, you will love it! (Sculpture Garden is located in the north-east). If you like hollywood showbiz-related places, you will love it! (Hundreds of TV shows, movies and commercials have been shot here). If you like sports, you will love it!

There is something for everyone at UCLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foghesino

40,academia in the big city,"A relatively lovely campus in the middle of a big metropolis with a sculpture garden, rolling lawns, some beautiful architecture, wonderful cultural and athletic venues and lively young people everywhere. This is not one of the most beautiful campuses in the states (which include Princeton, Cornell, Yale, U of Virginia etc), or even this state (check out UC Santa Cruz for locale in the redwoods by the ocean and UCSD for location, or UC Berkley for the architecture, USD and USF for views, Stanford for campus).

50,UCLA - A Good University,"I have visited UCLA a number of times. When I was in high school, our high school honors group took a tour of the campus. My sister also went to UCLA and was in a sorority there; we used to drive from our home town to UCLA several times a year to take her to school and back. As such, I got to know UCLA early on. We also have attended graduation ceremonies at the campus.its a leading university; the one thing I do not like is that the football team does not play at the UCLA campus but way across town in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl. Shuttle buses do take students back and forth so they can go to the game.Its a good university and interesting to visit. The surrounding community around the campus is fun to go to.We recently visited again on our trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini

Upon entry, be sure to get a map to guide you to the various buildings and points of interest because not only is the campus beautiful, it is large and expansive, but well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mstb_13
50,Full of life!,"I was recently working on campus during move-ins and the campus is full of life. Maybe because everyone was excited to start the new school year, lol. The students were very helpful! There was a lot of traffic in and out, but that's expected during that time. The setting of the campus is very nice with an easy layout.

Located in the suburb of Westwood with Sunset Boulevard on the northern boundary it is an open a spacious campus full of trees and promenades. There are hidden gems, like the botanic garden on the South Eastern corner, the Hall of Fame is worth a visit and the shop is amazing. UCLA is one of the top academic places in the USA if not the world, so if that is your interest there is much to explore in Medicine, Engineering, Humanities etc. I was lucky enough to attend a Graduation Ceremony at the Pauley Pavilion, what a celebration of youth and enthusiasm that was.There is plenty of parking on the campus and there is a helpful guide booth to give you assistance, even if you are in your car - such is life in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forestaus

40,"Just beautiful, a wonderful walk!","Back when the earth was still cooling and the dinosaurs were walking the earth I actually attended UCLA. Wow, how things have changed! Somebody dumped a ton of the student's money into massively upgrading the campus. It's really gorgeous. If you are in the area it's worth stopping buy and just walking around campus. Look for the main quad and just wander. You can save money if you buy parking by the hour rather than getting an all day permit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evertg
50,The most beautiful campus and an elite education,"I great place to visit for someone who is fascinated by academia. A stroll around the academic departments is thrilling. The campus is also a beautiful oasis in the middle of the LA freeways. Don't miss the UCLA recreation centre for a dip in the pools.I got my degree here. Tough tough tough. Students sleeping in the library to save time. Serious academic quality and ruthlessly demanding. I wouldn't have survived if it hadn't been for the beautiful campus, warm weather and eternal sunshine.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPvCDMc3egg",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B6731YGmariab

50,Excellent Medical Care,"Staff at UCLA is above and beyond ANY other hospital we have ever been to (and we have seen more than our share). They have a uniqueness where they strongly incorporate family in every decision they make. They're extremely thorough, precise, quick & open communication. They always have a smooth process in the way they do things no matter what area/department/service you are getting care through. I trust the care and decisions 100% that our Doctors make at UCLA. They have time and time again gone above and beyond what any other hospital has ever done. Because of them, they have saved my son's life. For us, it's most certainly worth the long distance travel for medical care.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoseVandenbergAFB

50,"UCLA, One of Two L.A. Campuses Worth A Visit","I will begin by admitting that I am biased, I am a Bruin. If one has the time there are two campuses worth visiting in Los Angeles, UCLA and USC. By far the most beautiful, architecturally, is UCLA. There has been a cross-town rivalry that began way before I was born (I'm 68) and I suspect this rivalry will exist way past my time on this earth.Royce Hall is the architectural centerpiece of UCLA and serves as a concert hall as well as other functions. I have attended jazz concerts by John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Kenny Burrell here. Other significant places on the campus include Pauley Pavilion built by John Wooden after UCLA had won its first two NCAA Basketball Championships and Bunche Hall named after Ralph Bunche who negotiated the treaty that helped to establish Israel,I attended UCLA during the early 60's when Westwood was pretty much dead after 6:00 p.m., so much so that Sears had to move out. Then, Westwood had only two movie theatres. Today, Westwood is bustling, all hours of the day and evening with crowds who come to visit multitudes of restaurants and movie theaters.Notable Bruins include Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball (for the Dodgers); Ralph Bunche, U.S. Dept. of State whose accomplishment is already noted; John Wooden who won more NCAA Basketball Championships than any coach in history whose first team went 30-0 with the tallest player being 6'-5""; Walt Hazzard who led Wooden's first Championship team, started ""The Wooden Dynasty"" and later became UCLA's Coach; Arthur Ashe who rose to the top of the Tennis World and sponsored several humanitarian efforts; and Mayor Tom Bradley who became the first African American Mayor of Los Angeles.UCLA's history in Los Angeles and the world is rich and so is, I must admit, is that of USC which is an older institution. Again, both institutions are worth a visit if you are in Los Angeles. But, in my opinion, UCLA's campus is the more noteworthy, today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgmeigs
30,Westwood Village Farmer's Market,"We made a brief stop off the hwy and ended up in Westwood Village, UCLA area. It was a fun area with many eateries, stores and best of all, we found a small farmer's market!

50,Beautiful Campus Great Amphitheatre,"They have a beautiful campus, wonderful teaching staff, but they have an awesome amphitheatre. They give excellent concerts and wonderful plays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YolandaM_12
50,Tip for the less mobile,"A great place to visit, and the campus itself is quite flat and easy to get around.But the less mobile should be careful if they approach the campus from the west side (near Pauly Pavilion and the student store). You have to climb quite a hill.Better to enter from the east side, where the approach will be quite flat. Or, if you do enter via the student store, use the lifts to get up to the top floor. More lifts in the building behind will take you up to the main campus level.Too beautiful and interesting to miss. Don't let the huge slope (Bruin Walk) or the massive Janss Steps on the west side put you off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shizzer
