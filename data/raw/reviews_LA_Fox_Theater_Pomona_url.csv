50,Excellent venue!,"We flew down from Sacramento to see Iya Terra and Rebelution. GREAT venue! They have a green room for before the show, a rooftop bar, awesome staff and very comfortable seating upstairs. The sound is really good and the vibrations from the music make me move. I love this place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustJanJan
50,Great place to see a show...,"Great theatre that has been refurbished and returned to life. It kinda reminds me of the wiltern as no seats on the floorâ€”- ya gotta dance and twirl. Old folks get reserved seats upstairs. Holds maybe 2000.Bar on the roof that was closed when we attended Oteil and friends.Easy parking, several eateries nearby. Great place to see a show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
