50,Old school since 1917,"I was invited to an event to see The Great Leap. The patio area is a nice place to hang out before the show starts and they offered complimentary wine, how can you beat that. I didn't know what the play was about and during the opening scene I wanted to walk out. I stuck around and started enjoying the show as it started to come together until the unique ending. I highly recommend enjoying a night out at this classic playhouse.",Creeping_Death_LA

50,"""A Kid Like Jake"" - Pasadena Playhouse - ""PHENOMENAL Acting - Excellent Production!!""","Four of us just saw IAMA's production of ""A Kid Like Jake"" at the Pasadena Playhouse - Carrie Hamilton Theatre - and were all wowed! The actors are so talented we couldn't stop commenting how real the play was, as though they weren't acting at all. Truly a phenomenal performance. The stage set was very detailed,appropriate and drew all of us in to feeing like we were in the living room with this couple. The energy from the audience was apparent as we all felt the emotions of the actors. We met the actors afterwards, all of whom are so talented and humble. They all praised the producer, Lexi Sloan, for being supportive and making the show an astonishing success. Haven't seen this height of talent in a long time. Small intimate upstairs theater, all seats are great. Grab a quick bite nearby before the show and have a wonderful evening! Only $5 for parking directly across the street. We highly recommend this performance!!",brownizeGirl
50,Always a great venue,"So, this is a small venuethat has great leg room and comfortable seats.... being older, it does not have a great bathroom facilities, and the floor seating could use some incline from front to back as it's pretty flat.... on a differnt note, the production of Little Shop of Horrors was great!",markj4golf
50,"Excellent Production - ""Tiny Beautiful Things""","We took out-of-town visitors to three shows during the week - Pantages, ""Singing in the Rain"" in La Mirada, and here for Nia Vardalos in ""Tiny Beautiful Things"". This was my favorite. The venerable 100 year old theater is charming, set in a nice area of Pasadena with many places to visit and dine nearby. We got last minute seats that were nicely situated in the theater and the play was extraordinary. The actors were very talented; the show was one of those wonderfully inspirational experiences that a person walks away from, with a lighter heart and a good dose of joy. Our guests thought that we were so insightful to bring them to such an excellent production, but that was totally by chance - we had no idea that it would be so good. Highly recommended!",RangerBobN

40,Love it here,"This is a intimate theatre that seats a couple hundred and is very comfortable... shows are hit and miss as I have seen great shows here (Fences, Janis Joplin), and not so great (will leave they nameless), but this is a venue review, not a show review, and I do love the Pasadena Playhouse.",markj4golf
50,Not a bad seat in the house,"I enjoy going to plays and the Pasadena Playhouse is a nice place to see small theatre plays. It was built about 100 years ago and has that Southern California 1920s feel about it. The internal architecture is 1920s also. I saw “The Woman in Black” which was a gothic horror on a minimalist stage. After the show, as we were waiting in line for the restroom, we ladies agreed the acoustics were terrible but the play was very good. If you are in LA try and see a play in one of the more historic theaters. A lot of stars from the 20s and 30s started there. And after the play right next to the Playhouse is Trejos Cantina..Muy buen",Skyros7
40,Really great little theater.,"This classic has been in business for over 100 years. We've been a season ticket holders off and on for over 25 years. Back in the 80s, the plays were unbelievably amazing. Then they went through a period of really boring plays that put us to sleep, literally. Since it was a very expensive nap, we cancelled our seats. Recently, with a change at the top, we decided to try it out again and we're happy we did. Definitely worth checking it out.",Elaine P
50,FANTASTIC VENUE!! BUY TICKETS ON GOLDSTAR,"My husband and I love the Pasadena Playhouse. The staff are all so helpful and professional. The setting is intimate and the crew puts so much effort into the set design. We purchase our tickets on Goldstar for a significant discount.

I highly recommend!",Robyn P
40,Historic theater,"It appears some of the reviews are about the performances and the productions rather than the theater itself. However, I will focus on the institution itself. It has been around for many decades and it is well worth a visit. The orchestra seats are good and you get a good view of the stage. The acoustics are good and the atmosphere is fine. This is probably not what you would call a top-of-the-line theater but is certainly an enjoyable experience in in the store exciting.",vincemc
40,Belleville not so Belle forbthebkeads - Great acting,"The reviews have been really mixed. We saw the show Last evening and I think it is fair to say that it is a slice of life. One thing for sure it stays with you. People say dark, depressing etc etc. I say thought provoking. It was hard to watch and a little too long but We enjoying seeing a wide range of theater. Life and theater are not always seen through rose color glasses. It juxtaposes life of 2 Americans that or totally disfunctional to that of two Parisians thatcseem tonbebhars working but have their own problems that are the ying and yang of the play. It’s a pattern of lies, sex and two people that have lost their way. It takes all types of people to fill this world and it is one couples story that ends tragically!!",Cape-SoCal
20,Acting was great,"Anna Camp was wonderful, but, the play was confusing especially since it was difficult to hear some of the dialogue and then the French was thrown in without clarification... it was 90 minutes of easedropping on someone's bad marriage.",reneelancon
10,Avoid “Belleville”,"Long drawn out play about two self centered people without a clue. Writing is slow and unclear, actors made the best of a bad situation. The directing was awful, slow and painful. The plot never develops the tension it’s trying to build. Love big periods of self absorbed dead time on stage and scenes where the audience is baffled by the scene’s value to the play (ie, the final scene where the two property managers are cleaning the apartment as the wife leaves in a rush. They speak French to each other and after 5 minutes the lights go down and the audience is left to get out of dodge). All in all it’s a wonder to me why anyone would produce this listless plodding excuse to art.",Commercialtourist

It's not a large theater, would guess it's capacity at 800-900 seats; the small size gives a feeling of intimacy with what's happening on stage.

Lots of bars and coffee places in the area for a bite before or after theatre. During intermission if you act quickly you can get a snack from their concession located outside in the courtyard. If you haven't been to the playhouse here, definitely book yourself a show...and go. You'll enjoy the theatre and the area. We saw Al Pacino tonight. Since the show closes on Sunday, I won't review this show.",Nancy D
10,"Beautiful theater, but don't waste your money on ""God Looked Away""","Even though watching Al Pacino was a great experience... the first act of ""God looked away"" was a painfully slow disappointment. I felt duped for paying so much money for a matinee ticket ($120)! I can't imagine how the entire cast is unaware of the scattered mess they are working with, but perhaps they have convinced themselves that is not that bad. Thank goodness for Judith Light who saved the second act, by injecting a large dose of much needed energy. The flat, pitiful ending, felt like a relief. I still cannot understand why the entire audience decided to give the cast a standing ovation. I didn't even bother to clap. And I'm not even going to get into the fact that play audiences in Los Angeles are terribly rude! A woman behind me cleared her throat throughout THE ENTIRE PLAY! RUDE!In conclusion, save your money. Not worth seeing, even if you get a free ticket.",MrsCDinLA
30,Disappointing and waste of money,Ridiculously expensive tickets for a matinee and the performance was interrupted multiple times by:late arrivals who should not have been seated because they disrupted those of us who had arrived on time -ushers talking -someone's medical device alarm going off -rattling racks of who knows what being wheeled just outside the exit door on the orchestra level,suemA6588TU
10,Lovely playhouse ... Awful play,"God Looked Away is clearly a benefit production for the Pasadena Playhouse. Billed as a ""workshop"" it is appalling bad and not ready for an audience, much less one that is paying as much as $200 for ticket. If it's important for you to breathe the same air as Al Pacino then by all means go for it. However if you actually have an interest in good theater, try one of the smaller local playhouses. Cheaper and much better theater.",SallyForthFromHere

Al Pacino was wonderful and I enjoyed seeing him in live theater.",MSO70
50,Great theatre,"My wife and I went to see Al Pacino in God Looked Away. This theatre is wonderful. It has the most leg room and best seating angles that I've ever seen (and I've seen many) This is definitely the most comfortable theatre I've ever attended. The only minor downside is the bar is outside which could be a pain in chilly weather. TIP: use the bar next door. Much to my surprise the bar drinks are cheaper than the theatre bar. The bar will also give you drinks in plastic cups to take in to the theatre. Oh yeah, AlPacino was great!",WFSCDGA

50,Irving Berlin with Hershey Felder,"I live in the area, but this was my first time going to the Playhouse. The show I saw was excellent. There were so many great songs (also classics!) I loved the performance so much, I went back to see it again a week later before it closed. I would've truly enjoyed seeing and talking to the actor after the show, but the staff didn't want to tell me where the stage door was. A nice little theatre, none the less. I hope to return again soon.",cassidy256
50,Irving Berlin: extraordinary production,"The playhouse is charming, small and reminiscent of theaters of the 40s and 50s. In the show we saw, Hershey Felder (an accomplished pianist, singer and actor) made Irving Berlin come alive with the backstory for many of Berlin's hits. It felt like a fireside chat that included videos of his songs sung by Ethel Merman, Al Jolsen, and Fred Astaire. The production is given as if he was talking to the audience. We were encouraged to sing a number of familiar songs but the show stopper was God Bless America. Everyone around us were wiping the tears while softly singing the song. Fantastic show and well deserving of the standing O.",1945nfr
50,Wonderful facility for shows,Just saw Irving Berlin at the Pasadena Playhouse. The one man show is incredible! I'll talk about that elsewhere because here I have to say that the Playhouse is great. It is a smaller theater - I doubt there is a bad seat but I was in row BB in the Mezzanine and I had great view of the stage and the sound was excellent. The location of the Playhouse is so good; parking is cheap - $5 across the street; there are plenty of restaurants within a mile of the theater.

After dinner and dessert nearby, we enjoyed pre-theater ambiance under the stars and lighting in the patio area. There was plenty of parking options and we chose the street for free within a block. As we entered the theater, the decor was rich and full of almost a 100 years of history. The seats were fairly comfortable and there was a great sense of intimacy as the director welcomed us before the show. Bathroom facilities are limited with some downstairs and some upstairs which takes planning for women. Almost at the onset of the show, we had a deep sense of disappointment with the acting and the writing. We waited until intermission and then left quickly thinking that the quality has lost its luster at the Playhouse.",sherrieseg

I hope that she can contribute to the diversity that is so needed by the organization and the community! It is about time to present more multi diverse plays and performances at the Playhouse. ""Waterfall"" is definitely a great example (which reminds me of themes prevalent in musicals such as Miss Saigon, King and I and West Side Story) to start catering to the multi-Asian communities that encompasses Pasadena, Arcadia and its surrounding areas. Wishing Ms. Sueko and its new team of the Playhouse to do more and to keep this historical theatre.",PeaceINdance
50,"""Waterfall"" delivers!","We both thoroughly enjoyed this romantic love story that is headed for Broadway in 2016, where it will cost at least three times more to see. Very good story, acting, singing, costumes, and the waterfall set was one of the prettiest sets we've seen during over 40 years of theater going. The playhouse is beautiful, comfortable, and has a friendly staff. Free parking at several places on the street on Sunday's and after 6:00 the rest of the week; a metered lot behind the playhouse; paid lots within the block for $7-10.

We started with the highly acclaimed “Union”.The “Whipping Man” at the Playhouse was the central ingredient for our stay. We were lucky with a brilliant performance as we actually came just to enjoy a live acting effort in a place of so much theatrical tradition.Besides the very atmospheric interior the play itself than turned out to be quite captivating. It is astonishing for me as an European, how strongly race and religion still resonate in American society – this experience was even heightened just 2 days after watching the Oscars.Bathrooms could be seen as a drawback! Obviously they were not needed by so many when this theate was built some 80 years ago!10 p.m. play over – SURPRISE – Pasadena had shut down – not even a cab at the theatre!!!",Walter S
40,The Whipping Man,"Very good production with top notch directing, acting, and writing. Set in Richmond just after the Civil War, a wounded Confederate soldier returns to his ruined plantation where two former family slaves wait. They were raised in the ""master's"" religion - they were all Jewish. Without giving anything away, it makes for a thoughtprovoking story that had us talking all the way home. The Playhouse offers excellent seating from the stage to the last row downstairs. The balcony has stairs only, no elevator. Ample paid parking all around the theater. Also free street parking if you arrive early enough. Snacks and drinks bar. There are several restaurants within walking distance.

Since it was the day after Christmas everything was festive and everyone was in the holiday mood. Really enjoyed walking into the Playhouse as it is older, has such a history, and the architecture is so beautiful and unique. Our seats were in the balcony and were perfect for the occasion. We saw ""Sleeping Beauty and her Winter Knight "" which was fun. Had never seen a PANTO before which was quite interesting and unique. A Panto are scripts rewritten each year from historical fairy tales. This includes ever changing music sourced from Billboard chart with jokes, jabs and slang from modern day. Lots of young kids in audience who most likely understood most of the humor and songs that fit the scenes being performed. Think it brings family together by having things for the young and young at heart!! Lucy Lawless was terrific!!!!!!!!!",48thAnniversary

You want to jump up and move with them.We took our 15 year-old [""I only want my iPhone and my room""] and she thoroughly enjoyed herself.Catch this production before it ends and you'll never see Kiss Me Kate in the same way.Bravo Pasadena Playhouse.",Dave D

Others in our group had the same problem even though they, like me didn't have hearing aids due to poor hearing to start with.I was disappointed that when, at intermission I asked about amplified hearing they were all in use and others who were smart enough to get one before the play started said it was still to hear/understand.I'd suggest seeing about a tour when the theater isn't running a play and perhaps make sure that your hearing is top notch.A waste of $$$$ for me and even my wife who has very sharp hearing had a hard time hearing some of the play.",Travelerzz2
40,Song at Twilight,"I'm a Noel Coward fan and it was delightful to see this presented by such wonderful actors. I'm sure Noel would have been very pleased with every aspect of this production. The set is quite elegant and ambitious and really adds to the play. We had absolutely no trouble hearing. We've been to this theater many, many times and always marvel at how pretty it is, inside and out. This time we sat in the front row, but I honestly don't believe there's a bad seat downstairs. Before the play begins, I urge you to read the section in the playbill about Sir John Gielgud; it will give you an even better understanding of the times depicted in the play.",Linda C
50,"Great play, great performance...and we heard every word.","We saw this play on the second night of the performance and thoroughly enjoyed it. The pacing, acting and sets were so engaging that the time sort of flew by. The play, though not complex in its themes, certainly engendered a lot of discussion between us after the performance.We also had no trouble hearing any of the dialogue. I am not a young person, and my hearing is not great (lifelong musician) and we sat way up in the balcony, and still had no trouble hearing. Maybe sound was corrected from the previous reviewer's first night attendance, but I just want to make assurances that we had no problems at all hearing the play, and definitely feel it is a play--and performance--worth seeing, by all means.",Chris E
10,Song at Twilight,"We (4) went to see last night's play with high expectations since Noel Coward's works are genuinely excellent but was VERY disappointed with the play. The major problem which has occurred several times is the sound. We were not able to hear the words of any of the performers and even the ear piece I checked out wasn't working. My other friends didn't need hearing devices and couldn't get the words either. For the last 3 plays, the hearing device has been broken and I only get static. The sound folks just don't get it since this is an ongoing problem. One of the ladies with a badge around her neck stated that it takes a week for the sound to be correct. If this is true,they shouldn't be presenting the play until the sound is high quality.I will finish up whatever tickets are in my series but neither couple will purchase any further plays from Pasadena Playhouse. We left at the break and so did many others who were in the line to return the hearing device.I have been a Pasadena Playhouse supporter for many, many years but I will no longer pay for tickets when I can't hear the play.",ladydocas123
50,Wonderful theater in dining mecca,"Highly recommend the play, Above the Fold in adobe-style early California theatre with charming courtyard; comfortable seats with plenty of leg room, in walking distance to numerous excellent dining options. Free street and reasonably priced pkg lot nearby. Drive the neighborhood to view the manses and Getty Library/gardens.",CynthiaNP
50,Beautiful & Historic Theatre,"Beautifully restored theatre. Comfortable seating. Small, intimate setting. Also has a nice patio area to mingle during intermission. Creative productions, with top-caliber talent.",ReadyToWander
40,Wonderful venue,"Our visit to the playhouse was actually four years ago. We try to attend local theaters when traveling, and this is one of the best.",Sanmigueleno
50,Aladdin at the Pasadena Playhouse,Just saw this Panto and it is a great show with Ben Vareen and some Disney-Nickelodean stars. Fun music. Take your kids age 7 and up. Comedy is awesome.,Stella E
30,Gidion's Knot by furious theatre Co.,"11.15.2013 - saw Gidion's Knot by the furious theatre Co., written by Johanna Adams, directed by Darin Anthony. The contents clearly garnered from controversial headlines; suicide of 9-years old student after being suspended for writing about violence. The bitter mother seeks vengence, assaulted teacher. The language was most troubling.The set was arranged like a school-room. Seats very cramped and uncomfortable for 80 mins.No intermission. Old building.",3Kells
30,Former season ticket holders,"Used to be season ticketholders for a fair number of years; however play selection moved too far from our interests. Now buy one-off tickets every year or so. Also, seems like they have a lot of interim concert type shows now.Historic place and certainly worth seeing a play there; however trending in the wrong direction.",packcal
40,Friendly and nostalgic,"Nostalgic and nice to look at. The seating was comfortable, and we could see the stage easily. The main con was the woman's restroom was a line before the show, at intermission, and of course after.",A_V_Wedding_Lady
10,Christmas show was the worst,"Its bad enough to pay over the top for tickets, but then be insulted with rude people feeding their faces and old perverts making out with young ladies in the balcony, totally disappointed.",Opie T
30,Programing is of interest,"The place definitely has Old California Charm. We frequently travel for entertainment in the ""LA area"", and the Pasadena Playhouse is one of many theaters we go to (though not a complete list, our main sites are all the theaters at the LA Music Center, artsy movie theaters all around LA, El Portal Theater in NoHo, Broad Street theater in Santa Monica, OC Performing arts on occasion, and least frequently to Cerrritos Performing Arts). The Pasadena Playhouse definitely has shows of interest, including the recent Cirque Palooza 2 week extravaganza.What the theater needs badly though is a refurbishing of the seats inside. They are completely cheezy and ""squalorous""!I still love it though, and it is still on my list.",DrJR17
50,Wonderful Venue,"Built in the mid 20s, Pasadena Playhouse is a gem of design and comfort. From the art deco auditorium to the dramatic outdoor spaces, this place is worth a visit.",rudynostalgia
40,Intimate Theater with history and class,"This is a gem of an old theater, with an awesome history and pedigree. It's struggled to keep local live theater alive, and deserves suppot. As an architectural and design piece, the place is worth visiting on its own, but go for a show!",drfertig
50,Great Venue,"This is a Broadway quality theater that will rival the beauty of any of them. And there is a great restaurant right next door, so you don't have to go far. They put on really great shows. I have loved every one of them.",MalibuAgoura
40,Review based on actual playhouse not the play,This place is impressive. I loved the theatre. We were sitting in the back but still had a great view. Our play was not great but still the building was great! Food trucks are out in front so make sure to be there with plenty of time if you want to buy food because there are long lines. Food truck food is worth it though.,Maritza_Cha
40,One Of The Best Playhouses In San Gabriel Valley,"I really love the Pasadena Playhouse, it is one of my favorite playhouses in the San Gabriel Valley because it is a nice size to see plays. Honestly, even if you sit in the nose bleed section (I often frequent because it's more affordable for both my husband & I) you can still see the stage down below just fine.I love the different types of plays featured at this playhouse because a lot of them do appeal to me. Ticket prices are pretty affordable for my husband and I to make it a date night every so often.I really like that there is an outdoor open quad right in front of the theater. It is a nice place to gather and mingle between intermission and before a play starts. You can also choose to smoke out here (but you really shouldn't because it's quite nasty on your lungs and others around you) and buy drinks here. I also like that there is a restroom area on the 2nd floor (which you have to get to through this outdoor quad, you can't get there if you are inside the theater). This restroom is less populated than the one inside the theater, which is on the 1st floor.The structure of this theater is beautiful as well. I love to see the vintage and old style structure inside and out of this building.One negative thing about this place though that I have to say is the seats aren't too comfortable (although I have sat in worse and less padded seats). I also wished that the aisles between seats were a little larger so that it would be easier for people to walk pass you (but then again, that would make it harder for you to see the stage if the seats were further away).Overall, have always received friendly service (ushers and ticket box office staff) and love seeing plays here. Also really love that you can just park a few blocks away in the residential streets to avoid paying for parking (unlike other theaters in L.A. where there are no places for you to park for free).",meowmix318
50,A Must See: Sleepless In Seattle The Musical,"Excellent cast, fantastic voices, uplifting. A wonderful new musical to see. The cookies during intermission were delicious but that was an added bonus to a great show.",ladydocas123
50,Awesome Performance,My sister and I are / were BIG fans of Janis. My sister actually saw her perform twice. The show at the Playhouse right now....A Night with Janis Joplin.....is like seeing Janis for real.....it was AWESOME and I am so glad we were able to see it. I was blown away by the lead actress.....she is Janis reincarnate. Don't miss this show if you are a fan.,Kris5566
50,Janis Joplin,My wife & I went to see a musical about Janis Joplin at The Pasadena Playhouse and it was incredible! Not only did the lead singer Mary Bridget Davies sound like Janice but Sabrina Elayne Carten was fantastic as The Blues Singer. If you have an opportunity ( I believe it will be running only until April 19 ) to see and hear a great musical by all means go. Also the Pasadena Playhouse is a small theater so wherever you sit will be just fine.,kobefanla
50,Don't miss this!,"We went to 'A Night with Janis Joplin'. I am not a big fan of hers but... The show was great! It was a mix of Janis and others who influenced her music. The gal performing as Janis was very good. The music and diaglog were right on. Don't want to say much about what's going to happen but if you like Janis - don't miss this. One friend called today to ask if we could go again! Everyone loved it! The theater is so incredible. If you are in Pasadena, don't miss seeing the Playhouse. Someone told me it was built around 1917.. it's so cool!",Leona0212
50,One Night with Janis Joplin,"If you were/are a Joplin fan, do yourself a favor and RUSH to the Pasadena Playhouse to see/hear Mary Bridget Davies. She's amazing! There were times during the show that we thought Janis had returned from Rock N' Roll Heaven to entertain us - she's THAT good. We listened to Janis' CDs all the way to Pasadena and all the way home afterwards, so it was easy to compare the singing of Mary and Janis - Mary nails it! Hubby saw Janis live in concert eons ago, and said it was like turning back the clock. We walked out of the show decades younger. Get tickets now!",Linda C
50,Intimate theater in Pasadena,The Pasadena Playhouse is a lovely intimate theater with no bad seats. I'm sure the enjoyment depends on the play you see and we saw a very funny Noel Coward play that I enjoyed immensely. It would be nicer if there were better refreshments and facilities for them but that is my only complaint.,JoyceKing
50,Flashback,"The beautiful Pasadena Playhouse, refurbished to its original turn of the century elegance is a favorite of ours. It is intimate, ticket prices are reasonable, and performances are outstanding. A must visit when in Pasadena.",DrForgot
50,Small but Attractive Theater,Went to a performance of Snow White's Enchanted Christmas. It was a very nice show. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I liked this theater. It was small but had a very cozy feel to it. Would see another show at this theater in the future.,bobaloo000
20,Historic Arts Center,"The Pasadena Playhouse is a historic performing arts theater that is located at 39 S El Molino Avenue in Pasadena, California. The 686-seat auditorium is a gem and a venue that should not be missed. The lines of sight in this small theater are excellent, making every seat a good seat from which to watch the live productions. Even the small balcony provides a great view of the stage and the sound quality is exceptional. However, as good or great as the productions are at this theater, I think the management of this theater is a problem. At my most recent production, Intimate Apparel, the production began late. I have yet to attend a production here that begins at the posted time. If your ticket states an 8:00pm start time, then expect to start at least 10 -15 minutes late. Unfortunately this is the case in most of LA live theater. This would be unheard of in New York! I know the excuses, traffic and parking, but that will not change in LA. So given that why don't the patrons leave their homes a bit earlier? The ushers at this theater are also a problem. They chat with each other once the production has begun. They clearly forget the alphabetic principal, as they cannot seem to direct patrons to their correct rows, which go from B to T in the orchestra level. Patrons arrive late, chatting, with cell phones on, drinks in hand, oversized bags swinging while attempting to maneuver their assigned rows. Cells phones go off, patrons text, and hold conversations with each other. The chatter from the lobby can be heard in the back orchestra rows, and no one attempts to correct this. For all the beauty of the theater, and the untiring work of the actors, the theater and the actors get no respect.",gr8puck
50,Backstage Tour,"If you cannot attend a performance in this classic theater....or even if you can, do check out their website to arrange a backstage private tour of about one hour. It is a fascinating look at early Pasadena and the life of the city. The theater is California's most historic one, and the dedicated guides are wonderful. Make a donation afterwards as we did.",ErnDev
40,Nice little playhouse,It's small but the intimacy lends to the experience. Most enjoyable. It's also a fun place to people-watch.,Puttermutt17
40,where the stars were born,"The Playhouse has gone through ups and downs the last 30 years, but it is probably the most famous theatre on the West Coast in terms of how many stars got their start there. Check out its pedigree on Wikipedia and marvel at who performed there.",enroute55
40,Pasadena landmark of great entertainment,The shows are creative in a beautiful setting. We just had a memorable and entertaining evening with the production of Jitney. The entire Playhouse District is worth a visit with a wide variety of restaurants to choose from to enjoy before or after the production for dinner.*Be prepared to pay for parking.,Konstandena

50,beautiful 100 year old jewel box theatre,"Here in the center of ""new"" Pasadena is a theatre that would be worth a visit just for its architectural interest. But it offers everything one could desire in a great evening of theatre, with superb acoustics, excellent sightlines, comfortable seating and an elegant old world atmosphere. The lobby is small and the restrooms could use updating. Play offerings are varied and sophisticated. Current offerings include a trilogy of shows by the incomparably multi-talented actor/musician Hershey Felder as well as an improv group staging shows in the character of Jane Austen novels. The Felder show is a must-see.",Alan H
30,Grand old place,Just hope they can stay afloat! Great place to see small stage productions.,cvcalifornia
40,Nice and charming theater,"We've been to Pasadena Playhouse a couple of times in 2011 for two musicals. The theater is medium size, not too small, and not too large. It's pretty cozy. There's pay parking across the street, but we just looked for street parking and walked to the playhouse. The seats are pretty comfortable and upholstered.",Pon N
50,One of best little theatres anywhere!,Wonderful little theatre with lots of history and architectural appeal and the shows are top quality...3 went to 'Broadway!,divabo
40,I'M SO PROUD OF OUR THEATRE,"The Playhouse is beautiful, hisotorical and it's ours. The program has improved every year under Sheldon Epps.I'm never disappointed",BETTY S
40,A wonderful small theater with many wonderful productions,"I love this little theater and have seen many things over the years here. It's my first small theater love in Old Town Pasadena and if you want a ring side seat where most every seat is a good one, this is the place.",married&inlove
40,Small enough to touch the actors!,"Go to the Pasadena Playhouse, and be sure to stop in the bar downstairs for cocktails and entertainment first. The Playhouse is small and intimate - makes you feel like you're a part of the production. We saw Cyclops - a Rock Opera while we were there - what a great show. If you stay afterwards, you can chat with the actors on the outside balcony.",eviehm
50,Wonderful theatre - always a great time,"This good-sized theatre doesn't have a bad seat in the house. They have excellent, thoughtful productions of great shows - many with designs on Broadway. Have dinner at Roy's at the corner of El Molino and Colorado and walk to the theater. A perfect So Cal evening!",lonestarali
