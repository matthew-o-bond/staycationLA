10,Customer of 40 years Leaving,"I have been with Bank of America for over 40 years as well as my ex husband of 30 years. I visited the local branch near Clearwater Beach in September and October to explain that my ex husband had obtained a new email address that was similar to mine and that I had received several emails with his account information as he has several. I explained that I had spoken with my ex husband regarding this issue and because we are amicable it was an immediate concern. I asked them to rectify the situation. Two days later I received two more emails for his accounts. I went back to the local branch and again explained to the same advisor that it had not been resolved. After receiving several more, I went in a third time.On November 14th, I received a notice that my debit card was compromised as I had a charge of $1300 for a rental car in West Virginia. I complied with all that Bank of America required of me on line. The next evening I used my debit card at a local merchant and it was declined. I immediately checked my balance and the account was up to date. I then had a business transaction the next morning where I needed to withdraw funds to secure the deal. My card again was denied. I again checked my balance and all funds were there in my checking account. I went back to the local branch as time was of essence to secure the transaction. I waited 45 minutes to see the same advisor. She advised me that my account was not accessible to me and I would be receiving a new debit card in the mail in 7 businesses days. I explained to her that I needed to access my money immediately as I was in the middle of a business transaction to secure $10,000 dollars. At this time, I texted my business partner and I had lost the deal due to the two hours before trying to access my money. I explained that to the representative for Bank of America and her response was she could issue me a temporary card until my new debit card arrived. I asked her if Bank of America would reimburse me the $10,000 I had just lost due to no notification from them that my money wasn't available. She asked me what type of business I was in. I explained investments. I then let her know I would be withdrawing all of my money out and transferring to another banking institution. I asked her for a form to withdraw my money from my Merrill Edge account as well. Her response was that she could have me wait to see an advisor to take care of that. Since I had already lost money and spent over an hour at the bank I declined and walked out!After being a preferred customer for many years and that is the level of service I received, my money and anyone else I know who currently banks with them are gone!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blessings32015
