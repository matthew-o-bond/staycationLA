50,Saints Game,"Even though we lost the game and our QB, we really enjoyed the atmosphere. Fans, security, vendors and pretty much everybody was SUPER nice, both before and after the game. I was glad I got to go to a game there while it was still standing and before the new one opened!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xraylady1021
50,"And so, to Inglewood...","It’s probably the last time I will see the Rams at their original home. At the end of 2020 they move to play at their brand new multi-billion dollar home in Inglewood. Where the sound of “Whose house is this...? RAMS HOUSE!!!” will be a chant that makes absolute sense. Built as a memorial to veterans of the First World War in 1921; it will get the opportunity to do what it was designed to one more time in 2028... to host a Summer Olympics. I went along on a beautiful LA Winter’s evening to see the Rams take on the Ravens. Not the result we hoped for. The Ravens looked unstoppable all evening and the Rams were effectively out of play off contention by the end of the evening. But the atmosphere was superb nevertheless and the $14 cans of beer were being washed down in healthy quantities before those cans are recycled and turned into RSJ joints for Inglewood’s new retractable root. Los Angeles Tycoonary at it’s beautiful, lovely, American Dream best. Everyone coming together with smiles on their faces to see a quality of show that only Americans know how to host. Aloe Blacc put on a superb half time show and despite the result already sliding away; the crowd were on the feet with premium beer in hand. The chilli dogs were superb and made out of pure premium 100% beef. They were half the price of the can of beer so I guess everything evened itself out... apart from Jared Goff still hasn’t married me. See you in Inglewood... shout it loud and proud: “RAMS HOUSE!!”... Howay the Lads and we are Geordies!! See you soon Los Angeles or should I say (Geordie Shore)...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jassimalkanani
50,Honours veterans of World War I,"Home to USC’s Trojans football team, this fine stadium was unveiled in 1923.

40,Historic stadium,"You can take the light rail to USC and walk a few minutes to the stadium, best way to avoid cost of parking and traffic. The walk takes you past the rose garden, so you might want to plan to get there before your event for a few photo ops. There are few stadiums that have weathered the test of time and this is one of them. I hope it stays in tact for many years to come even if it isn't the best stadium for viewing football (avoid corner near the torch).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BriardM0m

40,LOVE or HATE USC TROJANS AND FOOTBALL!,"Hey guys!! Do you remember Pete Carroll and the USC Trojans circa 2003? Carson Palmer and Matt Leinhart and the whole crew and gang of USC football!!! THOSE WERE THE DAYS! We had so much fun hanging out at the Coliseum in good old times with our besties at USC circa 2003--that was the generation and the days..and now what do you see? Not the same era of football. I DID GO TO THE USC COLISEUM AND I FEEL VERY BLESSED AND LUCKY FOR THAT! That was history. It's in Los Angeles, California and it's a historical ampitheatre for football mainly. It should be used for the Olympics. It's incredible that it still stands but it's in a strange place in Los Angeles and it's hard to get to for some other Los Angeles residents. I would like to visit the Coliseum again. When you are a USC student, it feels that easy to get your college sports card and see what happens..the beer will slosh and you will hang out with some fratties and tatties and see that you will have the best days of your life at the USC COLISEUM!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluestravelerz

40,USC beats UCLA,"The Coliseum's new upgrade is nice. Good screens, great presentation and traditions i.e. lighting of the torch, etc. Of course the USC traditions played out during the game are wonderful. Selling alcohol only in the Clubs has two bad effects - 1. people are not in their seats and that takes away from the experience and support of the teams and 2. when half time is there, the clubs are so crowded that good service is difficult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadwarrior50

The Coliseum has hosted major events such as the 1932 Olympics, 1984 Olympics, 1959 World Series, Super Bowl 1, Super Bowl 7, etc. The stadium was previously home to the Los Angeles Dodgers, before Dodger Stadium, the Los Angeles Raiders, the Rams before moving to St Louis, and the San Diego Chargers.

Sure it's a bit dilapidated and amenities are basic and functional but there's a real atmosphere in the open air with the olympic rings and torch towering over proceedings.

Parked 15 mins away in a residential street (free parking) and was an easy walk in ($5 UBER back after game as not safest area after dark and alone).On arrival I experienced the tailgate outside the stadium and the Rams Fan Zone , both excellent.On entering the stadium I was contacted by someone in the Rams media team who had noticed I had arrived from Australia for the game. They met me and presented me with a t-shirt and other merch which was a great gesture.The game itself was great, the seat was amazing with an unreal view of the mountains and the City skyline in the distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G733NWOOD
50,Iconic Stadium!,"We recently attended the Niners-Rams game on December 30th at this iconic stadium. A real highlight personally, as this stadium has been in so many great sporting events in my lifetime. As a Niners fan, well, not a great day! The experience of touring around this site and taking in the sites and sounds was really exciting. We had decent seats, in the end zone at the west end. They were better than I expected. Initially, I felt the stadium was not a great spot to watch as it is still laid out for a track, but surprisingly, it did look like those seats on the sideline were good. Food prices are, well, stupid. We ate before hand at one restaurant at the soccer stadium on site. Entry to the stadium was decent, but hindered by the construction at the gate we came in at. I would suggest that anyone coming should add in time to take it all in! Definitely worth it. As for parking, obviously, public transit is best. If you have to drive (and we did), there were actually quite a few spots about 4 -5 blocks up across from USC that cost us NOTHING!! Repeat- $0. So, take it in, enjoy the experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/316timl
40,Eagles vs Rams 2018,"Despite being an obvious fan of the visiting team, Coliseum staff were helpful, friendly and welcoming of all the visitors to their venue.

Most fans were very friendly. Our seats were toward the ""band"" end zone on the visitors side. Lots of construction but nothing to stop enjoyment of the game. Our seats were nearly in the center of the row but most people were polite about going out. Sight lines were very good and the jumbo screens were good for replays and other displays. Leaving was a bit crowded but not too bad. There were lots of food choices available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1GiantsMS

Used metro return from DTLA with no problems.So much history attached to the venue - Carl Lewis winning four gold medals at the 84' Summer Olympics is a strong memory.The seats are showing their age & are quite narrow but as with most NFL/NBA live viewing there is a lot of time spent on your feet anyway.There was a large crowd in attendance who saw the Rams win in a really close match.

40,Great Venue,"This place is huge and old. There is some renovating going on and to host an NFL game with the PACKERS in town is a huge undertaking. The wait for the bathrooms was long, and the food and beer wait was even longer. We ended up not purchasing any food or beverage because we came to see the game, not wait in line. The stadium is great for football, very similar to Lambeau. I do love old architecture and the history of the building. The rose garden outside the gates is beautiful. The RAMS fans sitting in our area were quite friendly during the entire game. There were even a couple RAMS fans that helped one of our group up the steps who needed assistance (double knee replacement). All in all, a very nice experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnlyMeDSW
10,Wow.... so bad!,This coliseum should have been torn down decades ago. Not only is it just in really poor condition but trying to attend a NFL game here was excruciating! We waited almost an hour trying to get in (thinking that getting there 30 min early would get us through the gates in time for kickoff). So unorganized and way too few gates/entrances. This will be the first and last time I come here for a game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cogreeneyz
40,Don’t make them like this anymore!,"Came to the packers-rams game for the history and to see my favourite team, The Packers. The sourronding area is not the cleanest and if you drive to a game expect to pay between $50 and $100 to park. The local policy do a fair job closing roads and guiding people out but it would still take an hour depending on where you park.The venue itself allows you to enter on 2 levels and stairs are very steep. They currently have construction under way to improve the stadium for upcoming summer olympics?If you go, take transit, metro line Blue. Try to get a ticket on the south side, not facing the sun. Get seats lower tan row 65, makes for less stair climbing. Seats and rows are narrow, watch your step.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanL514
40,Iconic But....,"It is iconic to visit knowing the history that has occurred at the Coliseum It was need to see the torch lit during the Vikings and Rams game. The tailgate area was very good and had a good mix of entertainment and food. It also has some great historical memoirs and plaquesNow the but...Concessions were expensive (like the food truck ideas) but that still didn't stop people from purchasing too much beer. Security was completely lax as people were smoking swearing and toking in the stands and if you can't smell it as a security then you must not have smell senses.Parking is limited and expensive so I recommend taking transit, The seats are old and thank goodness I won a seat pad at the tailgate.Still great to be at a game site with so much history just brace yourself for some of the distractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avgjoey

40,Great stadium to see a game,First time attending a game here. Went to the Vikings/Rams game and had a great time. Food and beer are a bit pricey but very good - get an LA Street Dog. Not really a bad seat in the house. Rams fans were great and heckled us Vikes fans with humor. Only complaint is getting out of stadium. It was packed and took longer to leave than expected. But it was a nice night so didn't really bother us. Hope to go back to catch a USC game.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dans645
50,Thursday Night Rams vs Vikings!,"Been a Rams fan My whole life. Remember my early years rooting for Merlin Olsen, Jack Youngblood, Jack Snow and Roman Gabriel just to name a few. Had the pleasure of watching the Rams play in the Colisium for the first and last time. Being from South Jersey I wanted to take advantage of them playing back in the Colisium like when I was a kid. They didn't disappoint. Man what a game. Goff, Gurley, Kupp, Woods and Cooks look unstoppable. Donald, Suh and Peters on defense. Are you kidding me. It's a dream come true. Thanks Goff for a five touchdown night and sending those stinking Vikings & their obnoxious fans packing. So glad I got to see the Colisium. Looking forward to the new stadium in the near future.

20,Rams vs. Vikings,"Took the bus from Echo Park to the Coliseum. It’s the 200 line if anyone wants to know.The traffic was so bad we hopped off about a mile from drop off. TRAFFIC.. was a mess. Even though we chose to take a bus hoping to avoid the stand still of traffic it was still a nightmare.I would recommend getting there early to avoid the stress of traffic.Once we got to the gates to enter it was pure chaos. Nobody helping direct traffic or lines or keeping things civil . We missed the first part of the game because it was so chaotic trying to get in.Do not show up with anything that isn’t a clear bag. They won’t accept backpacks, purses ,etc. put everything in a clear bag.Also, if you are a e-cig user they will ask you to check it in down somewhere at other gate or toss it .We went to our seats and proceeded to watch people get so inebriated it was hard to focus on the game. Why aren’t the people trained selling beers for $17 a can noticing when someone is over the limit? People standing in front of us and then we have to stand because we couldn’t see the game. It was a circus.After the game we stayed till it cleared out since it was a stampede .The game was great and Rams won..I’d rather watch it on TV rather then go thru what the Coliseum had to offer.Disappointed venue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumble-Brig
10,Horrible experience,"Horrible place. Visited for an NFL game last night. Queues were awful getting in but you almost expect that from any sporting event. Prices for drinks and food etc also very expensive but also to be expected. Also make sure you check out the bag rules in advance.When we eventually got in someone was sat in our seat so we couldn’t see the seat numbers. People were telling us to ‘get out the way’. It felt very hostile from the beginning. Asked a steward to help us find our seat who then had to ask the person to move. Someone proceeded to jump down over the chairs next to us and threaten us telling us if we needed someone to move we should have asked them, which we would have done if we knew it was our seat. He got right in my husband’s face asking him if he wanted to fight. We decided to leave after not even 5 minutes of the game. Such a horrible and disappointing experience. Maybe we just got seats in the wrong place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirstyandmatt20
10,Horrible and Expensive,"What a shame that one of my favorite football teams has to play in a dump like this. Where to start? Impossible to get to with the LA traffic and no mass transit. Want to park anywhere near or on the stadium grounds, prepare to shell out $75 to $100 just for parking. Hungry? Good luck getting anything to eat with the lines (although the food choices looked so pathetic, you’re probably better off skipping that). Thirsty? Good luck getting through the lines of foul mouthed drunks to get a $17 can of beer. The stadium is disgustingly dirty.

This is an older stadium with extremely limited parking. It was a hassle trying to figure out where to park, especially since the new soccer stadium is only a block away, and they don't have any parking either.

10,Very unfriendly and very inadequate security.,"They have very unfriendly and very inadequate security. When I with my family mistakenly drove into their driveway, which was not even on a game day, we were stopped at the security checkpoint, and the security officer created quite a fuss. I said OK, what is the big deal? We cannot enter - so, we will turn around and leave. No, they did not allow us to turn around the car, and forced us to back it up instead. When I said I am not comfortable to perform the dangerous backup and prefer to turn the car around, the response was that we are trespassing and police would be called unless we backed up the car. I asked: how turning around at the security checkpoint is trespassing? The response was: oh, but that is our ""policy"", we are just enforcing it, and if you don't agree with the ""policy"" speak to the operations director. Despite the situation being utterly ridiculous, the security manager was utterly convinced that they are doing the right thing - he suggested that this ""policy"" is used all over the US, and expressed a surprise that I am not familiar with it. And so, with 2 little children in the car, I had to perform a dangerous backup through this long and narrow driveway backing into the active street with high-speed traffic, endangering the car, endangering 2 children, endangering my wife and myself. I later reported this incident to the operations director and asked what kind of ""policy"" would dictate that a car cannot turn around at the security checkpoint, and has to backup instead. The operations director seemed surprised too, sincerely apologized for the incident, and promised to speak to the security personnel about ""balancing the site security with safety of visitors"". The operations director took my contact and promised to get back to me to confirm the resolution, but I did not hear from him - so, I am not sure there was any improvement around the ""policy"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9882GYsergeyk

30,NFL Game Saints@Rams,"Went to the Coliseum last November 26th with my brother-in-law to watch the NFL game. I am an ardent Saints fan, my brother-in-law's favorite team is the Seahawks. The Coliseum has (personal) history on its side: This was actually the second NFL game I saw at the Coliseum. In 1991, the Raiders beat the Niners 12-6...Anyways, as a venue, the Coliseum is highly average. It is rather old and the fold-down seats rather creaky, in some spots there is even rust. Also, it is too big and the atmosphere during games is Cali-like mellow, a far cry from the rocking confines of the Superdome in New Orleans or CenturyLink Field in Seattle. However, we enjoyed a gorgeous late-November afternoon, sunny and around 75F. Getting to and from the Coliseum is a hassle, we used Uber to get there and exited half a mile from the stadium because traffic came to a complete stop. After the game, we walked back to Downtown, took us roughly 50 minutes. All in all, it was a nice gameday but if you are not invested in the gig, the Coliseum per se is nothing special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/898markuss

Fortunately for us we were the only people that were there for the tour so Bob was able to offer us a great tour and on top of that he's very good at photography and will take many good photos for us to remember the tour. We were surprised to learn so many historic events that have happened in the Coliseum and Bob was good at providing a story to the events where you can picture them in your mind.Did you know the Coliseum was the first home of the Dodgers when they moved to Los Angeles from Brooklyn? I think Bob said that they played there the first 3 seasons while Dodger Stadium was being built. Also, it hosted 3 different Olympics and the site of the very first Super Bowl even thought it wasn't called that at the time.Bob really took his time showing us many different things about the Coliseum and never made us feel like we were taking too long to take photos or ask questions. He appears to enjoy being a tour guide and wants you to really enjoy the experience of visiting this historic Coliseum and if your a sports fan this should be a ""must see"" and I hope you get Bob as your tour guide.

40,A classic stadium but be careful where you seats are,"Built for the 1932 summer Olympics, the Memorial Coliseum is a great place to take in a football game (ideally a USC match against a rival like UCLA). It gets loud, there's a great selection of food on the lower perimeter of the stadium and the views to the city and mountains in behind from the upper rows are great. Do be careful where you choose your seats. The stadium was designed for track and field, not football, so the views from sections 26-29 and 1-4 aren't great - the far end of the field is a long, long, long away. It's easy to get here taking the Metro Expo line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4232XIjohnb
40,Tips for using MetroRail to USC games at Memorial Coliseum,"LA is a car city, but as an alum that no longer lives there I have finally started using mass transit into the Colliseum for USC games and recommend it, if you learn the basics.First off the definitions: Metro Rail is an urban rail system in Los Angeles. Metrolink is a commuter rail system that brings people into LA and then hooks up to the Metro Rail and Metro Bus. I think that is what confuses people: these terms are NOT interchangeable but completely different forms of transit. If you ask ""how do I catch the metro?"" it doesn't get you far. If you ask ""how do I catch the train?"" you may end up on the way to San Diego. To use the rail system to get to the game you want MetroRail (a combination of light rail and subway).Tap Card: looks like a hotel key card and fares you purchase we be loaded on to it so that when you go through a turnstile at a station you will ""tap"" your card and the fare is electronically deducted. Stations have ""vending"" machines and you will purchase a Tap card and a fare to be loaded onto it. Don't throw the Tap card away, who knows you may get the hang of this faster than I did and hit the town.What rail line to take: Your goal is to catch the Expo Line from the 7th St/Metro Station because from this station you catch the rail line that serves USC/Colliseum. Know exactly where you are coming from and then you can go online or ask your hotel/friends to help you find which Metro Rail line and transfers you need to get to the 7th Street/Metro Station to catch the Expo line to USC. For example, we are in South Pasadena and the closet rail station is Union Station. We can drive/park there, or ride share (uber) to Union Station and take the red line to 7th Street Metro Station and transfer to the Expo Line. Once we tried to bypass Union Station and ride share directly to 7th street/Metro Station. We found that at street level there is no big signage that says ""7th Street Metro Station"", so if you get to 7th and Flower Street, or 660 S Figuero (in the Financial District) you are there. Get out of your taxi, ride share etc and look for people taking escalators DOWN into the station. If you see anyone in a USC team colors just ask them to show you what to do (follow the football gear).Once inside the station look for the big vending machines, you will see lots of people using them to buy a Tap card and fare for the Expo Line. There are also employees and staff available. Feel free to ask for help, they want you to use the Metro system.Once on the Expo Line you can get off at Jefferson St. which is the north end of campus and where the new University Village is. Or continue directly to Exposition Park which is the closest station to the coliseum and is on the south end of campus.Return fare. if you did not book a round trip fare you can purchase one at a small table set up for this just south of the tracks. Do this NOW, not after the game to avoid crowds.After the game: you can do the reverse, but in addition to the light rail back to 7th street they now have Express Buses to help handle the large crowds after the game that need to get to 7thSt/Metro Station to make connections. The buses are faster. Then at 7th/Metro catch the other line you came in on, get a cab or call an Uber.Ride Share at Union Station: Very important that if you want them to pick you up at Union they are supposed to use ""Pick up and Drop off"" which is noted on the building but is underground. As soon as you book your ride, call the driver to make sure they know to come into the underground parking area to get you. This is especially important due to safety if you went to a game that ended after dark or are new to the city. Union Station security will keep an eye out for you. I am not sure of the ride share set up at other stations.Metrorail will cost you about 5.00 or so round trip.Parking in the area of the Coliseum is limited, expensive ($50-150) and real confusing after the game due to road closures directing people out of the neighborhood. You'll rarely go out the way you game in and that can be more time consuming and stressful than learning the Metro system.You can sometimes get an Uber to get you to the game but not out of it (they can't get to you)We use ride share to get to a station and then let rail get us to the campus/Colliseum. And then we use rail to get out of the post game crowds and then call ride share/taxi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackie049
30,Nice and historic but could use some upgrade,"It's a great place to take pictures and watch a football game. However, parts of it is in decay, especially the bench section. I've never been to a professional stadium where there are benches. They are old with peeling paint, and prices are not cheap either. Like any other stadium, food and drink are very expensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5544LOpeterh
50,Favorite place to watch football,"I've been in stadiums all around the USA. This one is just greater - the experience is heightened by the Olympic structure. And there is nothing like the sound of the Trojan Marching Band (saw Utah vs USC). Great game. People were extremely friendly when visiting from Utah, unlike the jerks from South Bend, Indiana who seriously need to get a life - but not everyone can be from USC. Win or lose, nothing compares to being a member of the Trojan family. The sunshine, the cheerleaders, the traditions - a truly complete University and an unparalleled place to watch the great game of football. No wonder the Trojans have more Pac 12 football championships than any other team in the conference. They've been given a magnificent place to Fight On!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfdann
50,Football Fans Delight,We saw USC v. Utah which turned out to be an extremely exciting game. The stadium itself is somewhat outdated but definitely worth experiencing. The area is great for pregame tailgating but a little concerning after dark. Fans were friendly even after we told them we’re visiting from South Bend and are huge Irish fans. All in all it was a great experience to see the host site for the 1988 summer Olympics. The only thing better was when ND stomped them a new mud hole the following weekend. Go Irish!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrish77
40,"Built for Gladiators, I think!",A very different type of stadium than what I'm accustom to. We attended the Rams vs. Seahawks and I'd never seen such a structure for sports with all of the vendors outside of the stadium. Way too hot for me with way too much sun. I like the stadiums that have covers and A/C.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanAnnF
50,Must see Awesome Sports Coliseum!!,"Went to the USC vs Texas football game. Visiting the Coliseum was an experience in itself. Its amazing from the lighting of the flame to the over 90,000 seats to watch a game. The atmosphere is electric. This is an historic venue as it was the site of the 1984 Olympic games. All the seats in the stadium are well situated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rockdoc7
40,Visited for USC vs Texas Game 2017,The stadium is still nice for such an old place. The seats were comfortable. My main complaint is the parking and the dangerous areas surrounding the coliseum (but the LAPD did a good job of having officers on virtually every relevant corner when the game ended and it was dark and spooky).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadtripguyaz
30,NFL football game,"It was strangely awesome to attend an NFL game here as it took me back when I was my sons age and went to the old RFK. It was awesome, felt like a Redskin home game. With all the money and bling it was nice, won’t last but nice. People of LA if you don’t want a team just say so, or show up! They deserve better attendance than you are giving them. The stadium needs a lot of work, no Way is it ada compliant! Good luck Rams!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamoBritt

YOU GOT TO GO!","When you are in los Angeles, especially this time of year, during NCAA Pac 12 college, and Pro football season, YOU NEED TO GO TO A GAME, or take tour.SC is a top ranked PCS team, and the spirit is awesome. Check it out. Fight On!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyFi18
40,Big but drinks expensive,"We went to the Coliseum to watch USC play a college football game. The stadium was massive, much bigger than our UK football stadiums. It was good to visit the home of the 1984 Olympics. We sat very high in the stadium but our view was brilliant due to the stadium design. Our only criticism is that the drinks were expensive in the stadium, $4 for a bottle of water, $5 for a coke and $6 for a lemonade. Alcohol wasn't served. There are water fountains so you can buy a drink and then fill up the container with water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terryc182
50,Chargers vs. Rams,I lived in LA my entire life and it took me 30 years till my first visit to this amazing place. I enjoyed a historic football game here and loved every moment. The place is old and falling apart but its part of the LA charm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
50,Real American high school experience,"Best thing to do on your trip to LA?Whether you like sports or not?1. Buy a ticket to a game of USC Football2. Buy a box of canned beers3. Go to the bookstore on campus and buy a shitload of USC Trojans gear, or not..4. Tailgate with all the students, fans and other football fans on campus and then go with the flow.Make sure you take all day for it and you won't be disappointed.Best experience ever!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BramN_12

50,Take the guided tour. Esp. if you are sports fan...,"You will wonder why....but, after you will take the 2 -21/2 hr tour, you will understand. If you are any type of historian, and esp., sports historian, the stories that are embedded within these walls, are incredible. From the early Olympics in 1932, USC, UCLA football games to concerts.... Bob , hopefully you will get him, your tour guide is sensational.It is a hidden gem, amongst the huge city of LA...easy accessible from public transportation, and located behind the California Science Museum.Thanks Bob.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdrianSly
50,Tour,I really enjoyed the tour from Bob AKA MR COLISEUM this guy was hilarious he did an excellent job I thought it would be boring but he really amazed me,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiesP9854JA
50,Stadium Review,Honestly best tour I have ever had and this is solely due to the amazing tour guide Bob Courtney. Only had a short time in L.A. and visted all the main attractions and this stadium and tour was up there with the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory. Incredible views from the top and amazing insight to USC and Olympic History. Definitely worth the price and trip out there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_o_e1996UCC
40,Old but still functioning Stadium.,"Went to the Real Madrid v Man City game there July 26. Was amazed at the sheer size of the stadium. We had very good seats, but this stadium does lack simple things like cup holders. But then again, that is how 93,098 fit inside. Food options were excellent. Pricing not too bad. Was an awesome experience for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gol1ca
30,Nice historical spot,The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is just west of downtown LA and is easy to get to and offers an interesting spot to enjoy a very historical site which will be home to another Olympic games soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Old but with Soul,Even though it is a pretty old stadium and the facilities could be greatly improved there is no better experience than going to the Coliseum to watch an SC game. Everyone is cheering and it is honestly an amazing experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexBTraveler
40,A must see for a sports fan,"LA Coliseum has history around every corner, it's a great place to visit and since there's such a large number of seats some of the tickets are often on the cheaper side for sporting events. It's located right next to USC which has a beautiful campus and excellent transport facilities, although on hot days it's important to remember there's no shade and on our last visit our section of the stadium ran out of water bottles. Come prepared!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattw17798
50,A GREAT piece of history!,"My tour was conducted by Bob Courtney, aka 'Mr Coliseum' - there is nothing this gentleman does NOT know about this place---and the place is loaded w/ history - Jackie Robinson played football here...The tour includes press-boxes, USC & visiting team's locker rooms and SO much more! The tour is an hour & a half appx & WELL worth the $20!! While not expected, a tip at the tour's conclusion would be well-received...Bob was more that outstanding & questions are welcomed!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatleyk
50,A MUST SEE for any football or track and field fan!!!,The tour led by Mr Coliseum was one of the highlights of our trip to LA! The history of the stadium was amazing and the $25 fee for the 90 minute tour was a bargain for all of the history and knowledge you gained on the tour. You can do a $10 self-guided tour but the guided tour is worth the money. Even if you aren't a sports fan i believe you will thoroughly enjoy all the tour has to offer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/523krish
30,Another place with nothing to do.,"I have always watched games at the LA Coliseum over my fifty one years so thought I might like to drive by and take a closer look as I passed through. There is no museum or anything else to do. They are constructing a new soccer stadium so the area is congested. Glad I went buy but other than taking a selfie, you just move on to the next spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I2099SWpatrickw
30,Interesting place,"I visited the Coliseum on a recent visit to LA. I was on the Metro Expo line and had a spur of the moment decision to check the place out as I had heard about its Olympic history. I went round to the cabin to get a tour ticket, but would have had to wait for more than an hour for the guided tour to start, so I decided to pay $10 for the self-guided tour. This gives you access to a small area containing the memorial plaques and views of the pitch but nothing more. Its a very interesting place, but I think I would recommend paying the $25 for the guided tour if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackhF9660BG
50,Trojans Game,SC vs ND. What a great venue and great game. Nothing like college football. The Sr Salute and half time at an SC game. Arrive early to tailgate and visit remodeled Heritage Hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marksG7602PN
50,Great location,"Love the location because it is in the center of LA. I have been here for 4th of July fireworks, running events, special Olympic opening ceremony and other sporting events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsiona707
20,Guided Tour was Very Good,"Self guided and guided tours available. Self guided tours are $10 between 10am-4pm and ONLY allow you in the Peristyle area including the Court of Honor. Guided tours occur twice daily and last approximately 90 minutes. They explore most of the building starting at the Peristyle and concluding on the field level. Cost of the guided tour is $25.I arrived a little past the departure for the guided tour but Mr. Coliseum caught me up and provided a private 1:1 guided tour for me this winter. I got expert information from Bob as he walked excitedly from plaque to plaque, expressing knowledge about the figures that are memorialized in bronze. Surely I expected figures like Jackie Robinson and Knute Rockne, but I was surprised those in bronze were famous for political and religious purposes as well. Including Billy Graham, Pope John Paul II, JFK & Nelson Mandela. Ironically missing from the Memorial Court of Honor are all 7 Heisman winners from USC Football. Seems odd to me to have plaques of people who were in the building once but not of those who kept the building full.Tip: If you're a big USC fan, know who's giving the tour... Mr. Coliseum is a UCLA grad and will highlight the bruins (there are many) on the wall. Try to keep him on task.A quick walk around the building and then up to the rooftop for the best view of downtown LA from the SW. Tip: Ask about the expansion gaps in the building as you turn the corner. The view from up there is amazing on a clear day. You can see from the Hollywood sign to Long Beach. Wow. Mr. Coliseum was generous to take some pictures for me, what a host.Down the elevator and into the press box. I got to sit in the Athletic Directors seat as if I were him watching the game. Great view from up there. Keep in mind this view will cost A LOT more in the coming month as USC pours millions of dollars into renovations of the press box.Back down the elevator, around the entire lot and down the tunnel we went. We walked into the door the players enter and exit as they prepare for battle. TIP: Tap the FIGHT ON sign on the door frame just like a player would before they hit the field. And into the home locker room... Notice how open and spacious it is. Great wood work, logos everywhere and a nice video. I got to sit in the head coach's chair. If only money came out of the seat and rubbed off on me. The guy who calls this chair his is worth at least $5M / year.Back outside and down into the visitors locker room. It's 3 rows of hell for a visiting team. Not even enough lockers for a full team. My favorite is the support pillar in the way of someone's locker. Good luck visitors.Down the curved tunnel again and... out on the field. If only for one step, field level is still spectacular. Put yourself in the shoes of some of the most incredible athletes to ever play sport. Olympians, Baseball all-stars, titans of the gridiron... it's nerve wracking to imagine 100k people watching your every move.Finally it's up the steps towards the Peristyle and out of the bowl. Tip: count seats as you walk down the isle, they switch in the middle of the row. Also look at the difference in concrete from rows 1-14 and the rest of the bowl. On the first 14 rows, you're standing where the Olympic track was.I'd recommend you do a little reading before your visit, it will make the experience come alive as you wander around and see the Coliseum. From the stones of antiquity to the modern sculpture out front; from the history to the future. This building is potentially the most historic sports venue in America.TIP: if you've got young kids or family that isn't interested in the Coliseum, send them next door to see the NASA Space Shuttle Endeavor (it's FREE).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimballH
30,Ehh.,"We took a tour of the facilities and it was really unorganized. The stadium needs some serious updating and improvements. Also the screen weirdly feels too far away to see. I would not recommend spending money on a tour. However, the only reason I am giving it a 3/5 is because the history of this place is unreal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chloeferg192
50,Awesome stadiun,We watched a Rams game here in December and it was great. The stadium is huge and the atmosphere was very electric.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JasonDoz
50,Stadium Tour was excellent,We didn't pre-book and just turned up and paid our money for a guided tour. It was superb value thanks to our guide Bob (Mr Coliseum). He gave us so many details of the history of the building and the people connected to it. We went all over the stadium; the views from the top overlooking Downtown were amazing. Bob was very happy to take our photos with key features in the background. He was not only informative but was amusing as well. He even gave us tips on other places to visit while we are over from the UK. The 90+ minutes flew by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/127rogers
30,Really Needs Facelift,"We have been here several times over the past 20 years, and almost nothing has changed. LA Memorial Coliseum's historical significance is unmatched. It ashamed that it seems to be eroding away. Parking is ridiculous, concession stands are minuscule and seats are uncomfortable. This stadium deserves to updated, but keep it's Romanesque look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1mohman
50,The tour of the coliseum is highly recommended,"We are local L.A. people who have been to the coliseum for sporting events but have never been on the tour to see the behind the scenes areas of the venue as well as learn about the history and people who have figured into the proud heritage of the site. Bob (Mr. Coliseum) was our guide and was outstanding. He was knowledgeable and humorous. The tour was supposed to be 90 minutes but he spent over two hours with our small group. The cost was $25 as opposed to $10 for self guided. Advice: Take the guided tour as self guided will absolutely be a waste of time and money. Areas visited besides the exterior of the venue were the top of the press box, AD/Owner suite, both locker rooms and the tunnel. We were taken down to the field but not allowed on the field. Bob made sure the tour was informative and moved to all the pertinent areas. He even offered to take photos in various locations. Tickets can be bought ahead of time online but I saw no reason why you couldn't walk up to the tour office (Gate 29) and buy them on the spot. Appreciated the small group numbers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apacheap
40,Rams vs. Cardinals,"Been to this stadium over a dozen times. Okay the stadium is impressive BUT also needs help! It has serious historical history and it truly feel magical when walking in knowing that the Olympic Games were here... and the abundant athletes, and concerts that have taken place there. With all that said it needs a serious face lift! From the speaker system at the games to the ""big screen"", the seat are worn down and yes it's nostalgic but it needs to be replaced! Food stands no existent. Overall historic but needs a serious 500 million to 1 billion in renovation to become a real competitor to the other stadiums nationally and globally... it's Los Angels for goodness sakes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianar386
50,Awesome stadium,"This was my first time visiting the coliseum since the return of the LA Rams. I must say, the stadium has that old feeling. Reminds me of being in Rome. I really like the stadium due to the cardio required. Plenty of steps, good for workouts, bad for intoxicated people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toewing
30,Parking Sucks - Food Choices Limted - Rams Offense weak,"If you are going to the Rams game - Be Prepared. Parking can easily cost you $50+. We parked across the way at USC for an outrageous $50. Regular fans knew to bring a clear, strong plastic bag for their food and drinks. I would highly recommend you take the Metro because of traffic and parking. If you are going to a day game and don't want sit facing the sun the entire game sit on the South side. The offense was a yawner and the play calling was predictable and did not match the strengths of the offense.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryFleishman

Stadium is old and shows it age but food choices outside and on the concourse are decent, the 1984 Olympic stuff was very nice to look at and review -- with the sun, there isn't really any shade in the stadium, so be prepared to cook unless it is a later game (part of the stadium does get shade) -- many stay out of their seats till just before game time to stay out of the direct sun -- huge stadium, lots of history -- worth visiting once...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stormyray

30,Be Prepared!,"Went here October 8 2016 for a Rams/ Bills Football game. First off, NO parking at the venue, it is all pre sold and you must pay ransom pay to park nearby at private lots. Upwards of $60. Then try to enter the venue...NO purses, no bags go check your purse in with them after the LONG line or dump all your stuff in a plastic bag and still leave your purse with them But wait there's more! No tobacco of any sort allowed inside. Mistake #3 don't bring a person that can't be without tobacco! So my other ticket holder refused to go in if no tobacco and NO IN & OUT at all! So there I stand, inside the gates with my $85 ticket alone as my partner decides No tobacco, not going in! I am holding 4 waters, 2 drinks, 2 hot dogs, 2 chips. Show my ticket and I am directed to walk halfway around the stadium to be told ""NO your seat is back at other end"" So there I go again to where I started carrying everything to be told by yet another guide ""NOPE you are at other end"" where I just walked from again! I complain and he decides to walk me back to other destination I left twice before. Still carrying 4 waters, 2 drinks, 2 hot dogs, 2 chips alone and its damn hot and impossible to maneuver thru the crowd who is actually hostile to my Buffalo Bills garb. Made it to my seat in time for half time when I entered 30 minutes before start of game. Ended up going to parking lot at halftime to sit at someones camp and watch the game on their TV powered by generator, in a comfortable recliner with free beer. Only good thing I have to say ids the Bills beat the Rams! .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiAnnesInLove
30,Know the rules ahead of time for NFL games!,"We came for a Rams game. It was my first NFL game so here's some tips for others who might have been in the same boat. You can't bring in bags or backpacks. Most people carry clear 12"" x 12"" NFL branded clear tote bags. Women can bring in a purse the size of their palm, but they are very strict about it. Mine was okay, but my mothers which was just a few inches larger was not. They took it to security and she had to pick it up after the game. There are express lines if you don't have a bag. You can bring in 2 bottles of water but they must be factory sealed. We froze ours the night before, so we had cold water at the game. They had free water re-fill stations (not sure if these are permanent - apparently they had run out of bottled water at the first Rams game). Food is VERY expensive so I advise eating before you arrive. The best value I found there was a hot dog for $6.50. All other hot food was $10 - $15. Lines were long for beer at half time and at some of the food stands, other food stands were okay. Some places were selling water for $7 but we saw it for $5 at others so check around. The rules say no food allowed but we were able to bring in small bags of pop corn, pretzels etc. I saw other people bringing in similar items so I'm guessing the no food rule relates more to hot food or picnic meals. If you arrive early, check all the gates, some open earlier than others. They will allow you to enter the stadium early, but have a set time before you can enter the Coliseum itself. I heard there was problems getting people in on the first game against the Seahawks. They must have ironed out the kinks because we didn't see any long lines of people waiting to get in and the stadium was pretty much full when our game started. To be on the safe side, I'd advise arriving at least an hour before the game starts. We had seats behind the goals in Section 13. There is one big screen which was directly behind us, it was a pain in the neck (literally) as we had to twist our heads around to see it. It would have been better if we sat on the sides or at the other end so we can see the screen more clearly. There is a much smaller screen at the other end of the stadium where the VIP area is, but it's not nearly as clear. The seats are individual, not bench style. I didn't find them uncomfortable. You can't bring in umbrellas and there is no shade anywhere, so wear a big hat and sunscreen if it's hot. I also saw a lot of people wearing caps with towels in the hat that hung over their necks, I think they wet them to keep cool. Wait time at the bathrooms wasn't too bad considering the crowd. We took the Metro and it was great. One tip, make sure you have your return fare loaded on to the card when you arrive at the game. There are long lines at the machines afterwards. Also very long lines to get out of there on Metro, it does move regularly so be patient. We actually went to Starbucks and chilled there for a while until the lines eased up a little. There are lots of warnings that parking is not available. My parents parked at a restaurant opposite the Coliseum for $80 (crazy, I know). I also heard there is parking at USC and I did see $10 parking available a few stops down the Metro line. If you arrive early, you could try that but I imagine it goes fast. The Coliseum itself was clean and it was nice to feel the history there. There was a strong law enforcement presence and Metro employees working which was nice as it's not a great area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canyonmom
30,Football Games,"Cool, vintage, historic venue. Bring Sun screen and a big shade hat of some sort, there are no shaded seats unless you're in a box. Will call was at gate 4 for usc games. Seats are closer together than in modem stadium, the peeps behind you are right on top of you, long legs will put your knees over the person in front of you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/humpdiggity
50,Excellent tour guide,"We had Bob as our tour guide, he would have made a great auctioneer as he talked so fast. Bob brought us water as it was very hot. Bob told us so many stories. If u r a sports buff u would enjoy this tour! We got to go on the field and into the home team locker room. There is so much history in the stadium, i highly recommend this tour and if u get Bob as ur tour guide it will b icing on the cake!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/267dianer
50,Rams Fan Had A Blast,I've been a Rams fan since 1984. I've never had the pleasure of seeing a home game. This was my first time. And I can't tell you how much fun it was. I know the team will have a new high tech stadium in a few years but it was a thrill to see a game here. This place is legendary to me. The views are awesome. The crowd was completely into the game from start to finish. Even sitting up near the scoreboard you didn't feel like you were a hundred miles away like at other stadiums. Hell I got a Coliseum burger and even that was pretty damn good (served on a football shaped bun no less.) I left that stadium that day knowing I'll be back for Rams games as much as I can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Go Rams!,"We saw the Rams vs Seahawks game on Sept. 18th. It was the opening game for the Rams. We were Seahawks fans, but I was so proud of Los Angeles getting a team that I switched sides! Crowds were huge, but friendly. Transportation/parking was no problem for us; we took an Uber. Bring your own water if it's hot, they did run out 3rd Quarter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rchristiansen617
10,Worst sports venue in .... The world,The coliseum is timeless... And the concession lines prove it!!! 45 minutes for a beer and food is unacceptable!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/devonb141
50,fight on!,"saw the Trojans V Utah State Aggies here as my husband loves football .... great venue , fabulous atmosphere, very well organised many many facilities (food / restrooms), and interesting historically too, as the olympics were held here in 1984 ...can even see Daley Thompsons and Seb Coes names on the memorial plaques :D",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonQ144
40,KB,"I have not been to the coliseum for about 20 years. We went to see a Chiefs vs Rams game as my wife is a huge chiefs fan. The only down side is there is no real parking at the venue. USC has 5 parking structures but charge 50.00 to park in them. So we took the new metro line from culver city. Cost for 2 round trip tickets from parking lot to Coliseum was 7 dollars. The train was full of other fans and added to the festivity of the night. The train ride was less than 15 minutes. Coming back we had to wait for one train and we were headed back to our car. The venue is old but getting older myself made me appreciate it even more. The history of it being built in 1921 its almost 100 years old. The seats were comfortable. It was clean and kept up. There are plenty of concession stands but no M and Ms, just peanut. The staff and law enforcement did a great job directing you out of the stadium and to the right trains to get on.It was a great date night with the love of my life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kylebistline

50,Wonderful historic tour,If you get a chance take this tour. I'm not a sports nut and I still found it very interesting.A lot of history and future here. It is mostly outdoors so be prepared for the weather. Hat and sunscreen.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gail19572015
50,USC Coliseum,"This was more of a stop for my husband. However, I must say, it was a very impressive stadium. The staff that sold us our tickets were very helpful, informative, and enthusiastic. We enjoyed the self-guided tour very much. Be advised that there is a 3$ fee to use a debit/credit card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/271danim
40,Good tour of iconic stadium,I understand these tours are quite new but I would recommend. Its good to see the old stadium from the inside. It's showing it's age but an upgrade is pending. Great views of LA from the Press Box roof. The locker rooms are way out of date!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tartan_penguin
40,Great Stadium,Fantastic stadium for an ultimate college football experience! Great views from every seat! What a crowd experience! Can't wait to come back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briani2703
40,Day long event at the stadium,"This is a large stadium, plenty of bathrooms, staff seemed helpful. enough. We were told you weren't allowed to bring in your own food, but we saw people with sandwiches and fruit and all sorts of stuff. Food available at the event we were at was expensive, $10 popcorn, that kind of thing. This is fully outdoors, so if it's forecast to rain, take a raincover!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilovefrance12
50,LA Coliseum..then and Now 2016,"A private tour for friends and colleagues with a guide.Great weather,Sunshine!! and one of the most informative tours I've had!! Our guide was a fountain of information who clearly loved the place and her role there.Her past employ on Disney cruises and in theater surely helped.The Rams, USC teams and hopefully the 2024 Olympics will all play there in the future..PS Lunch at Morton FIg on campus was 4 Stars!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucem107

50,The Call Azusa!,Great Venue! Largest stadium I have ever been to attending The Call Azusa from Jamaica. Have a plastic poncho/ rain coat ready or be prepared to get wet if it rains (they dont allow umbrellas). Pack light. Parking is limited so avoid driving if possible. I enjoyed and appreciated the food options and security generally were couteous and helpful. Would definitely go back for future events and recommend it if hosting a large scale event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whittyjamaican
50,Azusa Now!,The security here was great. The coliseum was huge what a great experience. Parking was full so we parked in someones yard! Lots of yummy food to choose from!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/773ron
30,"""The Call"" at the Coliseum","Attended Lou Engle's ""The Call"" at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on April 9 2016. The Event was an outstanding but the arena itself has some issues. The Coliseum is an outstanding historical site, as it has hosted the 1932 Olympics, unfortunately it needs many repairs. The concrete stairs need replaced. The seating cramped, rusted and very inconvenient if you are seated midway between stairs.** Sit under the Press box (section 6-7) to avoid the sun in the afternoon sun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4888OJdanielb
40,Bit small but great venue,"My best friend and i went here for a concert, it was a great time. It was a bit smaller than i expected but the seats were super easy to find and we had a great view of the concert. There was alot of parking and it was easy to find. The staff was very helpful and made sure all the fans were safe. I had a great time and i would probably attend more concerts there in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyt238
20,Not worth it,"The self guided tour is not worth the price, (however the guided might be, we didn't do it). We expected it or include some sort of audio device or pamphlet with information or something of the sort. Instead you stay at the top of the stadium, and can't even enter the main section of the stadium, you just look at some plaques. If you're not going to take the guided tour, you might as well just walk by the outside of the fence, not pay the $10, and get the same experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
30,The dump that jumps,Went to see Bruce Springsteen perform here and the last concert was also the last days for the venue before it was being demolished. As such the place went off and what a way to finish. We had seat further back from stage but you didn't feel that far away. It definietly was the dump that jumps!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rykony
50,Los Angeles Coliseum Historic Tour,"We had a fun filled very informative tour of the LA Coliseum. It is amazing to learn of all of the major events that have been held there from tow Olympics, World Series, Super Bowls, College football and Pro football. The tour included the press box, coaches box, roof of the press box where the view is spectacular, the dressing rooms and the field. The tour guide was exceptional. I have been going there since 1946 and learned so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/386dickr
50,Fantastic Experience,"We took the 10:30 am guided tour. Bob was our tour guide. He is a walking encyclopedia and not just about the LA Coliseum but about history in general. If it wasn't for Bob, it would almost be another building with a bunch of plaques and steel and concrete however Bob makes history and the events which occurred at the Coliseum come alive. He knows the who, what, and when of major historical events which occurred at the Coliseum and early LA/Calif. history leading up to the building of the Coliseum. He is fascinating to listen to and he weaves in movies and poignant stories about the historical figures which are connected to the Coliseum from religious figures who have appeared at the Coliseum like the Pope and Billy Graham to the major league sports teams and universities which used the venue as their home stadium like the LA Rams, Raiders, Dodgers, UCLA Bruins and of course, USC Trojans. The Coliseum was the host of two world Olympics and countless concerts. It was a 90 minute tour however Bob ran over which was great - we could have stayed and listened for hours more as Bob had so much interesting information to share. You can also take a self-guided tour however I am not sure why anyone would want to do that unless it was due to schedule issues. The Coliseum is right next to USC and several excellent LA County museums so a family can make a day of it at this site. There is a Metro Link train that goes near this site and inside one of the near-by museums you can get something to eat. Bring water and a camera and wear comfortable walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BusyInTorrance
40,Quick tour and history from the top of the stadium,We were walking around the stadium when we were invited in and given a talk about the history of major events and future development ideas. Interesting to see the plaques and stones from other Olympic Stadiums. Thank you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelrN4317AB
40,Historic Giant Arena ...,"I've been coming to the LA Coliseum since before the 1984 Olympic Games and have enjoyed many USC games in the venue. It's dated but functional and is OK except for the problem of inadequate women's rest rooms. Fun to visit & relive the glory games of all that's happened here. LA Special Olympics were well done. Parking is insane, use the Metro! Has overpriced food & drinks, but this is the norm in such venues. Worth a quickie visit. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Nice to see from the outside,"The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was the site of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympic Games. The stadium has been in continual use for professional and high school sporting events, as well as other functions. I asked if there was a museum we could go in and visit to see any artifacts of the Olympics, and was told there was a walking tour of the stadium, but not an actual museum. Would've liked to see something more than a plaque on the wall about the events which took place here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471davem
40,Park at Staples Center and take the train to the Coliseum,Saw a USC game. Nice historic stadium. Took the advice of another reviewer and parked at the Staples Center for $15 and took the train for $3.50 round trip to/from the Coliseum. Avoided all parking and traffic hassles and was right next door to L.A. Live after the game to get drinks and food.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461barbt
30,Take metro expo line here,I come here for usc football games and when i attend have been using the metro expo line to get here. You can get off at the usc/exposition stop and its a short walk to the stadium. The venue itself has bench seatings for large portions i suggest you get a cushion becuz it can get uncomfortable sitting on wood benches with no backing but there are rentals available. As for food options its cheaper on the outside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
50,See a treasured landmark in Los Angeles,"This stadium has hosted two Super Bowls, a World Series, and two Summer Olympics and is loaded with history. This stadium hosts the University Of Southern California Trojans football team, college footballs premier team with the most successful of any school. The field is usually in very good condition and well manicured. The building itself is very old and dated and it is located in a very rough section of Los Angeles. It is however a very safe place on game day as there are several hundred security and LAPD police officers present to keep the place safe. There is plenty of food and drink for everyone. Pick up sausage or two from one of the street vendors they are very good",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancinmofo
50,Awesome!,"Yes, this is the middle of a not so nice area. However, there are cops EVERYWHERE! I sat in field club so my food and beer was provided as a part of the ticket. I loved this historic venue. I loved sitting near USC's band. Simply awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Princerman
50,Incredibly entertaining and informative!,"We've attended many football games and a couple of Olympic events at this stadium during the last 35 years or so, and we had never gotten to see the areas of the stadium or learn so much history as we did from this 1 1/2 hr. guided tour. The tours have only been running for about six months, and I don't think many people know about this fabulous opportunity yet. Our guide was extremely knowledgable and interesting. People who like historical buildings and sports history will especially enjoy this. The tour starts at the peristyle (torch) end of the Coliseum, and the guide tells the stories behind some of the many plaques at that location. Football fans will enjoy the behind-the-scenes area where USC entertains prospects and their parents during games. Next we walked over to the Press Box area, and were able to go on the roof above for a 360 degree view of LA. We also went into the Press Box, and then back down to the tunnel area and locker rooms. We went into both the USC and visiting locker rooms, and were told some great stories by our guide. We walked back to the torch end of the Coliseum at ground level, and got some great photo ops everywhere we went. Highly, highly recommend! There is a self-guided version of this tour for slightly cheaper, but the information and access to various areas is not the same.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SB1114
40,Large Capable Stadium,"We went here or the Special Olympics opening ceremony and it seemed close to capacity. The seats were normal stadium seating and the view of the stage at one end good. Facilities such as bathrooms, concessions etc were all normal and as expected. I gave it a very good for its ability to handle a very large crowd but it could be three stars if you assert that all stadiums should be able to do that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V7533OBstephenc
10,USC has No Security Staff for Special Olympics World Games,"What a nightmare. USC, which now owns the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, was responsible for Event Operations. Not only were there not enough gates open, not only were there not enough Security Staff checking bags and running people through metal detectors, the Security Staff did not check the bags! That's right, I could have had a gun or explosives in my purse, and all they did was have me go through the metal detector, Security Staff never opened any bags, they just slid them along the table. So, lines were incredibly long, and I did not feel safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjskns
40,Special Olympics WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!,Easy access from downtown 7th and flower st metro station please don't be walking from staples center to usc and the ColiseumTake the light blue expo train from 7th St metro station as soon as train turns onto exposition the train will call out the stop walk about 5 min. And you are there also u can use the Metro 81 bus line will take you there also next to USC the Science Center Dead Sea Scrolls many things to do around there the area south of the Coliseum is a bit dodgy so please stay within the Coliseum areaThetransportationgeneral.comWill give you free transit info if u need more help good luck,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertcV6096TO
50,USC Football,"I flew in the LA on a Friday and on the Saturday was USC homecoming. Huge crowd and nice old historical stadium. People were friendly and helpful . Found our seat easy and had a great view. This is a must do it when in LA. It's in a ""Dodgey"" Area but I saw no sign of it being dangerous and felt very safe on the walk back to my hotel",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasonsM8051BW
30,Stop by and take a look at the structure,"I did not realize how close the Coliseum was to the Science Center (one long block away). The gates were closed, as there was no event scheduled. I remember the Oakland Raiders moving to LA and playing football here for twelve years. And in 1984, the Summer Olympics were held here. So many glorious memories here and many more to come. I did not take the tour but it appeared to be informative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flounderm
50,Historic stadium and is the only one left standing that has hosted two Olympic games! 1932 and 1984! Parking tips,Spent some of my childhood going to Raiders games at the Coliseum and was happy to take my family to see Ecuador play Mexico in a friendly soccer game. If you're planning on seeing a sold out game at the Coliseum you must prepare for a parking nightmare. My strategy worked out perfect and I highly recommend it to anyone going to a large event. We parked next to Staples Center and took the expo line train that drops you off right outside the stadium. It works out to be the same price and it saves you the headache of parking at the Coliseum. LA Live is about 2 miles north of the stadium so parking was $10 and round trip train tickets for 5 people was $15. Trains run every 10 minutes and you will still be happy when the day is over. The stadium is epic and takes you back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lumerian
40,Great stop,"The olympic statues and logos, bricks from Rome and Athens, and USC what more can you ask for from a stadium without a game going on",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeT237
10,Unorganized and Unsafe,"I visited the coliseum for a soccer match on March 28.The place got sold out so I decide to go 6 hours early.The entrance was unorganized and Unsafe. No sense where the line started or ended, no one to advise you were to enter or line out. To make the story short I enter the place without been pad down and during half time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erasmo1215
50,Visiting outside of an event,"We visited outside of a scheduled event just to have a quick look around on our way past and discovered that there are $10 per person tours available which are well worth the money! Sherrie and Bob the tour guides were fantastic, providing a wealth of fascinating historical facts and information which added so much to our visit here! Definitely worth visiting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abi375
50,Tyler the Creator!,"I am a huge fan of Tyler the creator and he throws a Carnival every year at the Coliseum, I was so close and so happy and will continue to go! the Coliseum is huge and a super cool place to have any type of event!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/533janineh
40,Wow!,"As a visitor from Australia watching a USC football game... huge crowd - over 75k people, Atmosphere was electric.. like nothing I have seen before at home. We got field suite tickets - worth the extra $$. Great view, infront of the band and included food and drink.. a great venue!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bekky_lee
10,Worst Place to See a Football Game in the Pac 12,"They make you put a 1. That's a complete over rate of this facility. I've been to all the stadiums in the Pac12 - This is the absolute worst. They shove the field to one side of the giant stadium. You might as well stay at home, you're so far from most of the field - particularly if you make the mistake of buying visitor seating. You can't see anything. You check the rules on the size of the back pack they allow you to bring in and its a lie. The won't let you bring in backpacks unless they're those thin nylon things with a draw strap and no pockets, regardless of the size they post on their website. I will not return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pba1
50,very nice.,The view of the stage was great. Lack of instructions by the venue for using the arena on where to line up for entering for seating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shortdlee
40,Historic Stadium - Still Fun to see Football There,"I have gone to several sporting events at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Memorial Coliseum is a huge coliseum by University of Southern California (USC). It seats over 100,000 spectators.The coliseum has hosted the Olympics twice - the first time in 1932 and the last time in 1984. It has hosted Super Bowls and baseball World Series.Now when we go its mostly to watch a USC football game. The seating is relatively comfortable.The coliseum itself is an interesting architectural structure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
30,"Huge historic place, but Driving and Parking Nightmare!","<The Good>1. It is a huge historic place that can hold around 100,000 people.2. Accessible by public transportations.(Best bet is using Metro Expo Line)<The Bad>1. The stadium has a very stiff slope.(It is even dangerous to go to the restroom by going up and down the stairs )2. The sections are not clearly marked.(It is confusing.)3. The parking fee is $25.4. It was windy and cold at night.<The Ugly>1. Driving to a major event causes traffic nightmare in Vermont Avenue.2. Getting in and out of the parking lot is another nightmare.3, Everything is expensive inside.<My recommendation>1. Use public transportation if you can. ex) Metro Expo Line2. If you bring your car, use Western Avenue instead of Vermont Avenue andmake a turn on Exposition Blvd, make a left turn on Vermont Avenue,park your car on the street in front of USC, pay $2~3 instead of $25,and walk 5 minutes to the Coliseum.3. Wear warmer than you think you have to, or bring a blanket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TedH24
50,Go for the atmosphere,"We don't have gridiron in Australia so seeing this was an absolutely incredible experience. If you can get to a Trojans game I highly recommend it purely for the atmosphere alone. They sure do take their college football seriously in America! Yes, there were even planes with colourful smoke to kick off the game. I recommend buying a Trojans t-shirt though or they will know you are a tourist haha (as you can see from my photo EVERYONE wears USC merch). We managed to make some friends in the seats beside us who helped us understand what was going on and happily hi-fived us when something good happened. Yes there was overpriced food, long lines and plenty of cheering but at a stadium like this it is to be expected and a small price to pay for an experience I probably won't have again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshH1611
40,Nice building,"Even there is no function or match at the time I was visiting it, the building is fantastic. It made me keep shooting photos for it. I love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/citytraveldreamer
30,Go for the Halftime show,"I have not been to the Coliseum in many years, and it was much the same. Bad seats, bad view, bad acoustics, bad food. But, the halftime shows were excellent. The only way you are going to see the whole show is if you go to the stadium and watch it. Die hard fans of any kind would no doubt love it. But, you get a better view from the comfort of your own couch or local pub. We used the Metro Link to get there, so that was pretty good. That is really the way to go because parking is just as bad now, as it was when I was there many years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylongyournotalone
30,Soccer Game,I enjoyed watching the soccer game of Costa Rica Vs Korea. The place was a little too old and everything was way over priced! Churro for $5.00 really? Or am I just cheap? Lemonade $ 6.00 that tated more like water with sugar!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taniam539
50,USC Trojans home football game,"This was our first time to a football game, it was a middle of the day game and boy it was Hot, but the atmosphere and game was excellent, not as much merchandise available as I would have thought but still bought stuff, what a wonderful place to visit, parking was another adventure, we ended up paying someone to park on the side walk, but it all made for the whole experience, we bought our tickets from StubHub before we left Australia, and we had no problems, just be careful of the bag size you take with you, we had to take a backpack back to the car, the outside atmosphere is great and to be seen also, not sure what time fans arrive but they have full on BBQ's and beers before the game as no alcohol is sold at the game, it was so much fun, Our seats were right behind the goals, great position.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KylieToole
50,USC Trojans games are FANTASTIC!,"Have season seats for the USC Trojans and love going to the home games. The Coliseum is old and classic, but historic and fun when it is full of Trojan fans. Have to eat a good bacon wrapped hot dog from the street vendors ($4) before you go into the game and walk through the Rose Garden before or after the game. Tailgates are abundant and Trojan Pride fills the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/469bentonl
30,"No tours, a shame","We've been to a number of previous Olympic stadiums, the majority of which provide access to stadium surrounds and seating areas, several have behind the scenes tours. There is no public access to LA Memorial Coliseum these days except on game days. However, we got lucky on a weekend when maintenance staff allowed us in and stayed with us while we took photos of the arena and stands. We were told that through the week if you ring the buzzer at left hand gate, the receptionist may also allow you access to take some internal photos but this is not advertised nor guaranteed. If you can't get past the security fence it is a bit of a waste of time. Sure you'll get some external shots and a small feel for the place but to get a real appreciation of what it must have been like you need to get inside. Parking (which is there for the nearby Natural History Museum, itself worth a visit) will cost you at least $10 depending on day you go . Also the surrounding park and gardens is good for a pleasant stroll.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emanpee
50,Yes Outstanding!!,I so remember watching the Olympics and other sporting events on television and to see it in person WOW!!! Every person I came in contact was like... so FRIENDLY and not like I was sitting there wondering this and that. Thanks to all that helped me get a GREAT impression of LA!!! I WILL BE BACK!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JiminFlorida33460
40,"Great football games, bad surroundings","I've been here three times to see Notre Dame play USC. The stadium is very loud and as a visiting fan, it's very easy to get around. Plenty of food vendors and the stadium staff isn't too strict on assigned seats if you're in an area with empty seats. A few times we've moved over a few sections to empty seats and they never sent us back.Each time we've taken a bus with a group to the stadium, which is good for out-of-towners. The area around the Coliseum was likely where Menace 2 Society and Boyz N The Hood was filmed. You don't want to walk away from the stadium and stay in groups. It's hard for buses to move around after the game with so many fans trying to leave, so expect a wait if you go with a group. Next time we go rather than take the charter bus, we'll probably go early, pay the $100 parking across the street from the stadium, tailgate, and be able to get out quickly after the game.I'm sure other game day experiences here are fun if USC is playing another rival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingBrianandKim
40,Perfectly located right by USC but seating is old and dated,"I recently attended the USC-Arizona State football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It had been decades since I had entered the venue, in fact I believe my last lime was in the mid-1970's for a Monday night game between the then Los Angeles Rams and Washington Redskins. While I found the grounds updated and nice, the seats have pretty much stayed the same; hard and uncomfortable. We sat in the corner of the Coliseum on hard benches. Even the areas that had individual seats were old, hard plastic. Definitely bring a seat cushion with you.However I will say this; even though the seats were uncomfortable the view of the game was still awesome. There appears not to be a bad seat in the house in respects to viewing the game. We were pretty high up but had a great perspective.One thing that definitely has not changed is the traffic, both foot and motor. It is horrible once the game is over. Unless the game is exciting and close (this one was pretty much decided at the end of the third quarter) I would suggest leaving early. Otherwise it could take you 30 minutes just to get to your car, then another hour to get out of the surrounding area. One nice thing though is Metro has a station right at the Coliseum so feel free to take the train to the game. It will probably be a better choice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArchieMYL
40,Awesome Place to attend a USC Gane,Very special sports venue. The grounds are beautiful. Tailgate parties all over the campus. Yhe coliseum has plenty of food selection and plenty of bathrooms. Well organized facility with plenty od staff to get the day going. Very safe. Best places to park are from the locals that live around the area. They will watch you car for $20. Love to go there and take the kids. Very kid friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenaM273
40,history and history in the making,"It was great to attend a USC game at this historic sporting venue. How else can you say that you attended a college football game with 93,000 people where 2 Olympics, a world series and the Super Bowl have been held? It is an old venue, but it was a great experience. It was well staffed, but be prepared to deal with the crowds at large events. I would highly recommend utilizing public transportation so you don't have to deal with traffic, driving around to find a space and paying $30 to park. We rode the rail ($1.50 one way I believe/$5 for a day pass) and it was a breeze (especially with the new Expo line)! They even had event staff at all of the stops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaD888
50,Two-time Historical Olympics Venue with Historical Architecture,"While the NFL appears to shun this Historical and Architectural Stadium, it nevertheless hosted the 1932 and the 1984 Olympics Track and Field Events. The east end of the Stadium is the section that one most commonly sees in photographs, both inside and outside the Stadium. It is worth visiting if only for its historical relevance or its architecture. I think the best photographs can be taken from outside the the east end of the stadium, facing west. One can capture the Peristyle and/or the two torso statues of man and woman from this vantage point.Since I have lived in L.A. most of my life, The Coliseum has special significance to me. I have attended football games played by The Rams, The Raiders, UCLA and even USC (when they played UCLA) at The Coliseum. I attended Dodger Baseball games when the Dodgers first moved to Los Angeles from Brooklyn. As a child, I have attended Rodeos and Fireworks displays here. For years I attended The Coliseum Relays Track Meet. I have also attended the event to welcome Nelson Mandela to Los Angeles while he was touring the U.S.I'm hoping that USC who now manages this Historical Stadium will be able to reverse the damage that years of inept and corrupt management by The Coliseum Commission and its governing body has inflicted on this historical stadium.The Los Angeles Memorial Colisum is worth a visit for anyone coming to Los Angeles for the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgmeigs
30,"Great Concert, okay venue","The Memorial Coliseum is frequently used for concerts. We recently attended Roger Waters ""The Wall"" concert, which was amazing. However, the Coliseum was another story.Security pat downs are required to enter. They confiscated our unopened bottles of water, and other peoples drinks, but randomly let through people with reusable bottles (even though the security person in our line said that wasn't allowed).Ticketmaster did not indicate that our seats were in an obstructed viewing area (as in no view of the stage at all!). When we reached our section, we lucked out and found a security person waiting there to relocate us to another section (closer and better seats). Other people weren't so lucky. They were seated in obstructed view sections and had to ask to be moved. As concert time got closer, confusion reigned supreme as lines of people were redirected to other sections to be assigned new seats (many got far worse seats than they had paid for). Because of this the concert was late getting started. There was insufficient staff to handle the amount of people who needed to be reseated.Food and drink is horribly overpriced, $6 for a bottle of water, $8 or more for other drinks. There isn't anything below $5, not even pretzels or popcorn. With $25 for parking and poor staff training, I'd be reluctant to go to the Coliseum again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MethosAdventures
50,Historic stadium Olympics and USC football,"A must see for anyone who is a sportsman. The 100,000 seat stadium is home to the USC Trojan football team, Rolling Stones concerts, the first Dodgers baseball game played in LA, motocross, rave concerts, Brazil v. Mexico soccer, Olympic track and field and other major events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamakanuiahailono
50,Great Stadium!,"The best stadium in the area! The seats are actually comfortable! I appreciate the many restrooms in the Coliseum, one never has to wander too far to find one. And during USC games, the Coliseum has the best food vendors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BThomas2218

50,Great Experience LA Coliseum,"Huge atmosphere at the college football game UCLA vs USC. Very friendly security guy explained about the car park BBQs. The whole thing was just amazing and our 2 boys just loved it - the bands, the game, the cheerleaders, the food stalls.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/65Sharon
40,Great college football experience,"If 92,000 cheering college football fans, the 'SC band and a crisp California day doesn't get your heart racing, then you need to see a doctor.College football in the LA Coliseum is an experience not to be missed.Unfortunately, you have to fight LA traffic and parking as part of the experience (which is why 4 stars instead of 5).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgtravles
50,Home of the Olympics,"Steeped in history, the Coliseum has been the home of two summer olympics, most recently in 1984. Bare bones and utilitarian, but easy to access and great game day atmosphere for the USC Trojans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhengzhou
