50,Women‚Äôs beach camp,"We organized a beach camp with 8 girls and flew from San Francisco for a long weekend. Mark and Brandon were our coaches and did an incredible job. They tailored every practice and they adjusted the drills based on what we told them or just looking at areas of development. We are a solid group, we practice twice a week but we learned so much in just 10 hours. We will be back! Thank you Beach camp Hermosa",Giulia P
50,Worth traveling across the country for these classes!,"Mark is an amazing player and coach. He runs a tight ship and hires quality players/coaches who know their stuff and are great teachers. The classes have a fun and positive vibe. Every minute is packed with valuable takeaways that continue to improve my game with every practice. I travel from Chicago just to take his classes and private lessons, and it‚Äôs worth the trip every time. Love VCH for helping me get better at beach!",Jane R
50,Taking Your Game To The Next Level,"If you really want to excel fast and take your beach volleyball game to the next level, this is the place to be! Group classes are challenging and informative but privates are the way to go. Every hour you gain so much clarity on things you were doing wrong and how the game is meant to be played tactically. Mark and the other coaches are pro players, currently playing AVP and FIVB matches, so they obviously know the game inside out. Not only that, they've been coaching and analyzing the game for so many years, that they can easily communicate what needs to be done for newcomers to the game. The ability to break down a complex idea or process and have a player understand and adopt it easily is a true skill that they possess.I'm also super impressed with the seamless process of booking privates. You can see each coach's calendar online and book a class accordingly. You get a confirmation right away. Then your coach will call or text you beforehand to get to know more about you (skill level, things you want to work on, etc).",Christopher O
50,Classes like non other,I am a New Jersey beach volleyball player that always wants to better myself whether its working on my footwork or learning how to better my swing. With that said I flew out to California for two weeks to attend VolleyCamp Hermosa. The classes may not seem too long but I can assure after two morning 45 minute sessions my teammates and I are always out of breath from all the hard work we are encouraged to put in. The coaches provide a ton of insight on each players game and really tries to bring out the best in each and every one. If I had to give some advise to anybody that wants to get something out of this class I would say to come in to the class with a goal. All of these coaches are so personable and encourage people to let them know what kind of goals they have in order for them to help point out and better your volleyball game.,marcusurrutia
50,Well exceeded my expectations,I've had a few friends previously go to VolleyCamp and had a great time. Based on their experience I knew this was something I wanted to do. I took four classes and learned a lot! I also had a great time hanging out with Mark and Brandon outside of class. So glad I finally did this and I'm looking forward to going again!,Mike L
50,Best Beach Volleyball Classes and Instructors,Instructors take the time to coach and listen. World class athletes who know their field. Unlike any other volleyball coaching or class I have ever taken.,Daniel N
50,Absolutely great class!!!,"Absolutely great class. I've attended several classes and can guarantee you that this is so far the best experience I've had. Mark Burik is a great teacher. Attentive to details, passionate about sport and pushes you to the limits. Every time I attend I feel wonderful, energetic and enthusiastic. My skills improved dramatically. I wish we've practiced more attack/spike techniques because that's where my weakness is, but hopefully we are getting in to it soon. Highly recommend!!!",Mike S
50,‚ÄúHappy in Hermosa‚Äù,"Hey, I‚Äôm 57 and still want to enjoy every aspect of Hermosa. I live close by and for years I‚Äôve wanted to try a volleyball class ; but have always felt that I wouldn‚Äôt be at a physical level to fully enjoy it. To my surprise, I not only enjoyed but met some lovely people! Young & up to my age , it was a challenge & I learnt a great deal in only 6 weeks. While I admit with my busy life , and my traveling I haven‚Äôt continued this class. I would definitely do this again and hope to next season! Kudos to everyone who‚Äôs up for the challenge!",gina Shakti
50,Great training!,I like it because its a place for players who REALLY want to improve... with coaches who can get you to the next level no matter where you are starting from,Mark B
50,Love it,"I love going to the beach. That group is so much fun. I have been taking multiple volleyball classes and they make me so much better. I highly recommend this, Especially if you want to meet new people. Hermosa beach is a great place.",masha1810
50,Great way to improve your game at any level,Whats so great about these classes is that you get to learn so much about the game from a variety of different coaches. While I was there on vacation I got to learn from six different coaches that all had so much knowledge on the game that came up with different tips and techniques to improve your game.,marcusurrutia
50,Amazing time learning to take volleyball to the next level,"Trained with Mark with a friend while visiting Hermosa. He broke the game down to the basics. It was an intense workout. We heavily focused on passing and setting. Mark gave live feedback, which allowed us to start fixing right away. If you enjoy playing volleyball, then this is a must do!",Aaron T
50,Amazing volleyball training,"I had a fantastic time at VolleyCamp Hermosa. I primarily trained with Mark and Kerri, who are excellent coaches. The training sessions were really technical, so there was a lot of focus on the small details that make a big impact on your game. They are also just awesome people, so the training sessions were really fun and motivating. I did sessions every day for a week, and they followed a logical progression to address most aspects of gameplay. It was a really technical, well rounded week of training.Hermosa beach itself is also gorgeous, and there is all kinds of fun food and shopping around the area. This was an amazing trip, and I will definitely be going back.",Roopa S
50,Great way to learn/improve on the game,"The classes were exactly as described and the coaches were not only excellent but good people! We loved each class and took away something from all of them to improve our game. We also, most importantly, created memories and connections! Worth a try if you enjoy the game and want to improve yoursüèêüôå!",sywchiro
50,"VolleyCamp Hermosa = Fun, Fitness & Massive Improvement at Beach Volleyball (a ""must do"" SoCal experience)","Do you love beach volleyball? Or have some indoor VB experience and always considered getting out on the sand but did not know where to start? Or maybe have little or no VB background but have strolled/biked/skateboarded/rollerbladed/cross country skied down the Strand, past scores of happy people playing games under the Southern California sun and thought, man that looks like a blast, but were too intimidated to give it a shot. Well, VolleyCamp Hermosa is for all of you -- a gateway to fun, fitness, meeting new people, becoming a better vball player and a killer tan (sunscreen optional).This review is a little long because (1) I am huge fan of what Mark and his team are doing (and as a regular weekly VCH attendee for over a year now, probably know as much as anyone what it entails) and (2) VCH actually offers a number of different things to help you down the beach volleyball path depending on what you are looking to do. By way of background, I have played off and on for 20 years, albeit with some extended periods in there where I was unable to play at all (most of that time just winging it with no classes or coaching). After about 8 years away from the sport, I started playing consistently again four years ago, and this time around sought out classes, stumbling into the VCH orbit over a year ago. Without a doubt, this past year has resulted in the most improvement in my game, probably exceeding all prior years combined (it‚Äôs all about the gains, bro), just knowing what to do, where to be and how to execute it (to the point that I am now playing tournaments, which I had never really considered before).In short, VCH is a resource to get better at beach volleyball for people of all ages and levels of play. Classes are available pretty much every day of the week (sometimes twice per day, mornings and afternoons/evenings), taught by professional volleyball players who are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the current game and how to teach it to others. If you are not sure where you fit in based on your skill level or experience, they can point you to the best starting point among their offerings.Beyond the daily classes (the current schedule is always on the VCH website), they offer private lessons for individuals or groups (including kids), and finally video review for those who cannot make it here in person (itself a very valuable resource ‚Äì as just one example, I developed a hitch in my hand setting that was frustrating me to no end for a couple of months, which we were able to catch and fix almost immediately based on video review of one practice).For roughly the same cost as a typical gym membership or fitness/ yoga class, you can get in shape on the beach learning/perfecting a game that can provide life-long enjoyment.Locals/ Southern California Residents:So what are you waiting for? You love beach volleyball and have this awesome resource at your fingertips, which beach players around the world would kill to have access to on a daily basis. Yea I know, its beach volleyball, it‚Äôs supposed to be fun and a little workout to boot, so who needs coaching and classes? And besides, you already learned everything you need to know playing with cousin Charlie down at 33rd Street, including your patented backhand iguana snap cut that 60% of the time, works every time. Well, what if the game has changed since cousin Charlie perfected his craft back in the 1970s (side out scoring and big court represent!). And the hundreds of thousands of weekend warrior tennis players, golfers, cross fitters and yoga enthusiasts who rely on instructors, personal trainers, coaches, etc., would disagree. You know, the whole 10,000 hours thing (it doesn‚Äôt work if you spend all of that time doing it wrong)? A couple of hours of coaching per week, learning the right way to do things, can pay big dividends, whether in bragging rights with your local crew, tournament play (getting that next rating), or just your personal quest to see how much you can improve.It‚Äôs also a sneaky way to stay in shape. If you are procrastinating over going to the gym, getting on that exercise bike/elliptical or heading out for a run, what could be easier than heading down to the beach, popping off your shoes and ‚Äúworking out‚Äù with a bunch of guys and gals, with music and the ocean as your soundtrack (bonus points that you can also taunt all your old pals from the winter regions or old country with Instagram and Facebook posts about your fabulous beach lifestyle).And to underscore, this is an intensive workout. While each class has a particular technical skill set that is the focus (which you can see on the schedule on the VCH web site) and different classes can be aimed at different levels of play, it‚Äôs all wrapped in fast pace drills and mini-games. You will get a lot of touches, there won‚Äôt be a lot of standing around waiting and at the end you will feel like you have been put through a real workout (most times equivalent to the burn of interval or circuit training, plus the core work that volleyball involves).Visitors to LA/Southern California:For you visitors, just ignore that bit above about taunting you guys with photos of our daily beach existence (it‚Äôs said with love), or feel free to dish it out to your buddies back home while you are out here! Put on your flip flops and sunglasses and come on down (after you stop by that screening of ‚ÄúThe Price Is Right‚Äù).As a traveler, I have always appreciated TripAdvisor reviews to help decide what to do and where to go on our various family trips, but generally never felt I had any special knowledge to offer in a review myself, this being the one exception.Heading to Maui? You of course find the best surf lessons, snorkel/fishing trips, hikes or zip lines.Banff? Trips to the ice field, lakes and ski resorts.Hermosa Beach/Manhattan Beach? Well, the four miles of beach from South Hermosa to North Manhattan probably has more people playing beach volleyball on a daily basis than any place in the world, among them current pros, past legends, visiting foreign national team members, as well as hundreds of average Joes and Janes playing 2‚Äôs, 3‚Äôs, 6‚Äôs and everything in between, as well as tournaments of every stripe throughout most of the year (including the venerable AVP Manhattan Open).As far as I know, VCH offers the only classes readily available to out of town visitors/vacationers. While there are some other local resources in Southern California, those classes are usually offered on month plus long sessions and so are aimed at locals. And none have the number of classes per week offered by VCH or the ability to sign up for classes one by one (rather for a series of classes) with little advanced notice.So for all you visitors to Southern California, sure go see Hollywood, Santa Monica, Disneyland and all the rest, but if you have a volleyball bone in your body, you have to come down to Hermosa and jump into a VCH class or three and get a little coaching from professional volleyball players. Or for the more serious, come stay in Hermosa for a week of intensive daily training (followed by some Hermosa nightlife ‚Äì you might even be able to catch one of Jay Leno‚Äôs semi-regular Sunday night stand-up appearances at the intimate Hermosa Comedy and Magic Club).Juniors:With the explosion of our sport at the junior level, what better gift can you give your volleyball junkie kid than some beach lessons with professional volleyball players? That‚Äôs not something readily available to their football/basketball/baseball peers. As a parent of a junior indoor club level volleyball player, my kid has joined in multiple group private lessons with Mark and other VCH coaches (that I got to sit by and watch). They follow the same script as with all of their other classes. Close focus on the technical skills at hand, plus lots of reps and a good workout. They make it fun for the kids, without fooling around or wasting time.So there you go. If you are a beach volleyball player who is looking to get better, or a newbie looking for a way to get started, VCH is probably the premiere outlet for doing so. Sign up and come on out, no extra charge for the beautiful weather and scenery!",Eric C
50,Good times,I‚Äôve been playing volleyball for 12 years and I really have to say I have never seen training for beach volleyball that was so accessible and so focused on THE RIGHT THINGS! I‚Äôm obsessed with how specific the classes are. Well done VolleyCamp.,Philip B
50,Best South Bay Volleyball Coaching,"I love they have an easy way to drop into any class, just about any day. I like all the coaches are current pro-players teaching the game as it is played now.",billyjones1344
50,Best Beach Volleyball Camp!,"Awesome camp! Mark is an amazing athlete, coach, connector... And extra bonus, you'll get coached by other pros as well, check out cool local hangouts, get tested on strength, vertical, etc, and most importantly you'll have fun and improve your skills tremendously!",Arina G
50,Week of Beach Volleyball,What a great week of volleyball and learning. Mark is a great coach who communicates very well what you need to do... to improve. Getting to watch pro's practice and play was a great experience ... they were really cool and willing to talk volleyball. I would recommend this camp any day.Thanks Mark! And Alison...,AlanVolleyball
50,Volleycamp Hermosa!,"This was a truly unique and awesome volleyball experience in the Mecca of sand volleyball. My friend and I did the Volley Vert week of training, which included lodging (breakfast), unlimited training (two 45 min sessions in the mornings, two 45 minute sessions in the evenings), a yoga session during the week, two work-out/training sessions that tested our squat, deadlift, agility, mobility, and even a cryogenic treatment session. And that was just the formal training. We also played plenty of pickup, practiced what we learned, and played in a tournament the next weekend. It's really a great way to kick-off getting your volleyball skills to the next level.However, don't be afraid if you're a beginner either. Mark's training sessions are open to a variety of skill levels, and you can pick and choose which sessions you want to attend.The training is very technical and personal. Most training sessions were between 6-10 participants, which was great for receiving criticism. We learned a ton about strategy, form, serving, passing, hitting, angles of attack, vision, patience, you name it. Mark has a very keen eye for seeing what you're doing correctly and incorrectly, encourages filming so you can see yourself, and gives you the feedback you need in real time.A couple other really cool things about the camp:-Met awesome people from all over the world that were there to train with Mark or just passing through, including people at high levels of play and those just in the area for fun.-Met locals who come to his training sessions as their schedules saw fit. Was great for making connections to play pickup and other activities during the week/weekend.-Got to experience Hermosa nightlife, as typically the group would go to dinner and drinks in the evenings. Mark/Allison were great hosts from this respect.-Got to witness Olympic level training sessions and a qualifying tournament with great players.All in all, if you can't tell yet, we had a great week. Thank you Mark and Allison!",Robert F
50,Beach Volleyball Classes unlike any others,"I'm writing this review as the owner and I just want to shared how we have changed the game for beach volleyball training. There is no other company offering consistent training from a national team coach like we do and no other company giving you access to professional players, their training and their knowledge. Sit courtside while World Tour Teams practice. Meet other beach volleyball players. Get deals and discounts with our partners so you can fully enjoy LA. Our training programs have been meticulously designed so that no matter what your level or interest, we have a specific class to suit your needs. Our hotel partners are amazing and our classes stay small so feedback is always high. We take pride in what we've built because it's different than the rest and we will continue to strive for the best possible classes, vacations and total experience.",Mark B
50,What a great experience!!,"What a great experience!! Live literally ON the beach (walk out front door and there is no front yard, its the sand and ocean! Mark is a former pro-volleyball player and is a really amazing coach and teacher (not bad to look at either girls). This is the best camp ever for adults! Tons of really nice people live in this town and there is always something to do after class -restaurants, bars, etc.",JulsDen
50,Volleycamp,Exceptional people and exceptional training. This trip was by far the highlight of my year and volleyball career. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone wether you play volleyball or not. Mark is an amazing host and friend. He wants you to have the time of your life when you visit his camp. He also wants to make you better in every aspect of your game. You will not be dissapointed,Aaron L
