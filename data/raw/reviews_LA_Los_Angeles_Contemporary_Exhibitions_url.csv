50,Annenberg Space for Photography,"Located in Century City the Annenberg space is a mid century delight. The photo exhibits rotate every few months. Have seen them all and they range from really good to spectacular. A must see if you live in LA or are visiting. Right next to Annenberg is Craft restaurant, Tom C from Top Chief's restaurant. Great to have a drink or dinner after. Food is great and service too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634ChristineW634
