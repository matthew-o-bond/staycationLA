50,My First Fishing Experience!,"While it was my first time fishing, the crew and everyone involved were extremely helpful, from helping me unhook my fish to filleting them all after we were done. I sailed on the Monte Carlo for a half day fishing adventure and it was incredible. There was a small kitchen on the boat and they cooked up breakfast and lunch for everyone. We caught some rockfish and whitefish, enough for 20 people! The boat was perfect for what we were doing.It got a little crowded at times but that's to be expected. I rented a rod, bought a 1-day license, and everything else we needed for a day on the water. It's pretty far from DTLA, which was where I was staying. Can also be easily reached via Uber if you don't have a car.Overall, had a great time, caught about 15 fish, and enjoyed my day on the water! Will be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MGonthego
50,Sportsfishing Pursuit,"My first time fishing with this company, booking from the UK on line and online payment was easy.I had booked on the full day trip and sailing was at 6 a.m. It was a long journey out to Catalina Island but the views there were well worth it. The fishing experience was very different to anything I had experienced before. Only using a hook no weight and live bait which there was plenty of. 5 yellowtails were taken and some calico bass and barracuda.The deck hand worked hard all day advising and landing fish. Great pride was taken by the crew of their boat.Would definitely go again if I had a chance.Tight Lines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceirionp2015
50,Good food,"Nice restaurant with a great view of the harbor, had a wonderful teriyaki steak, with great salad and side dishes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigf977
40,Great Rock fishing but limited time I the kelp.,"I went with four other coworkers during Fathers Day week . They offered a $20 discount if booked online. Even with the discount the boat was not crowded. The deck hands were very helpful in getting you set up, landing fish or untangling you with other fishermen.The pros: good size boat, nice galley and plenty of bunks if you need to rest at any time during the trip. The captain really tries to put you on fish. Great deck hands.The Cons: slow boat, it took nearly three hours to get to the backside of Catalina from San Pedro, including a stop at the bait barge. I like fishing the kelp beds for Calico Bass & Barracuda but we only stopped very briefly maybe a half hr on the kelp beds on our way back in the late afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seahunters2000
40,I'd go again!,"This review is for the Sea Angler, 3/4 day trip for sand dabs.I haven't been on a few open party trips, and sand dabbing is definitely different (and something to try, at least once).I got to the tackle shop, and they of course advised me to use a rental rod rather than my Calstar only rated for 12-25#--so I did. Glad the rental had a rail mount, it ended up making it a heck of a lot easier to balance and reel in the line later!My only complaint was that the website says the trip is $50, but when I got there they charged me $55. When I asked the lady at the window, she's like yeah they upped the price cause.. and kind of trailed off and I still have no idea why they upped the price.We had 31 anglers on board and we were doomed with sand dab fishing approximately 300 feet below. The two deckhands (Chris and ??) were great. They were constantly waiting to fix the next tangle and quick to help as needed. They were also working the galley and eager to cook something up for anyone who asked. Very friendly folks, really on the ball for everything.Overall, on fishing alone--well worth it. You will get a ton of sand dab if you have the patience and strength to fish for it. These guys definitely know where to go! The deckhands are amazing and ready to help anyone out. My only complaint, as said, was the $5 price increase at the window--otherwise, check it out sometime! It's pretty fun catching 9 fish at a time! ;)And a note to those who have not fished before:You will be expected to pay for tackle: hooks, line, weights especially if you are renting a rod. However, the tackle that is sold in the shop providing the sportfishing, should set you up with the CORRECT tackle and have you pay for it. You will not be able to return anything at the end of the day, used or not. If you ever plan on fishing again, plan to bring it on your return trip. Iron (weights) are NOT cheap, and people will lose them to snagged rocks, etc. which is why they are not provided to you, free. This is the same with every sportfishing company, or they would lose money. You can always bring your own gunny sack, and your own everything and not have to pay to use theirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhishPhood
30,Wouldn't go back.,"First time fishing with this company. Went on the boat ""the pursuit"". Check in went well. Payed $65. Had to rent polls ($15 each) and tackle and we were told by the employee which weights and hooks we would need to buy from him. $50 later we got onto the boat. Deckhands were helpful, boat was nice. Didn't see the captain much, which was fine. Deckhand helped tie knots for our hooks and such, he told us we didnt buy the correct size weights and we could buy the correct ones from him. We did for $3 a weight, which seemed a bit much. Didn't realize a place to store your fish during the trip was going to cost also. $2 each bag to buy on boat. Fished all day. At the end, they offered to filet the fish and after finishing said it was $25, eeek! The past charter boats ive been on always did this for free. At the end of the day we went to return the polls and ask if you could return the weight they said we needed and didn't use, they would not return them for us even though they were still in the plastic. All in all, it was ok. Just be careful because they charge for every single little thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthaslaby17
