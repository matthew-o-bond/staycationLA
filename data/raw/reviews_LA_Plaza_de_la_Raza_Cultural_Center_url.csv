50,loved it!,"I attended a fundraising event here and had no idea such a beautiful center existed in it's neighborhood. Plaza de la Raza is an afterscool non-profit, they have classes in the visual and performing arts for ages 5-adult and is located inside of Lincoln Park in Los Angeles. (not too far away from downtown)There was a student art exhibit up at the time in their gallery which was pretty amazing considering the ages of some of the entries. I picked up a catalog and hope to attend some classes soon, their prices are very reasonable! More so than many other places I have looked into, and being able to learn in such a fresh, colorful and dynamic facility makes it even better. I think their site is (--) for more info. Highly recommened and very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tipsandtreats
