40,A fun place for birthday parties and activities,Adventure place is a great hangout for the kids. They have a tubes. Slides. Swing climbing area. Separate area for toddlers. They have a gym for basketball and outside three different climbing walls and a small ropes course. They have two rooms for birthday parties. We have hosted our kids parties at Adventure plex. And this last weekend went to a friends party. Great space. Have fun. @nickellfamilytravel,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel
30,Fun for kids on a Rainy Day,"This place is fun for kids, but it's very loud, stuffy, and I can't imagine thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis. Good for the occasional rainy day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ScottmanP71
40,This place is just the best for grandkids and.. ME!,"This place is just the best for grandkids and.. ME! But seriously, it was a lot of fun. I wasn't really keen on these play spaces until I came to Adventureplex, it opened my eyes to a whole new world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ace90266
40,Great Spot for Birthday,"We hosted our sons birthday party at Adventure Plex. The downside is the main play area is not private just for your party, they allow non guests to also use the area. But the upside is there is a lot to do and the kids are safe. They do offer for an extra fee an outside climbing wall that can be exclusive for your party. The kids and adults like this activity. They do not allow outside food. But the food they use for catering is pretty good. My only recommendation is to bring your own water. You are bringing a cake, so just bring in a case of water as well. Especially on hot days. Have funparking is easy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel
50,Great for visitors and locals ( I happen to live borderline Manhattan Hermosa beach.,"As a local, I have been going there for many years and still learn from the different docents who are eager to share their knowledge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosemaryg957
30,Great Place But Dirty,My kids love going there but I feel like everytime we go my kids get sick within a few days. The ball pit is nasty. But again kids has a great time. So I keep going back. Makes no sence to someone without kids but those of you who do know. Anything for a few minutes of quiet. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/family0f5traveling
40,Great Place for kids with energy,Love the Safe enviroment .The food is always good healthy choices a great place for Kids Parties!I tried the extra large maze so fun even a work out area for 18 and older and a rock climbing wall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaK7
50,keep your children busy,It's a wonderful place to keep your children entertained. They will play through the balls and up and down the ladders. There are also places where you can sit and watch your children while they play.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barbj55
50,"Kids Love It, Parents Get Tired of It.",Great little play area with a large ropes course and mid-size gym. The tube room is heavily used for birthday parties. Kids will scoot through the tubes followed more slowly by parents trying to rescue a crying toddler who is invariably in the highest spot. Place is not overly large and it is well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/104jamesg
40,Love the parents night out option,Friday and Saturday nights 5:30-9pm with a 10pm pick up option is awesome!!! My kids always have a fabulous time. super resonalbe on the price just wish it would start at 5pm for a full 4 hours of me time. They feed the kids- have a craft and lots of fun play time in the indoor structure.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmberH809
40,fun for young ones,I'm a nanny and I've been here with many kids. Overall the young ones have a ton of fun (up to 4 years old) on the inside structure. But over 5 yrs old they start getting bored. The service is also terrible. I would never send my kids to camp here- they hate it. Just take them on the weekend & stay with them,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielleM466
30,Ropes course and rock wall,"We did the ropes course and climbing wall. It's a good afternoon outing for kids age 12 and under. There were a lot of young couples and a corporate team building group as well. If you are really into rock climbing, this won't be the spot for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
40,Fun for preschool through elementary school kids,"At first glance, this is an indoor play-place... but it is so much more. For the younger children, actually, there is a ball-pit and a designated (small) area for them to play in. For the older kids, there is a large climbing structure where they can slide, glide, run around in. It is even sort of fun for grown-ups (if you are that type of grown-up). The play structure is fun for ages 5-8. For the older kids, there is a sport-court which is extra and often not available due to classes, or b-day parties, or for unknown reasons. There is also outdoors rock-climbing (also extra) but it seems rather tame compared to Hangar 18. The camps are fun and entail a lot of physical activity for the kids; also they do a great job with children's bday parties which are expensive, but convenient for the parents who are hosting. The downside is, the facility seems very hard to keep clean, so use hand sanitizer frequently. Also, you cannot bring in your own food, and the admission fee only covers 2 hours in the play area. However, it is a great and easy way to entertain the kids for a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAWorkingMom
