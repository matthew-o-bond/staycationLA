50,A great way to see a US courthouse,We had a short time to wander around Downtown LA and stumbled across the old Courthouse building adjacent to the City Hall. With nothing better to do we stepped inside and were very warmly welcomed by the very friendly security guards who showed us around the art deco entrance hall and invited us to tour the public parts of the building. The elevators were ornate art deco design. This is well worth a short visit if you have a spare 30 minutes- perhaps combine it with a trip to City Hall which is just across the road,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alickb2016
