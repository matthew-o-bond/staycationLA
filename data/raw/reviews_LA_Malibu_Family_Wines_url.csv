50,Minnesota Nice,We drove to the winery and parked. A quick trolley ride to the main entertainment area where live music was happening. We shared 2 bottles of wine....good tasting wine and had a wonderful day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/483neilj
40,Great place to hang out,"My family was in town (from the east coast) so we decided to check out Malibu Wines. We only went to the winery. The space is great! Large open space with a lot of tables of varying sizes. We went on a Friday and did not have to reserve a table ahead of time. You can choose to either do a Red Wine tasting, White wine tasting, or get a bottle of wine for the table. The wine itself was ok, especially compared to what we found in Temecula, but the ambience was beautiful.They also only sell cheese and crackers in the mini shop, so we brought our own lunch. The one drawback to the whole day was the number of yellowjackets that swarmed to our table as soon as we took out our sandwiches. We had to pack up lunch halfway through eating because there were no short of 10 yellowjackets flying onto our food and around us.Overall, a really good wine experience, I just wouldn't bring food next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benkS4864RP
50,Walk and wine,"And animals! What more could you ask for? We arrived at 2:00 and left at 10:00 pm. After wine tasting we stayed for a comedy show. Had a really good time all around. We went on a Friday and had a great parking space. From what I heard, weekends are crazy and parking is not good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/helentL7172SO
50,Wedding at Saddle Rock Ranch,"What a beautiful setting for a wedding! The views were amazing. We went to Chateaux le Dome for the wedding and reception. The drivers for the shuttles up to the mountain/hillside were great and very helpful when we needed to get back to our car for my daughters bag. My daughter also loved seeing the animals in the parking lot (zebra, camel, etc.). Wish we would've had more time to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheljowo
50,Great place to spend an afternoon,"Beautiful location high in the mountains above Malibu. Wine selection is nice and varied. Something for everyone. You can bring your own picnic foods. Lots of tables, nice live music on weekends. Great, fun atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caribbeingjeff
40,A great get away just around the bend!,"Malibu Family Wines is a great place to go to get a little break from Los Angeles. Any time you have family coming to town (who enjoy wine), this is a must stop! It's beautiful! I'll take you through a normal visit for me...They don't serve food here, but they allow you to bring in whatever food you like! If you're traveling here from the 101 and get off at the Kana exit, there is a little plaza on your right with a gas station and other things. There is a convenience store there that has a deli in the back and they make terrific subs!!! Stop here and get a few subs to take with you! Or take whatever you want from home.Be prepared that they no longer let you park in their lot right next to here. You have to park in a lot down the street and they have a free shuttle that will take you here. While I've always understood why they did this on weekends when it's VERY crowded... I was disappointed to learn that they do this ALL the time now... even on a random Tuesday evening when we were one of 3 parties in the entire place. One cool thing is if you drive towards the back of the free lot you can see a few zebras, horses and other things (they used to have a camel, but I didn't see it last time I was there).So make sure you give yourself extra time for the shuttle. Once you get in though... the grounds are simple beautiful. It's a great place to drink wine. We used to be members here, and the prices have gone up significantly in the past few years. They have two labels here... Semler and Saddle Rock. We're a fan of Semler, but don't care much for Saddle Rock. You can do tastings here that used to be $10, but are now $18. And you can't purchase by the glass here... only bottles, which range, but the good ones are around $50. Not every wine even with the Semler label blows me away, but there are some real gems. Explore and do a tasting and get a bottle.So with all that said, it makes me want to change my rating from 4 stars to 3... BUT then you sit down, drink wine, talk and take in your surroundings and realize that this experience is somewhat unique and you're going to have a hard time finding this anywhere else this close to LA. So it can keep the star. The staff is usually very friendly. This is a wonderful place to go with groups and to have a birthday! Just make sure if you're coming with a large ground on a weekend you get there early! But on a weeknight, you're golden. One more warning... they close at 7. That's lame in my opinion as this place is BEAUTIFUL at night... but that tends to be what other places do around here too, so maybe it's for legal reasons.The good and the bad mixed... you need to check this place out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
40,Always a good idea,"Trying to decide what to do in Los Angeles on the weekend isn't always easy. I can say without hesitation that a day spent at MFW is never a disappointment. While being slightly crowded (bring a picnic blanket in case you can't get a table) feature live music. You can bring your own food & snacks as well. There are plenty of picture perfect spots to boot. If you're a local and you're the type of person that will spend $20+ on a bottle of wine at the store, I HIGHLY suggest you join the wine club. One of the benefits of being a part of the wine club (which includes fresh, free shipping), is that you get 2 free flights per visit and a discount on the wines. So, if you normally buy 3 bottles of wine at $25 a piece, joining the club technically won't cost you anything and you get some cool benefits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgiorgianni

50,Always a pleasure,"I love Malibu Family wines. I have been a member of the wine club for many years. There is really no other tasting room quite like it. They have wonderful events and a beautiful and unique location, and the wine is delicious. I prefer to go on a week day so I can avoid the crowds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Erizabif
30,Worth a visit. Better than 3 but not 4,"Kind of a fun place. The ambience is inviting. It's a great place to relax, try some wine flights and enjoy friends and family time. We tried the red and the white flights before we settled in a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc. Nice, fruity and enjoyable. Of the 12 wines we tried we only liked 3, hence one star lost.The employees weren't as personable as I've experienced at other wineries which is what counted for losing the other star. Overall, is come again if I'm in he area. Come during the week if you can as it will be less crowded and more relaxed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JefeHenk
50,Family time,"Had a great time listening to good live music, enjoying the beautiful weather, the picnic we brought and the wine we bought at the winery. The only thing I'm not pleased with is the parking. You can't park on the grounds on the weekend, you must take a shuttle and it's inconvenient. But getting a table for 8 without a reservation was pretty easy!!!! LOVED THE DAY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maryhelenembry
10,Don't join the wine club,"The safari is nice but I made a big mistake in joining the wine club. They promote events at the winery and perks if you join, but I did not get a single email from them. Then when I followed up re the big event they were having for us 'members' - it took two weeks for them to call me back. The big event was over.Terrible customer service and no direct line for wine club. Rude staff. They said they didn't have my email - but they didn't ask for one!!! Totally frustrating experience and highly unprofessional. Lauren Reynolds sent a rude email telling me that I was still obligated to buy wine from them and that I was to drive to Malibu to get it! Shocking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sundayunlimited

40,Birthday celebration,This place is a fun party place. You need a reservation if not it's hard to get a table and they have a maximum capacity as well.The wines are ok but it's just fun and you can bring your own food. They have a live band with great music. They shuttle you to the winery because the parking is limited.The shuttles run pretty consistent and it's just a lively place to have some wine and picturesque. The only thing is that they have porta potties and they don't have regular bathrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanyas937
50,This Place Is Awesome!,"We went for their ""Sips & Giggles"" event that they have the first weekend of every month and it was great!! The had 3 great comedians and we enjoyed some good wine. The atmosphere was great! Beautiful grounds and the trees with white lights, along with heaters for every table. The staff was extremely helpful and accommodating with our large group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W2506DUmarkc
30,Not the place for a tasting,"This is not the place for people who are even semi- serious about wine! One would go here more for the ambiance and the notion of sitting outdoors with a purchased bottle of wine. The options for tastings are available but the idea of waiting in line over and over is a waste of time. Not to mention the inconsistent pours and rude bartenders. (who are completely clueless about the wine they are pouring) We were there on a Sunday night in the fall and the place was packed.The upstairs was closed for a private party yet when we randomly walked up through a different unmarked entrance, we found tables galore open. The private party was long over! The artificial turf seems a bit hokey too. Do yourself a favor and book at their sister company- the Malibu Safari tour. Feeding a giraffe while tasting wine was definitely more interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucyp872
40,wines and a giraffe,"Visited the winery for a wedding. The grounds are amazing. The giraffe even posed for wedding pics. If you come on your own, make sure to bring food. They do not serve food if you are not there for a catered event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellysp2016
30,Wine tasting is average at best...,"Hubby scheduled a beautiful day at Malibu Wines for our one-year wedding anniversary (Monday, September 12th). With the beautiful landscape, ambiance & weather, this would have been an exceptional experience--sans the tasting staff--I couldn't be less impressed.The first woman that greeted us was pleasant and got our wine tasting experience off to a nice start. However when she disappeared, we were left with a disinterested & aloof attendant who cared more about what music/podcast to play from her iPhone than pouring out next wine ...(she never ended up playing any music by the way, which was the hilarious part). Anyway, I'd have to say the customer service on that day (a slow Monday) was below average. Thankfully, my husband arranged a lovely picnic for us and we were able to enjoy that in spite of the sub-par service (by the way, we purchased their $50 cab as a courtesy--it was nice, but the poor service during the tasting soured any positive feelings that would have accompanied the purchase).After the tasting, we went on to the Malibu Wines Safari tour which was AMAZING & the tour guide/customer service there was well above average. A separate Malibu Wines Safari tour review will follow, but shot out to Alex & Wes in advance who lead our ""peacock"" van tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BMWBrandi
40,Great tasting experience,"The place is great, and choice of wines good enough for the gentlemen like myself and friends. We enjoyed the process a lot, and selected a few grapes we'd like to have in our cellar.However, the place is so good, that there are times, when it is complicated to find a table or even piece of grass to lay on. Being an owner, I'd seriously consider extension.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IhorKostiv

50,Very surprising.,"So who knew that there was a surprisingly good little winery in Malibu California? Not me, so my wife and I had to check it out. Malibu family wines is a cute and quaint little winery right smack in the mountains of Malibu. The winery is located across the street from the Safari ranch, which you have to check out, but this little place is as cute and fun as it gets. With a dozen red wines, and a dozen white wines, there's plenty to choose from in to family wine labels. The vistas and scenery are gorgeous, the staff is friendly, and I highly highly recommend Malibu family wines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dhavekost
40,Enjoyable visit,"You can't go wrong here. Good wine and beautiful scenery. We did both flights of white and red and bought a bottle Chardonnay to take home and the red blend to drink there. We bought some cheese, meat and crackers in the cute little shop there and picked a table to enjoy. They had a stage for musicians to play. That would have been a bonus. The next day we signed up for the Safari wine tour they offer. That was a must do if visiting Malibu.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terriflys33
50,Relaxing Afternoon at a vineyard garden lounge,"Had no idea what to expect when we ventured out to Malibu Family Wines. Beautiful drive from Santa Monica, Parked in the free shuttle parking. Purchased a bottle of Red Zin to enjoy ($31.00) ~ no service by he glass only bottle or flight ($15/$16 for the equivalent of one glass). Area is beautiful but busy. Live band played excellent music. Being a blanket if you'd like a place to sit down, tables are reserve only. There is limited food to purchase in the ""market"" store (cheese, crackers, olives) recommend you bring a picnic lunch or snacks. Overall great experience and the glasses are complimentary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_2_the_4th_Power
50,lovely go prepared with your own picnic,"This was such a lovely afternoon but be prepared as there is no food to buy, take a picnic, make it a tea party - all you do is buy the wine. We, a family of 5 all adults - did not see any children about - very hot afternoon, picnic, well organised parking, toilets, security, no silliness, band of 2 playing, dancing and fun. So many tables were special birthday parties or celebrations with cakes, flowers and boho. such a lovely time in an amazing setting xxx defo a place to feel 'the love' .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chelseatraveller121
40,Saturday Afternoon In the Sun,We were taken to this event on a blisteringly hot afternoon. The winery is well organised and we parked for free and were transported to the gardens where wine bars and tastings were set up. There was live music ( a two piece which were too weak to be effective & too MOR to be interesting but hey it was free ) and a disco which did get folk up on their feet even in 100degF. Wine by the bottle ranged from $22 to $26 from memory and was excellent. Surprisingly they charged $3 for carafes of filtered water which were essential given the alcohol & weather. The more sensible staff provided free refills but it was hit n miss and some tried to charge. A good time was had by all. It's a beautiful drive out to the Santa Monica Mountains.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NewForestView
40,Fun with a group,"We loved coming here for a birthday party. We were able to reserve 2 picnic tables next to each other and it was great being able to share wines and the food (we brought). We ordered by the bottle since we had a fairly large group. The grounds were pretty and the bathroom are the nice portable potties. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Wish we could have done the safari, but that just means next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sigirl33
50,Complete Gem!,"My friends and I were visiting from Florida and had the best time. Parking wasn't the greatest, Valet was $14 and there is a shuttle to a nearby lot. There are tables to eat your own provided lunch, or you can setup on the grass. There's a live band with a dance floor, which was packed full of happy people! Truly a great experience and the wine was good too! :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/45melanier

50,Charming country look in the mountains of MALIBU,"This is the only winery actually opens the whole week to the public, most of the wineries in Malibu, even Rosenthal on the touristic highway 101 running along the ocean where closed on Monday. So we drive to one winery to other found all where closed except for Malibu wines. The flighs for the local Malibu wines were more expensive $15 but worthy, we loved the red blends, and the guy who help us was very helpful and told us a little introduction of each wine any time he poured us. We took to many pictures around the charming gardens, the fish tanks and the old vintage cars and buses around the winery,plenty of cute places for photography. The gift shop has also a unique charming array of good,cheeses, honey, jellies and jewelry. Definetely a place worthy to stop by any time of the week. Becaise different to other wineries in the region, is the only that opens 7 days a week. The parking lot is small but perfect for the public that goes there on weekdays, on weekends you have to park in another lot further away from the winery, I don't know where and climb in a shuttle that brings you to the winery grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/237alessandrat
50,great place for a group to visit,relaxing spot with lots of space to sit down and enjoy the weather while tasting some good wine. Prices on the wines are not expensive and pretty tasty!

40,Great Place to visit and hang out for a bit,"Visited here with some friends during a Tuesday mid-day wine tasting outing. It was fairly quiet while we were there but we were glad to have the full run of the place to check everything out. I live up in the San Francisco Bay Area Great stop to and travel to Napa and Sonoma quite a bit, so while the wines were much lighter than what we have up here, I was surprised to find a couple of the white wines that were very enjoyable, especially on a hot day!! You can order food if you want, but we had brought some on our own to snack on which was not a problem. I understand they have music on the weekends and would like to come again at some point to check that out. Great stop to include on your wine trek!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DNAZ_SF

50,Great Friday lunch,"My girlfriend and I decided to travel from Santa Monica, up the PCH to Malibu Family Wines. It was the highlight of our trip! I suggest stopping at Ralph's grocery store at 23841 Malibu Rd, Malibu, CA 90265, before heading up as you're allowed to bring your own food. We were there from 11:30am-3pm. Had the entire upper part to ourselves with a fantastic view. Loved the Country music playing. It's a great place to tasted some wine and spend an afternoon eating and conversing. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.We spent around $70 for 2 tasting flights (6 per flight) and a bottle of wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FortLauderdaleAaron
40,"Malibu, Santa Monica Mountains & Wine","We decided to take a ride along the beautiful PCH from the South Bay Beach communities like Redondo, Hermosa and Manhattan up to Malibu and thought it wouldn't be far off the highway to check out Malibu Wines. Having enjoyed Sonoma and Napa in Northern California and many of the wineries spread among the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York, I wasn't sure what to expect. The drive, of course, is beautiful and once you head inland about 5 miles climbing the mountain, it's certainly a surprise to come upon a vineyard producing grapes! So different than more traditional vineyard settings.It's a great location and those who were not first-timers like us were smart to bring along their favorite appetizers or even small meal to enjoy on the scenic property. We were told they do have live music on the weekend and I believe them when they say people pack the place.The three of us all tried the same flight of wine, the Semler, produced with strictly their own grapes. Two other flights had a mixture of their grapes and other regionally produced grapes. Of the on-site grown grapes, the best wines we had and also purchased were their just released 2011 Cab and their very tasty, dessert-type of white wine--the Bisous.It's a very rustic, almost ranch like setting. The owner and his spread are right across the road and just before you arrive at the wine-tasting setting ahead on the left. Lovely setting, beautiful drive and you may find a wine or two that you enjoy. It's definitely more about the experience they offer with the ability to bring your own food and also the live music when it's available rather than a variety of outstanding wines. But, most people will find something they would like to drink and make for a nice half-day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SignorPicky
40,Great place to enjoy a picnic with friends,"The drive up to this place is lovely with views of the coast most of the way up the mountain. Nearing the top, the vegetation gives way to mostly rock and sand and you can start to appreciate the 'desert' part of LA.I went here with some friends of mine and arrived just before 4pm. We packed our own dinner and ordered the holiday flight of wine. I'm not a wine person so I can't comment on the wine but the atmosphere of this place was like crashing someone's outdoor ranch-style wedding - in a great way. The band was playing hits from the 70s and 80s, lots of people were dancing, lots of little white lights which gave the place a nice glow for light and there was a really awesome happy vibe to everyone in the place but this might have also had to do with arriving within 2 hours of closing!We visited the place on a Sunday night. If I had to do it over again, I would still stay around 2hrs but plan to arrive an hour earlier so we could enjoy the place with the band playing in the background.A nod to the good service at the bar, they were casual or chatty depending on your own vibe and they kept track of your tasting so you could enjoy each glass at whatever pace suited you. It probably goes without saying that you can bring your own food but you can't bring any alcohol with you to this place.There is valet parking but you can keep the 14$ for drinking by driving 5 mins further down the road to their larger parking lot and using their free shuttle (looks like an old trolley car complete with wooden bench seating). There was no schedule to the shuttle but we only ended up waiting at the end of the night (about 5mins) for a pickup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa9319

I can only imagine how busy they are on the weekend. We were there on a Wednesday and it was still fairly busy.The staff are polite and helpful. We enjoyed our chat with the guy pouring. We each did a flight. I did not really like the wine. I felt it was poor for CA wine - average anywhere else. Disappointing as I would go back for the view if the wine was any better! Would also be nice if they had food or snacks for sale (fruit, crackers, cheese, etc.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajt4
30,"Neat spot, meh wines","I liked this place for the atmosphere: great spot for a picnic, live music and relaxing with friends. The wine tasting was okay: I thought the flights were a little boring and overpriced for the wine they serve. In other words, I didn't really care for the wine at this winery. It wasn't BAD, but I didn't want to have seconds or buy any of it. In general, we had a fun day (and it got PACKED as the day went on, so it seems to be popular spot). Not sure I'd be in a hurry to go again with so many fantastic places to check out in Cali. But was glad I went and enjoyed myself. Bottom line: the draw is not the wine, it's the experience and atmosphere of the place itself. In my opinion, of course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleyDelSignore

50,Perfect for 1st time wine tasters!,"I enjoyed my first ever wine tasting at Malibu Wines last week! My husband and I were in Malibu for the day and found this place on Trip Advisor initially. It wasn't very crowded, since we were there on a Monday night and it has beautiful grounds for picture taking. The wine was delicious - my husband opted for a flight of red wines and I did a light flight of mostly white wines. Drew was the employee assisting us and he was very knowledgable about each of the wines. He described them as he poured them before we tasted them which helped us get an idea of what we'd be sampling. We'd definitely recommend Malibu Wines in the future for any future first time wine tasting visitors and also for anyone looking for a relaxing, mellow wine tasting place in Malibu. Some miscellaneous comments: very clean bathrooms, very clean grounds over all, and we got to take our wine glasses home as souvenirs!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKC324
30,Fun but not for an oenophile,"As an oenophile I was less than impressed with the wine and environment of Malibu Wines. If you are a lover of fine wine and enjoy Napa or Sonoma, this will seem like a frat party.WINESWine is only served by the bottle or in flights. In my opinion, the wine is not very good. I tried several and only liked the Chardonnay.FOODThey do NOT serve food or snacks so bring your own. Along with a blanket or chair to camp out on the grass with your bottles of wine.SERVICEThe servers really didn't know wine or how to pour it. For example, while enjoying a flight the server poured the second wine into the same wine glass. Never had that happen at a tasting before.RESTROOMSTwo standard restrooms and several outhouses.VALETQuick and courteous. I would recommend such since the venue is on a dirt road. Parking on your own would be tough.Overall, this is a fun day trip for friends. But do not expect an exemplary sensory experience. Go there to get drunk and share a few laughs while looking at the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FitWhit816

We brought food we had purchased earlier from the fabulous Calabasas Farmers Market and of course bought our wine there. The wine was excellent.We saw bridal showers, bachelor parties, themed groups, and groups into amazing cheese with their wine.We enjoyed live music and the people watching was fascinating.Even if there isn't a table available, bring a blanket and sit on the turf.

40,Malibu Wines,"A beautiful location for a picnic with friends. All they serve is wine and water, so bring your own snacks, soft drinks and picnic blanket. Web site says they don't take reservations, but when we arrived there were several tables with ""reserved for"" signs that stayed empty the whole time (about 3 hours). So apparently, they do take reservations. Even though they were extremely busy, we were able to squeeze in and do 2 tastings. For our second tasting, the bar tender, recommended that we sit down and just come up when ready for a refill. Overall a beautiful location, will definitely go back with friends, but earlier in the day so we can get a table.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurak179
50,Great winery!,"This place was absolutely amazing. One of a kind area. Loved the vibes, location, and scenery. It was beautiful and the wines were great. Get the local wines. It was so serene and relaxing. I would definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgirl713
40,Fun thing to do - great scenery - so so wines,"We enjoyed our day here, although it was an expensive outing. My tips: Bring a picnic lunch and a blanket, skip the tasting, and just buy a bottle of wine. They are way too busy to spend any time talking about the wines -- it's a rushed experience. The Sauvignon Blanc was good, but I didn't like the reds, even though I prefer red. Once that's over with, the fun begins. You have a beautiful view, surrounded by beautiful people, and live music -- hopefully you've brought good food. It's an enjoyable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingyogi
50,Sunday Birthday Funday with my girlfriends!,"Had the best time at Malibu Wines with five of my girlfriends and will definitely be back!There are three main seating areas: 1) Upper Area - has the best view of the Malibu mountains but in order to get there, you have to walk up this steep ramp which would've been pretty hard with high wedges plus there was no turf 2) Main Area in Front of Stage - table seating closest to stage and live entertainment, and 3) Side Area with Fire Pits - best location in my opinion. We chose the side area with the fire pits (even though the fire pits weren't turned on - assuming this only happens when they're open later than 6p), we arrived at noon and were lucky to get the last seating in this area. This place fills up fast! After we were settled in, more people came to this area but set up picnic style.There were two live performances at noon and 3pm so it was nice to be close enough to hear the music but not sit in a crowded area where we can converse as well.We took munchies like cheese, crackers, fruits, veggie chips, etc. and paired these with the yummy wines that they offered.There are three main areas for wine tasting which includes a mimosa tasting area. We tried the mimosa flight which was amazing (1 champagne with 5 different fruit flavor mixers) and a good start to the day and then followed with just getting bottles of wine after this. Tried the Syrah and Cab Sav and loved both. They offer two types of wine, Semler, which is their estate wine grown right in Malibu and Saddlerock, which is sourced grapes and juice from different vineyards throughout the central coast of California.Great atmosphere and super relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaq4545
30,Nice picnic venue but...,"My sister was visiting from out of town and we decided to check out Malibu Wines. While we're not serious wine conaisseurs, we do enjoy wine and thought it would be a fun thing to do for the day. On arrival, we were a bit put off by the $14 valet parking but the nice guys at the entrance assured us that the shuttle to the free parking lot ran every 5 minutes so we decided to give it a try. I actually enjoyed the short trip to the free shuttle lot as the scenery was spectacular and the shuttle driver was pleasant and chatty. The wine flight (5 wines) appeared reasonable ($12 or $14, depending on what you chose) and the venue was quite attractive. Most people there had brought picnic food and were clearly enjoying their time eating, drinking, and listening to the live music. But as for the wine... we chose the $12 flight as we wanted to try the local wines (the wines in $14 flight were from Central California). Perhaps we chose badly, as we found them all pretty undrinkable. Overall, we managed to have a good time but $12 is a rather stiff price to pay when you are not able to enjoy the wine. I probably won't be back as next time I'll opt to drive a bit further and do my tasting in the Santa Ynez Valley, where I know the wines to be excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hlwdgrl
40,Relax and enjoy the afternoon,"Malibu Family Wines has a very relaxing, fun environment. We purchased two wine tastings and shared between five people.

There are plenty of tables and seats, and a grass area for blankets when those fill up. You can bring your own food and spend the day. The wine isn't amazing like the vineyards in Napa, but try a few and you'll find one that drinks quite nicely. A really great time... just make sure you have a designated driver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joezeo

20,Very disappointing,"My wife and I have visited wineries and tasting rooms all over California, Oregon, Washington and even Hawaii, but this one made me feel like I was at Universal Studios, a tourist waiting to be sucked dry. Because of the limited parking spaces, it was $14 to valet. My wife's bag was searched before we were let in. The flights with just 4 wines was $12 and $14 each. We couldn't start a tab, but had to pay each step of the way. The server we first had didn't give us any information about the wines, though I must say he eventually disappeared and the lady that took over was great. But, to top it all off the wines were not that good in our opinion. The Estate Cabernet Sauvignon was excellent, but $70 a bottle. Maybe we just went on a bad day, but I can't recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EaarO

50,Malibu Wine Safari is a great find with beautiful sights and great wine!,"My husband and I visited Malibu Wines for a ""Date Day"" and had a wonderful time! We really enjoyed the jeep tour of the beautiful property and hearing the history. Feeding the animals were a nice bonus, too! Afterwards we enjoyed a few wines at the wine bar (they're called flights). I liked that each ""flight"" offered a variety of flavors.

50,Like Living in a French Painting ...,"Like Renoir's ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"" or ""Moulin de la Galette,"" picnicking at MFW is a happy, beautiful, full-of-life time. Clusters of family and friends sit on blankets, with half-barrels for table-tops, and dine/drink/talk/laugh the afternoon away while live music plays genially in the air. The Santa Monica Mountains are in view, with their vineyards and over-lapping hills, and the setting sun provides its own light show. The winery's lawn has a string of lights from tree-to-tree that then takes over. The wines we had were delicious ... both the sauvignon blanc and orange muscat, which had more floral than fruity notes. A most memorable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/visuality
20,Don't close your eyes,Parking is very limited and even valet parking gets full then you drive a couple of miles up the road and get a shuttle bus. Shuttle bus seat was wet! Limited choice of wines. Limited seating usually has seats reserved for parties. No food. Good live music. The only good thing. No scenery. If you sit on the grass and rest on your back or when seated in a chair don't close your eyes- its against policy! You will be continually asked if you are asleep - a big no no. Several of shuttle bus on way back to car park said there were better wineries in the area. Ask to see a manager and apparently everyone us a manager. Which makes sense since isn't a real manager around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajkmsteph
40,A Great Place to Bring Friends,"Ok, it’s a bit pricey for a tasting ($14 per person for 4 “tastes”), but our Sunday visit also included some incredible live music and a beautiful day for a picnic. There were many tables set up outside the tasting area – many filled by groups celebrating special occasions. Additional tables were set up in the vineyard just above the stage. You do not need to remain in the tasting booth as you savor each of your selections. Instead you can enjoy them with your picnic meal (we brought cheese, crackers and fruit). On-site valet parking is available or park in the FREE lot a bit up the road and take the FREE shuttle to the vineyard. Plenty of bathrooms are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cleomissy

30,Overall a disappointing experience,"We went on the recommendation of a friend and were disappointed both with the wines and the service. It is set in a lovely spot but we found the wine average and think $15 is quite a lot for 4 one ounce or 30ml tastings of wine. This is much more than we have paid for wine we enjoyed more in Italy, France, Canada, Australia or NZ. The server poured wine into the same glass each time which was not completely empty and didn't have much to say about the wines. It was very quiet the day we went so it isn't like he was busy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nzsuze
50,Wine tasting and relaxing,"Fantastic place to enjoy wine tasting and relax. bring your own food or snacks as they do not serve food and you are welcome to bring your own. Also, check to see if they have live music as we had to leave before the band started.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stanr220
40,Picnic fun in Malibu,"There was a shuttle to another parking lot, yet valet was right there and we did not have to carry our picnic baskets too far to the table. Went there early enough to get a table in the shade with umbrella - so much more comfortable and civilized as we can set the table, have proper plates and silverware; and when we purchased wine, there was bucket with ice and wine glasses provided for the table. Grounds were pretty and well kept, a couple areas for wine tasting and a small stage for performances.It turned out to be one of the hottest sunday in Malibu, however live music was playing, decent chardonnay kept pouring, the crowd was well behaved with ladies in pretty sun dresses and hats, guys in S Cal casuals, all just relaxing, drinking, enjoying picnic and lively atmosphere. It felt like a big backyard party but no obligations to socialize with host and mingle, adding to the enjoyable experiences if i may say was no children, no pets nor screaming babies.....we will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyLA88
50,Tucked Away Gem,"I had a couple of hours after an LA business trip to drive up the coast and explore the sights. After a nice drive up to Point Mugu, I decided to head back via the Santa Monica Mountains. Glad I did because I discovered this wonderful stop tucked into the winding roads with a very very casual, laid back vibe and modestly priced tasting, nice wine. What a great way to relax!This is a delightful outdoors tasting room in a beautiful setting. I visited on a midweek afternoon so it was not busy and I had time to visit with a very knowledgeable and nice server over a sample of the region's wines. I was told it gets very busy on the weekends but there were only a few couples/groups finding their way around the property when I visited. No food is served there but evidently people are encouraged to bring picnics and select a spot to eat among the many scattered garden chairs. This seems to be a can't miss recommendation for anyone wanting to experience a splendid California wine experience close to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Oldmrhare
40,Live Music on a Sunny Day,"We came to Malibu Wines on an invitation to someone’s birthday who was celebrating at the Vineyard. We are not wine drinkers so we cannot speak to the wine itself as it all tastes the same to us. We did try some, but who knows. It’s a picturesque drive up Mulholland to get here and when you arrive there is no parking only Valet. The cost was $14 plus tip. A little steep (Pun intended). We arrived very early without much of a crowd and we are glad we did as people poured in by what seemed like the hundreds throughout the day. As we left we saw a shuttle that took you to some other parking option. Not sure if or what the associated charge was, but perhaps a cheaper option than the valet. By arriving early we were able to get a table right in front of the patio area where the musician performed throughout the afternoon. The musician was fantastic. It added to the mood of the day. They had 2 main bar areas with options for Wine tasting and buying bottles. A few bottles were purchased in our party. The grounds were very well maintained. There were wooden chairs that pulled up to tables made out of used wine barrels which was a nice touch. There was a fish tank in the front area near the bathrooms which said it was from the Tank’d show. There also a faux fountain with what looks like wine coming from a wagon in front. Overall our opinion was certainly shaped by the great weather, location and good music. It was also a great quiet place without kids running around. They carded at the front entrance and the wine seemed pretty pricey, but when in Rome…",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanKelly

40,nice location,Tasting flights for both Semler and Saddlerock wines are available. I went for Saddlerock selection which was ok but nothing exceptional. We also bought a bottle of Semler Cabernet Sauvingon which was nice but definitely overpriced - like wines at most wineries in the States....One can taste much better wines in Hungary or Tuscany on a significantly lower price. Service should have been nicer and more competent. Place was very quiet on weekday afternoon when we visited what we liked a lot. Despite cons this is a nice place to hang out and sip some wine.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monaHungary
50,"so fun! Picnic friendly, live music, good wine","This place is great! It's about halfway between the 101 and PCH on Kanan. They don't serve food so you can bring your own food and get a glass or bottle of wine and hang out all afternoon. They often have live music and it's a fun, young crowd. They don't allow any kids (not even babies) so make sure to leave the kids behind and no dogs either.It opens at 11 on the weekends and I definitely recommend getting there close to opening if you want a table. But if you don't get there early enough to get a table there is plenty of lawn space, just bring a blanket and a hat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruingirl_8
40,Intimate winetasting soiree with 30 close friends in Malibu!,"Met with daughter and a bunch of her friends at Malibu wines last Sunday for music (provided by different performers) and wine tasting (every two or three people bought a bottle of one of the vineyard's wines) and food - which we all brought and shared at the picnic tables provided. The winery let us have tastes of any of the featured offered bottles - though there were more vintages and some sparklers available as well. Waitstaff were lovely! I had two complaints only: 1) we had purchased a groupon for a tasting at the Malibu & Vine Outdoor Wine Bar - and did not realize that this winery was about a mile or so from the location (related businesses) that the groupon offered. We had all these people come meet us, so we could hardly switch locations - and not having been there before, did not realize there were two locations. THAT was a bummer. 2) parking was expensive - and not anticipated. There is lots of space - would have been nice to let wine buyers have discounted parking.I also recommend you go early (when it opens) - especially on a Sunday , when we went, to secure a table. It is very popular.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjeanp

40,An Awesome Day in the Sun,"It's almost always sunny up top Mulholland, so this is a great escape from the marine layer below. This is almost an ultimate picnic destination. Pack your bag grab some friends, bring a blanket or two and head up for music and wine. It's REALLY crowded here on the weekends, but that also makes it great for people watching. Kids of any age are banned. There is now valet parking to help out and the winery has expanded to 3 or more tasting bars. The wine is decent , but a little pricey. I usually op for the bubbles and then follow it up with the Semler Rose. There are several wineries in the Malibu area- one on PCH (Rosenthal) at Topanga Canyon and one down the road from Malibu Wines (SIP), so make a day of it and be thankful that there is a little wine country in our back yard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MyWineAdvisor
40,"Relaxed, casual pinicking with good wine","We came here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday. They don't sell food, so the idea is to jam pack your cooler and hang at the winery. They check bags when you enter, and you're not allowed to bring any alcohol on the grounds (so you can purchase their wines!). I'd recommend getting there early (11:30am) as tables fill up quickly on a nice day. There is live music on the lower level, but we went up the steep dirt path (not wheelchair/crutches accessible) to enjoy a more scenic view at the tables on the hill.There's a typical SoCal vibe, with everything from 20somethings in their hippie headbands to your 50somethings in driving loafers and blazers.It's relaxing, laid back, and a great time to hang out with friends. The Chardonnay was great- but be prepared to pay $30+ a bottle.There was a constant line at the restrooms, so be prepared to spend a good 25min waiting for that. They had 4 out of order port-a-potty things (which didn't fit in AT ALL with the vibe of this winery) The bathrooms are spotlessly clean for the amount of people using them (wine folks are clean people I guess)Friendly staff- overall a fantastic time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeepGirl19

They didn't. We chose several different wine fights to try various wines.The most welcoming staff here are the security people at the entrance checking for outside alcohol. (does beg the question - why would you bring wine to a wine tasting event? so I give them that point)The serving staff were about as unfriendly as you can imagine along with no explanation about what's being poured in the miserably small sample.I had written a lengthy, detailed story of our less-than-enjoyable experience but decided to save everyone the reading and simply say, you should try to find a more welcoming, enjoyable wine tasting experience elsewhere in the area. There are many.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougontheroad

There is no charge, and even the shuttle from nearby parking is free (but do tip the driver). There seems to be no pressure for you to buy any wine from the sales kiosks, but obviously that is the intent.

50,Awesome place to hang out.,"This place is great! You can pack a lunch or some snacks and enjoy some music. It's 21 and up only, so it's a quiet and enjoyable way to spend a Saturday afternoon. When buying a bottle, you actually get wine glasses to use, which is really nice. My one gripe was that the live musician had the volume turned up way too loud and she wasn't that good. It was so loud it didn't seem like pleasant background music, it was more like I was at a show... but that wasn't really the main point of our visit. Anyway, otherwise great spot. Valet was the only on-site parking option, which cost $12... boo!My one tip would be to bring your own cooler of bottled water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marycasey1
50,Highlight of Malibu,"My family has belonged to the Malibu Wines wine club since 2005. It is fantastic. The tasting room is a stunningly beautiful location in the Santa Monica Mountains. We love bringing a picnic, doing a tasting and buying a few bottles to enjoy. Weekends tend to be a bit crowded, especially when there is live music, so it is best to get there early. Week days are better as there are far less people. The wine is great and the staff is knowledgeable. Definitely one of my favorite places in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmarte05

We end up sharing our food, wine, pictures, stories. It is in a gorgeous area and the music makes the whole experience very relaxing. I get to spend time with my husband. Yes, it does get very crowded, that is part of it. We know that going there and manage to get around just fine. Parking can be a hassle as the parking lot is kind of small so we parked along the Hwy which was just fine.

30,"Good wines, OK prices, Great setting = Far too many people.","It's tough to rate this place given that there are some definite pluses to the location and experience and also some equally definite minuses. PLUSES: Good selection of wine that is ""reasonably"" priced. Great location with outdoor seating on several levels. You can grab a table and chairs, bring your own or even spread a blanket on the lawn. Bring a picnic lunch or dinner but as one would expect you can only buy their wine - no outside alcohol. Enjoy the ambiance at night when the area is softly lit. They often have music, at least on the weekends, and even have movie night during the summer. MINUSES: Far too many people on any given weekend and often on weeknights also. This translates into trouble getting to the wine bars and getting served. They simple have too many wine club members and add to the overcrowding by all the non-members that drop by. Parking has also become an annoyance. You used to park along the side of the road. Now because of the hoards of people and vehicles you can't do that and must park in their dirt lot area via valet. It used to be far more fun before the masses discovered it. Really a shame.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisinSOCA

The location in the canyon is beautiful and our host told us about the weekend events and music that occur all summer long. We would love to go back with a picnic for one of the concerts or movies.

50,Fantastic Sunday Wine tasting trip in beautiful Malibu Mountains,"What a wonderful experience and the bartender were so helpful. Love the family atmosphere. Perfect place for wine tasting, relaxing and enjoying the beauty of Malibu Mountains. We are fans!!!!!Cathy & Russ Sharp",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CathyS16
40,"Great Atmosphere, beautiful views, average wine",I recommend this stop on a wine tour of the area. Great place for groups of people to meet or for a first date. Was a little disappointed in the wine but that is a totally personal preference. No kids allowed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCKathleen
50,Relax and sip wine away from the maddening LA crowds!,"My nephew chose this destination while I was visiting LA with other family members. What a choice! It was a delightful sunny, 70 degree day in LA. We visited Whole Foods to pick up ""picnic food""....cheese, cold cuts, bread, grapes, cookies. We set out for Malibu Wines. You will drive up a hilly area adjacent to the Malibu coastline. Park your car and enter Malibu Wines. No alcohol is allowed to be brought in and your bags will be checked.Many round umbrella tables are set up, 2 bars are nearby, and a folk singer was singing away! We secured a table and then proceeded to the bar for a wine menu. We chose 3 different tasting flights to drink as we enjoyed our food. We brought board games and selected Scrabble as the game of the day. We played, drank, ate, and people-watched. Later we came to a decision on a bottle of wine. Wines are pricey...$30 and up if I recall but so good! The vineyards surround you, the music is being played, the wines soothes the soul. A fantastic spot and an easy 45 minutes from LA! Can't wait to go back!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetodance418
50,Perfect way to spend a lazy afternoon just outside of LA,"As an avid motorcycle and sports car enthusiast who spends nearly every ""nice weekend morning"" in the canyons, I've been passing by this place for years and always said ""I need to check that place out one of these days."" I'm so glad I finally did. This place was amazing. The wines are pretty good, but the atmosphere is what gets you. It kind of reminded me of the feeling you get going to the playground when you were kid, except you're an adult!!! And there's booze!!!The set up is quaint yet spectacular. There's a walk up L-shapped bar for tastings, and another for bottle service - both are ""outside,"" but covered so you don't have to worry about being too hot or too cold. The bars are not very large, so you'll need a good bit of patience and keep your elbows in when doing a tasting flight (they have two flights by the way). The grounds are like a huge picninc/park/garden hang out area with outdoor heaters for when it's a bit cool and umbrellas to hide from the sun. Picnic tables, patio furniture, and plenty of space for picnic blankets or folding chairs from home can be found. From what I understand, there's almost always live music or some form of entertainment. The crowd is friendly and it's not unusual to make new friends (even if only for a day) and share wine you and other visitors have just purchased (It's 21 and over, so no worries). It's free to get in, only costs money to do a tasting, to buy wine and wine snacks.If you plan on drinking a lot, pack a bag with food. You don't want to try to drive mulholland under the influence or an empty stomach. If the curves in the canyons don't get you, the cops will. Drink responsibly folks, and enjoy. this is a great little hidden spot that the LA/Venice/SantaMonica hipsters haven't turned out yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Another2Cents
50,"Beautiful Location, Great Wine","My hubby and I visited the wine tasting room last weekend. It was so much fun. Im shocked something like this is so close to LA. Now we dont need to drive to Paso for our wines!While it was very busy, we made our way to the bar and did a tasting, ended up tasting about 8 wines between the two of us. I loved the 02 Cab! The staff was patient and helpful even though so many people were around.We bought a bottle and took it to our picnic blanket where we sipped wine and ate some cheese and pasta from the goodies I brought. By far one of the most memorable things we've done.A few things to know- No one under 21, it gets busy so be patient, parking is on Mullholland so be careful, the wine is great!Look forward to going back for my hubs bday with some friends!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeahThom
