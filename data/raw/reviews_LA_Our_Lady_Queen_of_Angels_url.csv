50,Queen of Angels,"There is a certain spiritual feeling one gets upon entering the basilica chapel of Nuestra Senora Reina de los Angeles, even the long name evokes awe.Every day here, is a reverent sense of refreshment, yet December 12th of any year is an especially meaningful visit, for throngs of faithful flock to pay their respects to their sacred queen. Even National Geographic magazine has called her the most powerful person in all the Americas. This year was the 485th celebration of her first appearance in Mexico City to St. Juan Diego.While her shrine here in Los Angeles is not as old, it holds just as much fervor as any other of her shrines for it was the place Los Angeles was founded. Her simple portrait is located at a side alcove and visitors wait in an endless line to bring her gifts of flowers and other mementos. There was once a custom for young women to grow their hair very long and days before her 12-12th feast day , braid the long hair then cut it and place it at the shrine's altar. Also on the feast day many celebrations take place beginning the singing of ""las manianitas"", an endearing song that captures the love her followers have for her , then come masses and other ceremonies inside the chapel and out in the gazebo on Olvera St nearbyNext time 12-12 comes around and you're in the area be sure to stop at the basilica for a visit that will last a lifetime..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/camnowik98

30,Free Organ Recitals on Wednesdays,"Our retirement ladies' group toured this 13-year old ultra-modern cathedral. While the building leaves me cold, the docent-led tour was wonderful. Our docent, Joe, shared many interesting facts on Los Angeles history, the history of St. Vibiana and the building of the cathedral. There are some beautiful art pieces. I really enjoyed seeing many rescued artifact from the old St. Vibiana's Cathedral (e.g. light fixtures, the main altar and baptismal font. The tapestries in the main church are beautiful with a wonderful back story. This was an outing I wasn't particularly excite about and I left pleasantly surprised and informed. It's worth the time. Because of a miscommunication regarding the time of the organ recital, we opted to eat on the premises at what turned out to be a very good little grab and go eatery. There are plenty of tables and chairs in the plaza to enjoy better than average food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
