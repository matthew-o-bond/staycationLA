50,Loved It!,"Greenbar Distillery is fantastic. They were 6 for 6 with the tastes I selected and any one of the spirits was worth buying. Don't let the downtown area bother you, in fact it adds to the charm. If it wasn't raining we would have walked around exploring the industrial neighborhood. Hint - they have a little parking lot across the street from their front door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/phh26541

40,Our tour of the Greenbar Distillery,"Had a great tour, very interesting and some very good samples. The many different tastes were outstanding. The vodka with the cracked pepper taste would be awesome in bloody Marys. Tour last 40 min. ans our tour guide was a very sweet girl, who knew her stuff. Sorry forgot Name. Tip: very little street parking, so find address and across the street property is owned by Green Bar and has ample parking off street. Only downside is you have make purchases on line only, unless you have a out of state DL....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesR884

50,"Educational, fun & ""spirited""!","So much fun! LA's oldest distillery (est. 2004) is also boasts the world's largest portfolio of organic spirits. The tour is great -- very informative. The cocktail classes are fun & delicious. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about their products. Love this place & love sharing it with people who haven't yet discovered it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/have_time_wil_travel
50,Great distillery tour and tastings!,"Greenbar Distillery is worth a visit...great fun...excellent tour, educational to learn about how they distill and infuse and gain an appreciation for the effort they put into delivering an exceptional, purely organic, tasty product!Located in downtown LA, they offer great tours, tastings and cocktail classes. We attended a private tour and had outstanding service and enjoyed tasting six different 1-oz varities of vodka, gin, whiskey and liquers (favorites were Jasmin and Orange).Facility is located in the Arts District area and there is easy parking available. Tours are reservation only (check out Groupon for a coupon, etc). Tour takes about 45 minutes with tastings and you have the pleasure of indulging in about 6 one ounce tastings of your favorites.They also offer a very nice looking and well designed upstairs level that you can host parties at or sign up for cocktail mixing lessons, etc.Overall great experience and worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryW_SantaMonica_CA
50,"A+ cocktails, tastings and fun!",We had such a great time at the Father's Day tasting and sale event! I stumbled onto this even on some email list I'm on. So glad I booked 2 tickets and came! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed out outing and plan on returning. We even picked up a couple of bottles of liquor!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonFlores
40,Great Distillery & Solid Tour,"Caught the tour here recently with friends.Tour is really solid. ""Guides"" were knowledgeable, personable and friendly. In addition to explaining the distillery's history and their processes, at each of the stations they offered small samples, which was nice.Sampling at the end was fun, and their products are decent. Lots to choose from vodka to gin to tequila to botanicals to whiskey, so something for everyone. My only complaints would be that I wish I could have tried more, and I wish the guide had spent a little less time talking about each of the products in detail at the end. Once he'd spent 5 minutes introducing their straight vodka, didn't necessarily need another 5 on the lemon vodka (it's the same thing... but with lemon...).Definitely recommend for anyone interested in distilling or just having fun trying lots of interesting liquors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrHao
50,So much fun!,"My girlfriend and I went to the cocktail mixing class and we had a great time. The distillery is clean and very nice, we really learned how to make a great cocktail and it was a fun experience. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winelover813
50,Cocktail Mixing Class,Wonderful adventure! Great staff! A fun night out with friends - definitely will return! üòù excellent experience with good drinks!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jgausman
50,Must Try,Had the best time at the Greenbar Distillery Cocktail class. It was very informative and a lot of fun. Definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Martinigal21
50,very entertaining activity,we went as a couple and spend slightly more than an hour and made two cocktails. The instructors were entertaining. The distillery is nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/burbankqt
50,Great fun and wonderful staff!,The craft cocktail class was a blast! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun activity in DTLA. The instructors were funny and very knowledgeable. We were able to get creative and try our own thing for two different cocktails. Great idea! If only they had a bar we could grab some drinks at afterwards! Loved the class and would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8902BDrachels

He told us the basics about creating cocktails and the we where able to come out with Two cocktails on own. It was fun and different.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javiguemes1
50,Wonderful Experience,"I signed up for the Cocktails for Lovers experience and my wife and I loved it. Cocktails for Lovers is an attempt to craft the perfect cocktail for you and your significant other. Bennett, our mixologist and the tasting room manager, had read the questionnaire I had completed online during registration and was prepared with some signature cocktail suggestions.During the process of determining our signature cocktail, we tasted a number of Greenbar's spirits and smelled their homemade bitters.Over the course of 90 minutes, we honed in on a perfect cocktail, came to appreciate the unique flavors of Greenbar's Bright Gin and Vodka, and left with booze and a recipe to create our cocktail at home.I highly recommend the Cocktail for Lovers class or just a tour of the distillery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxG583
50,Class,Very fun and informative. Nick and Mimi were very knowledgeable and helpful. Felt a bit crowded causing confusion on which setup belonged to which person. They just need a bigger table!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhicksdc
50,"Unique, Educational, and Fun","My wife and I have visited Greenbar 4 times now. It's L.A.'s first distillery since prohibition and they make all of their products with organic ingredients, so they have wonderful flavors. The distillery is hidden in an industrial section of Los Angeles near the Art District. Greenbar offers two types of events, tours and classes, we've only attended classes so far. Each class has a theme and the staff, who are very knowledgable, give you some history in addition to lessons on how to mix different types of cocktails. Then, you are turned loose with lots of fresh ingredients to try your hand at making your own cocktails (2-3). This is not a bar, so you can't order drinks. You make your own. You need reservations and the events fill up quickly. It's fun and informative unique evening out. As a suggestion, make dinner reservations nearby either before or after your class, since there is no food at the event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesalerno
50,Great visit!,"We came here on a tour and had a great time! We decided to come here after buying a Groupon. The tasting was fun, and the employees there were great! I highly recommend coming here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsxjackie
50,1st Distillery in Los Angeles since prohibition!,"For fans of spirits this place is a treat. Don't be put off by the run down neighborhood, once you're inside the place is lovely. And they make wonderful: Bourbon, Vodka, Rum, Bitters, etc., etc. The regular tour is not to be missed, but if you manage to be in town when they have one of their occasional cocktail making classes, you're really in luck. This, of course, is not a family friendly outing, but it's fantastic for a group of adults. We've been several times, and plan to go again. And their Slow Hand Whiskey has become one of my go to's. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipmD1255YE
50,Great night out!,"This class was great. The bartenders running it were fun and conversational, the alcohol and drinks we made with it were good, and the whole thing was less than the price of 3 nice drinks at a regular bar. Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dyurk
50,Great for date night!!,"This is a great class for kicking off your date night. I went solo but I could see how it would be if I had taken a date along with me. I would definitely recommend attending one of their cocktail classes, it was really fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronkusek81

50,"Greenbar must be on your ""to do"" list!","Greenbar Distillery should be on your ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù list if you‚Äôre a local or visiting Los Angeles. Of course, LA is full of famous landmarks and tourist traps, but few capture the uniqueness of the city like Greenbar. I think it epitomizes what makes this city great. They blend fresh organic local ingredients, a variety of flavors that reflect the cultural diversity of LA, a progressive attitude toward spirit making, an amazing friendly staff, and a concerted effort to minimize their impact on the environment (they plant a tree for each bottle sold, among other things). I don‚Äôt see how it gets better than that.Greenbar makes an extensive variety of spirits and liqueurs, so there‚Äôs something for everybody. It‚Äôs hard to pick a favorite, but I personally love their Grand Poppy Amaro, a bittersweet liqueur made with California poppy flowers and other spices/herbs ‚Äì it is great straight or in cocktails. Their cask strength whiskey, anejo tequila, spiced rum, amber gin and fruitlab liqueurs are also fantastic! They offer a one hour tour (with tastings) where you‚Äôll learn about the spirit making process and how Greenbar got started (I love their story!) However, if you can catch a cocktail class, I highly recommend you do, they are so much fun! You‚Äôll learn the formula to a great cocktail, then you can experiment with all their spirits and fresh ingredients to blend and muddle into a perfect cocktail. I suggest you eat before the class to avoid getting overly tipsy, since you get to drink at least three cocktails - an inspirational cocktail (made by the staff) at the start of the class, and at least two others that you get to make ‚Äì that‚Äôs on top of tasting their spirits before mixing them. The cocktail classes are a great group activity; especially if everyone shares what they made, so bring your friends with you.The incredible staff will impress you with their knowledge and make you feel right at home with their warm friendly demeanor. The industrial neighborhood around Greenbar might seem a bit rough around the edges, but don‚Äôt let that put you off. I‚Äôve never had a problem there and always find parking near the distillery. The inside of Greenbar is so bright and cheery that you‚Äôll forget where you are. One quick tip, they only take credit cards, so have one handy to take some spirits home with you. They also have t-shirts, cocktail shakers, mule mugs and other items that make great souvenirs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marielA8101BV
50,Fun tour,My husband and I took the distillery tour on Saturday and had a good time. The two tour guides were both informative and entertaining. The distillery is in the art district and has that sort of 'hip' vibe. Best part is all the samples included in the tour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyL963
50,Be Still Mr Distillery,"We have been to several distilleries on Maui, and a few at Paso Robles. I am grateful that we have on here. Where have I been these past years? Green bar Distillery has been here. These people have some of the best Gins, Rums, Tequilas, liqueurs, and Bitters that I have ever tasted. They have a lemon flavored liqueur made with real lemons.....so good. My favorites are the tequilas....no, the rums...well, they are all great. It is right near 8th and Santa Fe. Not only do theses adult liquids taste so good, they are served by some of the kindest, nicest, people..who have a great knowledge of what they have e to offer. If you have not so, do it....book a tour, go to one of their classes, or walk in and buy a bottle or more. We are definitely going back......see ya there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daddy1020
50,We had so much fun!!,"Recently took a gin and tequila cocktail class here at the Greenbar Distillery. From a person who is completely clueless about Downtown LA, this area of town looked little iffy, and it made me nervous, but we made it there safely and after a little wait we were escorted upstairs to the bar area. The crew had this wonderful welcome drink for us, a margarita, which was delicious. The bar crew was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. The class itself was so much fun. We were able mix our own drinks and had so much fun doing it. The whole time the crew was there to help you and guide you. There was no sales pitches or pressure to buy thier products. A fun date night!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/784tinae
50,I hadn't realised this would be so interesting,"We had a lovely guided tour of this small distillery (although the biggest in LA) in the arts district. We were taken through the distilling process and learnt lots of interesting facts then, at the end, we were able to sample the different flavours of whisky on offer.. I didn't know there were so many. We particularly liked the Grand Poppy Amaro. All the staff are very enthusiastic. The tour takes about 40 minutes not including time taken to sample at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Otteraswas
50,Tour of Greenbar,I went here with a group of friends and did the tour. It is worth a visit especially for the price. We found tickets on Groupon for $15 each. You will learn about the process of making the liquor and be able to taste a few as well. There is something to sample for all pallets. The guides were personable and entertaining. They are organic and for each bottle purchased they plant a tree. Fun fact: It's the first distillery in Los Angeles since prohibition!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mistieb2017
50,"Great place, especially for a date!","Had a wonderful time here with the tour and cocktails! Bennett was amazing as well as Jenn. You can do a public tasting ($12) or a private. I suggest doing the private, call ahead, but well worth it. The spirits they produce are amazing amazing and if you are into the whole craft cocktail/mixology scene...this is your place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jfbg78
50,Worth a visti,"Found it on Groupon and have been there several times since. A fun small group tour and tasting of spirits and very interesting liquers like poppy, hibiscus, ginger, jasmine. Bitters and more. Cool place in industrial downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliebN6450DA
50,Natural and amazingly good spirits,"These folks are making organic vodka, gin, tequila, rum, and liqueurs with great skill and care. Many of them have great flavorings but all the flavors are natural and local, for example the orange liqueur uses real oranges grown within 100 miles, I believe. Go to their web site and sign up for the tour and tasting, by reservation, mostly on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8014LXbillb
50,Do The Tour When You Can!,"The drinks here are really amazingly tasty. Handmade, natural, and very carefully put together. I was surprised they don't use mixes for their infused drinks. They even have whiskeys that are flavored like tea; literally wood goes in a tea bag and soaks in the whiskey. Delicious!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiniStanleyGiraffe
50,The best distillery in LA,The guys at Greenbar are experts in their field with unique products and a tasting bar that is simply outstanding.Go for the slow hand whiskey with 5 different woods for flavour,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chillman73
50,Hidden gem Downtown,We came to Greenbar for a tour and tasting and had a great experience. The staff was all very friendly and informative. It's a small space with great story and has some great spirits! They really put a lot into their products.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackJack6
