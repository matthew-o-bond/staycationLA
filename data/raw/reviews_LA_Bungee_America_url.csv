50,"Bungee Jump on January 26, 2020","It was one of my bucketlist to do and I did it and I must say I had fun! At first I got kinda dissapointed coz I called them before hiking to bridge to nowhere and they didn't answer, but the day I went to the bridge, there you go they where there and right away I asked them if I could jump and they said yes and you don't even need for reservation. Thank you Bungee America!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elmamariel
50,Great Day of Hiking and Bungee,"While in Southern California on business I decided to spend my one free day hiking to the Bridge to Nowhere and doing some bungee jumping. I loved the hike, I loved walking through the cool water at the river crossings (especially on the way back when the feet were getting kind of sore), I loved the staff of Bungee America, and I loved the Bungee jumping! I opted for the 5-jump package, and would recommend at least three jumps if it is within your budget. The staff are fun to work with, helping nervous customers relax, but it is clear that while your fun if important to them, your safety is their absolute number one priority. From their careful explanations about the equipment and the redundant safety systems, to the repetition and double-checking of your harness and connections by multiple people, you only need to concern yourself with making the jump. They have already cared for your safety. The hike is challenging at times, but chances are if you are up to bungee jumping you are up to a good hike. And what fun would a five-mile walk on a flat surface be anyway? The hike is just part of the adventure. Came home tired but contented. It was a wonderful and fun day!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeanOldUncleJeff
50,Conquer Your Fears!!,"My teenage daughter recently expressed an interest in sky diving, but obviously is too young. So I looked for the next best thing, and came across bungee jumping off the Bridge to Nowhere with Bungee America. The day starts with a 5 mile hike through the Angeles National Forest. The hike is challenging at points, but the scenery is breathtaking. Along the way, there are multiple river crossings. It took about two hours to get to the bridge. My daughter and I both did three jumps....I would recommend doing at least two jumps. My daughter was the first person in the entire group to jump, and she nailed it!! After she knocked out her three jumps, it was my turn. It definitely got real once I had the gear on, and stepped on the other side of the railing. Each jump was thrilling in its own way!! After I finished my jumps, we made the 5 mile hike back to the starting point. Bungee America is a top notch organization, and it's apparent that safety is of utmost importance. Ron is very passionate about his job, and provided non-stop entertainment and words of encouragement!! Two negatives from the trip: 1) having to periodically stop during the hike so others could catch up; 2) there is a lot of downtime at the jump site itself. Even with those things, I would highly recommend Bungee America for an awesome experience!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbruegger
50,AMAZING Experience!,"What an amazing experience! If you're an adventure junkie, this is a must-do! It starts and ends with a beautiful hike. The river crossings were a new experience to me but very fun and refreshing, even in the chilling air. On to the main event - I did two jumps; one forward and one backward. I HIGHLY recommend everyone do at least two. The forward jump was terrifying and exciting all at once (mostly exciting); my favorite was the backward jump - indescribably fantastic! I never once questioned or feared for my safety. The jumpmasters kept us safe and maintained a fun and entertaining trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barymorton
40,Bungee jump off a California icon,"This adventure is a ""twofer"", combine a thrilling dive off a famous bridge into a flowing river with a 9 mile round trip hike through beautiful country. You will likely have the privilege of also seeing California big horn sheep. I have been twice and seen big horn sheep both times. Although it was my first time bungee jumping i did not feel unsafe. I intended to be an observer but when I got there and saw folks jump my adrenaline began pumping and I jumped in line. Guides were cool and understanding to those who were a little anxious (not me). I highly recommend this adventure, before you go check out the history of ""Bridge to Nowhere"" in wikipedia. This bridge is a CA icon - definitely a bucket lister.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawncarder
50,Staff are great and the experience was unreal!!!,"The staff and the experience was amazing. I was feeling fine until I stepped over the wall and was standing on the ledge, I looked down and all of a sudden I was terrified. Both Abraham and Nicole were great and didn't rush me, they continued to encourage me and on the second countdown I jumped. Its such an unreal experience and I am so glad I got the chance.The hike there was also beautiful.I can't fault anything about my time with Bungee America.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fionat631
50,Year round waterflow beneath the bridge,Chris and his team were really professional. All new gear. No rushing anyone and each person I saw had a great time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xumajoe
40,Adrenaline Rush Supreme (Better Than Sky Diving For Me),"As far as I can tell, Bungee America is the only place to bungee jump off a bridge in California. My husband searched high and low to find places to jump, and this is the only one he found of this sort in the state. We were thrilled California had at least ONE place to bungee. I can only imagine the liability to maintain this business. When I spoke with the Bungee America staff, they prided themselves in no deaths. I hope it stays that way so they can stick around.The experience of bungee jumping is beyond thrilling. I liked it better than sky diving. It provided multiple thrills each time I was yanked in a different direction. My heart was in my throat several times. It was one of the best adrenaline rushes I've had from an extreme sport.To get to the site, which is at the Bridge to Nowhere (now owned by Bungee America for the sole purpose of bungee jumping), you have to hike five miles along rocky terrain. It added some nice anticipation to the jumping landmark. After the jump, I just wanted to keep jumping, but unfortunately it was another five miles back to the car while the adrenaline died down and drained me.The reason I gave four stars instead of a five, was because of the first impression of one the guides, named Nicole. As she was setting up the check-in table, clientele were arriving trying to figure out who to check-in with (since it was not clearly labeled). Nicole presented a rude attitude and simply told people she wasn't ready for them. I'm ok with what she was saying, but not how she was saying it. She could have been more gracious and helpful. People were just trying to figure out where to go. She loosened up as we went along, but she gave off a tense energy, borderline unprofessional. Everyone else on the staff did a good job.Regardless of the rough start of the tour, I would go again. My husband and I had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ELHyman
50,Peak experience,"Bungee America featurs a bungee Jump off The Bridge To Nowhere, a Bridge built in the 1930s, in what is now the Angeles National Forest. A few years after construction the road got washed out.A bungee Jump professional bought the bridge and uses it to stage jumps. He really knows the craft. He once bungee jumped out of a helicopter, perched a mile off the ground. He calculated the precise length of cord, so that as he soft landed on the ground, he pulled a quick release from his harness, and walked away from the recoiling cord.His staff are experienced and focused upon safety. They are personable, humorous, attentive, and encouraging.You are in safe hands to confront your own innate fear of falling. And that is where the thrill comes in. Once you jump off, the adrenaline kicks in magnifying your own personal mix of fear, pride, thrill and wonderment. I have both tamdem parachuted and bungee jumped , and I find that the bungee has a greater rush. For both my 60th birthday, and again this weekend for my 70th, I treated myself to the 5 jump package (cheaper by the dozen). After the first two jumps, when they are assured that I will follow their instructions to assure a safe jump, they allowed me to experiment with front flips and back flips.Most people opt for the cheaper one jump, but if you change your mind at the site, and pay additional fees, you can add on jumps. One jump or many, you will be exhilarated and confirmed that this is a wonderful life, not to mention that you can take pride in your own daring.Aside from a five mile hike into and back from the bridge, it is an easy way to get a peak experience. And these are the people I trust to give me the safest bungee thrill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wchipatkin
50,A Must to check off your bucket list!,"I have done this adventure 4 times! and it always provides the thrill and adrenalin rush I expect!Chris,Nicole and Abraham.. thank you for all you do!oh yeah.. the hike is awesome also!ðŸ˜Ž",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lissette1962
50,Best adventure in SoCal,"Thanks Bungee America, this is best full day adventure in So-Cal. An easy hike to see a historic bridge in the middle of nowhere and then bungee jumping of the bridge, that is so amazing. The bungee America crew and instructors are doing a great job. I have done it 2 times already in 2 years and have tried all the different kind of jumps they offer. Let me break down the full day adventure.RegistrationThey only operate on the weekends and if there is a big group they also accommodate on weekdays. One thing I havenâ€™t tried so far is the night bungee jumping, now that would be so awesome. Camping for the night and then jumping off the bridge in pitch dark at night. You have 2 options of registering and paying for the jumps and hike. I like registering and paying for it before you start the hike online and you get a discount too on the jumps, I got the 5 jump package last time which costed $250. You will be hiking 10 miles so better jump more than once, I highly recommend getting the 3 or 5 jump package. You can also hike with the bungee America group by paying $10 fees and pay for the jumps on the spot but I believe thatâ€™s like $100 per jump. Also if you pay before you can finish all the paperwork before itselfHikeNow this is not so difficult hike for a total of 10 miles, 5 miles each way. You can either hike with the group or alone. If this is your first time I highly recommend hiking with the group or you will get lost. You can return by yourself if you finished jumping early. I have hiked this trail in fall and spring, and it gets hot so make sure you carry lots of water and food, as there is no food available on trail, though Bungee America does provide water near the bridge if you are hiking with the group. Please do carry trash bags as well, to avoid littering on the trail. Be prepared to cross atleast 5-6 small water streams, so wear shoes accordingly and if possible get an extra pair if you donâ€™t prefer jumping barefoot.Bungee JumpingThe most rewarding part about the hike is jumping of the bridge which is about 120 feet. Now they have 5 different styles of jumps and the most famous ankle jump, well first you have to atleast complete the basic jumps with courage and confidence then you are eligible for ankle dive. So they have 2 basic jumps superman front dive and backward jump, then the advanced jumps elevator drop, front and back lumberjack and the ankle dive. I highly recommend getting the 3 or 5 jump package. Do not just get 1 jump and pay for it online before so you save a lot. Bungee has excellent safety record, and they give you proper instructions before making that first jump, so get out there and start jumping and trust me you will have the time of your life. They have two bungee jumping platforms and they have categorized the jump according to your weight as they use different type of cords for different weight category.VideographyNow recently they have started to offer the video package where they capture your jump from 3 different angles, now if you are only visiting once highly recommend getting the video package, as the mobile phone doesnâ€™t capture the jump very well. You are welcome to carry your go pro and their camera angles are very well strategically placed for awesome videos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnuragS139
40,Bridge to nowhere,"The hike through the Angeles national forest is great. Be aware though that it is a 10mile round trip and there are a fair few steep ascents and descents as well as some river crossings so being in reasonable shape is definitely helpful. The scenery is beautiful especially as you set off not long after sunrise. The guides are chatty along the hike and point out any places that there may be any poison oak or anything else you might not want to touch!Once you get to the bridge you have your safety briefing which the instructors make fun, interesting and knowledgeable and then they separate you into weight classes and you're ready to go. Everything runs like clockwork and they are all really professional. Obviously some people get nervous but they are all really calming and they don't rush anyone.You have the option to buy photos or videos and the rigs they have set up to take these are amazing! It is slightly expensive but you definitely want a souvenir of some sort to take home.The only thing I was slightly disappointed with was that it wasn't as high as I was expecting it to be which obviously isn't anything to do with the company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amy270486
50,Awesome,Bridge to nowhere bungee was excellent these guys go out of their way to set up multi mediums for directions and information . Staff is friendly and considerate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seadweller80
50,Best part of trip to LA,"A few important things to know before taking this trip:- You have to be 30 minutes north of Azusa by 7:30 in the morning- There is no cell phone service starting just north of Azusa- You hike 5 miles to and from the jump, crossing water 6 times each way- You need to pack water and snacks for the trip- You won't be back at the parking lot till 2PM at bestOK, once you accept all that, its the best day you are going to have on your trip. The hike was absolutely beautiful, lots of great photo opportunities on the way. The staff are the absolute best, talked the whole hike, the safety presentation was given by Chris who might be a professional comedian on his off days, and they really made you feel comfortable the whole time. Their jumping gear was new, the bridge was covered from the sun, just an all around great day. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/John_Blackmon
50,"OMG, what an amazing experience",We were looking to take a group of 8 for a unique growth experience and we hit a home run on this trip. The journey started with a 10 mile hike through the valley from the parking lot to the Bridge to Nowhere. Our group guide met us in the parking lot and made the trek along with us. Upon arrival we had a bungee jumping safety class on the bridge and then the fun began.Each member of our group had an opportunity to jump 3 times (we booked s private group jump package for $1000). There are no words that can adequately describe the experience other than it was incredible. Each jump we were given the option to try different types of jumps which enhanced the experience even more. Our instructors were very knowledgeable and they take your safety very seriously. This is a first class operation and I highly recommend it to anyone who can make the 10 mile hike to and from the bridge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianm670
50,YOU MUST DO THIS!,"This was an absolutely amazing experience. By the end of the day I was so exhausted but it was so worth it.The day starts at 730. You meet at the parking lot. They weigh you in and give everyone arm bands. Then starts the 6 mile hike, which they told us was 5 but my pedometer doesn't lie. The hike is moderate. You cross a river 6 times. I wore old sneakers and they worked out just fine. There's some uphill climbs but nothing crazy. They break for 15 minutes after 1 hour of hiking. You finally get to the bridge at about 11. They divide you up by weight class (under 135, 135 to 185, and over 185) so that you have the correct bungee cord. Then it's first come first serve.They give you a few options for how to jump. I bought the two jump (and I HIGHLY recommend getting 2 jumps, not 1) and I did 1 starfish and 1 forward jump. It's the most exhilarating thing I have ever done by far. Make sure someone gets you on video when you jump!After you jump, you can hike back alone or wait for the entire group. Another 2 hours back.Seriously though. You must go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23maryannc
40,Bungee America For Christmas!,"My son got me this for Christmas as an early gift. Drove to the meet up destination, instructions and directions were on point! Took me right to the spot no problems. Checked in, staff was great. Wasn't aware of the 5 mile hike though, didn't know we were walking that far over some pretty rough terrain so be ready for that if you go. I wouldn't recommend for any people not ready or able to hike. Was pretty cold the day of and we had to cross the stream in some parts of the trail. Reminded me of my Army days. Once we arrived at The bridge to nowhere we got our safety and Instruction briefing which was excellent and funny. Then you have to wait for your turn because you jump by weight. The jump itself was crazy, scary, fun. You have the option of getting more jumps if you like it. They also record your jump if you'd like to purchase it, which I did. Pretty reasonable prices. Definitely a great experience for any extreme adventure junkies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7265SWrichardl
40,Thrill seeker!,"We had to meet up at a starting point early in the morning and walk 5miles to bridge to nowhere. As soon as the first person jumped, my adrenaline was already high. We were a party of 4 and due to my weight limit, I was the 2nd to the last to jump that ended way too late in the afternoon. At that point, I was already drained, cold and adrenaline all gone. After the jump, we had to hike back to our meeting place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q6591QGvincentb
50,3-2-1 BUNGEEEEE,"By far the most exhilarating experience of my life! I surprised my boyfriend and took him here for his birthday. He thought we were going on a hike.... woopsies? We both had a blast! I'll be honest, as a first time bungee jumper I spent previous weeks scared out of my freaking mind. Upon arrival, I asked our two staff tons of questions and they quickly made me feel at ease! They were super rad and made tons of jokes getting everyone hyped up.The hike is at a moderate level with some steep uphill climbs. It's 10 miles round trip so it's important you come prepared, especially if you're going in hot weather. We crossed the river 12 times total, and the water was a great way to cool off.The jump itself was pure bliss. I only jumped once after hearing the famous words of ""3-2-1-BUNGEEEEEEEE"", and I did the Superman Front Dive. Surprisingly, the experience was very smooth! Even though I screamed like a baby, there was no whiplash or uncomfortable feeling of any sort. During the free fall, I felt like I was floating slowly through the air. It was a surreal moment that I highly recommend.TIPS:1. Don't rely on Google Maps/Waze once you reach the San Gabriel Mountains! My directions were wrong and we were almost late. Make sure you bring the directions that are given to you directly from Bungee America.2. Comfortable closed toed hiking shoes are a must. They'll also get soaked so be prepared.3. Bring enough water to last all day.4. Bring lunch and snacks. You'll have time to eat it on the bridge and after the jump.5. Fear exists only in your mind. If you're going to bungee anywhere, this is the safest place to do it. I felt 100% safe and would encourage all my loved ones to take the plunge. Don't think. Don't look down. Just jump!6. Don't forget your go-pro/camera. This is an experience of a lifetime and the scenic trails are breathtaking.7. FYI if you don't want to wait for the entire group to finish their jumps, the staff gives you the option to hike back by yourself. Just make sure to follow the river and it will take you back to the East Fork parking lot.8. Our group met at 7:30 am (don't be late), and we made it back to the car around 3:30 pm. I'd recommend keeping your entire day free just to be on the safe side.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydlovestravel
50,BEST part of our trip!,"The Bungee America team is super friendly and just as serious about your safety -- which is a GREAT thing. They want you to have a blast and keep you safe at the same time.Few suggestions:1) The 5-mile hike is no joke... so be ready for it.2) If you can, choose the 6am time slot so you're hiking when it's cooler (at least getting to the bridge).3) Do more than 1 jump (the first one you're getting over the fear, the 2nd you're enjoying the ride)4) get out on the ledge and JUMP... don't hesitate and don't look down5) trust the team... they're going to keep you safe6) hang out to watch and encourage others7) don't go crazy snapping GoPro video and pictures of the hike into the bridge. Save your batteries for the jump.7) BRING water and snacks (and a bag to put your trash in)8) ENJOY THE RIDE!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IAmJen4t
50,Well worth it!,"I went to LA/San Dimas for this purpose only. It was superb!! Great fun, thrilling jump and a very funny crew... Not sure of the name of the lady instructor but she was quite a beautiful and charming woman;) Also if you have time, take your car up or down Glendola mountain road into San dimas... It is beyond stunning!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arfur81
50,Great Jump,"Chris the guide was on point with his joke. They double check everything and I mean everything twice in a super timely manner. The Jumps go off very rapidly and you feel safe the whole time. I had a great time and wouldn't pass up going back. The staff was excellent, the adventure was great, only caveat were the LA hikers. Come on guys, audio backpacks in the middle of nature, thats a little much.Seriously though, everything about the staff and adventure was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/960jessep
50,Biggest rush of your life,"Bungee jumping was amazing, I even enjoyed the 5 mile hike to get to the bridge and all of its beautiful scenery. I only paid for 1 jump but I recommend getting all 3, it's completely worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833derekc
40,Great Time!,"Let's start with a few cons and then all the great!Cons: Be prepared to hike five miles in and out. Bring snacks and water because it gets hot and there are many parts that are not shaded. I was not prepared for such a large group to be hiking out. I love being around people, but this being the case the hike took much longer than if i were to do it at my own pace. Maybe i am just a little impatient, but for anyone who is pretty active this could be a bother to move so slow.Only other con was the jump was not as high as i expected or hoped for. Still an amazing jump and experience, but for those who love a thrill keep that in mind.Pros: First of all the team and instructors are the ABSOLUTE BEST!! They love what they do are just hilarious! It was so nice to hike out and be around such fun people! I went by myself so they became my friends for the day! The equipment and set up at the bridge was amazing. They have a huge shaded cover which is nice at the bridge and the actual equipment is very nice (looks new). It was a great trip- they give you the option of waiting for everyone to jump (which would take a while) and hiking down as a group or they allow you to hike down on your own if you would like which i did- easy to find your way back if you follow the river!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jordanh501
50,Adventure people,"This was my first experience with Bungee America on 2.1.14... payment was simple online... clear directions to meet up location... had a great 5 mile hike in to the bridge to nowhere... the staff were very friendly, and absolutely hilarious... I laughed the entire day. .. and when we got to the bridge, the instuctions that were given had everyone cracking up ... im a scared of heights but but the staff made me fell very comfortable and when it came time to jump I did not even hesitate... in fact I jumped before he hit ""1""... lol. ... loved this experience and can not wait to do it again... Thank you Bungee America for a great experience. ..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kd1316
50,A great place to jump!,"This adventure is not for the faint of heart!!!! To begin with, there is a 5 mile hike into the desert canyon that is challenging for the average person. There are narrow trails on the edge of steep rocky cliffs and you have to cross the river over logs or scattered rocks about 10 times. We hiked the second week of September and it was 102 degrees or more in the afternoon. You hike into the canyon at 7:30 in the morning, but back out in the afternoon. Also, you hike out on your own and we got lost several times. The sun and heat were brutal on the return hike! The staff on Bungee America were wonderful! They were very personable and had great sense of humor, so they made it fun for everyone! Chris and Bryce were awesome!!! It was an incredible experience and I would absolutely recommend this to those adventure seeking people!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cinda10
50,Amazing!,"A friend and I were vacationing in Los Angeles and decided we needed some adrenaline infused into our vacation, and bungee jumping seemed to be the answer.We easily made our reservations online and while the directions were a bit intimidating (directions by mile markers) we had no problem finding the parking lot.It was a pretty good sized group, and it's an awesome hike out to the bridge. My friend and I both had 4 jumps each - I'd highly recommend getting more than one, because after your first jump you're just going to want to go again and again! The more jumps you buy, you'll also have a chance to do an ankle dive.The staff was great and helpful and the experience was one to remember! If you want a great (and safe!) bungee experience, this is definitely the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destree17
50,amaaazing!,"i actually thought bungee jumping gave me more of an adrenaline rush than skydiving did. i'd recommend this to everyone! they bungee america team was great and all of them were pretty cute ;P do more than one jump! if you do one, i'd suggest the backwards dive. if you get up to three, i'd suggest the third one be the elevator drop. i loooooooooved bungee jumping. and make sure you get good pictures. if you post a good one on bungee america's facebook and they choose yours as the photo of the week, you get a free jump! guess who got that? MEEE! :D the hike isn't that bad either. expect the worse and once you do it, you'll realize it wasn't as bad as you thought. go jump!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F1shst1kz
50,"Bungee-Jumping off the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was a Blast!","This past weekend, me, my husband, and some friends did our first bungee-jump with Bungee America, and we were not disappointed!My #1 tip is to go with the 6am group! Here's a couple reasons why: 1. There's still plenty of parking in the lot at that time. And after a 10 mile hike, at the end of the day, you might not want to walk another mile or 2 just to get to your car, that's parked past the lot.2. Its not that hot yet during the hike (important if you're going in the summer). We started the hike at 6:30 am and had shade until 9:30 (when we got to the bridge).3. The group to bungee is usually smaller. We had a group of 20& didn't have to wait at the bridge for very long.4. You can get back to your car by 1-2pm (instead of 5pm, if you go with the 7am group).Bungee America sells the $5 Adventure Pass for parking or you can go to any sporting-goods store & purchase it beforehand. The pass is important if you don't want to get a ticket!Bungee America was very professional in all aspects, but were very fun & approachable. When you arrive, you have to sign about 4 pages of waiver forms & you get weighed. Afterwards, the hike starts right away. The pace of the group & the difficulty of the hike is intermediate. You cross the stream a couple times. It was August when we went, so the water was only ankle or knee-deep at most.I recommend to wear:1. Hiking boots or shoes2. Non-wicking socks3. Cap/sunglasses4. Lots of sunscreen5. Breathable hiking shorts and/or your swimsuit underneath your clothing (if you want to take a dip in the cold stream, during the hot hike)I recommend packing:1. A camelpack for water2. Gatorade, electrolyte packets, and/or fuel gels3. Sandwiches & dry snacks4. Extra clothes & flip-flops to wear at the bridge while you wait for your hiking shoes to dry.Now on to the Bungee...Bungee America told us they have had ZERO accidents. When we got to the bridge, they gave us a little information about the history of the company, their safety standards, & the equipment they use (and manufacture themselves). Then they taught us how to put the harnesses on. Ron (the owner) & Chris were very funny, friendly, & helpful. Anyways, there are 3 weight categories: Under 135, 135-180, and 180+. The lighter jumpers go first. All jumpers get a helmet. One Bungee America employee will check you & then a 2nd one will check you. You can only go barefoot or with shoes (no socks) on the platform. Once you go over the ""invisible wall"" & onto the platform, they count 1-2-3...and you jump! For beginners, there's the ""backwards starfish"" and the ""forward superman."" For the qualifiers, there's the ""elevator drop"" and the ""lumberjack."" They let you add more jumps, if you want. They also take ""walk-ins,"" in case you were just hiking in the area & decided to bungee last-minute. A photographer is also there to take pictures of each jumper & the photo package is $25. Oh, yeah, there is also an ""out-house"" restroom at the bridge, that is available to Bungee America customers only. You can refill your water bottles at the bridge.The jump itself, was not scary at all! It was so fast, I didn't even feel the drop in my stomach! But the recoil bounced me around pretty good! For a couple minutes, you get to swing back-and-forth and enjoy the wind and the view!!:):)Please vote if this review was helpful! Thanks!:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bscsf
30,Bungeeing off Earth Weeee,I felt like I was above air and flying and was the captivator of my own kingdom. I was flying throught thin air. Great for adventures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OB01
50,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!!,"Bungee America is a GREAT company to go bungee jumping with! I HIGHLY recommend them!You meet extrememly early at Angeles National Forest, sign a waiver, get weighed, wait for everyone to check in, then you start the 5 mile hike to the Bridge of Nowhere. Once you are at the bridge, the guides (who are so much fun but also serious) go over the equipment, the dives and what is about to go down! They are extremely informative and are very cautious with everything. When one person puts the equipment on people and lock them in, they double check it and then they have someone else double check it.The jump was so thrilling! I paid for two jumps ahead of time and could've upgraded to more when I was there but didn't have the funds to do so or I would have. Many people upgraded to more jumps after they did one! There's 6 different types of dives that you could do. The ankle dive is only for those who have done I believe 4 dives and mastered the forward dive. I don't think anyone in my group did that dive! The dives I did were the forward and backward dives. Make sure you do as you are told. I put my head back on my backward dive which you shouldnt do (I'm a swimmer and thats how I do a backwards dive for the backstroke) and I ended up with whiplash for a few days! My forward dive technique was really good so I had no issues with that one!I was on vacation by myself so I did this with no friends. During the 5 mile hike in I made friends with 2 girls and a group of 4 (1 girl, 3 guys) so we all hung out after our jumps. The guides suggested if we had time to check out the river down below and go swimming!!! It was about 102 degrees out there so we definitely went down there. Be careful on the rocks. They are slippery!!!! One of the guys fell off the rock and broke his ankle!!! It was really gross to watch his ankle pop in and out! We helped get him to the bottom of the bridge so they could hoist him up on the bungee cord!!! It took us a long time to get him there!!!! He is a college student so he doesn't have very good medical insurance so he refused to get helicoptered out of there so we hiked him out of there 5 miles. The guides still had to clean up so we began the trek back to the cars (you can leave anytime after you are done bungee jumping, you don't have to wait for the guides)!!! Around the halfway point the guides met up with us and helped carry the guy out. A few of us went ahead so we could get the park rangers to meet them as far as they could go so they didn't have to carry the guy the whole way!!!Anyways, it was a great experience and the guides went above and beyond to help the guy out!!! I've made some friendships that I hope last a lifetime! :) I highly recommend this company!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lullabystar
