40,A Hidden Gem For Hikers & Campers Just Outside Of Los Angeles,"In May I made the move from Seattle to Los Angeles and it didn’t take long for me to start itching to get outdoors and explore. Unfortunately it took me a couple weeks to settle in and finally make time to get out. I started doing some research on recommended places to camp near LA and Henniger Flats was at the top of almost everyone’s list that I could find online. A short hike, free camping and not far from where I live; sold. Especially for my first camping adventure since making the move to sunny California.Henniger Flats is located in the San Gabriel Mountains near Altadena, California. Directions on getting there are pretty simple coming from downtown LA.The trailhead to Henniger Flats is located off N Altadena Drive. It’s not easy to spot but if you’re familiar with the area, you’ll probably have no problem finding it. If you’re heading to Henniger Flats for the night, you’ll have to pay attention to where you park because there’s not a lot of overnight or long-term parking at the trailhead. I personally parked down the street on N Altadena in the neighborhood. Just keep an eye out for parking signs and you’ll probably be ok.When you reach the trailhead you’ll see a sign that reads, “The Henniger Flats Project.” You have to hike up Mount Wilson Toll Road to get there. Initially it’s a little confusing to figure out which trail you need to be on to get there, at least it was for me. You’ll walk down the beginning of the trail and cross the white bridge. Once you cross the white bridge, stay to the left and head up until you reach Henniger Flats. It’s about a 3 mile hike and the incline gets steep at times. There are plenty of benches to rest at on the way up.There’s no shade on the way up so it’s important to start your hike early if you intend on camping and have a heavy pack. Also bring an abundance of water. There is a visitor center and museum at Henniger Flats, but there’s no running water. Be prepared! I didn’t run into any wildlife and you probably won’t either since the trail is very popular and there seems to be a lot of foot traffic throughout the day. There are a few signs for rattlesnakes but I didn’t run into any.After your 3 mile journey to the top, you’ve reached Henniger Flats. First thing’s first, you need to find the onsite LACFD Forester that’s on duty to check in. I read that you’ll be given a permit for camping and to use a stove, but I didn’t have to do that when I checked in for whatever reason. There was a cub scout clan doing some work at the campgrounds so I’m sure he was busy and distracted. After or even before you check in, you can check out the visitor center and museum to learn about Henniger Flats and the surrounding areas. It’s pretty neat.Once you get checked in you’ll have to find your camping lot. There are 3 levels of camping at Henniger Flats. There’s a lower level campground near the visitor center and museum. It seemed pretty busy, so I walked to the upper and Fiji campgrounds. The forester actually recommended the Fiji campground area for a quieter environment and great place for setting up hammocks. He was absolutely right and if you’re looking for a quiet place to chillax, Fiji is the way to go.Most larger camping lots have picnic tables and stoves to cook on. It’s worth noting there are about 15-20 camping lots in the upper and lower campgrounds. Fiji only has 3 camping lots, so you have to get there early to snag one. You can also call the forester head of time to get some insight on open camp lots. There’s plenty of shade once you get settled and the campgrounds are very well kept. There was no trash, the trails were well maintained and the views are phenomenal. There’s plenty of trails to check out after you get settled in.Overall I had a great experience camping at Henniger Flats and I will certainly go again.",Our Constant Journey
30,Close to the city,"It is by no means wilderness camping. But close to Pasadena, so what the heck. Can get crowded. And noisy.",Salvatore F
50,On the way to Mount Wilson we stopped for a sorft drink.,"On our way to Mount Wilson we stopped for a soft drink at the ranger station. Very nice campground. If you are in shape the hike from Eaton Canyon is not too bad. We continued to the top and explored the observatories on Mount Wilson. That was a long hike. Henniger Flats is a nice rest break,",Cavydad
50,Camping so close!,"Camped for one night with my daughter on a Saturday. Began our hike at 3 pm so as to avoid the hottest part of the day. Still hot, but many little shade spots to stop on the constant uphill. No switchbacks, but lots of gradual curves, going up, up, and up. We both carried 25 lbs. in our packs and used trekking poles. 3 liters of water in our packs as well, which easily lasted us overnight and the next day. As a reward there is an old fashioned soda machine (75 cents) in the ranger station offering coldish Coke, Pepsi, 7 Up, etc. Also, a candy machine for 25 cents.Upper Campground and Fuji are more secluded, off the trail, and quieter, especially in the morning when the day hikers start showing up. Lower campground is larger, and right off the trail, but with the best views. You can easily walk between campgrounds though. When we arrived, sites were filling up fast, so I asked the very nice ranger what happens when it fills up, who I have to go back down? She said no, there is back up campground without the views behind the ranger station. We loved being able to have a fire (in a fire box) and free firewood everywhere, so bring your s'mores. Several kids who made the trek up also having fun camping. The pit toilet is vile; more so than other I have ever been in. I suggest covering your mouth and trying not to breath in the stench. Horrible. That being said, still worth it. Also, very dog friendly. I felt bad for some of the dogs going up. It was hot, so bring lots of water for Fido.The views of the twinkling lights of LA were fantastic.",travlmama
40,Oasis in Pasadena,"Excellent (and not super-busy) hike up the mountain, ending with the Henninger Flats Campground which makes you feel like you're in a whole different world. After hiking through desert, you find yourself in cool, shady, pine trees with lovely views of LA (and--on clear days--even the beach).",Constance F
50,The Hike up to the flats is wonderful,My review is for the hike leading up to the campground from eaton canyon. It's a beautiful hike with spectacular views. Finally you are rewarded with an amazing view of the pasadena area and on clear days all of los angeles.,MrBalan
50,Great hike to get there,"I have actually never camped there, just hiked up in the morning, relaxed in the campground area and enjoyed the stunning overlooks, then hiked down. It is clean, well kept, and beautiful.",msa23_2000
50,Makes Camping Easy!,"We went here as a mini, ""try out"" backpacking trip for me, since I'd never been. It was about a 3 mile hike up to the campsite, which was not bad at all. We were so pleasantly surprised by the campsites…even though it was February, and getting toward evening, someone was staffing the lodge and checked us in. There were grills and firewood and bathrooms, as well as water. Everything was FREE! What else can you ask for? It was so peaceful, I think there were only one or two other families camping, and none in our particular site. I would definitely go again! Oh, and we saw a fox!",Joy T
40,You must be in shape.,"Hey, do not do this unless you are in shape and used to hiking. I don't know how long it takes a ""normal"" person but It took me 4 hours to get there and about 2 1/2hours to get back down. Very interesting place, read the history of the hill and the hotels and the observatory before you go.",Robert L
50,This place rocks,"The Forestry Service should be commended how they run this place, each year we take about 30 JROTC cadets up and assist in planting trees, and camping. We receive the Red carpet treatment every time and always build a great relationship with the Forest Rangers. Its a hidden Paradise",Opie T
50,Dry Uphill Climb,"It was a sunny morning climb a few years ago. There was not much trees but the morning sun kept you climbing to the top. It was not so strenuous. Along the way I met mountain bikers. picnickers & dog owners taking their dogs for a walk. From the top, you get a good skyline view of Los Angeles.It was a good workout for me. Good experience. There was a visitor log book where I stamped by visit.",carsam c
50,Nice view from here...,Takes about an hour to get to this point...once there great views and surrounded by pine trees....good place to rest and take in the view before heading upward as the scenery gets much better above...,Inoque1
50,Peaceful Getaway,"If you are a Los Angeles resident and want to experience the outdoors while still having the comforts of being close to home then this is your place! The hike up to Henninger flats is pretty strenuous so be prepared to bring beverages to restore your electrolytes! I usually take the Walnut Canyon route up but there are alternative routes if you go the the Eaton Canyon nature center and take a map. I have only ever taken a bus so please ask the workers at the Eaton Canyon Nature Center where you can park to get to Henninger Flats without getting a ticket. Also when you hike up there are benches for you to sit on and catch your breath while you enjoy the view! When my boyfriend and I finally arrived at Henninger Flats you basically sign in at the ranger station and get a free permit for the campground of your selection. There are three campgrounds in total with one right in front of the ranger station if you want to feel the safest and closest to the firefighters present in the area. There are fire stoves: OPEN CAMPFIRES ARE NOT ALLOWED! Firewood is provided for you so all you really have to bring is any fire-starter of your choice. There is also a restroom so you do not have to go to bathroom outside like a bear! And if you want ice-cold sodas, just go in the ranger station and you can get some from the soda machine XD. Even if you forget to bring change, the firefighters there can break your dollar. My boyfriend and I chose the second campground to the right of the ranger station and set up our tent there and got a wonderful view of the city. Usually there are not very many campers up here because people do not like the strenuous hike up so it's pretty quiet. Remember! Always boil water before you drink it and enjoy your stay! ^_^",Velexian
