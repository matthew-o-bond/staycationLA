50,Fantastic FREE Water Museum!,"This is one of SoCal’s best kept secrets for parents with young children! We were looking to do something new this Memorial Day, so made this our first stop on a somewhat whacky day trip.The Vista del Lago Visitors Center (I’ve seen it elsewhere called an interpretive center) is right in the beautiful Pyramid Lake! You get great views of the lake and the many boaters and water skiers below.Though it’s not called it, this place is a water museum. Since it’s free, I was expecting something along the lines of the King Gillette Ranch Visitors Center it the Placerita Canyon Nature Center... but room after room, this place kept going! Most parents of toddlers will appreciate the many buttons to push! There are some very fun activities too! There was a nice movie going that had large plastic animals the kids could sit on. There’s even an observation deck for even better lake views! There’s also a large theater, but there wasn’t a presentation when we were there. On the way out, kids are free to take paper hats, bracelets and more!A great place to take kids! Don’t get me wrong... it’s not Disneyland nor The Natural History Museum, but for a FREE Museum, it’s the best I can think of at the moment!There are many other things to do not too far from here to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bostonsavatage
50,Interesting,"Nice break from driving. It is located directly above Lake Pyramid. It is on I-51/2 way between Valencia and Bakersfield. Interactive items involving water and it's traveling thru the aquaduct. Very modern, attractive and clean building. No charge to visit and a great place to get out, stretch a little and a restroom break.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrynkathy
50,Beautiful lake,"During drive from Yosemite to Los Angeles, we stopped by at Vista Del Lago for toilet break. The lake view is magnificent. We can see many speed boats, jet ski, water sports activities on the lake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanChua33
50,Unexpected Excellence over the Grapevine and it's FREE,"I saw this building in the distance while driving north on I-5, which I never noticed before in my multiple trips each year. I admit I was looking for a restroom but stayed more than an hour looking & studying the excellent exhibits all about water & water distribution in California. Inventive & attractive with historic photos, the display was compelling & drew my attention for more time than I expected. I stopped on my return trip to continue absorbing & admiring the efforts of the CA Dept of Water Resources, the MWD of SoCal, and the US Forest Service to educate the public about water. The citizens of California are called on to vote for state & local water issues and this museum raises awareness of the complexity of water conservation & distribution issues with a historical context. I left with some interesting pamphlets & flyers. I will return to continue where I left off.The visitor center is open every day 9am-5pm, except Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day. Plenty of parking, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendoratraveller
50,Stunning Views,My wife loved the education inside the building. The displays make us retired teachers proud. I loved the views out back. The place is free. There is great parking for all size vehicles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bob19512014
50,Great stop!,"Everything you need to know water is here! It tell the story of water uses by people and farmers, California water system and its history and give a great rest stop over the Grapevine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N569BMsteveg
40,Great,It's around 2 HR drive from LA just off Interstate highway. Lake pyramid adjacent to it is beautifully blue: it has water activities for recreation. It's a small centre but arranged and specifically display of conservation of water and use of it. It has restrooms too. Good place to stop even just too enjoy the skyline.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rabi_Sharma
30,The site is closed,"A stop point one hour from LA. Great view on the lake but the visitor center is closed. There is some construction on the road, so the access road and all the area are blocked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/997jenys
50,FREE -- excellent museum worth an hour,"There are two videos, one is a feature length (in an auditorium with seating sufficient to bring school groups) describing the water collection and distribution throughout CA; the other is a scenic journey along the distribution and storage points. A handful of large exhibit rooms are exceptionally well done with many hands-on educational displays. You could easily spend an hour here. And, ih yeah, it's also a visitor's center with lots of info about things to do in the region.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Free,Nice stop obetween LA and Fresno.The kids had a blast in there!Its free and the restrooms were clean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaberg
40,Wonderful interesting and free educational stop right off highway,"Saw a small sign indicating ""water conservation"" venue at next highway exit so decided to exit and see what it was all about. Turned out to be a wonderful little CA Water System Welcome Center right off highway (literally 1 minute) and adjacent to Pyramid Lake. There were many wonderful exhibits explaining the water problems in CA and the way the state is addressing them. Very interesting, educational, and fun. In addition to the exhibits there was a theatre showing many different movies (we were told we could choose which one(s) we wanted to see. There was also a nice viewing area of Pyramid Lake.We spent about 45 minutes here and could easily have spent 90. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ams44
50,Great for a Quick Stop,"There is plenty of information here to keep you involved for hours, however I only stopped here for a short amount of time. The museum has numerous displays about the history of water transportation throughout California and is very informative and I found it to be quite interesting. I wish I could have spent more time here and I would definitely return for more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worldtraveler267
50,View of Lake is great!,"Since 'Vista del Lago' translates to ""View of the Lake,' we did expect nice views of Pyramid Lake. You have not only great views but there are also very informative displays about the lake and the areas surrounding it. This is a nice place to take a break from driving along I-5. You'll like the views!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuartGustafson
50,A free place to learn California water transport,"This is one of the three California water resource centers. The other two are at San Luis Reserviors (State Highway152 close to I-5) and Lake Oroville. This one is conviently accessed from I-5, with good and new facility, have a great view on Pyramid Lake.Seeing California canals near I-5 between S-152 & S-165, and also the big aqueduct from I-5 near Bakersfield, I am very interesting in studying the the clean water is transported in California, but was not able to find much information on it. I saw the sign at I-5 at 2012, marking this one as an education center, and found this site provides the information on California water system that I am looking for,I saw an exhibit on California state water project which photos the major components of this water system - dam/powerplant, pumping plant, aqueduct, hatchery. There was also a ~10 minutes demostration on the model of California explaining the water system. By now, I still think this is the best starting point to understand California water system.Look like the exhibit has changed. That could be a plus rather than minus to attract the people to visit again. Encourage everyone to visit. Also some small games available for young kids to play.I tried to review this place right after my visit. But my suggestion to list this place was rejected by Tripadvisor at that time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David2012C
40,Disappointed We Couldn't See the Exhibits,"This is a wonderful facility. It is located right beside I-5 at Pyramid Lake (exit 191) and serves as a rest stop for the freeway. The visitors' building is attractive with interesting exhibits about the California Water System, and clean restrooms. An outdoor patio overlooks Pyramid Lake and has more exhibits that explain about the water system, dam and lake. An exhibit in the parking lot describes the history of Ridge Road and I-5. I would rate this attraction as 5-star excellent, except it is only open 9am-5pm. There is a gate so you can't even visit the restroom or look at the outside exhibits when it is closed. Also, the adjacent access for Vaquero Beach on Pyramid Lake is only open on the weekend, so you can't drive down to the lake shore at this exit during the week. We were looking forward to this stop and seeing the exhibits, but unfortunately the security guard did not show up the morning we were there. The receptionist graciously let us come inside to use the restroom, but said she isn't allowed to let anyone into the exhibit area unless the security guard is present. I hope we get another opportunity, because it looked very interesting. The grounds and facility are wheelchair accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
40,Not to be missed,"You can spend as much or as little time as you want in this beautiful 18,500 square foot, Mediterranean style center. There are seven rooms of colorful interactive displays and a theater where you can pick from among 20 films. One you shouldn’t miss is Wings Over Water. It used to be shown in room four, but now it’s in the theater. It’s an aerial view of the length of the project set to music. Impressive.When we were there, some of the exhibits didn’t work, but many more did. The amount you learn depends on how long you want to spend. We were there three and a half hours and, if we lived in the area, we could have come back week after week and learned more. The staff is friendly and quite knowledgeable.There are restrooms, plenty of parking and drinking fountains, of course. Check out the view of Pyramid Lake from their wrap-around balcony and bring a camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artandroxanne
40,More Here Than I Thought,"My elder son and I had a weekend to ourselves and did some fishing and touring the ""local"" sights. After living in SoCal for 30 years, this was the first chance we had to visit this center.I was impressed. There was more here than I thought.The center is setup very well and focuses on historical as well as educational aspects on water usage. There are a few touch exhibits although most of the exhibits are more informational - reading or videos. All the exhibits are well done.Amusingly, one of the video producers must be a fan of Disney's ""Soaring Over California"" as the Center has a video called ""Wings Over Water"" that was produced in almost exactly the same feel and with similar music. It was well done and would look really good on a large screen!The view from the wrap around deck is spectacular and gives you a great view of Pyramid Lake. Bring a camera along.For Kids...This is a good exhibit for younger (< teen) kids as it has enough things to do and touch. Older kids may get bored although it's a great place to get out of the car, take in a beautiful view and relax.For Adults ...As mentioned, let the kids run around and stretch.Bathrooms are clean. Facility is really nice and quiet. When we were there on Saturday, Jan 18, the place had only one or two other families so we had the place pretty much to ourselves. More people were taking in the view than were in the center.There is no entrance fee and parking is ample. You could probably spend about an hour or two looking around and stretching your legs.Make sure to bring a camera along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls
40,Stop here for sure!,"Everything you've ever wanted to know about California's water distribution system. If you've ever wondered what all those cement rivers you see adjacent to Interstate 5 were all about stop here and learn.The visitor's center exhibits explain everything. There's plenty for kids and adults. The view of Pyramid Like is amazing from the visitor's center terrace.If you're driving along I5 in the area, take 30 minutes and check out this visitor's center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7268
50,You will go in dumb and come out smart,"If you are like most travelers, you know NOTHING about the vast system of canals and pumps that brings water from Northern California to the Central Valley and points as far south as Los Angeles. This museum will teach you EVERYTHING, not just about the California Water Project but about good old H2O itself. The exhibits are modern and enticing to young and old alike. As befits a museum with the name ""View of the Lake,"" there is a viewing area for the lake just below, a key part of the California Water Project, where you can relax for a while. Clean rest rooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnParleFrancais
