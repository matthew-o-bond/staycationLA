40,Nice way to see the area,Last day in Redondo Beach we rented 2 bikes and spent the next several hours riding the bike lane down to El Sugunda Beach on the far side almost to Dockweiler Beach is El Sugunda Beach cafe; no outside signs but has a nice beach area and really good food.The bikes worked good and you can rent a basket and lock. They don't prefer you go to the Venice Beach area and lock and leave as they have had locks cut and bikes stolen. We wore out before we got that far. We had not rode bikes for over 20 years.The hours are 10 to 5 so my 4 star is due to not being open earlier. Time of year we went it is dark at 5 so closing time worked fine.Great way to see the area and plenty of places to park and lock up the bikes.Almost forgot on the way back we stopped in the Hermosa area at the Waterman Safehouse for a brew and cup of soup. Another great area to explore.,SS_Forever
50,Great bikes and customer service,"Very nice cruisers, good helmet, basket, and lock. Also warned me about upcoming rain. Easy check in and check out. Highly recommend.",SherryK69
40,Easy process good service and advice,Arrived at 10am and was off on the road 5 minutes later after being given the choice of bikes.The trail is exceptional although navigating through Marina del Rey wasn’t the easiest.Defiantly recommend and reasonably priced with a good choice of bikes.,249wscotth
40,Great Bike rental!,Let me start by saying the people here were very friendly and helpful. We had a great time riding up and back to Manhattan beach. They do give you a basket and lock if you need one. The bike I rented unfortunately had a mechanical problem when I was out around manhattan beach ( the gear thingy came off) so I was only able to ride in 1st gear. I told them about it when I returned and they apologized and took a few dollars off. Overall a great time but I think the bikes could use some additional maintenance.,sagc333
50,Great time,Really enjoyed riding our bikes today. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Rode up and down the boardwalk.Great time!,Mike C
50,Best place to rent bikes!,"Only $27 to rent a 3-speed bike here for the entire day, and every bike comes with a basket for holding all your stuff. Beautiful area to bike around (you can bike along The Strand for miles). It took less than 5 minutes from when I arrived at the shop to get on the road, so it was a super seamless process.Tip: Bring cash because the shop charges a dollar extra to pay with card.",Emily H
50,Great bikes,"I went to other bike rental places on the strand and they only had those big, clunky cruiser bikes. And they were old! This place has actual hybrids that are really nice. The flat bar road bikes. The owner was very pleasant and laid-back. It’s a smaller place with less selection but the selection they had was good. Would recommend coming here over any of the bike rental places if you want a nicer bike. Not entirely sure that they had small bikes for kids but I didn’t need that this trip.",amdiaz
40,"Friendly, efficient bike rental to cruise the Los Angeles area beaches","Our resort recommended Marina Bike Rentals, and the recommendation was spot-on. The location is easy to find and right on the beach bike path that runs along famous beaches like Redondo, Hermosa, Manhattan, and more. The staff was extremely quick and efficient in getting us on comfortable cruisers. The path is an extremely easy to navigate mostly with some congestion in the mix of walkers, bikers, roller skaters, and more. There are speed limits and bike walking areas for safety. The ride is a people-watchers dream. There are bars and restaurants along the way; the bikes come with locks and there are ample bike racks along the way for easy pit stops. The bikes worked perfectly, and the staff recovered us quickly at our return with a cost that was very reasonable. I highly recommend this business if your want to rent bike to cruise the LA area beaches.",raharrington85
40,Marina Bike Rental....Recommended,"Landed in Los Angeles and rented a car from the airport. First thing we planned on doing was the Marvin Braude Bike Trail. Drove our car there and were thrilled that they had their own parking lot for customers. The staff were friendly and helpful. Their rates were good. The only negative I would say is maybe invest in a wider variety of bicycles. They have two choices at the moment. The 7 geared bicycle we hired was okay but the seats were slightly uncomfortable, however this could also be attributed to none of us being full time cyclists thus not being conditioned to a long ride back and forth from Redondo to Santa Monica. I would definetely recommend this place.",Edward S
30,Not warm and fuzzy:(,"Feeling happy and excited to be in California? Looking forward to cruising the Strand? You can do all of that by renting a bike here at Marina Bike Rentals..BUT...don't expect a warm and fuzzy feeling from the people that work there:( The cute dogs are all the cuteness you will get here...Pretty much sums it up, for our family...The customers leaving the business when we arrived were saying the same thing but we assumed they were dissatisfied with the service...No, it just turns out that these people have zero personality...So if you want a bright and shiny California smile...Don't expect one here...But you can ask the cute dogs and they will be more than willing to welcome you to California:) Woof Woof!",Valoha5
50,Great bikes for the money,"My husband and I decided to rent bikes while we were staying in the LA area. We rented the multi speed bikes as the lady said they were the most comfortable. She put on a basket on each bike and then gave us a chain with lock. She then gave us some options on riding.We decided to ride to Venice Beach, which was 30 miles round trip. We stopped at a restaurant in Marina Del Ray on the way and ate on the marina.The bikes were in excellent condition with nice tires and they were comfortable. My husband is 58 and I am 52, so we needed something that wouldn't bother our neck or buttocks! These were great.The lady was very friendly and helpful.Great place to rent from if you are in the area.",OkieHoosier
50,Easy Rental--Great Day of Biking,"My plan was to ride from Redondo up to Santa Monica Pier and back. That's exactly what I did and had a blast thanks to Marina Bike Rentals. I selected a Fuji mountain bike which was in excellent working condition. (Note: All bikes at this location are Fuji) Bikes come with a complimentary cable style lock upon request. All you need is an I.D. and a credit card and you are on your way. Free parking adjacent to shop when renting. Bike path is great--lots to see and enjoy! Stop at the Beer Garden in Venice and refresh yourself. Plenty of public restrooms along the way--you know, for the beers:)",Michael O
50,Fantastic,Great people and nice bikes. Very pleasant and easy to rent and return a bike here. Great ride up the hills in nearby Palos Verdes. Highly recommended.,tim757pilot
50,Awesome!,"We had such an awesome time! The bikes are wonderful, the prices are great and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly!",Sheryl D
40,Great place,"Easy transaction, very friendly... not the cheapest, if u start in Santa Monica there's groupons available for rentals there. As for this place there is nothing else in this area and it includes parking.",StonedTraveler
50,Friendly and helpful,My cousins and I wanted to go for a bike ride and neither one of us has been on a bike for ages. The owner was extremely helpful and accommodating in helping us try out and select proper bikes. We ended biking for 18 miles! Inspired to start biking again!,Edita_Stuckey
40,Did the Job,"I'd tried to book bikes here by email twice before we arrived - but no answer. They don't open until 10am, so we waited outside and were able to rent 3 bikes for the day for $90 (plus a credit car surcharge if you don't pay cash). I liked the owner and his helpers, but the bikes were a bit old, especially given that every other bike rental outlet we saw on our ride up to Santa Monica was cheaper - by up to 1/3rd. But the shop was right outside our hotel, and the ride up the cycle path was great.",MASBuk
50,Good place to rent a bike,"Took two bikes from here to ride the coast cycle path. I found it to be a good friendly place with people keen to help. The bikes were usual bike rental standard, nothing special and a bit robust but they worked with no issues over 30 miles that we travelled. Price was 30ISD a day.",Mikesalter
50,Great Bikes,Service was friendly and quick. Enjoyed riding their bike around the beach. Also got a trailer attached to put our little one in. We will be back.,BoghoE
40,Not cheap but worth doing,"Got there at 10am to rent bikes - beach cruisers for $8 an hour max $24. Got a helmet, lock and basket. Not the most cheerful of owners, but it was early. Fantastic ride up to Venice Beach for lunch (2 hours or so each way). Bikes survived - not sure our knees have!",rosbif
40,You must rent a bike!,We rented a bike (3 speed) and drove down the strand. It was an awesome experience. We will rent the bike for the full day next time. Great service. You must rent a bike! its so relaxing biking in the bike lanes and along the ocean. Incredible. We really enjoyed it.,Colette871
50,Best place to start exploring Hermosa Beach,The owners are fantastic! They rent all kinds of bikes here but they are fairly busy so if you're looking for something specific it's a matter of luck. They have a few stalls for free parking; we didn't know and ended up parking on the adjacent public lot for $2/hr.Their shop is towards the bottom end of the 20+ mile trail that runs along the coastline. There is competitive beach volleyball and a number of shops and restaurants along the way. Definitely a good place to start your day out on the beach. Highly recommended especially since the area is much less busy than even a few miles north.One note: our 5 year-old (who normally rides well) had difficulty with the high handle-bar bikes they had and I ended up having to rent a kid-friendly tandem bike.,mrdealfinder
50,Great to bike the boardwalk,"Hired Californian bikes which were easy to use, cheep to hire and comfortable, even for the 20 mile bike ride to Santa Monica. Family run business, a must if staying in Redondo.",Catfish2001
40,Fun on the Beach,"Marina Bike Rentals is a great place to rent bikes for a casual ride on the beach. Beautiful scenery, great bike path. The bikes are super good and a decent price.",tchermom
50,Fun Day,It was a Sunday on Memorial weekend and very busy at the bike rental. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There were lots of bikes available. We chose a tandem bike and rode to Manhattan beach and had lunch. They gave us a lock and a basket which I used on the way back when we stopped to shop at the Hermosa Beach Festival.,dogsdogs17
50,Great location,Located just north of the Redondo pier and just south if Hermosa Beach on the Strand. 22 miles of fantastic bike riding. Lots ok variety to choose from..,Jud J
40,bike hire on track,Location allows you to ride all the way to Santa Monica (19 miles) on the bike track.We rode from here to Manhattan Beach and back with a few stops for refreshments in 3 hours.Very relaxing way to see the beach area. Friendly and helpful service.,60jonno
40,"Friendly, quick service; good variety of bikes to choose from","For those that want a good quality bike to use for up to a full day to bike or tour the Pacific Coast beaches west of Los Angeles, this is a good starting point.It is strategically located right near the Pacific Ocean in Redondo Beach, easily accessible by car or with a short 10-minute walk from the #232 Metro bus stop.They have cruiser bikes, mountain bikes with varieties of gears and brakes. A modest chain-lock is included in the price. Ranging from $20. to $30. per day. You can rent by the hour as well.The bike path starts just 3 lights north of their location and on it you can proceed from Redondo Beach to Hermosa, Manhattan, Dockweiler, Marina Del Rey, Venice ... all the way to famous Santa Monica Beach.You can do all 17 miles in about 1 1/2 hrs of continuous riding but you will definitely want to stop to walk along the beaches, the piers and to take pictures of the ocean.",palmfronds
