30,"It was a nice beach, but I liked the beach is better which were further south.","Las Tunas Beach has some great views of the hills and the nearby vegetation, which includes gigantic date palm trees. The Pacific Ocean is just below you on the southbound side of the Pacific Coast Highway. There is free street parking, and many people are either walking or fishing. Still, I was a bigger fan of Santa Monica and Venice. Las Tunas Beach is a few miles north from Highway 405.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TennisStar602

40,Expect the unexpected,I caught this beach on a whim. We were driving north on the coastline on our way to Malibu the sun started to rise. I asked my hubby to pull over to see the sunrise. He made a uturn and pulled over in the side of the road. This was the best decision ever.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brisa1103
40,Worth pulling over for.,"Not sure if you can access Las Tunas State Beach from the road. We pulled over on Highway 1 to look & take pictures of the splendid coast line. There are some fabulous beach front houses there, but the beach looked as though it was very rocky.A stunning coast line though with fabulous views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72

40,Rocky but beautiful,Not as easy to access and parking was limited but fantastic in its own right. Great stop for us on the beach tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
30,Access closed till early fall 2016,"Las Tunas is just north of topanga. Lacks parking due to ongoing highway repairs and private homes north and south.PCH construction and riprap repairs and PCH protection started in the spring and should finish in the fall.Access is severely limited but further down or up the road are coastal access gates.If you get to the beach, it can be quiet and peaceful.Mostly rocky but sand at low tide.I like beaches that aren't crowded. This isn't crowded. Good sunset/sunrise views.Not for surfing or swimming due to rocky shallow waters.No lifeguards or services are available",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
