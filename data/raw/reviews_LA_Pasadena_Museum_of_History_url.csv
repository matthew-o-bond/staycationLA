50,Engaging account of the city and denizens,"A multitude of documents, furnishings, decorative items and art works are to be seen. Housed in impressive abodes, we got an interesting appreciation of the life of the well to do in the past.A tour was the highlight of the visit, hosted by a very good guide. It was great to see the beautiful mansion.",permia

50,Pasadena Museum of History's Something Revealed is Something to Behold,"Yes, it is a small museum, but the current California women artist exhibition Something Revealed is really something to behold. Some of the artists trained under the Hudson River School and it shows in their landscapes. In addition the curators from Maurine St. Gaudens Studio and docents are very well informed and sociable. I asked if there were any African American female art work and he took me to three paintings and one mask made up of cowrie shells and a wisp of blond hair. Their paintings and sculpture work rivaled some of the large museums in scope. This exhibit is being held over only until next Saturday April 13th, 2019 so you do not want to miss it. I also found walking around the grounds relaxing. You can tour The Fenyes Mansion, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but that is only at 12:15 only on the days the museum is open. I did get an interesting view through the estate’s window and think I may go back later this year to take the docent led tour.",Joseph C
50,Mansion + Jewel Box,"Do you want to know about Californian women artists from 1860-1960? Then go to this museum before April 13 when their current exhibit ""Something Revealed"" closes. Within 2 rooms they've put works by 120 different female artists including a woman artist for Disney. They have a well-stocked gift shop and give tours of the mansion in the early afternoons of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon!",GlobalGypsy_13
40,Worth a quick visit,"This small museum will take you less than an hour to visit. Its name, museum of history, is a little deceiving as the current exhibit on women artists doesn't fit the idea of history. That said, the current exhibit runs through the end of March and is outstanding. Tours of the mansion next door are only available once per day, three days per week.",jerryanddiane
40,A small hidden gem,"A lovely little museum. When we went recently there was an exhibit of women artists in California. It was fascinating and well set up. The museum is so small that it could only display that exhibit. It seems they own some other wonderful art works that we shall have to go back and see another time, along with the beautiful estate house that is on the property. The latter only has tours on weekends.",Anastasia3052018

40,Small musuem. Building depicted in tripadvisor description is not that of the history museum-but rather Fenyes Mansion,"Very small (2 room) museum with rotating exhibitions. We viewed ""Dreaming the Universe:the intersection of Science, Fiction and Southern California"" and my husband, the sci-fi nerd, was entranced. I gained (free) admission through a reciprocal museum arrangement. If I had paid, I would have been disappointed.Disappointed that the Fenyes Mansion behind the museum is only open for docent led tours for an hour three times/week at the cost of an additional $17 pp!. There also is a Finnish Folk museum that can only be viewed in conjunction with the mansion tour. I felt this was quite misleading.",sazoram
40,A surprising exhibition,"My Lady, a long-time Pasadena resident, had never visited this place, so we had no idea what it offered. Surprise! It was loaded with artifacts and memorabilia from the world of Science Fiction, which I delighted in as a teenager. The exhibits covered books, magazines, movies and TV, with the works of many well-known authors and artists on display. Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Chesley Bonestell, aand many other authors and artists were represented, and costumes of actors in Sci-Fi movies and TV shows were on display. It brought back many memories for me! Should point out that the Museum entrance fee does not include a tour of the mansion in which it is located; this is only available on a weekly basis, and you should inquire about it when you enter the museum.",DonaldYokum

20,Not what we expected,"We visited on recommendation of the hotel concierge and were disappointed. Instead of being a history museum (think British museum, Museum of London...) there were two rooms; one of which had a train exhibition and the other the CHALK display that happens on Fathers Day. We were looking forward to finding out about the history of Pasedena , to no avail.",Tracy I

40,The Batchelder tiles exhibit (through Feb. 12) is fascinating,"For anyone interested in artisanal achievements, especially the Arts and Crafts movement of the early 20th century, this is a must. (Even if you're not, it's fascinating!) Ernest Batchelder built a kiln in his back yard, and from there a business grew and its beautiful products went to homes across the U.S. (The Fenyes mansion next door is a companion exhibit, but it's open only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, so we missed it this time.) The museum store has a trove of books on Pasadena area history and more, with photos--worth seeing.",Elizabeth H. T
20,Not what we expected...,"I wish the staff would be up front and honest about what this museum is about. We expected to learn some historical events or factoids of Pasadena. Instead, we got 2 rooms - one with ceramics from different artists (most looked like a collection of Tchotchkes and nick-knacks). The second room show-cased a local company that made clay tiles. Visiting the 2 rooms took 15 to 20 minutes, at most; there was also a virtual reality experience. The large white home that you see in photo is not open to visitors but you can walk around it and take photos.",Traveling with T
40,A Small Gem,"The gift shop alone is worth a visit to this museum. They sell beautiful works by local artists and many books about the area.The exhibit I saw on Batchelder Tile was excellent. There were a good variety of samples, including a large part of a former chocolate shop in downtown LA. The video was interesting, and there was even a set of virtual reality glasses to get a feel for what Batchelder's house and early workshop look like (a little weird to use, but fun). I want to return on a Friday or Saturday to tour the Fenyes Mansion and the Finnish Arts and Crafts museum on the grounds.",LNLew
50,Special Find!,"Love this place! A little off the beaten path, this small gem of a museum offers perfectly curated glimpses into Pasadena's history and culture. We've seen a range of exhibits in just the past year or so: how the civil war affected Pasadena, local fashion throughout the decades and a really delightful collection of carousel animals.The grounds also feature a mansion that offers occasional tours (don't miss it at Christmas-time!), and (due to the site's history) a small Finnish cottage filled with engaging artifacts and stories. The museum also sometimes invites other organizations, such as theatrical groups, to create performances throughout the grounds.For me, this is a great example of good things coming in small packages. If you're looking for an eclectic and special museum experience, this is it. Highly, highly recommend.",AmyfromPasadena
50,Delightful Docent at the Historic Mansion,"Our tour of the historic Fenyes mansion was led by a talented docent who dressed in period costume and provided a lively, well-organized, and thoughtful learning experience. She shared personal insights about family members from the late 19th into the 20th century linked into societal facts from the past. What a great introduction to Pasadena history. A special treat was to visit the Finnish ""tupa"" (farmhouse) filled with authentic furnishings, a sauna of course, and pieces of folk art, along with insights about the years that the property served as the Finnnish consulate for the region. I'll visit again and bring friends.",dawnwalker66
50,Three Plays at the Pasadena Museum of HIstory,"This was a unique evening of following actors as they moved from scene on the grounds of the Museum of HIstory. Each of the three plays were the same length and the group was divided into three, each seeing one of plays and then we all convened at a central meeting point and joined the next group of actors. It was cool. It so happened that the Santa Clarita fire was raining ash upon is throughout the very hot evening.",D. N
40,The Fenyes Mansion is lovely,"The museum gallery was changing exhibits when we visited so we only toured the Fenyes Mansion, which was beautiful. Our docent was well informed and kept the tour interesting. I can't say what the museum is like, since it was closed, but the upcoming exhibit sounds wonderful. It's all about carousel horses and animals. Since we couldn't visit the gallery they gave us free tickets to return. The staff was very friendly and gave us several great tips for our time in Pasadena.",Albizia
20,Not what I expected,"The museum is small - 2 galleries, a nice gift shop, and the staff was pleasant. We paid our $7 admission each at the gift shop and entered to learn about Pasadena, perhaps the Tournament of Roses, millionaire row?, JPL?, local artists?, architects Greene and Greene? Nope. ""Welcome to our new exhibit on carousel animals! We're so excited that you came to see it. How did you hear about it?"" Uh, we didn't, just our dumb luck. It was interesting...there were a number of them. We were given a booklet describing each one, which was great - but we were told that we had to return them. That's ok, I didn't need to take it home. It was a fine exhibit if I'd known ahead of time that was all I was going to see. At the end of our 20 minutes we were told to enjoy the grounds - hot day - that the mansion was closed. I was really wondering in a surreal way what my $14 total admission was for seeing 2 small rooms of nothing related to Pasadena.",Theresa T
40,Worth a visit to see a well restored Mansion.,"This is a review of the Fenyes Mansion, but there are actually many buildings to see on this property (Mansion, Museum, little Finnish house and Curtain House). We attended a tour the Fenyes Mansion because we were at a private event at the little Finnish house in the back. The Pasadena Museum was closed, but we shopped at the museum store for chocolates and drinks. The Mansion was beautiful and recently re-done and worth seeing if you want to see an excellent restoration of a very old home. The kitchen was fascinating and had a lot of antique touches. The piano room was also nice as well as the floors and windows. We wished we could go upstairs, but that day was only a tour of the upstairs. The docents had stories of the Fenyes family that lived there and they were happy to show us around and answer questions. If you are in the area, and want to see this beautiful and historic home, that is very well maintained, we suggest you come and take a look.",WalkingInLA
30,Nice Visit - The Mansion is the draw,"This is the small museum on the Fenyes Mansion property.They hadd a interesting exhibit on fasion that was fun to see. There are two rooms perhaps 30' square each that were filled with nice displays and good information.We went for the house tour. The grounds are very nice - not opulant but worth seeing if you are in the area. The house is nice to see and filled with mostly original furnishings. The docent we had was nice but did not have a full cmmand of the information and had to use printed notes and information. She was also unable to be heard by our small group much of the time because she simple could not get her volume to an appropriate level.Having been on literally dozens of tours of homes I would say this house has a great story to be told and is worth seeing. However, be forewared that you only see the first floor. The second floor and basement are not part of the tour.We would have enjoyed the tour more if the docent had been more knowledgeable about things like the cost to build the home - normally explained on tours - that one expects & had she been able to cmmunicate with the entire group throughout the tour.We would vote for more access to the property for another $5-$10 per ticket and a well trained and proper docent.If your choosing between this and the Gamble House in the same area, we woudlencourage you to go to the Gambel house. Otherwise, the Feynes home is worth the time and cost.",David S
50,Wonderful tour of mansion and excellent museum with changing exhibits,"Excellent tour of the Fenyes mansion home to three generations of talented independent women and their husbands.

Well done!",gwens11
10,Waste of time,"I grew up in Pasadena and, visiting the town after many years' absence, was glad to see this museum, established after I had left. But it had nothing of a comprehensive overview of Pasadena. Two exhibits only, one about the Civil War and the other about Thaddeus Lowe. Interesting for what they were, but overall a great disappointment.",John R
50,We had a great time,"I have lived in Pasadena all my life and the first time I visited was on a field trip with my daughter school. Originally I thought it was going to be a museum about Pasadena's history, but this was not the case, don't let the name fool you. It is a mansion with great history, you are able to see how they lived in the early 1900s. What I loved the most was that the docents were local middle schoolers. And they allow you to take pictures. This is a hidden gem!",Normeee
40,Easy Access to Pasaden'a History,"This is one of the smaller museums in the Pasadena area. However, its size can be an advantage, especially when they stage exhibitions like the current one: ""When Johnny Came Marching West: How the Civil War Shaped Pasadena"", curated by local historians Janet Kadin and Nick Smith, and ""Thaddeus Lowe: Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army"", curated by Michael Patris of the Mount Lowe Preservation Society Collection. (April 22 thru September 2015). I got a sneak peak of the exhibition and particularly liked the ""Thaddeus Lowe"" exhibit. Michael Patris and his wife, Mudd, have assembled a remarkable collection of all things ""Lowe"". Pasadena would certainly have been a very different place without the influence of the famous civil war balloonist, Professor Lowe. The mountain railroad that Lowe build in the mountains above Pasadena was the ""Disneyland"" of its day (1880-1938). Hiking to the remains of this remarkable engineering feat is still very popular to this day. (See: http://www.mountlowe.org for a complete look of more of the Mount Lowe collection after your trip to the museum).",TerrywHamilton

50,"A Specatacular Home on old Millionaires Row, Pasadena","This is more than a museum, so don't be misled by the name. It is a huge, two story mansion built in 1906 on the corner of Walnut and Orange Grove Ave. which came to be known as Millionaires' Row.The rather extensive home was resided in by four generations on one family and was at one time the center for the Finish consulate. Eva Scott Fenyes (1849-1930) was a wealthy society woman that lived in Pasadena over 100 years ago. She was also patroness of art and the collection of early impressionist California art throughout the home is not to be missed. Her collection was left to the Pasadena Museum of History after her death.Docent led tours are $15 for non members and begin at 12:15 PM Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. Be sure to see the Finish Folk Art Museum which is also on the property and quite good.",Christie C

50,A Hidden Gem,"The Pasadena Museum of History has excellent rotating exhibits in the main galleries, but also includes access to a 1906 Mansion on Orange Grove's Millionaires Row. It was built by Eva and Adalbert Fenyes and has recently undergone a two year, two million dollar restoration. It is currently furnished with the original furniture and accessories from about 1912. So it is like going back in time. The Mansion is available for private tours on Thurs Fri Sat and Sun at Noon, for a fee of $15. (Which includes admission to the gallery exhibits) The archives for the City of Pasadena are also at the museum and accessible from 1 pm to 4 pm Thur through Sun.",GaleGDavis
30,Better To Visit This Museum For Free During MOTA Day,"Came here this past Sunday for MOTA (http://www.museumsofthea…) where admission was free. I am pretty glad my husband and I did not pay to come here because we were rather disappointed.The exhibit that was featured at the museum was ""I Do, I Do, Pasadena Ties The Knot"" where wedding dresses between 1850- 1950 were on display. As a newly wed, I found this exhibit to be interesting and the information provided interesting as well. As you go through the exhibit and see the different styles of dresses progressing, it really made me feel happy that my wedding dress was not of the same style, lol. But of course I still appreciate the fashion and history.But anyways, when we first came into this exhibit, a docent told me right away that I am not allowed to touch the dresses and take photos. She made me feel like I was a little kid as she seemed to have already pre- scold me before entering the exhibit. I know not to touch the dresses so I just thought that was kind of annoying that she had to repeat it to me twice... (and this was right before I step foot into the exhibit) and yet she did not tell the elderly people behind us about not touching the dresses... But I still enjoyed looking at the dresses anyway.Now there is the Fenyes Mansion that is here as well and that was a major disappointment. When we first walked to the museum, we entered through the gates and over to the mansion. We donned on our blue little scrub booties (to protect the floors) and walked inside. Inside the mansion, we were only allowed to see 3 or 4 rooms total, which was well, pretty boring. There were only a few docents around and so very little history was shared with visitors. As I left the mansion, I overheard a docent that they were not having a formal tour because of the large number of people coming for the MOTA day. So I am assuming that perhaps there are more areas in the mansion to venture to on any other normal day, but just not for the MOTA. But I doubt I'd ever come back (even on a free day).By the way, there is street parking in the residential area or you can try to park in the small lot they have (which was packed for the MOTA day, but doubtful it would be on any other day).",meowmix318
50,Spectacular exhibits,"We are members and have been there three times. The first time we saw a really great exhibit on public transportation , which included the mount Lowe railway and the fabulous rail lines from the past .Presently the "" I do, I do "" exhibit is well curated and includes wedding dresses from about 1850 to 1950. Many have been donated by the family that also donated the site and the Fenyes mansion.The dresses are exquisite and really could hold their ground against many fashion exhibits- like the metropolitan museum of art.Don't miss the Fenyes mansion tour- very limited times. Really interesting and includes a fine plein air paintings .Good gift shop, Finnish house if open and free parking.",lascola
40,Small but good,Love this little museum. They had a fabulous exhibit on the doo dah parade and also the trollies that used to exist all over Pasadena. The adjacent Finnish cottage was also open the day we went and was charming. Nice gift shop too.,lascola
