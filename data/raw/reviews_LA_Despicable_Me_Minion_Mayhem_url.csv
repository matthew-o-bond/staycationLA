10,Ruined,"Please, the guy who decided to take Out the 3D of this ride must be fired inmediatly... he ruined a perfect nice ride",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garcianegro1978
40,A fun 3D motion experience ride geared towards children.,"This is a fun 3D ride that caters more to children obviously but pretty fun overall for everyone...The waiting room right before you enter the ride has some pretty cool props to hit up on the gram before you enter. There's a mini movie introduction before you enter the room for the experience itself. It's cute and funny for all ages.When you walk into the ride room, you put on 3D glasses and sit in a motion simulator that seats 4. All the motion simulators face a giant screen that plays the adventure. The pairing of the simulator and the giant movie screen is on point and choreographed well. The 3D glasses didn't enhance the experience as much as I thought it would but it didn't hinder it either.The story theme is that the whole audience is turned into minions. You go through minion training and get caught up into an adventure with the kids saving a present for Gru in the minion factory. The minions being goofy minions really make this ride fun.The express pass is a must for this ride. If you waited a long time to get in you might be pretty disappointed as it's a pretty short experience overall. Get that express pass ya'll! Enjoy! =)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninong247
40,Little Kids Loved It!,"A 3D animated video ride, the little kids had a blast. Teenagers liked Transformers better. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misopiso88
40,A Good Fun Ride,If you love your Minions you will love this 3D ride this was really good as you are recruited as a Minion and after the ride you have a big shop where you can get all your Minions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianJ459
40,A fun ride and fun area,Minion mayhem is a fun 3D ride found in Minion Funland. The ride itself is pretty cool. Kids love it as you're recruited as a minion to help Gru. The entire funland area is such a blast. There's a door nearby where you can simply ring the doorbell and hear the minions reply (in Minion gibberish) to your doorbell ring. There's different replies with every ring. Check this out in funland. There's never any line for it. Its truly hilarious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/0221Serendipity
40,Racist,"The ride itself was pretty well thought out and very enjoyable. What took the fun out of it happened prior to the actual ride when they were handing out 3D glasses. I happened to be behind an Asian man who wasn’t even from the same country as me (i’m Chinese), and the staff handed the man two pairs of glasses. While I first didn’t know and held out my hand to receive a pair, she refused to hand it to me. I realised how presumptive she had been and told her we weren’t related. she never apologised for being that conveniently presumptuous. Instead, she just said, ‘that’s okay.’JUST because there are two asians queueing one after the other doesn’t mean we’re the same group. You have to at least be respectful of that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365nyssas
40,"Help Gru, become a Minion",A fun ride where everyone tries to become a Minion in order to help Gru with a big “job”.The girls are in charge of your training... of course the best laid plans do not always go as planned...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwj
40,MINIONIZED,As a fan of the Minion Run ipad game - this ride was basically the game but a full size imax version.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewbmusic
50,Great Minion Ride,Another must do ride whilst your visiting Universal Studios Hollywood. This is a 3D adventure. You’re turned into a minion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SixtyOne
30,More for kids than for adults,"The queue-length was around 30 minutes, and to be fair the ride was not worth the wait. Yes, it's a nicely animated ride, but really as an adult, i did not get any wow-factor from this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DjJassu
40,Great for Kids,"A great ride for kids who absolutely love Despicable Me or the Minions movies. Think of this like a larger version of the game ""Minion Madness"" where you run along a set track.The line was pretty long since it seemed that one of the two rides shut down and the staff had to readjust. This is a 3D motion ride as well, so keep that in mind!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaveDuff
40,Good fun.,I really enoyed this as I really enjoyed the movies. The minions are the best part. Good effects and 3d animation. Good for kids aswell as older folks. Long queue for it but it seemed to move along fairly quickly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve_In_Ulster
40,"Fun ride, just not a classic","Fun ride, just not a classic. I love the minions. Sorry, the ride is showing its teeth as technology is passing it by. It is in need of an update. Just do not remove the minions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,3D ride,It's a fun animated ride and is worth waiting in the long queue as it is always crowded. A must do at the Universal studios.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sachin_Zarekar
30,Story line is cute...,"So this is one of those rides that was carved out of a small space and relies on 3D Motion technology.The actual story line is cute but the ride itself is okay. You are basically sitting in a huge motion based theater.Front of the line access make the wait a little painless, regular wait time is upwards of 30 mins+. The actual queue is really neat. Once inside, you are inside Gru's living room which is full of eye candy.6 out of 10 if I had to score it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gcfam79
30,Ok,The kids enjoyed minions as they are familiar with them from the tv and movies etc the layout of the area is fine but as there is a lot of people around the kids can get frustrated,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51craigg
40,Good fun!,"I was able to ride this even though I have a bad neck. I used the stationary chair. Only one, so it was a bit odd, but the 3D was pretty cool. Watching the moving cars was even better.Worth the wait, and there was an entertaining pre-show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndyB336
40,3D HD Animated ride,This is an animated 3d ride that transforms riders into to minions only to be restored to humans again at the end of the ride. There are a couple of zones on the rides queue before you actually get to the ride that establish the story. The ride is extremely well done with both the animations and the action along the way. Typical Universal attention to detail. Worth the queue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OziDiver
