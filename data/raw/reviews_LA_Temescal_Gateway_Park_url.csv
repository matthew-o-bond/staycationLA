50,Canyon Running,"Absolutely loved this place. I did the loop up to the warterfall, then carried on making left turns which takes you to the top of the canyon and back down to the start. This is a great place to run, hard but great (260m of climb in a 5k run). The view at the top of both downtown and Santa Monica is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/golfingbruce
50,Relaxing ðŸ˜Ž,Is beautiful and relaxing clean and safe I love it you need to bring comfy shoes water and energy to walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pashmakmoya
50,Lovely location for nature conference,"Beautiful, welcoming venue. Multiple cabins among the trees; on-site store; variety of scenery; well-marked hiking trails; small stream; dining hall/ large meeting room with wooden floors; other meeting spaces; cooling and soothing tree canopy to beat the heat.This would be a great place for family retreats, weddings, or anytime people want to be out in nature and not far from the city.Parking is $10, but well worth it.I look forward to booking a nature event here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DevaPeace

50,Temescal Park - always surprising,"Living near Temescal Park allows me the unfettered opportunity to hike & Explore whenever I want, and itâ€™s always surprising. Enjoy Nature!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
10,PSA,PSA: Don't drive or park there unless you're prepared for $100+ tickets. The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority will photograph and video your vehicle so they may send you tickets in the mail. Tickets you legally have to pay. Horrible that this is allowed to go on while people are trying to enjoy nature with their families. It never ends in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lacev2019
50,Fantastic views of the ocean and the city,This is a great hike (Temescal Canyon Loop) to take someone to enjoy panoramic views of the ocean and the city from all angles.It is a great way to get closer to nature in the middle of the city. Highly recommend. Out of towners love this one and are always surprised to find it in the middle of LA.Be sure to pay for the $10 parking in either lot and definitely stop at the stop signs which are monitored by cameras (and bring 100$ fees if violated.),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsNinaG
50,great place to hike.,"First time here and started up what was probably a narrow fire cut to the east, so watch for the main loop trail. A little steeper and more rugged than runyon canyon. But no crowds and great views on the western path going back down Figure about 1.5-2 hours for full circle save $10 and park on Sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljsamson
50,I loved hiking here!,"My first time in Temescal, and I didn't expect so much! There are several trails, and my daughter and I took ""The Loop"", which a sign said is 2.8 miles. The wild flowers were so beautiful; I was surprised there were so many blooming. At the top is the most fabulous view of downtown Los Angelses and the Palisades mansions. It was so interesting how the vegetation changed from green trees on the way up, to scrubby bushes on the way down. I look forward to going to Temescal Park again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorettam55
50,Loved the hiking!,"First time here and trails are not marked real well but we followed the crowd and eventually figured it out. From the ground, the hiking did not appear that it would be so difficult but that turned out not to be the case. But we were awarded for the effort by some beautiful views from near the top of Malibu and the ocean. This was a great way to spend Christmas Day! There is free parking outside of the park nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
50,Awesome hiking trails. Great place for a picnic! All dogs on leashes please!,"My wife and I found this cool park in Malibu. We brought our dog here for a morning hike. Great location with many hiking trails for all levels. This park does have paid parking. If you are lucky you can find a free place outside of the park and walk in like the locals do. There are many green spaces for your pet, and they do have bathrooms too. We enjoyed our day and plan on coming back to take advantage of more trails. Thank you to all the employees of the Temescal Gateway park that keep everything clean and green!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yehbut
40,LA Hiking,"Over the years I have hiked several of the usual hiking paths around LA mostly because I love getting outside and being active but as an ex-pat, Western Canadian, I have always found desert hiking to be less like nature than the green and lush hiking I did in my younger years in Canada.That was until I found the hiking path in Temescal Gateway Park. This path gets your heart rate up, and even on a sunny day the breeze blowing through the trees helps to shade and cool off your sweaty body, (if you're anything like me,) as well as providing gorgeous scenery.There is a pretty decent incline on your way up the hill where you find a great view of the ocean, the hills and onto downtown. The path to the top, (or bottom depending which way you start), crosses over what would be a pretty little bubbling brook if we ever had summer rainfall.This hike is probably one of the prettiest I have seen in the LA area with lots of green trees to make you feel like you are in the kind of nature you always imagine for California.The parking is good and the foot traffic on the path is not nearly as busy as some of the other spots around, although I admit I have never been up on the weekends, so can't speak on that but, during the week, easy breezy.If you are a visitor from out of town or a local, I definitely recommend this trail, even though I feel like I should keep it a little bit of a secret so that it stays nice and quiet for me :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980raegank
50,June 8th visit.,"My daughter and I visited the morning of June 8th. We parked on Temescal Canyon Rd, just across from the main entrance to the park. Free on street parking. Unsure at first how the trail started, we ended up doing a loop hike, basically going counter clockwise from the parking lot and restroom building. It seemed like most of the people hiking on this morning were going at it clockwise. I am still not sure which direction might be harder than the other. So we went up Temescal Canyon Trail until it connected with Temescal Ridge Trail. We then made our way back to the starting point. I know there was plenty more trail to hike, but this was plenty fun for us. It seemed like there was more shade on the start of our hike, versus when we started our loop back to the starting point. There were some pretty decent climbs in both directions. We had a very nice time in this beautiful park. I would certainly return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia
40,"Steep, but worth it!","My boyfriend and I are very active and were looking for nice places to hike and see the city from. All our local uber drivers and servers suggested Temescal Canyon since it's the closest and a fairly quick hike. After doing the waterfall trail up to the top and the sunset trail down, I can say it's ""quick"" considering the altitude you reach, but still took around 2 hours to complete with stops. Bring lots of water, sunscreen, and a hat as our trails were mostly in the sun & its was HOT. The views make the whole things worth it!*sidebar: I am TERRIFIED of snakes, and there were signs about rattlesnakes everywhere. I thankfully never saw one, but did see snake holes in the ground as well as some skin. Just a warning to my fellow snake fearing friends*",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SarahSeestheWorld
40,Quick hike,Love this place for a quick hike before work or if in need of a nature fix in a pinch. Steep elevation gain rewarded with views of ocean and DTLA. Easy to find and plenty of parking. Hint:Park on sunset Blvd. To avoid $10 parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S9503BKmichaeld
30,"Nice trai, nice views, but...","We hiked the Temescal Rivas Canyon trail to Will Rogers today which was a nice trai and we had some nice views of the ocean and LA. There was quite some dog poop on the first part of the trail which we have not seen on other trails before.... but what we did not like was that once you are at Will Rogers you either have to go back the same way or walk 2 miles back to the starting point on Sunset Blvd or did we miss a trai back? This part was not a nice hike at all, so I can not give 5 points.Wear good shoes!It was nice that you are not completely exposed to the sun all the way, there was some shade too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rennmaus111
50,Great hikes with amazing views of LA & the ocean,"Amazing that this park is a 20-minute drive from Venice--and a world away! There are lots of trails, most of which are quite steep and will get you to the top of a hill with amazing views of L.A. and the ocean on one side, and beautiful green canyons and rolling hills on the other. There are some nice picnic areas, too, so you can make a day of it. All trails are well-marked and well-maintained. I highly recommend this park. Entrance fee is $7 per car, a real steal for a day's worth of hiking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWills10026

40,It's always good to hike...,"Iâ€™ve never hiked a bad trailâ€¦Some are just more fun!Temescal has many trails and theyâ€™re all well-maintained.Several of the shorter trails are dog-friendly---must be leashed. Please bag the poop and pack it out. Letâ€™s keep trails available to those of us with dogs.None of the trails have off-road bikers.Easy trails and good with families. While not quite flipflop trails, decent sneakers or trail runners are quite adequate.Trails can get ya some distance if you hike to hub junction, trippet ranch, etc.Hike can be an hour to many more hours. A mile to many more miles.Parking fees ($7) nuless you park on Temescal ourtside of the park and walk-in.It gets really crowded on the weekends/holidaysâ€¦",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Great views and work out,It's a great hike to the top but the views are worth the exercise it takes. Parking is $7 and tightly enforced. It would have gotten a five rating if wasn't for the expensive parking fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denandren
40,"Nice, relaxing place for a moderate hike.","Located near UCLA makes it a popular, busy spot, however it still has a lovely outdoor feel for being located in the City. It's a moderate hike and you will normally see other folks during the walk so safety is not an issue. There are really terrific views and it's worth bringing your camera or I Phone for some pics. If you want a longer, harder hike, head up the Coast to Malibu and try the backbone trail or conservancy trail at Puerco Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Wilderness in LA,"The hike from the parking lot at Temescal is heavily traveled, but it quickly gets you into wilderness along a stream that runs most of the year. It is especially nice in winter and spring when the wild flowers are out. The trail intersects trails that can cover miles in the Santa Monica Mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA

50,Nice escape from the traffic and hustle of LA,"While visiting my daughter in LA, we spent a day at this park. Before our hike we picnicked under the beautiful sycamore trees. Then we chose the hike up the canyon . It was beautiful and very serene! I forgot I was in LA quite Frankly! This hike gets a little steep towards the end and the trail is very rocky in spots so wear good shoes.A couple of notes... The park is 'dog-friendly' however the trail we were on did not allow dogs past the initial entrance.Also, you will need $7 cash to pay the parking fee. (An honor system)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiltonChick
50,Great Exersize,My daughter and I decided to hike the trail after she got out of work. The park is easy to get to with convenient parking. Just bring the exact change. Parking fee is honor system. There are bathrooms and a friendly Ranger on sight. The trails are manageable with a little effort. When we reached the top we were treated to an awesome view of Los Angeles and a beautiful sunset. Worth the trip for sure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64colleenm
50,A great hike with a breath-taking view,"There are several trails, i took the one that leads you to the waterfall, it is a great view and also a great exercise, and its free!

50,Beautiful Urban Hiking,"The park is conveniently located on Sunset Blvd in Pacific Palisades. There are wide trails, one connecting to Will Rogers State Park. There is a very informative kiosk and trail maps are available. There is a $7 per car day use fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MOG808
50,Some of the best coastal/city views in Los Angeles!!,"When I lived in L.A. I did this hike almost every weekend. It you just go up to Skull rock and come back it's about 45-60 mins hike, depending how in shape you are. If you want to hike for longer the trail continues up and inland and connects to many other trails so you could hike all day if desired. The views are stupendous of the coastline and city and I never tired of them even though I hiked this trail so often. I would not take younger children or someone who is unfit on this hike as it is quite steep on the way up. For free parking park on Temescal Canyon Rd rather than in the lot for the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzzieUsGirl
40,Beautiful,"Beautiful hike, easy for beginners. Some steep areas. Beautiful scenery. The drought has dried up the waterfall but still worth the trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrossfitCornerstone
50,Beautiful hike in the middle of the city!,"I used to live just next door to this place so I know every inch of this place. You forget how beautiful a place is until you move away. I visit here about 4 or 5 times a year and every season is different. You're most likely run into snakes in the spring. Winter is very green and beautiful with the waterfall rushing and the creek really flowing, especially after a rain. Summer is very dry here but still beautiful with sycamores and native chaparral still green. Fall you see a little color as the sycamores lose their leaves but nothing beautiful like the East Coast. The hike can be 20 miles or 2.5 miles depending on which trail you take. It connects to the Topanga State Park and the Backbone Trail so it can go on for miles. Overall, I love this place and have been bringing my 12 year old daughter with me lately. She loves this place too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonK935
50,Best views in LA.,"It takes about 30-45 minutes to summit if you are a moderate hiker and keep a good pace. It is a workout! Mix between packed dirt and loose rocky terrain so wear real sneakers. Do not go on this hike without water. Wear sunscreen, lots of direct sun exposure. There are breath-taking views every 5 minutes on the way up and the peak offers a 360 view of Santa Monica, Malibu, vineyards, and LA. Bring your camera, you will want to take many pictures. You'll see beautiful flowers, hummingbirds and lizards along the way.This trail isn't as busy as Runyon Canyon, not nearly as many dogs and you don't need to get dressed up either for this one. (you know what I mean if you've been to Runyon). The views are far more impressive also.The park is pretty big and there are lots of trails to explore. Great spots around the base for picnicking, sunbathing, or frisbee.Clean bathroom facilities available.Costs $7 to park, you must pay with cash. Abide all stops signs and the speed limit!!! There are cameras at all stops, you WILL get a big ticket if you aren't careful. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurarT9399JT
40,Nice Hiking Retreat Within Los Angeles,"I went to Temescal Gateway Park today, Sunday, August 31st, 2008. It costs $5 to park, and you have to use a self paying envelope.The Park itself is small but very beautiful. There are plenty of places to rest and enjoy a picnic in a scene that seems far away from usual LA city life.There are a few trails to choose from, all of which end up connecting in some way. The hike we chose today was going up the trail that leads towards the waterfall. It is a little over a mile to the waterfall.The trail was good for amateurs and it winded through the canyon along a dried up creek.The waterfall was non-existent, as expected, but the hike was still very nice. I wanted to go further (at which point the trail suddly got much steeper) but I was losing daylight (and was with my sisters, hence good for amateurs ;).You can look at my pictures to see what kind of scenery to expect. There is a great view if you take a longer trail or go further down the trail we chose.(I'll be there in the Spring)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kashberry
