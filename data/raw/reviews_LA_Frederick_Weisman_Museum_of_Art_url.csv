50,Unknown Gem.,"Set in the middle of the Pepperdine University campus, this 2 story art museum is great! First, it's free and that's always good. Second, they get some really fascinating pieces. The latest exhibit, California Dreaming, features California artists and California themes. You don't need a lot of time here. 2 rooms on the first floor and a smaller second floor are filled with some great choices. Give yourself about an hour. There's always a staff person on hand to answer any questions you might have. Exhibits rotate regularly so be sure to check out this one before the next collection comes in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman
