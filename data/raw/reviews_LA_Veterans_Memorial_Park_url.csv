40,Fun Park,We enjoy this park as a family. There is equipment for both toddlers and older children; space to picnic; ride bikes; and grass fields. My only complaint is the wood chips which make wearing sandals challenging.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kgo669
50,One of the best local parks in Southern California,Whether you plunge into the pool or go to the playground. This park has swings and slides and a friendly community of regulars who play together. Safe and clean. Many local organizations meet here for picnics and fun times.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MsAmandaGreene
40,Camper,We camped here one night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Felt like we were sleeping in a park more than sleeping at a campsite. Showers don't turn on until 7:00AM which was inconvient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdthebread
30,If you are in the neighborhood... worth a one time visit...,"Worth visiting the Veteran's Memorial building while you are there. I appreciate all parks, quiet zones, places that honor our veterans anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LightforthePlanet
40,"Great Park, But Wish They Had More Play Equipment","Veterans Memorial is a 1.5 area park on Overland Ave. in Culver City. The park sits right next to the Veterans Memorial Center, which is a large theater. The park itself, offers a wide range of features, including picnic tables, basketball courts, tennis courts, a play area for children under 12 and softball diamonds. This is a beautiful park with lots of trees for shade and great areas for parents to sit and watch their kids in the play yard.The play yard is designed for kids up to 12 and so states on signage at the park. There are some great swings and other equipment for the kids to play on. I do wish it was a tad bigger with more equipment.They also allow Birthday Parties, with a permit, and some areas have a BBQ. During the summer there are festivals there that can be a lot of fun. It is a very safe park and you will like it. Have fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
