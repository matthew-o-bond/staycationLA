Be sure to stop at the information desk first to talk with the volunteers, pick up a map, then watch the free orientation film. Afterwards, we opted to stroll through the grounds on our own. We particularly enjoyed the natural gardens, especially the orange trees, the giant fig tree, and the ancient towering cypress tree. If you want a guided tour of the grounds and the buildings, a docent will gladly lead you.",Kathy D
50,A GReat Bit of Little Hills (Cerritos) History,"Our docent gave us a pre-tour while we were waiting for another group to join us. We received so much information about the history of the area in that little bit of time. You must see the video downstairs to appreciate the original builders of this part of the country they created. The biggest part of the tour was the large complex next to the visitors center. Finally, we were shown a section of the outside wall where the original Bixby occupants marked their heights on the adobe wall. That reminded me of Pompeii where the kids marked graffiti on their walls.",Joseph C

50,Lovely afternoon spent at this lovely old Rancho,"Admission and parking are totally FREE!We had a most interesting tour with a docent who was very knowledgeable about the history of the area as well as the specific items in the rooms. The oldest room dating from 1840 was an office/bedroom for the ranch foreman. Other rooms included a blacksmith shop, the laundry room and living quarters for the wealthy owners. Each room was filled with items of the time many of which were original to the Rancho. Lots of great information put into context for the times and people like the Chinese laundry and cooks, the Basque sheepherders, the vaqueros etc and how things changed with the Industrial revolution. Really the most interesting place to visit. The house tour is about 1 hour and there is a garden tour of similar length as well. Definitely worth a visit for locals as well as visitors.",Rosemary P

50,Excellent way to get a little History into your day,"We had a 4 hour block of time to entertain our 3 grand kids...9, 12, 14. After stopping in the local Trader Joes to let them pick out some lunch treats, we arrived an hour before opening but were allowed to picnic in the shade of the lovely gardens. At 1pm, we started at the visitor center with a short video giving an intro to the history of the Bixby family. Well air conditioned, this was a nice break from the near 100 degree heat. Next, our guide, Brian, gave us a personal tour of the home explaining what went on in the ranch and giving the kids some insight into early California life. Most of the area was wheelchair accessible and I was able to see them at all times except when they went upstairs with my husband. Even then, they provided me with a notebook of pictures of the upstairs rooms and a brief description of the items within. We finished with a self guided tour of the back gardens with the HUGE Fig tree and the old cauldron I remember from my childhood visit in the late 1950's. Free, beautiful,historic and tucked away behind the Virginia Country Club, this rancho was a great way to spend a few hours. For wheelchair people, the dirt pathways are mostly usable but I did get stuck a few times and needed help from my husband. If chosen wisely, it can be done on your own.",Diane D

Learn about land grants and chaparral and life in early California. Not exciting, but Totally Cool! The docents are amazing!

The property has been lovingly maintained and provides interesting historical facts about the development of Southern California, Long Beach and surrounding cities. Our guide Martin, was knowledgeable, kind and patient with our many questions about the construction of the building and the uses of the grounds. The short informational film in the guest center provides a nice short overview of the history of the Rancho and the Bixby family's involvement in the development of the area.

Ample free parking is available and there is no admission charge although donations are welcomed and appreciated to maintain the facilities.",BoboTravlr

50,Where Long Beach Started,Long Beach was once two ranchos. All that is left is the adobe ranch house and it is great. The museum shows what life was like on a Rancho in the 1870's and after updating in the 1930's. A dedicated staff of volunteer tour guides will make you visit one to remember. Look for special programs at various times of the year,califken
50,Relive the world of Ranchos as California enters the US,"Leave behind you the hectic city as you drive thru Bixby Knolls past the Virgina Country Club and enter the world of the 1880's. Begin your visit with a descent into the basement of the visitors center to watch a brief film that brings you into the spirit of the place. Browse the historical exhibits on the main floor while you wait a few minutes for a private tour.Your tour guide is a docent, dressed in period attire, realistically depicting someone from the Rancho's past. The docent will treat you like an honored guest who has traveled some distance to visit at the Rancho.Play the role. A whole new world opens up.

50,The Living History Experience was Wonderful,"Tours of the Rancho are led by docents dressed in period attire depicting someone from the Rancho's past. There are many, so each tour is a different experience and perspective of life at the Rancho. You might have a family member or a worker. Our guide was Sarah Bixby, one of the family members. Besides the house, which is like a museum, there are gardens and a Visitors Center. The Visitors Center provides background information to get you ready for the tour. There are also items you can buy to support the Rancho. The Rancho is a bit off the beaten path, but well worth the few minutes to get there while in Long Beach. It's a nice un-commercialized place to visit - for free.",LongBeachUS

40,The Gem on the hill,"We did not have time for the whole tour, but as I am interested in vaquero history, a director asked a docent if he would show us just that part. The docent was very well informed, and showed me some things in the blacksmith shop I had not known. He also said that early visitors from Los Angeles were told to look for ""the gem on the hill."" It really is. Yes, you do have to drive on a road shared by the golf course to get there.",barbgal
40,Worth a visit to experience Long Beach‚Äôs rancho life,"Rancho Los Cerritos turned out to be an unexpected nice surprise after I decided to visit after reading about rancho history. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning about SoCal ranch life in the 19th century or how the Long Beach area came into being. [Note: this is a sister property to the Rancho Los Alamitos, also in Long Beach, about five miles to the southeast; see note below and separate review]After being in horrible disrepair in the earlier parts of the 20th century, the home (now a National Historic Landmark) underwent an extensive reconstruction to bring everything back to life. The home itself is not stupendous in terms of size or appointments, but the interior presents a very interesting and authentic display of how the Bixby family lived. The grounds offer a nice step away from the dense development in the area.Admission is free (donations welcome), but one can only see the property by way of a tour (just short of an hour). At the beginning of the tour, there is an introductory talk by a docent (sometimes acting as one of the ""family"" members), followed by a short film. It is fun to see all the rooms, and the docent takes time to point out many of the accoutrements in each.For your consideration:* If you‚Äôre driving from the I-405, go north on Long Beach Blvd., but turn left at Roosevelt (instead of San Antonio) in order to cut over to Virginia Road sooner. This route is more direct and allows you to see more of the residential neighborhood. The golf course you‚Äôll pass by looks like paradise (rather exclusive).* Parking is free, about 100 meters from the entry.* The tour begins outside the Bixby home. The group doesn‚Äôt stand still for too long, but if you‚Äôre sensitive to strong sun on a hot day, make sure you have a hat/and or sunscreen.* Photography is allowed (no flash indoors), although be careful not to linger too long in one place or you might be scolded for straying from the group. [So, you‚Äôre wondering how I know this?]* Check out the huuuuge Moreton Bay fig tree (planted in 1880) on the east side of the home.* TRY THIS: Visiting both Rancho Los Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos (even more amazing; I reviewed this also) makes for a great afternoon of Long Beach history. Since both properties are open only from 1:00 to 5:00, try to arrive for the 1:00 tour at either location, then venture over to the other rancho (~20 mins drive) to catch the 3:00 tour. I did this; it worked great.",Jim L
50,Great place,My wife and I live in Long Beach. I was born in L. B. We never took the time to visit this great place. We finally did and really loved it. It has a great story of how life was lived here in southern California many years ago. A time when few people lived here...imagine. These people were far from lazy or spoiled money people...oh no...they ranched sheep. What a cool tour that shows this and much more. Books are there on site to tell you more than you can get here. If you go you will be surprised and happy. I already want to go again. Too bad I waited 59 years to drop by...it s right in my own back yard. Thanks for preserving this history for all of US.,tripbhb
50,A rare historical find in Southern California!,"We have visited Long Beach many times but wanted something different to do today. We checked Trip Advisorand found this beautiful gem! We arrived at 1:30 and were warmly greeted by the docents. (Open 1-5 Sat. Check hours before going) Bob was our volunteer guide. A charming and knowledgeable local who recreated for us the lives of the Bixby and Temple families on this beautiful ranch estate from the 1800's. We saw an excellent film as an overview then were lead through the grounds and home which was beautifully decorated for Christmas! We saw the storage room, laundry, kitchen, foreman's room, parlor, family dining room, blacksmith, living area, bedrooms and the beautiful grounds. Bob explained the use and significance of each room and its artifacts. He also named every tree, flower and plant! We thoroughly enjoyed our tour and highly recommend it!

40,A little bit of Spanish history in the LBC,"If you have extra time to spare, take a trip to the Rancho. Long Beach has two, and they both have their charm.

What a gem!Our guide was in character from the moment we met him. He was Lewellyn Bixby and took us on a tour of the buildings and told us the history of the property and the everyday living from Lewellyn's time on the ranch. Even when we asked questions he answered in the first person. What a joy to have history come alive.The tour is free but please make a donation so that others will have an opportunity to enjoy the history of where they live (or visit)Note: in the main house there are steep stairs to the second floor and no elevator (after all it was built in the 1850's),napiligal

It is a popular destination of Long Beach school children",ryanroost
50,Don't miss Rancho Los Cerritos,"1st off my GPS system told me to turn right at the golf course but you need to go a little further down the road. If you need handicap parking it is to the right up the hill otherwise the parking is on the left and you walk up. I understand on weekends they have people dress up in the late 1800s and early 1900s. I would recommend that you call ahead to make sure you get on a tour. The guided tour last about an hour. We had Carol as our guide and she was greatest. Rancho Los Cerritos is only open Wednesday though Sunday, I can't remember the time but I think it was 1 to 5 pm. You can't miss with free parking and free guided tour. I thought we would maybe spend 30 minutes here but spent almost 2 hours. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!",Gene G
50,The birthplace of Long Beach and most of So. Cal.,This historic landmark is one of the most unique journeys you can ever take. This site is where one man and his family helped build what is today Long Beach. The Bixby Family took over ownership from Don Juan Temple and started raising sheep. You have to visit take one of the living docent tours and find out about the entire story for yourself. This is a must see and so critical to how Southern California became what it is today!

There is not a lot to see, but we enjoyed the relaxing break from the beaches and highway traffic.What blew us completely was the tour guide Nancy. I've made a lot of historic tours in ranches, mansions, missions, etc. and never has the guide been so entertaining, informative and made the experience so exciting.

Although when there are summer concerts and special events have the house open for self-guiding visits. House tours take about an hour, although if it is not busy the docents will be able to adjust the time frame to your schedule. Many of the docents are retired teachers and know how to keep kids interested. There are also costumed docents most weekends, now.The gardens are open for self-guided tours or garden tours on the weekend days at 2:30 pm (sometimes earlier, too).

50,A hidden Gem,"Rancho Los Cerritos is such a beautiful gem! Let me start by saying admission and parking is free, but they appreciate donations. We drove by a beautiful residential area and through a golf course before reaching the ranch. To really appreciate the history visit the Information Center first, where the volunteer docents are so friendly! ‚ÄúWelcome to Los Cerritos Ranch, we appreciate you visiting us and hope you enjoy your visit‚Äù, before I even closed the front door! Wow. The ranch (house) is closed, but the docents will open the house if you go to the Information Center first. Staff at the center were excited to share history and show us some relics on display. We were told we might want to see the 10-15 minute video (at the info center), which gave us a good historical review of the grounds. We really did enjoy the short film and even our 6 y/o son sat through the whole film. After the film, we walked over to the adobe home (with a friendly docent), where we got a wonderful 1 hour tour of the home. There are: multiple rooms upstairs and downstairs with era furniture, outdoors you will visit the black smith room, the food supply room and the ranch administrators room and see the beautiful garden and pond. You can end the visit by visiting the rest of the beautiful gardens with fruit trees, cypress trees, a multitude of flowering plants, watering tower and ‚Äúel orno‚Äù outdoor cooking area. Beautiful grounds, great history, with pleasant and professional staff and all for free. We were there a total of two hours. You can also have a little picnic at their picnic tables in the garden.

30,It was ok,"Went here with my son and it took us about 30 mins, to get around the whole place. We did not take the tour as they said it would take about an hour. I didn't get much information about the place from the visitor center as far as where to go and as there weren't a lot of gardens or anything. It was very pretty but wasn't really that impressed. However it is free and on some weekends they do dress up in period attire for the tours. They also have some family events on some weekends. Maybe it is better on these days.",Kelly P
