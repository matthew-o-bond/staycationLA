50,Old Hollywood,"Loved this - see the former glory of the golden age of the theatre - some tattered and torn, some still breathing. Great walking tour I enjoyed while travelling alone. The streets are quite enchanting if you can engage your imagination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaDefazio
50,Gorgeous Theaters,"A string of impressive historic theaters with great marquees and entrance ways. Some have been converted to other uses, some still theaters. Find a way to get inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TV2451
30,A step back in time,"It is definitely worth the trip and walk thru the Theater District - seeing all the old theaters when there was pride in construction, and a concerted effort to outdo each other in magnificence.Ideally you will couple the walk with an actual destination event in one of the theaters - look at the ""Last Remaining Seats"" program which opens the theaters for old movies, allowing you to step back in time and see the theater interior as well.While there, stop at Clifton's for an amazing meal, makes for a memorable day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackbH7422SM
50,Architecture & nostalgia,Amazing walk in more ways than one. Shame that the area is going to rack and ruin but good that the buildings are being somewhat preserved. Great to imagine what it would have been like in the 30s and 40s. Love this part of town!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timr889
40,Nice walk,I have walked through the theater district a few times and there are always nice sites and buildings to be seen. I can only imagine what it was like when it wasnt run down. Although it is a bit dirty and old you can still come see a lot of great buildings and theaters..There are so many of them!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
40,Awesome area to walk through,"Great architecture and ambience, you can really imagine how it was in the 20s. We didn't see any shows but the walk was enough. Parts of the area are pretty dirty and run down, but apparently the city is going to do it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Openfj0re
