40,Museum of Ice Cream,"Such a fun trip for friends, family, anyone really! Lots of interactive activities and tasty samples!",Amrita Sivia
10,Waste of Time and Money,"This place was a total waste of time and money. $130 for a family of three. They tell you the goal is to earn all of your ‚Äúbadges‚Äù, only to find out you get nothing when you do. The ‚Äúpool of sprinkles‚Äù is a shallow area with plastic tubes. The floor is sticky and filthy. You do get samples of ice cream. However, you can buy your own ice cream for much less outside. Tacky decorations, foolish games and an overly annoying staff. My daughter is 9 years old. She was crying when we left because it was so stupid and she didn‚Äôt even want to go in the sprinkle pool when she saw it.",Jason D
50,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!,I had so much fun taking so many great picture and memories to keep with me forever. I love the outfits of the workers and all the happy vibes they brought!!,Hannah

50,Awesome place to visit with family,Had great fun with family. Specially 4 yr old enjoyed a lot. They serve samples of sweet treats that are very yummy. Would recommend this place as a must visit during SFO trip,Ramya M
20,Not a museum at all. Barely about ice cream,"First off, this is not a museum, it's a place for people to take Instagram photos and try a little ice cream. Literally, you learn nothing about ice cream the entire time. Most of it is just art exhibits- giant popsicles, giant gummy bears, bananas hanging from the ceiling- and a few rooms have literally nothing to do with ice cream.You do get to try some things. There was one regular scoop of ice cream in the first room. Then you get a mint mochi, a couple gummy bears, some charcoal cookie dough, and then an ice cream sandwich thing at the very end. I did not need a ton to eat, but a museum of ice cream should be able to showcase more than vanilla and one other flavor.The art is cool and some decent photo ops (same ones every person in LA has now) are only reason not one star. If you want to spend $50 to take your picture in front of a big popsicle jutting from the wall, go for it. Otherwise just go to Jenni's or Ample Hills for some decent ice cream and probably more information about it than this ""museum"".",Colby H
10,wrong information,"i wanted to see the museum of ice cream and it ended up being something else ""cheat day"". this museum is no longer there. they moved it ended up being different price. staff was unfriendly. only great thing about this place was the monster coffee. Wonderful !",Anayüíúüó∫
50,MOIC is the best ever!!!,"Museum of Ice Cream is the best experience ever!!! It‚Äôs such an unique and fun experience, everyone should visit this museum üåà‚ú®üç¶ü§©",stephanieans1
40,Enjoyable experience and lots of fun!,Very busy (as expected) but nonetheless it was a really enjoyable experience and we had a great time. Lots of fun photo opportunities too!,Sophie_ScottJ
10,The Pint Shop - New York,Why do you make it so difficult for people to buy your ice cream?? This business of letting people in exclusively like you were visiting a Prada store is just insane for friggen ice cream.,Queen14259
50,Ice Cream.. Sprinkles.. Gummy Bears...Oh My!!,"My family and I just had to see what the hype was all about that we had seen through social media and scored tickets for a Wednesday afternoon...Parking was 6.00 per vehicle and very fast and efficient.So now, youre here in front of a pink Pepto Bismol looking building..Follow the sprinkles on the sidewalk because they're literally everywhere and you'll see that they get everywhere too! I love the spray painted ice cream cones on the walk up to the line up, which you'll find against the pink wall just to the left of the entrance. Theres a patio area to pass the time in with games like corn hole or connect four and even hula hoops. Great since we were traveling with 2 small kids who get bored easily.The greeters are super enthusiastic and will check your ID's and tickets prior to entry.After designating a cute group name (ours was Rainbow Unicorn), we get a complimentary Dove candy in the foyer. You can stay in any room except the sprinkle pool at your own pace, but you CANNOT go backwards.So off you go into various rooms....The pink telephone room, the beachy Venice themed room, banana room followed by banana swings, gummy bear room, mint room, etc.... Almost all came with samples of ice cream that the kids loved. Unfortunately, you werent able to bring your samples into the next rooms until you were finished..Our favorite part was just like everyone else's...THE SPRINKLE POOL!! ! We first put our shoes and purses in lockers. Then after some rules, we embarked on the pool and went ham on pictures! This was the only part of the tour that was limited but it was more than enough time to get decent pics and kids still had time to play in the sprinkles..All in all, a cute experience. Probably took about 45 minutes to get through the whole thing. Probably wasnt worth the 30.00 ticket per person (there were 4 of us so it added up quick) but was definitely worth the experience..",VictoriaAllen
50,I left my inner child here.,If Willy Wonka and a unicorn had a love child it would be the museum of ice cream. Wouldn‚Äôt change a thing ‚Äî well‚Äî maybe some more time in the sprinkle pool... yes. A sprinkle pool. Not a typo. Treats. Ice cream. Sprinkle pool. Mic drop.,Odyssey741802
50,WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM !,"Im 24 & I felt like a kid ! ! ! I flew from NC, just to go to this museum ! I was really impressed!I seen it on Kylie Jenner Snapchat & it looked so fun!Every room is so intriguing! You can taste, touch, and smell in most of the rooms !!I won't give away too many details because you should try it yourself ! New location just opened in miami and I am booking tickets for that one soon ! Each location has a unique touch!",iTravel4Fun17
40,Perfect intro to art for kids,As a mom I'm constantly trying to come up with new experiences to introduce my 9 yr old twins to. I have been seeing Instagram posts about the MOIC so when I heard tickets were available for an extension at the LA location I knew I had to get tickets and plan a quick getaway to LA.My kids really enjoyed the museum. Of course they enjoyed the treats but they also enjoyed floor to ceiling rooms filled with their favorite treats. The sprinkle pool was their favorite part but they enjoyed the entire experience. I'd love to see more of these types of museums as I try to introduce more art.,EHayes575
50,Fun!,This was such a fun museum and so different from a standard one. Very interactive and you get ice cream treats along the way!,Laura F
50,Such a cool experience!,This was a unique and fun way to kill an hour or so. In almost every room you go through they give you some kind of treat. The cotton candy pop rock ice cream in the first room was literally the best ice cream I‚Äôve ever had.They‚Äôre opening a new museum in San Fran and Miami. I would suggest anyone who lives there or travels there should check it out.You have to buy tickets in advance and they usually sell out within an hour or two. Sign up for the email list and they will let you know the dates and times that the tickets go on sale. Plan ahead.,JillianChamberlain
50,Fun fun,"The best attraction for the year! We got lucky that we managed to purchase the tickets in time because they had sold out twice!!!I did knot it was going to get big, but it's a fun place to go! You get free ice cream(s), candies, Gummies! And many sweet stuff more!!",Novia E
50,So Fun!,This museum was so fun for date night! A bit pricey but it was defineitely worth it. I plan to go to the one in San Francisco soon,DMR
30,Museum of Ice Cream & Instagram Opportunities,"Will you learn a thing about ice cream? No.Is this a culturally enriching opportunity for adults and children alike? Also no.Will you get a lot of great photos of your kid jumping in a pool of fake sprinkles, a pink mirrored room and eating samples? Yes.Will you buy her an overpriced poop emoji glittery sucker called ‚Äúunicorn poop‚Äù? Probably.Will she say that the day you took her was the ‚Äúbest day of her life‚Äù and then thank you a million times and go home with an upset stomach? YES",Trishyco
50,Lots of Photo Opportunities. Not for History Lesson Though,"If you are looking to learn about the history of Ice Cream then you‚Äôre better off researching on Google. If you are looking for a fun art exhibit about ice cream with lots of colored walls for your Instagram then this is a great place.A lot of the negative reviews were in regards to price and lack of educational value from a visit here. I can see where they are coming from since there are only a few facts about ice cream posted on the walls (under picture frames right before entering the sprinkle room).However, prior to going, we had the impression and understanding that it would be a quick tour of various creative rooms with fun displays and bright pics. It was exactly that. The girl I‚Äôm dating has been wanting to go so I came along to support her and since it looked fun. Plus tickets were hard to get and exhibit is ending soon.Overview: just know what you want out of your experience. If it‚Äôs purely educational then stay home, save $, and search google. If it‚Äôs because you like the IG photos you‚Äôve seen and want to take your own then I‚Äôd definitely recommend it.",NeoNorth
10,Total rip off.,"Old skid row warehouse that has been painted pink. For $29.00 I expected to get more than some corny 1 minute act from the person that opened the front door, a slow walk through a maze of dry wall, a scoop of Ice cream, 3 gummy bears, a sour cherry ball, and a very small soft ice cream cone of something. Calling this place a museum is total FALSE advertising. Nothing to see here. Would not go back if they gave me a free ticket.",RPVWilly
50,Big Fun,"We visited the LA Museum which is in an industrial part of the city. They let in about 30 people at a time. Tickets are hard to get and they don‚Äôt accept any sort of resale tickets. Tickets were $29 each. For folks who think that it‚Äôs about learning about ice cream -they‚Äôll be disappointed. For the folks who want the coolest pictures for their Instagram- they‚Äôll LOVE IT. You move through various rooms with awesome props... Bananas, popsicles, telephones, swings, ice cream cones and of course the sprinkle pool. Most people were wearing some sort of pink. It really makes nice for photos. Super fun. My friends are jealous.",diane q
30,An Instagram museum,Enjoyed seeing the art but really this is an Instagram museum and there is little information about ice cream or the art being displayed (just to set expectation). You do get samples along the way which is nice.The sprinkle pool smells like feet but that didn't stop me from getting in.Was a little annoyed that the only two things they say not to touch - hanging bananas and giant icey poles had people trying to hang off them or running through them. Some of the hanging bananas were tangled from people obviously playing with them.It is a fun visit but out of the way to go to. Purchasing tickets on the date they go on sale is must as it sells out quickly,nziv
40,Fun! Fun! Fun!,"The Museum of Ice Cream (Los Angeles) is a whole lotta fun! Numerous photos ops and lots of tasty treats! Don't expect to learn too much about ice cream, but be ready to enjoy yourself.",Ashley J
40,Fun For Instagram/ Social Media Photos,"The Museum of Ice Cream is a place full of great backdrops for photo opportunities. The staff was fun and full of energy, the snacks they served throughout the tour was good.",MsTangia
50,Check It Out For A Good Time,Not so much a museum as an art experience. We liked it a lot. Good fun. Good tastings.Great photo ops.,TravelinAlan
10,Waste of time,Don't go if you are expecting anything other than a photo opportunity. This place doesn't come close to being concise red a museum. There is no factual information at all. You are rushed around 4 mundane rooms where no information at all is shared with you. Then you are given around 40 seconds in a shallow pool of sprinkles. This is for instagram loving teens and an absolute waste of time for anyone that enjoys being intellectually stimulated.,prolificbackpacker
30,much ado,"This had the feel of a summer job project buy a group of enthused students. There was nothing informative on the history or raisin d'etre of ice cream. Oh well, the kids enjoyed the sprinkle pool and the sugar high!",riskmann
40,Fun outing with friends,The Museum of Ice Cream isn't so much a museum but instead a fun interactive exhibit showcasing ice cream and ice cream art. Lots of yummy samples to try and tons of opportunities for selfies and fun photo worthy shots. Fun!!!,Cheryl D
30,Hard to get tickets,"This place was definitely made for social media. Don't come expecting to learn about the history of ice cream. It's more about taking/posting pictures and tasting a few treats. Energetic workers and loved their music selection when we came. Overall, if you love posting pictures on social media then come check it out.",ImTropical
40,Very fun pop art with a side of ice cream,"This exhibit was much more fun than some have let on. A multi-room, colorful,Pop Art display that brings ""the kid"" out in anyone. Be ready for lots of photos.The staff, placed about the exhibit to hand out samples, were all upbeat.Kudos to all of them.Don't be inhibited by don't touch rules . . .ENJOY YOURSELF without doing damage, of course.L.A. is ending . . . S.F. Sold out, fast.Try to go anyway.",Trent W
30,"Interesting For Kids, More Art Than Attraction","The Museum of Ice Cream is located in an industrial area of downtown L.A., and it is more art piece than museum. Each room has a theme, and my daughter loved the pool filled with sprinkles. For adults, it's mildly interesting as art, but as an attraction, not that interactive. Not sure why tickets were sold out for months, so if you don't mind waiting in line for your slotted time to see some ice cream-related art, then take the plunge.",LeeTrotman
30,Triumph of marketing over substance,"Not the best art, not the best ice cream. I'm firmly of the view that any place that gets you screaming and shouting before entry does so because it knows full well that it dulls all critical faculties. Style over substance.",Robert B
50,Super Fun Museum,My husband and I visited the museum on July 5th. We had a fantastic time. The ice cream was delicious. They paced the tour well. I loved all the fun photos we could take. I highly recommend it.,Romad79
30,"Surprise, may be",This was a place I never knew existed in LA! Was a pleasant surprise when my kids planned a trip here. Not much of a museum but good photo opps in here. Needs to be booked in advance.,Mahakavi
50,Social Media had us at first sight!,"My 18 year old saw the Museum on Facebook. We were able to get tickets after they released the second session. I read about how quickly they sell out and went on website in first 15 minutes they opened for purchased. We had a great time from our first arrival and the grassy area to the end. This is a Instagram picture waiting to happen with opportunities at every turn. Not to mention, the samples were delicious!",Beachfamily2005
50,So Much Fun!,"Hard to get tickets but worth the try! It's more an ""art"" ice cream museum so if you're looking for the history of ice cream, this isn't the place for you. The 4 different ice creams you get to try are all great. Just go for a fun time!",juliebergman
40,So Much Fun,"This is a traveling time-ticketed event and I'm not sure where it goes from here. We went with family and friends which made it even more fun. There was 8 of us. It's not really a museum in a real sense it's just silly fun. Reviewers that say it's not worth it are just not into silly fun. You get a couple of samples of ice cream and that's actually why I gave it 4 stars. Could have had a few more samples. But it was a blast. Jumping around, swinging on swings and getting in the sprinkle pool. It was a riot.",MrsPickle
50,Insta-Perfection!,"After The Broad, this is my favorite spot in Downtown LA. That being said, this is not a museum in the sense that it's going to teach you anything about the history of ice cream. This is purely a modern art installation complete with samples of unique treats and incredible photo opportunities. The average person can spend 45 minutes-1 hour in here but since I'm a blogger I took a little over 2 hours.With the amount of coverage this place has gotten on social media, you need to get tickets AS SOON as they are announced. I've heard they extended their stay from July into fall so there's still hope that more tickets will be going on sale. It's around $30 per person and well worth it if you plan to stay and take lots of photos. Don't bother trying to buy tickets after they sell out on Craigslist, Stubhub, etc. because they check tickets at the door and expect to see an ID matching the name on the ticket.In terms of parking, there are plenty of options. You can valet in front of the museum for $6, find free street parking, or park in a lot on the corner of Mateo & Violet for $4 for 2 hours.The building is incredibly easy to spot- it's painted bubblegum pink. If you get there early, they'll have you wait in an outside field (there is some shade) with some fun carnival games.You are brought inside in groups of around 10 people. You don't have to stick with your group. You can spend as long as you want in any given room. There is only one room that is timed- but more on that later. Know that you can only move forward, not back- so make sure you spend all the time you need in any given room because you won't be able to go back into it once you leave.The first room you will enter has a beautiful wall lined with cupcakes and other pretty designs. There is a free sample of Dove chocolate in here.Then, you move into a all-pink room with old fashioned telephones on the wall.After that, you'll see the Hollywood room. They have celebrity names in stars on the floor that have been altered in terms of ice cream flavors- ie. Brad Pistachio, Vanessa Fudgens, etc. They also have cute wallpaper- pink and yellow palm trees, pink and white stripes, etc. And a Museum of Ice Cream mural that's a take on the Hollywood sign.Then, you move into the banana room. There is scratch and sniff banana wallpaper, a banana swing, and tons of pink and yellow bananas hanging from the ceiling to pose with!After, you move into the mint room. Here, you get to see how they are growing mint plants in chocolate soil! You can also sample a mint chocolate chip mochi.The next room is the rainbow room filled with a claw machine (unlimited free plays but nearly impossible to win) and rainbow murals to pose near.Then, you move into a hallway where you see different ice cream inspired shoes.Next, is the popsicle room. There are huge popsicles on the floor, coming out of the wall, etc. The only downside is they've blocked off part of the room because too many people have been touching the exhibit.After, is the gummy bear room. Sample gummy bears and pose with giant gummy bear figurines.Then, it's the charcoal room. Sample charcoal cookie dough and gaze at a wall splattered with ice cream cones.Second to last, it's the sprinkles pool! You are literally wading in a pool filled with millions of plastic sprinkles- so crazy! This is the only timed room. You only have 3 minutes in here so plan all of your poses beforehand. Also, it's not very hygenic as there are babies crawling in the pool so don't even think about getting your face anywhere near them.Finally, you exit through the gift shop. There is also an ice cream sandwich swing, a Museum of Ice Cream neon sign, a dripping pink ice cream bench, and a sample of a strawberry pancake ice cream sandwich. This was my favorite sample- so light and fluffy!All in all, this is a once in a lifetime experience. When else can you say you've floated in a pool with millions of sprinkles?! Go and release your inner kid :)",Sarah M
50,Pink and Full of Ice Cream,"This isn't really a museum, it's more of a pop-up instagrammable place for you and your friends to take tons of pictures. There isn't much ice cream to eat, they give you a couple of samples throughout. My favorite was the mint chocolate chip mochi. It was perfect for my blog and love of ice cream, AND a dip in the sprinkle pool (they are plastic, not real sprinkles).",Kat | The Sweetest Escapes Travel Blog
30,Fun Artsy Pop Up!,"This is more of a pop up artsy exhibit than a museum and an opportunity to try different kinds of ice cream in fun photo ops. Definitely great social media pictures, but I'm not really sure it was worth the steep $28 bucks a ticket.Tip: there's a small parking lot where you can park for $4 or just grab a spot on the street.",renakashmere
20,Total waste of money,"This exhibit doesn't work on any level:- It isn't a ""museum"" where you'll learn anything about the history of ice cream, or even any interesting trivia. Ice cream was invented in China 3,000 years ago-- that's all I learned so now you don't have to buy a ticket.- You don't get to try much ice cream. 1/2 a mini-scoop of Salt & Straw. I could have gone to Larchmont Blvd, paid a lot less, and got a full mini-scoop. That and 1/2 a mochi (yes, someone bothered to cut a mochi in half) and that's it. Oh, and a few gummy bears and a small piece of Dove bar dark chocolate. And and a small cone of cookie dough made up to look like ice cream but it isn't.- Not art worth seeing. Just a bunch of painted walls and uninteresting sculptures.- Not an interesting ""experience"". Sitting in a bunch of plastic sprinkles is just not that interesting, not even for the kids that were in the ""pool"" with us.Save your money and spend it on something else.",lrncole
40,Fun night out,"We visited the museum last night & was such a fun time!! The balance of art & fun was such a cool perspective on what a museum can actually be & how ""art"" can be so much more interactive! Huge shout out to the energetic staff throughout truly helped shape the experience! Highly recommended experience if you can get tickets while it's in town.",Scottys_explorations
40,Great way to enjoy ice cream,Great art and great fun ..many varied displays concerning ice cream .Tastetesting also included ... great for kids too,rickcardo
