50,Great place to see a show,"Good acting, fun shows, friendly cafe to relax in before the show, very wide and comfortable seats, easy parking, and amazing sight lines from any angle with a thrust stage that puts you in the action. Prices are affordable and easy to buy tickets online. Only 5 rows so you are close to the action.... this may be my new favorite theater!",Scott H
50,Wonderful venue and great production values,I had the joy of seeing the finalnight of a wonderfully directed and acted play in the studio theater last night. The tickets were bought last minute but one could hear and see from all seats. The acting and the play was noteworthy and moving. Especially commendable was robin Harrisonâ€™s performance all seats were comfortable and ticket prices extremely affordable. I will go to another production there. !!,Jeffrey S
40,Best Community Theatre in Long Beach,We saw Sherlock Holmes:The Spider Web. It was an intriguing play involving the famous detective duo of Holmes and Watson sprinkled with many plot twists. The cast did a lovely job and the set was very period as were the costumes. The Playhouse is an older building so the lines for the restrooms were long during intermission. Be sure to go before the show! The parking lot fills up quickly so arrive 30 minutes before the show otherwise you will need to find street parking. The theatre has a thrust stage which means there really aren't any bad seats. You are usually only three rows from the actors at most! I would recommend this theatre for a very pleasant night out!,amgundry2018
50,Local threatre,We were there to see Seven Guitars. A wonderfully play by August Wilson. The play house is small so you great the feeling of being right there in it all. The play was so interesting about a musician called Floyd (schoolboy) Barton. A wonderfully performance by all.,margaret c
50,Wonderful Experience,"Wonderful little playhouse in Long Beach! We usually drive a little over an hour to get here, and we always enjoy the plays. It's a small theater, but they provide hot drinks and they are always extremely friendly. I can't wait to come back!",Janelle A
40,You'll be glad you went there.,"I happen to be a theater professional in another city, and I can't help being envious of this venue. The main-stage seating is three-quarters around and only 5 rows deep, so the intimacy is part of the fun. Upstairs, there is a studio theater, where another audience can be enjoying another production. The lobby has a charming piano bar, plus an indoor-outdoor layout. I left with exciting ideas on how to improve my own theatrical venue.",Kathy D
40,Intimate theater with piano bar before play and during intermission,"Long Beach Playhouse is one of my favorite theaters. The seating is in a u-shape with only five rows deep on any side. This gives you an up-close and intimate theater experience. Every play I've seen there has been an enjoyable night out. I especially enjoy when they present musicals. Playhouse is also a good community supporter, working with several charities and helping raise money for local nonprofits in town. Last month we really enjoyed the Guys and Dolls performance to benefit local animal nonprofits. The piano player was wonderful pre-play and during intermission and got several of us to sing.",TrinaSchoon
50,First Time,"We have a friend who was in a play so we decided to go; the production was great, location was easy to get to; and the venue was really quite sweet. Intimate (probably holds 100 people) and a nice place to see a play. Would go back again",Cynthia C
40,Theater Without Having to Fight Los Angeles Traffic,"We saw The Hound of the Baskervilles, a play based on a Sherlock Holmes story, although Dr. Watson had a larger role than Sherlock in this one. The seating in the theater was such that everyone had a good seat and was pretty close to the stage. I liked the theater's lay-out; not too large and not too small. It was a good setting for a community theater. They did not have much to offer snack-wise during intermission; it was mostly junk food, so make sure you eat a decent meal before the play. All-in-all, I would say we had a very good experience and would go back again.",patty49er
50,Great Job on How to Succeed in Business...,With peninsula seating (similar to theatre in the round) we wondered how they would pull it off butthe cast did a terrific job on this play. We attend plays all around the Orange County area and thissmall theatre was intimate but delivered in a big way. Kudos to everyone involved. We will be back.,Lighthouse2006
50,Great theater experience!,You are never more than 4 rows from the stage (talking about the main stage ). The talent is great and the play selection generally fantastic. That combination ensures that you are totally engaged and delighted. Just saw How to Succeed in Business. Don't miss it.,Sam S
40,Little things mean alot....,The talent at this small theater is really amazing! Many visits and have been impressed by all of the plays in both talent and production. Customer appreciation however is lacking... no stand out performance in this area.,MominOC
40,Pscho Beach Party,"Funny well done play about a young woman who has multiple personality disorder. Without disrespecting the diagnoses, the play is humorous and insightful. All of the actors inhabit their roles well demonstrating an excellent sense of timing.The choreography in the fight scene is well executed with exact timing to the strobe light. Great lighting set up and cues.The theater itself is comfortable with every seat ""a good seat"".The theater is on the second floor. There is no elevator so anyone who has ambulatory issues may want to look at the staircase prior to ticket purchase to be sure going up the staircase is feasible.",Cynthera
50,Best talent in town,"I am very happy we have this wonderful little theater in our city. I cannot believe this theater has had 85 (yes eighty-five) years of non-stop showing plays. WOW!I am amazed of the good talent and the truth-to-scrip the performances are. I (almost) feel guilty paying so little.I love how intimate and comfortable the place is. All seats are good seats! I will even suggest a last minute walk to the ticket window. You will have a great experience -way better than a regular movie theater -for almost the same amount of money. Trust me your date will appreciate the change of culture.They even have a piano player, drinks, and candy during intermission.Plenty of parking, lots of great restaurants nearby from the $-$$$ budget. Highly recommended for the young and the mature white-hair audience.",mellymacias
40,Good Community Theatre,"It's a small theatre and every seat we have had provided a terrific view.The cast bios tell the story that they are excited to perform and thanking all their supporters. While the theatre has always had good crowds, ti could use even more support.Artistically, they push the envelope from traditional interpretation.",Robert K
50,GREAT FUN FOR EVERYONE!,"I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the LB Playhouse! LBCC Child Development held their annual fund raiser there for many years. It was something I looked forward to annually. The actors are top-notch, the plays are intriguing, and the seating is awesome! If feels like you are actually part of the play. So much fun.",Yesship
40,A Great Local Playhouse,LB Playhouse has been putting on productions for a very long time. The theatre is small so every seat is a good seat. The acting is amazing. A must see!!!!,Rick&David
50,Great local theatre in Long Beach,"While we are not season ticket holders, we attend many productions annually for decades. This is a <99 seat theatre in a rectangle with seats on three sides. Every seat is good. Plays are typically classical rather than cutting edge. In LA small theatre compensation is basically minimum wage, so tickets are reasonably priced and actors are performing for ""love of it"". Nevertheless, quality is very good if not up to standards of equity theatres in downtown LA.",edvonlef
50,Always a great time,We have been attending the Playhouse for many years. It is a wonderful venue. There are two theaters at the site. Downstairs there are 200 seats arranged on three sides of the stage. Upstairs there are 100 seats in an auditorium style. Upstairs shows are more cutting edge. Downstairs shows are more mainstream. We attend downstairs mostly. The seating is intimate which means you don't miss a thing and are right on top of the action. It is always entertaining AND reasonably priced.,LongBeachUS
40,Little Bit of Local Theater History,The productions are consistent in this historic theater. It is amazing how much live theater and variety is actually in Long Beach.,Alexander_Designs
50,great playhouse,"This is a great little playhouse. Two different stages, both are great no bad seats good talent good productions.",jdlove4
40,Theatre for the common man,"My wife and I see 100+ live theater productions/year. We rarely miss a LBP show if we have not previously seen it. For a local theater, the LBP presents theater beyond comparable theatres in the Los Angeles area. The shows are better than the ""local talent"" shows but not so well done as in equity theaters. On the other hand, the show selection is usually wholesome rather than the cutting edge of equity theaters.Singles, couples and families are all at home at the LBP.",Kenneth C
50,Entertaining & extremely well done,"In this area that's the capital of the entertainment industry in the US, it's no surprise to find outstanding talent in the more modest venues. This theater delivers on this big time. The stage is a simple space with nicely banked & comfortable seats on three sides of the performance area. It's a small place so the ambience is extremely intimate, well-suited for live drama. The production itself that we attended was of very high quality in terms of staging & performances. It is an accessible location. I highly recommend it.",carolshodge
50,Best little playhouse ever,"Have seen more plays here than anywhere else in the world! Delightful venue, amazing productions for just the right price.",SweetnDandy
50,Great little playhouse.,Great local talent. Your practically sitting on the stage. Will be visiting regularly. Don't miss out.,boanut
