30,Used to be a hidden gem - but sadly - in the process of being converted to an office complex with some retail space...,"Westside Pavilion used to be one of my favorite indoor malls - but, with the opening up of the Century City Westfield in late 2017, and competition from the 3rd Street Promenade Santa Monica shopping center along the beach, Nordstroms, Macy's and many of the other stores have vacated from this lovely mall. As of August 2018, it still had Hollister, Victoria's Secret, H&M, and some other stores, but most of the eateries upstairs in the food court have shut down. If all you want to do is to walk around indoors, and just window shop, then, it's still a nice place, but as of August 2018, believe the property was going to be converted to 80% office space and 20% retail. The connection between the Landmark Movie Theater and the East side of the mall through Nordstroms is no longer open. You still get 3 hours of parking free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ubbabe
10,Mall Headed for Bankruptcy,"Terrible place with more than half of the space empty. It is like a ghost town here, so my guess is that the mall will close before too long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
30,The Death of the Mall,"I so wish I could give a better rating to the Westside Pavilion, but sadly, such would be misleading. This mall is so pretty, it is clean and parking is easy. It is also almost empty. If you are visiting, and want to take a walk indoors, this is a great place to do that. As for shopping, many of the stores are now closed.As many malls in America are learning, the internet is taking them right out of business. In this mall, which used to be packed in the middle of the day, it is like a ghost town. And that is sad. So many jobs lost, and little shops gone. We went there to get shoes for my grandson and also to walk. We went to Foot Locker and it was great. I feel terrible that I doubt it will be there in a year.This mall is a great place to walk though and there are still some stores open and part of the food court. I think the movie house is still there, but I am not positive. I will miss this mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
30,Closing,"I was just there for a meeting last motth, it was like a ghost town many of the shops are closed as well as the 2 anchors very few people here",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jojtrust
40,Toddler Friendly Mall,"This mall is great for families. Indoors, playground, shops to buy kid clothes, movie theatre nearby",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KoreanConven
30,Different Place on Different Days,"This very large shopping center has a maze of escalators, many levels of dining options, and a very strange parking lot. This shopping center was within walking distance from us. We would not recommend walking there alone - especially at night - as we had a strange run-in with some locals that was less than welcoming. There is an in-house Target that was helpful in stocking up on fresh food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skelshaw

30,Not bad,"There are so many shops and very good parking structure, but this is an old mall and needs immediate renovation",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amirk973
40,"Shopping, Restaurants & Movies ...","The Westside Pavillion is the largest shopping center near the Westside, until you get to Santa Monica, but that's a ways to drive. It's a triple decker affair with Nordstroms & Macy's being the anchors and then lots of other stores, name brand and others. Connects to more shops & movies. Parking underneath. Loads of restaurants. Good for mall shopping, the eat & see a movie, all in one! Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,Lots of shops,"Westpoint Pavilion contains a large range of lshops, including department stores, Macys and Nordstrom, as well as any number of specialty shops. The food court is located on the top floor and had a good choice of outlets and cuisines to choose from. My visit was quite brief but everything I needed was there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iris48
40,Huge,"This place is HUGE! It has a lot of nice shops, nice dinervenue and is very clean. Some of the cleanest restrooms I've seen in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SentinaS
30,Parking Nightmare,"The first time visiting this mall and the parking was a nightmare. People stop and wait for cars to leave their space, and then you wait. The food court was a challenge to reach, but is possible. Depends on where you enter the mall. We took the elevator to the 3rd floor and then an escalator up to the food court. There is a variety of choices at the food court. ( I choose Panda) I enjoyed shopping at Macy's, Nordstrom, Ann Taylor (Gloria was such a big help), Hallmark, Papyrus and so much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlot
20,Annoyed by the blaring music/advertisements,"I've been coming to this mall for many years, and usually have a good experience -- there is a decent mixture of shops, it's clean and well-maintained. The parking structure has been a running joke to locals for many years -- it can be horribly complicated and congested -- but in recent years has improved. However, I find myself going to this mall less and less when I visit LA, for one main reason -- the food court is simply blasted with music and tv adverts from all directions. Wherever you try to sit, there are tv screens staring down at you, blaring out horrible noise. It is simply impossible to relax and enjoy food (let alone conversation -- don't even try to talk like a normal human being with so much background noise); and it's even more annoying to think that the mall is trying to sell you things while you sit and eat. It is incredibly unpleasant. And now that the Century City mall has such an attractive outdoor eating area, in addition to the very nice selection of stores and the fantastic cinema, there's just little reason to put up with the onslaught of noise at the Pavilion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/914bj
40,Worth a visit,Plenty of good and designer shops this outside Mall is clean and well serviced. Lots of restaurants to eat at. Parking is easy and the is a cab rank just outside. Worth going to,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/21Davids22
50,shopping,There are pretty cool stores. From high end items to the average price items. Gives a lot of options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/681jackiet
50,Excellent,This is a very nice mall.Lots of shops to choose from.Access to the location and parking was very good.The mall is nice and clean with a large food court for shoppers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normanl816
40,Love the shops here!,"I loved seeing all the stores you see on T.V all in one place! Louis Voutton , Banana Republic, Juicy Couture, Michael Kors and much more! This was my first time in Los angeles and this mall was walking distance from my hotel. I absolutely loved being outside here it feels great to just walk around ,window shop and enjoy the LA weather .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99JessicaW99
30,Not what I expected,"My daughter and I went here on March 16th.My husband and I were visiting her and her husband who were staying in Westwood after he got after the hospital.She and I thought we would take a break and check out the Westside Pavillion since we had not been there for many, many years.We parked on the side where the movie theaters were and we had to walk a long, long way across the bridge between the 2 structures to get to the stores. We shopped in Forever 21 and found some great deals on costume jewelry. We went to Macy's and we were surmised that they did not have as much selection of purses and clothes as the Macy's in Victoria Gardens. Most of the stores did not have many customers.Most people seemed to be at the movies or the restaurants.I guess this is not where the best shopping is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Default33009
30,Parking is the bane of this place,"The Westside Pavilion has a nice array of chain type shops and a couple of anchor stores. A reasonable food court again with a decent cross section of food establishments.However, try to get to the movie side of the place and good luck on finding a parking spot. You have to figure on getting to the pavilion at least 1/2 hour before the movie starts. If you do not, good chance the battle for an elite parking spot will become more like a joust with a good chance your car, might get dinged. This happens during the prime time movie slots every time I have gone there.The entrances also are very tough to manage as both entrances and exits end on Pico Blvd. which is a busy street and with limited access.Like the movie theatre , the parking is bad, very bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrankG379
50,The foodcourt is excellent!,We opted for this on a rain day and our teen kids wanted to visit Hollister shop. We stumbled upon the fantastic foodcourt that was a notch above your average shopping mall foodcourt. If your there shopping and a hungry dont bother looking elsewhere,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmlowe
