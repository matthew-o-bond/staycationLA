40,Birthday party fun for 8 year olds,"My son was invited to his friend’s birthday party on a Sunday afternoon. My son was late, but the employee let my son play in the next laser tag game. The event was 4-6pm and not crowded.The party room is clean, and air conditioning is good. TV’s in the party room for guests who are not playing laser tag. Scores are posted on the TV monitor.We could enjoy pizza, salad, and soda. There is an arcade room that my son enjoyed with his friends. The staff is very friendly. There is a separate snack bar area for people playing laser tag but are not with a party.",GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Great laser tag experience,Went yesterday while in town for spring break and this was the only laser tag business open on Monday. We had the whole place to ourselves. The owner was super nice and friendly and the laser tag section was awesome. I loved that it was 2 stories. The kids had a great time on the bumper carts and the mini bowling as well. Will gladly support this local business again when we are back in town,Wade K
