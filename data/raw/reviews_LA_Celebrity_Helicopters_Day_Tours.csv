50,Unforgettable Experience!,"This was an absolutely amazing experience! I highly recommend Celebrity Helicopter when you are in need of a unique experience, you cannot get anywhere else. Our pilot truly made the trip enjoyable, with his bright personality. I felt like VIP every step of the way. If you book, you will not be disappointed!",Kira G
50,5 star - absolute professional !,"Helicopter Tour was fantastic, Robin was an absolute Pro ! His knowledge and experience sets him apart from the amateurs !",Tracy Phillips
50,Fantastic Experience,"Thank goodness for YouTube - some fellow travelers posted about Celebrity Helicopters in their VLOG and immediately I knew this was the perfect surprise for my hubby during our 10 yr anniversary trip to LA.Booking was very easy and they called to confirm a day before. I booked the VIP tour for an hour of fly time, I added the mini limo pick up with champagne/snacks.We were a little late being picked up but we all know how LA traffic is - picked up in a Range Rover. Driver was super nice and informative about LA tooWe go to the location and of course my hubby was on cloud 9. Robin Petgrave was a fantastic Pilot! Super fun to fly with and great at pointing out all the sites! We had a blast",drmindidelia
50,"Amazing flight, highlight of our stay in L. A.","Flying with Robin, our pilot, was so much fun. He took us to see famous people's houses, beautiful beaches and Hollywood sign from close up. We also saw dolphins in the sea, flew over financial centre of L. A. and Downtown and many more places. Robin has amazing pictures on the Instagram if you search robin.at.tam you can preview places he takes you to see from bird's perspective.I would fly with Robin again and highly recommend this experience to anyone visiting L. A.",Kamila Volejnickova
10,Avoid at all cost,"Worst experience ever dealing with this company. I book hundreds of tours and experiences annually for my clients and have never been treated in such a horrid way.My clients contacted me at the time when Celebrity Helicopters were suppose to be picking them up at their hotel to let me know that no one had showed and they were not answering their phone. I was of course mortified as I had reconfirmed the pick up time and the tour with the owner Robin Petgrave several times and tried to call the company myself to see what was going on. After several attempts I managed to get through to a volunteer, who unbelievably was alone in the office and had no access to booking data. I was promised they would call back or contact my client asap to arrange the transport and get them to the start location, as the volunteer suspected I did have a valid booking even if she could not access the system.Some time went by and neither me or my client heard back. I called again and was simply told that they cannot actually call foreign phone numbers, only US numbers. This is of course firstly outrageous as they have no problem taking foreigners bookings and then leaving them stranded, and secondly probably a lie as why would calls be restricted in this manner.I was then told a car was to be sent to collect my clients. A Lyft. The only reason I had booked with this particular company was the fact that they offered an option with mini limo hotel transfers on Viator. I wanted to offer my high profile clients a touch of luxury. Now instead of a mini limo, they were getting a Lyft. No explanation or apology at any stage as to what had happened to the originally booked service.My clients again waited and waited, and no one showed. Turned out they had sent the Lyft to the wrong address, when I had specifically given them the name of the hotel and there is only one in LA. I had also confirmed this previously with Mr Petgrave twice so it should have been crystal clear. And you would assume that after neglecting to honor a prepaid booking the measures to fix the situation would be taken carefully.The situation then continued to me finally getting to speak to Mr Petgrave himself. Instead of offering an explanation or an apology, his reply to my query and concern about the fact that my clients had been waiting for quite a while was ""why are you still talking"". Not kidding. He repeatedly said this to me over the phone when I was asking what had happened and how this will be resolved. Absolutely unbelievable.During this time they refused to call my clients, they refused to provide the Lyft drivers details so that either myself or my client could have contacted him to figure out where he was and overall continued to behave in a very rude manner.I have contacted Mr Petgrave several times after the incident offering him the chance to explain or apologize but he has failed to respond.I have also contacted Viator and managed to get partial compensation as they could not deny the fact that the booking had been completely neglected. Through them Mr Petgrave had passed on a message saying that they do not offer a mini limo transfer at all. This was however clearly advertised on Viator and stated on my booking voucher, as well as confirmed by Mr Petgrade over emails before the date of the tour. So indeed, this company is a scam as a previous reviewer has pointed out, and I sincerely urge anyone considering to book with them to think again. Do not support businesses like this when there are some lovely, honest and honorable people out there working really hard to earn a living.",Laura
50,TGo Gets Married 2018!!,"My new bride and I took our helicopter ride and enjoyed every second of it! From the pickup at our hotel to the drop off was exciting!! Our pilot, Robin, was friendly and professional and made our special day even more memorable!! Would definitely recommend to everyone!",Camper50387884856
10,Change of dates,Well I booked a helicopter flight for myself and my daughter 4 months in advance of our trip this month. 4 days before our planned booking I received an email asking me to change our booking until 4 days later. We were only in LA for 24 hours so this was not possible. I did not even get a reply to my email informing them of this. We had to chase them to find out if our booked flight was going ahead. We were not even told why our flight couldn't go ahead.,LoveTravel256020
50,Helicopters,"Robin Petgrave is awesome. He goes far above and beyond the call. Very kind, personable and giving. You can’t ask for more. We love this man in our conmunity.",Angela T
30,Mixed bag,"I booked the Deluxe Champagne Airplane tour over LA for our honeymoon directly through the website. I didn’t receive confirmation so emailed directly and was given an email confirmation but no booking reference or receipt.I had arranged for us to be picked up from our hotel, the driver was over 15mins late which was worrying as we weren’t convinced we hadn’t been conned. However driver was brilliant and pointed out loads of great locations on the way.The tour itself was good, we weren’t given champagne or canapés as the website suggests but cava and crisps. Nonetheless the pilot was excellent and we flew over all the main sightseeing locations.I would recommend but perhaps do through somewhere like Viator for piece of mind.",Karen L
30,Good,"Memorable trip, great staff but lacked in professionalism but that was over shadowed by the fact that the staff were good",Sightseer722395
50,Flying with the doors off!,"Booked an hour long flight with Robin & Esteban, we had a tour with the doors off so I could make the most of the experience and take some photos.We felt really safe with Robin at the controls, he guided us though the metropolis and his excellent communication allowed me to get the most of the experience.We headed to DTLA from Compton, then over to the Hollywood Hills, next along Santa Monica to Venice and then the climax was flying in to LAX airspace! I got to meet Isaiah Cooper - who is one of Robin's students, this young man holds the record for the youngest American African to fly across the country. I would definitely do this again, loved every second.",LHRflightpath
50,Excellent service!,I see a lot of reviews and wonder if it's the same company!We called the company to ask to be moved to an earlier date and they obliged. They sent their driver immediately and arranged our flight. On arrival we met Robin who's just such a beautiful person! He made the trip quite fun and enjoyable! My mum and I were on it together and she too had such fun. When I read these other reviews I really can't understand how it could be the same company.I strongly recommend them and Robin is a star!I LOVED it!,kerryleesharip
50,Fantastic trip and service. Highly recommend!,"I decided to treat my girlfriend to a flight over LA for her 21st birthday, and it was a great decision. We both loved it! Despite a little confusion on my part because I booked it through a third party website, Robin came and picked us up from our apartment and offered us a free upgrade to a more expensive helicopter tour over Beverley Hills and Hollywood. It was honestly the best way to see the city in my opinion. Spectacular views and some great commentary. Robin was a great guy - very funny, polite and he knew his stuff. We were really delighted with how the day went. Really great customer service in a personal way. Thanks again Robin and co.!Peter & Lindsay (Belfast, Northern Ireland)",PeteMull
10,Celebrity Helicoptor Tours - Los Angeles VIP Grand Helicopter Tour (with mini limo service),"Well, don't even know where to start. Booked this through British Airways and were only offered this company as an option but presumed that as it was via BA it should be pretty reliable - how wrong could I have been. Unfortunately, and I could kick myself now but I reviewed them on Tripadvisor AFTER I had made the booking only to read bad review after bad review so I had my fears set already.I tried to call the company to reserve a slot from the UK prior to travel but no answer so I called the Sofitel, LA and the concierge there Nestor, very kindly called them and they advised I should call when I arrived to confirm the flight slot. This we did immediately on Saturday 2nd May and the company confirmed a slot for 10am on Monday 4th and said that someone would collect us at 9:45am which the concierge questioned as the airfield in Compton was about 45 minutes away so they confirmed 8:30am outside the hotel.Monday 4th May arrived and we were waiting outside from about 8:20am, 8:30am came and went. At 9am we had the concierge call and they had no idea of our booking and said they would call us back when their colleague came in at 9:30am This also came and went so we called back - same person answered and could not remember speaking to us and said they would call back - yes you guessed it, no call.It was now 10:30am and we called again, this time someone else answered and said they did not know where the mini limo was, did not not know what time the pilot would arrive and basically refused to even pay for a taxi for us to take us there when the concierge suggested it as a gesture of good will. Their only proposal was to offer us a plane ride in the afternoon but could not say what time!In the end we thought the safest thing was to cancel as we had wasted the whole morning of our last day in LA so you can imagine how frustrated and annoyed we were. The Concierge Dana was horrified at the pure lack of customer service so I don't think she will be recommending them any time soon.I have since written to BA and explained the situation and asked for the airmiles to be returned to me as well as recommending that they find another provider - no response there but that is a whole other story.So folks, please do not touch this company with a barge pole - they are the most unreliable and unprofessional mob I have ever come across, as all the previous negative reviews rightly reported!I would not have given 1 star if it were an option - Wish I had read the reviews first.",pattirw3
20,Disappointing,We were excited about this tour but was left disappointed. Service was bad. Complimentary snack basket was poor and our driver was not sociable at all. We were all dressed to the nines and excited to act like celebrities for the night and we ended up feeling overdressed on a public transportation type ride. The helicopter ride itself was beautiful though so just choose another company. I don't recommend this company at all. Pick another.,Jennifer G
10,Rescheduled my flight without a refund,As a tourist from Germany in L.A. I got a plane flight above L.A. with Celebrity Helicopters for my birthday. I was already looking forward to it but a day before the flight my flight was rescheduled for the next day - right at the time when I was flying to San Francisco. When I asked them to please refund my credit card charge everything seemed very straightforward and I was sure that they are refunding my money as soon as possible - my flight should have been on the 17th of January and so far I have not seen any money refunded. They are also not answering any E-Mails. I think they just expect that someone from abroad will not put any effort in getting the money back as the person is on another continent anyway. Very dubious company and I would suggest you to never ever book a flight at Celebrity Helicopters.,Philipp K
50,THE experience in a nutshell,"Where to begin?I was told to call a specific number, ask for Robin, and wait patiently to be picked up from the airport. So I did. The initial story was, he was an employee for a local radio station and was to transport me to the station to ‘claim my prize’.I was on a ‘goose-chase’, if you will. A goose-chase my boyfriend sent me on that very morning. I flew in from Texas to California, alone (this was part of my hunt).Robin had me convinced he was only the ‘transporter’. He played the role very well and before I knew it, he was piloting his way, in a helicopter, through the skies of Los Angeles California, with me by his side.Yes, I was initially terrified when my escort and I were playing in the helicopter and he decided to turn it on. For some, very odd reason, I stayed in the helicopter (despite the fact that I wanted to jump out because I thought my escort was only a transporter), but I stayed.Long story short, Robin pretended to be my transporter and I believed it all.Our helicopter ride was quite the experience (my first ever). When we landed, I saw my boyfriend standing there in a tuxedo and I, instantly knew, Robin was in on his plan. My boyfriend then began talking to me and before I knew it, he was down on one knee and I said YES!Everything was recorded from the landing to the proposal (by Robin’s very good friend, AJ, who did a beautiful job on the video BTW). Robin played a very crucial and unforgettable role in the proposal. He is very personable (as evident by my willingness to board a helicopter with a ‘total stranger’, at the time). If you are not looking for an unforgettable experience, don’t call Robin. If you’re looking for prim and proper, talk to him and let him know (I’m sure he could play the part). He is an amazing person and I had the time of my life with him. I will definitely be seeing him again and I highly recommend him to anyone and everyone.",Jane A
10,Total Nightmare and Ripoff,"we booked a helicopter tour directly with the owner Robin Petgrave, drove for an hour from our hotel to the ""take off"" location, then waited almost 2 hours for the pilot, who never showed up. We texted and called Robin and he assured us again and again that the pilot was on his way. We finally had to leave to catch our flight home from Los Angeles.Robin himself was busy receiving an award from Ebony magazine for his professional achievements! He offered us a refund and promised to credit my visa -- which he eagerly processed via phone and charged immediately when we booked. After politely texting and emailing him several times over the past six months, i have finally realized he is a total scam artist has no intention of refunding our $500 payment. I strongly recommend that you avoid any contact with this company. MY next move will be to contact the Better Business Bureau and Ebony magazine to advise them of this scam.",MrsAsher
10,complete rip off,"Booked a helicopter flight with champagne through a reputable travel agent in the uk and expected more than the rip off we got. We did not even get helicopter as that would have been charged extra, we were take up in an old plane. The ""champagne"" was cheap red plonk, and we had to wait 15 minutes for them to find a corkscrew. As it was we were charged us$ 70 for pick up and fuel charge which was not mentioned on the original voucher. The pilot did not speak to us as the communication system was not working. Our safety briefing by the pilot before we set off was ""if you smell smoke tap me on the shoulder, this is how you open the door if you need to jump out"". I don't know now how we had the courage to get in that thing, but it was either that or nothing, and we had already paid an extremely high price. I am surprised how this company gets any business.",david934
10,Near death experience,"Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! It was sketchy from the start. The place was hard to find and when we finally got there, we were greeted by multiple children. This place lacked professionalism. One of the kids approached us and told us that we didn't pay a fee that was required and said so on their site. We asked what the fee was and what it covered and when we said we were going to look it up, he quickly responded by saying, ""Oh, you booked it through our partner site and the fee was covered."" How convenient. We waited a few minutes for our champagne, which was worth no more than $5. The glasses were dirty as well and the snacks were cheap. NOTHING LIKE WHAT THE WEBSITE ADVERTISED!!! Very disappointed nonetheless. This place is a total joke, if not a scam. Towards the end of the flight, the plane had a glitch and the pilot said, ""What the f***!?"" The landing was rough and it scared the hell out of my girlfriend and I. This place should be shutdown!",Will C
10,The worst do not go and get ripped off!!,"This place is beyond horrible!! I decided to treat my friend on his birthday to a Helicopter ride over the city. I arrived on time for my scheduled 3:30 flight after driving an hour and a half only to be told that the Helicopter was broken, and not able to fly. WHAT!? I had only booked the flight at 12:30PM that day, how can this happen?? I was then offered a ride in an airplane that was parked outside their office. It looked like a glider from World War 2 with an engine on it. They called it the “champagne sunset tour”. At this point I wished I had brought my Dramamine because this place was making me sick!! I asked my friend if he wanted to go on the plane, ”No Way!” he said, and we left. Within an hour I found a company that had great reviews on-line. They picked me up at Santa Monica airport from a gorgeous terminal. I ended up having an amazing hour flight over Malibu, Hollywood, and Los Angeles area. After reading reviews on Yelp and other websites about Celebrity helicopter it became clear that bait and switch is normal behavior for this company. The only Celebrity this place should be flying is Lindsay Lohan, so she can for once have a legitimate excuse for not showing up on time!!",David C
10,WISH there was a minus 1,"Trip was booked for Sunday 31ST MARCH.phoned the day before to be told "" THE HELICOPTER WASN'T WORKING BUT THEY COULD PROVIDE A PLANE"" then 10 minutes later that was cancelled..Re-scheduled for pick up at 9AM WEDNESDAY 3RD finally collected at 11AM Robin gave some guff about the original driver had to take his kid to hospital.. Original package was t-shirts and souvenir photos that never happened.no helicopter again instead a small plane [LOVELY PILOT JIM] followed by champagne after as an apology AGAIN NO CHAMPAGNE....YOU WOULD BE WISE TO GIVE THIS MOB A WIDE BERTH.....",gooner18kent
50,"Fantastic, friendly airplane flight !","Pre-booked from UK phoned when arrived in CA and arranged flight for next day. Collected from Hotel in Huntington Beach and taken to airfield. Very friendly staff, pilot was waiting for us on our arrival. Marvelous 25 minute flight in light aircraft along beaches and other focal points. One of our best flights. Very good value for money. Will certainly do another flight next time in L.A",Scorpionsholidays
50,Memorable trip over LA,"We had been to Hollywood on a long weekend and we had a memorable trip. We loved the locals and the non-stop city. As we had more time with us, we went ahead and booked LA tour trip with Celebrity Helicopters.Chief Pilot Robert C Petgrave is a happy go person, with a great attitude and genuine interest. He showed us all the items we discussed and was kind enough to take us to the places we liked the most. He was very friendly to us and so was his kid. It so happened that his kid was crying and he had to take him with us. It was like a family of four traveling together.We really enjoyed the trip. Will sure come back for a night tour over LA.",SriRamakrishnanV
20,Very disappointed tour over LA,"I booked this tour online during our stay in LA. I only booked one day in advance and Robin confirmed the booking quickly via email which I was very impressed with. You have to pay up front via credit card. We stayed in Beverly Hills so getting to Burbank took quite a while and is also expensive (taxi about 80US$).When we arrived there we had to look for somebody to greet us and this was done by some kids. I decided to book through this company as I liked the idea of 'Inspire Tomorrow's Youth' as indicated on the Celebrity Helicopter Tours website.We had to wait for about 15 minutes for the pilot who was late (not from a previous flight or so) which was no problem and he took us to the plane. We booked the Deluxe Champange tour which included:Long Beach SkyscrapersThe Queen MaryL. A. HarborWorld Cruise CenterPorts-O-Call VillagePalos Verdes EstatesThe cliffs off Palos Verdes PeninsulaRolling Hills Estates (USA’s “Top5 Highest Income Per Capita” … stunning homes)Cabrillo BeachManhattan BeachHermosa BeachRedondo Beach & PierSan PedroThe South Bay (LA’s Underrated Peninsula)Famous Celebrity Homes & LandmarksSpectacular View of Downtown Los AngelesThe Staples CenterL.A. ColiseumTelevision CityThe Beverly CenterCentury CityGetty CenterBel AireBeverly HillsHollywood BowlHollywood SignGriffith Park ObservatoryDodgers Stadium, and tons more.On the plane was a cute basked with a bottle of champagne (sparkling wine) and some snacks which was nice and a great start to the flight. After that it all just went downhill. The pilot hardly never spoke, even when we asked questions he did not really say a lot and it seemed to us he was not very knowledgeable about the tour/area even though he said he is doing this since 30 years.From the sights we should have seen we only saw maybe 7 of them. Maybe we did see more but the pilot did not talk to us so we had no clue what we were looking at. When we asked about flying over the celebrity homes the pilot said that nobody knows what celebrity lives in what house etc. so he did not even bother flying there.After we landed the girl at the counter asked how the flight was and I told her that it was not what we expected and it was quite disappointing. She asked why and I told her that we have seen hardly non of the sights as indicated on their website and flyer. Her answer was: Hm.. I guess the pilot forgot!! No sorry or let me reimburse you a part of the money. Nothing. We were about to leave when Robin came over (he did not ask about our flight experience) and said he has a T-shirt for us and if a photo was taken (no photo was taken either) and to hold on. We said it's fine no worries but also did not want to be rude so we waited. However, after we waited about 15 minutes just standing around we decided to leave. I was just very disappointed about the overall experience. This was a treat for my boyfriend and I thought I do something special which it wasn't at all.I am sure there are better tour providers in L.A. and for the next time I prefer to spend some more money and get the real experience you would expect. I cannot recommend Celebrity Helicopter Tours as all.",Pufflerd
50,A fantastic trip over LA,"I really enjoyed the helicopter flight over LA. We were picked up from our hotel in Malibu and driven to Bob Hope Airport (Burbank) where we met our pilot. The tour took us across the San Fernando Valley, the over the Hollywood Hills giving us a close up of the Hollywood sign. We then flew over Dodgers Stadium then circled about 100 feet over downtown LA. Heading south we headed towards King Quay the turned north to travel at 100 feet above the water up to Santa Monica. We finished the flight with a tour of the celebrity mansions in Brentwood and Beverly Hills. A great trip with some great photos.",David B
50,Looking for a treat – This is the business!,"During a short stay in LA wanted to do something special which would stay in the mind for a lifetime. There are several options in most big cities for the Heli-tour experience and shopping in advance from the UK I had to weigh up the offerings but the fact that this experience included a pick-up and return to our hotel by Hollywood Boulevard made it very attractive.We arrived in LA, made final confirmations by phone and were picked up in the morning and driven to Compton Airfield where this business shares the site with the LAPD. After a quick check on weight, yes its kind of crucial to make sure the bird is going to fly safely, we boarded the 4 seater and took off for our selected 30 minute tour.The route took in all the sights, The Olympic Stadium, Hollywood Bowl, Dodgers Stadium, Staples Centre and nods toward the homes of the stars. Three stand outs for me were the site where the 60’s TV series had the Batmobile emerging from its Bat Cave; Flying through – yes through not just past – the skyscrapers of downtown LA; and the pinnacle to hover level with and just yards in front of the iconic Hollywood sign.All that for about £100 ($150) a head – memories don’t come much better than that",Peter B
