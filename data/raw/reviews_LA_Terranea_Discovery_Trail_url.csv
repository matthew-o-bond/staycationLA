50,Hike with Spectacular Views!,We had visited the nearby Interpretive Center - and then saw this Discovery Trail. We did the quite easy loop walk heading NW from the Center. Absolutely stunning views of the coastline. Just beware of rattlesnakes. Quite the amazing walk though - totally uncrowded.,pasowine

50,Amazing Views,"This is a nice scenic hike with great views. Right next to the ocean.Always beautiful, but if you go during the sunset, it’s even more so!What a gem!",nikkil946
50,Rustic Walk In The Midst Of A Resort,You can park at Pelican Cove Park and walk this trail into Terranea. At Terranea you can eat at one of several restaurants (Nelson's is the best place with a view on the coast) and then walk to Terranea Beach.,Richard K

50,Breathtaking Terranea Discovery Trail,"The Terranea Discovery Trail has breathtaking views of Catalina Island, Pt. Vicente Lighthouse, and the waves of the Pacific crashing upon beautiful rocky cliffs.A beautiful moderate hike. And you can always stop by Nelson’s at the Terranea for a drink and a great view.",kpburgo
40,Rumbling rocks,"The trail is well maintained, long, and o.k. views. To me, the most impressive part of the trail is where it ends at a rock beach. The beach is all pebbles/rocks and the surf rumbles them over one other in a 'clitter clatter'. Almost magical.",davidkoch2017
50,What a great trail,"Sometimes, you do not have to stay at the expensive Terranea Hotel in order to enjoy this trail. Just park your car on the street before you see the valet or parking kiosk and enjoy the trail! It is easy to find.",suziQ38
50,GO down to the cave,Great exercise and you get to visit seals and an ocean cave. Or you can sit for a while at the small beach or take a kayak ride.,JC R
40,Nice little hiking trail.,"This is a super easy and short hiking trail, we usually take to dine at Nelson's. We bring the dogs (who can sit with us outside at Nelson's). There are viewing points along the way with binocular viewers you can use to see as far as Catalina island. Like the rest of Terranea, it's all about the views.",Tess F
50,Beautiful hiking trail,Very relaxing and peaceful hike to go with a date or the family. Listening to the ocean waves crashing onto the shore rocks is very tranquil. The scenic views are breathtaking as well.,Paul
50,Great Trail Along The Pacific,The Discovery Trail goes miles and miles along the Pacific with bathroom stops here and there. Brown gravel is great for walking and running. Plenty of benches to rest and enjoy the scenery. Best bet: Pick up trail at the Interpretive Center and walk to Terranea to check out the property.,Larry G
40,Looks like a great trail but not for me that day!,"Looks like a great hiking trail with scenic vistas. The sign gave me pause and I was not dressed for a hike, so maybe another time.",FundDude
50,Dogs allowed,Great place for a coastal walk with your dog. The trails have amazing views. We enjoy a walk here when the sun is shining.,wombatdavid
40,Easy way to maximize a nice hike.,"Trail is very nice, it is not difficult and it offers a great view of theocean along the way. Dogs are allowed.",Marlenei100
50,Nice walking trail with views connected directly to the Terranea Resort,"There are plenty of activities in and around the Terranea Resort; walking the trails around the resort to sweeping views of the ocean is one free and easily accessible choice for getting some exercise and some inspiration. The trail is mostly dirt with some steps and some expanded viewing areas with seating and fixed binoculars. The views range from top of cliff to right at the rocky shoreline, all presenting far and up-close sights including plenty of wildlife. Highly recommended.",raharrington85
50,Get your steps in!,Great trail through the resort with beautiful views all around! Easily connects to the public trail if you want to walk further!,Judi-in-touch
50,Fun beautiful easy walk,"Perfect coast cliff views of the Pacific and Catalina Island! Dirt trail so wear sneakers or walking shoes. No age limit, but keep and eye on kids near the lookouts!",CTE
