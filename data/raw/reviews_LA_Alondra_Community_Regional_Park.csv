40,Still a great experience,"We reviewed Alondra last year - when we visited a lot when staying with Family nearby.Back again from the UK - this time pushing a new Grandchild around in a pram. Still the nice ""homely"" feel about it. Lots of friendly folk walking around the park trying to get the pounds off!",BobandJosie
40,Don't feed the ducks!,"We went to this wonderful park to use the splash pad which is very popular with smaller children who love to run in an out of the waterfalls and cool off!There is a pool with free admission, picknick and BBQ areas and a large lake with many wild birds in a beautiful park! But you are advised not to feed the birds as it causes overpopulation and insufficient food!",Farangdingdong
40,Just as a City Park ought to be!,"Alhondra City Park in North Torrrance has a lot to offer a city dweller. Whether it is an 18 hole pay and play public course, swimming pool, skate park, jogging around the lake, or just hanging out with the Family, Alhondra Park really packs it all in.As visitors from the UK, staying with Family nearby, we felt just as safe as back home in England taking our young Granddaughter out for an afternoon stroll.And in February it was a lot warmer!",BobandJosie
