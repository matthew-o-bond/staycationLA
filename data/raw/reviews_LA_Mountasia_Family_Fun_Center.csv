30,holiday fun MLK day,"I took my 9 year old grandson here to spend some time with him. The only package with games is the 43.99$ package for 3 hours. Yes, this does seem really expensive for 3 hours. I tried to rationalize the expense comparing it to other venues. A movie for the two of us is pretty close to 45.00$ with snacks, can't remember the price of sky high or DojoBoom (TO) but they are costly too. When using the prepaid card it does take a minute or so to recalculate and load up so you have to stand and wait a minute before you can play again. You do get unlimited rock wall, bumper boats and cars. Bottom line he loves it and yes, the place does need some refurbishing.",sandramJ3690YI
30,Birthday party at Mountasia,"We went this past weekend to celebrate our granddaughters' 7th birthday. This place has a lot of acitivites for kids and some for adults. However, be prepared to drop some serious coin. Although a package deal was purchased by her parents, it was still kind of expensive. Depending on the package purchased, you have some attractions that are unlimited. We paid for a round of mini golf but (if you qualify) be sure to ask for the senior discount. It's just a couple of $$ off but if you don't ask for it, it's not offered. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",Dahlia Ruiz G
30,Expensive for time spent,"Took my two 11 year old grandsons to this entertainment venue. We played one round of miniature golf, but the weather was too hot to enjoy any of the outdoor activities. The inside arcade was impressive, but really expensive.",cwalter2014
40,Date night!!,"My husband and I came here on our date night last night. We went to dinner and then we decided last minute to come and play around on the Go-Kart area. We spent 18.00 (together) jumped in a kart and took a spin around their track!! It was so fun!! Then we hopped out and left! It was quick, easy, and fun! Great for kids? YES!! Plus, they serve Thrifty ice cream!!!! Hellllllloooooooo!!!! Best ice cream ever!!!",Mrs.Amy19
10,"No longer the ""Fun Center""","Our son enjoyed their go carts for a couple years and when we started they charged $20 for 3 hours which was a great deal. A while back they changed it to $25 which was a good deal. Recently they were charging $10/5 minutes which was outrageous and now they are charging $40 for 3 hours. Not only that but when I called last Friday to find out why they were charging $10/5 for minutes they said it was because school was not out, but on Monday the price would go back to $25 for 3 hours.Imagine our surprise when it was $40 for 3 hours. Recently the park went through a ownership change and it is obvious they no longer care about their long time customers. Up until the ownership change the staff was friendly and were very accomodating to special needs kids, since the ownership change it has become all about the money. The staff are not happy, I hear them talking about the new owners and they no longer seem friendly towards the special needs kids and their needs.Today was our last time to Mountasia, we will not pay $40 for unhappy and unfriendly staff in a run down establishment that smells bad and is falling apart. $25 was a deal and we could deal with the delapitated equipment. Seems all they care about now is money now.For this kinda pricing we can go to Six Flags for an entire day. No longer a ""Fun Center""",slmsdirect

40,Nice way to spend a short day,"With Disney being so expensive, this is a nice way to bring your kids to a fun place that isn't that expensive. There is an indoor play area with all kinds of games, arcade, etc. Outside there is a boat ride, race car track, baseball game tent, etc. There is also a kid friendly restaurant as part of it. Great place to have fun. Very crowded on the weekends, but worth it for the price!",Secondavenue
20,Very expensive,"This place could get a 5 star review if they had staff that acted like they cared (go-carts staff, plus boat guy chaining up all boats to hang out with go-cart guys) and were not so astronomically expensive. I went with twin 4 year olds and 2 adults and with games, outside and lunch spent over $200! It was $100 just for go-carts, mini golf and boats. Going inside to play is a fortune. I will go to 6-flags next time I want to spend that kind of money.",sportspup
40,Nice Stop With Kids,"My three-year-old son loves water fountains! So the giant water fountain that it's a part of their miniature golf course cut my sons I as we drove by. My wife and I made the trip to visit the large antique mall next door and we're about to set off to find an ice cream place for my son because he was so good. What we found was much much more!Outside this family fun center has go carts, miniature golf and even bumper boats! Well we didn't actually do the miniature golf, we walked over through the course so my son could get close to the water fountains. The golf course looks really fun!Inside there is an arcade that also includes a handful of kiddie rides. I loaded a card with just $10 and my son was able to go on all the rides and even play I handful of games. He had a wonderful time. To top it off, they have a restaurant that has an ice cream place! So we were able to get the ice cream we had seeked out.The staff is friendly and the inside area is all very clean and has many cool details to look at. Outside could've been better kept. I did notice quite a few cobwebs when walking up the stairs. But on the whole, this is a wonderful place to take the kids for a treat!",Michael T
30,Getting smaller,"Every year for the past 19 years, my son and I have still always tried to make it an enjoyable venture, however with the amount of unsupervised kids its getting hectic.",Opie T
20,Just so so,Not the biggest or best kids entertainment spot. The usual mix of things to do. If you live in the area it's a place to hit on a bad weather day. Definitely not a drive to destination.,1kenny
40,"OK, but only for a half day at most.",We were in the area (primarily a Six Flags trip) so figured we'd pop in for a bit and try the go karts and such. Overall it was pretty good but not great. The karts are ok but my son's died out halfway through so on our first ride he ended up watching for half of it. The batting cages were pretty fun and the inside arcade games are good as well but it doesn't take long to chew through a hundred dollars or so even with just the two of us. Staff was friendly and helpful and the place was clean and well organized so all in all worth the money. Probably a one stop place for us but if you have pre teens likely a real hit. Enjoy!,Yenom99
40,Unexpected day trip,"We took my kids here for the day, Go carts were fun and also the different arcades were fun. the only issue is that some of the Arcades weren't working and it just took the Credits from our card. They should have a notice stating when they aren't working. Overall, this was a nice place to take the kids.",angiepangie734
20,Run down and it shows in appearance and attn to detail,We didn't have the greatest time here - we came on a day it had been raining and I was told the mini golf would be open... it wasn't. While we were outside an employee told us the whole outdoor area was closed activity wise. We decided to at least walk around check out the options.. the staff knew we were remaining outside and was cool with it. So were we til we were LOCKED OUT and stuck outside. Tried banging on the door and calling - it was a little girl who finally rescued us! Jeez! They had put up a barrier and locked the door... but not before ensuring no one was out there. Manager Laura was apologetic. She did give us passes to return for mini golf - I'll update once we use these. My son was going to do the laser maze and freaked out due to the fog in there ... there weren't enough kids for laser tag so it was just a wash. Pretty wasted visit because there just wasn't a whole lot to do. I think the games are overly priced but that's my opinion. Prizes looked pretty cool. I think this place isn't as rad as it use to be but I plan to return and will update then.,msjr_01
50,Fun,"I have been bringing my son here for the last couple of years to play the miniature golf courses. There are two of them, one is easy and the other is more of a challenge. The service has always been great, and we have created many forever memories. The arcade isn't bad either, but I cannot comment of the food because we have never ordered any. If you are a AAA member, it allows 2 people to golf for the price of one.",William J
50,Birthday Party,"I took both grandsons here to attend a birthday party. This was my first visit not theirs. I enjoyed watching them and friends having a great time. They loved the laser tag and the numerous electronic games available to play. I did notice 6 games that were out of service and was told the technician was not there to fix them. There were numerous other games so no real inconvenience. The party was for indoor use only. They do have other outdoor activities like a batting cage, go karts, bumper boats and putt-putt golf. This can entertain child's for many hours. Be advised it can get expense when you have to keep loading their game cards with points so they can continue to play games. If your children haven't been here it's worth checking it out.",WMSCV
50,Fun fun fun,I love coming to this place. It's super fun on a kid level.... Meaning the go carts are good but love love love the batting cages. I love the fact they have a few older games so I can be a bit nostalgic and enjoy myself. Great place to have fun at.,Kung Pao K
50,Several activities both inside and out.,"This was a great place to stop with kids until our hotel was ready. We participated in the miniature golf, batting cage and restaurant. The food was very good.",pkween

What a perfect day....a lot of fun. Go karts, boat blasting, laser tag, video games...golf course we did not have time for. What a day. Had a blast....and that is an understatement.

40,Kids had a great time!,"I took 4 kids here as our last summer outing before school started. It is a bit pricey but memorable. We purchase the 3 hours of ""unlimited"" play outside. I recommend doing the bumper boats and carts first and save the golfing for the last. If you sign in for golf before your 3 hours is up you can easily stretch your day into 4 hours of play.",rwheeler
20,The arcade has much to desired!,They have fairly limited arcade games. Most are not what is a part of current technology. Four times during our play time we had to be refunded due to game malfunctions. You would literally need to spend a pretty penny to get enough tickets for anything worthwhile. As you have more control over miniature golf and the batting cage... Go for that.,Diana B
30,Fun spot,"This is a fun place for younger folks...mini golf, laser tag, go carts, and arcade games. You can also get ice cream ....overall a family can have fun if they are willing to pay for it....things are a bit pricey.",Cherie P
20,Could Be Better,"This place could be a gold mine, but the prices are too high and not worth the experience. The mini golf was fair, not well lit for night time playing. The arcade games are over priced. The place looks like an step up from Chucke Cheeses, but no way near a Dave and Busters.",Simpleguy22
40,Fun no matter your age!,"I'm 21 years old and I love to go here to go mini-golfing, go-carts, and some ice cream for a quick, mid-week date night! If you use your AAA card, you get a discount on the mini-golfing, too!",Kristen F

Batting cages, bumper boats, go karts, laser tag, and an arcade. I went to college nearby and frequently went with groups of friends be cause it was a good, cheap way to spend the time together. Not sure how kids like it, but I'd say it's worth it for College of the Canyons or CalArts students!",Nina S
30,Only 'Ok',It was ok. Our kids enjoyed it for about an hour but they got bored since it's pretty small. For the money I wasn't overly impressed but it didn't totally suck either.,Adamurican
10,"Not worth the money, average $2.00 per game.","Old and run-down, even the kids wanted to leave after 30 minutes. $6.31 for a shake!! Only one of 5 batting cages worked.",Kim44444
40,Great local fun spot,"I like the cars and rock climbing the best. The water ride is fun, too, but be prepared to get wet as other riders are shooting water at you! They also have miniature golf and other activities.It has a great, sit-down restaurant/ice cream parlor. Perfect for birthday parties.",Roverette
40,family entertainment in the santa clarita valley,"Mountasia has miniature golf, an arcade , go carts and a few other attractions. There is a Farrels restaurant / ice cream parlor on site.",wvillamil
50,great mini golf course,"This is a nice, well-run, clean, family-oriented mini golf course. It's challenging enough to make it interesting. It has the best water feature of any mini golf course I've ever played. The inside food area is organized like an old-fashioned soda shop. It reminded me of something you might see at Downtown Disney in Disneyland.",blacey1
40,Arcade Fun for the Family,"We took my 9 year old son here for his 9th birthday last month.This place is loaded with things to do. The inside has an awesome laser tag arena and an expansive arcade. The rock wall is fine, but situated strangely and not very exciting - your kid would probably like to do it once, but probably not more than two times. The laser tag was awesome. This is worth the unlimited package. My kids loved it.For the inside you can buy per attraction($8 ea) or for a flat rate of $25 they get an all access pass, which includes several arcade games, but not everything. I felt like that was pricey for a family of 6 - so we sprang for a couple of the passes and then paid per attraction.The card system was awkward. Make sure you understand it before wasting money. You have to load cards for all the games and activities. Each card costs a couple of bucks before you even add anything to it. Make sure to save and reuse cards and don't get more than you need.The outside stuff seemed great - mini golf, water boats and go carts - I will have to update my review once we make it back for those items. Same on the pricing - $25 for outdoor access pass, etc.We sprung for a meal in the attached Farrell's Ice Cream place. I did not realize there are two ways to order - there is an express area to order from, then you aren't allowed to sit in the restaurant. Either way the food is extremely expensive.On the plus side, they do a very special birthday thingie-do - with drum and music and getting the birthday person involved. That was really nice for my son.My overall review I was torn between 3 and four stars because I felt it was very expensive for what you got. So, a lot of fun, but pricey.",Tasiadoo
30,Good for the preteen set,"Wall climbing, boats, cars(these are ok for teens) and a boring mini golf. Good for young kids for a party but by the time they get to Jr. high they want something else. Can get pricey unless you find some coupons.",Laura R
50,Great Birthday Spot,"This place was just wonderful for my son's 9th Birthday. Farrell's Ice Cream is just awesome. If you haven't been, then you probably didn't grow up in southern California. Every kid should have one birthday that is this much fun, with a huge mound of ice cream, sparklers attached, and then burn off all the energy playing laser tag, bumper boats, go karts, and more laser tag. We had a small group of about 25 people, which was just perfect.",Antrim8
10,Dirty Used Ice Cream Spoon with lipstick in my Ice Cream Cup,"While our kids got hungry, we decided to take a break from playing the arcade games and the outdoor activities. We settled at ""Farrell's"" the inhouse restaurant. We ordered food, drinks, and Ice Cream. In my Ice Cream cup there was one used little ice cream spoon full of lipstick. I took it to the counter. The manager on duty apologized for the unpleasant scene. My wife and I got discussed, we decided to leave.Look twice in your Ice Cream cup to see what unpleasant surprises are awaiting you!",Gendy2014
40,Lots of fun things for everyone.,We spent an hour & a half playing mini golf and then stopped in the restaurant for sundaes. There are also go karts & electronic games & a climbing wall inside. Time & money well spent. Make sure you get their club card for future discounts.,Dr. Bob
20,Bring your earplugs,This is a mini-arcade with some other activities. Usually mobbed by scout troops and other groups with minimal supervision. Worthless prizes. A complete money-sink,Sarita

30,Kids Fun,"When we must think about things for young children to do Mountasia surfaces on top of our list. Essentially it is a good place for children age 5 to 18 to enjoy themselves; although, when the price is considered if there are other active choices I would consider other options.We tried to get ice-cream finding the prices to be ""outrageous"" for small town New York, but tolerable; however, when there was no seating, because parties were planned (but not in session), then I am not so sure this is such a good place to take young children. Of course the issues are always what can we do to have our children enjoy some activity, so by default Mountasia wins, but not because it is such a good place.",travelinman04
40,Fun place,Went there last week I like that they had food. The price is worth it only if you are there for more then 2 hours cause u pay 13 to 16 for unlimited games about 40 for unlimited everything including go carts which is fun. I also like the fact they have the dance dance revolution 2 different types I love that game!! And the basketball hoops.,wmitchell123
30,Place even adults can Enjoy,"Most think its for kids, but as an adult, my family we all enjoy it, yes you have to have patience on some of the games,, and its ticket prize ratio is out of this world, but my Son & I enjoy the competitive games, and atmosphere.",Opie T
40,good place to take the young'ns,"Very helpful staff, a nice variety of stuff, the place is very good. They would be excellent if the golf courses weren't so shabby, but kids will still have fun on them even if the adults frown at the signs of neglect. The laser tag is fun, go karts fun, the games inside are fun, has a Farrels inside which kids like, lots of fun center stuff, good variety",Michael G
40,Great Place to Let Kids Play,"We came here with our three year old to just let him burn off some excess energy and that is what he did. We played some miniature golf and then had dinner in the diner. My wife and I grew up with Farrell's and so it was more of a nostalgic visit for us and fun to see our kids eat here and enjoy the ""Pig Trough"" as we did when we were much younger. The food is standard diner amusement park food. Nothing too special, but yet still good. The miniature golf was fun and since we came on a Friday evening (we were told their slow time) we were able to take our time and allow our child to run and play. Overall it was a bunch of fun and a place that we would visit again.",unathan1
50,Fun Place - We went for the Ice Cream!,We dropped in for Ice Cream at Farrells - the on-premises restaurant.We didn't play games but we plan to go back. The game area is a nice setup!

40,Good place for family fun,"Great place for birthday party, etc. Not good for really young kids, too noisy. Our 8+12 year olds had loads of fun. Staff seemed nice, general operations were smooth, things looked properly maintained, no safety hazards. Felt like it was a good value overall. Other places are bigger, but for an afternoon this place means good times for kids.",Rockrotator
40,"Great fun, avoid the food","Went here to kill a day and had a blast. I got the unlimited indoor use (includes climbing wall, laser tag, and about half of the arcade) plus 1 outdoor activity which i used on go karting. had a wonderful time. im accustomed to ultra zone laser tag in sherman oaks which is quite high end as laser tag goes, so i wasnt all that impressed with their arena, but found it highly enjoyable all the same.the go karts were lots of fun, as was the climbing on wall and video games. all excellent.the reason it got four stars instead of five: BEWARE OF The FOOD. i got a hamburger at their diner and had awful gastronomical problems the rest of the night. really awful especially since i had a long drive ahead of me.Tip: if you go late at night on a weeknight, it might be best. i went with my friend around 7 pm monday night and we effectively had the place to ourselves. got to play a six-person game of laser tag and one-on-one both of which were heaps of fun.",NomadicTendencies1

I like Farrell's. It's a nice change from cheap fast food you get most places. It costs more but the quality is always good. I'd recommend avoiding weekends, it gets crazy busy. It has friendly staff and it's a safe enviorment.",Luciesweet
40,Fun for kids!,"I just read the reviews on Mountasia and was really surprised because I was just there this past weekend and had a great time. I was impressed because the bathrooms were so clean which is a big deal for parents with small children! And, I interacted with an adult manager that stopped by our table to say hi and see how we were doing (at Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor inside Mountasia! Didn't even know there was a Farrell's - too much fun and great memories from when I was a kid!). There were a lot of teenage staff but I expect that at an amusement place. They were nice kids that seemed to know what they were doing.",FunMomLA
20,They make money...who gets it?,"I agree 100% with the last post. We've been twice since we've moved up to SCV, and it's worn it's welcome. It's seriously in need of reconditioning, the staff is young (this isn't a bad thing, but when they're young and irresponsible, it IS a bad thing), and the place sometimes smells like a wet dog. For what they charge and what you get, it's almost worth it just to pony up the extra $$ and head over to Magic Mountain.",Satchriani
10,Gone Downhill!,"Mountasia provides a great assortment of things to do. There are games, bumper boats, mini golf, batting cages and even a Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor. It used to be a lot of fun.The place has gone downhill over the past couple years to the point that we do not go anymore. The golf courses are in serious disrepair. After a year or so of being dry, they did finally get the waterfall/stream filled with water. The course lacks all ""fun."" There are no windmills or obstacles, just very basic holes with peeling fake grass and dirty white carpet to simulate sand. For golf, go out to the mini golf course in Ventura.The bumper boats are fun as are the go-carts, though the 52"" height for drivers might keep many kids off of the go-carts.The games are seriously overpriced. Many cost 3 and 4 tokens to play for a minute or two, this adds up quickly. There have been several times we went that a large percentage of the games were not working.The staff really could care less. What should they expect when they only hire a bunch of kids to run the place?We ate once at the Farrell's and tried to on two other occasions. I get better service at Denny's. The food was very poor. On two occasions, we tried to eat there and had to wait forever to be seated despite having empty tables (all of them were dirty and had to be cleaned). When we were seated, it was impossible to get someone to take our order and after waiting long enough, we just went elsewhere.",larmcc
