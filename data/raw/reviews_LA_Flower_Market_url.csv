50,"Amazing flowers, nice friendly vendors!","The LA flower market is a joy to walk around. There is easy parking and Poppy and Rose is a wonderful organic restaurant for breakfast or lunch right opposite.The vendors are friendly and helpful and if you need flowers for an event you can check out my daughter, Tayah Howard at @orignelsewhere she does events and runs floral workshops for group of friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoehoward1152
50,Come early and bring a cart to take home all the flowers you will buy!,"I've lived in Los Angeles all my life and this was my first visit to the Flower Mart, it will not be my last! We visited on a Saturday and did not arrive until 10:30, there was still good variety but I suggest arriving earlier for the freshest selection. Between the large number of vendors selling pretty much any type of flower (and plant) you can think of to the vases - you won't know what way to turn. There are actually several buildings and the nominal $1 entry fee gets you into all of them. Take a walk around to check things out before purchasing - we found a fairly wide range of prices. The quality of the flowers appears to be good, those I purchased are still fresh three days later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebPLosAngeles_CA
50,Amazing experience that you would never think about,"Do something different and amazing for the senses. Incredible variety of flowers, amazing smell. We spent a good hour in our last morning in LA as our hotel was not far and it was really worth it. Prices are very good too if you are intending to buy. Took amazing pictures. You would not expect that in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraD1930
50,Never let old tradition die,Took my daughter to downtown to show her what my grandparents showed us as kids. Great place for Valentine's day gifts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidjrdlj8
50,All the Flowers,"This is flower heaven and you 100% should go if you’re in Downtown LA. There are 1000s of Flowers and plants to choose from and it’s only a few dollars to enter (flower purchases are separate, of course).To me this felt like an authentic local experience, so if that’s your jam when traveling, the flower market is for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carawasthere
40,Wedding Flowers,"This is the best place to get any kind of flowers you want. Super cute! Great and nice people.I expected prices to be a lot cheaper, because I heard a lot of people brag about the cheap flowers but.. one peony was 3.50$ which is pretty expensive.Other than that it is so worth it, especially if you go to buy flowers for a weddings or other parties.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francescaknall
50,surprisingly enjoyable,We visited the various flower market outlets as a large family group and we all enjoyed the experience for various reasons.You will see things for the first time and the younger ones really have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dave22362
50,if you are looking for a romantic but free/cheap bonding experience... look no further,"it took us a little bit longer than i had planned to find parking and get to the actual ""flower district"", but you definitely know it once you're there! its beautiful and the ambience is very rustic and natural with everything around being in the dollar range and you can wander around just looking at everything! if you have allergies you better bring yourself a care package to handle the wide range of breeds...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milvetmac
50,Such a happy place!,"It's hard not to come down to the flower district and not feel happiness upon seeing all of the beautiful flowers and plants. Every time my father visits from out of state, we come here early in the morning and buy a few bouquets of flowers. We enjoy looking at all the varieties of flowers and plants. The flower prices are wholesale so you can get a nice flower arrangement for around $6. A dozen roses might run around $12. Aside from the great prices, it's just a unique experience. Anyone who loves color, life, and gardens will appreciate coming here. It does cost $1 to enter and parking is usually about $6 flat rate on weekends. Best tip is to go early like 6am. Most shops close by noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
50,if you love flowers - go,This has to be one of the largest flower markets in the world (at least that is open to the public). it is filled with so many unique flowers and plants it is well worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Consultantgal
50,If you love flowers - you can't go wrong for $1,"Full disclosure - my family helped to start this place many years ago - though I'm not in the business now. Go early, pay $1 to enter and I'll bet you'll leave with some beautiful plants and/or flowers. I recently visited - I'd forgotten how beautiful the place can be (when you're not working there!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gosaka
50,Prepare to be dazzled!,"I adore this place!Check their website before going as the entry hours for the general public will vary depending on the day (closed Sundays) . There is metered street parking right outside or you can pay $6 to leave your car in the parking lot where there is always an attendant. The stall holders accept credit card but cash is always preferred. $2 will get you entry into both of the warehouses where the produce is sold. There is a restroom inside and also an atm.If you love potted orchids you will go crazy here. Every size and colour imaginable for as little as $5. In addition to the common cut flowers such as roses, lilies and gerberas, there are many other varieties of blooms with fascinating shapes and vibrant colours. You can also find foliage and a vast array of potted plants of every size for your home. If you need a vase, pots and random plant accessories such as driftwood and moss - this is the place!Don't forget to peek into the plant shops lining the streets surrounding the actual warehouses. There are amazing bargains there as well.We arrived around 8.30am and left at 10am with a car full of plants!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Runbot
50,Sooo many flowers,"We couldn't buy any flowers on our visit because we were sightseeing all day but it was fun and therapeutic to look at and smell all of the flowers. I enjoyed seeing the varieties and just the sheer volume of all of those buckets of fresh cut flowers. Worth the few bucks it cost to get in. One of the buildings we were in had an escalator to the second floor which had a giant store of floral accessories. I thought that would be a total snore (like a bunch of green foam and wire) but it was full of beautifully arranged holiday decor scenes in the entrance and aisles and aisles of all kinds of crafty and decorating stuff. This is a gritty part of downtown so I recommend driving. We parked above a craft store down the street and they validated parking if you spent a certain amt in their store. Also, you must come in the morning to see the flowers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mishmosh_1
50,Fresh and cheap,"Make sure to get here early, soon as they open. First do a walk around as there are a lot of suppliers with good prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thezworld
40,Stop and Smell the Roses!,"If you love the smell of fresh cut flowers and the sights of bursting color, then you really should consider this a fantastic botanical tour! The prices are phenomenally cheap! So cheap, you could pick up a dozen roses to decorate your hotel room without feeling the least bit guilty for the indulgence. And even if you don't want to buy any, it is certainly fun to breeze through the large, open doors and simply see what arrangements are offered.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,For Floral Enthusiasts,"If you are interested in seeing fresh flowers or if you want to buy fresh flowers then this is the place for you to visit!There are large varieties of flowers, some are seasonal and others are imported.

The entrance fee is only $1 so it's very budget friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reader_girl932
40,Floral fun,Something new to do in Los Angeles. Great winter activity. Feels like summer.Try something new in la. Be there before noon. Very inexpensive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/489audreys
40,Beautiful Flowers,On our trip we visited the flower market. The fragrance of the flowers was just heavenly! There was such an assortment of flowers and orchids and these were all at unbelievable prices. It was quite an eye opener to see such beautiful flowers available at those prices. It was a really wonderful experience walking through that maze of flowers stalls and getting such a whiff of amazing fragrances!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MinhajAliKhan
40,A nice way to spend a half hour,"We chanced upon the flower market as the vendors were setting up on a Saturday morning. Admission was $1 per person. We wandered the market and looked at everything from flowers that were almost dead and intended to be used as scattered petals to beautiful, vibrant orchids. One vendor had a sign up forbidding photos, but the others assured us that this was the exception. No one else cared. Because it was our anniversary, my husband bought me a dozen roses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toodycat
40,What a fragrant outing!,"So my niece was in town and wanted to see something she could not find in her small town. We decided to go to the flower market on a Saturday. We parked in the structure which cost $4. On Saturday there is also a farmers market on the street between the buildings, so the street is blocked off. One building was free to walk through and the second one charged $1 per person. We all enjoyed the selection of flowers, succulents, vases and other things that you would need to make an arrangement. Although we did not intend to buy anything at first, the prices and selection were too much to resist! My niece really loved it and I think I should come here more often. The only reason I give this four stars out of 5 is that the market is not fancy, just a true no frills market and they have only morning hours so do not go too late or many of the vendors will be closing up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Apamperedtraveler
40,Cool!,"Really nice place to visit if you like flowers. To glam up your hotelroom, or just as gifts, you'll find everything here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SentinaS
30,Flowers,We lived near the flower district so we thought we would check this out. If you are looking for flowers for any occasion this is the spot to come. The flower district is several blocks long and has nothing but flowers to offer you. I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and seeing all the shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Byrondwyer
50,"Off the beaten trail, a must do","This was one of my favorite things to do while visiting LA. The flower mart is in a warehouse in downtown LA, and is a unique experience that lacks the usual touristy crowds at other LA attractions. I have never seen so many flowers for sale in my life, all at bargain basement prices. It was so interesting to see people buying them in quantity for their own weddings; apparently, people working on movie sets purchase their flowers here as well. A really authentic place of great beauty....I highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691sharons
50,A beautiful way to start the day,"After a very early arrival in LA we decided to check out the flower district. This place is open from 08-12 each day for us commoners and actually opens at 0200 for the florists and those in the trade. 2 dollars in admission and incredible selection and prices throughout. This place is 2 floors of flowers on both side of the street and 2 hours is just not enough time. Honestly we spent what we had planned to but we left with more flowers than we ever imagined. Everything was beautiful and there was so much to choose from, we just decided to go crazy with it and filled our hotel room. We had a lot of fun with it and really turned it into an unforgettable experience.Flowers aren't the only thing here, you can buy vases and arrangement supplies if that's your thing but the flowers were the unforgettable thing. Surprise your wife with $100 worth of flowers and she'll never forget it.The next 2-3 blocks to the west are the garment district so if you want fabric to go with it they have everything there as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738JohnK
40,Flower Market,"Unless there's a funeral, I usually don't think about flowers very much. But I do have a warm memory of the Flower Market. The Market cheered me up at a time when I badly needed a lift. It was my first time in L.A. I'd arrived on a Greyhound bus in the wee hours. No city looks good at four a.m., but Los Angeles was making a particularly bad first impression. This was many years ago, back when the bus depot was located in an old office building near skid row. Half the vagrants in L.A. seemed to be drifting aimlessly in and out of the station lobby. Some poor psychotic derelict was there, engaged in a life-or-death brawl with a gang of imaginary assailants. Leering winos ambled past. Near the doors a guy was lying face-down on the floor, not moving. Out on the street, I suddenly sensed that I was being followed. I turned and saw a police car inching along the curb behind me. The cop in the passenger seat had a face just like a Mayan carving, and he was giving me a long, hard stare. You know you're in a tough place when even the police scare you. I didn't know anything about the geography of L.A. at the time and I wandered into the industrial area east of the central business district. The streets were dark, deserted and depressing. But just then I walked past the open doorway of the Flower Market. Joseph Mitchell, the writer, would go down to the Fulton Fish Market when he was having a bad night. The activity in the market would cheer him up. The Flower Market had the same effect on me. The place was a little oasis of purpose and order in a dark sea of anomie and chaos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/booradley2
50,Quality flowers at a low price!,"LOVE this place! Admission is $2 ($1 on Saturdays) and go early! Everything goes fast!My mom is awesome at flower arranging. So she made the centerpiece, boutonnieres, and bouquets for both my wedding and my sister's wedding.There are so many vendors there. Seriously where else can you get 2 dozen ROSES for $12!?!? Or a huge bouquet of flowers for $10??If you find a vendor you like, call them before you go down! One time my mom went and found so many roses in the color she needed. Then we came again the following weekend and he only had 3 dozen of that color we needed. We bought ALL of them and some poor woman after us wanted that same color.. HAHAH sorry lady - we bought all of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharleneC393
40,Prepare for visual and scent experience!!!,"Decided this was going to be part of my Downtown LA experience-my husband opted out of this. I grabbed a coffee and asked my hotel desk about walking to the Flower Mart. They suggested I cab it down there due to so many homeless being on the street, It was 6:30 am as I headed down 7th Street. I decided to walk down as far as I could go and would turn around if it started feeling dicey. There were homeless on the street but tragically they were still asleep on their cardboard and niches. Most of the people on the street at that time were those catching the bus for work.. And to be honest, it was still a little uncomfortable but I forged ahead after thinking about turning around a couple of times.When I arrived it was a visual and scent experience. I'm more of a live plant person, but it was still spectacular to see all different kinds of flowers. It had every kind of cut flower that one has seen in floral arrangements and others I had never seen. It is several large warehouses that are cool in temperature and emit a sweet flower scent. I enjoy succulents and found 2 areas that sold them for a good price. I purchased 9 small ones that the proprieter put in a box for me. There are also areas to buy vases and other floral items.As I headed back up 7th Street with my box of succulents, there were now many, many homeless on the street. I didn't feel necessarily unsafe but my hotel was 0.8 miles and when I saw a bus I hopped on. The bus driver commented on my box of succulents and we had a very nice conversation about his garden and plants all the way down 7th Street. At Hope Street I got off and handed him one of my succulents. I enjoyed the Flower Mart with all the sights and scents but sometimes it's not only the attraction that makes travel fascinating, but the people you meet along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/labonvoyer
50,AMAZING Place,"This place is a trip through flower heaven. Prices are AMAZING and there is every type of flower possible. Also plants, orchids, etc. I have purchased HUGE bouquets of roses with star gazer lily in the middle, lovely greenery and babies breath. Cost --$15. It can be broken up into two or three large size bouquets in vases at home. Go early, wear walking shoes as it's enormous and be prepared for a visual, sensory and amazing low cost experience of a lifetime. EVERYONE should go at least once. If you do it will be a regular experience when you need flowers and want them inexpensively.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imtonif
40,Flower Market Visit a Real Treat,"The Los Angeles Flower Market on the east side of Wall Street and the Southern California Flower Market on the west side of Wall Street (facing each other), between 7th and 8th streets, are HUGE and the experience of walking through them is like being in a gigantic candy store. Spectacular colors, many different varieties of flowers and plants, shapes and textures, combined with the energy of many visitors (Fridays are really busy) just seem to make the place come alive, add an air of excitement and, as with flowers in any setting, make you feel pure joy in the presence of such beauty. The public is invited after 8 a.m. Check the website for special days and holiday hours: [-]LAFlowerDistrict[-]. Or visit the newsletter for the Los Angeles Flower Market - [-]bloominnews[-] . An absolute delight. Take your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyBlooms
