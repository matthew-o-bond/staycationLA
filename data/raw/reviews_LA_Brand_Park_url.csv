50,One of the coolest libraries in the country,We stopped here while sightseeing locally - mostly to see the public library in the old Brand house. The gates into the park are really neat and the library in the old house with its Moorish architecture is quite striking. Inside the library has occupied the old house leaving the old architectural details in place and decorating it with beautiful art. The library is full or comfortable furniture and would be a great place to just hang out and work. This is worth a visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeofJx
40,"""Doctor's House"" - 1 od 2 remaining Victorians in Glendale","Written before on Brand Park itself, this review is only for Doctor's House - ONLY open Sunday 2-4. $5 cash donation suggested - they don't take cc. Pretty little (7-8 rooms) preserved house with period correct interior and a lot of detail. More, really than the guide had time for - I would love to stumble on this sometime when I am a solo tour guest :) As it was, with a group of maybe 7-8 (a large multi-generational latino family and time for translation, grandma resting in a chair that was 'no touch', etc.) the docent had her hands full. The kind of place I might return to, armed with a little more information and family questions - the ladies who have been doing this for years have a lot more knowledge than scratching the surface gives them a chance to impart. Be sure to swing through the Brand library - itself a wonderful interior space. Include the art gallery - sometimes interesting, sometimes a dud (February 2020 installation a dud - to me anyway)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
40,Beautiful park,It's a nice big park and the library is very impressive. The down side is that Japanese Tea House and Victorian Doctor House are not open on Saturday. You can not visit these two location at the park at on same day. too bad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culture476369
50,Library Building alone is worth a trip,"Brand Park is an extensive park in Glendale. The main area has a branch of the Glendale Library (only music, art, and children‚Äôs books in this one), children‚Äôs playground, Japanese tea garden, a Victorian doctor‚Äôs office moved here from elsewhere in Glendale, and playing fields. The park then backs unto extensive trails of various difficulties that go up the Verdugo Mountains. Leashed dogs are allowed on these, and ours has certainly enjoyed them. Our granddaughter stays in the swings for what seem to be hours. A real gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/franciscogX7190AH

50,Lovely Park!,"I live about .7 of a mile from Brand, and go there frequently to hike, work out, walk around and snooze. Feel so fortunate to have such a great park so close to home.

40,very nice accidental discovery,"Staying in a local hotel, conference ended and I needed something to do - this looked nice. It was. Well maintained park, interesting library set in the original house with reading rooms echoing old elegance. Nifty little art gallery; paintings et al by locals - or at least non-name artists for purchase if you like (but mostly serious prices). Best part though is the hiking trail - I'd call it challenging for a day tripper, but if you pace yourself you can go all the way to the top - in sneakers. Better be a little limber though. Thoroughly enjoyed the view and feeling of accomplishment. Pretty quiet up there, but there will be another hiker along eventually if you do get into trouble, lol. Victorian house also on grounds - very limited hours (Sunday).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW

Brand, who was a Real Estate and a developer of the city of Glendale. The house has been restored to it's original Victorian beauty and has various rooms to seat and read or work quietly.

50,Don't Tell Anyone About It!,"I swear, this is a top 20 well-kept secret of Los Angeles. Let's keep it that way. Brand was a genius when he left his property to the city; otherwise it would be covered in ugly development that only the rich could afford. The park is huge; has loads of things for young kids and families. The trails go up in the hills - the real ones you see driving down the 134. You can go up and over the range. Some of the non-paved paths will kick your butt, but watch out for snakes or mountain lions. What L.A. looked like before we ruined it. Check out the Brand family cemetary and Brand's tombstone.

40,Mysterious Brand Family Cemetery,"Brand Park has many interesting features, but I am focusing here on possibly the creepiest part.Take a walk up the road behind the park, and within a quarter mile or so you'll encounter the Brand family cemetery, a private fenced-in plot topped by a stone pyramid tomb. Watch for the palm trees, as you might miss the cemetery for the surrounding brush. You'll also need to walk up some stone steps to reach the perimeter fence. It‚Äôs easy enough to aim your camera through the chain-link fence for some interesting pictures of the 20-odd graves of Leslie Brand‚Äôs family. People have been scooting under the fence for a closer look, as you can see by the scooped-out area under the chain link; again, this is private property so please respect the grounds. You can get very nice pictures from the outside. Not to be a nag, just sayin.'This little corner of the hills is fairly gloomy, almost oppressively so; the cemetery is draped with dusty, drooping eucalyptus and palm branches, so the haunted feeling is inescapable (and within the nearby Brand Library it is said one may be treated to ‚Äúa moaning presence.‚Äù) It's very easy here to feel like you've walked into a 19th century photograph, and it makes you think about old funeral services and long-forgotten lives; within minutes you can be overtaken by a real sense of melancholy. Time to go back to the grassy park and see live people -- or continue hiking up the road and enjoy the parts of the Verdugo Hills that escaped the recent La Tuna fire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler

50,Glendale's hidden historical park,"I have been going to Brand Park for almost 40 years. My grandmother used to bring me here when I was a kid and I'd climb on the rocket ship slide for hours while she did Tai Chi under the Sycamores. Now as an adult I come here for Saturday morning boot camp, hiking the surrounding Verdugo Mountain trails, and chillaxing in the afternoon. On any given day during ""magic hour"" you'll find people doing photo shoots on the steps of the Brand Library so that should tell you how picturesque the park is and on occasion I've seen deer wandering near the upper playground so you may even find some nice wildlife to interact with. On the grounds you'll also find The Doctor's House and the Brand Library, both of which are historic locations. This park is definitely a spot for locals to enjoy a lazy afternoon or little league game.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller

50,Brand Library,"Brand park was Mr. Brands' official house way back when. Its got great historical pictures inside and just got a new makeover. The hiking behind the Brand house is really magical. If you are so inclined to make up those hills you can have a glimpse of the graveyard ""yes its real"" where Mr and Mrs. Brand and Mr. and Mrs. Stocker and the Central's are laid to rest. I also remember some really healthy bamboo growing. I have run into some pretty questionable people from time to time. My advice get some mace and when hiking where long pants. You never know poison oak, bugs and snakes live on these trails. It definitely a nice walk on a cool morning as it gets really hot up there on the mountain. I never hike alone the buddy system always is the best way to go and don't forget your water. You can sit at the top and enjoy the view if the smog permits. I suggest a picnic on the sprawling lawns below. It gets crowded on weekends with the usual bridal parties and the photographers that follow. Enjoy, have fun and keep your eyes open!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstevenss

50,A magical find... a must see!,"Okay so this was a truly wonderful surprise. I‚Äôve lived in and around this area (that is, Los Angeles, which encompasses most of the world) since birth, and yet, in all these years, I have never, ever driven through the gates of this mystical ethereal park to visit! However, a friend of mine was doing a reading on a book he just wrote, which was being occupied by a true professional concert pianist. This is right in the foothills. And when your drive through the arch-way gates, you feel like you‚Äôve died and gone to heaven. Sadly, this kind of beauty and peace, and manicured gardens, lawns and trees, is usually only found is old style cemeteries. And I must say, my first reaction was that I had accidentally driven into one of the various huge Forest Lawn‚Äôs that are situated not far away. I kept looking for tombstones and mausoleums, and maybe even the spirit of Michael Jackson and Walt Disney walking around holding his frozen head. But no‚Ä¶ this is a public park, complete with wonderful nooks and crannies, and big lawn areas, baseball courts, picnic tables, and at the far end, beautiful buildings that house an art museum, a small concert hall, and several large spaces for large artistic installations or musical exhibitions. There is also a room with a platform stage (where I watched the reading and amazing piano concert). This park has regular exhibits, shows, dances, and musical events through the year. I love places like this that have been untouched for so long, and maintained so lovingly and beautifully, that as you enter, a sort of ‚ÄúTwilight Zone‚Äù moment occurs, and you are suddenly transported to an early time in Glendale, or LA‚Äôs history‚Ä¶ and the modern world truly disappears around you (suddenly your iPhone seems like an anachronistic annoyance)‚Ä¶ and you suddenly are at peace in a much simpler, innocent time. Come out, just to walk round, and explore. These beautiful spots in LA are disappearing even as we speak, like glaciers melting up North‚Ä¶ so enjoy them now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heywoodf307

40,Historic park,"I've been coming to this park for just short of 40 years and even though my interests in the park have changed throughout the decades, it's a lovely hidden gem in the Verdugo Hills. My most recent visits have been for bootcamp on Saturday mornings but as a child I used to frequent the jungle gym and grassy areas while my grandmother would do Tai Chi under the sycamore trees. On any given day you'll see photographers taking wedding/engagement photos in front of the historic library or with the view of Glendale and Burbank in the background so obviously the beauty of the place speaks for itself. I've even spotted deer a few times coming down from the hill. If it's good enough for deer, it's good enough for me. My only criticism is sometimes parking can be difficult if the baseball diamonds are in full use.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller

50,Great hiking trails and also great place to either watch or play soccer,"This is a very nice medium sized park that has very good hiking trails that lead to the top of the hill behind the park. Couple of the trails are very challenging, and if one is not in a very good shape and walks very fast, there is a likelihood that he or she will start feeling sick abode two thirds up the hill. But, this is nothing to be worried about - it is just lactic acid and body's way of saying that it needs rest. So, once one rests for about 15 or 20 minutes, everything goes back to normal again. There is also a back way trail which is very nice and allot less challenging. Once at the top of the hill, one can enjoy the panoramic views of Burbank and Glendale. Also, during weekends local Armenian and Hispanic men play soccer at Brand Park. Those games are really interesting to watch or even participate in.

A wonderful place for a short walk and easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464PeterB464

50,Great for birders.,"Park for free. Bathrooms, water fountain, and vending machine available. Walk up past the old doctor's house and keep going. There are scrub jays, warblers, quail, orioles, acorn woodpeckers, hummingbirds, wrens, and more. The walk is uphill, so wear good shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandaw974
50,Spectacular View,"This is a must see park. The landscape is fab, the view of the city is even better when you take a hike in the mountains just north of the library. You simply must see this to believe it. The library is currently being renovated, however, it is one of the great wonders of Glendale, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamW222
40,A bit of Glendale History,"If you live in Glendale and have never visited Brand Park, you are really missing out. There is a lot of history associated with the main building as it is a mansion that was owned by the prominent family of Glendale and converted to a music library. Years ago I went to check out music records, now they have film (in the form of videos). However, my recent trips have been just to enjoy the park facilities adjoining the library. Be sure to see the Doctor's House (check as the hours are limited), a house from the Victorian era and the Japanese Tea House. During Jan. or Feb. the city of Glendale usually brings in tons of snow for the kids to play in. Also, there are trails behind the library where you can hike or mountain bike. In addition, there are meeting rooms that you can rent for an event. Bottom line...there is something for everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inajeanb
50,Great art library,"Gorgeous location in the foothills, plenty of parking, fine art classrooms downstairs, and small first class art library upstairs. There is a Japanese garden and a separate historic house with tours, inside the park. Next to the parking lot is the trail head for a beautiful urban hiking trail. This park is being renovated so check to be sure you have access to everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes

30,"Under Construction, come back next year!","Brand park is a lovely place, and great for photos, but it is currently under major renovations! The entire library is closed and covered in construction materials. The tea gardens are still lovely, but do need some garden maintenance, and the doctor house charges for wedding /special event photography. The improvements are set to be completed for fall of 2014, I suggest returning then!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdriC_12
40,Nice place to go on the weekend,"The park is very nice and has interesting places to visit, such as Doctor's House and the library. There a very few tables and they allow barbecuing so the tables go fast. There is a nice children's playground area. There is a baseball diamond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francesm760
50,Great for a family outing.,"For those who are more adventuresome, you can access the mountain trails from the park. Go straight up and over the top to the fire trial, then wind your way down. It's a good 3 to 4 hour expedition!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1eugenec
30,Old Mansion,"This isn't a park in the literal sense, but it does have a beautiful old mansion that now houses a library and art space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoeopa
50,A gem of a small park,"Beautiful grounds, a 19th century home, the library, and hiking trails are all part of this city park. We saw a baseball game being played, a wedding being performed, and just loved this oasis in Glendale, CA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl103

50,I LOVE this park,"As a previous review states - not too many people know about Brand Park since it is in the heart of a residential neighborhood. Glendale is not as well known as it's ""older sister"" Pasadena and is often overlooked. If You have a chance to visit - don't miss it. It is very well maintained and a great place for a picnic, hiking and a day with the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gigi0561

50,"Historic Park with Japanese Garden, Victorian House, Acres of Hiking Trails and more...WONDERFUL!","You can spend a day at Brand Park and have so many things to do. Most people in LA aren't even aware of its location. There is a baseball field, grassy areas, picnic tables and a playground area for the kiddies. There is also a Japanese garden, but the hours are sporadic; and the Victorian house is only open Sunday afternoons for tours. The Brand Library is Leslie Brand's (one of the first founders of Glendale) original home, but has been turned into an art and music reference library. There over 30 acres of land which belong to the city of Glendale, donated from Brand, which have many hiking and biking trails throughout.If you are interested in finding out more about the history of the Brand Family and the library, you can check here: http://www.brandlibrary.org/brand_history.asp",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinascucina
