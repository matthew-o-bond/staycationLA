50,Fun way to spend a day,"The unique thrift and vintage stores are a fun way to spend an afternoon. The restaurants and bars that line the corridor are pretty good as well. Not amazing, but pretty good. The stores are generally overpriced but the Assistance League and the AIDS store are both worth visiting for interesting finds. Art Du Vin is worth a visit as well.",travelingrules
40,LBC ARTS DISTRICT,"Home to a host of varying ethnicities. This is a very quaint and popular, the ""East Village"". This place ROCKS! Great local culture, restaurants, bars, shopping for unique items, and night-life.",fareedzulu
40,FUN TO EXPLORE SHOPS AND FOOD,Hard to say where to begin and where to end on 4th street. You keep coming in and out of little areas of great surprises. The art night walk is fantastic. Lots of shops along the street and a great selection of restaurants. Park around Redondo Rd or closer to downtown and start your walking and adventure,SenorGancho
40,Gentrified lil area that's becoming hipster,Short area that's becoming gentrified and hipstered.Lotsa the cool kids here. They call it retro row.Hip shops and very cool small restaurants.

Great shops for gifts for yourself or others and shop owners that make each visitor feel like a special guest. Check it out but wear your walking shoes.",thizizliz
30,The connection across downtown,"When you're going for a stroll downtown, there's really only one east-west street worth making the connection between Pine and the Promenade and points beyond...that's East 4th. Fun shopping and restaurants. Not as well lit as I'd like at night and a lot of drifters make it feel a bit unsafe after dark.","Double ""Ollie"" Winner"
40,Long Beach's Retro Row (Fourth St.),"Great Shopping and Dining area. If you are looking for vintage clothing, jewelry, accessories, antiques or other retro items, go to Retro Row. There are several shops to explore and find that special item you have been wanting. There are also many different food choices and a Great restored Art Theatre. Wish I could have spent more time there.",Brenda
30,Disappointed,"I think Retro Row has more appeal to young locals than an oldster like me who shudders at the vintage polyester clothes.I was looking for a larger selection of accessories like jewelry and scarves. Most of the stuff wasn't displayed very well. I was hoping to find a few more older designer labels. With the exception of one store employee, no one seemed very friendly or welcoming or cared if you were there or not. One of the stores with furniture was closed on Monday as was the AIDS thrift store. The others didn't have especially choice pieces.I did eat at the Social List which I would recommend.We were staying in the Bluff neighborhood. I enjoyed seeing the well kept Craftsman homes and appreciated the walkability of the neighborhood.",Rhensrude

40,Retro Row,"East 4th st. is known as ""Retro Row"". It's only a few blocks long and has fun stores with different items for sale than what you will find in the mall stores. Thehas an old refurbished movie theater, lots of places to eat and a coffee shop that you really should visit called Portfolio. It's a local spot and trendy folks mingle with visitors and talk about everything from art to politics and music. Fun section of Long Beach to visit.",J S
20,Wasn't Impressed,I'd heard about 4th street all week so perhaps my expectations were high. I went down to 4th street and I was underwhelmed. There weren't as many stores as I was expecting and they weren't that great. I'd probably recommend going some where else.,KendraDawnRN
40,Nice local restaurants and shops,"Park cheap at 4th and Cherry. My fave restaurants in this area: Lola's (creative Mexican), 4th Street Vine (wine bar), Aji Peruvian cuisine, The Pike (fish grill). Great people watching, all types of artsy folk.",David R
10,Save the walk or bus fare,"Retro row is advertised in all the brochures as an eclectic Art district with vintage shops. I found a run down area with some places that reminded me of the salvation army. Skip this area, heat for Belmont shore instead.",kskkgd
30,"If you shower less than once a week, these bars are for you","First, I need to say that I LOVE 4th street during the day. It was hard to give it three stars because I practically lived at Portfolio coffee house in my college years, and all of the quirky vintage shops lining the street are so much fun. It's a great place to go digging for treasure. That said, beware when the sun goes down, lest you find yourself in a bar that resembles a hallway cornered by 21 year olds wearing moccasins and asking you about your top 5 favorite bands. If that's your scene, no harm, no foul, but I outgrew it a long time ago.",Abbiechan
50,Vintage galore,"4th St. (aka Retro Row) gets better every year. Go there for the dive bars, the funky people, the vintage clothing stores and the mid-century moderns furniture retailers. There are a couple of nice places for lunch/dinner like the new Argentinian/Italian pasta place P3 and a modern pho establishment Number Nine. Care for a beer? Go to The Pike, owend by Chris Reece drummer of Social Distortion. Check out Salon Pop for a funky hair cut in a vintage environment or have a classic shave at Razorbacks Barbershop. Do not miss stores like InRetrospect and Xcape and don't forget to catch a movie at the 4th Street Art Theater.",AdrianaSibaja
40,Also Known As Retro Row,"Coffee shops, boutiques, hair salons, and historic structures, oh my! Definitely a hidden charmer in historic Belmont Heights.",cbucka
20,small shops large prices.,small shops large prices. Nothing special. We've been in the antique business for several years and one of the things we enjoy doing on vacations is going to antique stores. These stores had some great pieces but they were more then we'd spend retail in Chicago. If you look hard enough you may find something but not worth the time in my opinion.,csogkal
40,Great vintage shops! Not over priced..,Love this area! It's all vintage and well within the safe zone of Long Beach. Give it a shot. You just might find that little item you can't find anywhere else at a decent price!,Chad H
30,NO Sharrow/ cyclists in harms way,"LIKE the sidewalk extentions""parkettes..VERY cool.LIKE the eclectic mix of shops and cafes.WE ride our bikes often in this area.4th Street is TOO narrow to mix bikes with cars at high traffic hours.The Bike planners must never ride commuter bikes on our streets.IF U ride on our streets..BE careful.",P-and-A-Belmont
