40,High End Outdoor Mall,"Lots of shops and eating venues with many comfortable and shaded places to sit and even entertain kids. Very pleasant to walk around, with lots of parking and many places to visit. Wouldn't go here if looking for a specific something, but if you have time to browse, you might just go home with the unexpected. I did.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,fun sipping & shopping,"we loved exploring this cute little ""town center"" in Malibu. it's a great place to grab an iced coffee and roam around petting pampered pooches. lots of cute shops too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachaelLeigh
30,Nice place for a snack and window shopping--way overpriced but it is Malibu,"This is a nice place to stop for a quick bite at one of the cheaper joints but everything is WAY overpriced here. I am sure it is due to the ""Malibu"" tag attached to everything. But these are not much different than things you can get other places like Santa Monica, Manhattan Beach, etc. We got some pasta and a panini and they were OK. Malibu Mutts looks good and I would recommend giving that a try.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gjfromwa
40,Lovely open air mall,"Stopped here during a drive up the coast, was a nice little mall with plenty of parking. A few places to have a bite to eat and shops to find a bargain. Nice change from the busy feel of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowellyBear
40,Don't Let the Name Fool You,"The Malibu Country Mart is nice to walk around and get fresh air. It's clean and the landscaping is attractive and well manicured.I'm not going to lie. The shops are pricey. They're fun to look around though.There are several upscale restaurants, but there is a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as well.There's a lot of outdoor seating to sit and people watch or eat your acai bowl from SunLife Organics or sandwich from John's Garden. Plus, a toddler (and a little older) play area is in the middle of it all.On a nice, sunny day the parking lot fills up quickly. I prefer to go early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamarahammer

Lovely shaded patio with benches to eat at.The shops were very pricey ($600 for a candle?) and with limited selection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatlandermanitoba
40,High end shops; nice restaurants,"Is worth a stop if in the area. Would be a good place for lunch (we chose Malibu Pier for lunch and while it was good, isn't worth the hassle in my opinion). We bought a few things at the Lululemon, but otherwise found the clothes to be a little ""out there."" Still enjoyed walking around. If looking for swimwear, check out the Rip Curl store just down the road - less expensive while still attractive (and in which you could actually swim).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLS006
50,Shopping and dining in paradise,"Funny how this place has transformed into a high end shopping and dining destination in a small beach town. The shops are the same you get in bigger destinations, but saves the local the drive. The restaurants are good too. We liked the Malibu Habana Cafe. Parking can be a challenge, but be patient. I suggest you head for the back for better chances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseF98
40,Attractive Shopping Center with Plenty of Parking,"Malibu Country Mart is loaded with trendy brands and attractive art galleries. The grounds are beautiful, particularly the inner courtyard with playground and outdoor seating. There are lots of trendy brands to shop and if you hit a sale, some great bargains, as well. Located right off the Pacific Coast Highway, the Mart is worth a stop before hitting the beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBS661
50,What a lovely place to spend an afternoon...,"Yes, I can say that again, what a lovely place to spend an afternoon, and a warm one at that. So many boutique shops to wander in and out of, feeding the tastes and budgets of Malibu residents and visitors alike. There is a few food stops, too. I used to go to the movie theater that is still standing, now part of MCM, but way before the place became what it is currently—I hardly recognized it. The country mart concept is prevalent in several California communities, including Brentwood (near UCLA) and Marin County up north. It gives a person a chance to get fresh air and meander the shops without too much interruption from vehicles circling the parking lot. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as it seemed to be a local gathering place for groups of friends and families. There is a little playground for children, too. The landscaping gives it a lot of character--big improvement from 30 years ago. Being near the beaches of Malibu, the ocean breezes took the edge off the heat. It was a great way to spend time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
40,Lovely place to spend an afternoon,"I had seen this place on a reality TV show and wanted to check it out. It was bigger than I expected and featured cool boutiques as well as various eateries. We browsed around and then picked up Cafe Lattes at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. The center of the mart has outdoor tables and we greatly enjoyed the sunshine and cute hummingbirds flitting around. Great place for lunch, coffee and shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hexy
50,"It’s a shopping center with boutiques, restaurants and gift shops","It’s a shopping center with boutiques, restaurants, and gift shops. Nice for a coffee break. But if you are exploring the Malibu Coast save your time for the Malibu Pier, Leo Carrillo beach, and Sycamore Canyon. If you are a shopper you will enjoy the center. My preference is to make the stop brief and go exploring. It’s a guy thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Great place!,"This is an interesting place. Easily accesible from the highway, with parking available. We stopped for a drink on our way to the beach and really liked the place.

40,Enjoyable to walk around!,"We enjoyed walking here from our hotel (the Malibu Beach Inn). We got a smoothie and chocolate shake at John's Garden, which were great. They had some interesting salads but we had just eaten not too long ago. We found a little toy shop which was great. We'd been looking for some unique souvenirs to bring home for our kids. We inquired if there were any toys unique to the area since a lot of the toys we'd been seeing were available back home. The lovely lady who worked there found us two surfer bath toys which were perfect for our 4 and 2 year olds. We checked out a couple unique clothing stores that had beautiful soft fabrics. They also had some standard stores like Sephora, Lululemon, Ted Baker, Saje, etc. All in all it was an enjoyable stroll. The park was adorable and had me missing our kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessicaF694

40,Stop Here on your way to the Beach,"Right off the PCH & next to Pepperdine is a prime 6-acre spot that a visionary claimed for a special purpose many years ago.I spent a few hours @ the Malibu Country Mart, which features a well-organized conglomeration of 70+ high-end retail stores, restaurants, & services.The exterior is an interesting mix of architectural styles that are accented by landscaping & gardens that define areas & lend privacy.The playground, picnic, & courtyard areas are popular with kids & Moms, who combine shopping errands with playtime.There is limited Commercial Development in Malibu, i.e., this center & the Malibu Lumber Yard next door are pretty much ""it.""It is a trendy destination that includes virtually every type of shop & service, designed to spare the famous locals from commuting to more visible areas that are half-an-hour or more away.& Yes it is a major Celebrity hangout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChanEvan
40,"Great selection, very crowded","I stopped here while waiting for my husband to finish his business meeting, and it was a great stop! Lots of cute, interesting stores and brands.

30,Interesting break when exploring Malibu,Upscale shops with mostly clothes here. Wish there were more gift shops with a variety of items. There were a few plazas grouped together with ample free parking while you explored. Even a movie theater. Got a $11 Wolverine smoothie at SunLife Organics that was huge and delicious. Cool art exhibit for free at shopping area across the street. But shops didn't hold our attention too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaD741
30,Lunch stop along the beach,"Nice little market in Malibu. Some cool local clothing shops, and some nice restaurants. Definitely check out the juice spot and marine layer, very Malibu.

40,Kinda Funny as it's not Country and certainly not a Mart!,Wasn't sure what to expect with this but it was a stop recommended by a friend who used to live in Malibu. Visited over the Memorial Day weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the cute boutique-y shops and restaurants. My husband picked up a couple shirts there. Had an iced coffee and people watched for a bit. Walked across the street to Malibu beach and checked out the fab beach houses and spotted a couple celebs too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WVMom49

40,Window Shopping unless you have $$$$$$$$,"Very nice spot to grab lunch or maybe a gelato (Grom is so good!) and window shop for a bit. Everything in this outdoor shopping mall is beautiful and feels very SoCal. If you're doing a leisurely day in Malibu but not trying to hit the beach then I'd recommend. They have shops like All Saints and Intermix as well as some other boutiquey shops I haven't heard of before. I usually buy clothes in the $50-$150 range ($200 tops!), but honestly most everything at Malibu Country Mart was way over my price range... I mention that to give you a sense of how expensive these shops are. To give a specific example-- there is a shop for dog clothes and accessories. It's set up like a high end women's boutique in that it has just one or two of each item hanging on the rack. A dog bandana is about $40-$50. LOL get out of here with that tiny scrap of material, my dog would ruin something like that within a week, soooo not worth $50!! There were also doggy sweaters hanging up... I mean, it's August and we're on the beach in Malibu. Albeit, very cute looking, I doubt your dog is that cold and requires a $100+ sweater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjs07f
50,So beautiful,The area is breathtaking. You can imagine living here. It's so peaceful. The shops are upscale yet small. The quick serves are very healthy and tasty. We could have spent the whole day exploring the area. I want to come back soon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/665vickic
40,Fiercely Malibu,We pulled into this shopping and eating area on our way to El Matador Beach for lunch. It was very busy (a Saturday) and mobbed with people in yoga gear and driving Porsches etc.We grabbed a very nice falafel wrap and didn't have a beyond irony 'love me/strengthen me/' basically me me me juice.I quite liked this place. My husband felt a little (!) negative about the extreme privilege on display. Horses for courses I guess.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruuthee
50,"Excellent Restaurants, Shops, Picnic Tables, and Play Area for Kids!!","This is a hidden gem in Malibu is located just west of the lagoon on land side of Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). There are lots of interesting shops (many upscale) and restaurants (ranging from reasonably priced hamburgers/hotdogs to pricey) on both sides of Cross Creek Rd. Plenty of free parking. On the westside is a nice playground area and picnic tables. Good place to take little children (clean and safe). It seems many of the shops don't open until 11 am. There is a public Metro bus (#534) that goes between Santa Monica and Malibu, which stops at the Malibu Country Mart. Malibu Lagoon State Beach is across PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladeela

40,Fun stop,"Our hotel suggested this as a fun stop and it was. There are some chain stores that you can find anywhere - Sephora, Starbucks - mixed in with some local favorites. Found parking without looking too long and it's right across the street from the Malibu Lagoons State Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannany2015
40,Beautiful Shopping Center with High End Shops,"Decided to check out Malibu Country Mart to see what type of shopping was there. It is mostly high end shopping. We just browsed most of the merchandise in each shop. Every shop attendant that we met were very friendly. They could probably tell that we were out of our league but they still said ""hello"" and made small talk. If in the area, a nice place to check out what's ""in"" as far as fashion goes. Make sure you check out the Egrets in one of the parking lots by Malibu Kitchen. The Egrets have taken over one of the trees and you can observe nests and small baby Egrets. You should be able to hear them chattering if close by and watch out from above, lots of pooping going on but that's just nature at its best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tnorton19
40,Fun to walk around!,"We decided to stop by while waiting for our reservation at Nobu. It was a good time waster, but must of the stores closed at 6.

We talked to his eccentric owners as they emerged from a ritzy store with barely any inventory on display.Or head over for two tablespoons of the finest authentic gelato for miles. You can walk into stores with both the tiny dogs and the ice cream.Don't be surprised to find that you're parked between a Ferrari on the right and a Tesla on the left. Dodge teens on hover boards on your way to the coffee spot. Look both ways when crossing the plaza lot, lest you'll be blind sided by fat-tired bicycles.Lovely boutiques. Some larger national brand locations. A movie theater. A Starbucks. Some optometry shops. A yoga studio and two yoga tog spots. A crystal shop. Some real estate offices. And the ubiquitous Urban Outfitters and Sephora. There are plenty of spots to spend money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelredcard

50,Great Stop on a Gorgeous Day,"It was a gorgeous October afternoon here, so an outdoor shopping experience was ideal. Not sure why it is dubbed a ""country mart;"" with these posh shops it seems anything but. However, if you like a spot of outdoor shopping for higher-end things, this is a great place to visit. Mostly boutiques, many local, with a sprinkling of eateries (from coffee, tea and juices, to very nice restaurants). Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jendickinson
30,Just a another mall,"Not much for specialty, as same as most malls around Anytown, USA.

Also a small movie theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/268se

40,One stop shop. Great people watching!,"Parking can be a bit of a pain, especially on the weekends. You can grab your Starbucks, shop through local or big named shops, and grab a bite at a fancy restaurant or a little walk up country store and dine on the patio while you people watch. This is the only place I have ever seen a Lambo parked next to a Honda Civic. People watching is awesome. Some parade their dogs around as if they are in a show, and other times they are trying to pry them away from people as they narcissistically bark!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Williamsland
30,It's...fine...,"To be honest, this whole area is much more of a tourist trap now. And parking is a PAIN. But some Malibu gems are still here and TOTALLY worth the hassle. Taverna Tony's Greek? Incredibly good. John's Garden? Outstanding. Yes, it's a lot for a sandwich or salad, but it's PLENTY for two people. And GOOD. Toy Crazy is also really fun. Several things out to play with for the kids (train, etc.), and a lot of things that are very affordable, especially craft oriented things that aren't in every store. I've lived here 20 years and it was a lot more fun area in its heyday but I still have to come down every now and then for John's or Tony's. And Toy Crazy even gift wraps for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma

30,Chillin in the 'Bu.,"I have to be up front and say that I don't fit into the crowd that uses terms like 'in the 'Bu', or 'luxe', I don't manscape, and I don't drive a Veyron. I don't really get into 'chillin' that much either, to be honest.But this was a pretty nice little shopping area. I probably couldn't really afford anything, but it looked nice enough, and we were there early before all the parking was taken up by Academy Award winners driving their McLarens home from Costco. Everyone we did meet seemed pretty relaxed, and the homeless count was low.Scenically it was really nice, so if you have kids I recommend going early before anything much opens and the Range Rover leather smell gets too strong. They have really interesting trees, but be careful you don't get hit by some manscaped hipster admiring himself in the rear vision mirror of his luxe Lambo as he cruises 'round the 'Bu chillin. Umkay? Peace out, dude. It's been real.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elwood_Seattle

We walked around people (and car watching - ever seen a Veyron or a McLaren P1 before ? :) - had lunch in the square. Go for lunch or a coffee and walk 2 minutes to the beach. Duck under the fence and gawk at the Malibu beach homes you only see on TV. (*Beach is public below the tide line despite the official looking sign),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BP254

Great location easy walk to the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aristadrive
40,Relaxing shopping experience.,"We spent several hours here after checking out the Malibu farmer's market next door. I believe it was a Saturday. The country mart is somewhat of a strip mall but in no way feels like one. With the open courtyard and trendy food court to the sweet little play ground and rural country feel, it's a great place for all ages to shop and relax. The farmer's market next door was the best. There were great vendors with assorted crafts and foods and I left wishing I would have bought more! I will definitely return when back in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rengem

Being the only place in Malibu that we could find to do some window shopping we pulled off the road to have a wander and we weren't disappointed. There are some lovely shops here (some even affordable!) but the central eating area was lovely.

Go to the playground in the square if you want to see some celebs hanging out with their kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/99amym
40,Nice place to eat and shop,This is a nice little place to eat and shop. Only complaints are parking issues (many spots say they are for Malibu Country Mart customers but only for an hour... Difficult if you are shopping!) and that shops can be far apart with few bathroom & water areas. Great little (though expensive!) stores and cute places to eat... Great stop in Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackie178
30,Have lunch outside and possibly spot a celebrity,"We happened upon this spot looking for something to eat. If you aren't from a rich area, you will be impressed with the beautiful cars parked there. Lamborghinis are the norm at The Coffee Bean. Sit in Starbucks and you might see a celebrity. We saw two celebrities while having lunch outside by the small park. Neat little area. Bring your platinum card to shop though. Not for the frugal types.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MullerFamily826
30,Nice area to walk around and dine/shop,The first place we stopped upon arriving in California. It was nice to walk around and look at the shoppes and have lunch. Look forward to visiting again very soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MadelineS784
50,Great Shops and Eats in Malibu,"Although there are a few high end chains, the local shops and restaurants are wonderful.There are many owner operated shops like 98%Angel and Room at the Beach. Really great selections. Also love the food selection, from Greek(Taverna Tony's) to sandwiches at John's Garden. A wonderful place to shop",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethl831
10,Pass on this,All shop vendors were really rude. As though we were inconveniencing them while at work. If they weren't ignoring you they were looking up and down at you giving you the once over and being snobby. There really aren't any great shops either. I guess the only reason to go there is that you might get a celeb sighting- if you are into that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubbles0000
