50,Perfect Neighborhood Bar,"Lawndale Brew Pub is the perfect neighborhood bar! It’s got a great location on Prairie, really great bartenders, a pool table, and plenty of TVs. It is also immaculately clean! They serve tons of beers, wine, and several mixed drinks made with soju, which we didn’t try. They have snacks and complimentary pretzels in case you’re hungry, though there’s no kitchen. We heard they’re considering adding sandwiches or paninis, which would be great. We’ll definitely be back again to have a drink and the bar and just hang for awhile!",GoodToGoGirl
