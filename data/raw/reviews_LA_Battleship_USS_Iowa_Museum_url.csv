50,The best museum in LA,"This is a fantastic deal for the money. The sheer amount of history you can tour, at your own pace, coupled with the percentage of the ship you can tour is huge. The ship itself is impressive, has been very well preserved, and I just love history.Parking is easy, the location is fantastic and the tour really makes you appreciate the sacrifice so many men and women made for our country and the world itself. It was an honor to be able to walk her corridors and to see where so many heroes served. I would absolutely do this tour again.I do think it would be cool if the main galley could be turned into a functional dining room. Would love to eat lunch inside the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PnSfromLA
50,Excellent ship with lots of history,Excellent self guided tour of a heavily used ship. We were lucky enough to go on services day so there were lots of extra boats to view as well but even without that it is worth the quite high entry fee. Lots of information and helpful/knowledgeable guides.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
50,You can't do it in one visit,This is an exceptional monument staffed by very dedicated docents. I took the engineering tour and highly recommend it. It takes a long time and I was unable to take the gunnery tour or wander much of the ship. The below deck engineering tour gets you into the boiler and engine rooms. Technically fascinating. Parking is easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgny1fwd
50,Outstanding Museum!!,"Outstanding Museum and tour, we really enjoyed our time on the Iowa. Our two tour guides were excellent and funny. Retired MR1 US Navy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimbo232020
50,Battleship,This ship is full of rich history. Took a self guided tour and learned so much. They are lovingly restoring her to her days of glory. There are men aboard to help you and are friendly and eager to share their stories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marionq530
50,This is a great ship to visit,"If you have been on this type before, then you will have seen it all before. If not then you will have a great visit with lots to see, learn and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulaY1594EG
30,Ok but if you been on one of these before its pretty much blah.,If you have toured these ships before its pretty much the same. I was disappointed that they restricted access to the most interesting parts of the ship(gun turrets) unless you paid a huge premium. That seemed rather cheap to me.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ModernColumbus
50,Battleship bucket list,Love WWII history and the USS Iowa does not disappoint the self-guided is worth it's a while and theres tons of little things to look at and talk about plus informational videos.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dofoe0423
50,Fun day trip,"Fun day trip, I recommend everybody to go to the Battleship USS Iowa Tour and museum-and experience what the history was like back then and what it means to us now .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardhI8912KH
50,A Must Visit,"Great place to visit. We did the self tour only and it was exceptional. You will be going up and down many ship stairways and in several places the walking area is a little uneven so wear your best, most comfortable, walking shoes and enjoy! The volunteers are most helpful and very willing to share information. If you have children with you, there is a ""Find Vicky"" card/game. The children seem to like it a lot. The gift shop is one of the best I have seen. All in all, it is worth your time to stop by and take the tour. Enjoy!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9956RZdeniser
50,A Must Do,"if you happen to be in San Pedro, California (Los Angeles Harbor), and have some time on your hands, don't miss the opportunity to visit the Battleship USS Iowa (BB-61) Museum. The days of these great ships doing battle on the high seas and faraway lands has gone into the history books. But, you can walk the decks and the interiors of this WWII era battlewagon and almost hear the voices of the sailors who rode with her to war. It is one thing to look at pictures of these great ships, but quite another to walk the same teak decks that FDR walked upon; to view the crew quarters and mess areas; and try to get a feel for what it was like to be stationed on such a vessel in harrowing times. All the more impressive is that the ship/museum is staffed by volunteers, many of whom are veterans. Show your support, and take the tour. You will not be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mizzou214
40,Tour with lots of information,We arrived before opening as they don't open until 10 am but it was worth a wait. We were given a discount as we had our cruise cards with us. There was a film crew on board filming but that did not impinge on our tour of the ship. One of the guides chatted to us awhile when we first boarded but when we moved on another guide came over and he actually gave us a guided tour around the whole ship. There is a lot of printed information around the ship and you can pay extra fora guided tour we were just very lucky and of course early so very few people on the ship. This would be a good place for anyone interested in WWII history or battleships. Suitable for all ages who are interested however there are lots of narrow stairways and some are very steep so not suitable for all abilities. Takes an hour or more to complete a full tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/holiday-view23-7-11

50,Amazing tour!,"My friends and I had such an awesome day touring this awesome battleship! We paid extra for the gun tour and HIGHLY recommend it. It is worth every penny! James was our friendly and extremely knowledgeable crew member who guided us through all of the guns and ammunition. We meandered down through 3 decks to see the ammunition bunkers, computer guidance systems from the 40's, some of the ships armor, and then climbed up into the 5"" and 16"" gun turrets for a close up view of history. It is a tight squeeze into the turrets but WOW! James helped us get a good feel for the action that took place inside these turrets. I will be certainly be going on the gun tour again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulw11810
40,Fabulous chunk of US History.,"This landmark restored and maintained by volunteers shows the love and respect Americans have for their servicemen.Snippets of history and films throughout the boat really brought home what the men who served had to do just to get alone on a day to day, let alone in combat!.Well done people!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rayswt
50,Battleship Iowa Visit,"This is the third time I have visited the battleship (twice with my sons, one with my GF). If you like military history there are so many things to see and learn that you could visit the ship 10 times and you will still be learning new things.If your family and friends are not military buffs, the ship still attracts their attention. The size of the ship, the big guns, its organization and layout, how the sailors lived...it is just awesome. For them a 2 to 3 hour visit is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/guillermoe107
20,Little change form a visit 4 years ago,The Hornet in Alameda is better done much more spaces open to all visitors. You should send your people too the Hornet to see how it should be done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erwin1248

50,Amazing to see,on a cruise and docked very close-by so decidied to visit and so glad that we did.There is so much to see and everything is explained very clearly. Be warned though.........there are loads of very steep steps to negotiate. Great museum/shop at the end but was pricey. Would definitely recommend. There is a charge for this attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CXJ11
50,Battleship USS Iowa Museum very impressive!,"On a recent cruise stop in Los Angeles, California, we visited the Battleship Museum USS Iowa. We pre-purchased tickets online, but could have bought them onsite as others did. We also pre-loaded the “Iowa” app. Not necessary, as the self-led tour was easy to follow & there were volunteers on-board (who had served on the USS Iowa) to answer questions, but it enhanced our experience. The displays & videos were top-notch, all professionally done. We visited the gift shop on the way out & used the free wifi (best off-ship, all-trip). The only “nice to add” would be a small cafe where we could buy coffee & snacks. The battleship was a short walk (less than 1/2 mi.) from the cruise-ship. Would definitely visit again & recommend Battleship USS Iowa to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1rover1
50,A Great Piece of History,"The battleship USS Iowa is preserved for all to see in Long Beach (San Pedro). It is docked right next to the cruise terminal there. She was commissioned in 1943 and was very influential in WWII. It is fascinating to see what our brave ""boys"" had to live in while they were fighting for our country almost 80 years ago! The informative docents on board are mostly retired Navy guys who are more than willing to give you the history involved along with a lot of personal anecdotes that they had lived. Wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamp80
40,An Amazing Piece of History!!,"The visit to the Iowa was an experience to cherish, as it's place in US Naval history is very special. The ship is a great reminder of the sacrifices made by US Navy personnel in protecting our freedom and liberty. An amazing tribute to our brave and selfless members of the US military. Thank you all veterans and current members of the US Military!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelpH5160AK
50,USS IOWA..worth the time when in LA,"A great opportunity to review or teach impoortant history to younger Americans. Thank God all 4 Iowa class Battleships are now preserved. Some great docents on board, most retired Navy. plenty of information on her missions in WWII, Korea, and the Cold War. it is an eye opening experience. Remember, she was designed in the late 30's with out CAD/CAM, just guys with sliderules, protractors, pencils and God given brains.Plan at elast 2.5- 3 hours. take the extended tour option, well worth the 10 bucks. you could easily spend 4 hours if you are into history of the US. BTW, Great exhibits from Robert Ballard in the below decks museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486petert

The staff was enormously friendly and helpful; great people. I can't wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flammepanzer
50,Great Tour,"Similar to the USS Missouri at Pearl, but with missiles added. Tour was very interesting with videos and several guides to provide information at many points of interest on the ship.

50,Awesome Battleship Iowa,Friendly people and to visit the Iowa is to visit a key part of our history. The museum is super easy to get to and she’s right at the cruise port.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swsample
50,Self-guided tour of battleship,Self-guided tours for $19.95 for ages 12-61. The ship was amazing and the explanations on the placards and provided by staff are very informative. I thought the best part was that there is so much to see. It was easy to get to with plenty of parking availability.The Flight Simulator (not really part of the Museum) was unimpressive and not worth the extra $6 ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danmO3576KA
50,USS Iowa is a Must See!,"This ""Battleship of Presidents"" is the first of the four Iowa-class battleships. There are five levels to explore, so be prepared to climb a lot of steps (some steep). Fortunately, our visit was on New Year's Day when the crowds were relatively light so we could take our time meandering about each level. The staff was helpful and provided good background information when asked. Good videos are shown throughout the ship as well. We got a good overview of the workings of the ship and the big guns, and how the crew lived. I really enjoyed the lowest level (need to pay extra for this) to see a special exhibit called ""Lost at Sea"" that talked about different ships that had been destroyed on the water (e.g., HMS Hood torpedoed and sunk by the German battleship Bismarck). One can easily spend three to four hours at the USS Iowa; it was an afternoon well spent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/821dianal
50,Brings back memories of my service. Many good dedicated veterans work there as well.,"Was a great tour. Able to see many parts of the ship.Many prior vets assist on the tour.What a hidden gem. A split 2-3 hours of entertainment.Lots of walking, bring water",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asdfasdfasdfasdf4hzx
50,A Grand Tour,"I've waited since the Iowa came to Los Angels to see it because you could not tour a Gun Turret, well now you can and it is fantastic. The entire point of this marvelous Ship is to get these 9 16"" barrels where they can do some good so if you can not see them, to me it's pointless. The have a fantastic Tour with knowledgeable guides, I can not recommend it enough. Just sorry we did not get down to Engineering, what makes the ship Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrwolfe
50,An amazing monument to the Greatest Generation,What a treat to tour below decks on the most fearsome WW2 vessel. Seeing how and were our sailors lived and worked gives a new meaning to the freedom we enjoy today. Can’t wait to take the Gun Turret tour next. This is an especially important tour for young people who have no idea what our nation faced and overcame in WW2.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passenger748152
50,Awe Inspiring,"There is a real sense of history, and an appreciation of what a massive effort went in to building this ship. It's a living honor to all those who served aboard her. The museum is gradually opening more and more of the ship's spaces and every visit brings new surprises and greater appreciation. The tours are well done and worth taking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314billw

50,Awe-inspiring!,"We loved Battleship Iowa! It played such a powerful part of American history, and we were keenly aware of the sailors who had once lived and worked (and fought) on this ship!

It was one of the main highlights of our California vacation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokkr2020
50,Very Moving,We were on a layover in the area before our cruise so did the tour of tje USS Iowa. Its an amazing story with a very moving history of the ship.

30,Nice day trip activity,"We just visited the battleship with our 2 young kids (7 & 5 yo). It was a good 2-3 hours spent touring the ship. There are good facts and information to read and watch (there were a couple of spots where there are movies/interviews). There is the app also, but we didn’t download it. We enjoyed just walking through and observing on our own.The kids had a decent time. There is a little game (treasure hunt) for them to play so that kept them a little more focused on the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009

50,Interesting visit to see this historic battleship,"We bought tickets for the self-guided tour and followed the arrows around the ship. You get to see the sailor and officer quarters, the gun turrets, the communications center, the mess hall, the bridge and even the room where FDR stayed on this ship as it took him across the Atlantic Ocean for his meeting with Stalin and Churchill. A definite must see if you're in the area. Volunteers, who were retired Navy, were around the ship to answer questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/treeface

Got to see where the sailors slept, ate, and defended freedom from the gunnery and munitions area. Some areas had retired sailors retelling stories of life on the ship. We learned a lot about this ship that served in three different eras of US history. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tagnrocky
50,USS Iowa trip.,Very nice place and great for little kids. Fun scavenger hunt for the kids. Cool view and great history too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Padrefan101
50,A great stop on our trip!,We ended our stay in LA with a tour of the USS Iowa. We were leaving LA by cruise ship which was moored right next door. During the morning of our departure we toured the Iowa. It was so handy as the staff very kindly stored our luggage while we did the tour. As well our cruise documents entitled us to a discount on the tour. My husband is a retired history teacher so this was a must see for him. We were able to check out many parts of the ship and there were excellent information panels available as well as retired Navy personnel to give information and context. Well worth the stop!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janethV2301SU
40,Audio Tour Requires an App,"It is really tough to not give the USS Iowa Museum an excellent rating just based on the historical significance of this ship. However, after visiting other military ships and museums I feel this museum offers less access than most. They do offer an extended Iowa experience that gives you access to the third deck. Neither the general admission or extended experience offer access to the cannon chambers. Was disappointed that a standard audio tour is not offered. They do have an audio tour but it requires you to download an app. It took us about 2-3 hours to go through the standard tour with young kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krogersku
50,Great museum in need of support,"The Iowa was the last stop on our LA trip and it was a perfect way to end a great long weekend. Having been on the Missouri when I was in Honolulu, it was good to have a point of comparison between the two.Any visit to one of these ships needs to be preface by stating that these ships are BIG - the size and scale of the Iowa is something that needs to be seen in person to truly appreciate what an undertaking the vessel and ships of its kind are. Another point is that these were designed as complex weapons of war, to be manned by young people in the physical peak of their lives. Accessibility for less hardy guests can be an issue - be sure to call ahead if you're in this category.The Iowa Museum serves history well, both as an active museum chronicling its distinguished service and narrating the periods during which it served. All of the exhibits were informative and the veteran volunteers were overly friendly and full of information.A point or two. The Iowa is privately funded; so elements of the ship are in need of renovation for want of money. Also, the special paid exhibition regarding the Ballard missions wasn't great; after seeing it, I was very surprised that it was it and that they charged extra for it.The Iowa is well worth a few hours when you're in LA. Best of all, it's only 20 minutes away from LAX and has excellent restaurants in proximity so it's a great first stop when you land or an excellent bookend to your sunny California visit. Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKB1701
50,Great Experience,Visting Iowa battleship was a great experience and well worth visit. Very interesting to visit a great battleship that served to protect the world democarcy and free world.

It's a pretty impressive warship where the tour explains how it worked, crew member positions and past presidents that boarded it.It there were any downside to Battleship Iowa it would not be the tour itself, it would be that it is all the way in Longbeach and may be a bit of distance for those centrally located in Los Angeles",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikedX1063NZ

50,Great experience!,"We were lucky enough that someone from the USS Iowa Museum gave us and some other people a free guided tour of the ship, which made it an unforgettable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joachimh660
50,Great!,I recommend this historic ship museum highly. I paid for the small group tour and the docents were knowledgeable and friendly. Do not miss this if you are in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/436jonathanj
50,Well Worth a Visit,"There are not many places in the world where you can get the opportunity to visit a battleship so when I was visiting the area I took the opportunity to include the USS Iowa in my itinerary. The self guided tour around the ship (aided by the very informative app) shows the history of the ship and provides a feel for how it must have been living and working on board. My only disappointment is that there was no access to the inside of the big gun turrets but given the access problems this is totally understandable. Well worth a few hours of anyone's time, particularly if you have an interest in military or naval history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GavinArnold
50,Wanted to pay my respects to the soldiers,Very large naval battleship that sailed in WW II and where soldiers fought for our freedom. Lets remember these soldiers and what they did for us,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic815143
50,Fun historical day,"I took my children and nephew to visit the Iowa. The kids loved walking around and taking pictures. Towards the end, we sat next to a volunteer, who proceeded to talk about his experience on the Iowa. It was very fascinating to learn about a valuable jewel of our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/365LV
50,Very neat,Very cool experience. The guides were super friendly and very informative. We asked time of questions and the were more than happy to spend time with us. I only wish I had of taken more time......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nshvpredator09
50,USS Iowa,"Very interesting, it is a sister ship of the Missouri which I have also seen, but during the eighties several changes were made to both. Both ships participated heavily in World War II and both were hit by the enemy with minimal damage due to their armor, bringing realistic observation of the word Dreadnaught.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k0nar0n
50,Battleship Iowa was an amazing time!,"Visiting LA, I brought my 2 teenagers to take a tour of the Battleship Iowa and we loved it! What an amazing testament to the power of the US Military, and the guides all around the ship were informative, helpful, patient, and just a pleasure to speak with about the ship. It's not easy to entertain a 17 and 19 year old, and it was one of their favorite parts of visiting LA. Cannot recommend enough, 5 stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcmS2997NY
50,Full Steam Ahead Tour,Kathy & Larry did an excellent job and were very patient answering all of my questions -Fascinating tour!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallypowell123

This was one of the best museums we have ever visited !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobndeblopicolo
50,A MILITARY DAY,"We had a lovely day in San Pedro, first visiting the USS Iowa and taking the self-guided tour. So much to see! And there were guides available at many points along the tour to answer questions or provide information. There were also TV screens stationed around the ship showing different events that had taken place, or interesting facts about the ship. I understand there are two other tours that can be taken, but we were with preteen children and didn't want to overdo it. We all had a great time, and learned so much! From there, we went to the Maritime Museum down the street, also a very interesting museum that just doesn't get enough press -- we had never been there and had lived in the area for forty years! From there, in keeping with the seafaring theme, we had a late lunch at Whale and Ale on 6th Street for some great fish and chips. After that, we went to Fort MacArthur, to the bunker/battery museum they have there, filled with old newspaper articles about the war on the walls -- interesting reading, and a lot we didn't know. From there, a hike up to the Korean Friendship Bell, and then home, taking 25th Street so that we could see the beautiful mosaic mural that has recently been installed. This makes for a very nice day trip for out of towners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathiek611
50,Fantastic!,One of the best tours I’ve experienced! We are local & went during Fleet Week. The tour was so informative & interesting. The workers knowledge & stories of the ship is what made it so amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sandctrotter

50,USS Battleship Tour,"My husband and I toured the ship with our three daughters ages 17-22. We did the self guided tour. We all enjoyed it and thought it was a great experience and learned a lot about the ship and the people associated with it. Since we are from Iowa, we got free general admission by showing our IDs. Veterans also receive free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205jodib
50,History Adventure,"Slow down and follow the path through an eye opening tour through what life is like to live in a floating city from the admiral quarters to a seaman’s bunk. Plus the only bathtub on a battleship. Knowledgeable docents explain the many aspects of artillery and fire power a battleship carries. Fun for everyone but wear appropriate footwear, lots of walking & ladders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanneJ1363
50,Fleet Week Visit,"This was my second visit to the Battleship Iowa, and I enjoyed it as much as the first. This visit was during LA Fleet Week (Labor Day Weekend), and there was a lot more to see and do, with the military and police department displays, food, music, etc.I definitely recommend visiting the Iowa, it's a great piece of our History, and I find it fascinating imagining what it was like to live and serve aboard the ship.Marc",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcdD5814CS
50,An amazing piece of history,This ship is an amazing piece of history! I had no idea of everywhere it travelled and everything it had been involved with! I’ve lived near it for 30 years and had never taken the time to explore it until “Fleet Week” this year. It was a wonderful afternoon of walking through it’s many decks and areas and learning a lot of the history of this enormous ship. I’ll have to go back to see more of it as there was so much to see on one trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbkt12
50,Great for families & lots of veteran volunteers.,"The vets will chat with you and you learn from a living part of history! Was very educational & fun.The kids had a little treasure hunt, they enjoyed that too. the last half of the tour has lots of climbing, may not be suitable for people with knee problems",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7393DImarya
50,Great Tour!,We got some outstanding customer service while we were visiting the museum and received the extended tour for free since someone in our group was current active military :) The ship is huge and there was a lot to see. We've been to many of these types of ships and this museum definitely showed you more of the ship than most others. There were also a lot of interesting videos playing throughout the museum and the extended tour includes an area which goes over shipwrecks which was super interesting. Definitely recommend you wear close toed shoes since the stairs throughout the ship are very tight and there are a lot of metal ridges sticking up throughout the ship which you can bump your toes on. It was pretty hot the day we went but inside the ship they had the AC pumping so some areas were warm but others were really nice so dress accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity579509
50,Living Hostory,"The Iowa is a very interesting piece of living history. Besides the incredible historical facts of World War 2 that cemented the Iowa's place in human history as it really served as floating White House for President Roosevelt and his commanders, and the remarkable work it keeping the battleship in great condition. The real heros are the volunteers who are lively and engaging and really make the ship come alive to it's guests as you walk along this incredible ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbydiablo
50,Just awesome!,You are greeted when you board which was very nice. The museum surpassed my expectations and there is so much history. I will definitely be returning when I can spend more time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jpaez2511
50,So good that my teens forgot about eating,"My two boys, 14 and 15, are currently very interested in battleships and naval history. When we drove in and the ship came into sight, they both got so excited and started yelliing, There it is, there it is! We had started our trip the day before in Oregon, and arrived about noon. My plan was to buy tickets for the VIP tour, get them lunch, then send them on the tour while I hung back with the dogs at a park (too hot to leave them in the car).Forget lunch, my 2 teen-aged boys couldn’t wait to get onboard and start exploring right then and there. I managed to stuff some trail mix and protein bars in their pockets, but 4 hours later when they came off the boat, they hadn’t touched the food. They were brimming with stories to tell me. Glad we made the excursion and hope to get back soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oregonducksally

There is so much history to be learned and the volunteers are full of stories to bring it alive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sjlk

50,History Must See,"It’s so amazing to see where our Navy lived while out at sea. The tight quarters, the meals and of course the big guns they used to fight for us. Everyone, man, woman and child who has a chance should see the magnificent beast. I’ve been to the USS Missouri, USS Midway and now the USS Iowa. Great experience especially if you know someone who was in the Navy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debtaylor

40,Naval History,"This is the second time I have been to the USS Iowa Museum and they are always improving it. To be aboard an actual battleship that is in good condition, is something everyone should take advantage of. Self guided tour, very well laid out, informative. Lots of steep ladders.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callan1034
50,A tour of the USS Iowa,"My son and I visited the USS Iowa on August 21. It was a fascinating experience. You're allowed to go through most of the ship - certainly enough to get an excellent idea of what life must have been like for most of the sailors aboard. You can climb five stories up - almost to the very top. Included is a small museum and a first rate gift shop! Also from the deck, you get a great view of San Pedro harbour. I'd just like to add the way we got there. We didn't have the use of a car and since our hotel was near the corner of Hollywood and N. Highlands, it was quite a distance! We decided to take public transit. First we got on the Red Line subway towards Union Station and got off at the Metro Center / 7th St. stop. From there, you hop on a Silver Line 950 bus... Make sure you get on at S. Flower street or you'll be going in the wrong direction. Also take the #950 and NOT the #910. This bus runs every half hour. Cost is $2.50 or TAP card plus 75 cents. I thought it would take well over an hour but only took 40 minutes as part of the trip is on Interstate #110 with exclusive bus lanes and stations.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttawaDave
50,"Fascinating tour, strongly recommend","Really interesting to, fascinating history lesson looking around this incredible ship, all of our kids really enjoyed it to, age 11, 13 & 17. Well worth having a guide they do tours regularly and lots of detailed knowledge",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ejbennet
50,History in every detail,The ship is beautifully renovated and have such interesting stories to tell. To stand by the very table where the D-day was planned makes history come alive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/x3m2
40,Walking through a glimpse of the past in the present.,Great time to walk back into time and see where our Sailors were fighting from and how they quarters looked. I am sure it looked different to them as young men. They served our country well in their work.We are a family of service people covering the four branches and different wars. In the Air Force I had it easy compared to the Sailors on the Iowa. They have my thanks and salute for their service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Culture686634
50,Great Experience!!,Loved going to see the ship. Great staff they were excellent in every aspect. Left with knowledge for what those who served on that ship had to go through. Hope the experience for others will be able to continue. It’s a must see!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noemip529

50,Bugiada Review,"We got to see much of the inner workings of the ship. As an engineer, this stuff really fascinates me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rjbugiada
50,Outstanding,"The full steam ahead Tour is in my opinion a ""must"", if you really want to see the ship. It really and truly shows you the size of this battleship, and the technology, which is decades old, but in an immaculate state. Just amazing. I hope, that the team can extend the tour in a few month including one of the turret's (big stick).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marigothill
50,"Impressive, informative and impactful","Have been to Long Beach many times but never checked out the Iowa. What a treasure! This is one of the few places in the US that brings the legacy of WWII to immediate life. It's breathtaking to walk the deck and among the rooms of one of the ships that won the greatest conflict of the 20th century. It is maintained very well, restored recently, and the history in every room, on every level, is astonishing. You don't have to explain to kids or any other guests what this was about because it's right there, in life. The ship is magnificent in person, immense and powerful, and it makes a non-military person like me much more aware of what a great battleship really is. There's so much here -- for smaller kids, just to walk around and climb into and out of the rooms, which are well-laid out and explained, for teenagers who may be studying WWII or history, and for older people who know about history but never had the chance to see it up close and be part of it. I was moved by the fact that this was the ship that took President Franklin Roosevelt to the Tehran conference for one of the major strategy sessions of the war -- you walk through the rooms he stayed in, and see the only bathtub installed on a warship -- secretly, because FDR was disabled -- and you are really standing in the spot where people who shifted the course of history once stayed. Everything about the ship is great, except the app they encourage you to download. Sadly, it does not work at all. I think it's supposed to be connected by Bluetooth to various parts of the tour, and the information is supposed to pop up when you are standing near the area, but it does not work. It looks like a great app but they need some technical assistance to get it running. But it's not necessary to enjoy the visit. Also, there's an extensive museum at lower decks about other ships and tragedies at sea, which is worth seeing. I think it's an extra price for the museum, but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidzee

50,Do Not Miss This,"This is one of the greatest attractions ever. Do not miss the chance to see the ""Big Stick"". The battleships are the greatest war ships of all times and are no longer around. This is just one of the big BB's that you need to see. The people whom are taking care of this engineering masterpiece are truly amazing and are owed a alot of gratitude for bringing this monument to the area and keeping it alive for generations to see, that may never know what the IOWA did for this country. God Bless the USA!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdg11761

Disappointed in that the Iowa was not reconditioned like the New Jersey as Iowa had so many weapons added from 1945, the Korean War, The Cold Was whereas the New Jersey was totally reconditioned for it's service during the Vietnam conflict and the total inside was refurbished for the crew and officers.

20,"Nice visit, poor customer service","We were so excited for this visit, as my son is getting ready to enter the Navy. The ship was great to explore, however, you have to pay extra to see certain parts, which was disappointing. The employees were friendly and full of information, when you could find one. The most negative part of the visit is the inability to receive the pictures that we paid for. I have reached out to the customer service via email as listed on their website twice as well as called and nobody will get back to me. My family has agreed that we have seen it once and will not need to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Curiosity471139
50,Great place with the kids,"Leave behind the fact that IOWA is a massive machine designed to kill people, and this is a fascinating exhibit.

I also liked all the history about all of the wars and routes the ship has been on. It was a long self-guided tour and was beautifully refurbished. My only complaint is that the gift shop is ridiculously over-priced. I don't buy souvenirs anyway so I usually don't notice it, but $40 for a t-shirt or $10 for a sticker?!?!?!? Kind of crazy. But all-around it was a good stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corbyers111

50,Spend time speaking with the volunteer/retired service members on board!,"The USS Iowa is a great ship to visit. The interior is fairly similar to other ships I've been to, but this one is special because you have retired service members all over the place that will tell you about their experiences and will answer any question you have. That's what made my visit so special! It was amazing hearing so many different stories!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/foundthetravelbug

Walk around their ship and quarters and imagine what is was during the wars it was in action!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WillemvdKraats
20,Not the ship fault,"There is not about the ship it is about the services. They cannot scan your ticket if you bought via booking.com. It is non sense.We often buy the tickets online before go somewhere because first we just a tourist with very limited time. Second... who like the long lines?We hear about the ship at booking.com marketing page, so it is good nice tip. Bought a ticket there for sure. Okay so let’s go there.There are two lines (there was some event because this happen at the Memorial Day). You can imagine the two lines... one for buying tickets and one for the entrance. We have tickets online with barcode dates and everything so wait a bit at the entrance line and they said we need to go back to the tickets line... exchange our booking.com tickets into their official tickets... we needed to wait at another line a hour long and after go again to the second line.We lost more than one hour and the worst... lost our good mood. So just run accross the ship without stop and learn. With go there and back a half day gone. Very important the half day if you have just a few in one big city.So shall buy your ticket directly at there website!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ggecse

50,Amazing Battleship with Incredible History,"My son and I had not planned on visiting the battleship during our vacation to LA, but I’m glad we did. This battleship is amazing based on the construction and weaponry for which it was outfitted. The various types, sizes and quantity of guns are impressive, and it is one of the most powerful battleships that has sailed in the US Navy fleet. The history that occurred on this ship, especially during the planning of WW II is also amazing. The planning of D-day occurred aboard this ship with President FDR and high level military leaders aboard. My teenage son and I purchased the basic tour and watched the videos and read informational signs as we walked the ship, but you could probably learn even more if you use the app. The access to various parts of the ship is also amazing, but please know in advance that there are a lot of steep stairs and stepping through steel walkways to move throughout the boat. If you have mobility limitations, you will not enjoy the full aspect of the battleship. One of my favorite parts of our visit was the announcement of visitors with previous military service when they boarded the vessel. God bless every member of the military that has served to give us freedom! I highly recommend a visit to the USS Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayBurgin72
50,USS Iowa is not to be missed,"I was not in the Navy, but I have always appreciated the services they provide our nation. Iowa is one of four battleships from World War II. Every time I visit I am amazed at the craftsmanship and details that were rapidly designed, engineered and constructed during wartime conditions. When you visit look closely at the welding on the massive turrets. Metal is at least 6” thick and totally done by hand! Each of the massive 16” gun barrels weigh around 250,000 lbs. Per Barrel without any breeches or accessories.I was able to see a sister ship, the Missouri, in dry dock in 1983 or so at the Long Beach naval base and like an iceberg much of its mass is hidden under water.Don’t miss her!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passenger748152
40,Nice visit,It was an interesting experienceThe ship was cleanIt kept my kids interestedit took almost 3 hours well spent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O4455QLjuanm
50,History on Deck,"Visiting the USS IOWA will not disappoint as it is filled with memorabilia and historical displays. If you have never seen a battleship before, just the size alone will amaze you. Plan to spend several hours on board in order to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitebread67
50,battleship Iowa,"oh wow! enjoyed the self tour very much! people working here are very proud to tell the ship s history. I ask so many questions that i even have to make sure no one is behind me. The guides were very welcoming of single question and answered objectively, which i appreciate when it comes to historical facts. The tour filled a couple of hours with so much fun and had my sons, who get bored easily, engaged with a game of "" finding Vicky"" pictures (ship s mascot) I would come again for sure! We left with a great sense of awe and patriotism.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mina476
50,Battleship Iowa,"Having served in the US Navy it was like going back in History and reliving the many memorable experience I had during my service. This is a must see for every American with any interest whatsoever in our country's history. If this is your first visit, plan on spending at least 1/2 a day. There are numerous videos take the time to watch them it is time well spent. Go slowly and take time to read the information provided for the various areas and exhibits. Engage a few of the docents and ask questions. The answers will lead to more questions and you will receive answers containing far more information than you anticipated. I have visited Navy Museum Vessels from coast to coast, border to border and Hawaii. This is one of the best preserved and historical ships available to the public. I do have one complaint, however, as with most of the others, you do not get an opportunity to see the engineering spaces. They all exhibit the crew and officers quarters, mess hall, bridge, communications space, and Combat Information center and topside equipment and armament. Only on a Submarine to you get to see the equipment that is maintained and operated by my group (The enginemen, machinist mates boilermen, electricians and others). Hopefully some day ships like Iowa and Midway will be able to open the Boiler Rooms, Engine Rooms, Maneuvering Spaces, and Machinery spaces so that the public can learn what takes place in these areas and how important they are to the operation of these ships.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidhR498UM
50,Touch of history,"A great experience and example of WW2 engineering, it is impressive what was achieved using only the technology available at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eduard998877
40,Tour of the USS Iowa,"I enjoyed the tour. I served on the USS Missouri and this gave me an opportunity to show basically the same ship to my parents and girlfriend. The main thing I wish was changed is very little of the ship is accessible for the tour. I would like to see the entire ship open up with free access to a representative area of all spaces. I would very much like to see the Engineer, Firerooms, DC Central, and some of the repair lockers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbauers
50,Awesome,"Loved it. History rich, vwry impressive. The whole family loved it. Considering having birthday celebration there",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1196TYdavids
50,Great Piece of History,"This was the first time my family had visited a battleship, and it was definitely worth it! The exhibits were well done, there were lots of tidbits of history scattered throughout, and you could tell that there was a lot of labor and love put into the restoration and preservation of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201liyuanc
50,Good museum,Nice self guided tour through a great battleship. It’s comparable to the Battleship New Jersey tour. Could use some more detail ( which is a quibble since I’m a history teacher) but overall enough facts and cool parts to interest even children! My wife liked the Cold War parts and I liked the Roosevelt details. It’s a good place on the 4th of July!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/estuite
50,Great day on the USS Iowa,"Fun for the kids, plus educational. It was interesting to see the quarters where everyone worked and lived. Also where the president stayed as a contrast! Went on a mid-week day and the crowds were few, we could take our time and enjoy it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carle12811
50,Very cool if you like history,"Visited the battleship for Fathers Day. I like war history so this was great to see, read about, and hear using the mobile app for an audio tour. I only did the basic tour so there was more to be seen if desired",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tb004
50,Great Experience,"As the daughter of one who served on IA, it was fascinating to see where history happened. Took an extensive tour throughout with an excellent and enthusiastic guide, full of information and stories. Unforgettable to experience the size and complexity of this massive ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sunshine18503085609
50,A Very Moving Peek into America's History,"My dad and I visited the USS Iowa Museum after accidentally discovering it online (I'd had no idea it was there). Dad was in the Navy in the Vietnam War. I haven't toured a ship with him since I was a teen, and neither of us had ever been on a battleship, so this was a very special thing for us to do together.The video in the beginning of the tour was so well done, and I appreciate that the museum's supporters took the time to put it together so you really get a sense of the ship right away. I loved how much information there was at each ""stop"" of the solo tour (and every space in between). The artifacts throughout really made you feel like you were peeking into America's history, as though you were somehow connecting with the men (and Vicky the dog!) who'd been on the ship in service of our country. I wiped tears from my eyes MANY times, and felt so moved by the experience.I highly recommend this experience. We read books and watch videos about our history, but so rarely do we get to experience it in such a hands-on way. Although Dad has always shared stories with me about his time in the Navy, touring the USS Iowa sparked memories for him that led him to sharing stories I'd never heard, and maybe I never would have had we not visited. Neither of us will ever forget our visit, and I'm really grateful to all of the people who have made it possible for people like us to visit her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeriouslyKW
50,Must see!,"If you’re traveling to LA, the USS Iowa is a must see! Does take a while to go through, but very interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside27864287796
50,Sweet,"Very nice displays. TV and static history information are 1st rate. The only drawback was the pricey gift shop; bought a 32$ t-shirt, wanted to buy more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kareneK4801QW

40,USS Iowa,"Great attraction if you are interested in battleships & the history. You get to walk around this majestic ship and to learn about its story and see where the soldiers slept, ate etc.The onboard crew was very helpful.Check the online price, it was cheaper than paying on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zsoltikaa
50,Great battleship,It was worth visiting and learned history. Volunteers were wonderful. Thank you for your service. Lisa,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kozuelg
50,USS Iowa a great experience,"Took our 10 year old grandson visiting from Illinois. He had recently done a classroom report on the USS Missouri (sister ship to Iowa), and was thrilled to go aboard Iowa and experience it first hand. The USS Iowa is a great way to make history come alive for visitors of all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless16612712831
30,"I only rate it a 3 because, afterall it IS a real WWII US Navy warship.","But, unlike other ship museums I have visited, the USS Iowa is very very limited to the areas you can see. In fact, about all you can see are the deck areas, officer's country, the bridge, some crew spaces, the chow hall and souvenir shop and a lot of graphic displays. You can't get in the turrets, the engine room or any of the really interesting areas unless you take an expensive special tour on top of the $15 standard tour. I love the ship but wish the owners would do more to improve access and spend the money to hire full-time tour guides and crew instead of depending on an all volunteers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside16843286638
50,Gets better everytime!,This was my third time visiting the Iowa. My Father served on the Missouri in WWII so unless I can get to Pearl Harbor this is the next best thing to seeing where my dad worked all those years ago.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieF199
50,The most unique museum I have ever visited,"USS Iowa is a living museum, because you can meet and chat with the veterans who worked on the ship through many battles and visited many countries. Meeting them and listening to their stories make the experience so personal. Also USS Iowa itself is majestic and awe-inspiring. It is totally worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving40475671655
50,Loved it!,"We visited Battleship IOWA and we all loved it! My kids (ages 4, 6 & 8) loved learning about its history and trying to find ""Vicky"" (the Captain's dog whom travelled with all the sailors) kept them engaged the entire self guided tour.This was something out of the ordinary so I know it will be something my kids will always remember. My 8yr old son every day asks us if we can take him back for another visit!If you're planning to visit the battleship keep in mind that there are many super steep steps to climb when going to upper deck to bottom deck and vice versa. So if you are taking an elderly person, it might be tough for them.Buy your tickets online to save a few bucks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vianettm2016
50,History of greatest generation afloat,Was a privilege to tour a wonderful piece of Naval history. I would highly recommend you go early in the day as it will be a better tour not rushing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786vincents
50,USS Iowa Battleship Tour,"My 14 year old son and myself thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Three things I particularly enjoyed; first was when they would announce a past crewmen was coming aboard. Second was how they would allow the crew members sign or personalize their post or bunk on the ship. And third was how they left some locations, mainly the gun turret on the port side, dirty and greasy. When we climbed the ladder and stuck our heads in the access hole the scene and smells were so “real” it really let our senses and imagination run wild just thinking what these young men endured during battle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/468robs
50,Iowa Eye Opener,There is a lot of history. The refurbishing is spectacular. the docents meander around answering questions and the place is well kept. It brought back memories of my childhood in the 50's walking around the several levels.Be sure to visit the level where Roosevelt stayed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,What a great place to visit,Best part was meeting a 92yr old volunteer that was the helmsman during WWII. What a great honor. Very well maintained with excellent videos that provide wonderful information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal244521
50,Reliving history,"Amazing ship - the volunteers keep it looking sharp and are always adding new exhibits. Only 3 other ships ever made like it - the biggest battleships the US Navy ever had. The crew are very helpful and knowledgeable - special lost at sea tour worth it - Also ""Full Steam Ahead"" tour on weekends excellent (need reservations for it).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/martyg21
50,Can't go wrong with USS Midway Museum,Worth every penny. Easily spend the entire day at the USS Midway. I've been here couple times already but I never get tired of it. It's magnificent and beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramondc479
50,Massive piece of history,Excellent guide escorted us through the ship. Amazing equipment for the time to guide the big guns. Fascinating to see how many men crammed into such tight quarters for an extended period of time. You won't be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pvbadger
40,It’s the Bomb,Went here with another couple. Took the extra long tour and we found this tour to be very informative and showed the history of this ship. I would recommend everyone to do this tour. We met Lloyd who was a WW2 vet and even at 95 he looked great. Thank you for the chance to see history up close.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gottcoke
50,A must see,All of us really enjoyed touring the battleship. The path is well marked so you don’t miss anything. It is a good representation of how the sailors lived at that time period and has a lot of history.A todos nos encantó explorar este barco. El camino está bien demarcado así que no te pierdes nada. Es una buena representación de cómo vivían los marineros en esa época. Realmente recomiendo visitar este navío. Tiene mucha historia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaD3832
50,Our first visit and was great,"We've never toured one as a family before. Our kids are 15, 9, and almost 5. Each kid thoroughly enjoyed it. The volunteers that are on site were so knowledgeable and love to relate their information to each member of the family. This is a great piece of history to see and it was the highlight of our Long Beach area visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/musicjoshmusic
50,Well-presented ship,It’s an interesting and important ship and bigger than most warships that you can tour. The $20 basic entry gives you access to a long marked route through most of the superstructure. The videos along the way are more useful than you usually see and the exhibits are ok. Unfortunately you see nothing below deck and you can’t go inside any of the famous gun turrets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
50,Not To Be Missed!,"This treasure came to San Pedro just a few years ago, and they have done a wonderful job of setting the ship up for fascinating tours. The docents are knowledgeable and the gift shop is even fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless730216
50,BATTLESHIP HISTORY,We took a tour on the battleship and it was very nicely restored and maintained. The gentlemen around the ship shared a lot of history about the ship and some of the stories shared with them by people who had been stationed on the ship. Lots of stairs/ladders as well as high thresholds to step over. LOOK at the combo ticket with the Queen Mary for a great discount when you see both!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jknechtly
30,Mostly for WWII Buffs,"If you like naval history, this is a must see. The walk through the ship will take you about 2 hours and brings you back to WWII and the cold war. There are a few helpful volunteer guides, some audiovisual presentations, a neat app you can download and written descriptions here and there. Some climbing up and down narrow steep stairs is involved. It is interesting to see this ship dwarfed by the cruise ships moored adjacent. How times have changed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winnipeg1991
40,"If you have never been on a battleship, now you can","If you have never been on a battleship, and have always wanted to, here is your chance. As a floating nonprofit, you can visit the ship, have school groups come for learning experiences, and check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander_Designs
50,Lots of Navy Stairs UP and Down,"Buy tickets in advance it is cheaper via the internet. Plan on 2+ hours minimum to see.turn into the world cruise center for parking - yu have to pay for parking.Up and down the stairs there is a gift shop and bathrooms are on the way out just before you leave if necessary.To bad the ship is not in its WWII configuration, was reconfigured for the Cold War in the 80's.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perkadventures
40,"Good to visit, but wanted to see more","Interesting to visit as someone who has spent time a sea. It would have been good to have more access to the lower decks and engine room. VIP tours would have given me that, but I think the standard tour should show more of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAKL
50,Great Historic Tour,This is an amazing site to see - I highly recommend it. It's an important piece of US and world History floating in the harbor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Saffi125
50,"Interesting place, but not while you're pregnant!","I came here years ago, while I was still pregnant. All I can say is that it's a pretty neat place to visit to see inside of the ship and learn about it and all, but the steps and stair/rails to go up and down is not pregnant woman friendly (duh, I knew that but I thought I can handle it lol), so if you're crazy enough to visit here pregnant, you've been warned!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satokae
50,Great visit,We had a great time touring around the ship. It was very interesting and educational. There are people who take small groups on a little tour and who are very informative,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsJC2013
40,Great half-day visit,Interesting visit to the battleship IOWA. Great staff that was friendly and very informative. Well worth a visit for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanna_ksd
40,Cool Battleship with a lot of history,This was a nice experience to be on an actual Battle Ship. We were able to see a lot of history and how they lived while at sea. There are multiple levels you will go to and the view from the is beautiful. If your timing is right you may see a cruise ship passing by. I will say this is not made for someone who is handicap as this is an actual ship and the environment is such. There are narrow stairs to climb and descend. This is definitely worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lusion1

50,History,"We were able to walk here from our hotel. If you are a veteran, they write your name in their book and announce you as you board. So much history!! You get to see alot more than you would expect. My husband surprised them by requesting permission to come aboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260juanitac
50,So glad I went,"As I was staying in LA for a few days as part of a 3 week/5 State visit to the US I decided that a must-see thing to do was visit the Iowa as I had driven past it on a previous visit to Long Beach. I am so glad I did as it is a truly wonderful ship. It was quiet there on the day I visited so I wandered slowly around, following the clearly marked route and took loads of photos. The atmosphere is amazing, even though the ship is old it still looks so powerful and full of memories. I really enjoyed looking at everything and the Gift shop at the end was great and very reasonably priced. One thing to be aware of though are the stairs you have to navigate ... they are REALLY steep. A great old ship with a truly amazing history and this was definately a highlight of my holiday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mandy1402
50,awesome battle wagon,My wife and a friend went with me to tour the USS Iowa. My father in law served on the Iowa during WWII and he told me about his duty during that time so it was a great honor to be able to take my wife onboard to honor her fathers service and the service of some many others. I was really impressed with the overall size and capability of this great ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7847peterson

50,Majestic IOWA - still exciting,"From the gangplank to the bow to the stern, this is an exciting opportunity to experience the largest and greatest battleship ever built by the United States Navy. For those of us who served, it conjures deep memories; for the families of servicemen and women and the general public, a visit to the USS Battleship IOWA opens our eyes to the wondrous enormity of our capabilities. You will remember the IOWA for the rest of your lives - and be thankful we had her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChaplainDOV
50,An Important Part of Naval History,A friend and I had a wonderful weekday visit to the IOWA. We are both veterans. The IOWA announces the service of veterans and I think it is a wonderful touch.We both had a grand time exploring the ship on the self-guided tour. The displays were well laid out. There were photo opportunities galore.Everyone was friendly and helpful.I enjoyed my visit and I recommend that everyone take the time to visit this important ship. You will learn about American Naval History and appreciate the sacrifices made on our behalf.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeithS2222
50,Bucket List Item Checked,"I assembled and painted a Revell model of the Iowa when I was 10 and always thought how cool it would be to walk on her decks. To see how her crew worked and lived was fascinating as I imagined how it would have been to sail on her myself. Sleeping on deck because it was too hot below deck. The old girl looked great without any rust and yes, that smell that retired ships have. And it was funny to look through the porthole and see someone had the game Battleship. Well done!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vacation31502148666
50,"VIP tour, dinner","WOW--this ship is incredible! I have been aboard the USS Missouri (BB63) in Pearl Harbor, and it is very similar to the USS IOWA. But the IOWA has a history which includes great leaders like Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, and Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill (I had dinner in the same dining cabin as FDR and Sir Winston, and it was an AWESOME honor. The IOWA represents an integral part of the history of our great nation, and as part of that history we should do everything to preserve her legacy.

50,USS IOWA,One of the Great Historical spots to see if you have a couple hours in LA. You get full access to almost every inch of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paradise-Joe1
50,Very informative,"We've toured other ships (aircraft carriers, submarines, liberty ships) but never got the detailed information the Iowa guides offered. Highly recommend the Full Steam Ahead enhanced tour. The general tour has a lot of great information and you can see all the turrets, but the guided tour goes way more in depth. If you're even slightly interested in military, political, patriotical, or war history, definitely come see the Iowa. It will make you proud to be American, though the reality of what a battleship does is an emotional experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarAway00149982759
40,What's the sense of visiting a battleship if you can't see how the big guns work?,"Well worth going on the guided tour. This is an amazing piece of equipment. Miles of wiring and piping. It just goes on forever. The amount of armored plating is jaw dropping. Though our guide was friendly and well informed, he spent way too much time explaining certain areas. (did we really need to spend time in a basically empty hospital and dentists office?) I felt we should have explored more areas deeper in the ship. The biggest disappointment was not getting into the big gun turrets due to some laden chemical issues. I mean... come on. How many years has this thing been sitting here and they couldn't clean up a few floors in the turrets? This has got to be the most impressive part of the ship... that you can't experience. They did say it is on the agenda for the future. When it is... We'll be back. A massively impressive ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scenic17621872775
50,GREAT HISTORICAL TOUR,We had a interesting and informative tour of this historic ship. My whole family enjoyed the tour. There are so many historical events that took place on this one-of-a-kind ship.

Spent 3 1/2 hours and spoke with all the veterans on the ship. Enjoyed every minute on board and now have a bucket list for the next few birthdays. Oh, February in New Jersey. Thanks to all that made this museum a great place to visit.. America truly is the greatest country in the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckurth0409
40,Awesome Lethal Weapon,"Upon your first sight of the USS Iowa you can appreciate the size and girth of this supreme fighting machine. But its when you start your tour that you realize its shear power and ability to instill shock and awe on your enemies. The 16"" guns can throw a 2700 pound armor piercing projectile 25 miles with great accuracy, the Harpoon Missiles can destroy enemy ships and the cruise missiles can do anything they want. Just an awesome lethal weapon.As you continue your tour and speak with some of the excellent docents you understand that you are in a part of history, an antique from another time. The huge number of people needed to run and fight this ship is unbelievable and lacking the conveniences of todays navy. The outcome is more appreciation for the men and women who serve and sacrifice for our great country. See the USS Iowa and be happy were not and are not on the receiving end of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bruceg108
50,Amazing machinery,"I’ve been on a lot of historic museum warships and the USS Iowa is one of the best. We took a guided tour of the engineering spaces, led by two former Iowa sailors. Having served in one of the boiler rooms and engine rooms, these guys really knew their stuff. Absolutely fascinating as these guys explained how these enormous machines worked. It cost a few extra dollars, but the experience was worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LtColLedbetter

40,Visit the battleship USS IOWA,"We had a great visit. The Full Steam Ahead Tour was fantastic and gave access to engineering spaces not open to the regular tour.

50,Best Navy Ship Tour,"Did the self-guided (with docents on stations) above (main) deck tour last year, and it was very well organied.

50,"Spectacular Battleship, Incredible tour!","We had a lovely time touring this battleship! My 7 year old love the self guide tour and seeing all the different levels, the command center, the brig and the sleeping quarters. It gave him a good idea what it was like living and working on a ship. I found out later that afternoon, that my father had done a ""summer cruise"" on the USS Iowa BB-61 in 1947 as a midshipman at the U.S Naval Academy. We will definitely be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Explore14903722652
50,Awesome and Unique,"The Battleship USS Iowa is one of my favorite Los Angeles attractions! As a native Angeleno, I always love coming down to the Port of LA and touring this historic vessel.

50,Unfogettable place!,We enjoyed the visit very much! The men working there were a bottomless source of knowledge and first-hand information!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sylwiatomekhobosapie
50,Great Experience,"The ship is in awesome condition and it's something you should experience if you find yourself in the LA Harbor area. These ships are like no other museums and being able to walk the decks and make your way around is an awesome experience. One thing to be aware of though is they do guided tours of certain areas of the ship that aren't available on the self guided tours (i.e. mechanical and engine rooms, targeting/fire control rooms, etc) which was a bit disappointing since my father and I came from such a long way and those are our favorite areas to see. Just do a little research to make sure you can see what you want and sign up for the tours if need be. Either way this is a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenaP1828EZ

We had the added pleasure and honor to be in a group of visitors that included two veteran seamen who had served aboard battleships, and listening to them engage in shop talk with the guides was even more enlightening than we could have ever expected. I will contribute to the continued restoration of the Ohio, and hope that they can soon repair the decks and make at least one of the big gun turrets available for tours from top to bottom. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Companion13994690928

50,“The Big Stick”,"The Battleship IOWA Museum is at the Los Angeles World Cruise Port Terminal on the Los Angeles Waterfront.The Iowa-class battleships were designed to pack a strong naval punch without compromising on speed in deep waters. With new generation aircraft carriers being introduced, the US Navy needed faster battleships that could also provide the required firepower to protect these aircraft carriers. This is where the Iowa-class battleships came in.The USS IOWA was the lead ship in her class which included a total of 4 ships built in the Iowa-class – USS IOWA (BB61), USS New Jersey (BB62), USS Missouri (BB63) and USS Wisconsin (BB64).Commissioned in 1943, the USS IOWA is a World War II battleship, distinguished recipient of eleven Battle Stars during her active service.The IOWA’s motto: Our Liberties We Prize, Our Rights We Will Maintain. During her service, the IOWA gained the nickname “The Big Stick”, a reference to President Teddy Roosevelt’s advice “Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.”During World War II, IOWA’s complement was close to 2800 - 151 officers and 2637 enlisted men. The heavily armoured IOWA had guns, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft cannons, to provide formidable armament power.With a length of 887 feet, standard displacement of 45,000 tonnes and a range of 14,900 miles, the USS IOWA had a top speed of 33 knots (38 mph). Propulsion power came from geared steam turbines that delivered 212,000 horsepower to four shafts.In 1982, the Iowa-class ships went through intensive modernization that saw them being equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and Phalanx Close-In Weapon Systems. The IOWA could now strike farther and with more precision, even as she could defend herself better from incoming missiles and low-flying strike aircraft.IOWA served in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. In the Pacific, she received Battle Stars for shore bombardments against Japanese forces, taking part in the Marshall Islands campaign, the Philippines, the Okinawa landings and the assault on targets in Honshu and Hokkaido.She also served during the Korean War 1950-1953 and in the 1987-1988 US Navy operations in the Persian Gulf to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks.One of her other claims to fame is carrying President Franklin Roosevelt across the Atlantic to Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria enroute to the 1943 Tehran Conference between him, Churchill and Stalin.IOWA was also the site of a major tragedy – an explosion of the main turret during a 1989 gunnery drill cost the lives of 47 crewmen. The damaged turret also hastened her final decommission in 1990.Commissioned and decommissioned thrice during her service, she was finally decommissioned in 1990. In 2012, she was towed from Richmond to the Pacific Battleship Center at the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California to start her new life as a maritime museum.We did the self-guided tour which is very well laid out through a single directed path around all open areas of the ship. The IOWA museum also has its own self-guided museum app. While you don’t need to download the IOWA-app to take the tour, it does add a lot if you do – therefore strongly recommended.Some fascinating panels in the museum feature IOWA’s Dog Mascot First Class Victory “Vicky” who had gone AWOL (absent without leave) on three occasions but always made sure to return before the IOWA left port!As landlubbers, we discovered that on a battleship, corridor space and door width are kept to the essential functional minimum. For the same reason there are no stairs, only steeply angled metal ladders. There is a good deal of climbing to be done both up and down these ladders – so you need to have good knees and be careful too, not to take a headlong plunge to an unforgiving metal floor!In conflict conditions at sea, doors need to be watertight or even completely sealable to ensure structural integrity. Therefore, one frequently encounters the appropriately named “knee knockers” through the ship at passageways and doorways. Knee knockers are the 6-8” high thresholds that allow for doors to be tightly sealed. If you forget they are there, or don’t notice them, you’ll trip and land on your knees – hence knee knockers!Please do visit the IOWA shop which has an excellent range of merchandise, collectibles and IOWA related memorabilia on offer. These include plaques, artwork, books, paperweights, keychains, mugs, magnets, can openers, lighters, insignia pins, decals, ball caps, shirts, jackets and sweats, T-shirts, the list goes on.The IOWA museum rules emphasize that children must be supervised at all times while on board. With typical navy humour, it is pointed out that (a) if a child runs into something or runs around and falls on the deck, the IOWA will not be damaged as it was built to withstand enemy gunfire, and (b) ‘Everything on the IOWA was made stronger than any part of your child’s body!’Note: Since the time we visited, understand two more special exhibits have been added – “Lost at Sea: The Explorations of Robert Ballard” and “USS Indianapolis and other Tales from the Sea” curated by LA-based artist Ben Jackel.Extended IOWA Experience tour tickets are available online at $27.95 for those between 12-61 years. Seniors (62+) pay $24.95. Battleship IOWA is open daily from 10am-5pm except on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. Last admission ticket is sold at 4pm.Ample parking is available directly adjacent to the museum – the first hour is free and each additional hour is $2.Battleship IOWA is an incredible experience unlike any other – especially if like me, you’ve never been on a battleship. Walking through IOWA, viewing its many exhibits, one can sense triumph and tragedy, valour and loss, honour and sacrifice, heroism and camaraderie – human nature at its finest in the service of the motherland.A panel on the USS IOWA puts it best: “They came to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends, and left the Navy as brothers in eternity.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,"I had my doubts about a battleship, but it was a very educational tour","Choose from assorted audio tours available on your smart phone (our favorite was about Vicky, Mascot First Class), speak to volunteers stationed throughout the ship, pay a little extra for some add-ons including Robert Ballard's deep sea finds. The steps are very steep, I realized you would not do well on a battleship if you fear heights or are claustrophobic. Enlisted me, stuffed into triple tier bunks in the bottom of the ship deserve commendations just for surviving. The tour was an eye opener for this land loving non-veteran. They do announce all veterans who come on board, a nice touch for those who served.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/531paulinek
50,Informative tour,Stopped by the Battleship USS Iowa as it was across the street from our hotel and we had 1.5 hours to kill before our cruise.

50,The best ever tour (Big Stick Tour),"This is not the cheapest tour you will ever take, but it will be one of the best.The personal service you get from the dedicated 'crew' members is excellent and, in my opinion, they provided more than what they needed to provide. (they exceeded our expectations and they just kept on delivering memorable experiences)Our time on the ship just flew by and before we realised, it was late afternoon and we have been on that ship for more hours than what the tour was supposed to be.The hospitality extended to personal service to get us transport back to the Queen Mary Hotel and is another example of the care these people took to ensure the visit was special.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeilGrigg
50,GREAT HISTORY WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS,"We took the general, self guided tour and learned a lot. The volunteers are everywhere and anxious to answer questions and share their knowledge. The ship is huge and you permitted to walk in many places....officer quarters, captains port cabin, officers mess, crew quarters, crew mess, etc. It took us about 1:45 minutes without any stops in the gift store!I wear a portable oxygen concentrator and needed it for climbing up and down some of the very step stairways. Took our time and did fine, not sure how anybody with mobility problems could do this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennisw354

50,Kids and grownups will love it,"Even though our grandson is only five years old you could see in his eyes that he was dazzled by the size of this ship. It also gave me a chance to teach him about our military lives and what they do for us. Around every corner there is something exciting to see for children and adults combined.Also they have a fun game where you have to find the captains dog, Vicky, which made it even more fun for the little one.And it’s not just for kids I also had a great time look at this great battleship and all the inner workings.Definitely recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tlopez220
50,an amazing ship,My wife and I had the opportunity to look around the USS Iowa before going on our cruise holiday. It was great. The ship is in excellent condition and film crews still use it for filming today. The history of the ship is displayed all around and you have access to pretty much all of the ship. We were there on and a half hours although I could have done more. The gift shop is brilliant with lots of quality items for sale instead of usual poor selection on offer in gift shops. I picked up a hat $29 and a recovered piece of the teak deck that had been replaced $10. There were mugs key rings T shirts on offer too and lots of sew on badges. I loved the visit and would go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/simonjpayne2017

50,You won't believe how far this Battleship Iowa sailed while it was in service.,"We visited this place on 12/30/2018.Inside the ship, we saw the sailing map of this Battleship Iowa. It is just amazing how far and how many neutical miles (acclumulated) it sailed and for so long. Navigating through the ship for about 2 hours is like reading the history book with real objects, and seeing is believing. Great place to learn about our servicemen and servicewomen's history.Also, it is fun to see the food menu that they actually ate on this ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hiro_shiratori

Truly a unique and honored experience. Go see this people, it a treat and we’ll worth your time! And thank you to all our service members everywhere. I so respect and appreciate you everyday. If the Queen Mary is on your agenda, go see the USS Iowa instead, you won’t ever forget it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cruiser00750711670

This is at least 2 hours and I could have spent a whole hour just on the shipwreck exhibit below decks. You need to be able to climb up and down ladders multiple times. Roosevelt took this ship to the Tehran conference to meet Churchill and Stalin! Amazing. The staff was helpful and courteous and the veteran guides were very knowledgeable and friendly. Little kids might get bored but they can always look at the huge cargo ships getting loaded or being tugged out - so even if they don't like history they have something to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilwaukeeMom35

40,Interesting and educational,My visit got off to a rocky start as I had purchased tickets online and rented a car to see the Iowa as I had a day off from a visit to Disneyland. When I arrived I found the Iowa was closed to visitors due to a private function booking the ship although this was not reflected in the online ticket booking service. There were no tour guides however the gentleman working the gate gave my wife and I a personal tour. We had a great tour and based on the gate person’s efforts really saved the day and resulted in a cool experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4386WOchrisr

50,Reverential tour,Provides a down to earth appreciation of what our navy veterans had to deal with.The boat is so rich in history including the room where FDR resided in his trip to Europe during the war. Useful and helpful information is on display everywhere which makes the tour much more interesting. Another nice feature of this exhibit is that whenever a veterans boards the ship as a tourist the PA system acknowledges that persons presence on board. A beautiful touch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N0rlin
50,The “Big Stick” Experience ( A VIP tour that is exceptional ! ),"We took this tour and had no idea just how wonderful it would be. Words do fail to describe what you see and how you will feel. The present ""crew"" of the ship went out of their way to ensure we became part of their family for that day. Lunchtime with ex-serving crew member of that ship (and other members of the present crew) was something to treasure and personal conversions will not be easily forgotten.We still cannot believe how fortunate we are to have had this degree of attention from so many members of the crew. Leaving the ship was a hard thing to do, but all brilliant tours must end.Mike (and Craig) did outstanding work to make the day just ""sing"". Best every tour of an ""object"" and most importantly best fun for a day, made possible by a very dedicate team of people.Value for the money - absolutely ! (we got so more than our moneys worth).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/899trishg
50,"Awesome visit, spend a full morning",Save a full morning to see every nook and cranny of this awesome WWII ship. Be prepared for a long ride from downtown since the ship is far away from most hotels.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cedesilva-brazil
50,I love history,"I love this place nice ocean view, and you get to see how the ship operated during ww2. Great place for pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jayce47
50,Nice day trip,"My wife and I like visiting Military Museums and seeing this ship was great. There were some young teenagers asking their grandfathers and fathers questions about their experiences being in the service, it was nice seeing that inter action. Also some of the veterans whose memorabilia was at the museum were there too and they answered questions. There are films playing that you can watch also. There is no food sold on board so I would suggest going to a place called “Grinders” on the next street and eating lunch and then you could walk off your lunch while touring the ship",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F4491MBjosephm
50,Fun for naval nerds and kids alike!,"My husband and I are nerdy about touring naval ships, so we were very impressed by the extensiveness of the restorations on the USS Iowa. So much of the ship was open for viewing, and there was even a naval museum within. What also impressed me was the ""Find Liberty"" activity they had for the kids. When the ship was in service, there was a dog aboard named Liberty. Now they have an activity where there are pictures of Liberty all around the ship and the kids have to find them all. We saw kids from 3 to 18 enjoying this treasure hunt. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tracykL6774SZ
50,Nice self guided Tour,"We had finished a whale watching tour with our Go Card and thought this would be a great place to visit. If you have a Go Card it's also included. I have also been on the USS Missouri, if you never plan on going to Pearl Harbor this ship is very similar. I like the Iowa because at Pearl you have hundreds of visitors at one time. The Iowa you can explore without being rushed and its quiet. Plan on walking as you will have to climb metal ladders to get between decks. Great if your kids are old enough. Plan to spend time on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeep146
40,Great historical journey,"Great experience for everyone who is interested in history and navigation. The ship is in a very good condition, different kind of exhibitions, especially weapons are really interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255martin_
50,Historic Battleship that shouldn't be forgotten,Went to the USS Iowa with a friend. It was extremely interesting and the amount of space on the ship you get to tour is quite a bit. It took us several hours to walk the various levels and rooms of the ship. They also had a retired naval officer on board who discussed some of the various battles and adventures that occurred on the ship. Highly recommend visiting the ship if you have a half day to spend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seecjplay
50,Great outing away from theme parks!,Such a great tour. Such a great opportunity to come aboard a real war ship. Operated largely by volunteers. The knowledge of the volunteers kept family engaged with answering questions. Kids aged 9 & 11 loved it. Not at all busy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChillyCanuck_1
50,Great Historical Insights,"This is a wonderful historical ship. I loved the tour, but you do have to be in good shape, if you are older, there is lots and lots of climbing going up and down and it is not for people who have mobility issues. I love history, so enjoyed the tour very much, I had a docent tour, request one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parislvr

50,Sailing Back Into History on the Iowa,"My husband has been wanting to visit the Battleship Iowa for a long time. So for his birthday I surprised him with a visit. We went on a weekday morning arriving just after it opened. There were no lines and it wasn't crowded. I was able to find a discount coupon for $4 off the ticket price online and it was accepted at the ticket booth. The self-guided tour was fabulous and we were able to see most of ship, including the sleeping quarters (my husband even crawled into one of the enlisted men's bunk), the laundry room, etc. However, we couldn't go into the turrets due to contamination. The special exhibit ""Lost at Sea"" was quite interesting. Note: you are actually go up and down the ship ladders so it's important to wear closed toe shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CosmosMomLA
40,Historical feeling and friendly staff,"Nice open air museum. One is allowed to walk around quite freely and many areas are open for visitors.Unfortunately we were not allowed inside turrets or decks below. Staff was very friendly and talked about any and everything and they really had a fantastic knowledge about the ship! We visited around midday on a Friday and the place was almost empty, no lines or swarms of other tourists!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neerdy
50,Awesome piece of Americana.,Cool relic of a bygone era. Well maintained battleship and museum. Parking can be tough if cruise ships are docked.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
50,Full Steam Ahead,"Took the ""Full Steam Ahead"" Tour ($50, available on weekends) with friends. Fantastic look behind- the-scenes at the fire control rooms, engine/boiler rooms, Combat Engagement Center, and other areas off-limits to the general tour. Led by a retired naval officer and a former engine room crewman aboard the Iowa providing fascinating information of the inner workings of the ship. If you can be there on a weekend, by all means sign up for this tour. The separate general self-tour is included in the price of the ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brave81
50,Great to walk the decks and internals of the mighty USS Iowa,It was great to do the self guided tour of the USS Iowa. The ship is enormous and it is a fascinating experience to walk the decks and internals of a battleship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barnycanbill
50,Amazing piece of history,"USS Iowa was a really fascinating self-paced tour that takes you around the main areas of the ship. At different parts of the ship you get ""information stations"" that tells the story of the half-a-century or so of active service. A must visit if you are interested in military history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cassilis666
50,This Is An Exciting Landmark,"I love old planes, trains and ships. The Iowa is well maintained and well staffed. It gives you a great idea how out sailors coped with living at sea and being under threat during WW II. It's great weekend stop on your way to San Diego or just to pass the day. Self tours available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/598ede
40,This tour was filled with interesting historical tidbits,"Was fascinated by this tour, having never toured an actual naval ship before. Our guide was well experienced and was able to answer all of our questions. Would definitely do this again in the future",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainep868
30,Nice ship ...little information!,"We spent a good 2 hours exploring the ship, there are many levels which you have to us a narrow slope stairs "" which is not recommended for elderly""I liked president Roosevelt room, it was the highlight of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173hanyg
50,Inspiring Tour,"Visiting Iowa is a most impressive experience. Unless you just rush through, the tour takes a good two plus hours. The restoration has been terrific largely because the US Navy had recommissioned the ship for service in the 1980's and the material condition of the ship had not deteriorated as one might expect of a ship that old The tour route requires some serious climbing of steep shipboard ladders (stairs for land lubbers). Athletic shoes and loose clothing are highly recommended. People with any physical issues will only be able to tour the main deck but even just that might be worth the visit. As a 20 year navy veteran (carrier pilot), I still found the tour very rewarding and I learned a lot from the historical exhibits throughout the ship's tour. This tour id highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngY9983BS
40,Enjoyable Family Activity,"We really enjoyed checking out the USS Iowa. We've been on other battleships and such, and we didn't get access to as many areas on the Iowa as we have had on other ships. But, we enjoyed all the sights. There are LOTS of ladders/stairs, so use caution if you have little ones. My 5-year old son and his cousins had fun going around and completing the dog scavenger hunt. I didn't feel like there was enough signage or descriptions of everything posted to learn very much about the ship on my own, though. There was a volunteer/worker in one area that talked to us for quite a while and we learned so much from him. That was the best part. Worth a stop, though, if you're in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/668sherih
50,This is One Awesome Ship!,"Nicely restored battleship. This is a massive military ship and a must to see in person and explore. Really made me feel proud of those who have served on their decks for our freedom. The “big guns” on this ship are amazing in size, not to mention the size of the projectiles!This ship is located next door to the Port of Los Angeles cruise terminal and Vincent St Thomas Bridge nearby. During the week is the ideal time to visit’ You’ll have the ship almost all to yourself. Highly recommend seeing when in the LA & Long Beach port areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midwaytoheaven
50,Naval History!!!,I loved the whole battleship experience. So much to see and experience. The guides and volunteers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you to all our serviceman in the States and Canada for keeping us safe!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andriesmx
30,Good but could be much better,"This is the second time I've visited The USS Iowa. What a ship! It was good to see a few more areas open, but also some areas were now closed off. For example we couldn't go into the armoured conning tower which we could last time. My biggest disappointment is that you can't go into any turrets. Battleships are all about big guns, big armour and big engines. You get to see a little bit of the armour(you can see the thickness of the armoured conning tower) but you really miss out in not seeing the guns or engine room. Staff were great, freindly and informative. Worth a visit,but could be so much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/erinon312
40,Interesting History! Wear comfy shoes.,"My daughter and I took the general tour of the USS Iowa. It's a big ship, and you'll be doing a lot of walking, so be sure to have good support for your feet.There were many fascinating tidbits of information and historical aspects to soak in as we perused the inner rooms of this battleship.There are stairs to climb up & down, so this museum/tour may not be for everyone. It also got pretty hot inside the ship (understandable: It was July).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhlegmMaster
30,Other battleships have more access,The Iowa was ok but other battleship have more access to a those ships interior spaces. The Missouri in Pearl Harbor for example,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tom9078
40,Fun place if you like history,"This is a fun place to crawl around if you like history. It is pretty affordable to get in, and they have ample parking. They shoot the guns off periodically and its a blast. Worth a visit if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd
40,A Great Piece of History,"Get your tickets online prior and save a couple of bucks. There is plenty of parking, but it is pay parking that helps raise restoration funds for the USS Iowa. The staff was very knowledgeable about the history of the ship and the restoration that has been performed is excellent and ongoing. There is an online web application that you can download and get additional information about the ship and sites you will see, but we found out so much more just talking to the former sailors who are on-board at different locations around the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgbg100106
50,Awesome firepower and history time machine,"The statistics on the armaments are impressive. You can walk up and touch the big guns. This vessel has had multiple different lives with different technology starting with a mechanical computer to compute trajectories. It is fun to track its re-fittings with newer technology to allow it to contribute during different eras in world history. And they sell some nostalgic candy in the little store. You need to be fit enough to climb up and down a number of narrow stairways/ladders, but if you are it is a fun exploration. Do it with a guide if you can. The extra knowledge they have makes it come alive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K4458SKjohnt
50,USS Iowa is excellent,The Iowa museum is a great visit for those who want to see a real piece of WW2 history. I recommend a visit to anyone who is interested in learning about older naval vessels. It is exciting to see more and more parts of the ship open each year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/navydude121
40,Great Piece of History,"If you are in Long Beach, a visit to the USS Iowa is a worthwhile visit. Taking the tour in the ship however includes narrow passages and steep stairs which might not be for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
50,The time machine,"My father was a Marine in WWII....When dad graduated from college in 1942 (in February) he and the rest of his class marched through Fitarandolph gates made a right turn, and marched down Nassau street to 185 Nassau (high school recruiting station) and directly into the war... And when he came back from the war his only comment to his middle son was ""if you were were not there.. you wouldn't understand."" He never talked about his experiences. But sometimes someone would walk up to him quickly and give him a bear hug. I remember watching a Police Captain in St. Louis Mo. do just that. Dad's first Sergeant (I found out later.)The Iowa is a piece of that history of .. his history, a piece of what happened a piece of what Dad felt was so hard to understand. I can touch the claustrophobic bunks, see the cramped combat spaces in the 5 inch guns where too many men with too little room faced deadly fear that forged bonds that lasted a life time. If I tried hard I could feel the echoes of fear that forges the bonds of brotherhood among men so different and yet so strongly bonded. On the Iowa I can walk back into time to the places he walked, even talk to some of the people who were part of that brotherhood. When dad passed at 96 ... nearly 500 people came to his memorial service -- including many many with canes and wheel chairs. Brothers from a family so close that they came from all over to see him rejoin his ""kin"" in Arlington. Walking the Iowa, is as close to walking back in time as it is possible... it is very easy to put myself in his place. Perhaps understand a bit of his life and times. The bridge is fascinating! But perhaps the bunks and mess are closer to history. The real story is in the iron walls and the tight spaces that shaped an entire generation -- and my father.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lockgod
50,History Lesson (personalized),It was great showing my kids the history of a WWII batttle ship. My father had served on the USS Tennessee during WWII.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colleenmatty
50,Big Stick!,The best overall Battleship Museum ever! We are very fortunate to have Iowa in San Pedro. Our young generation can learn from her history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/325jessel
50,Nice outing for everyone in the family,"We took our grandsons (ages 9 and 5) and they loved it! The very clever scavenger hunt kept them so interested. The volunteers who were there totally engaged the boys. We also learned a lot. There are some steep ladders to climb up and down to take in the entire ship, but it is definitely a Los Angeles gem! It is a delightful learning experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaryG152
50,Well worth a visit,"A chance to explore this iconic and historical ship that should not be missed if you are nearby. Not just for military history buffs, but a fascinating in-site into how this mighty vessel was employed and updated throughout its long and distinguished career.Jaw dropping fire power and the day to day life of the crew that manned her are all explained during the tour, along with their triumphs and tragedies.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IanG298
50,Volunteer Restoration at its BEst,You should look at the before and after pictures to appreciate the amount of money and time that went into bringing this important part of our history to Long Beach. I appreciated walking the several decks as there were interesting details no matter where you turned. To look through the view finders of some of the weaponry and site viewers was a plus. But to see some things I remembered from my childhood actually displayed was a pleasant surprise. Roosevelt's visiting quarters was well done. I also liked the videos strategically placed along the walking tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda

40,Great experience,"So many good things to see. Plenty old salts to explain and assist you along the self guided tour. The Full Steam Ahead tour is great for the person who would like to feel what it was really like abroad the ship. Don't forget your comfy sneakers, you will need them. The decks are still pretty rough for sandals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wingss2fly
50,The ship and show was amazing.,"I never served in the military, nor did any of our four Sons. But we had to demonstrate a lot of pride in seeing how the men and women lived and worked on the USS Iowa. Are two young grandson‘s were thrilled and I especially enjoyed the flyovers and Coast Guard demonstration on how they save someone in the water by helicopter. The ship itself is an amazing experience and I would recommend it to anyone, especially those with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cosmopolitan572405

50,A Fun Step Back In Time for the Whole Family,"This is a phenomenal, family oriented ""history lesson"" brought to life in a fun, family engaging, enjoyable way. The preservation of the exhibits is incredible - from details such as what the men ate, their bunks, the captain's quarters, pictures of Presidents who visited, and the behind the scenes stories that bring history to life. This is one the whole family can enjoy - from challenging toddlers (there is a ""find the dog"" fun scavenger hunt for kids) to challenging grandparents. There is truly something for everyone. Don't miss it - out of all the exhibits similar in the area, this one was by far the most enjoyable for all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/354dorothys

We learned about what Einstein is reported to have called the most complex machine created by humankind at that time. It is the ship customized for FDR's trip to Tehran during WWII. Holding around 2,800 sailors, it was a floating city. Above all, it was a destroyer and the namesake of a class of destroyer ships during WWII, Korean War and Vietnamese War.

My son said it was his favorite part of our trip to California. It was interesting to all of us to see the huge ship and to see how the men lived. Their living quarters were quite small.

All veterans feel a connection to this ship that played in important role in a couple of different wars. For people that never served in the military, feel compelled to see personal memorabilia on display. You will have a new appreciation for personnel living and combat areas. You will learn about the ships offensive and defensive weapons. The Ships Store sell clothing and other collectables. A lot of opportunities to take pictures of USS Iowa and surrounding Port of Los Angeles scenes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9929LXjohnw

50,A piece if history,My family enjoyed our afternoon outing. Took a good 2 hours to see everything. Was very cool to see and read up on the history. Lots of narrow type ladder steps so watch out if you have young kids or people with low mobility. We had a 2 Nd 8 year old and it was fine. Self guided tour and you go at your own pace. There is also an android and apple app that guides you. AAA gets 25% off if you buy your tickets online.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamuelFHuang
50,A must see! Incredible part of history!,"I am not a big military buff or history person, but it was incredible to see what our military personnel sacrificed in WWII and the conditions they endured on board this ship. I would encourage all to go see it. It’s amazing. Thank you to those who serve in our military!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williammH3560LJ

50,Very interesting visit,"Although I don't like much war related issues, visiting an authentic war ship is very interesting. Old crew explained in a very detailed way some adventures. It's worth buying the combo ticket for Iowa Battleship and Queen Mary, as you can visit them in different ways.Parking's available but very expensive but parking in the surroundings is free and possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adelvalle76
50,Fascinating and immersive experience,My Dad spent three years during WWII serving on the Iowa and my husband served on the Midway and the Forrestal so we just had to tour the Iowa. What a immersive and fascinating experience! We took the Full Steam Ahead Tour and loved it. The two hour tour included the engineering sections. Can you imagine analog computing? Wow! The tour guides were safety conscious with our small group and regaled is with engaging stories and surprising facts. Be prepared to climb MANY ladders but it is worth it! Download the app for the full experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolb174
50,"Great self-guided tour, wish we could have seen more","My husband is a huge military history nerd, so visiting the Battleship Iowa was a must when we came to LA. We arrived just after opening and stayed until about 1:30 in the afternoon. We bought the individual membership because it will also give us access to the Midway and the New Jersey (which we'll do when we get home).Once aboard the ship, the docents are eager to share their knowledge. One of their docents was particularly knowledgeable about the workings of the antiaircraft machinery since he operated them on the Wisconsin (part of the same battleship class). We explored the ship at our own pace and read all the placards and watched all the videos. It was extremely informative and wonderfully done.One thing we wish we could have done was to be able to explore the other parts of the ship. That particular tour was only available on weekends and we were only in town from Monday through Thursday. :( We had the ability to see the bowels of an aircraft carrier at another museum, so we were hoping to do the same here. Hopefully we will be able to come back and tour the other parts of the ship.If you struggle with stairs, the ship's stairs were particularly steep, so if you're not comfortable having to go down a flight of stairs backwards, then you might struggle a bit on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecV9554YM
50,Impressive Ship - Good Self-Guided Tour,Seeing all of this up-close really was impressive. It was hot - so be prepared with water and sunscreen as you are out on the decks quite a bit. The docents were all very interesting and just meeting and talking with them was a great experience.The announce any active or veteran military guests as they enter the ship - that was a very nice and humbling experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/937paulettef
40,Great midday visit with Harbour Cruise,"We arrived at approx 11.30 am and were hungry as still feeling the effects of jet lag.We stopped at Pappys first and had Shrimp Po-Boy, Burger, BBQ Chicken and Kids chicken tenders. Food was great approx $50 for the four of us. You even sit on crates to eat which the kids loved.There are toilets outside the tour I would recommend going as we couldn’t find anymore till the end. Also all the drink machines were out of order so please take some water with you.We purchased the USS Iowa and Harbour Cruise tickets which seemed great value at $ 84We were welcomed on board and the children given a treasure hunt style task.

50,"Bigger, Badder, and Grayer than a herd of ill tempered elephants","Full disclosure here, I am a battleship nerd of epic proportions- I have toured every battleship in the United States and have studied the Iowa class extensively. In fact, the only reason I was willing to go to Los Angeles is because they wouldn't tow the ship to Oregon for me. That said, the USS Iowa is an important part of our history and represents the ultimate evolution of a concept that goes back hundreds of years. The engineering involved in bringing a ship like this to life is incredible and needs to be seen to be truly appreciated. While not as fully accessible as the other Iowa class ships since it was the last to be converted into a museum and there are still some navy restrictions on how the ship can be modified, it is the only such vessel on the entire west coast and a must see for anyone who appreciates our military's sacrifices, technology, or fans of pure awesome metal crushing firepower (imagine as many Tim Allen type grunts here as you feel appropriate).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unavid

Find all 10 and get a cool prize! A good way to get the kids engaged in US history, get some exercise, and be outside! Plus if you are from Iowa, you get in FOR FREE! Just show your Iowa DL. What a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckythirtykate
50,Appreciated being able to tour this historic battleship,"The USS Iowa is self guided tour which is very well laid out and easy to follow. Nice guides who are knowledgeable and approachable. Be aware that most of tour is on deck and in very hot interior rooms. We unfortunately visited on one of the hottest days of the year, so by the time we got to the (very nice) gift shop, I had to leave my husband behind and head for the air conditioned car lest I pass out.We did the USS Iowa/Queen Mary combo ticket which did save some money, but surprised to find out that the USS Iowa is not near Queen Mary at all, it's quite a drive away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gypsymamma

The Battleship was filled with visitors who, like our group, were able to ask questions of the volunteers who responded with an obviously keen knowledge of its background. We learned later that USS IOWA was the last duty station of one of the members of tour, bringing tears to the eyes of many of us. Thank you USS IOWA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421dianej

50,Iowa Class Battleships are Just Awesome Feats of Engineering,"We tried to combine our visit to the Iowa with a visit to the Queen Mary which is just down (up?) the road from the Iowa. There is a presentation and a psuedo-tour you can take but most of the things you can see are on the main deck or above. I visited the New Jersey when I served in the late 70's/early 80's and it was on active duty so I was disappointed that we could not visit the engineering spaces. We also took a tour boat around the harbor and got to see the ship from the ""ocean"" side. I visited the Missouri in Pearl Harbor. The only Iowa class battleship left to see is the Wisconsin in Norfolk, VA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiKershaw77

They have self-guided tours (you get to go through the ship at your own pace), or guided tours (where a tour guide can take you around and explain all the exhibits).Fun for the whole family and very kid-friendly! I wouldn't recommend this for people with small children or strollers, as the ship tour has narrow hallways and stairs.And you can take pictures everywhere! The ship's small shop at the end also has some interesting things to pick up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NekoBabbles
50,Great battleship,WE found it very interesting and educational. History of the ship was fascinating. All persons we met were very personable and knowledgeable. Obviously passionate about their work. Ship was in great condition considering the effort required to stay ahead of the elements. We combined our visit with a harbor tour which I would highly recommend to get the best visuals of the entire ship. I am glad this ship is being maintained as a significant part of our military history and being here for many generations to come.

I felt kind of strange exploring such a national anthem that once upon a time had thousands of sailors on board doing their very best to contain an enemy and knowing that they may not come back home. As a former military member who has had to respond to the call of duty in rather harsh environments, I salute you all. Make sure to write your service experience down on the note pad when you board, as they will welcome you personally for the branch of service you were in over the ships PA system. It was pretty neat to walk through the ship and try to see how they all lived while on board. I was glad me and my family experienced it, and I plan to take the more lengthy tour the next time I'm in California.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigquata

The guides are helpful and the day we were there a gentleman who had been at the wheel during WWII was there, fascinating to meet and listen to him!It's not a total 1940s nostalgia trip as the crew spaces were updated in the 1980s.What you visit is all above the main deck, it would be nice if there were cameras or something in the engineering spaces so you could see the engines, magazines, etc. Hopefully as time goes on there will be a tour for those of us young enough to handle steep ladders below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelandreski

We particularly enjoyed Doug Williams, a veteran and volunteer, who described the World War II missions of USS Iowa with a huge world map, in a wonderful way.

50,Not to be missed!,"The Battleship USS Iowa is a historical gem, taken out of mothballs and saved from being used as target practice. It is a floating museum which is being restored as funds are available, so what I saw in July 2018 may be a little different from what visitors will see in the future. The guides are full of knowledge and interesting tidbits of information, and they readily answer questions. Children are given a ""game card"" and they mark off the numbered pictures of a dog that are placed around the ship. This was President Roosevelt's ship, so a unique thing is that it was outfitted with a bathtub, which is still there. Ladders between levels are rather steep and narrow, but anyone who can handle steps shouldn't have a problem with them. Iowa residents are admitted free if they show an Iowa driver's licence or ID.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X4644YXronaldb

50,Fantastic ship with a lot of history,"The Iowa is one of great battleships of the past that is definitely a “must do” when visiting the L.A. area. Even if you don’t know anything about naval ships or the history, your family will enjoy this floating museum.The Iowa was launched in 1943 and was active in WWII, the Korean War, and conducted many operations during the Cold War era. It has hosted 3 presidents and unfortunately suffered mass casualties when an explosive accident occurred in turret two in 1989.Just seeing how the turrets worked and were manned is worth the tour, let alone seeing all the great spaces above and below decks.There are many ladderwells to navigate so wear practical and comfortable footwear. If you’re not used to or ever been on a Naval ship, ladderwells, hatches, and height clearances can all pose problems if you’re not paying attention or wearing less than practical clothing. Also, use the restroom before you start the tour because the next available ones are at the end of an hour and a half to two hour walking tour.In the hotter months, spaces below deck can be warm and a little stuffy. However, that should not stop you from visiting this gem of U.S. naval power and history.There is a separate charge for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bubuflu

It is not easy to find but has plenty of parking so don't be afraid to drive there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjbales

She had pleasant ""flashbacks"" of the three tier racks, ladder wells, and mess area. Definately a must see for an ""old salt"".

50,Great monument to history,Good lesson in history for young and old. Tour takes you throughout the ship. You'll see the dining areas for officers and enlisted as well as enlisted and officer quarters. You'll also see the room where President Theodore Roosevelt and others signed. Tour takes about 90 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parcifal94
40,Iowa Battleship Tour,I found it very interesting. The only negative part was there were not many restrooms available. The search for the dog mascot kept the children interested.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fbbiank
50,Fantastic,"Touching and seeing history helps bring a greater appreciation for those that followed before me. It helped me realize how tremendous the efforts were that went into designing, building and operating such a magnificent ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbohleber

50,Working trip,Highly recommend this tour. It was great to see a part of American history. We spent over two hours on with the self guided tour. What an amazing piece of history. Being from Iowa it was a great to see this ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BruceVW
40,Excellent Day Trip,"Interesting exhibit, knowledgeable docents, scavenger hunt for our small kids with a token prize at the end. I recommend downloading the app ahead of time. You can even save money by purchasing your tickets on the app and skip the lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryd840
50,A great history experience,"The USS Iowa is well worth seeing and was a highlight to our LA stop over. From the minute you board her the welcoming party were men that actually served on her, and not some young person who really didn't know her interesting history. The retired men made the whole experience fantastic. They were so enthusiastic on explaining the way that the ship functioned and how everything worked. The 'Iowa' is one of the best military displays that we had seen any where in the world, which just makes us investigate the other great USS navy ships also on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonnaM2482
50,Outstanding,"Had been looking foward to this day,all I can say Outstanding!! All the work that has been done. looking to return very soon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rnab1
40,Barrleship Iowa,"Went on Father's Day - had a great time! Lots of docents, former Vets to enrich the visit with their experiences. Videos on board good, too. Definitely worth seeing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathrynguyer
50,Really cool piece of history!,"We were visiting from FL and being former Navy I wanted my wife to see this. We were not disappointed! It is being preserved as well as can be expected, There is plenty to do and see on the ship. What people these days don't realize is this is a war ship, not a Disney ride! Enjoy the history of our Nation and our Navy. The men that fought with this ship are not only no longer with us, but irreplaceable!We loved it and have respect for those trying to preserve it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike3022
50,Fathers' Day Visit of USS Iowa,I took my dad on Fathers' Day. He is a Navy veteran. The experience was great. My dad was piped aboard and announced. The volunteers working the ship are very knowledgeable and friendly. I would recommend this trip for anyone interested in history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/340williamw
50,Just keeps getting better!,"Full steam ahead tour was great! Got to see parts of the ship not usually open to the public. New and updated exhibits in the regular tour from the last time we were there a couple years ago too. Enjoyed talking with the staff and volunteers aboard. They now have a little food stand next to the ship with burgers, sandwiches, etc. Cheeseburger was really good. Overall, husband and I had a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadySilverbow
50,Glimpse into the Past,"This was a Father's Day excursion that we did for my Dad and my Sister's Husband. We were 9 altogether and really enjoyed our visit aboard the ship. The best part were the retired vets/volunteers on hand to answer our questions. They were all really great to talk to! I also loved the museum and there is a well rounded gift shop with something for everybody. I would recommend planning time to do a little shopping. They have lots of fun souvenir items are the clothing is well designed. Lots of cute stuff. I would allow about 3-4 hours to see it all. There is so much to see! I would like to go back and do one of the more private tours. Afterwards we had lunch at Pappy's Seafood on 6th street, which is delicious. It was a great way to end a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/951mirta
50,A definite must see!,"This ship is truly spectacular! Getting to actually board a piece of history like this was an incredible experience. The ship’s careful restoration paired with knowledgeable staff and incredible video, audio, artifacts, and photographs make it an overwhelmingly impressive experience. This not-so-excited-about-history gal wil definitely be returning to explore more! The self-guided tour entertained my 5- and 7-year olds all the way up to grandma and grandpa. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesedica
50,Beautiful Ship,This is one of the best attractions in Los Angeles. The ship is beautiful and full of history. What a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mnlcooper
50,History at your fingertips,"A trip aboard the USS Iowa is a majestic experience. History read from (text)books, novels and/or magazines do not reveal the sheer magnitude of endeavors undertaken, battles fought, lives tragically lost and wars heroically won. It's trips as on the Iowa that makes history relevant, realistic and most importantly tangible.Allow yourself at least 4 hours to cover the entire breadth. Ladies, please do not wear long heels. The doors are quite low and the stairs steep. Start the day early. Parking is free for first hour and $2 for each subsequent hours. After the trip head over to the Fish Market (about a mile away) to dine on the famous Shrimp tray. Parking at the market is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rcpais
50,A Great Honor To Go On Board,It is with great honor we were allowed on board the USS Iowa! It’s an absolute must for any parents with children. They will never forget the day you took them on this battleship. How many people can say they actually were on a battleship? She was really something in her day and still is. 16” diameter guns! Presidents were on this shipDocents help out with your questions. A very nice Docent named AL helped us. What a nice man!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happytoberetired
50,The Volunteers Care,...unlike the Queen Mary where they just want your money.The Battleship Iowa was impressive because of the caring volunteers who are informative.It's a lot of up down down up and it's a big ship.Special for kids: Kids are handed a sheet where they have to find the ship dog at certain locations. At the end they turn it in and get an Iowa Dog Tag and Iowa sticker. Very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4dealchic
50,"A unique experience, especially if you are from the midwest","Being from Kansas, we don't get too many opportunities to tour a battleship, so even though we had been there before, we took our two 10 year old grandsons. We didn't have a lot of time, but they both enjoyed seeing the size of everything up close and hearing the stories of its real battles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinJerry
50,Fun day at the harbor!,My son and I visited the Iowa when he was a senior in high school and as both of us were history buffs we enjoyed the visit immensely. As a son of a naval officer myself I grew up around various types of naval vessels but the battleship has always fascinated me. This ship is a piece of history of an era when the greatest generation fought back the evil of the time and preserved our democracy. The trip to the Iowa was well worth the drive from Bakersfield and I will likely return in the future. This is a must visit for anyone visiting this area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1488IXjamesw
50,Trip for the boys,"Loved it, was a must see for me while the ladies were shopping for the day.Bit hard to get around if you are disabled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/860darrend
50,So wonderful,"The USS IOWA is a wonderful ship to visit and learn about. The ship is packed full of rich history from the early 1940's through the late 1980's. I happened to stay on board overnight and was able to have a fun experience of sleeping in the bunks where previous sailors stayed in during its hay day. It has made trips all over the world; had presidents aboard, as well as a five star general! They treat you well on this ship and teach you so many things as if you were in a history class. It is just a very unique experience and if given the opportunity to go aboard again I would, it was a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cod615
50,An Impressive Tour,"This is a very impressive restoration. Before you take the tour you can download an app that will help guide you around the ship. There is a lot to see and be impressed with as you walk the decks and explore this historic ship. There are guides posted around the ship that were willing to answer questions and point out various features of the ship. The tour is easy to follow as there are arrows marked on the sides of walls and on the deck. From the guns, to the living quarters, to the galley to the heavily armoured command center, you will be impressed with the design of this ship as a war machine. It even has the remains of the cruise missal launchers and other high tech weapons that were installed in the last years of its life. A souvenir shop is available at the end of the tour. If you are a veteran, identify yourself for a special ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan2000
50,More impressive than even some of the reviews would indicate...,"The 16"" armor-piercing rounds of the IOWA can penetrate THIRTY feet of reinforced concrete, not ""three feet."" And IOWA is not a ""destroyer."" She's a Battleship. Each of her three turrets weighs as much as some destroyers.An amazing example of US Industrial Art and Design and Craftsmanship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/i0wa61
50,WOW. A must see.,"I must confess that I am slightly biased as a history nerd... but this is a must see! The sheer size of this ship is impressive.I went on Full Steam Ahead (FSA) tour, and it was amazing. It’s in groups of 10 and led by extremely knowledgeable guides. It’s $50 but it includes the general admission in case you want to do the self guided tour afterwards. I did, because the FSA tour is exclusively dedicated to areas that are not accessible with the general admission (engine room, fire control, etc).This is a great mid to full day activity, even for kids! They have a special kid’s tour. Be sure to download the app to access the self guided tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fernandezer
50,Great Docents and Surprisingly High Tech Tour,Who would have thought that the tour of the Battleship Iowa would have so many cool high tech options? My teenagers loved that. I was impressed by the docents - very knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abbyandchris17
50,My experiences as a docent aboard the Iowa.,"As a docent aboard the USS Iowa, I really enjoy all the visitors who come aboard the Iowa for some really great Naval History to explore. I know all are impressed with the beauty and size of the ship, the hugeness of the 16 inch guns, the many areas visited on the ship and the museum and gift shop at the end of the tour. It is a self-guided tour so take your time, take all the pictures you want and follow the yellow arrows. There is also an APP on your phone as you tour the ship. The cost is $18.00 per person, no charge for active duty military or you can show residency in the state of Iowa. This is one tour you will never forget and I am sure many visitors come back for more visits. Some things to know before you visit the ship are: wear close-toed shoes to protect your feet, be aware that you will be climbing steel stairs or ladders, the tour will take at least 2-3 hours depending on how much time visitors take at each area, children are welcome but keep a close watch on them and enjoy. If you have any questions there are docents around the ship to answer the. Our hours are 10 AM to 5 PM every day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4875MOpaulp
40,Very Interesting Tour,"There is lots to see and absorb during the main tour. It was very nice to have the opportunity to meet and talk to a navy veteran. We also did the behind the scenes tour which was more technical and provided you with a more detailed look at the ship. All the staff from the gift shop, to tour guides to ticket sellers to security were exceptionally polite and helpful. Definitely created some long lasting memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irenemcw
50,Eye opening,Staff were very friendly and accomodating. I like self paced tours and never felt the need to rush during my tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dolphbear
50,Spring Break 2018 with grand daughter,"Conspired with my daughter to take my 8 YO grand daughter fishing/Knotts Berry and The Iowa. This was my 2nd visit have boarded once prior while berthed in Richmond. Her maternal grand parents were both Navy. Grandpa Mose did 20 as a Machinist Mate. 17 on the Midway. That is he how he met his wife in Norfolk. She was very impressed with the ship, enjoyed the simulator ride and has worn her USS Iowa beany to school....in San Francisco...brave kid!She is in great shape BUT having the Hornet just 10 miles away I know how the paint tends to peel so I suggest that all Vets regardless being Army, Marines, CG or AF give the old lady a tip for the paint fund. Army 73-82.Next stop for her is The Hornet then Spring break 19 to the Midway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ssgwayne2000biz
50,Thunderous!,Great piece of history for future generations. It shows what Americans can accomplish when challenged.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymike27
50,Second time aboard.,"It was very interesting, took a friend. I had been on the ship in Norfolk when it was heading for the straits of Hormuz, my son was a gunner. He is deceased now, and I wanted to see it again. Found his picture in one of the displays, very touching.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9359GMjohn
50,Well Worth The Trip,"The tour was so informative and educational. The size of the vessel can only be understood by walking through it and experiencing its immensity. It helped me to understand what our military goes through, daily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninagE5766PL
50,Scout Overnight Success,"I took my Girl Scout troop to the USS Iowa for their overnight program. It was us and a Boy Scout Troop. It was very fun, informative and interesting. The girls had a great time, learned a lot and loved being on the Ship and sleeping in the bunks. Food was catered and brought in, wasn't the most amazing food, but was a lot better than many of the Girl Scout camp menu's we've had. Overall I highly recommend doing this. For the adults it can be a little emotionally draining as you realize much of what's being discussed is wars and lots of deaths, but for the kids it's just an interesting piece of history and the Tour Guides are Navy or Military Veterans that were on that ship or others like it. It's also a great place to just visit for the day, checking out all the levels and museum. The ship is huge, lots to see and plenty of people along the way to explain things and information posted throughout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalidiosa
50,Worthwhile,Enjoyable and historic. Worth the time. We were accompanied by a docent who was very knowledgeable and took time to answer questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevegraff12

50,Respecting our navy and the men wo served,The tour is well worth the time. The condition of the ship is remarkable. The volunteers were very we;; informed. I would like to see the engine room and mechanical systems opened up to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelvinR236
50,Fun tour with grandson,The tour was amazing and was thoroughly enjoyed by me and my grandson (13). The ship was in amazing shape for being so old. My only suggestion is that you should have some place where people can make donations for the upkeep of the ship in the store.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterbW4339CD
50,A Walk Through Naval HIstory,"Not having served, but having lived through some of the Iowa's commissions, along with being an engineer, I found it fascinating to see the changes in technology over the life of this battleship.This is a must for any service member... especially if you served in the Navy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/borntotravelandcan
50,Great exhibit and learning experience,"Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. My dad and I are both veterans, which earned us a bit of a special tour for the family. My three teenage boys loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parents520
40,Lots of cool history,Very cool to be able to access different areas of the ship. The self guided tour does not work very well as the app bumps you out. They have Veterans stationed in different areas and you can ask them questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yvonneorduno
50,Great experience!,I went to the Iowa with my wife and daughter who is in college. We had a fantastic time exploring the ship. Next time I want to arrange for a more detailed exploration so I can visit other parts of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsbrindle
50,Impressive and Honored,"As a U.S. Navy veteran myself, I felt a bit nostalgic, impressed and honored to be welcomed the board and my arrival publicly announced. I had always wanted to tour a battleship and I was not disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T9241WKscotth
50,Great Visit,"I went because a friend was visiting and her son is interested in ships. I was not. Therefore, I was completely surprised by how interesting I found the whole thing, from the way it was built, to the events it was part of, to it's FDR connection, etc. etc. I'd only experienced a US battleship in movies. Being on and inside the real thing was a moving experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginab06

50,visiting from Alabama,"I consider myself a history buff especially the Civil War and the World Wars, But I learned so much on the guided tour, I had planned just a quick visit we ended up staying over three hours. I took my 31 year old daughter and was afraid she would lose interest, she surprised me how the Iowa fascinated her. I hated to see the old teak wood deck falling apart in places. In some places it looked new. I would love to bring my Grand kids one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidcbarnett

50,An integral part of world history since 1942,"A must-see attraction in LA. The restored Battleship Iowa is an incredible experience. You will leave humbled by bravery of the former crew members who shaped the history of the United States, and indeed the history of the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chief1120
50,Great Battleship,I really enjoyed the overall history of the ship and the way the information was displayed. The arrows on deck were very helpful so you knew exactly where to go. The displays were very interesting and definitely worth visiting if you are into historical war ships.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RD1945
50,Fun and educational!,"Staff was friendly. Cool place to visit, took my 11 & 7 yr old and they had fun exploring and learning. Will definitely return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flowerv01

50,16,"This was very personal for me as I worked form 1968-1975 at the Naval Ordnance Station Indian Head Md. where, for the early part of that period, I was the engineer responsible for making and blending the cannon powder for the 16 inch guns (and the 8 inch guns). The ship is a great museum but more so, it is filled with history and provides a first hand view of life on board. GREAT. You should not miss this opportunity to go back in time to the glory days of this wonderful ship",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbf214
50,Fun on the water,"Its scenic, its educational, its a nice walk around the ship!Everyone is so friendly and eager to share stories about the ship. Its nice to see the ship getting in better condition with all the TLC from the volunteers. The smell of the ocean, watching the activity from the cruise lines, great restaurants in the area. Its a big winner?Be sure to bring your camera and spend a few bucks at the ships store at the end of the self tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bporter5
50,What a ship,I did not allow myself enough time. I spent 3 hours hurrying through the ship trying to take it all in. I enjoyed every moment with exception of having to leave. A very interesting ship with a history that covers many years. My hats off to the volunteers and the people that are preserving this piece of history and making it accessible to the public. Make sure to allow yourself enough time to see and read the information about the ship and its history of service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcl0ss0n
50,The Docents Make It Come Alive,Had a great tour. Went on a weekday and had the place to ourselves. The docents weren't too busy and were able to spend a lot of time with us. Our particular docents had served on this ship so it was really interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irarubinson

50,Iowa cisit,Very worthy visit. Lots of history on this great ship. Thanks for the volunteers love and care for this ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/28alexpang
50,An awe inspiring experiance,"As a former NAVY man, I have graced the decks of an LPD, and a couple bird farms. The one trait they all share and the Iowa is no different, is the smells associated with a naval vessel. The similarities, for me, end there. The Battleship tour was one I will not forget as it is a marvel of mechanics and truly a sight to behold. A very unique ship with graceful lines which was constructed for two purposes the first of which was to give the opposition a moment of pause and the second was to unleash fury against the opposition that failed to take that moment of pause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brandtrobert
50,Fascinating,This was a fabulous museum. There was lots to see. Anyone who likes history will love this. Great for teens and adults,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathysL1446UI
50,"Real ship, real veterans, real deal","This might not be for everyone, but it is a unique experience to be able to talk to Navy veterans about their experience and to see the marvel of engineering that is the USS Iowa.

50,Great self guided tour of a historical battleship,"We came here after getting off a cruise, and had a wonderful time on the self-guided tour. Most of the displays have well-written descriptions, making it possible to understand the use and significance of the many parts of the ship. The gift shop, at the end of the tour, is nice also. The flight simulator (separate fee required) isn't so great, so I would recommend skipping it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vetism
50,Wonderful piece of history,"I cannot say enough about our day on board the Iowa.We were blessed to have our friend who is a retired Rear Admiral who happened to have spent 4 months on the ship.On arrival to the ship they ask current or retired military to sign in and they are announced over the loud speakers.Because of our friend we were given a private tour of the ship by one of the volunteers (Don), who even though he was not in the military was extremely knowledgable about the ship.It was an honor to walk where presidents had walked, peace treaties were signed and history was made.God bless our military, past, present, and future, and God bless the USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grpandnana
50,Great Day,This was one of our primary objectives of the trip and it sure did not disappoint. The ship is in remarkable shape.

They are doing a fabulous job restoring / preserving her for future patrons to enjoy. please consider a donation to help with her maintenance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chevdiver
50,One Of The Best Living Museums RE:USA History,"Located minutes from the Cabrillo Aquarium and beach (great to do if visiting IOWA BB-61), the battleship is a must-see attraction. We brought our 6-year old grand son who loved climbing the steps, getting on top of the captains seat and measuring up to the missiles.Staffed by volunteer ex-military, the self-guided tour takes about an hour although you can spend more time. You get to tour pretty much the entire ship including living quarters, kitchen, equipment room and mess hall. Be prepared to climb five levels, some stairs very narrow.During WWII, BB-61 (BB stands for battleship), some 2500 were deployed. The ship saw service in the 80's and then was retired. Quite fascinating and surely more appreciated for the servicemen after the tour.Don't waste your money on the simulator. Run by third party vendor and not related to the IOWA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LGspartan
40,Nice self guided tour,"We spent a couple hours walking through the self guided tour. While it was very interesting and a must do for naval history buffs, it would have been much better if the app was working to provide audio at various locations. Unfortunately no one was able to help us to get it working. Fortunately, there were enough placards with information, a couple of very knowledgeable veterans giving presentations and my husband who is a history buff!We bought our admission as part of the create your own Go Card.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ITravl4Fun
50,Great History,"I decided to visit this one morning. The drive itself is pretty neat going through the ship yards. The ship itself is cool. They only have about 25% of the ship open for visitors which I would have liked to see more. Still the amount you see and information they offer makes you feel like you were on this ship at one time. This ship was used up till 1989 so there is more ""recent"" technology rather than just WWII technology. Highly recommend visiting this piece of history",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/electrical_steve
40,Excellent display of Naval history,If you are in the San Pedro area you should certainly take the opportunity to visit the Battleship Iowa and learn about its role in U.S. Naval history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,"9-16 inch guns, enough said!!!","Very nice self guided tour, just follow the yellow arrows.

Fun for the whole family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kingsville_Mike
50,The Battleship of Presidents,Had a great time touring the Battleship. Many of the volunteers had served aboard the ship. Saw the bath tub created for President Roosevelt for his famous visit to Tehran. A lot to see and do. Appreciated them announcing the names of veterans visiting that day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minotranger
50,My kids and I loved it,"First off, it is outstanding that the ship's speakers thank every servicemember that comes on board personally by name, rank, where they served, etc. It's such a nice thing to do.The ship is great, informative, honors and is a great place for twin 5-year-olds to see a battleship! I HIGHLY recommend going. We trekked all the way from Santa Clarita and it was just a perfect day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sportspup
40,A top gun experience,"Visited the Battleship Iowa Museum early on Easter Sunday. The attraction opened at 10AM and there were only a few people, so we had plenty of opportunity to look around and get a sense of this enormous vessel. It is worthwhile to see the complexity and power that this ship represents. There are a number of steep stairiways to climb up and down, and good closed toe shoes are suggested. This is not for smaller children who would have a hard time on the stairways. There is a gift shop that seemed well stocked and a museum that seemed quite interesting, however, we did not have time to peruse those two stops on the self-guided tour. Reason being that my son and I had purchased tickets to the ""Full Steam Ahead Tour"" which began just 50 minutes after the opening time to the ship. This special tour accommodates only 10 people max, and we had 8 on the two hour tour. The Full Steam Ahead tour cost almost $50 per person, and was well worth it. We were escorted through the lower decks into the engine room, steam generating room, gunnery firing room and other parts of the ship that the self guided tour does not enter. We received a lot of interesting information about how the ship operated and life aboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615edwards

50,Impressive.,"It took a while for me to navigate the metro system to get here from where I was staying in Hollywood but it was really worth it.Great to see how the hard work that the volunteers have put into the USS Iowa has paid off.

50,Awesome Experience For This Iowan,"Incredible experience to be aboard the USS Iowa. The ship is full of history and actually takes a fair amount of time to tour. Being from Iowa, we were able to tour it for free. We also appreciated being able to actually touch and experience so many of the things on the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PowerTrippersTravel

50,Fun and unique experience,From beginning to end it was amazing. Staff very friendly and engaging. My nephews loved the scavenger hunt and I secretly enjoyed too as the adult. Would definitely come again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bholley14
50,Well worth a visit (if you’re into that type of thing),"If you’re one of those people who is impressed by military hardware, then check this out. Still an awesome looking ship and allows an excellent self guided tour, to most parts of the ship. Staff, many who are ex-shipmates, you meet along the way are excellent, happy to assist and very informative. Money and time well spent. Tip - if you’re asking for staff to take a photo for you, don’t bother telling them how to use your camera, because there is no suitable answer to the question “You telling a marine how to shoot?”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazc165
50,Very informative,A very good self guided tour of an important piece of our Naval history. There were several volunteers there to answer any questions you may have a long the way. I'd highly recommend seeing this ship,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mgab327
40,Great History Exhibit,Spent most of the day at this lovely attraction. Some inside and some outside exhibits. Lots of information to read about. Good restoration efforts.

50,The only one on the west coast. Great tour,"Great tour. All the docents I met were all former navy guys. All them truly cared about this historic ship and all know what was going on to very minor details. We were able to talk one of them to give us a private tour, the side stories were awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/482armanp
40,Interesting peek into our navel past,"Having never been on a battleship before this self guided tour was fascinating. There is an app that you can download that provides a rich audio tour. Because we were from Iowa, we received free admission to the ship. It was amazing to me that this ship had served the US for so many years and that it was remodeled several times to meet the needs of day. There are a number of stairs and low headroom in places. Great museum with very helpful volunteer on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/conversekl
50,Battleship History,Very good tour just to see how huge and powerful these vessels are had to pay a visit as my visit last year to Pearl Harbour and going on the USS Missouri BB-63 had me amazed at the size and capability these things have. Will be going down to San Diego next time as well to check out the one down there.Cheers Brett from Hastings Point Australia.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrettSOk68

50,USS Iowa Battleship,"We visited the USS Battleship Iowa on February 20, 2018. We were impressed with the warm welcome we received as veterans of the U.S. Air Force. They took our military information and announced our rank, name, and branch of service that we had entered the ship. All the volunteers were friendly and informative. The route to visit the ship is nicely laid out and easy to follow. Very informative, history tour of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janshaughnessy
50,Fantastic!,Loved the Iowa and it’s historical significance and learning about battle ships and their workings. Will visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresalN1492ZU
50,It gets better every time I visit,"I've been a Plank Owner and supporting member of the USS Iowa since it first arrived in San Pedro. I saw it in Richmond, CA when it looked like an old WWII ship. Over the years, the Iowa Team has transformed the ship into one of SoCal's premier museum sites. The hard work the volunteers have put in has resulted in a fantastic tribute to one of the greatest ships to ever fly the US Flag. And, it just keeps getting better. Every time I visit, there is something new to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,"Christmas gift first visit, followed by 2nd visit escorting visiting Brother-in-law","My first visit was a gift from my eldest Daughter and her Son. I was so impressed with the knowledge and attention received by ships Docents that I decided to escort my Brother-in-law visiting from Iowa. He of course boarded free and being an Army veteran and lover of WWII history, was thrilled to see and feel the honor we fellow IOWANS have for saving this ship for posterity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjsjdeiling
50,Great old lady,Beautiful ship; illustrious history; we were a group of 22 and had a great guide. He was very knowledgeable and patient.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19madelinew
30,Fabulous for history buffs,"Besides the massive ship and the history surrounding it there are not actual activities except walking and climbing. My husband and adult son loved it for the history and their fascination with the munition and naval power and design. I enjoyed being able to see the inside and the living facilities.Can’t imagine how intimidated a young 18 year must have been if he left his small town and boarded the ship for the first time to go to war. Bless their souls for their sacrifices-every one of them.A word of caution : If you have any disabilities or are an older person with walking issues (knee, hip, etc ) this might not be the tour for you. There are almost totally vertical stairs with very small steps on every level that you have to climb up or down. You have to place your foot sideways and hang on to bars, ropes or chains. No outlet once you start as you are basically climbing up and down the ship as the sailors did.A very worthwhile couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janisi2014
40,A nice find,Had no idea the Iowa was hidden along the LA Waterfront. Glad we found it. My little one is a military history buff and my older one (who hates history) learned a thing or two too. Just walking on deck and seeing the size of the guns is amazing. Seeing how small the ship is compared to the cruise ships of today is also eye opening. Looking forward to going back if/when they can open up the inside of one of the turrets to the public. A must if you are a history buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/428stus
50,"The beautiful USS Iowa, I living piece of History.","I had a great time visiting the USS Iowa. I'm a sucker for military history, as a military member myself, I enjoyed the whole tour. I got to meet a WW2 veteran, a great man from the greatest generation with amazing stories. The whole ship and knowledgeable guides to tell you about the ship's history and capabilities, as well as how the sailors lived. I plan on going again next time I'm in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jesus97v
50,Fantastic ship,What a pleasure walking the deck of the USS Iowa. A trip into history. Can't wait to come back. Plenty of information everywhere. Ship is in great shape.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee566635
40,Third time now. Getting better. Still room to improve,"My third trip there now. Better than the last two trips but still some room for improvement. A lot of things can be improved but I know that there are limitations that they can only do so much with 75 year old ship.Still not a lot of volunteers on board to answer your questions. We were there on a Monday. Saw just two guys that could answer questions for us. One of them was a bit too eager to show us pictures on his phone: Pictures of IOWA from Wikipedia. We did see a third guy in the Wardroom talking to guests. His story just went on and on and on. We came in after he had started, stayed ten minutes, and then left. No idea how long he talked but it sure took away a lot of your time to see other parts of the ship. Also we got trapped by two guys near the signal flag box. Instead of answering questions, they just started talking about flags and after a while we politely excused ourselves. Again, too long for one exhibit.The little ""museum"" that has recently been built down near the gift shop is very good. Lots of history about USN and Iowa. Very good displays and video shows. You could almost spend as much time there as you did throughout the rest of the ship.More exhibits have opened in the ship. Things like officer bunks, crew living spaces, mess deck, kitchen, etc. It sure would have been nice to have a tour guy in some of these rooms to talk about what's up.The free download for your phone was just OK. It worked most of the time and gave you some information. Still would have been better to talk to a real person.Overall a very good trip. Shop on-line for tickets. They often have discount tickets (a few dollars off, buy one get one free, etc.). I'll come back again in a year or so. Always having friends in town that want to see a battleship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalGuy101

50,Iowa Visit,Very interesting. Docents were knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Great self guided tour. Ticket booth was very helpful in assisting us find our tickets in their email. Ship is well maintained.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opsedward
50,Thank You 2018,Thank you for all the efforts to save the ship from the mothball fleet in Suisun Bay and the continued efforts to maintain the ship for the public to see it. This was my second visit to the ship and the docents were very knowledgeable and helpful on sharing information of the history of the ship. It is amazing to think how 2700 sailors could all work together on this ship (and quickly go up & down those steps!). My curiosity yearns for more access to more areas of the ship. I will be visiting again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cokertf1

Wonderful, wonderful attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sakaville

50,LA Gem,"I recently visited the USS Iowa with my 12-year old son. We took the basic, self-guided tour and spent a little over two hours walking through the battleship. Both my son and I found the ship very interesting. A highlight was meeting two WWII U.S. Navy veterans who showed us pictures and told stories of their time on battleships like the USS Iowa. We highly recommend visiting this battleship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Henry336400
50,Battleship USS Iowa,It's an exciting experience to see this giant battleship with tons of history. This ship is well kept through the efforts of the volunteers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edgerdog

Also had a cute game for little kids to play which my daughter enjoyed finding clues for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidrebecca08
50,A must see,"As a naval history buff and a resident of Iowa this is always a must-see for me. I get in for free for the unguided tour being a resident of Iowa but I would be more than happy to pay admittance to get in. This past weekend I took the guided tour called the Full Steam tour, it's only done on weekends and it's not cheap for the average person, $49.95, but I would be happy to have paid more for this tour. If you're not capable of climbing stairs and crawling through bulkheads with limited overhead clearance, it might not be for you but if you can do that it's a must do in my opinion. The two gentlemen that guided the tour were very knowledgeable, very friendly and made the tour very enjoyable.And if you take the tour, don't miss the gift shop on the on the way out, plenty of stuff that's priced reasonably and very cool. Rest assured the next time I'm in Long Beach I will be doing it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STEVENN300
50,"Well-run, lots to see","There are plenty of people around to answer questions and provide information. The experience is great to learn about things specific to the battleship and to have lots of great photo opportunities. You can rush through or take at least a few hours to read the signs and take everything in.I would have bought the local ""passport"" option if I had known about it, but I had already gone to most of the San Pedro attractions lumped into the offer. As it is, you can find deals online; I think I got one from Goldstar.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJKFETP
40,Battleship history,Interesting and educational. We did the self guided tour and they do a good job of directing you with arrows on the floor of the ship so that you see it all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/943tb
50,Fascinating & Very Educational,"We absolutely loved our trip here. It's amazing how well this battleship has been restored.There are places where you can sit down and watch short documentaries about the ship's history, and there is plentiful information to read next to almost every artefact.Me and my boyfriend truly loved it. Such a unique experience & really gives you an appreciation of how hard it must have been to keep the ship operational.My boyfriend is a mechanical engineer, and was thrilled with how much detail the tour had about the operational mechanisms of the tactical weapons.It would have been such a shame to leave this ship to ruin. What a fantastic job the community has done.Please be advised that this tour is not wheelchair accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katiesirett
40,Piece of history,This was on my friend's list of things to see but I enjoyed it as well. They did an excellent job of restoring the ship and it was wonderful to see that it didn't just rot away. We have been on many battleships and other ships and this one was organized better than the others. The self guided tour was easy to follow so that you were able to get a good sense of the ship and the many men who manned her. Definitely recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swtraveler15
40,History afloat,"We arrived before they opened and were able to take it the Iowa from the dock from several vantage points. We bought our tickets online, so the check in process was painless. We skipped through photo op and went on board.We tried using their app without success. The volunteers on hand did a great job answering questions and relating facts and tidbits about life on board. Kudos to the volunteers as they made our tour!!!This is great for all ages. There are steps and some steep ladders to go up and down. Wear comfortable walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socforward
40,Great self-guided tour of amazing warship,"I kept on saying to myself: I cant believe it. From the size, weight and throw-distance of the shells to the small cramped quarters. Helpful volunteers man key locations along the way and are full of vignettes and factoids making it all the more interesting. If you're a vet or have one in the family, make sure to visit. If you have kids learning about WWII and Korea, make sure to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineaG1751FG
50,WWII Vets are treated to special ceremony,"Warships of yesteryear are fascinating, and we'd seen this one several times when we left on Princess Cruises out of San Pedro. We made it part of our itinerary on our most recent trip and brought along my grandfather, a WWII veteran.Little did we know there is a special ceremony for veterans. Most veterans are announced ship-wide over the pa system. For WWII vets, they perform a special ceremony with sideboys lining the gangway, make a special announcement over the PA talking about all the action, rank, and everything associated with the veteran. My grandpa was quite happy to take part in the ceremony.We loved the self tour of the ship, but it can be a little challenging for those with limited mobility as there are a lot of up and down ladder climbing that are quite steep in some places. You get to visit many areas of the ship, including the bridge, captain's quarters, and mess hall.My favorite part of the trip was listening to my grandpa recount stories from WWII, which is not something he opens up about much.My daughter and I also took part in the simulator at the end of the tour for a little extra money. It was fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/787toddt

50,Sailing in History,"What an experience to board the lead ship in the most powerful class of battleship our nation has ever built. All 890 feet is impressive. Whether going along topside or going down below, visitors get a real sense of what it is like living aboard a battleship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitebread67
50,Inspiring,"Located in LA harbor this battleship is a part of history not to be missed. It is an excellent tour at a reasonable price. Overall, it is a beautiful ship with many missile launchers, grand artillary, captains quarters, and beautiful views from the ship. We walked around all the accessible areas of the ship including various rooms and saw many guns and missile launchers. Many of the displays were informative and provided a history of the ship. The volunteers located along the route of the tour are extremely helpful and in many cases speak from first-hand experience. To be on a battleship that fought for our country so many times and still looks powerful is amazing. Touring the ship kept our interest the whole time. Enjoy your visit, and keep in mind what you pay in admission is going toward to improving and maintaining the ship for the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/e_Williams191
50,Impressive self guided tour of WWII Battleship,"This battleship was one of four “Iowa” class battleships that saw action in WWII, Korean and Cold Wars. While you don’t go below the waterline, you get to experience FDR’s stateroom, command center, bridge, mess halls, sailors quarters, turrets and more. There is a great app you can download to give you more information and interesting facts about what you’re seeing on your self guided tour. The docents are amazing. So much information and stories to tell. Ask questions/act interested and they will share but if you want to be left alone, they do that as well. We spent about 1 1/2 hours touring. We went on a Tuesday morning at 10:30 and felt like we were alone on the ship most of the time. There were a couple of school groups but they didn’t cause any concern. The ship is open every day (except Thanksgiving and Christmas) from 10 to 5 pm with the last admission at 4 pm. Due to the financial support the museum receives from the State of Iowa, we got in free. A nice perk but we still feel it’s worth the admission and the contribution to preserving history (we gave a donation in lieu of our free admission). Adults (12-61) $19.95/$17.95 online, children 6 to 11: $11.95/$9.95 online, seniors 62+: $16.95/$14.95 online. Under five are free but still require a ticket. Parking is $2 for the first 1 hour 59 minutes, then $2 an hour after that. There are ladders that go up and down as well as the need to step over 8 inch door heights. I found on the steep downhill ladders that if I just turned around and went down backwards it was easier for me. Our 6’3” son had to watch his head from time to time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IowaTravelFan
40,Interesting Stay!,"My husband and I participated in a sleepover event on the Iowa during Veteran's Day weekend. Very unique experience. Interesting and fun, but also very uncomfortable. We were grateful to have experienced what life aboard a battleship is/was like, but were also very grateful for our spacious bedroom and soft bed when we went home!As far just visiting the ship itself, I found it really fascinating. It's a great opportunity to get an up close and in depth look at these engineering beasts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
20,Impressive but beware of closures for special events,"My son and I travelled to the Iowa during a recent visit to LA, hoping to spend a few hours on the ship. When we arrived at lunchtime they were about to close the ship to visitors ready for a special event that afternoon - we and a couple from Florida pleaded to be allowed onboard as we were all visitors from some distance away. It was a firm no and then as I walked away the Florida couple were allowed on! I was really not impressed with this but didn't see any point in arguing with the staff at the entry booth.As an alternative we visited the nearby LA Maritime Museum...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Corb2000
50,USS IOWA an excellent museum for WW2 buffs.,"The USS IOWA is an excellent WW2 museum for nautical buffs. Large parts of it are open to the public which gives a real insight to its workings.

Well worth it if you can do that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailing_Sweetie
50,A walk through history,"I truly enjoyed my self-guided tour through the battleship. It was interesting finding out about life aboard and the tragedy that occurred in 1989. This ship has a rich military history and was supposed to be the ship on which the surrender of Japan was signed, but the USS Missouri won out because Harry Truman was from there. There are a lot of stairs to climb, so put on some good shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joelg710
50,Great part of our country's history,"The USS Iowa was involved in so much of our country's Naval history. My father and I toured the Iowa during some down time waiting for a red-eye flight. I'm so glad we did. It's a self-guided tour by following the yellow arrows on the deck. There are numerous staff wandering around the ship with great information and background on the history of the ship. The tour is well set up and has the option of using an app to tell you things as you make your way through. We took our time and rested on the deck overlooking the water. It was a great experience, so glad we did this!! Also, you can save a couple of dollars per person by buying the tickets online, ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BallDawg

50,Living History!,"My 11 year-old son and I visited the USS Iowa recently and had a wonderful experience. You don't get to go below decks, but you have extensive access to everything else, including the battle bridge where the fleet admiral stood in WW II, and FDR's personal stateroom custom-fitted for his needs. There's a great gift shop to top it off.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcsalcedo1966
50,Awesome tour,"Nice n awesome family experience, very informative, fully self guided experience....fun filled 3 hrs tour,we enjoyed fully",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJBlr
50,USS Iowa Visit,The staff couldn't have been more accommodating and friendly. The self guided tour on our iphones was so easy and amazing! We had an Army Veteran with us and he was treated with great respect. The 18 year old with us is a WWII enthusiast and was totally impressed with everything.Thank you!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L9153AOlindad
50,A Marvel!,It's amazing the magnitude of how big this ship is and the engineering behind it for it's time. Definitely worth the experience!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nass673
40,Christmas Boat Parade,We took our 4 grandchildren to the Iowa to watch the Christmas boat parade in San Pedro. Wonderful venue although more chairs and access to more of the harborside of the ship would have allowed the large crowd to have more comfort and better sight lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jelennertz
50,An Impactful Day,"We went to the Iowa in celebration of my dad's 95th birthday...he didn't serve on it, he helped build it in the Brooklyn Navy Yard many years ago. Surrounded by his children and grandchildren, he climbed throughout the many levels of the ship with our amazing and knowledgeable guide. Beyond being informative, education and inspiring it did something near impossible--he said it ""made him feel young again"". Bring your family. Learn how this ship contributed to transporting, battles and peace. And hope that we never have to go to war again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9132NPmiket
50,WONDERFUL,I took my husband for his birthday & we had a fantastic day. We took the tour of the engine room and he has so much fun that he is considering becoming a voulnteer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnmshydlb
50,AMazing for kids and adults,"Took both my boys (ages 10 and 12) and they both had an amazing time as did I. You can spend as little as an hour but we took our time and spent 3 hrs. They have an amazing app for the phone that you can listen to while you walk the ship and it is free. We bought the membership and visited the victory too on the same day, which is only 1 mile away from this ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538efratl

40,Pre cruise visit,Aside from the fact that the ladders were somewhat steep for the lady we were traveling with it was a very interesting tour. It felt very special to be on a vessel that was such a part of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mike_smith8651
50,Family visit,"It was a great experience, educational and interesting. It was obvious how much the people who work there love their job.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aliciagL1993RA
30,Good place for our 8 yr old grandsons,"Our grandsons liked the scavenger hunt, or finding Vicky. They have been to the USS Midway and liked it better only because there were more knobs and dials to work with. More touchable stuff would have been better. Loved the fact that there were not that many people on board, so you could take your time and really look at the guns and absorb the importance of this wartime vessel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/billsJ5193GB
50,Full Steam Ahead Tour,"Excellent tour taking you to the aiming system for the big guns and into the engineering compartments of the ship. The tour ended in the Combat Engagement Center. Docent was a wealth of information and said that ""he likes to hear himself talk"". It was a great and informative tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kprebble

50,Awesome,"The tour was spectacular, my three young children really enjoyed it. It was also very educational for them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/417mitchellh
50,Time for the Big Guns!,"If you like WWll and naval history this is a must see. There are four Iowa class battleships and this one has some amazing history. The docents do a fantastic job giving you so much of the Iowas past. This is a great place for families, and folks of all ages. I've been twice and still want to go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pans4au
50,Educational,"The ship has a long history extending back to World War II. The self guided tour does a great job showing you the ship and teaching you about the history of the ship, it’s crew, and US naval history in general. The volunteers are knowledgeable and friendly and include navy veterans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardmZ5048WX
50,The beauty and power was overwhelming. Understanding the historical underpinnings of this Battleship class of ship.,The Power & Aesthetics of this Battleship and its class is a source of pride for all Americans and an eye-opening experience for anyone else,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCRoumell
50,Perfect for the family,"We have visited the Iowa three times. Every time we go, we see something new. Highly recommend it for the entire family. It is a great piece of American history and tribute to our soldiers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slbake
50,Great day!!,Staff were friendly and helpful. Ship was not overly large and well mapped out for tour on your own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3242XClorig
50,A trip through History,"The tour of the Battleship Iowa was amazing. We had a blast and got our workout in climbing all over the ship. We appreciate the history and the blood, sweat, and tears shed on its decks. I would highly recommend this to everyone!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shadowmeboy
40,Very Good,"If you are a history buff and like WWII, this is a must. Great for children to get an idea of what life was like on a destroyer. Very enlightening and self guided.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peepye
50,Never gets boring.,"This is probably the sixth time I've toured this floating museum and amazing piece of wartime naval history, and it never gets old. It was my girlfriend's first time on the tour, and she too was blown away (bad pun intended). The meetup with WWII veteran Dr. Howard Rogers (Electronics Technician 2nd Class, 1944-46) was especially worthwhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrojanSkyCop1
40,A excellent attraction,"We drove down from LA to visit the USS Iowa and glad we did. It is a self paced tour, which gives you a great insight to the living conditions but also the power the ship had when it was operational. There is parking available for a small fee, and it took us about one and half hours to look around the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VirginiaM305
50,Great Tour,Very interesting self conducted tour of a great piece of US naval history. The ship has been lovingly restored and the attention to detail is spectacular.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potsUk
50,Ship Ahoy!,"Fantastic visit and different everytime we go. I have been here 3 times in the last 5 years and it is fun and informative. Relatives, especially my older generations enjoy and can remember back to the times that took place on this ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulesinRHE
50,Never knew this was here! Great for families and historians,"Historic huge battleship in Los Angeles Harbor. Still in the process of being renovated, but you can tour the decks, some of the guns, and inside. The ship was decked out just as it was when decomissioned in the 1980's, with cruise missile launchers and Gatling guns. The kids can do a scavenger hunt. Learn about President Roosevelt's trip to the Yalta Conference and other historic events the ship was involved. Easy to get to at the end of the 710 Freeway and you can save money if you combine your ticket with the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Recommended for families with older kids, veterans, or any history buffs. Don't believe the reviews that say that 1.5 hours is enough, we stayed 3 hours, but could have stayed longer. There is an app you can download with explanations of the ship and historic events. I highly recommend you install it and use it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/814ianb
50,A true gem,"Wow, it’s only as you walk towards this epic battleship do you truly appreciate the authority and presence of this extraordinary vessel. I love ships, that I declare, but this says everything about American maritime expertise. Everything about the ship is impressive. Everyone will be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon-in-Civic
40,Good stop before cruise.,Had a cruise leaving at 4 next door. Stopped and dropped bags around 10 with cruise ship and walked to the Iowa. Cool self guided tour. Appreciate what our service people do and did. Hard to fathom life on board. Show cruise ship docs and get half price admission.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Paulinparker
50,We spent the night,"We booked a tour and overnight for our scout troop and it was amazing! Our tour was after dark, once the museum closed. We were guided through the entire ship, stopping at several locations. We were fed in the mess hall (galley is the correct verbiage I think.) and got to sleep in the bunks. As an adult I spent a lot of time imagining what it must have been like as a sailor serving during the war. My grandfather served in both WW1 and 2 on a sub. My father, on a carrier during the Korean conflict. I thought of them as we made our way through the barber shop, the mess hall and the outside decks. This battleship is extra special because it carried President Roosevelt to meetings with Churchill and Stalin. If you have the opportunity to either visit for a traditional daytime tour or an overnight, this is well worth the time. The guides are amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeganE233
50,Great time,"I was there with my 12 year old son and we really enjoyed. It is a self guided tour throughout the battleship with lots of self explanatory things to see. Maybe not so interesting for women and girls, but for men definitely a recommendation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreas100088
50,Puts you in the history of our nations wars,"Lots of access to many places on board and you don't really grasp the enormity of the ship until you are on board. Tough though for anyone who can't walk a lot, climb steep stairs (aka: ladders) and get around in tight spaces. Plan on a long visit. Plenty of places to eat in nearby San Pedro. Lots of parking. Think about going to the liberty ship as well right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z7011UDmichaelp
40,Gets better each trip,"Think of this as a living battleship, that allows one to experience history. I've been with a veteran and slept on board the boat with a cub scout troop having breakfast on deck the following morning. The trip is a moving one depending on your company. No book or film can adequately enable one to feel what being on board a battleship is like. You have to experience it for yourself.Wear comfy shoes with non slip soles as you will be doing some walking. If you've dodgy knees take your time as there are some steps to climb up and down but you also can choose what you want to see.I recommend it for families and if you can swing a night sleeping on board you will have a hoot. The boat is different each time as it's in a constant state of renovation. Get to see the engine room if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsG3005BB
40,Interesting.,We enjoyed visiting this battleship and learning its rich history from wonderful volunteers. The ship is in great shape with great memorabilia. We spent a couple of hours exploring the lower and upper decks. I highly recommend touring this historic ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolynw37
50,Interesting look back at history,A very interesting self-guided tour exploring one of the U.S. famous battleships. In addition to several short videos there are numerous photos and stories of those who served on the ship. There are a lot of stairs so limited mobility might be an issue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TwoRetiredFolk
40,Visit Before Cruise,"My 7 year old son was super excited to visit the Iowa, in between our visit to Disneyland and boarding a cruise. We dropped our luggage at the cruise terminal then a quick 5 minute walk to the Iowa. With my wife and 4 year old daughter, we all really enjoyed the Iowa and each liked it for different reasons. I felt the tour was very well done, as you get to explore a lot of the ship on your own time. A few more stories or poster boards might enhance the visit, but at the same time, the time my son got to spend asking questions and listening to the ex-sailor (sorry, I'm not sure what his official title would be) was incredible. This sailor took the time to answer all the questions and tell stories, and in a way that the kids really appreciated.By far the best part, at least for the kids and parents, was the hunt for VICKY, the ships dog! All around the ship there are posters of Vicky that the kids could hunt for, and were rewarded with a small but rewarding gift at the end. I can't remember what the gift was but I sure remember how excited they were every time the found a new Vicky. I think we ended up staying on the ship about 1.5 hours, though I imagine you could spend a lot more time if you wished.Once we were done we walked back to the cruise terminal, checked in, and once on board, got to see an amazing view of the Iowa from our cabin.A real treat and we are very appreciative of all the work and effort everyone is doing to restore such an amazing ship! Thank you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnaA659KI
50,Amazing restoration of an American Icon,"If you like WW2 history, or ships, you will love visiting the USS Iowa. You can visit many parts of the ship with a basic entrance fee - lots of interesting things to look at and shorts films to watch. We spent about 90 minutes and were moving pretty fast. The volunteers are helpful and courteous. Wish I would've had time for the engine room tour. If you love history, this is a must-see attraction when in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/litedee
50,A must for the History,This is like a spiritual trip for history buffs. The ship is huge and you cant tell that till your crawling through it. It is confronting to see how sailors lived on the floating fortress. The kids loved the history and I got a kick out of it too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steve151070
50,"Great ship, good tour.","I went on the Full Steam Ahead tour. The tour takes about 2 hours. You go below decks and see places not part of the regular self guided tour. Engine room, CIC, sick bay. The guide was very knowledgeable and answered lots of my questions in great detail. I went on the self guided tour afterward.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/das702017
50,Awesome,Awesome tour of the USS Iowa. Great piece of history. Just amazing what our sailors went through to protect us. Did not get to see as much of ship as I’d liked as we visited during the week. Call or book ahead to get a more in depth tour. Definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeE1965
50,Great piece of history!,"USS Iowa is such an important piece of world history, it was a privilege to walk on the decks of a Battleship so steeped in tradition and history and played such an important role in multiple conflicts. It was fascinating to learn more of the history of the ship and speak with the knowledgeable ‘crew’. I also think the piping on board of servicemen and women was a very nice touch. No to mention it was just great to see some big guns!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cannonedale
50,Great time with my father who is a World War 2 vet.,My father who is a World War 2 vet enjoyed visiting the Iowa ship. We were able to talk about the war and his remembrance of that era in time. We spent 5 quality hours on the Iowa ship exploring and bonding. Thank you so much for allowing us to do that. The time was priceless.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mayaispuro
40,Battleship USS Iowa,I took my son and his friend to visit the battleship a month ago and they really enjoyed it. But both are also very interested in military history. The curators are knowledgeable and eager to share special stories related to the ship (no spoilers here). The parking is easy and navigating your way through is pretty intuitive. If you are fan of history you'll enjoy this special attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EMMc34
30,It is a battleship with a super boring tour. Moving on.,"The Battleship USS Iowa is located in San Pedro. The harbor is nice. The area is awful and I did not feel safe as soon as the sun began to set.I took my grandson to see the ship. It was expensive and parking was outrageous. They have a tour you take and they do have some interesting information about the ship, but for the most part the tour guide seemed so bored and could not answer questions.Go somewhere else. Really.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
40,Worth visiting,Great place to visit.Very interesting.The kids enjoyed every moment.Congratulations for everything!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maurokm
50,Back again,6 years since I was here last and there is must more to see around even it is not finish. The entrance fee is the same so it is good and here is never crowed. all in all a nice trip again and good luck to the staff on USS IOWA as the do a great work,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmittag
50,Touch History,"I have seen many WWII war machines and, with the Iowa, I again wonder, ""How did they do it""? Touching and seeing the history of this grand old boat was an incredible history. It isn't until you see the actual machine that you realize just how exposed our sailors were and come to appreciate their honor and bravery. The self-guided tour reveals the essential infrastructure and is a project under continuing development. This is a tour for youngsters and old Vets alike. Just a great glimpse into our past history. Can't recommend it enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smithcharles799
40,Fact and fun filled day,The trip was informative and nice. Would have been better if more areas of the battleship were accessible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ekraams
50,Full steam ahead tour,Excellent tour given by several older veterans. Lots of ladders to climb so you must be somewhat nimble. Many interesting stories about life on the battleship and how all the engines work,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/George1891
40,USD Iowa,"We visited to watch a local event in the area. The battleship is a unique environment with lots of historical significance ranging back to World War II e. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this location for people who like history or military equipment. It is also well located if you are visiting other things along the coastline in the area. It is clearly a work in progress, as are portions of the ship that have yet to be refurbished. But it was enjoyed by everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W4092IFdaveb

50,Great Visit,"I took self-guided tour. The information available is excellent. There are video presentations along the tour. There were some people on hand to answer questions as well at various points in the tour. I enjoyed the experience. To improve the experience, I would suggest opening some areas in lower decks of the ship like engine room and munitions storage areas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tom_helmus
50,Worth a visit,"Always interesting to visit old warships that have been turned into museums, and this is no different. You get a good feel for what life was like aboard these ships as lived by the sailors who served on them. We had a very good visit, and we highly recommend this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dan29942
50,USS Iowa (BB-61) Floating Museum,"As a former Navy Man (QM2), every time I've visited BB-61, it is a trip down memory lane. The docent/volunteers have done a fantastic job restoring the old battle wagon. The ""Big Stick"" is a glaring reminder of what made our country great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobdollins
50,Great place to visit!,"This battleship is so neat to visit. Its very large and takes at least an hour or so to walk through and check out everything. There were veterans along the way to talk to who worked on the ship when it was active, so it was interesting to get first hand stories. A must see for any war buff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurafG9574FW
50,Self guided tour of USS Iowa,"The experience was great and my 11 year old grandson really enjoyed the ship, even though he was not educated on the Navy, let alone the military. I would visit other Navy Ships and Aircraft that have some significance to our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/br4notax
50,Keith Waldie's Review.,"Well done.No complaints.Extremely interesting, customer oriented and very friendly.Keep up the good work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keithwaldie
40,Great for kids over 5 years old and history buffs!,"We had a group of 6 adults & 3 boys over 5 y.o. We all found many things to enjoy and the volunteer guides are great. Recommend you use the app to buy your tickets and skip the line (easy/fast).We started out using the self-guided audio app, but with such a large group - found we wanted to talk about different things and go indifferent directions. All exhibits are well documented, so was easier to read about them as we went. The kids had fun with the scavanger hunt (and kept them busy).Plan on 2+ hours and wear comfortable shoes. You will be climbing up and down very narrow ladder style steps! The ladies in our group had sandles on and we were fine - but if you need assitance pulling yourself up a steep ladder - you may want to pass on this attraction. NO WAY can you use a stroller or wheelchair and enjoy all the sights.Highly recommend as a family event with the above warnings (Kids >4 or 5 y.o., no strollers, no walkers, no wheelchairs, no high-heels, extremely overweight, etc.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel_Girl19572013
50,Historical Battleship,"This attraction is a self-paced tour of a WW II battleship which saw service in conflicts after the World War. There are guided tours available if you wish but the self guide tour has knowledgeable personnel stationed along the self tour to answer question. The displays and videos along the tour are informative. If a veteran, your visit will be announced over the P.A. was you are on tour. The admission is reasonable, parking is extra depending on length of stay.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LtColD
50,Very fun,Its very fun for those who have not gone on board one of these gaint beast of the seas . you will see how big the rounds that can be shot from there a distance of 21 miles . If your really lucky on Cruise ship day you will see just how big those cruise ships are .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ruhs1969
50,"Battleship Iowa docked in San Pedro, CA",Brought my dad (he’s 80) on a tour as a surprise. He’s a former Navy guy and had an amazing time! I liked it too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suebS6373NB
50,Battleship Bonanza.,Very reasonably priced self tour that allowed access to much of the ship. Displays and stewards on-board were very informative.We spent 3 hours on-board and it could have been longer except we were getting hungry!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsgale66
50,Wonderful to experience this great piece of American history,I had a wonderful time touring this ship. It is a great value for the money. The staff could not have been nicer and the tour was really interesting. It is fascinating to walk though this ship that served our country so long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jasmurorl
50,The Greatest most well-rounded battlship,"The Iowa class were built for both escorting and firepower to counter all others. They accomplished both jobs excellently, and lasted till the late 1980s. They are the pride and soul of American-born naval lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/midwaymagicc
50,"A museum that makes you go ""WOW""","There's not many museums out there that give you a ""WOW"" factor like the Iowa. The ability to walk around the ship, touch the foot+ thick steel, and look all around you and see an amazing and powerful weapon built do defend America and her interests - it's a great experience for kids and adults alike.The kids will mostly enjoy just walking about and taking in the size and power of the ship, and more mature audiences will enjoy the wealth of information provided about the ship, her combat capabilities, and significant historical events that she was part of.The staff were kind, and even without asking anything they approached my younger brother and I with a smile and explained the significance of her tasks, what made her special, and why she was important throughout the wars she participated in.The exhibits usually consist of information plaques around significant places of the ship, such as the bridge citadel, turrets, secondary armaments, missile launchers, etc. There are several informative videos along the way explaining in detail the mechanical functions of the ship (such as how the guns are loaded and fired).If you walk through and look at everything in detail, expect a 1-2 hour experience. If you watch the videos and read all the plaques, you're probably looking at a 4 hour experience at most.It's worth noting a fair amount of the ship is outdoors, so choosing good weather might be in your interest.It's certainly a museum worth visiting, it's one of only 4 Iowa-class battleships, and not many people alive can claim to have walked upon a vessel as powerful as she is!The ladders take some getting used to, so be cautious with them around kids. When going down, have the adult go down first and the kid follow behind. When going up, have the kid go up first and you behind. Face the ladder and use the handlebars/cables! They're pretty steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanlaruethomas
50,Awesome family excursion!,"My 11 year-old daughter has been wanting to go. So we went when my sister visited with her family. Went also with a 3 and 5 year-old. There was something for everybody, very fun. A wonderful piece of history that every American should visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrGlobetrottingMama
40,Iowa Review,Had a great time visiting the Iowa Battleship. The Room were very clean and organize. The Staff there were nice and friendly. I liked looking at the Front Cannons in the front of the ship. I disliked the museum at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielsD7619TI
50,Educational and Fascinating,We learned a lot about the history of this ship and how officers and enlisted sailors lived. Since this was a flagship we saw the admiral's as well as President Wilson's quarters (a bathtub was installed for him). It was a real treat to have veterans of the ship (in their nineties) present to talk to in the officers' mess hall. We spent a good three hours there; it was great to go at our own pace. If you have a disability the steep stairs may be a problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/549maryannw
50,USS Iowa BB-61 is History at its Finest!,"Visiting the USS Iowa on Veterans Day (11/11/2017) was a very exciting and fun experience. My wife and I decided to attend the festivities held at the Iowa’s dock and then spend the rest of the day doing the self-guided tour. Just seeing the immense outline of the Battleship as we approached pier was just as humbling as when we visited the Iowa’s sister ship the USS Missouri, BB-63 and the USS Arizona Memorial in Honolulu, Hawaii years earlier. We purchased our tour pass online and printed out our boarding pass before heading to the USS Iowa, which saved us time waiting in a long-long-line of people who were trying to purchase their boarding pass. I highly recommend you purchased your boarding pass before visiting the Iowa, it also saves you a few buck per pass.Seeing the Gadsden flag as the First Navy Jack waving on the bow of the USS Iowa is visually interesting and prideful. Since 9/11/2001, the Gadsden flag – Navy Jack has flown on the bow of every active and selected decommissioned US Naval Warships.The self-guided tour is about 2 hours long. Each section of the ship you pass through is well documented and visually interesting. You can almost feel the presence of those sailors and officers who manned the USS Iowa in past years. Although the USS Iowa last configuration was with modern weapons, the sheer size of the 16” and 5” turrets and displayed shells still on board is awesome. Walking through the crew and officer quarters, armory, and galley, and the command control deck is fascinating.When we last visited the USS Missouri in Honolulu, Hawaii, we did the VIP tour, which is over 4 hours long. It takes you to areas of the ship that the self-guided tour does not. The next time we visit the USS Iowa, we plan on doing the VIP tour.We highly encourage everyone to pass the word to all of your relatives and friends to visit the USS Iowa. It is a testament to the quality and strength of what the United States ship building industry is, and the strength of United States Navy protecting our Great Nation. To think, that the USS Iowa and the USS Missouri sailed into Tokyo Bay and presented the symbol of power of the United States when WWII ended with the Japanese formal capitulation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rval_2004
50,Battleship USS Iowa BB-61,We took the engine room and below decks tour and was well worth the time and price. Excellent tour guides and volunteers that are very knowledgeable about the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bkryeng
50,A must see,I have to say must see the employees they help out a lot they where closing the ship down early due to concert and let me an other group in as we all both from out of town and would not be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ramonn434
50,awesome experience!,our family had a such a great time exploring this WW2-era battleship... even my 9-year old daughter who had no prior interest started watching youtube videos about these might ships after the tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tipoytm
30,Great experience but the App did not work,Been wanting to see the USS Iowa with my son who is 8 for a couple years now and finally made the drive to do so. The ship itself is well worth the drive and the entry fee but I was disappointed that the App for the tour did not work. I even asked one of the staff for help and he could not figure out why it wasn't working. I had a friend tell me the App didn't work when he went either. Still great to be walking around on and through a battleship but I can only feel that a lot of information was missed due to the App not working. The purchase of food would have been nice too since it is remote with no food establishments around. We arrived at 1:00 due to traffic and completed the walk thru by 3:00 and we were hungry.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokablly01
50,Fantastic Museum Ship,My friend and I visited the ship during the Veterans Day event. The ship is being fully restored beautifully. What a fantastic tour!

50,A historically important vessel within reach!,"I managed to surprise my husband, a naval/history buff, with a visit to the Battleship USS Iowa. I also love history so both of us were in awe of the detail of restoration, the displays and videos that highlighted the various parts of the long history of the USS Iowa.

50,Excellent & beautifully retored,"This is a must-see; it's definitely worth braving the LA traffic to enjoy this wonderful museum. The ship has been rescued from deterioration, restored and staffed by volunteers. The exhibits inside the ship are well put together and modern, and the staffers are very friendly, helpful and knowledgable. The ship was especially interesting to me as I've also seen the USS Missouri, one of her four sisters.As a bonus, you will get to see the container ships arriving at Terminal Island in the Port of Los Angeles, right across the channel from the USS Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cellomerl

Fascinating and moving!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterJayR
40,Great experience for those interested in naval defence history,"This battleship has a lot of history and is well worth a visit for defence history buffs. Be aware however, it is not suitable for people with walking difficulties and definitely not wheelchair accessible.The volunteers are very knowledgeable and helpful. Some areas are accessible for you to gain an understanding of the way of life aboard the ship, however many of the areas are only accessible by looking into a room",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wynlyn
50,See it!,"It's easy to get to and the parking is cheap.It's an important part of our history that should not be missed!Interestingly, right next door is a cruise terminal. Compare the cruise ships to this largest-ever battleship and it looks puny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fcfrag
50,A very educational experience,This piece of history let's you experience history as the sailors did back in the day. You visit the galley and the officers quarters as well as the crews quarters. You learn all about the battles and loss of crew members. You visit many of the deck compartments and the Bridge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikemJ9687YB
50,great thing to do,"Had a great time visiting the Iowa, found it very interesting and very user friendly even my wife enjoyed it. The guys on the ship were very helpful and friendly even the gift shop was good. Love the way the volunteers take a huge pride in her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ayrshireboy2604
50,Great tour of history.,My husband has a bucket list to visit all the battleships and carriers. He was in the navy for a few years back in the '60s. When we boarded they asked they asked about us and when they found out he had been in the navy they welcomed him aboard by announcing his service. In all our tours this is the only ship to do this. It meant so much to him. They have worked hard to preserve this ship. Fascinating experience that even I enjoyed. When you are in the LA area I suggest you take time to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/726pamd
50,"Really excellent, even my wife enjoyed it! It’s a must visit attraction in LA.","We spent 2 hours exploring the ship and listening to the fascinating docents tell stories about the ship and its deployment - its really important historically and it comes alive through these stories. Guys are expected to enjoy battleships and I did, but my wife also loved it much to my surprise. Parking was only $2 and no line on a saturday either. Would also be excellent with children as long as they can handle steep stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angmohs
50,USS Iowa tour,Thought the tour was great. First time my husband and I where on an U.S. battleship. The tour helped both of us understand what the sailors went though during the Second World War.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrendaAnn3
50,Everything you thought and more,We went there a couple of months back and the tour starts with a video of the history of the USS Iowa. The pace continues and it is nice to be able to tour on your own and at your own pace. We are looking forward to going again and seeing things that we may have missed this time. It is a great opportunity to learn and experience history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forevercars2014
50,Blast from the Past,This is a great representation of t a battle ship. It has a great history that you can enjoy on your own self paced tour. We also purchased the combo pack to visit the Queen Mary which made it a great savings. Both of these ships are close to the cruise ship terminals so a small taxi ride makes for a fun day or if you are lucky the USS Iowa will be only a short walk,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB958

40,Tom's Review,"Iowa offers a great experience and the self guiding tour lets you move at your own pace to adsorb the atmosphere around. The only note I have is that it would be nice if there were more guides around the various exhibits to help you understand their importance to the ship. While the app does offer great information, computers can't answer your questions the way a human can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tzarnoch
50,Great Experience,We love the history of the ship.we love the volunteer retired soldiers attitude. we really respect what they did and what they are doing for our country.We also appreciate that we have the chance to see this navy ship and understand more about our country.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonychun2017

40,Self guided tour with plenty of explanation plaques and people.,"We loved this tour on the ship. We could see and do everything on our own pace. The ship has lots of steep stairs and is therefor not so suitable for people with an mobility handicap like me...but I managed because we could make our own tempo and there were plenty of opportunities to sit and rest. We really enjoyed the very personal photo's an senior navy men showed us. He had great stories to tell ! The shop had nice items for everyone, from kid to collector. We missed some possibilities to sit and eat or drink some soda. The parkingprice was reasonable here as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dutchkathy

I just bought him a hat with ""scrambled eggs"" on it. He lives is Pennsylvania and will not be able to come to Calif. to actually visit this magnificent ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R6300QVvirginial
50,Fun For All Ages,"Visiting the Battleship USS Iowa was both an exciting and educational experience. The tour guides were helpful and friendly and made the visit unforgettable. I would go back and tour again since the ship is so big, I don't feel like you can take it all in during one visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/608antonyp

50,Battleship USS Iowa,"Recommend a tour as all of the docents are extremely knowledgeable on the history of the ship, and the worlds political situation during battle and peace time. My father was a 1st class radioman on the hornet during WW2 and after the tour was over, the docent took us to the radio room which was NOT part of the tour and we got to speak to another person who was working to restore some of the equipment. The tour was fabulous!!! We are planning to go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedondoBeachers
50,Great Ship,I had wanted to see the Battleship for some time but had trouble convincing the family that it would be fun. I went on my own over the long weekend and was glad that I did. The people that take care of it do an excellent job keeping her up. I even found a charging spot for my Chevy Volt within easy walking distance of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richard_florin
40,Fun for the entire family,Really interesting tour. We appreciated the fact there was a scavenger hunt throughout the ship that motivated the kids. I would highly recommend to anyone in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicpoppa78

40,"August 10, 2017 Visit","I enjoyed the tour very much. There is a wealth of information provided, that is worth seeing. Unfortunately, the tour map provided, the self guided head sets, and the path followed through the ship were not coordinated very well and it was difficult at times to be in the right place. Do not waste your time our money on the flight simulation package available on the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaredner
40,Great history,"We took our three boys to see this wonderful peace of our American history (ages 15, 11, and three). All 3 boys definitely enjoyed climbing in and out of the different gangways and stairwells and nooks and crannies but it was difficult keeping up with the three-year-old to make sure that he didn't go anywhere he wasn't supposed to so maybe not the easiest trip with children under 5. However even with those challenges we thoroughly enjoyed learning about this great piece of History and were amazed and how wonderfully restored and up kept this ship is",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N4941SMamyd
50,Awesome!,Great place to take the kids. I may have actually enjoyed it more than the kids. To stand on a living historical monument that was actually in the service of our great country was awe inspiring!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigtony23
50,WW2 History Buffs Must Do,"I love history, especially WW2. We have been on a number of subs around the country and this was my first battleship. It was included in my Go LA pass, so it was worth the drive out to Long Beach to knock a few of those attractions down.The ship is down by the docks, so it is a bit of madhouse to get down there. But there is plenty of parking, and it is easy to find with the signage. We went on a Saturday, so there were plenty of vets around telling you stories and such.You board the boat and follow a tour from the front to the back, climbing up the different levels all of the way up to the conning tower. There are bits of history along the way with plenty of selfie opportunities should you be so inclined.I find all of this stuff very interesting. There was not as much signage as I have seen on similar kinds of exhibits, but that is not always a bad thing. It was a very interesting tour, and to see it from this perspective considering what I have seen in the movies like ""Under Siege"" or ""Navy Seals"".They did offer an audio tour. This was the first time we had come across one where you download and app and listen as you walk versus them giving you headsets, or having buttons to push along the way. Not necessarily good or bad, just different than other WW2 exhibits.Because of the location, if it were not in my Go LA Pass, I do not know that I would have made the trip out there to see it despite being a History buff. However, since it was included in my pass, that eliminated the excuses for me NOT to go out and take advantage making it a solid value.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
40,WORLD WAR 2 FLOATING HISTORY!,"Being able to view this floating history lesson about World War II was eye opening for me. I wasn't good with history in school, so visiting this Battleship put things into better prospective for me. Knowing that our country stood together, our men and women proudly serving so that we could be safe on our home ground, and giving our President a secure home, even though it was just temporary, gave me an incredible feeling. The USS IOWA is an experience that leaves a person with a lasting impression of how our country united during a horrible time in history. Don't miss this opportunity, as you have all the time you want to look about! Experience the huge cannons on deck and try to imagine what they sounded like. Shop the museum store. I was looking for a patch that was Army/Air Force before they were separated, and the young man in the store took time to look up the symbol and locate a patch that stood for both branches of the service during a time when my mother served as a nurse flying the wounded back from the battlefields. That was GREATLY appreciated, as most Americans don't know these 2 branches were one until after the war. Side note, if you take pictures on-board and purchase them, they tell you that you can download your pictures to view with family at home (supposed to be included with the price of the picture purchase). But they don't tell you that when you download them at home, you still have to purchase the picture/s from them. That's not cool. I have an issue with being misled.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gretchenw641
40,Must see.,An amazing experience and great place to visit. Self pace guided tour and many areas to take pictures. Educational experience and would recommend to all families of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global647820
50,"Amazing Piece of History, A must See Museum Ship!","If you are a military buff, naval buff, or interested in history, this is a must see if you are in the area! Make sure to give yourself a couple of hours to fully enjoy it at least. Amazing how much of the ship you get to see on this self guided tour! Lots of information to read and see about the amazing history of this ships and naval warfare in general. The ship is in great shape but does require some climbing of steep ladders so beware if you have physically issues that prevent you from doing such. Well worth the time and cost of admission. Also located across from the container terminal so it is cool to see the container ships sail by and all the action going on across the channel. Would visit again! 10/10 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradyK177
50,Camp Battleship,"Toured the ship, had dinner, and stayed overnight on the USS IOWA in a sailor's rack, then had breakfast.We went as a group for a Boy Scout troop.This was an amazing and memorable experience especially for the boys. There are very knowledgeable navy veteran volunteers and paid staff who share all they know about this powerful, iconic, American warship.Even if you cannot do an overnighter, take the tour its,well worth it to step onto the deck of history where so many sailors served.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/castle55cr

50,A fantastic piece of history,Missed the USS Iowa the last time we were in Long Beach -- We just did not know that it was there. So we made it a point to go see the USS Iowa this time. What a great attraction -- it is a must to see this great battleship. You ascend a gang plank and are welcomed aboard by a staff member. Once on board you can take as long as you want on a self guided tour (following arrows painted to lead you). There is plenty of helpful staff to answer your questions for you. This piece of history will not disappoint you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterR942
50,"Excellent, better than many nearby attractions","This place is awesome, located at a pier at San Pedro and drive to there is scenic.They were kind enough to let us inside as we reached Little after 4pm , cutoff time for last visitor.The battleship is huge with many decks and you got to see the weaponry, cabins, pantry, galleys and various decks along with rich and proud history of the war this ship had fought.Must visit when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anand1351
40,Really located near Long Beach,This is about 40 mins from LA but worth the trip if you or your kids are interested in seeing a battleship. We were leaving for a cruise from San Pedro so had a chance to visit. Seeing the inside and the close quarters sailors endure is a reality check. And if I recall there is parking because of the cruise lines and the Iowa. If your are lucky you will see one of the cruise ships too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lizznyc
50,Great History Tour!,"I have been here twice once with a friend and once with family. Both times have been a treat. The best part of the tour is speaking to the volunteers that either served on this specific boat or a similar battleship.Take the time and listen to their stories, you will find that the history is amazing and to get it first hand is a once in a life time experience. This isn't a guided tour so feel free to explore, but again, do take the time to chat our veterans up!There is plenty of parking, it is not too expensive, they offer discounts and there are plenty of restaurants and other attractions near by. If you have nothing to do on a weekend afternoon swing by and you might learn something! Even better bring the kids.Don't forget to visit the gift shop, it does have some cool stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bernardom864
50,Great tour!,"This was possibly the best ship tour we've ever been on. First, when they found out we were from IOWA, they did not charge admission - what a great surprise! The tour itself was self guided and they have free wi-fi and a nice little app for your phone that will narrate for you - it was awesome! Would definitely recommend a visit. Super friendly staff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452colleenw
40,Great piece of history,"This was the flagship battleship of its time. The self guided tour follows about 4 different levels of the ship. It was neat to see the captain's quarters and where President Roosevelt stayed on his visit. We were able to talk to one of the Iowa's former crewmembers-that was very informative! Lots of up and down ladders, but not physically overtiring. Definitely something to see when you visit the area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebStr2016
50,Welcoming Staff,I can't say enough about the staff. We felt welcomed as we were greeted walking onto the ship. The self guided tour was easy to follow and the signs were just enough information. We were even given great detail by a US Marine sergeant who explained the story of the US Presidents who had been on the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rileyjr

50,This was a must visit for my Daughter who is a Navy cadet.,"Wow so so big, this was a unreal visit and privilege to be on board this beautiful Ship. My Daughters and son just were over whelmed with the size and what was on board. I also loved the idea of finding Vicky, that was a great game for us to do while exploring this huge ship.

40,"Interesting to walk around, wish we could have seen a bit more","Well worth a trip. No crowds so no queues. Interesting to see some of the living quarters and social side of shipboard life. Would have liked to see more of the engineering spaces and main turrets, gun rooms and magazines.Worth a visit.A lot of the tour is on the upper deck so be prepared for the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyd615
50,California Dreamin',"After hectic days at Disney and Universal our family of four opted for a more sedate daytime trip before going out for Medieval Times that evening. We chose USS Iowa as both the boys are keen on military history and it meant we could venture out to LA Harbour. We are so glad we did. The battleship was fantastic to look around on a self guided tour which took us approximately 3 hours in total. All of the volunteers were informative and helpful and the ship contained some fascinating information, objects and videos to see. The structure itself was brilliant and a fitting testament to the crew who lost their lives in the explosion of turret 2. Walking around following the guide footsteps on deck meant we saw all on offer and the boys enjoyed doing the Lucky Dog Vicky quiz! Great shop to take home some souvenirs at the end and a really informative and fun few hours had by all the family.Fantastic place to visit and well worth any family taking the time to do so. Keep up the good work volunteers!Your friends and allies across from across the pond.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoolyMOK
40,You could feel the winds of war,"Very exciting and good if you have an interest in war and military. The ship is incredibly big and it's great to watch. You get really close to all the equipment and there are plenty of photo opportunities. The parking lot is just the side of the ship and if you're there when they open, you'll get the ship almost to yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Couple_H_A
40,Book online and download app before going,Book online to get a discount on the entrance fee. I regret not downloading the walk through app which im sure wouldve made the tour more informative. A lot of stairs so not for people with physical handicaps. Lots of people and soldiers willing to answer your questions and take selfies with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vanessa51910
40,Cub Scout Troop Tour,Went to see the Iowa when my son was a Cub Scout. The whole troop and many parents went. I went into thinking I would like it about a 4 on a 10 scale. It ended up being about a 7/8 due to some great stories by the guide and just the sheer history of it. I went in 2014 or 2015 I believe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corys638
50,Excellent afternoon activity,This was an excellent afternoon. Learning about the history of the Battleship USS Iowa was very interesting. My dad thoroughly enjoyed it! We were able to buy combination tickets for this and the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific. It was really neat when a veteran or active member of the military would come aboard and would announce them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tink8009
50,A must do,Just came back from Hawaii and this was a place you can't miss doing. There is a lot of history on this ship. It was where the Japanese surrendered to the allies in WWII. If you love history don't miss visiting the mighty MO battleship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianO43
50,A walk with Papa,"Our grandfather was on the Iowa and we never made it here before he passed to walk it with him and connect the dots of his stories. We spent hours here taking it all in and understanding what he meant by the many stories we could remember. Many photos, tears, laughter and most of all a new appreciation for the ship he loved so much!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/audrlynnkey
50,USS Iowa,"We had an exceptional day aboard the Iowa. All the volunteers that help you along the way are extremely knowledgeable of the ship, it's experiences and history. A must for your bucket list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cableladee1
30,My Husband Enjoyed It More,"It's probably just me. As my review title states, my husband and his brother enjoyed it more. I have been to a lot of these military vessels in recent years, and maybe I am just burned out. Plus I never served in the military. Veterans, I'm sure, enjoy their time onboard a lot more. You are greeted as you enter and asked if you served in the military. If you have, they announce your presence, branch of the military, and rank which I thought was very nice. Kudos on this recognition. There is a self guided tour and there are informational signs at each stop. There is also an app that you are encouraged to download. Then at each stop, you will get an audio narration. We had a bit of trouble getting it to work properly so finally gave up about half way through. If you are going to go on other local points of interest like the Queen Mary or the Aquarium of the Pacific, you can buy a ticket for more than one attraction and can save quite a bit. The ticket is good for up to a year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minic00per

40,A ship you need stand on the deck,"Keep in mind this ship was built over 70 years ago. Put yourself in the place of the men who served and lived here during WWII, Korea... Standing next to the armaments one feels small, very small, and fragile standing next to the huge steel turrets, 17+ inches of armor, and on the 800+ ft deck, feeling lost in the small portion of the ship that constitutes the self-guided tour. Then seeing pictures and uniforms in the cabins and racks of those who serve remind one of the very individuals who brought Iowa to life. A sense of reverence was overwhelming me throughout my time aboard. Keep in mind the role she played to keep our country free in dark times, and the cost in lives to maintain the peace. This is not a cruise ship. Modern super tankers and container ships equal her size but not her majesty. Take time near the and of the tour to learn about and to recall the scores of crew lost with the modern era explosion in turret #2. I look forward to more of the ship (lower decks) being opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/251lloydw
50,Impressive,We took our 6 year old grandson to visit the Battleship. We were just as impressed and interested as he was walking through the various parts of the battleship and learning of its history.He asked many questions and we found answers in the displays and from veterans who guided us along the way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S152JYsarat

50,Very cool experience!,"My husband and I took our 14 year old son and his friend on the VIP, curators tour. We all really enjoyed it. The boat staff is amazing at explaining everything and answering questions. We saw so much of the ship and learned so much about it's amazing history. We also did the self guided tour and that also gives you a look at much of the ship. It is worth downloading the app on your phone to listen to the audio tour. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in ships, the military or history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsmithscc
50,Wonderful!,"Great time touring this historic battleship, right near the San Pedro fish market. Interesting and well-informed exhibits and very friendly tour guides. A must-do in the harbor area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/binks79

50,I love the USS Battleship Iowa!,"I have been to the USS Battleship Iowa twice now. The first time was a number of years ago when my son was younger. The ship is awe inspiringly HUGE! In this day and age of technology getting smaller and smaller (computers can now be worn on our wrist!) it is amazing to see this behemoth that once traveled the oceans.As a young boy, my son was so excited to run around and explore all of the cool cubbies and crevices within the ship. The ship also has so much history and provides numerous opportunities for kids to learn about so many things, including science and geography.The second time I went was with my class. I am a teacher and last year, my fellow teachers and I brought our 4th and 5th grade classes to the ship. All the students loved the experience and many still talk about it as their favorite field trip.I totally recommend the Battleship for anyone with kids or for anyone interested in history, science, or learning new things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeanp00l
50,Nice day trip,I was on this ship many years ago and now with the restoration work it is a great way to enjoy the day there are many important things and events that surond the history of our military and country and the time you spend there you will enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natzkem1
30,APP & DOSENS,Couldn't get app tp work properly so almost useless. Adding a GPS map of ship would also help with self touring. Need more personnel explaining what each spot was and how it operated. More on missions of ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/742rogert
50,Impressive historical adventure!,"It is not often where one can walk through time and gain an appreciation of our Navy's power through its history. We took our grandson Nathan this Summer. His dad Stephen served in the Navy and though its been seven years, Nate still longs to see, breath, touch and feel as his dad. Everyone on board was so helpful and caring. The amenities were tops and we enjoyed shopping at the gift shop. Nate especially enjoyed reading about the Iowa while exploring the museum and scavenger hunting for Victory the dog. Thank you, we look forward to a return visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosecha62
50,Great opportunity to teach small Grandchildren about US history.,Both Grandfathers took three grandchildren to the IOWA. I would recommend this to ANYONE that is interested in a teaching opportunity with their family or friends. The crew of the ship was wonderful and their passion infectious. I now have memories with these children that I will cherish and I do think they will also.Thank you for a wonderful experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I690OZanthonyr
50,Fun Time!,"I took my 15 year old grandson to tour the ship, he impressed me with how much knowledge he had about the Iowa, he had never been on the ship before but he did some research on it before he came to visit me, not bad for a 15 year old. I have not been on board since the first week it opened up and I'm glad to see that a lot more of the ship can now be toured. I am hoping that in the future they will have tours that will take you a lot further down into the ship, maybe even to the engine room. All in all the people who are volunteers and paid staff have done a fantastic job with the ship. Loved the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brianmL2159SK
40,Grand Old War Ship,"Enjoyed the walk around the ship. Was a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see inside the big guns or anything below decks like the engine room. However, I realize that they are still working on other areas and I think most folks are volunteers. So, perhaps more in the future. Still, I highly recommend it. Everyone was friendly and helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UtahDancingGuy
50,Excellent tour,"The veterans who facilitated the tour was excellent. The history that they shared with you was amazing. A lot of walking up & down narrow stairs while exploring the ship, make sure to where gym shoes. You will not regret exploring this battleship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roslyn5227
50,Excellent,Mighty ship. The tour guide is extremely knowledgeable. I arrived very late in the afternoon so there were only 40 minutes for me to be on board. I wish I was given a second day admission so I can take my time to see the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pev170
50,History and geography,"We have 6-67 year olds and we all enjoyed the USS Iowa. Staff friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable. Us elders could have stayed around longer, but the young ones didn't want to read everything like us. Great day, I would recommend to all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/622tawnees
50,Family visit with grandkids.,"Excellent experience! Very well organized and the on-ship workers and volunteers were knowledgeable and eager to make the visit fun for the kids. Highly recommend a visit to anyone, young or old!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f_ambrose56
50,"Wonderfully presented, very historic ship.","We visited the USS Iowa as part of a family holiday. I have to admit that I had always wanted to visit, probably as result of playing Top Trumps Warships as a boy and I am a bit of a ship buff. We bought tickets on the day at the ship and the ticket buying experience was fine. On boarding the ship, we were welcomed by a staff member who explained a few things about the tour and the app that we used to get more information.The USS Iowa is a very historic ship with a long service history in most of the 20th Century conflicts. The tour was very easy to follow and there were many excellent exhibits explaining features and life on board. There were also many staff members dotted around who were clearly very passionate about her and happy to chat. We also really enjoyed the announcements for visitors who has served in the US Armed Forces. The Americans do a much better job of recognising the service of veterans than we do in Britain.We felt that our visit was good value for money and we had a really good time. My only regret is not spending more time aboard as we rushed off to visit the RMS Queen Mary which was very disappointing in comparison with the USS Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darren_Brooks
30,Saw this on Harbor Breeze boat tour,It was cool seeing the ship up close and personal. I wish we had time to tour it and see inside. I would definitely take the extra time to look do a tour of the ship. Better luck next time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738shamils
50,Fascinating Historic Battleship,"This is a must see self-guided tour for military buffs, history buffs, bit of Americana and families. Spend a couple of hours here exploring all the nooks and crannies of the SS Iowa. There's lots to read about along the way and there are volunteer military veterans who are enthusiastic founts of knowledge to pick their brains.Buy the souvenir photos and check out the well stocked shop - proceeds help to continue towards refurbishing the great battleship.Note: it may be difficult to climb/descend the narrow stairways for the physically challenged.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidB90744
50,Loved the history!,My husband loves Navy history so we visited this battleship. Unfortunately their app wasn't working; one of the gentlemen working there told us that it was sporadic. The tour is clearly marked with yellow arrows; it is a self-guided tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeriLovesBob
50,"One of the Best, if not the Best","I've been on many Naval Battleships, this experience is fun. Lots of access. I was required to do a guided tour. which I enjoyed. The volunteers are passionate about its rich history.lots of interactive spots which makes this one different from others.nice gift shop with good prices at the end of the tour.so many little fun facts.Parking will cost ya, first half hour is free. not gate person, its a machine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimDeBerry
50,Eighty Two Year Old Veteran - First Time Aboard since 1957,"My father-in-law served on the USS Iowa BB-61 from 1954-1957. At 82, we realized the opportunity to take him across country to see the ship. From the moment we pulled into the parking lot, we knew the day would be special. My father in law, was greeted with extraordinary respect first as a veteran and secondly for having served on this great ship. As he walked onto the ship, they announced him over the loud speaker, welcoming him home. It was an incredibly powerful moment for him and our family. We spent over 4 hours walking throughout the ship - hearing stories that until that day had long been forgotten. As a veteran of the ship, one of the incredibly volunteers, Shane, took us through the ship. He was absolutely fantastic - and the volunteers are just that - giving 100's of hours of time because of their love of this ship's history and for the men and women that served on it. As you would expect with any ship, there are plenty of tight, narrow stairs, but my 82 year old father in law navigated it all like a champ. This was a lifetime highlight for our family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kens
50,A Must See!,"The USS Iowa is impressive even from a distance, you can see her a long way off. The ship tour is reasonably price and is self guided. The tour takes you through a lot of the ship, mostly ""Officer Country"", but you can still get a look at how a sailor life was. The tour gives a lot of the history of the ship from WWII to Desert Storm, although nothing about the No. 1 turret incident? It is great that the ship is finally getting preserved. She is in good but well used shape, most of the teak decking is rotted and being replaced, your walking tour takes place mainly on plywood. It was great that they announce over the load speaker ever active or former military serviceman guest that comes on board. A VERY worth while trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelc178
40,good place to visit,was wonderful for the family and kids as there was alot of rooms to visit. The scarvenger hunt for Vicki was awesome for the kids. It would be nice to have more places to eat or buy snacks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warira
50,A must.,This boat played a huge part in modern history and is greatly preserved. The information given about it is clear and very interesting. I'd say that it's a must if you're in the region.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/770bachirh
50,Unmistakable piece of history worth touring,"The Iowa's history covers decades, from WWII to the desert. This was one of four battleships brought back to service under President Reagan, and was also the ship that ended the battleship's reign on the high seas after a fatal turret explosion brought national attention. If you want to see the ""real deal"", then take the time to visit this impressive vessel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R2500QQmarkd
50,Great for history buffs,"For naval history buffs and kids this is a must-visit, especially if you've never seen a battleship. From the deck one has a good view of container ships being loaded in the Port of Los Angeles. Accessible by car or from the walking trail along the Harbor in the Cabrillo neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fivecontinents5
50,Another reason to be proud to be an American,"If you happen be in L.A. and are on the south side of the city, try to get by to look at the wonderful Battleship Iowa display. It was very reasonably priced and the tour was quite extensive. My grandson received a dogtag that says ""I found Vicki, the Captain's dog"" as a reward to the search for clues on the tour. A nice touch is how they welcome current and former military aboard ship with an announcement over the ship's public address system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/570cliffn
40,Wonderful piece of history... but I couldn't get the app to work!,"Loved the self tour with the arrows and just roaming around the ship and enjoying history at our own pace. The dog tour for the kids to look for was a great idea for getting them involved! We only wish that we could have gotten the app to work on our phone so we could have a ""guide"". A little tip for Iowans - if you let them know you are an Iowa resident and show your ID and give your zip code they will let you in free of charge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tammysH3467FJ
50,Fun and educational for all.,"History comes alive with a tour of the USS Iowa, through both signage, and information from the docents aboard. I particularly enjoyed the video which compared accommodations on the ship before and after improvements. And what a fine touch, announcing and thanking each member of the Service visiting that day.Wouldn't it be a fun idea to introduce a ""1940s Day"", in which visitors would be encouraged to dress in clothes of the period, and music and dance performances could be scheduled?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathyD2054
30,Not wheelchair accessible,I would have loved to enjoy the battleship with my family but I was unfortunately stuck on the ship's deck due to my wheelchair. The volunteers were all very friendly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sabrina_pierce32
50,Great Family Outing,"My wife and I had visited the Iowa during the last Fleet Week last year. Our daughter, son-in-law, and their 2 of their boys aged 14 and 12 thought it was wonderful and the youngest described it as awesome, particularly when he discovered it could ""lob"" a 2700 lb shell 25+ miles downrange with excellent accuracy. As a WW II war history buff there is nothing not to like. And the logistics to keep a ship such as this in action during the war in the Pacific is sobering. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/278keitha
50,Naval Aviation Exhibit,This was the latest of our many visits to the USS IOWA.The Restored HUP-2 Helicopter is outstanding.There is always something new. The crew is very helpful and welcoming to all visitors.We will be back for Fleet Week over Labor Day weekend,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C5400LBjackc
50,Excellent place for visit,"We visited the Battleship USS LOWA last week. It's wonderful and excellent for visotrs to go. We could go into each area of the battleship and the experience was good for us, including adults and kid. It's worth to spend half a day at there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chowkm777
50,Iowa tour,"Educational, interesting informational and enjoyable. The tour at your own pace was a plus since both me and my wife suffer from injuries. Overall a great experience slightly physically challenging due to our conditions but well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/philipr341
50,Amazing experience!!!,"My fiancé wanted to go since last year. I bought tickets for his birthday. He absolutely loved it. It's amazing to be on such an iconic battleship so rich in history. If you're not into history, the size of the ammo and guns are pretty awesome too. Something for everyone. I would highly recommend; such an incredible experience and everyone is super friendly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gmoreno714
40,Geeks and Nerds want more.,"I was hoping that the Engine Room would be available for viewing so that we can see what powered this ship. I was also hoping that there would have been some type of theater with a video showing the Iowa in action and perhaps another showing and explaining as much of the ship's systems and operations as possible. Perhaps another video about the sailor's daily life aboard the Iowa and while in action. I know that docents are all volunteers but perhaps a few more docents explaining facts and features of some of the ship systems would have been great, especially around the bridge/command and control areas. The docent showing the 16"" shells and mock powder charges was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/greghanger
40,Great Day Trip,"A must see if you're into military history.As the lead ship in the last class of battleships the US has built, there’s a lot of history available once you board the ship. The USS Missouri is probably the most famous due to the fact that Japan signed the documents on board that ship that effectively ended their participation in WWII.What a lot of people don't realize is that the USS Iowa was also in Tokyo Bay on that historic day. The USS Iowa is the only Iowa class battleship configured to serve as a fleet flagship. Most of the US delegate was aboard the USS Iowa and then tendered to the USS Missouri for the signing ceremony.The USS Iowa was used to transport President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Cairo and Tehran Conferences; she was outfitted with a bathtub for Roosevelt's convenience -- the only battleship in the world with a bathtub.The USS Iowa Museum has implemented a smartphone interactive app that allows you to tour the ship on your own -- and it's free – so bring your headphones. You can opt for the guided tour, but I felt it to be a little rushed and I didn't get to see a lot of things more in detail -- I'm one of those that reads everything when I go to museums.The app uses the ship's on board Wi-Fi network and location service to sense your location on board the ship. You can use it manually to select what section of the ship you are on and the app will give you information of items in that area of the ship or you can use an option called ""What's Near By” which uses the location service on your smartphone. As you wander along the tour path, it detects where you're at and automatically brings your attention to items that are near you. It’s a little qwerky, but it’s still the option I use when I visit the ship. For those who have a need for more information or trivia, many of the locations have buttons on the app to provide that. There’s also a kid friendly option on the app to follow Victory the dog on a scavenger hunt on board the ship.The museum is a work in progress, so there's a lot of construction going on. There's enough opened to keep you entertained for a good part of the day -- more will be opened in the future as renovations are completed.Bring comfy shoes and expect to step over ledges of doors and be prepared to go up and down very steep stairs, after all, this is a war ship and not a cruise ship.Once you’re done, it’s a short drive or a one mile walk to Ports O’ Call Village for some good sea food.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rglee0
50,Relive the historical U.S.S. IOWA.,I truly had a hard time imagining being on the Iowa during war time. Very brave Navy sailors. The self guided tour was very nice. There were actually vets aboard telling of thier experiences .,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y6118WNscottb
40,Team member of the USA military which played a role in obtaining what USA has in turn enjoyed by all USA citizens,"I love the part of the tour where it shows the actual quarter that Navy sailors live while serving this great country. Just like everything in this universe, there are 2 sides to EVERYTHING. Members of all 5 military branches of the USA can get the glory that comes as they advance in the ranks but they all have to earn every ribbons, honors and promotions and the journey is not a piece of cake at all. I look forward to expansion of the tour which was shared with me by a volunteer of USS Iowa during the current visit to Iowa. I don't remember whether USS Midway docked in San Diego shows the living quarter of that aircraft carrier which my family and I visited frequently when they were kids. Both of them are now teenagers and this is prime time to enlighten them on the principle of ""no free lunch"". I hope this review will help anybody who are deciding whether to visit this great ship. Have fun and learn!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quocc779
40,Very Good Tour of Battleship Iowa,"We toured the ship during a change in command ceremony, so there were many Navy sailors present. There are many volunteer docents on ship for questions; but the proposed tour is self-guided. For children, there is a game-questionnaire at specific spots where there is a picture of a dog to identify the purpose of the location, such as ""Captain's cabin"". however, the tour climbs many sharply inclining stairs that seniors or disabled find difficult. It is best to buy tickets online to avoid waiting on line and get discounts. Last year there was an excellent movie that portrayed a WWII battle involving the Iowa firing guns and defending against enemy aircraft. Unfortunately, it has been replaced by a memorial to sailors that died in an explosion. From a tourist perspective, eliminating that video was a mistake as it was the biggest single attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edvonlef
50,Very interesting,We met my friend with teen age girls. It was more interesting since my husband served in Marines and was on many ships. Lots of steps and walking. For able bodies only.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cherik221

50,Pleasantly Surprised!,My husband and I did a runaway weekend to San Pedro we had a blast at the USS Iowa. We didn't have any plans to go then when we saw it we looked up prices. Normally I am cheap but it was worth every penny. It was so fun and there was so much to learn. I loved that it was self guided.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bribaluyut
50,USS Iowa - THE Battleship,Nothing like this on the West Coast !! Well worth your time to see this superior example of old school naval warfare.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A4984SFsam
40,Great for history and military buffs.,"To be honest, we visited the Iowa in 2014, which is 3 years ago. I chose August 2016 because that is the furthest back this website allows me. We enjoyed it very much. If you are interested in military history, ships or WW II history, this battleship is great to visit. There are placards and photo displays with historical figures for one to read. The tour is self-guided, so it is leisurely and relaxing. The visitor gets a sense of what living aboard a naval ship was like--the tight quarters, the sparseness and the rigors of military life. A knowledge of history would be helpful, as this ship fits into a context of time, place, and historical figures, such as FDR, Churchill and so forth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bgoodtoall
50,amazing experience,Very inspirational. Made me feel proud of our country and military. Learned a lot about history in a way that brought out the relevance of those events. Lots of insight into daily life on board ---- the feeling of camaraderie really comes across. This is a must-see attraction!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R9854FFdeniseb
50,Amazing History,"Such an awesome experience touring the Battleship USS Iowa.

40,USS IOWA,"The ship, photos, docents and the history which is shared are all excellent. Very interesting with a great harbor view. I will definitely go back for the curator's tour which includes areas not open to the general public. There are steep ladders to climb, so wear comfortable walking shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrisdT8368WF

50,Our 3rd (or 4th) visit,"Having visited the USS Iowa, we are delighted to see the expanded areas of the Ship to visit. But, more importantly, is the vast improvements that the docent have made in both there presentations and the information they provided. This made our visit very delightful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O5495LNthomasa
50,First visit to a battleship,Really enjoyed our visit. Great experience. It was the first time that my wife had been on a ship of any kind. She liked it very much also.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myrony808
20,"huge, spectacular battleship but there is no activity","I liked to look around on the ship but it was a bit boring, because I could not touch the interesting things and what I could, that did not work. Maybe some interactivity could lift the joy of the ship-seeing, for example, If I push some buttons in the good order, an engine-sound should start, or similar thing. If I speak into mic, some answer should come. I looked into the telescope, I sat into some chairs, but that's all.Moreover, there is a mobile application, but I could not find it on google play (nor my son, nor the men on the ship). Maybe my android version is too old?The people on the ship were kind and helpful, there rest-rooms, so the service is OK. If you had some money than together with some electrician and some IT guy( programmers) you could make more interesting things.My son(16) bored a bit. I tried to enjoy it despite of the high-priced tickets. (Dont forget to buy it online, its cheaper!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/borkutip
40,Not only for veterans,"Having served in the German Navy 30 years ago I dragged my daughters ( aged 18 and 22 ) onto the IOWA and they were just as impressed and fascinated as I was. The size, the history, the cramped conditions below deck. Pity the wood on the outer decks is in such bad state and many sections like the engine room are not ( yet ) accessable but still very, very worthwhile going. Take AT LEAST 3 hours to tour the ship. Not just a trip down memory lane. You'll get a sense of what life at sea is like. Except for the rocking waves ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V9411XGpeterm

50,Amazing Battleship Museum,"First and foremost, the staff are very helpful and friendly from parking lot to the museum entrance. I went there with my kids self-guided tour and we didn't find it hard to follow tracks.. it's very educational that my kids were able to listen via the FREE Iowa app download to my smartphone ( by buying your ticket online ). Inside the ship is clean and well kept, very organized with their collections. My boys checked every single part of it that they can, sit and relax for some of the benches on deck in between their exploration. I never regret bringing my boys and I will say its worth it! Salute to our heroes back then and the present.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julietj16

50,Gunner's Mate's Dream,"This was the second visit I have made to the Iowa with my wife. This time we had my brother and his family with us.

50,Memories of the Paset,Visiting the USS Iowa was a trip down memory lane for me. The smells and the sights took me back to my time in the Navy serving on the USS Juneau (LPD-10). The greeting at the Quarter Deck and the many former sailors and officers on board were all fantastic. The ships barbershop was special. Thank you for saving this memory. Thank you to all those were served onboard past and present.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl081
50,Selway/Robertson visit,"We had a great time. Learned so much. Kids had fun looking for Vicky Clues. Learning what a great ship the Iowa is. Stories of the battles and how brave the men and women were. Also when they announced my husbands Air Force, Vietnam service made all of us proud.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waynesel2000
50,Totally Impressed,"Thank you for allowing the public to see this amazing ship. My three boys (8, 11, 14), my husband and I really enjoyed learning all about it. I also brought my father, a Vietnam veteran. I really liked that they welcome them aboard and thank them for their service. It was a humbling experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nerdygoofgirl

50,"Battleship Iowa, my ship, my home.","It was nice to visit the ship that I serve for four memorable years. It was mixed feelings to know that she no longer in active but at least I know that she is in good hands now that she has a different purpose. Thank you for everything you do for her, she is looking great and every that I visit the Iowa from now on will be like visiting the place were you once lived, the place were you spend time with your shipmates, your friends, your family. God bless you always.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spanish1959
20,When will new spaces open up?,"Came back down after my last visit in 2013 and it seems like it is the same. No new spaces open at all. It's a battleship! When the heck will you ACTUALLY get to see inside the guns?! Seems like there are areas that a should be made available to the public, but only ""crew"" can go there. Example is up in the Bridge, last time I could go into the armored part, this time it was closed off. Oh, but not to one family that was being taken around. What the heck! Basically I felt ripped off! Not to mention you actually charge service members? Wow, not even the Midway does that and your price is a little steep! Maybe the Port of LA is ripping you off on docking fees to be there since the cruise lines said adios and went to Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7978JNnickb

40,So glad we did this!,"Great way to relate with the solders and see what it was like to be on a battleship! The App provided great educational info for us, but was hard to go in the order we went through the ship. It was hard to find the info that corresponded with where we were.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M2641BIlisab
50,Unexpected but rewarding experience,I brought in guests from abroad and all of us in the group of 8 were amazingly surprised and elated at the exhibit and the history behind it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levonk634
40,Great for All Ages,"My husband and I took our Grandsons (14 & 17) for the Battleship Iowa tour. We split our groups and used the app for a lot of the information. The app wasn't that easy to use & several people on the tour put their phones away when they couldn't navigate. When our grandsons also mentioned that the app was difficult to use, I felt a lot better because they are very good on their phones. The battleship was interesting and I think we all got a lot out of the tour. When the app worked, we found the information very informative and added a lot to our experience. In all, I thought that the site is showing aging. Some of the guns described where covered or missing. Following the yellow arrows on the deck was helpful & we enjoyed the information that several volunteers gave us. I also appreciated the announcements every time a veteran came aboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HLII
20,Very Hot Place!,"Bring your own water! We went in knowing it would be hot, but we never imagined the gift shop and the vending machines would run out of bottled water. We were exhausted and dehydrated by the end (and apparently so were a lot of people). Unfortunately, because it was so hot and we were so thirsty, we did not get the full experience, as we just wanted out quickly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alc468
50,Yet Another Great Visit to the Iowa,"Third year in a row visiting the Iowa. The Docents were outstanding; their knowledge and insight made this the best trip yet! Also, the announcement of any former armed service member coming on board was a wonderful tribute and reminder of all that have served our country. Just saw on the news last night the barber shop is open...again! Keep up the fantastic work of keeping this legacy alive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8rok

50,Visit to USS Iowa,Our visit was excellent. The self tour kept us engaged with helpful guides to answer our questions. Take your time as there are so many things to see.

Every where you turned there was something new to learn about.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108rayk

Thanks for taking good care of the USS IOWA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackshirk

50,US Naval History here!,"I've been on the Iowa's sister ship, the Wisconsin, and like her, this ship does not disappoint! I'm a former Sailor & many of the things I saw here were on my old ship, but seeing them again brought back fond memories...The tour is/can be self-guided (there are small yellow arrows painted on the deck) & there is NO time limit...In the Captain's stateroom, which he gave up to accommodate President Roosevelt on a visit, the President's spa tub is still there in the head (bathroom)...There is also a video/artifacts from the 1989 #2 turret explosion that claimed the lives of 47 Sailors...This DOES include plenty of climbing up/down ladders - exercise caution!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatleyk

40,Great 4th of July Visit,"Being the son of a veteran, it was a great experience. The battleship tour is outstanding, albeit you need to watch your step and duck your head, afterall it was a real battleship. The photo stop is a great souvenir. Your visit helps the ship share its experiences with veterans and school kids to learn about America's past. 4th of July was special with the music and ""pagentry.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casimirot909
50,WWII Battleship brought to life.,"Every time I go back they have added something to help improve the experience. The ship is staffed with actual sailors who sailed on the Iowa. They bring the added dimension of reality to the whole experience. Go soon, before they are all gone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Imorr55
40,Enjoy this tour!,This was an awesome self guided tour. There is an app you can use but we chose to go without. You have to pay for parking so be sure you are ready for that. There are many guides around that you can ask many questions to. Use them! They are great. When going with kids know that they will probably want to run ahead a lot. Saw lots of kids ahead of their parents most of the time. Tons to look at and nothing felt boring or slow. Took some pictures but mostly just enjoyed walking around. There is a great store at the end and then you are all done. Had a great time. It's a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Netty4510
40,Great/Memorable,A really great couple of hours going around USS IOWA. Everything well documented and the firepower upgrades through the years. Gives you an insight into how big and powerful these ships were for the time. Well worth a visit to this exhibit which is not funded in any way by the local authorities or government. Plenty of very knowledgable volunteers on hand to answer any questions you may have.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charles_mellor
50,Powerfull and big,"This is a big ship, it took us 3 hours to go through it. And i loved every second of it.Hard to accept that its redundant.Go to the toilet before you go abord, and load down the app.If you are lucky you run into someone that give you some info on the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/836fredriks
40,For Military and others\ interests,Visiting the Battle Ship Iowa is quite an experience. One needs to visit it to see just how BIG and impressive this (type of) Ship really is.. The Guns are also VERY BIG and MOST impressive..... The 'tour' of the ship is well worth it to see what some of our Sailor's and some other of our military had to endure while on this Ship!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PVJOE
50,Amazing Ship! Everyone should walk her decks,"The USS Iowa Battleship is a big part of our countries history. We are happy they cared enough to preserve her for future generations. I hosted my fathers 90th birthday celebration on board in the Wardroom. He was in the Coast Guard during WWII so we thought this was the perfect venue. Our guests (45 family &friends of all ages) were thrilled to take the tour. The docents are so knowledgeable and have such pride in the ship. Their stories were interesting, funny and amazing. It was a warm day so we warned our group to wear comfy casual clothes and shoes, no heels or skirts because climbing up and down the ladders. Yes my dad took the tour and did great. (But a few of the seniors did not.) I hope everyone comes to experience this hands on museum. There is plenty of parking and clean restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LisaL3272

50,Worth visiting if you are waiting for cruise ship.,"We spent several hours visiting the USS Iowa prior to boarding our cruise ship in San Pedro. Very impressive battleship. Lots of information concerning it's history and the 16"" guns are very impressive to see and learn about. Lots of naval history surrounding this great ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IBMSweathog
40,Great chunk of history,Informative and interesting self guided tour. If you are interested in American history you should go here. Staff are helpful and informative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joryr
40,Interesting and well-kept but somewhat limited handicapped access,"Spent a nice hour here with my Navy vet dad. It's very well preserved, and the staff/ volunteers are quite knowledgable. Handicapped access to all areas is a bit limited, but that's the nature of ship itself, no fault of the staff. They honor veterans with an announcement over the loudspeaker as they board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-LONDON-NYC
40,naval history,"if you love old battle ships then this is the place for you, cost is reasonable lots to see should take around 2.5 hrs to see everything, it takes about 45 minutes to reach there from downtown LA and about 5 minutes from downtown Long Beach, parking is easy to find and only 50 m away from the ship entrance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mulgrew
50,Great piece of history,We completed this tour on our last day in the states. This ship was amazing and us steeped in history. The volunteers on board were very knowledgable with some that actually served on the boat. I would love to pay for the behind the scenes tour but run out of time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chopprrrrreid
50,Amazing history,My first visit to a battleship - so interesting. Spent a couple of hours following a father and son who I had overheard saying that the father (90 years+) was in the service and he was telling interesting stories about his experiences. We spent so much time with them that the Dad wanted to take us to lunch afterwards - but we still had more to see after they left. The documentation/info posted around the ship and the docents giving info and telling their stories was amazing. It was a day we still talk about - amazing history on the Battleship Iowa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T4299XEsusanp
40,Good museum,"If your time is short but looking forward to experience WWII nostalgia, this is the place. The ship is not that huge compared to Midway in San Diego, but the exhibit and tour is well organized with assistance from veterans. Nice time to spend 1-2 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeneP788
40,Overnight stay with the Cub scouts,"We stayed on board overnight. Think narrow bunks and noisy cub scouts. The ship is amazing and the tour we had was very informative, if a little long for a group of 8 - 10 year old. The food for the overnight stays is pretty rough but that wouldn't affect you if you were going for the day. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisePeacock
50,An Aussie on the USS Iowa,"We took a Princess cruise from San Pedro and when I was researching on google I saw that one could take tours of the USS Iowa, this then became a priority. I was not disappointed, what a great time my wife and I had. Big battleship that we could walk all over and inside (most areas!), lots of detail and information from the Volunteers. This quickly became a highlight of our 2017 US holiday and will remain in my memory forever.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steveaC978TQ
50,Excellent experience; both informative and fun,"Outstanding experience for military buffs, and interesting even to those who only had a cursory interesting in this topic. Easy to follow tour route. Good display of the various types of armaments ranging from the huge 16"" guns to the various missiles subsystems. For those areas not open to the public there was an interactive display (wish they had the same thing for some of the other major naval vessels museum that I have visited). Very good indeed, and you can also save on some of the other attractions nearby by buying a combined ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
40,Naval history buff tours USS Iowa museum ship,"My son and I appreciated the extensive background material presented along the tour route, from a broad history of dreadnoughts and battleships to clear explanations of the equipment visible along the tour route, and detailed findings of forensic teams investigating the tragic accident during practice firing of the 16 inch guns. The Iowa provides a unique opportunity to see a ship that had undergone major modifications over five decades of service (!), unlike 'frozen at a moment in time' ships like the Alabama, the Olympia and even the Constellation. A major portion of the ship was open to public access. We would have liked to visit below-decks spaces like engine rooms and barbettes/powder magazines but understand they pose logistics challenges. The interactive video of an engine room was a clever compromise. Thanks to the Pacific Battleship Center for a great job saving and restoring the USS Iowa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmartin230

50,Fantastic tour!,"We brought 130 high school students from our Business Academy to tour the USS Iowa, and this is a tour to remember!

This tour will be a ""keeper"" for our academy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katepab
50,WAR AT SEA,"What an impressive ship! This should be on every man's ""bucket list""The tour guide was fantastic! The history lesson was tops - especially for those of us who are ""baby boomers"" - we got to see the work of a great of the ""builder"" generation. They take the time to honor even veteran who boards the ship - very patriotic! A great $ value - especially if paired with the harbor tour - that way you get to see the ship from water level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vermeling
50,A piece of history,Having lived in Southern California for over 25 yrs. this is the first time I've seen the USS Iowa. What an amazing experience to step aboard this historical vessel and to learn about it's part in creating our nation. I'm glad my family was able to do this together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hazellev
50,Aboard the Iowa,"A great experience, especially if you get the audio tour. We were delighted with how much of the ship we got to see, and there was something new and interesting to learn around every corner. Overall, it was a fascinating tour. My only regret is that we had a time commitment and could not spend as long as wanted in the gift shop. If you have any interest in W.W. II history, this is definitely a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k2wirela
50,Absolutely Thrilled I Went,"I visited the USS Iowa on the recommendation of a professor, and I simply could not believe what a treasure the Battleship is! My words cannot convey what an inspiring experience I had. I went on a Saturday and was fortunate to meet a WWII veteran (LG). He was gracious enough to take time to speak with me about his experience. Amazing! This experience will make a history fan out of anyone. I plan to return with family and friends this summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csky2017

50,Learn our President Roosevelt's Trip to Malta During WW II,"I've now been on the battleships New Jersey, Wisconsin and Iowa. Each one has a fascinating history.what makes the Iowa unique is that it transported President Roosevelt during WW II to the Malta Conference with Churchill and Stalin.Go to his cabin and see the modifications required to accommodate him and his wheelchair and tour his private quarters.The volunteers are fabulous...especially if you served in the military as they ""pipe"" you aboard.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581carlv
50,Battleship Iowa,We were able to visit the Battleship on Memorial Day. it was a wonderful reminder of what others have sacrificed to make our country great. It is also amazing to see the size of the ship. There is a lot of climbing on ladders to get to the top of the ship and some of the ladders coming down are steep. If you have small children someone will probably have to carry them up and down some of these ladders. They also have signs up for the children to search for during the tour. Fun and interesting tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorryWartPB

50,Cool,This was an amazing adventure! My grandfather and brother were in the navy so super cool to see this ship. Was worth every penny just be prepared to monuvere through tight quarters and up and down a lot of steps. But a great experience I hope to remember forever!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer557589
50,If you love military history like me.,"I very much enjoyed this self guided tour using the app. The app was somewhat spotty, but was OK overall. I'm a military history buff so I loved this tour. Someone who's not may find it somewhat boring. Nice access to all the living quarters and common areas. Would have like to see the engine rooms and inside the 16"" turrets, but still a great time. Parking is right next to ship, but I did have to take a tix and pay. 4$",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chakalkar

40,Quite a tour,Boarded the Battleship USS Iowa with a Viet Nam Vet. It was a tour that took him back and remembering. The battleship is well maintained and well worth the wait. The displays are well done and all the ladders up and down are just like they were long ago.Spent some time on this ship. The Star Wars person were there to help us along the way too.Spend a nice afternoon going through this relic,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ravenlady
50,big bigger Battleship,"It was our second Battleship after USS Missouri, it is a great place. If you like engineering, history, Navy aso. you are at the right place. We like it and I`m unhappy that we cant spend more time and talk to the volunteers, ask them they know more than nuts and bolts. We like it because me and my husband are volunteer in the Hafenmuseum Hamburg Germany.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991katjal
50,"Historic, child interactive, great stop",My family of 5 stopped here just before visiting the queen mary (which is in walking distance). This was part of the City Go Pass and made it well worth our time. They handed out a kids scavenger hunt which was fun. There were interactive videos and personal accounts all throughout the ship. Great historic stop. #LOVEservicemembers #ThankYouForYourServiceToOurCounty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanmansmom
50,The Grey Ghost,"We went to the USS Iowa and did the complete tour. You gain an appreciation for the sacrifice on the part of our sailors and marines who served on her. Though state-of-the-art when she was commissioned, it was pretty crowded at a personal level. She was designed as a fighting machine and the people who served her were part of the mechanism.In terms of a tour, look at the generations of upgrades she took on to keep her capable as the enemies changed. This is a great tour but should probably be limited to children 8 and up since the ladders are really steep and falls would be bad. Ask lots of questions of the staff. Navy pride is everywhere evident and well deserved. You can also by package tickets that take you to the Queen Mary or a harbor tour. We took the harbor tour and saw sea lions out at the bouy, massive freight container ships, fish markets and warehouses along with the Coast Guard base at San Pedro and the federal prison on the same point. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/285mikeg

50,So Interesting!!!,My boyfriend who was in the Navy really wanted to check the USS Iowa out. I was a little hesitant but I'm so glad we went. There is so much history displayed on the ship and the story of how everyone worked together to get this ship ready for it's final home in California is a great one! The path was easy to follow through out the ship. Make sure you are able to climb up and down ladders and you don't get claustrophobic in small spaces if you were to go on this tour. There are placards thoughout that explain everything and you can use your phone to get an audio version of the tour. Everyone there was so pleasant and passionate about telling the rich history. It made the experience all that more enjoyable. We purchased the 3 day Los Angeles Go Card for our time in LA and this attraction was part of it so it was an even better value.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leslierh930
40,Nice opportunity to learn about the operations of a famous battleship!,We enjoyed our self-guided tour around the battleship. It was helpful to view a video and to speak with several veteran volunteers to learn more specifics. There were a number of informative displays that added to the experience. We also took the opportunity to imagine what it would be like to be onboard when we slipped into the very tight bunkbeds. The crew had better been quite slender to be able to fit into their bunks. They were stacked so high and tight! There was a fairly large gift shop that offered a wide variety of unusual souvenirs. Plenty of parking was available at the adjacent lot. All members of our group are in good physical condition where climbing up and down stairs is no problem. It might be a challenge for those with physical disabilities to enjoy some areas of the ship. We expected a good experience and had originally planned to visit for about one hour. We extended our visit to well beyond two hours because the ship offered a lot more to see than anticipated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debralynnet
30,"Interesting, but needs a lot of work","This is certainly an interesting exhibit, but compared to things like the Midway, it needs a lot of work. No audio tour available. A few knowledgeable people around to talk and answer questions, but it could use some modern technology to help create a more engaging tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rweissjr
50,Well worth the money!,"It wasn't very crowded. You can go at your own pace. My favorite part was the veterans that served on the ship that work there and tell you how everything works, or some stories about it. You'd be missing out if you didn't do this while you're visiting LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joshz516
50,A great Museum for a great Man of War,"If like to read about the wars at sea. Especially about WWII. Then if one is in LA, make plans to see this monster of steel.While it is very challenging for a handicapped person like me. (A lot of stairs to climb both ways) The docents and the general atmosphere are 1st rate,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidlB7915GV
50,Fascinating tour,A self guided tour which showed a lot of the ship and got a true sense of the operations the ship was involved in. We got extremely lucky to meet a guide who had served on the USS Midway during the fall of Saigon and explained how the ships were used in various conflicts. The helicopter that had served on the ship was being delivered that day after having been restored by volunteers. Well worth a visit if you have any interest in history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttawaCurler
40,If you like military history or ships you will love it.,The ship is hugely impressive. It is not nearly as crowded as the Midway Museum in San Diego. Although the audio tour was disappointing. They have you download an app on you cell phone for the audio tour but it doesn't seem to be completely accurate. There are times when the numbers marked for the audio tour would tell you about something completely other than what you were looking at.Despite the audio tour being kind of a mess the rest of the experience was very good. The volunteers on hand were great and very helpful. There were enough pictures and written explanations to keep you informed as you moved about the ship.There are still lots of areas of the ship that are not accessible on the public walking tour but it appears they want to eventually open those areas up. That along with an improved audio tour would truly make this an exceptional attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Aaron3838
50,Interesting,"A totally unplanned visit but as our cruise ship was moored next to it, we took the opportunity to view. The crew were most informative and willing to answer any questions you have. You can wander around on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MimiA165
40,Fun Tour and Great Wedding Location!,"I visited the battleship on 2 occasions: once to tour the ship and another time to plan/attend a wedding. The tour itself was interesting and fun for folks who like to climb (my grade school niece and nephew were enchanted), as some stairs are like ladders. So, wear your flats and I would recommend shorts under skirts. The wedding location has spectacular views and excellent vendors who turned the ship into a Great Gatsby Dream. However, please be aware that the location can be very warm and windy during the day, so plan accordingly for set up with sunscreen and drinks AND ensure your decorations can withstand the wind. Our tall feather centerpieces, picture frames, and easels did not fair well. Luckily, we had backup short and heavy candle centerpieces, laid down the picture frames, and hid the easels and failed centerpieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraemikoelsaa
50,A must do for any Iowan visiting the LA area,"This is free to residents of Iowa and very educational. There is an app that you can do your own tour with, or you can wander on your own and read the signs. They also have staff (volunteers?) who are former military that can tell you a ton of info. I particularly wanted to do this tour since I had 2 grandfathers in the South Pacific during WWII and felt this gave me insight into their experience. You get to climb all over the deck and go through the upper levels to see officers quarters, mess hall, the navigational area, etc. Not completely handicap accessible, but there are ramps up to the main deck. We didn't spend as much time there as I would have liked (had to skip the museum near the gift shop), but for about a one hour tour still a valuable experience. You have an opportunity to buy a family photo of the ship green-screened behind you at the end of your tour. I paid $20 for 2 5x7's-very fun photos.Bonus if you are an Iowa resident--entrance is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mel65B
40,A True Experience into History of US,"We stopped here without any plan as we saw this battleship from the main road while cruising the coast road. We decided to step into the ship to see what's inside.We found a deal for a Cruise & visit to the battleship together.We spend around 2-3 hours with a very clear path guiding you through the main rooms of the ship with guidance signs along the path.I really enjoy walking through the history of the ship, I was really astound by the fact I walked nearby a Veteran family that visited the ship on the same time and they were really glad to tell me some personal stories!Really inspiring!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelOGlazer
50,A Navy Veteran's View,"I've always enjoyed visiting Navy ships: USS Hull DD 945, USS Diodon SS 349, USS Ticonderoga CVS 14, USS Midway CV 41, and how the USS Iowa, BB 61. Went on a weekday to avoid the crowds. Nice weather, but not enough time to see and read everything plus my feet got sore after a couple hours of walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrrowan1
50,my visit,"was an enjoyable visit and staff were friendly and helpful.Biggest disappointment to me was that Ships store had no Blue ball caps which is and had none in stock for a week or more.So I went home without one and as I am not likely to visit California again ,I guess I'll never get one.Otherwise a good day out when included with harbour cruise",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChrisH7312
50,A walk in history!,"Reliving the past is what you'll do once aboard the USS Iowa BB-61. The ship has been restored, has a self-guided tour, and truly takes one back to ""World War II"" times. Great for history buffs, and even better to educate our young! Worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/611viviana
50,USS Iowa Battleship Tour,"Glad I took the time to come down from Hermosa Beach to this floating museum of a WWII Battleship. Specifically an Iowa Class ship. Lots of on board information and connectivity, but what I would say is the local docents volunteering their time. One guide, Forrest, really took the time to guide a few of us through the ship. I appreciated the Presidential room, with the view of FDRs quarters. Also, learned much about the gunnery and the fire control system. Didn't know how sophisticated their fire control system was for the 5 inch and 16 inch guns with the analogue system of the time. A great visit. Recommend for WWII buffs, ship buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptf2017
50,Never gets old,"I've lost track of the exact number of times I've done the USS Iowa tour (at least 4, maybe 5 or 6), and it never gets old. On this latest trip, a retired USMC Gunnery Sergeant (OORAH!) was a great docent, giving some really neat info on the battleships main gun turrets and ordnance.The display on the history of battleship-specific maritime disasters was a neat addition, although frankly I miss the old big-screen computer simulation of a combined shore bombardment and kamikaze air attack.I also like how they recognise military veterans (myself included) and announce our names, branch, rank, and dates of service on the P.A. system. Hooah!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrojanSkyCop1

A wonderful, local gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240christiana
50,First Hand Experience,"Folks, just imagine yourself onboard one of the greatest battle ships ever made. The USS Iowa fits that bill and she was awesome. To see how the ship defended America with the armaments and technology just amazed me and the kids. This is a wonderful afternoon activity that will provide an excellent picture into one of the naval defense systems we have and to grasp it's size and contribution to the American dream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/howardf308
40,Interesting and enlightening...,Very informative. The ability to connect I-phone with exhibits for explanation made it even better.Not commercialized at all. Navy Vets on board as volunteers.

50,Volunteers onboard former servicemen and women,"Our visit to the USS Iowa was superb! Most of the volunteers onboard had previously served in the USNavy and many onboard ships. They were able to add first-hand accounts of their time in the service which made the visit even more meaningful. One gentleman showing his family around had actually served on the Iowa! THAT was pretty special.The Iowa shares a parking lot with the San Pedro cruise ship building...walking between the two was quite easy. We showed the Iowa ticket booth our Princess cruise boarding passes & they gave us a discount on our visit. They even let us leave our hand-baggage in their office during our visit aboard the Iowa.I travel a lot and visit many ""tourist"" places. The visit aboard the USS Iowa ranks near the top of my list--there is absolutely nothing I would suggest they improve. First class visit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E3788PVcatherines

Self-guided tour either by signs or download an audio tour on your smartphone. We were there about 2+ hours. It is a lot of stairs/ladders but it really is an all ages experience.

50,Great Part of US Naval History,"This was the second Iowa-class battleship I've had the pleasure of visiting (the first was her sister USS Missouri twelve years ago). I only had two hours aboard because of a prior commitment, but I wish I'd had another 30-60 minutes. As an Army veteran and a WWII re-enactor/historian, it was fascinating to me to see how my Navy cousins lived and worked throughout the operating history of this noble old gal. The free tour app that can be downloaded to smartphones is very useful. I even went through the app again after I returned home.I live in Las Vegas, but I'm sure I'll be visiting the ""Big Stick"" again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ETO_History_Buff

50,Very interesting stories,"BB-61 (USS Iowa) is a very interesting, historical ship that is slowly in restoration processes. Restoration is dependent on charity and it's money well spent. The self guided tour is explicit and informational. Unlike the USS Missouri, in Honolulu you are able to tour all cabins, including the one FDR used when aboard the ship.To me this would be a must see for any American proud of our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slautsch

My father was also a state representative, and whenever we kids would travel to the state capitol in Des Moines to visit him, my younger brother and I would marvel at the large, scale-model of the ship found in the capitol building lobby.

It was great to just follow the signs and the route round the ship let you take in all the sights, very well organised and planned out, really good videos and information to go round at your own pace, definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Benno5
50,Worth the visit,"A must see for any military buffs or those that like big things. They don't get much bigger than an Iowa class battleship.Spent about 2&1/2 hours onboard, we did not use the app, just legged it around. Great to see the main guns and to see through the ship.My only complaint as mentioned elsewhere is the lack of underdeck viewing. Would love to have seen inside the big guns or through a magazine etc and down to the engines rooms. But don't let this stop you visiting.This is a real credit to all of those that served on her and that have worked to restore her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rohbrown
40,Talk a walk into the past,"I love WWII and the Pacific theater. The Battleship USS Iowa was one of the most advance ships of the war, and remained in service well into the 1990s. The self guided tour allows you ample time to explore the ship and get a solid overall feel for the living, dining, and how life was aboard this grand ship. I took a lot of amazing pictures with my family, and will visit the ship again in the future. The only downside I felt was that this is mainly an upper deck tour, and I would have loved to explore more of the lower decks, and it seems the only way to do this is if you are some sort of VIP and are grated special access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/forrestmeryl
50,HISTORIC BATTLESHIP,"Really worth visiting this huge battleship in SAN PEDRO.A great history lesson. Lots of history, so take your time to visit each cabin. 2 hours will suffice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/olgalazin
50,"Totally Worth Your Time, Interest and Money!","This was a surprising gem on our spring break trip! We had just been to the Queen Mary earlier in the day and were so disappointed in it, so when we arrived at the USS Iowa, we were blown away by was a great exhibit of US history it is. The tour is self guided and follows a very specific and well-laid-out path around the ship, showing you all the interesting parts and giving you lots of great info about them. The ship has been lovingly restored and is being taken care of. It was such an honor to get to tour it.I would highly recommend it to anyone, but especially history buffs and naval history buffs. It was some of the best money we spent on our trip.One tip - this tour requires good mobility, so if you have someone who is elderly or can't do stairs, don't bother buying them a normal ticket. However - there is a ticket you can buy that's greatly reduced which allows a senior to go just on the main deck and look around, which is still quite a bit to see, and gives them a sense of the ship and its history. There are places for them to sit and wait while you do the rest of the ship.This was an awesome, awesome piece of history. I highly recommend it! (plus it's in the heart of the Long Beach shipyards, so you get to see all the container cranes and cargo ships which is sort of cool in itself!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5280momma
50,Very interesting!,"The tour of the ship was nice. Interesting to see the size of things. However, the real interesting part was the talk given by person who was on active duty during World War II on the battleship. Also at the end of the tour, the interpretive Center inside the ship was very educational.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeG85
30,Ok but lack of information available,"Having just visited USS Midway sadly this just didn't compare. They're largely reliant on an app you download to give you information as you move around the boat. That'd be fine but the WIFI was really slow & didn't always work, so we spent big chunks of the tour without having any clue what we were looking at as there's not much signage throughout most of it. If you went into the map bit of the app it didn't really help as without signage you couldn't tell where you were. If you don't have a US phone & your own data allowance this activity probably isn't for you. The volunteers restoring the boat have clearly made huge efforts & done fantastic work restoring the ship- if they put some signage out too it'd be a far better day out. Because of a lack of info & poor wifi signal this was ok but couldn't be described as good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahe832

We decided to make the hopefully short trip to see it. The traffic worked in our favor, and we had a short trip both to and from the ship.The Iowa is impressive! Even our six year old grandtwins thought so. We had a bit of a personalized tour through some of the battle control spaces and the kids had a lot of good questions about how things were done.Great group of guys around to help with any questions you might have.Plenty of parking.

50,One of Four Great Battleships,"The only one of the four great US Navy Battleships on the West Coast. These were the most powerful Battleships the US Navy produced. This one is in great shape, offers a great tour of the operating decks and has a great museum. Great setting in the Port of Los Angeles with plenty of parking",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califken
40,Need to have proper version of software on your smartphone to download the App for this attraction,"Restoration work done on this ship seems high quality. We enjoyed our visit and were glad for the few signs and videos that were on board to explain the importance of the ship and some of what we were looking at. We probably would have definitely gotten more out of it if we had been able to download the app for the tour, which they seem to place a great deal of reliance on for the tourists to learn about the ship. Unfortunately, the app requires IOS 9.3 or above and we didn't have that on our Iphones and were definitely not going to risk a software update while on vacation, so we probably missed out on quite a bit of learning that could have been done during our visit. One bonus of our visit was being able to watch the loading of a a cargo ship at a dock opposite of the ship. We had never seen that done before and it was fascinating to watch the cranes lift each container off the back of the truck and then stack it on the deck of the ship; the process is surprisingly quick. Our teen is taking a course specifically about WWII and she was really excited about being on the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theatrelover17
40,Historical Nostalgia,"Experience the life of a sailor on tour-of-duty during world War II, the Korean War and the Cold War. Men are usually more interested than women in the guns, rounds of ammunition and missile decks. From a woman's perspective it is enlightening to see the crew's living quarters, complete with wardrobes, photographs and personal effects. The Captain's cabin actually looked more comfortable that I would have expected. Interesting to see the small kitchen area where food was prepared for anywhere from 1,500 to 2,850 crew members.There are guided tours available but we chose the self-tour route which takes 1 1/2 hours on average. It took us 2 hours because we took rest stops on benches provided throughout the ship.There are 84 steps to get up to the top deck -- roughly ten steps between each level. They are steep, metal steps so if you want to get to the top deck, be prepared to climb. We are seniors, and had no difficulty going up and down --- just take your time and be careful. Cost is $16.95 for seniors; $19.95 for adults at the gate.We were somewhat annoyed at the parking situation. The women's restroom was temporarily out-of-order and the 5-10 minute delay in using it resulted in us having to pay an extra $2.00 for parking. The lady at the parking wicket was nasty.However, this had nothing to do with the USS Iowa itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKS2010
50,Incredible piece of engineering and US might,"The Getty Center has a very extensive collection of paintings, statues and an excellent collection of European antiquities, decorative items, furniture, etc. worth to see.With regard to paintings it is not El Prado (Madrid) or Le Louvre or the Vatican museums but it has several interesting paintings of different European schools like: Italian (Tiziano, Carrari, Barbieri, D’Arezzo ); Dutch(Rembrandt, Duck, van Gogh); French (Cézanne, Poussin, Roucher, Monet); Flemish(Rubens), very few from the Spanish school, I remember only one Murillo.In addition to permanent exhibits there are temporary exhibits of great value and the building itself is an outstanding piece of architecture. Do not miss the outside terraces and the gardens.It is not easy to get to the parking area. We always drove to the Getty Center and we usually visit it on the Fridays when I am off work, normally around 10:00. There it might be public transportation (We never use Public Transportation to the Getty) but I guess there it will be buses, no subway, train, etc. So public transportation also will have to fight the traffic.The place is definitely a zoo on weekends, but on week days is easier to get in at around 10:00. Warning; check to museum operating hours and don’t stay too late (15:00 hrs.) otherwise the freeway would be solid. You can also use Sepulveda Blvd instead of the frewway going south toward Beverly Hills or North towards the San Fernando Valley. Going North both, freeway and Sepulveda, will be crowded.During the week, it might be schools visiting which means teenagers doing stupid things but the majority of them don’t pay too much attention and move on quickly. If you are interested in something in an exhibition room full of teenagers, just wait 3 to 5 minutes and the wave will move on.Entrance is free, but you pay for parking. Food is expensive and not that great.The gardens and exterior terraces will be very hot in summer.Worth to visit, we have visited several times but to have an idea of the traffic in Los Angeles; in a low traffic day 12 minutes or less from my house. In a heavy traffic day 45 minutes to 1 hour. Welcome to LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derbunker
50,Amazing Ship,We toured the USS Iowa the day before our cruise. Very interesting and especially so since we are from Iowa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaleJane
30,Nice visit but nothing great,"It depends on what your expectations are. I've been on battleships before so it was not a big deal to me. USS Iowa is very well kept, interesting tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaxBartoli
40,Well Preserved Battleship with Incredible History,"We enjoyed visiting this amazing battleship after a good recommendation from a friend, otherwise we may have skipped this! USS Iowa has an unbelievable history the years it was in service, the interactive displays are impressive. Many retired Navy personnel are also on hand to talk or answer any questions. Great reminders for us all to understand the sacrifices of those who have kept our country free. Yes, there are plenty of steps and rooms to see and things to read. We spent a full morning reading and watching video clips. We did not download the app, but still felt totally informed about the USS Iowa!! Wonderful family experience of our American history! Only downside is accessing the area....we drove to the location with free parking, but it is a congested area, so be prepared for time. Nice restaurant (The Grinder) nearby provided an excellent lunch when we were finished!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mayflower60
50,Freedom is not FREE,This is a must-see attraction when you are in the San Pedro area is a walk back in the time when Brave young men protecting our great nation freedom is not free,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noflackjack
50,JACUZZI-STYLED TUB IN A BATTLESHIP,"We spent about 4 hours onboard the Battleship Iowa and it was well worth it. We have been to 3 of the 4 battleships and the last one on our list is New Jersey. As previously noted in other reviews, there are a lot of steep and narrow stairs to climb. We met a few of the volunteer guides and they are very knowledgeable and helpful. Lots to see, read and learn, including the Jacuzzi-styled tub that was made especially for Franklin Roosevelt. When I saw the black and white photos of Iowa and her crew, I couldn't help but think that I was standing right on her deck as they did back in the 40's and that was just a humbling feeling. The museum store was awesome - lots of great souvenirs to take home (for adults and kids alike) and more than just a few magnets and keychains. PS There are no readily available cabs at the Museum but the attendant is helpful in providing a phone number - wait time is about 10-15 minutes. Would not suggest walking as there really isn't anything nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertaVirginiaGal
40,Great history lesson,The history attached to this Battleship is amazing. Bring the kids to let them see reality and not just battleships on video games. Once you see what life was onboard a real battleship you can take an easy drive and view the history on the Cruise ship Queen Mary.Leaves you really respecting what the people of the military have done for us and continue to do everyday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minischolars
50,True American Icon,"The ship and the men who served on her are a part of American history. The part that makes us proud to be Americans. Lots of stairs , so not great for those with physical challenges.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rightfoot
40,Great Place to Visit!,"First thing I have to advise is that if you are going to visit the Iowa, download the ap before you arrive and make sure you bring some headphones. The ap has the tour and my ap didn't download until I was all the way through the ship. Luckily, my husband has recently spent the night on the ship with the Cub Scouts so he acted as our tour guide.What a fantastic amount of history that we experienced while aboard! I loved the way that all military people were announced as they boarded. Talking to the docents along the tour who served on the ship, or other ships, about their Navy experiences was fantastic. First hand stories are the best. It was quite an experience climbing all around the ship and seeing how the sailors lived their daily lives while aboard. To see the size of the guns and hear the stories of how they operate is hard to believe. The Iowa is very worth the trip. Don't miss it while visiting the Los Angeles/Long Beach harbor area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hrhvictoria
50,1/2 Day Well Spent,Enjoyed the tour. There was gentleman on board ( in his 90's ) sharing his stories of the war in the Pacific. There is a great deal of ladder climbing so wearing appropriate foot wear is a must.On the day of our visit a wedding was taking place on the fan tail with the participants in full naval dress attire as well as a colour guard!A step back in history! The view from the bridge is like a scene from an old time war movie.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stouffvilletravellor
50,Awsume Ship,Well worth the trip if you like history. The staff and presentations were great. A few tricky stairs and ladders if you have a tough time walking or climbing but lots to see. I'm sure the staff would be more than willing to assist. I'm glad they were able to provide the public with an opportunity to see this amazing part of naval history,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/62darcyk
50,A Great Half Day,"There is a lot of climbing and descending of stairs (good walking shoes a must). There is quite a bit to see, The Flag Bridge, crews quarters, mess hall, officers mess and the Captains cabin where Roosevelt bunked when the ship went for the Japanese surrender to name but a few places to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rodman100
50,Much improved since it opened,I had the chance to tour USS Iowa shortly after it opened to the public. We had some time after we arrived at LAX and the ship was more or less on the way to the hotel so we decided to stop and see what's changed since our last visit.The staff has made many improvements to the tour experience and it was well worth it. Just being able to see the inside of the armored box launcher for Tomahawk cruise missiles made it worth it. For anyone with an interest in naval history this is a must-see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/namsman
50,Battleship of Presidents,"The USS Iowa museum is a splendid way for the kids to spend an enjoyable and educational excursion. The Iowa was known as the battleship of the presidents as no other battleship has been host to more U.S. Presidents. During WWII, the IOWA was the ship on which Franklin Roosevelt sailed in order to addend the secret meeting with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference. The Iowa was designated the ""World's Greatest Naval Ship"" because of her speed, big guns, and heavy armor. Lots to see - requires climbing - wear comfortable walking shoes. Volunteers aboard the ship are extremely knowledgeable and helpful - the ship is huge and in excellent condition for its age.Online, full price tickets are $17.95, $9.95 kids, and under 5 is free (think price is a few dollars higher if purchased at the site).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
50,A great day on board,"If you're of an age to remember things like this, or even if you're not, this is a fantastic place to visit. There are lots of guides ready to show you around (Some actually sailed on her) and a lot of places to visit, so be sure to wear your walking/climbing shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Banerman
40,"Very Cool Iconic Ship, Almost Full Access","We attended with our LA Let's Go cards so didn't pay the approximately $18 each entry fee but I think that is a fair price for getting such full access to such an iconic ship. We spent a good 80+ minutes there and probably could have spend longer. The staff around were friendly and the ship has been kept very historically accurate (not a lot of modern junk on board). Definitely a cool attraction for those military buffs, history aficionados, or just those who love boats. Note - those with mobility issues would probably have challenges with all the tight spaces and stairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/usflyer
50,It's Big,"Difficult to get to without a car, but well worth the time and taxi fares. A great slice of American Naval history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flatcapman12
40,Fun Fami,My father was in the navy and was excited to show my children the ship. It was a nice experience to see them having a wonderful time playing and learning about the ship. It was cold out but inside the ship was wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CtoC2016
30,Good one-time visit,Had fun with my dad looking at this old Battleship you can find tucked away in the Harbor in San Pedro.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
50,Great job in restoring this WWII treasurer,"It was a pleasure to finally get a chance to tour the USS Iowa recently while on a trip to S. CA recently. For many years, the USS Iowa was tied up in the ghost fleet near S.F. Bay and I had driven by it many times. When I heard of the efforts by many volunteers to restore the ship, I finally had the opportunity to see their efforts and was not disappointed. Considering how long the ship was siding in mothballs, I was impressed on how much of the ship was available to tour and restored. Yes, it would have been nice to see more below decks (engine rooms, main turrets, etc), a lot has been done in a short time.The app they encourage to download to tour is nice but can be overwhelming. If I can get a chance to see the ship again, I would pay a little extra for a guided trip and hear more of the stories that can't be told by an app.My son was with me for the tour and currently on active duty with the Air Force. I was touched (as was he) when a volunteer asked him about his service and they announced his service over the ship wide radio system that could be heard all over the harbor. I appreciate the volunteers recognizing all of our current service members as well as all veterans who have served our country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottsL5879UP
50,Amazing tour - very informational and bonus view of the shipping yards,Great informational tour of the USS Iowa. Seeing the time and effort the volunteers are putting in was great to see. Walking around this piece of history preserved was amazing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/89theis
40,Hands-on history!,"We arranged a group tour for twenty 12-year olds. Our guide was great - showing off lots of the ship, providing good details, and keeping the kids interested with trivia and curious facts. It was fast-paced, but I think everyone learned something from the experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnregisteredUser2013
50,Don't Pass This Up!,"We were lucky to have a few extra hours during a cruise stop in Long Beach. Our ship was birthed right next to the Iowa. The weather was cold and dreary but as soon as we were on board we were so glad we made the visit.The volunteer staff on the Iowa was extremely helpful. Mr. Crowell gave us and several other couples a very complete tour, annotated with historical anecdotes only an expert could provide.The Iowa also has a great gift shop. I think it is actually better than the Midway.GO NAVY!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tessx
50,An overwhelmingly prideful piece of history!,"We have toured the Missouri in Pearl Harbor, and the Iowa is the lead ship in this class of battle ships. This ship is in fantastic condition, and the self guided walking tour takes you through the living spaces, as well as fire control, helm and flag bridges. You walk by all the armament, including the impressive 16"" gun turrets. The tour takes about 2 and ½ hours taking your time and reading and learning. Volunteers are on board to answer your questions. Pretty awesome day!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgep839
40,Big Steel,"I have been wanting to tour a battleship for a long time. I got hooked into going to Navy Ship museums after visiting the USS Turner Joy in Bremerton WA.After that, was the Midway in San Diego and then the BlueBack submarine in Portland OR.Iowa is impressive at first glance. I enjoy exploring the ship, however not all of it can be toured. I would have liked to go into one of the 16in gun turrets and see farther below deck. I believe that could be a possibility in the future. Alot of history aboard, especially the Captains quarters that was used by FDR for the Teheran conference. I like seeing the old pics they have displayed. Be prepared to scale up and down some ladders as you tour the ship. Besides not seeing a good portion below deck and a turret, it was still amazing to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Molchanbo
40,Saw it when it first got here.,"Easy to get to and in the middle of the San Pedro pier area. Much like it's sister, the Missouri in Honolulu, HI. You can feel the history all around you. Well worth the trip if you are interested in WWII history and artifacts - big artifacts!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmZ4014DO
50,Tour a Part of History,A short walk from the cruise terminal is a piece of history -- the battleship Iowa from World War II. It is open for guided tours daily. And you can go online and order discounted tickets in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl2010
50,A walk through history,"Take your time as you walk through and explore the battleship. It took us two hours to go walk through the ship (follow the yellow arrows). Due to on going restorations, some parts of the ship are not open to the public but you will still get a feel for life on a battleship. The downloadable app did not like to work but there were plenty of tour guides stationed throughout to answer questions and to give more information. If you take the time to talk with them you will get a lot more out of your visit. Make sure you look for the information about Vicky, the most traveled dog in WWII. A must for those interested in history as well as everyone looking for something different. Great for kids. Easy to get to. Parking was reasonable and was the entrance fee.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSMullins
50,Fabulous tour and history of a singularly important US WWII battleship,"The USS Iowa now docked at San Pedro was present at the Japanese surrender after WWII and was the ship that carried FDR along with the *entire* chiefs of staff across the Atlantic to the Tehran conference! Great self-guided tour and exhibits, and wonderful veterans of the USS Iowa on hand for questions and remembrances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrMegalo
40,Battleship Iowa,Interesting to see. I got the headphones to hear info about the different sections of the ship. The recording was hard to hear and the descriptions were actually not in layman's language. If you're not military the descriptions didn't mean a lot. Other than that you did see a good example of life on a ship. Full access to the whole ship with plenty of places for good pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saminkc
40,Very cool for entire family,"I was not sure how our teenagers would react to the battleship, but they all agreed it was very cool. The battleship is massive, so it takes a good hour or more to walk through all of the different areas. There are yellow arrows to point you in the right direction along the tour route. You can download an app to help get details, but there are a number of veterans on the ship who can tell you stories, and specs of all the different sized shells they used in battle.There is a parking lot next to the ship that is reasonably priced(I think it was $6). Adults are $20 each, I'm not sure of the price for children. They take a family picture before you board, and then photoshop you in front of the ship - you can purchase the picture for $16, including a cardboard frame. I would not hesitate to spend $100 again for a nice family outing & education.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RonR823
50,Historic ship open to the public,"Arrived at noon, very pleasant greeting from ticket agent and all employees. Huge ship was quite a sight in person. It is an old boat, which looks a bit tattered in spots and stinky in places, but we were there for the history and that was amazing. Very informative docents stationed several places were enthralling to listen to. Stairs were a small challenge, but not really too hard. Well worth the effort, highly reccomended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockrotator2016
50,Fantastic!,If you like to tour old Navy ships then this is a must. I never relized how big the battleships were. I have toured alot of different ships and this is a cool one you get to see alot of areas that you don't see on todays ships.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freeride_426
50,BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE,"It was a cool bright morning 4th Jan 2017 and at 1030am I boarded the USS IOWA for a tour of this mighty battleship. I am a ship lover anyway but this was just fantastic. There was plenty of guides at hand to talk to you either about the ship and its history or what it was like sailing on the ship when it was in service. Some real gentlemen and down to earth. Ross Tipps had great knowledge of the ship as did JJ Johnston. The tour is a self guided walk around the ship and not an easy walk either, its a battleship with lots of steep narrow stairs. But you simply follow the arrows and spend as long as you like in each place of interest. I was fascinated with the talk on the ships firing power and how it could blast with 16"" guns 500lb bombs 24 miles.Of course when you get to the bridge you get a real feel as to just how large the ship really is, how the sailors slept in those tiny spaces is beyond me. The officers mess and the crew mess rooms were good and one can get a sense for the constant activity that must have been going on. Anyway it is a real must in a city that has so many other attractions like theme parks and beaches to Hollywood homes etc.So if you find your self on a loose end then consider this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/819endac
40,a bit of history with this battleship,This world war two destroyer is located at the port of Los angeles next to the cruise ship terminal and the ports of call. This is a great chance for children and adults to see life on a ship yearr ago. There are many stairs to climb. they offer military discounts,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cat330
50,Excellent history lesson,You don't need to be an extreme history buff to find this interesting.Walk up to the ship and see the huge gun turrets. You can just imagine the places and tense situations that this ship has been a part of.Pretty cool that when Vets come aboard they announce them over the loudspeaker.A well orchestrated tour that covers many areas of the ship. See all experiences from officers to enlisted to even the Captains cabin where FDR stayed and had a bathtub.Interesting that the ship had time in WWII and was updated through the years even up through the Cold War. See nuke capabilities up close.The Docents on board were engaging and had terrific stories to share. Plenty to read and plenty of videos to watch and truly experience history.Plan for two hours. Worth the time spent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TFamLLL
50,Old Battleship that will make you tremble,This is an old ship that dates back to WW2 but oh boy does it feel strong. I hate to be an enemy on the receiving end of this ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NabilAudah
50,Awesome tour of a historic military vessel,"Loved the self guided tour. The docents are very knowledgable and fun to talk to. As a veteran, my husband was announced when we boarded. Wonderful walk through history. It's a worthwhile visit if you are in the Long Beach area. I loved it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jolacabana
50,"""I Completed My List""","I was in Los Angeles for a convention, and this was my opportunity to complete my list of having finally visited all eight preserved US Navy battleships. Each one is special in its own way, and the IOWA (BB61) was certainly was also special. She is well cared for, and the staff is quite helpful. I had my traveling rabbit companion ""Narvik"" with me, and he also had been on several other battleships. He liked the IOWA. We went throughout the ship taking photos and chatting with people. Narvik sat in the Captain's seat. We saw the memorial to the tragic turret explosion, and other solemn reminders about the sacrifices done for our nation. A ship this size takes a lot of volunteers and financial contributions. The teak wood decks need replacing and were covered with sheets of plywood on the bow area. Please help out if you can. I did so, by buying a membership. This is worthwhile, and also allows you a discount on every purchase in the well stocked gift shop. The ship has been modified for its post WW2 service, but there are displays showing all phases of the modifications over the decades that she served. I will definitely visit again if I am ever in the area. Two rabbit ears up!!(\ (\( -.-)o_("")("")",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/33310Marc1960
50,Fun and historic,I thought I would check out the USS Iowa as I could purchase a deal on the Queen Mary and Iowa for 39.95. I'm glad I did. This battleship was in great shape considering what it was through. Lots to see and the walking tour was well marked. There were a view spots to stop and watch informative videos along the way. Be careful as stairs are steep. You can walk just about everywhere on this ship and was a lot of fun by myself. Very family friendly as well. There is a gift shop at the end of the walking tour that had a great variety of souvenirs. Highly recommended. Also plenty of parking right there next to the ship. It only cost me 2 dollars for parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFLapham
50,Tour of history guided by a vetaran,"It is an eye opening tour. Detail explanation through out. Fun for kidsn be able to experience n immerse to navy life. Sample missile, launchers, control room, war room etc. SEEN PRIVATE BATH tub of Franklin Roosevelt too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/starystarynite
50,EXCELLENT TRIP BACK IN WW-2 BATTLESHIPS,"Wife and myself took a trip specifically to see this ship in San Pedro, California. Before our trip I called and talked to CRAIG to make sure of dates and times and would advise you do the same. Craig is the best and he loves what he does. That phone number is: 1-877-446-9261. Craig has found a great group of tour advisors to help guide you around this great ship. They also know everything about the ship and don't be afraid to ask if you need more information. The tour is a self guided type and it's directed by small yellow arrows on the deck. However there are volunteers along your route to help. Now, there are many steep ladders and tight doors to work your way through so if you are not into such things then this is not for you. One thing to note: Your young kids will love all the climbing and hall ways. It's like going to a jungle gym for them. Be sure to read all the explanations written over things that need explanations. When I said WW-2 ships I was just saying that the Iowa did her best work during this war as she sailed long after being updated with modern war methods. This is a must see trip for you and your family and for those who served on her: Thank you for your service. Ron.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avie8tor
50,Absolutely stunning. .fantastic,"Great few hours visiting this massive battleship, the ship is in great condition and looked after with passion. Very helpful guides are on hand to answer your questions. This is hands on history would visit again if ever in LA. Well done to all involved in the running and maintenance of the Iowa. Parking was very reasonably priced and so was the cost of boarding the ship. 10/10",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/25611111
50,A must see emotional visit,"As someone who has never served, this is my second military ship tour (the other being the USS Midway in San Diego)This is by far one of the coolest tours I've ever been on. The stories and explanations the quide told as a person who was actually active duty on this ship were both amazing and emotional.Standing next to the huge 16 guns used to blast the hell out of Japan left one with a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear if one of those things were ever shot anywhere near me.Prices are very reasonable, and it took us about 2 1/2 hours self quided.I highly recommend a USS IOWA tour if in the Los Angeles area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4143RHjoem
50,Its an Honor to see the mighty USS Iowa BB-61,"The first time I visited was on Veterans Day when the ship was first brought to LA Harbor. What an awesome battleship, history to see and feel on the decks. In July, I took a harbor cruise and saw the ship from the water, even better! Raw Power and Grace, a Memorial to the men that served on her !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1wayfaringstranger
40,This is History in action.,"Meandering up the coast, enjoying a few days off, I saw a sign pointing to Battleship USS Iowa. So we turned off to take a look. My wife had never seen any of the battleships close up, so I jumped at the chance to go aboard and take the tour. Spent a wonderful couple hours poking our heads into different cabins and climbing steep stairs. But overall we had a great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normh714
50,Best battleship museum,"This was the first battleship built to these enormous specs, hence it's called the Iowa class - BB-61. We've been to all of them, the USS New Jersey BB-62, the USS Missouri BB-63 and the USS Wisconsin BB-64. While they all look the same, they are all slightly different so it's fun walking through each of them. I actually learned the most about the battleships on the USS Iowa and their staff, mostly veterans, proudly share their amazing stories of serving on her. Plan to spend at least three hours, it's that good! One cool thing I learned was how battleships got the name ""dreadnoughts"", it's found on a plaque hanging in a lower deck. The first ""modern"" battleship was the HMS Dreadnought waaay back when. The admiral's motto was ""Fear God and Dread Nought"" and had a double meaning - Fear God and nothing else and also Fear God and his Dreadnought, the battleship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888arthury
40,Amazing piece of history,"WWII Battleships are that of legends. These were the brutes of the sea were one of the most feared of all warships of all time. They are no more, except in maritime museums. This is one of those. Still impressive and cutting edge technology for it's day it is well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danr975
50,Best museum ship I've been to.,"Wonderful display,more or less everything except machine rooms were accessible. Went on Veterans day (extra activity), spend on board >3h",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L7838DHpatricks
50,USS Iowa Visit,Be sure to visit this ship and start in the morning or early i the afternoon. Also with those who have time to volunteer the group who does a great job i maintaining the Iowa are always looking for more volunteers especially if you served with the US Navy or Marines. Great history and amazing tour and it was great to meet with those who served onboard the USS Iowa. Theres also an exhibit towards the end dedicated to the Turret 2 Explosion in April of 1989 which killed 47 Sailors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350vishalp
50,Worth the visit and a great history lesson.,Visited here on Veterans Day which added to the experience as there were many veterans visiting. Volunteers are assisting with the restoration and are doing a fine job. Lots to read and see and one can easily spend a couple of hours here. Not the most physically accessible site given the nature of a battleship. Worth a trip to see and plenty of other attractions in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loesshawk2015
50,Great piece of history available to all,"Great way to spend 2-3 hours for everybody, not just those who are interested in military. We were on Monday during working hours and there were not many other visitors which just enhanced our experience. Extra attractions available to kids (finding spots throught whole visit to complete a contest card). Definitely worth the money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaGPL
40,A must for battleship fanatics,The overall experience was good. Everyone in our party enjoyed the tour and seeing all the various historical elements of the ship. There was even a WW2 veteran on the ship available to explain a lot of the processes and quirks of serving on the ship during a time of war. Sadly he is the last remaining survivor of that era that served on the Iowa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/245henrym
50,Dreadnaughts of the sea,If you are at all interested in Ships this is a must stop. As you step onto The Battleship Iowa you are transported into the past and reminded of what our veterans experienced. It is not hard to imagine yourself sailing the seven seas in this mighty vessel. On occasion you can witness WWII aircraft buzzing around in the sky's. take the time to walk around the ship. Ask questions of the guides they have all the answers. Since it first docked it has changed and continues to do so as volunteers open new areas to visitors.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/893ralphz
30,Interesting,Decided to have a look round this fantastic ship while killing time waiting for our cruise. It is a self guided tour with lots to see and learn. It's well set out with very informative displays and historical facts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/694paulg
40,It is huge,I have limited time and just stopped nearby and was amazed at the size of the battleship Iowa. Since I didn't go inside I can only tell you that just to see the Iowa is amazing and worth a quick drive by.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycep883
50,Great for families and historians,"I was never in the Navy but I love military history. I don't think it would work for a baby in a stroller, patient with a walker or wheel chair, it is a Navy ship so many steep stairs and passages. They have been doing a lot of work on this great ship, I have visited a few times since it first arrived in L.A. ,and always love the waterfront and this ship. Many very knowledgeable people to help with your tour, some great pictures and other displays. Close to the Aquarium of the Pacific,another great attraction in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcU4242KX
40,BB61 - A treasure,"Had discounted tickets, but happy to pay full price. An informative visit. Ship was well restored and in good condition. Guides were knowledgable. Unfortunately the engine room and engineering spaces were off limits. We combined this trip with a cruise around the harbour, which gave good photo opportunities as well as an impression of the size of the ship. Both the ship & cruise recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PHEL56
50,Nicely restored like new!,"I actually toured the USS Iowa in November 2013. Forgot to review it. I'll say it was amazingly beautiful to see for the amount of time it was there. Hated seeing it sitting in the Concord Naval Shipyard being mothballed all those years in the past. So happy to see it and tour it finally! IT is an amazing piece of history and the self guided tour is very easy and self explanatory. Two men that were actually crew members of the USS Iowa were there for you to greet in person, and it was the highest honor to meet the men who fought for our freedoms. Getting my photograph with them I enjoyed more than getting photographed with celebrities, as these men are my true heroes. I was on an emotional high the whole day because I met them. The stories they told were amazing to hear. I recommend everybody go visit the USS Iowa when in the area. I also made an additional donation to help with the continued restoration. It feels great to give to a great cause.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HighlanderLJ
50,An American Treasure!!,This historic WWII vessel is a piece of our history. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed touring this magnificent ship. As far as I am concerned this is a must see if you are in the area. Jim the tour guide is awesome and has so much knowledge of the ship it is incredible. It's unbelievable that this ship was left to rot and then brought back to life thanks to many individuals and volunteers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jarbra15
50,USS IOWA -Historical Navy Ship,"Very impressive and historical tour of a battleship! We purchased our tickets online before our arrival to Long Beach via cruise ship. Our tour took about 2 + hours with arrows that directed us throughout the ship. Having family members and friends who have served in the military and on Navy ships, we were amazed by this stately ship and its rich history. Volunteers at the USS Iowa are former military. Please consider making a donation when visiting the ship so that restoration can continue as this is the last remaining ship in its class!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobettern
50,Such a fantastic history lesson,This has to be one of the attractions for long beach if you are interested in ships and the history of the Pacific Ocean and battles for it the ship has a fantastic tour that has to be done if you are lucky enough to bump into the curator (my friend for 40 years) he has a fantastic log of battle ship history and can tell you as much or as little as you want to know I am very lucky to have David Way as my friend and on our 2 Nd visit to the ship it still intrigues me and still haven't managed to take in the whole tour so unfortunately mr Way same time same place next year can't wait too return!!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiniStigdad
50,A Must Visit,I'm a bit of a military nut so this was food for the converted. Arrived late afternoon but still able to park very easily and tour the ship without any prompting by the volunteer staff. Originally planned to do the Queen Mary but prices for 4 adults and two teenagers cancelled out that tour. Instead we did the USS Iowa and was pleasantly surprised with more reasonable pricing and easy self-guided touring.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toko1942
40,an interesting historic old navy ship,"We went with a large group that broke up into smaller ones for the toru. the tour guide really had a command of his subject. They are all former military. While the guys were more into this than the ladies, all enjoyed the visit,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180carlj
50,Legendary battleship,"USS Iowa (BB-61) is the lead ship of her class of battleship and the fourth in the US Navy to be named in honor of the state of Iowa. Owing to the cancellation of the Montana-class battleships, Iowa is the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II.In present time she is huge museum. If purchase tickets on-line you'll save 2$-17 $.Access to the Ship store without tour costs 7$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DmitryCH67
50,Very interesting and historical experience,"I'm originally from Iowa, so this held a more personal aspect for me. and my father was a WWII veteran. He loved visiting historical sites, and so this was a natural for me. Take some time and look around this important piece of history. Consider making an additional donation, since the more funds are available the more they can open more areas to public access. Very impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevefromVegas
50,"Great tour - use a live person, not the app. Also, do not wear flip flops or heals","The tour was very interesting and the weather was beautiful. They are restoring more of the ship every month. I went with my uncle who had served on the USS Iowa and he said that the restoration was well done and they included a variety of time periods. The app and self guided tour are not very easy to use. It was much better to go with one of the volunteers who actually served on the ship. They were more interesting and gave it a personal touch.They tell you not to wear flip flops or open toed shoes, but they let you on anyway. You do not want to. It is difficult/dangerous to get up and down the ladders and you cannot see everything or much at all if you do not.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lewisdeb
50,Great museum ship,"The USS Iowa is a museum ship in San Pedro. The one negative is you have to pay for parking. This is a must-see for anyone interested in American maritime history or World War II. If you are a veteran, tell the docent when you get aboard the ship and they will announce your arrival.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939delberte
50,Very interesting ship to walk around!,"If you're in the Long beach San Pedro area, or if you just like ships and war museums, its a great attraction. It takes about a couple hour to complete, and its very easy ""just follow the arrows"" type of tour, which takes you through all the ship. There's even a App you can download which guides you once you're there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnW885
50,Amazing!,"Even if you are not a big fan of "" boats"" or don't know much about history or it's not in your interest during your trip to LA I would for sure recommend it as a must stop.You start with a short introductory video which is very light to see, even for kids and then the guiding is great, you have all the proper signalisations and information.I might not know much about US. History but I loved it and was very much into it, there are even Veterans working there and it was an honour for me to have the chance to speak to them, you can really feel the love they have for their country and the ship while they give you some explanations and kindly answer your questions.Simply an amazing experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltiris

50,"Interesting, informative, historic!","Firstly, the Iowa is in the harbour at San Pedro and not with the Queen Mary or Aquarium. We mistakenly thought it was at Longbeach. However, it is only a few miles away and well worth an extra 10 minutes drive.Parking is plentiful and easy, right beside the Battleship.Can't exactly remember the entry cost but we thought it was value for money.There are various short films & informative signs along the tour route once aboard and we were even lucky enough to have a veteran (marine) give several of us a fascinating, informative and amusing talk about the history of the Iowa - thank you 'Gunny'!!We appreciated the work & dedication that had gone into restoring this historic Battleship and highly recommend that you go & see it for yourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynnpatricia
50,Very Interesting site,We've been to the ship twice and will probably go back again. The historic value is amazing but it is also a great learning experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mazsterm
50,Incredible,"We love military history and the USS Iowa has seen so much. It was fascinating to walk through and envision those who had been here before including US presidents. The ship looks really good. We were honored to meet some wonderful veterans on board who shared more information with us. They may not have all served on the Iowa, but did serve on similar vessels or during missions when the Iowa was also present. Being from the state of Iowa we had always wanted to visit the museum after they brought the ship back to life. My husband's only disappointments were not seeing information on the design and building of the ship initially, and not being able to access all areas of the ship. The only complaint was having to follow a specific route and not being able to get in and out in different areas. One member of our group tired early and sat down, but was unable to visit the gift shop without going through a lot of the climbing etc. The gift shop should be accessible to all, especially those with some physical limitations. We knew ahead of time that there are difficult areas for some but didn't realize you couldn't easily go back and retrieve people who have to sit down on the main deck. All in all it is an amazing ship with so much history. A must see for history buffs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Iowamom93
30,Not so Interesting,"The battleship is great but the visitor experience is terrible. Visitor needs to follow a certain path to explore the battleship that makes me boring. Displays are dull and static, need more creativity to make it interesting.They provides a mobile app that hard to use and not user friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jazarja
50,Nostalgic naval ship..,This is was a beast!. They sure don't make them like this anymore. Workers are super friendly. Most are retired Veterans that work on donations. So make sure you are respectful. If you're current or past military ask for the Veteran discounts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaymesp2016
40,Piece of History in LA Harbor,"Having been before to USS Midway in San Diego, which is wayyyy bigger in size and therefore packs in more in terms of an attraction, I must say I still enjoyed going through USS Iowa. Where USS Midway gets more interesting below the deck USS Iowa makes up on what's above the deck - the cannons etc. are really cool and this comes from a guy who is not into military, nor weaponry. It's $20 per person, somewhat expensive in my modest opinion, (USS Midway was $15 per person a couple years ago when we visited San Diego) and to get there takes a moment and patience with the directions from the GPS but I believe it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reedmangreg
40,Good museum,Very large battleship with lots of interesting facts. It took us 2 hours to walk around the ship...there were videos to watch and information boards. Very informative visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kir2
40,Enjoyed visit,Very interesting self guided tour of battleship including museum items and historical facts. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MagicFlute
40,"Amazing Slice Of Nautical History, Must See!","There are very few places you can see one of these vintage battleships and the USS Iowa is convenient to anybody passing through LA. It's right off the freeway in Long Beach. You can pay a few bucks for a self-guided tour and walk through about 50% of the ship at your own pace. You absolutely get the sense of what it was like in 1944 to be aboard her during WWII. It's great to see the antique technology as well as some things we don't even know how to make anymore. Often, there is a veteran who served on her during her service years around to talk about the ship (great!) The only thing that could make it better would be if they could drive the ship around the harbor (impossibly expensive) or fire the big guns (also impossibly expensive.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaltMorton
50,Excellent Visit,"My younger son loves this museum and we've visited three or four times in the last few years. Our latest trip was on Sunday, Sept 18 which was also the 27th Anniversary of the Brewer Brother's Model Kit, Hobby and Toy Expo, so we got two events for the price of one.Each time we've visited, the museum has made some improvements - some minor, some larger and more obvious. During our first visit, most of the ship was still off-limits as they cleaned it up. Gradually, more and more areas were available to the public.It makes for an interesting contrast if you visit this ship and then go down to San Diego and visit the U.S.S. Midway. The Iowa is low, squat and bristling with weapons and has a thick armored hide. The Midway is spacious, airy and feels like a really big target. Speaking of low, there are a lot of stairs (us civilians call them ladders), really low ceilings, exposed pipes and beams and high door sills. Watch your step.There is a lot of history packed into this museum. Take your time and listen to the different video presentations of former crew members. It'll give you a great idea what it was like to serve on this huge ship. In particular, compare the crew quarters that you see now with pictures and video from her World War II days. Vast difference! Also, make sure you read through the information on the galley and then ask yourself if you could keep up with the cooks who served 5,000 people per day (7,000 during WW2).Since this was the Modeling expo day, there were a lot of vendors selling plastic model kits, RC kits, and various military paraphernalia. Once you combine the cost of parking and entrance fees (the expo and museum are separate) the price of purchasing a model is more expensive than, say, Amazon. However, it's fun to visit and I splurged and we bought my son a model tank.The museum is easy to get to and right off Highway 110. If you're from out-of-town, you might combine this visit with the Queen Mary, Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, and Aquarium of the Pacific all of which are within easy driving distance of the USS Iowa. Then, take a 30 minute drive down south and visit the Lyon Air Museum next to John Wayne Airport.This is an excellent museum and well worth the visit. Plan on spending at least three hours. Again, remember that this is a walking tour with lots of stairs. I would not recommend it for folks using walkers, such as my Dad, or strollers. Bathroom facilities are on-shore (nothing on the ship). Hopefully, they'll open a small cafe or something as right now, food and snacks are limited to the gift shop's snacks. Occasionally, there's a food truck in the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls
40,Cool museum,This former battleship was a cool place to visit. They had an app to download which explained a lot. This was a historical vessel and even though it was self guided; I learned a lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rich122014
50,If you love history you should see this!,"This battleship has seen a lot of history and every piece of it is displayed throughout the floors.

50,History,Very interesting and informative even if you are not a total military buff. A lot of climbing and areas to explore I found it to be very educational and left knowing a lot more about Battleships. Warmly recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnC14887
40,If you have a time - go for it,"Best time - Monday morning - they open at 10, so the number of visitors is minimum. And you can walk slow. It is just amazing - tons of steel, armour. Just - WOW.Listen to the stories of the crew and imagine how they lived at that time. Walking and looking at the incredible guns, armour. The thickness of the steel at the bridge is just breath taking. Still some areas are not for visitors. So - if I am there - need to pay a visit - one more time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jacek1410

50,Big Boy,"Very nice visit, access to many parts of the ship. No turrets or engine room available yet. You can self guide or hang out with a group or talk to the many dosants available. Downtown Pedro by 7th street very good for lunch and dinner also. Seaport village has a ways to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlakeusa
50,Mighty warship,Impressive from any angle the history and scale make this a very interesting visit. The main gun turrets are enormous and go down several decks to the magazines the scale is hard to comprehend. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/902mikess
50,USS Iowa,"I've been back here so many times that I bought an annual pass--I love seeing this ship. I'm in total awe of it and its engineering. There's something new to see every time I'm on board as they continually open up new parts of the ship.They now have a 360 degree way to see parts of the ship not yet open, like the Engine Room.It's great to see schools bringing kids to see and learn about our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/451BobB451
50,A good attraction,"I loved touring this battleship, learning about its history, and seeing the awesome artillery. I took my two kiddos along, they are only 7 and 9 years old. They stayed well entertained and focused, nearly the entire time, with the scavenger hunt they provide for young ones. It got a bit jammed during the descent. It takes kind of a long time for some people to get down the stairs; the stairs are small, narrow, and at a steep angle. It definitely isn't for anyone who has a hard time going up or down stairs. Other than that, it's a wonderful trip to take with kids, friends, or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meander194884
40,History at your fingertips,"Ever wonder what was it like on a battle ship? This is your chance, and take a tour on this truly magnificent battleship. The huge turrets, the wheel house, the command center, the galley, the walk ways. Self guided tour with guides standing in strategic places to answer your questions. An afternoon well spent wondering about the ship stopping at places to reflect on what the sailors every day life would have been like when this battleship was making its rounds . Money well spent on this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8741NDdavids
50,What a find!,"Visited USS Iowa as part of a two week vacation in California. For me this was the highlight. Even my family wife daughter and son really enjoyed it.The attraction is mainly run by enthusiasts who are both friendly fun and very well informed on the battleship.Whilst a bit out of the way for mainstream tourist activity, The Ship was very easy to find and ample parking is alongside the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bristolbristol
50,Such amazing history,"I was lucky enough to visit for a charity event. It is such a beautiful site with so much history. If you are into history, boats, military, etc, this is a great place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matiasstof
50,Great Couple of Hours,I Really enjoyed the USS Iowa!! It's a little out of the way but worth the cab ride. Very helpful staff around to answer questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Disco007
50,History of an amazing machine,"We went the past Thursday. We love all related to history of war and battles. But either if you don't, this a really nice place to spend the afternoon or morning if you like. The tour is self-guided with an app that no always works very well, but is not so necessary. There are veterans that welcome and may assist you if you need. I recommend booking online for a discount. I used viator. You're also going to need to present the e-voucher at the entrance so they give you a printed ticket, but no troubles there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/diegolaass
50,Love the incredible history,We thoroughly enjoyed visiting this piece of history. It is very well done. This is more interesting than you may expect. There is some important history connected to this ship - including the three presidents who have been on the ship. Be aware that there is a bit of climbing up narrow steps. It took us over 3 hours as I like to read things and listen to the videos. But it was worth it. Could have used a little more time in the museum at the end as it had a great summary of American naval history. This is worth the price of admission (and is free if you are from Iowa!).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesW367
30,Poor signing and location.,"We didn't have time to visit the ship, but wanted to take some photographs of it.It is in the middle of a heavily industrialised port and you have to negotiate the stream of heavy goods vehicles going to and from the location.If you miss a turning, the next is not necessarily going to get you where you want to go.Very poor signing.Should be in a more accessible and impressive setting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flantheman2334
50,Experience a Real Battleship!,"You'll wonder at the workings of this long-used battleship. As you walk the different levels and hear real-life stories from former servicemen, you can imagine yourself on that ship during WWII and after as it was in service keeping the U.S. safe. Discover the dogs that once lived on-board, search for the beef stew recipe that serves 2300 hungry servicemen, lay on a 3 tier bunk, and climb the many stairway ladders. This is a great visit for families. BONUS: With a valid Iowa Driver's License, you visit for FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgwelsh61
50,Glad we did this!,We really enjoyed this!! So happy that we made time to see this piece of history. A truly devoted staff. We felt like there was so much history. Everyone that we made contact with was more then helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Klime82
50,We Found Vicky,"We took our son here for a Saturday morning tour, the volunteers were nice and friendly.

I can't wait to go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,Fascinating,"It is fascinating to walk all over this battleship - a ""living"" museum of a past era, when battleships ruled the seas.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herrityandy
30,Disappointed,"As a Navy Veteran, I was excited to go see the ship. I did not go aboard, I felt the $19 fee to be rather high for a self guided tour. The very least they could do is offer veterans a free/reduced rate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480beckin
50,Fantastic trip to the Iowa,"I had a WONDERFUL experience aboard the Iowa. Everyone we met was kind and generous. It's clear that the people here really care about their ship and it's history. The love and attention they have put into renovating it is apparent everywhere you go. The new museum section is stunning, and I love the interactive touch screens that let you tour the locations on the ship that are still restricted. (We were told that they cannot allow access to some areas of the ship until the military officially releases their right to recall the ship for service, which will happen in a few years) So the staff there came up with a fantastic way to allow us to tour those areas virtually until it opens to the public.They even have a summer Pokemon special for admittance! That was pretty cool. I highly recommend you visit the Iowa. A special thanks to Captain Abele for the tour! We had a fantastic morning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/398cricketm

40,Great Warship to explore,"This ship has a self guided tour or you can join in one of the guided tours. Be sure to check out the Presidential Bathtub of FDR installed for when he was on the ship in 1943. The video showing various bunk arrangements was cool, and there were soooo many kitchens on the ship. It was a lot more than I expected. The whole ship smells like old war (Burning oil) but it was pretty cool to check out. Several places on the ship have small passageways so it is not really accessible to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PastorC_12
10,RUDE DISRESPECTFUL WORKERS,"MY boyfriend and I went here during Lobsterfest on saturday, and we thought it was cool until the security was forcing us to hurry up because they were closing in 45 mins. we told them not to rush us due to the fact my boyfriend had a bad knee and they didnt care at all. they told us our tour was over and kicked us out. someone escorted us out and telling us to hurry up or else he will call back up to get us off. we went as fast as my boyfriend could go and he said we shouldn't have taken the tour if he could not walk fast enough. once we got closer to the exit, other security was there and out of knowhere the guy started to act all nice saying be careful where you step and being all nice. This is the WORST place to go. these people are rude and did not care for others at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/684cathleenc
30,OK,"If you are over that way, go visit, It was included in our LA go Pass (which is worth buying). It was ok to visit, nothing like the Midway in San Diego though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenHancock
50,Pretty awesome,"My wife was in LA for a business trip and I tagged along. I read about the Battleship Iowa in the Trip Advisor must do's for LA. I had visited the USS Iowa in Virginia Beach, VA and that was a totally different experience in how they let you tour the ship. USS Iowa can be self toured ($16) or tour privately ($99) with the curator. The curator tour looked pretty awesome (approximate 3-4 hours long) and it consisted of videos and additional areas of the ship you don't see on the self tour. I wasn't able to book the private tour because it was booked up 6 weeks out but I would have liked to.I got to the Iowa when they opened and I got right aboard. Once on deck, I was greeted by one of the many veteran workers and he asked if I was a veteran. I replied yes and he had me fill out a form with my service information. Shortly later, I heard them welcome me aboard the Iowa and mentioned my service.The staff will recommend you download the USS Iowa interactive app, which is what I did. The app works with your gps and it functions as a tour guide when you stop at all the different attractions. I took about two hours to walk the marked tour area and I was not disappointed.Parking isn't free but it isn't that much, approximately $6 for my trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDavis227
50,cool us history,I enjoyed this trip to the ship if you like us history or WW2 history this is a cool trip to hit. The ship has a lot of sailor who served on the ship and love to talk about how it was back in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noahd2016
30,They REALLY need written information.,"The ship is interesting and very historic. The bad part is the phone app they expect you to use while touring the place. We downloaded the app. Sometimes it didn't seem to work at all, and when it did, it the information was mostly presented in the form of videos which were annoying to deal with on the phone. There are only a few occasional signs scattered around the ship, and they don't give you any sort of informational brochure when you enter.Not only was there no brochure we could use while touring, they didn't even have anything available to buy in the gift shop. There were tons of generic military souvenirs, but almost nothing specific to this particular ship. I'd have gladly paid $20 for a good book about the Iowa, but none was available.I really wanted to like this place, but of the tourist attractions we saw in Los Angeles this ended up being my least favorite--it that was almost entirely because of the lack of written information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmbia
50,If you have kids this is a must see!,"We're in from Iowa and heard Iowa residents get to tour for free so we thought why not? It would have been well worth full price admission!We went with our four kids, ages 11, 8, 7 and 18 months. They have a small scavenger hunt with a prize to help keep the kids engaged. It's self-guided and kids enjoyed exploring the ship. It took us about 90 minutes.There are several ladders, make sure to have sturdy shoes and we had a child carrier for a little one - Highly recommend! I'm not sure I would attempt this with a free-range toddler. But with a carrier it was a great experience.When we came on there was a WWII vet who had served on the USS Iowa and was returning for the first time since WWII, he is now 92. They had a full salute as he walked up the gang plank and a big welcoming party. It was great to see the respect and gratitude towards this old solider.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/herd_of_6
50,Must see...,"This is a must see.. The crew that work on the ship are so knowledgeable about the history and they are happy to take the time to tell you. We did not use the app for the self guided tour we just walked around on our own. this trip was with my husband, son and daughter in law. When we came on board the crew found out that my son is active in the Navy, they announced him being on the ship over the intercom and thanked him for his service. I thought was so niceI cant tell you about the price.

Admission is a bit steep and it might be nice to include the option of earmarking your fee to a specific ""next step"" renovation if there was hope that the funds could open more spaces with a forward looking plan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
50,A must see.....,"The Iowa is a must for anyone who appreciates American history. And we all should. It's what made us a great country. The patriotism is palpable, the ship oozes history and the tours are interesting. I am not a big military buff, but I thoroughly enjoyed visiting this wonderful retired ship. So nice it was preserved for future generations, and to remind us of those who keep us safe and have protected our future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BCMCLover
50,What a great trip back in time!,"What a great trip through time! So much hands-on history on this tour. Using the app for the self guided trip was a bit complicated, but I feel like i've experienced a bit of our history by visiting this vessel, and sitting in the chair's that so many others in our maritime past sat. A great trip with my wife and 3 year old.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V5286KLmarka
40,historic ship,We took our grandson to visit. For 3 adults it cost $48. So it is not cheap however it is good to know the money is used to maintain such a great ship. My only complaint: I wished they opened more parts of the ship on the self guided tour (like the engine room) overall it was a good experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mxguru
50,Interesting tour.,"I took the tour solo a couple of weeks ago. I have done a aircraft carrier and submarine tour in the past, and battleship Iowa matched them apart from one department. It doesn't have a headphone tour like the other two do, which I found very useful while on the other tours.They did say to download their app for a more interactive tour, but I didn't have enough signal to do so, but even then I think a headphone information system for different spots around the ship would be brilliant.Apart from that, the tour itself is fantastic and interesting to see. I learned a lot and the sleeping areas still wow me for some reason even though I've seen similar before. I would recommend for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevingV2412HR
50,Interesting and maintained by caring volunteers and staffers,"We like to view military museums, so enjoyed our visit. It isn't too much different from several other naval vessels we have toured. The workers really made this special, though - eager to talk to visitors and answer questions. They know so much about the details of this ship and clearly enjoy sharing their knowledge. Be aware there are only two bathrooms - one near where you get tickets and one near the exit off the ship. Also, there are lots of steep ladder-type stairs. Probably not appropriate for young children or for those with limited mobility. They could still enjoy the main deck, but you really need to see all the levels to get the full experience. Being right on the water there is usually a breeze on the decks, but can get a little stuffy in the interior areas. Military members were formally welcomed on board by a PA announcement - a nice touch. Our local military MWR ticket office had tickets for the ship at a lower price than the on-board military rate, so if you plan ahead you can save a few dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/91914
40,"Impressive ship, ""Tour"" app is cumbersome","I recently visited this ship and am glad I did. The entire battleship is on full display, and a walking tour leads you through all its myriad compartments and passageways.Very cool - it gives you an excellent idea of what our servicemen and women went through, and just how they lived day to day.My sole gripe with this place lies with the download - able app. I understand what the were trying to do here. It's a laudable idea to have the tour integrated with one's phone but in practice is VERY finicky. Perhaps it's the vagaries of Bluetooth but while proceeding with a tour, the app would suddenly not recognize where I was, prompting me to wander about the ship desperately looking to reconnect with item number 4, or whatever I happened to be looking at.They are far better off designing a tour that is less ""interactive"" and simply displays numbers that you can punch in, like at other museums.Other than that, it's a cool place to check out. Added bonus is that is at the Port of Long Beach, so you may see large cargo ships float by during your tour. If you are into ships or have an appreciation for large scale engineering, it's quite a treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Samir427
50,Not only for former Naval Officers,"This former battle ship is a great place to take dads on Father's Day, the ship is well kept in her original stage. Our kids were excited that this was ""the real thing"". The best: a bathtub installed for use by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during his transit for the Tehran Conference with Churchill and Stalin. Great for a weekend excursion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UlrikeZ280
50,Walking back into history,"I went with a group of guy friends, several of us vets. If you are even remotely interested in history, a visit to the Iowa will knock your socks off. You can tell that the faithful few who run the USS Iowa museum work their butts off to keep her in good shape for the rest of us to experience. There's nothing quite like seeing those huge 16"" main guns up close, or seeing the size of its anchor chains, or climbing up to her bridge and getting a look out across her monstrous deck and San Pedro harbor beyond. She actually was not only involved in WWII but participated in action in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. I didn't know that L.A. was a major repair port for US battleships during WWII, so it's fitting the Iowa makes her home now with us. You'll have a ton of photo opportunities aboard so be sure to bring your camera. There are many, many stairs you have to climb up and down, so wear sensible, non-slip shoes. There's no time limit as to how long you can stay, so mobility-challenged folks can take as long as they want or need to go from room to room. Be advised, however that there are no elevators, and a lot of stepping through hatches/passageways, so wheelchair bound folks might not be able to see much. I'd strongly advise calling ahead to find out if wheelchairs are even do-able there or not. BUT, if you're up for a fun, relatively inexpensive, family and/or buddy outing and you're in at least reasonable physical shape, tromping all over the Iowa makes for a GREAT day - one you'll remember for a long time to come. I HIGHLY recommend going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelarnold
50,Great trip for the Family,"Have been wanting to go see the USS Iowa and we finally found the time to go with my Son and his 4 year old daughter.. Had heard this was something that needed to be seen.. We were told by a friend that they engage small children to participate in a hunt (like where's Waldo, but for a dog) Zoe was given a card to find a cute little dog picture that is spread through out the ship and if she found it and finished the card she would get a gift at the end.. The ship itself is really amazing and impressive, having her running around and being trilled to find the pictures was precious.. Many ex military on board to help with questions and their tour on the boat.. For a family this really was a great outing and it's a great way to learn about Military history.. Beautiful ship and lots of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeriJoe
50,Navy Memories!,"For someone that has served on a navy ship The USS Iowa will bring it all back to you! The atmosphere, the looks and even the smell of naval fuels. If you have never been on a war ship this is a fantastic opportunity to have a look and imagine the experience. It was great!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karl081
50,A visit with past shipmates,I think any ex serviceman especially a sailor will find this to be a worthy experience. I didn't serve on a battleship. My tours were on a LST and and a aircraft carrier.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert042
40,Very Nostalgic,We took our father who served in the Korean War with the Navy to see the battleship. He enjoyed the trip down memory lane. For the most part it has been well restored. The deck flooring needs to be redone but it is an old ship. Guests can touch many things. You can feel like your part of the ship for a moment. I'm so glad we got to tour this piece of history with our dad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PamelaS3700
40,Memorial Day,We visited on Memorial day and there was a lot of veterans there and we loved it. So much stories and history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sahlander
40,Military History Lesson,"My 10 year old son and I toured the Iowa on a Monday morning. There were several school groups also taking the tour that day. The retired military volunteers walking around on the ship share a lot of additional interesting facts and stories. The ship is well laid out, so it is easy to take the tour without getting lost in the ship. You can easily spend 2-3 hours walking through the ship. When you are finished you have a good appreciation of what it it like to be stationed on a Navy battleship. The history of the ship is amazing and just seeing the room where President Roosevelt stayed while traveling to Europe during World War II was worth the price of admission alone. There is also a large gift shop with many interesting items. If you have friends visiting from out of town, this is definitely a tour to take them on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E655CIcharlesw
50,NAVAL HISTORY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED,"I'ma sucker for big battleships and the Iowa class has always been my favourite. To have this treasure in San Pedro is special. I've spent many times just riding my bike up and taking in the power of this warrior of the seas. Then again when you go inside and see what life was like, how the 'fought' this weapon system or just marvel at the nine, 16"" guns, is something else.It is not for those with mobility challenges which is understandable given the time and purpose for what it was designed. Nonetheless, you may just enjoy sitting on the deck taking it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
40,Interesting,"We brought our grandson to the USS Iowa. He was looking forward to seeing boat with ""cannons.""It cost roughly $34 to get in. Our grandson was free. Basically the exhibit consists of a self guided roped off tour which covers a lot of the ship bow to stern. We saw the galley, bridge, sleeping quarters, and many deck features. There are a few steep lasers to climb, but our grandson did well. It was fun looking for ""Vicki's"". An image of a dog you find in certain locations.We found the tour interesting and my four year old grandson did too. The only drawbacks were the steep ladders he had to climb and about 1/2 through the tour he needed to go potty. There are no restrooms on the tour, so you needed to finish the tour if you have to go. Workers told is there were restrooms at the end of the tour on the stern of the boat, but we could not find them. We had to walk to the entrance to find restrooms.Anyways figure on spending a couple hours touring the ship. We found the ship design features interesting and the scale of the ship amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chrismJ7789SF

50,USS Iowa,"A great piece of naval history that is well displayed so that you can see and touch most things while you tour the ship. Everything is in the same condition it was when it last served, so it is all preserved so you can see just how the people who sailed on her lived and worked onboard. Easy access via public transport or self drive, reasonable prices, well informed tour guides and a wealth of memorabilia to see, this is a well worth visiting floating museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/575tonyj

And you also have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/insight2actions
40,A TIME CAPSULE OF SACRAFICE,"We arrived early as it can get very warm in that ship as the temperatures.The ship has been meticulously maintained by volunteers (many former servicemen) who are so helpful in answering questions.My uncle was a ""lifer"" in the navy a would describe life at sea but this museum really brings out the minutia, the camaraderie and the drudgery of life at sea.The highlite was the "" firing station"" as your can see what it was to ""lock and load"" the 5"" guns.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAFFSTOP
40,Worth the money,This is a great historic experience. It's a bit out of the way from Hollywood so it may not be for everyone. Me and an army buddy went here in May of 2016.

50,"Great Vacation Idea, Incredible Opportunity to learn about our Country's History","So I was doing a little history research when I was goofing off at work, and I saw that the USS Iowa was in Long Beach. Knowing that I was going to be taking a trip to LA, I absolutely made this a destination of mine.When we got there, it was incredible and breath taking. Of course, a lot of my excitement came from the research I did, understanding the significance of the Iowa class battleships, and how they played a role in the last 60 years of US Naval history. Best money I have spent for a museum in a long time. I plan on coming back, and potentially becoming a donor",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/probballchamp

40,What a great look into Naval history!,"We spent about 4 hours on board, and wish we had a couple more. We did get to see most of what was open, and were simply enraptured at the history of the vessel and loved seeing the progress being made to both keep it true to it's proud heritage and keep it in shape enough to tolerate the amount of visitors it receives. I LOVE the ships PA system announcing each veteran by name as they come on board! The only downside to the visit was the app that they said would explain the various points on the walking tour wasn't functioning well; most times we would get only part of the audio, and sometimes it wouldn't work at all. Disappointing, but we still enjoyed the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKFatBoy

40,Wish they had more open,There was a lot to see on the ship but I wish they had more open. Specifically the gun turrets and their five levels.I did like the app but only worked on about half the ship then it thought I was not on board when I was.Very good historical tour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricP278
40,Surprisingly a lot to see,"My first impression was I would just walk around the deck and some guns, but it was very interesting. Many displays throughout explaining interesting facts about battleships and about the historical significance of this one. After WWII it was upgraded with tomahawk missiles and anti missile Gatling guns. We spent about 2 hours. Parking was easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4253QTcarlosr
40,Fascinating tour - will improve as more areas are open,"The USS Iowa is an interesting ship as it was built in 1945 and then upgraded to much more modern technology over the next 45 years. They offer an extensive tour of the superstructure (decks 01 - 05) and the main deck, as well as large parts of the second deck, including the Captain's quarters with the Navy's only bathtub. (Installed for FDR.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dave_in_Reno
50,Impressive,"The last battleship class built by the U.S., and arguably the finest battleships ever built. The ship is well-preserved and well presented, although it's clear that it will take many years to be able to show it to full advantage.We took a tour, which led around the main gun turrets, up into the bridge, along the superstructure past a secondary battery turret and some missile launchers, and down into some crew spaces, ending in the gift shop that was converted from a galley and mess compartments. There's a whole lot of good stories, including the only time Iowa was hit by enemy fire (a barely-noticeable mark on No 2 turret, or was it just behind?), a recreation of Franklin D. Roosevelt's cabin, details of the wood on the decks, the different types of steel used for armor, and other interesting details.If you're interested in fighting ships, WWII, naval history, and the like, it's a must-see ship. Presumably, it's a lot like its sister ships (Missouri, Wisconsin, and New Jersey), so it may be a bit of deja vu if you've visited one of the others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leifb763
50,Great Historical Treasure,"I have been to the ship several times for different venues. Since it is always being restored, every time you go there is something new. You can drive from the Queen Mary to the Iowa (just a 10 minute or so ride on the terminal Island bridge(Seaside Fwy.).I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dhmcclemens
40,Very interesting part of Naval history in a lovely location,"This is a really interesting museum / battleship. Really enjoyed our visit. Its amazing how long this ship was used for active service. The history of Roosevelt meeting Stalin and Churchill on board really highlights what an important role this ship played in WW2.The only downside was the giftshop. The staff kept following us around and watching us as if we were going to steal something. Then they gave us a number of ways to make an extra donation for ""our troops"". I advised the girl they are not my troops and then politely declined. The entry price is not insignificant so I had already considered that my donation.Anyway, the gift shop staff need to improve their customer service skills but the ship is definitely worth visiting and we only had 1 week in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Visitor23_13
50,Amazing piece of US Naval history!,"The USS Iowa Battleship Museum is easily accessible from the LAX area (about a 25 minute drive) and the parking is plentiful and reasonable. I believe the first hour was free and then it was a few dollars an hour after that. The tour of the battleship is self-guided and relatively inexpensive. However, there are several knowledgeable staff on board to augment the experience. Placards, videos, and even an interactive app help guide visitors into a deeper appreciation for the vessel. The ship is 100% maintained by donations so be sure to visit the gift shop or drop a donation in one of the donation boxes stationed throughout. This was a great way to spend an afternoon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/irunnoft
40,great parking and only 2 dollars for 2 hours.,get a taste of what the brave men who served on this mighty vessel went through over it's lifetime of service.

Iowa again it's our third time , And had different tour guide each time , And we saw something different each time , The Staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable and helpful and the gift shop is Awesome , Any time were in L.A. we stop by the ship .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josepho298
50,Overnight program is fantastic,"I am an assistant scoutmaster and led an overnight trek on the USS Iowa. We had an incredible time and were able to view sections of the ship the general public does not go. The folks on the Iowa gave us an incredible tour that I will never forget. It is incredible to be on board a piece of history.To any other Boy Scout Troops out there I highly recommend the USS Iowa overnight. We slept in the same bunks sailors slept on the ship. We were provided with dinner as well as breakfast, which was good.I would rate this attraction as excellent and two thumbs up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875charlesm
50,Well Worth It.,This ship is well worth the price of admission. That being said there is a lot of climbing narrow and steep stair. If you have any mobility issues you might want to reconsider this tour. The tour is self guided with lots of volunteers to explain the workings of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/azcherrybear
50,Great,My 9 year old son absolutely loved touring this ship. It has such history and amazing stories. We enjoyed every part of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jengue
50,Great Batlleship,"Part of the history. Amazing those huge guns. Great the comments of the retired crew funny histories and details....The only shame it's that there's only 2 years that the ship can be visited and almost all the lower decks are closed to public, hope in same years they open: engine rooms, turret loading systems, the same big turrets it's not possile to get in. But was a pelasure pay to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogerFiu
50,Great History,A friend was in town fro Freezing Minnesota. We went mid week in Febuary and it was a No Crowd day. Very Nice. Received the Veteran Discount to boot. They took my name and branch of service and announced over PA to welcome me on board. This is done with all Vets.{even salty old Marines} Walking tour is a little bit of work climbing up and down steep ladders so be prepared. Nice memorial by gun turret forward were crew was killed during a fire exercise off of Puerto Rico. Parts visited were in great shape. Seems like USS Iowa could sail again with some work.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rondo
50,As expected - interesting,This was a recommendation from a friend and not really being a war buff was a bit dubious. Very glad I went - informative and a perspective you can't get from film,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradj190
50,Nicely preserved; great historical perspective,"Staffed by vets, this battleship offers history and education about the eras in which it was used as well as the San Pedro area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viewsaskew
50,"Awesome ship, awesome people, great history, and great views.","Really enjoyed walking the decks of the Iowa, and learning the history of this great ship. The people working there were very knowledgeable, and proud to be part of the Iowa legacy. As you walk the decks don't forget to look around and enjoy the views of the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543douglass
50,Our 7 Year Old Grandson Loved it,"So grandpa drove down to San Pedro with our 7 year old grandson to see the Iowa. There was good parking and easy access but I do not think it would be easy for anyone with handicaps because of the doorways, ladders and passages are made for young people to hop over. There is a well marked path to take and the 7 year old enjoyed filling ojut the map and then going to the gift store. I ended up buying him some big battleship toy that he just had to have. In fact, I don't think he was going to leave without it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lynndds
50,Last of her kind,"The USS Iowa was on my agenda and the Metro Silver Line let's you out right in front of entrance. History abounds everywhere on this great warship. Three 16 inch turrets and cruise missile capabilities along with Phalanx guns and Harpoon and Tomahawk missles. Great floating history of WWII, Korean conflict, Vietnam , and Desert Storm. Have been here twice and found new things every trip, wonderful and historical. Great attraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J679XGthomasp
40,A Piece of History,"On the way to see the Queen Mary, I saw a sign for the Battleship USS Iowa. Being a Hawkeye Grad I had to stop. Historic ship that transported President Roosevelt and his cabinet to the Teheran conference in 1943 as well as being part of the Japanese surrender.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fourth_T
50,Amazing work at restoring this ship.....excellent visit!,I have always wanted to go round this ship since I heard it was now a museum and it wasn't disappointing! The ship is huge with props at every corner showing how life was on board all through her years since the second world war. The staff were very helpful and chatted to us for a long time about the ship which made us feel really welcome.I am very pleased that they told the story of the 1989 turret explosion which killed 47 crew.....it is nice to know that this is not forgotten and the victims are remembered on board with a memorial.The gift shop was very well stocked with the woman behind the till more than happy to help.Ended up spending so much time on board I had no chance to see anything else that day! Sign of a good attraction.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richj970
50,Really fun but you need both legs for sure!,"Strange how everything is so quiet now but still so powerful ! Do not miss and you cannot Roosevelt room ( Iowa carried him across the Atlnatic to Mers el Kebir,algeria en route to a crucial 1943 meeting in Tehran with Churchill and Stalin.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbylake
50,Memorable History,"A wonderful piece of American military history. Although the ship isn't completely open, the parts that are are well worth visiting. The tour guides are great and I if there is any ionterest in American naval history, this is a must visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/314billw
40,Depends on your interests,"We live locally and were excited to have a new attraction to bring people to San Pedro. We visited soon after it opened and found it interesting, though not especially of interest to me. I can understand that men particularly would love seeing her. It is rather difficult to tour with lots of steps and some narrow passages. The deck itself is rough and could cause falls to those not alert enough. A lot of volunteer hours go into its operation and I appreciate its importance in American history. It is a definite asset to the community.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellernot2rist
50,Most interesting afternoon,"I really enjoyed the afternoon spent on board U.S.S Iowa. I'm of the battleship generation.(The ship is only 2 years older than me ... and in much better condition!) The tour is fascinating; the staff, both on the ship and ashore are great! Friendly, very knowledgeable and great to have a chat with.I've since watched a few Youtube videos as my interest has been whetted.Highly recommended and many thanks to the staff who made it such a great afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike8256
50,Historic Battlship from WW II to Coldwar,"I highly recommend this ship for history buffs as well as to acquaint younger people with the history of the US Navy warships. This ship,had four presidents on board throughout its history. It was present during WW II, Korean War, VIetman war and the Cold War of the 1980's. The volunteers found throughout the ship offer so much info and answer questions. Using a smart phone you can have a history packed event. I did not know I would enjoy it so much.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/101NDTraveler2013
50,WONDERFUL STAFF!! made our trip home wonderful,Thank you to the staff at USS lowa. They helped us out when Princes Cruises messed up our transfers to the air port and would not help out. The staff let us store our back packs and were so nice!! One staff helped us book a shuttle so we could get to the airport which took a long time!! she did this on her break. The ship was great as my son love this stuff!! The people are enthusiastic and knowledgeable!! Thank you staff you made our trip home wonderful!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThisMomwilltravel
40,Kids loved it and learned a lot too,"Did the overnight tour with out Cub Scout Pack and had a great time. The boys brought down the ships colors and then we got to eat on the ship and then took a guided tour of the ship. We learned a lot about the ship, its role in WWII and some of the unique things this ship did. The guide was really good and the boys had tons of questions for him about the ship, WWII and the history surrounding the ship.We then slept overnight in the crew racks. Woke up to a hot breakfast and then put the colors back up. The staff then helped us pose as a group in front of the big guns and then we were free to tour the ship and again and spend more time in areas where we wanted to.Everyone had a great time. I would definitely go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbartoletti
50,American Pride For Serviceman and Veterans Will Surround You,"Every American needs to take the time to visit such an attraction. Even if you have a mobility device, find a way to see a partial tour of a battleship with character, through and through. No words can truly describe what it is like to walk on a battleship once used to protect our seas and land. The artifacts alone are worth the price of admission. There are challenging steps and steep ladders; children will need to be carefully supervised. But any age group will find an unexpected thrill you will want to share with anyone you know who loves wartime history. Definitely bring a camera, comfortable shoes and a jacket. Come early as doing a rush tour will leave you longing for a return visit to see what you may have missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roseh187
50,Historic Ship,"This battleship is well worth a visit for an hour or more. The guides in each area are fantastic and very knowledgeable; most of them having served in the US Navy. There are several historic points of interest related to this ship, for example, battles in World War II. For a personal guided tour, download the app to your phone and use the Bluetooth points around the ship. Ship’s merchandise and memorabilia are available at the on-board shop. If you sail into the Port of LA, it is right there in walking distance and there are discounts by showing your cruise card. Normal entry is around 19 US Dollars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikesierra
50,Enjoyable,"I have no interest in this kind of stuff, but my hubby who's Retired Army LOVES Military history, so we decided to take this self-guided tour.It's actually pretty interesting. You climb up and down different levels and go through different areas of the ship. It was very enlightening and I actually enjoyed it.Some of the stairs are VERY STEEP and there is no elevator! The tour is upwards of 45 minutes depending on how much you read.The ONLY PROBLEM I had was where the gift shop was located. You have to climb (up or down - can't remember) those STEEP STEPS, and you MUST HOLD THE RAIL (which in a few places on the ship is a heavy chain link and not an actual rail) so for people with purchases, it's a bit treacherous.If the gift shop were located on the exit deck, it would be easier and not as hazardous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnerVortex61
40,Great day at the harbor,It's a great place to visit with your family not expensive everybody very friendly and it's a good way to spend the day and local,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/767dannyf
50,Take time in Battleship from the past,We stopped in this Battleship from World War II before we boarded our cruise ship. It has been restored very well and has excellent information along the way. Interesting to see how these men lived and worked on this ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fizzy1991
50,Great piece of history!,"I took my 8 year old son for our first tour! The weather was beautiful! The self guided tour was very informative and interesting for both of us. The game for children was great entertainment for my son, he had a puzzle to complete through the tour. At the end he got two prizes which were very nice. We liked our pictures, bought the two for $20. Staff were kind and add to the tour. I like that it is self guided, easy to follow and a great part of American history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U3901OSlisac
50,Well worth the time to explore,"We went into the visitor centre in San Pedro and the guy gave us a 'two for one' pass which was great, normally $18 per person. We thouroughly enjoyed exploring this vessel with all its history. You have to see the equipment to appreciate the immensity of the workload that this battleship undertook and the sheer volume of administrative and operations management it required, back in those days. We took lots of photos and we told lots of people how amazing it was!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HelenH770
50,A visit to part of our Military Past,A wonderful place to see a piece of our military history. See just how big and grand these ships are and how far science has taken us when you know that as powerful as the Battleships seem to be. They have little to know useful purpose any longer. Airplanes and missiles have made them obsolete at least for now.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/486luket
50,Tour An Amazing WWII Battleship,"You do not have to be a veteran or history buff to enjoy touring the USS Iowa. The fully restored ship is a remarkable example of America's military might and would be intriguing to young and old alike. The Iowa has a rich and colorful history going back to its launch during World War II. After its final decommissioning at the end of the Cold War, the ship was taken over by a dedicated team of volunteer veterans who toiled for years nursing it back to health and did a beautiful job restoring it's luster. This ship is huge and will impress anyone. The tour is self-guided but takes a visitor through various parts of several decks. You can take as little or as much time as you like to complete the tour. It is a revelation for anyone who wonders what life was like on a big Navy fighting ship. Although the ship and the tour are excellent, the location near LA's ""terminal island"" is a challenge, particularly if you need to use public transit to get to it. Depending on where you're staying and how your traveling, allow two or three hours to get there and the same to get back (I was staying in Burbank). It can be an all-day excursion so perhaps include a tour of the nearby Queen Mary as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wmloyd4855
40,An Interesting Slice of Hstory,"We went here one sunny Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed the visit.As you scramble around the shop, on the deck, below decks and up and down the ladders, you get a real sense of the ship and its history. The helpful and friendly docents help fill in the gaps and answer any questions.A great way to spend a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShadowyMan
40,Impressive WWII Battleship,"The USS Iowa is an Iowa class WWII battleship and is permanently docked on the San Pedro waterfront inside of the large, Los Angeles Port. The ship is permanently docked next to the Princess and Norwegian Cruise terminals. This ship was commissioned in February 1943 and went on to serve in both the Atlantic and Pacific Theatres. At the end of WWII it sailed into Tokyo Harbor with the USS Missouri and was nearby when Japan signed the surrender agreement.I visited this impressive WWII Battleship with my wife on a Sunday in late January and enjoyed walking around it. We did not have enough time to tour the inside of the ship so looked at it from the outside (we also viewed it from the other side while on another boat). You can view the ship for free from the outside but must purchase a ticket if you want to go inside. If you just got off one of the nearby cruise ships you can get a discount if you show your cruise card. I visited the USS Wisconsin (Iowa’s sister ship) last summer and actually liked that ship better (it seemed better restored and cleaner).Overall I really enjoyed visiting this history WWII Battleship and highly recommend it if you are visiting LA and are a military or naval history buff. In addition, if you are cruising out of San Pedro on a Princess or Norwegian cruise this is a very easy attraction to visit (as the cruise ships are only about a block from this historic Battleship).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockyjoe
40,Very informative,"Wonderful morning out, walking tour across the boat, with very friendly volunteer US service staff, who were fascinating to talk too. If history is your thing, this is a must see and do :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sam5LovesToTravel
40,Respect,"A trip back in time. This ship was launched in 1942, some 74 years ago. While walking around the exhibit, you can imagine life aboard ship. The volunteers working there were happy to answer questions. Video displays were interesting as was the USS Iowa app that could be downloaded. I have always been interested in the history of naval warfare and this display did not disappoint. Great respect for the crew who sailed in her and all those affected by the fatal accident in Turret #2 that claimed the lives of 47 sailors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlennA612
30,great for some and not for others,"I went here with my husband and his aunt and while it was nice, I was kind of bored. If you are interested in battleships and war then this is for you. My husband loved it and thought it was the best part of the trip. There certainly was a lot to see and guide around every turn to explain more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rand0mgirl
50,Great history lesson,"Wife and I both enjoyed this visit a LOT!! While still at the beginning a docent showed us a seal sunning itself on the float next to the ship. Only real complaint was a little difficult to see the films with the sun so bright. Lots of benches scattered around for temporary rest spots. Got to meet one of the last 3 survivors from the USS Hoel which was sunk in WW-II. Game of find the mascot dog Vicky kept my wife busy but she did enjoy this visit. Glad to buy the pictures, books and a couple of other trinkets as MANY MORE DONATIONS ARE NEEDED TO PRESERVE THIS PIECE OF HISTORY!! GO SEE THIS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardf47
50,An honor to be aboard The Iowa,"The Iowa foundation continues to add and improve the exhibits and its work becoming a member. Easy access to parking but the ship is not accessible as it's a battleship. The wood deck, the size of the guns, turrets, everything is huge. Climbing down original steps means wearing appropriate shoes. Retired Navy personnel add a colorful twist to information given. It made us proud. I would be concerned on a rainy day or an extremely hot day for viewing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772vs
50,Would like to return,"We visited on the Iowa Hawkeye rally day and it was packed with people. It was a gorgeous day and the Iowa fans came out in huge numbers. I would love to return and tour the ship. Three hundred people can tour the ship at a time, and the line was a two hour wait. We would have loved to tour, but did not wait. It is an interesting area around the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joaniemaria
40,A very good floating museum!,"The power was out the day we were there, but that didn't deter us. We are from Iowa and were admitted free. The tour guide that accompanied us was very knowledgeable of the ship. Well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDWLOO
50,Definitely Worth It!,I toured the USS Iowa right after a cruise holiday that ended in San Pedro. This ship is not just a symbol of American history but also a part of world history and events that will be studied for generations to come. It is the ultimate naval symbol that has lasted the test of time. The staff are friendly and informative. Many are ex crew members and veterans and volunteers. This is a family friendly place and it focuses on the history and struggles of the past. They are constantly opening up more areas of the ship to tour so expect it to get better every time and hope that more tourists spend their dollars here to help restore and preserve this important piece of world history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brisbane41
50,Living history lesson,"First a few things-not handicapped accessible, there are lots of tight corridors and steep stairs. Wear apprpriate footwear, no sandals or heels. Parking is plentiful and $2 an hour. If you want to park at ports of call and walk it, ports of call parking is free. The ship was great. I learned a lot. My favorite park was speaking to the three veteran volunteers. One was 98 years old and present at Japans signing if the surrender. The other man was younger, and told an interesting take off how his destroyer was sunk and he spent 3 days floating in the ocean before being rescued. The third man was on the ship that brought our soldiers back to the main land after the war was over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RPVTravelmore
40,Exciting and educational fun visit.,"Visited here this week with grandchildren age 13, and really enjoyed ourselves. The first thing you notice are the volunteers everywhere, eager to tell you stories about the ship's history. The preservation/restoration is exceptionally good, and we enjoyed learning the history of the ship, it's history of presidential visits, it's display of presidential chairs, and the tour of the entire vessel. The grandchildren, born in the age of digital were obsessed and transfixed with rotary dial telephones. There are numerous steep stairs to travel from one deck to another, and we did not inquire if there was an elevator somewhere so accessibility might be an issue. The gift shop and museum is below decks and very good, albeit a bit muggy and warm. All in all it was a fun day and we learned a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryal
50,It's the IOWA,"If you like naval history, this ship is for you. If you like battle ships this ship is for you. This is self guided tour covers many different levels and compartment of the ship. You go at your own pace there are lots of hands on items, a ton of history of the ship, places to rest and volunteers to ask question to. If that's not enough, it's a real life battle ship! Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I4887QNchrisc
50,Must see piece of history,"My grandfather served on the USS Iowa and it was an honor to visit the ship today. It is well maintained and has very informative signs and pictures as well as volunteers that are more than happy to share their wealth of knowledge. Interactive scavenger hunt makes it fun for the kids and provides them with a prize at the end. Great gift shop too, we were very impressed with our visit to this impressive ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luckyno39
50,Worth a visit,"Being a visitor to USA we wanted to have a look at some history of the wars and this is a great example. Easy to find with plenty of parking. Be prepared to spend a good few hours to see everything and take some good walking shoes, lots of stairs to go up and down which can be narrow and steep. It is generally a self guided tour but our tour started with one of the staff giving a good over view and explanation of things which is very interesting.There is a lot of history on display but also interactive displays which helps keep it interesting for kids.Very glad we did the visit, the ship at the end has some awesome gifts and items in it. Recommend to everyone",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daz233
40,"It's A ""One And Done"" thing...","...as I learned this after buying a seasons pass. My boys, age 7 and 9 at the time, lost interest after the first visit. Pack a lunch or buy seafood from the nearby market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Crupi
50,History of a great warship,The Battleship USS Iowa is a faithful restoration of one of our greatest warships. A few hours touring this museum ship is time well spent. I hardely recomend this museum for people off ages 10 and up. Lots of steep stairs so this ship is NOT handicapped accessible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jgoldchain
50,History at our feet,"If you are a history person you will enjoy this. The ship has lots of history with WWII and the Korean War. Wear comfortable clothes and sneakers, there us a lot of walking and stair climbing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
50,History Galore,"I have been here twice. It has never been crowded. Friendly staff, informative tour. Located at the pier where the cruise ships go out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveler2020
40,AMERICAN BATTLESHIP,"Nothing like the site of a WW2 legend! Nothing like 16"" guns!!!!!The self guided tour is nice and informative with good docents to share info.Tour is above decks only and would be nice if and when they open up the below deck area so tourists can see what makes a battleship click.The engine room would be awesum as well as the engineering spaces",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191keithg
40,Beatiful and very informative,"I was there with friends. We bought the ticket for 19 dollars each, although it is possible to buy combos for the Aquarium or Queen Mary for a reasonable price. The complete tour took about 2 - 3 hours. There is a lot of historical information about the battleship. Some TVs were at a low volume thus it was difficult to understand some informational videos. Besides that, there were a lot of information about the history of the ship and the ship itself is very impressive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pauloandreh
20,Call first to see if generator works!,"Have toured many naval warships in the past. Was very disappointed today when we arrived at the USS Iowa and were told we could only tour the ship above deck due to no electricity for lighting. The on-board generator had failed and not just for a short time but for our entire visit. Don't know if it ever was fixed before they closed at 500pm. Had already purchased our tickets online to save a few bucks and our schedule didn't allow for coming back on another day. I know things break and so we made to best of the bad situation. We were pleased with seeing the ship's bridge, the big guns and peeking in when we could. We were told they are planning to connect the ship to reliable electric power from shore in the future but that is still a long way off. So my advice is to call the USS Iowa in advance before you drive all the way to Long Beach to make sure they have power. We couldn't even buy a T shirt since the Gift Shop was below decks. Lucky the rest rooms were located above deck with the doors propped open for sunlight from outside. Hope the situation is fixed for the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75dave
40,National Treasure,"Great site, great staff, fantastic restoration.Toured the USS Iowa with some 10,000 other Hawkeye fans. There was a small group of alumni band members playing the Iowa songs and National Anthem- awesome!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jimmy_Benson
50,ships,We did the tour which was excellent - I loved how they honor all the veterans - take a moment to ask them about their service - very clean - informative - lots of history on this ship -the guide keep it interesting for the kids & adults by keeping them engaged w/ questions - make you think about what it was really like to be on this ship espcially during war time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/34suea
50,Great Ship!!,"My family and I visited the ship during our LA vacation to the RoseBowl. Visiting the ship made me very proud !! What a fantastic ship. Built to last and conquer. The volunteer staff at the USS Iowa were very friendly, accommodating, and perfect host. A visit to the USS Iowa is a must for any historian.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833travelguy
50,Go Hawkeye's,"My wife and I visited the Iowa on the same day as the ""whole state of IOWA"" was there for the Rose Parade. Glad we arrived early! I think we were the only ones not from Iowa on the ship. Everyone was wonderful (including the fans).The tour of the ship was VERY special. Great flow of the history and sites on the ship. The hosts on board were very helpful and full of history to share. This is a great visit for families with kids. They will think it is COOL.There are some stairs to go up and down to the different floors of the ship but there is user friendly ways to get around the stairs.Parking was a breeze and the visit was truly 5*.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanmS4115LW
40,Awesome Experience,"We came to the battleship along with thousands of other Iowans to celebrate the Hawkeyes, and don't regret it. Make sure you download the app for a self-guided tour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AinsleeB
50,Made this vet VERY proud to be an American!,"As an Iowan & a Viet Vet, I found this link to WWII so very rewarding (especially with 2 WWII vets present the day we visited to share their experiences with us) A fair amount of climbing if you wish to see the entire ship but worth every effort to spend a couple hours here. The volunteers were enthusiastic and the view of the commercial harbor is superb!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36geralde
50,Hawkeye Pep Rally,"What a treat! Although we showed up at the same time 10,000 other Iowa Hawkeye fans showed up we were willing to wait for the opportunity to see such a wonderful ship. The veterans who guided us around were helpful and friendly despite the overwhelming crowd. It was a lovely day! And we learned a lot about the history of the battleship named in honor of our state, Iowa! Go Hawks !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/205erical
50,An Amazing party!,we went to the ship to celebrate Iowa being in the Rose Bowl. The ship and it's docents were amazing hosts and it was a great party. Ship has a lot to offer anyone wanting to tour it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/43sherryk
40,Well worth the time,"This is a great ship and well worth the time to visit. It's clearly a labor of love but we all found the 2 hours spent on-board to be worthwhile. It's a self guided tour with stops along the way with either signs to read or you can download their app and it provides info as you move about the ship.It's not ADA compliant as one might expect.... It's a warship built in WW-II. You might trip.Yes, it shows it's age but I never once thought the detracted from the tour.The only disappointment is the tour does not go past the radio room. I'm sure there are many amateur radio operators on tours who would like to see that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/136bobl
50,One Awesome Battleship!,"This is a self guided tour utilizing flat screen tv's in various locations and Bluetooth through a cell phone app. The tour takes you up and down ladders on all the above water decks. Unfortunately, it doesn't take to the lower decks. I'm not sure if this is normal, but on our visit there were no docents to answer questions. Still it was a very cool tour. I recommend it to everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rickcP3881CU
50,Amazing ship with great guides.,"As soon as you walk on the ship, you get the impression that it has been restored with love and pride. Great info along the way, and well worth a visit.Very interesting talking to knowledgeable staff along the way!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TimberNZ
50,Very interesting,Several comments about no guided tour. For the first part there were a number of docents explaining and giving information. It made the visit very interesting. The stories they told made me laugh and cry some. (This ship ferried our POWs back from Japan).

50,Great piece of history,"Battleship Iowa was one of the ships that arrived in Japan for the surrender ceremony which concluded World War II (although the actual signing of the surrender document took place on the Missouri). While it saw service during the Korean War, it basically was a training ship, until it became a museum ship in 1990 and was parked here. The tour of the Iowa was very well thought-out as a sections were marked so you could see the highlights of the vessel without doing a lot of backtracking.The brochure we were given had a dozen specific things to look for, listed in the order as the tour unfolded. We started at the front of the ship, where the six of the nine 16-inch guns were, and then worked our way inside. At various times we’d go up or down interior or exterior stairs following the prescribed route. This allowed us to see areas which had been set aside with mementos of the Iowa’s life, including pictures and some short films.One amenity this battleship has which no other does was the inclusion of a bathtub. This was installed prior to FDR’s 1943 meeting with Churchill and Stalin in Teheran. Since the Iowa had the job of ferrying the President to this meeting, it needed to outfitted for his convenience.The tour of the Iowa was physically challenging, and could pose some issues to those not use to it. This was a battleship after all, so obstructions in the hallways (to be able to close off sections), narrow staircases, and such were the norm. Wear comfortable shoes before coming, and keep in mind this is not handicap accessible (although there may be some future modifications to change that).This was a great piece of history to be experience, and we were able to complete a thorough walk-through before lunch. It wasn’t that hot or humid when we were there, so keep that factor in mind when making your journey there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/471davem
50,FANTASTIC FROM STEM TO STERN !!!!,This ship is a floating history lesson. They are doing a fantastic job of restoration. Be SURE to wear comfortable shoes and bring a jacket if it's cool. There are many ladders( stairs for you land lovers!) so be prepared for climbing. I wish more folks (not just Navy veterans like myself) would visit places like this. Remember this museum receives NO government support . I urge you to make a donation and help them in their mission to restore and maintain this important piece of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/one_aceracer
50,Humbling,"Take time to sit and listen to those who have experienced the journey. Vets who have a true story of history to share. Learn how they launched jets. Visit every part of the ship. It will take some time so plan on it. Wear comfortable and safe shoes, bring a sweater if it is cooler weather. The Docents are all experienced Navy men. Bring the kids it is a wonderful experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britneylynne2015

A docent made the event with detailed descriptions of the Iowa's role in WW II, Korea and Viet Nam.We saw gun facilities, navigation, eating and sleeping quarters. Would have liked to see the engine area/propulsion and radio room. We should have allowed more time to spend in the museum area near the gift shop. That deserves one-half hour or more.Thanks to all the volunteers with their untold effort to preserve this ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K6KN
40,Awesome,My wife and I had a great time today on the battleship Iowa. We had the most awesome guide today his name was Roger Gillette. He served on that ship and explained so much to us.

40,An amazing journey back to a time when wars were fought without computers.,"By today's standards, everything on this ship looks quite primitive...no computers, no air-conditioning, cramped sardine style bunkbeds, and steep staircases and ladders (no way would they pass ship building codes today!), A tour makes one really appreciate what our previous generation had to put up with to protect us. A self guiding tour takes about 45-60 minutes to complete...there is much to read as you walk about the ship. One sees the bunkbeds (you can get in them to see how they feel), cafeteria area, captains quarters, among other things. There is plenty of parking ($2 per hour). There is also a gift shop and museum...no food except for frozen ice cream bars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob

40,Well Worth the Visit,If your a military / history buff - this is a great place to visit. Very well maintained ship and the self guided tour is easy. This wouldn't be for someone who had physical limitations though as there are space limitations and going between decks could be difficult for some people. Be prepared to spend a minimum of a couple of hours. There is ample parking very close. We were there in the off season on a Sunday and saw very few people on board so it seemed we had the ship to ourselves which made it nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidmP7608YO

40,Beautiful Old Ship,"The Iowas are stately vessels and the Association is doing a good job of preserving this example (a portion of the teak deck was being replaced when I was there). The well-marked tour takes one from the bridges (admiral and captain's) to one deck below the main deck. One wishes the engineering spaces were open, but perhaps that will come in time. Opening a turret or two would further enhance the experience. The purist in me also wishes these ships had not suffered modernization in the 1980s. Gone are the 40mm and 20mm AA guns and four of the 5/38 mounts. The ship is easy to find; the directions on the website (which, because of Trip Advisor rules, you must find yourself) are very clear and street signs lead you to the pier. My slow tour took two hours and was well worth the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfessorTom
40,"Great time, but limited access","Great self-guided tour, but limited access. I've been on other naval ships, and this was the most restricted. No access to lower decks.

We were very well informed by workers on the ship of it's history in transporting President Roosevelt to the famous Tehran meeting in preparation for D day.

The service they rendered this country time and again was exemplary in all instances. Many sailors called her ""home"" and served her well!! The ship has been well restored and in her silence she still is an incredible example of what this nation can accomplish when necessary. When we have the will to excel there is no enemy this country can't defeat!! The weapons system i.e. 16""/50 cal guns are the finest war machinery crafted at the time.

50,A Most Unique Theater,"The LA / OC area offers many unique venues for viewing movies. By far the USS Iowa in San Pedro has to be every top five list. Check the Iowa's webpage for their listing of community events - quite often they feature a movie night. The most recent one was for the movie Jumanji, I took my 15 year old son and his friend. The movie though was not the star of this show. Both boys were absolutely amazed by the immense size of the guns on the fore and aft deck of this warship. It may help to mention that both these boys are also avid players of an online game called World of Warships.We did not tour the battleship - our plan was simply to walk the deck prior to the start of the mostly free movie - $2 an hour for parking (first hour free) and reasonably priced snack were offered. The little bit we did get to see left us longing to return on the near future. In fact, we are hoping to use the venue for a gathering of players of the online World of Warships game.The movie screen was rather small, I think it was a 4'x8' piece of tile board. It was large enough though for the size of the crown and space, The real attraction was sitting on the deck, peering out over the railing and watching cargo ships enter the harbor or be loaded at a side dock. A warm evening also made the experience all the more enjoyable.Though perhaps not the best venue for some, I thought that it made for a rather unique evening of fun. Be sure to take a comfortable chair and perhaps a light coat or blanket if you get cold easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/355edwardg

50,WOW!,"Seldom do you get a chance to feel like you're part of history, but on a recent visit to the USS Iowa moored at San Pedro, that's exactly what we experienced.The WWII battleship has been meticulously restored to her glory days by a host of dedicated volunteers who are the very same folks who give you a friendly welcome on your arrival and provide you with every kind of detail about the Iowa you could ever hope to find.The tour was magnificent and the ship is more than impressive. We will likely never see another quite like it in our lifetimes. The displays and videos are extremely well done and very informative.So I urge you, if you are ever in the Los Angeles/Long Beach area, to visit the USS Iowa. It is truly one of the most historic and memorable tours you will ever take.Kudos to all those who made this possible and continue to pass along this important piece of American and Naval History.

50,A great time,"My wife, 10 yr old daughter, and I visited this ship on a Saturday afternoon. We purchased tickets which allow entrance to the ship and added a 45 minute harbor cruise at a nearby dock (I would recommend NOT getting the cruise). Upon boarding, a volunteer welcomed U.S. and asked our daughter if she would like to find the mascot (Vickie). This is a nice thing for the kids because it makes them look around the ship and not at their electronic devices while aboard. I found the tour to be great. The volunteers shared great information. Lots of fun pictures. A pleasure to be on board this ship!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeepers_Mimi

50,Big Stick - Grey Ghost!,"Looking at the profile of this battle wagon, you can immediately see why she is called the 'Grey Ghost'. Standings under the 16-inch guns it is easy to see why Iowa is called 'The Big Stick'. The only Iowa-class battle wagon to serve in both the Atlantic and Pacific in World War Two. The battleship that carried Fdr on his journey to meet with Churchill and Stalin in Tehran (1943) and therefore the only battleship (naval ship?) to be outfitted with a bathtub and an elevator. Open 10 am to 4 pm. Parking is plentiful and $2 per hour. Admission just for the Iowa is $18 per adult, $10 per child. In combination with the Queen Mary it is $36 per adult. Check their website for details. Allow 2-hours for either a complete self-guided, or a docent tour. The earlier a you come, the better your tour will be! You will primarily see main deck spaces, including enlisted and officer berthing, crew and officer messes, the bridge, navigation spaces and other areas. The displays depicting life aboard are the best I have seen, and I am a member of the Friends of the USS Midway! There is an excellent Gift Shop area, and while there is no Cade, there are vending machines. Get there by going south on either the 110 (Harbor) freeway or 710 (Long Beach) freeway to the short California Freeway 47, the Seaside Freeway. Get off at exit 1-C, and go south on N. Harbor Drive. USS Iowa will be on your left. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etweeden
50,Must visit for history buffs and World War II enthusiasts.,"I pretty much stumbled upon this landmark and was very glad I did. This is the best of the battleships America ever built and was the flagship of the Navy in its time. It was a Monday and pretty much all of the Museums in LA were closed. That is how I ended up buying a ticket online for the Battleship Iowa. The drive from LAX to the San Pedro harbour took around 30 mins that morning.The tour of this historic battleship is self-guided and lasts around 2 hours. You will find the ship dotted with volunteers who serve as guides. One of them was kind enough to take us on a tour of pretty much the entire battleship.On this tour, you get to learn about significant events in World War II that America was part of. You also get to learn a lot about warfare of that time period.Wear comfortable shoes and clothes that don't lift up in the wind as you will be climbing some steps, some of which are steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMounika

50,Great Museum,"The USS Iowa is the lead ship of four Iowa Class battleships completed during World War II by the United States Navy. She is also the last of these four sister ships to find a permanant home as a museum and a tribute to those who served on her. Not only were the Iowa class ships the fastest battleships ever built by any navy, they were the most balanced. The closest competitor in size and power were the contemporary Japanese Yamato class, which displaced more tonnage so they were larger, (although the Iowas were longer) and had 18.1 inch guns compared to the 16 inch guns on the Iowa. However, Iowa and her sisters fired projectiles that came close to matching Yamato in penetrating power, and in addition had better quality armor plate, protective systems, damage control, maneuverability, superior radar and fire control so that in a one-on-one engagement the Iowas would most likely have triumphed, had that ever come about. It is not just about size and inches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/233yik
50,Wow,"Never been on a Battleship before.The self guided tour is confusing at time with yellow arrows and other guide arrows, sometimes pointing in different directions! Please note you will not go below the main deck, in the main you stay up top. You don't go into the turrets, or the magazines or engine room. This is not a tour like HMS Belfast.However, this is because the U.S. Navy can recall this ship at 72 hrs notice to the fleet until 2020. The group looking after the ship are very enthusiastic and have served onboard and have stories to tell.If you are into Naval history this is a must see.Car parking is in site and costs $2 an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vfrphil

My husband's Grandad was on a supply ship in the S pacific during WWII, so with our family history, we were especially interested in the experience of seeing WWII-era boat first hand. The history is fascinating, lots of the ship is open to the public and we enjoyed this very much. They take cheesy photos at the beginning and try to sell them to you to raise funds, but we didn't fee there was excessive pressure. We googled coupons online and got 20% off.

30,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"We visited the USS Midway in San Diego last year and since my husband is a disabled Navy veteran and spent his entire service time on various ships, we were anxious and excited to tour the USS Iowa. We were very disappointed in the tour in comparison to the USS Midway tour. There were no headphones to listen too for a self guided tour, not enough signs around to even give you information about the ship or what you were looking at. Since my husband had been on a lot of naval ships, he was able to tell me a lot on the tour but individuals who are not familiar with a ship would be out of luck. This ship isn't getting the respect it deserves. The hardest part for us was trying to find the ship. The directions are terrible. It is located in such a congested area that you don't even see it there. We drove right by it twice and didn't even see it. Also took us forever to find the parking lot. We spent an extra day in Los Angeles just to go see this ship and we felt like it was a total waste of our time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindaj115
50,5+ points,"I didn't go to the IOWA, but I really wanted to. Unfortunately I was with my wife and son, and trying to get them to go see something historic and a great learning experience is torture. Much like eating grits.However, I have seen both the ALABAMA & NEW JERSEY, and since they are all sister ships, I know the IOWA is also AWESOME!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JOHNRECERT
50,USS Iowa visit,I highly recommend this tour to everyone. Its in a very nice area. The ship is a historic treasure and is well worth the tour. Very reasonable cost for tours and parking. The tours are well organized and you get to tour all the important areas of the ship. Lots to do on weekends as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottmU5374MW
50,A revisit to the Big Stick,The ship has grown in excellence since it was recommissioned as a museum in 2012. A visitor can enjoyably learn how mighty this massive assembly of weaponry and supporting equipment did its job. The knowledgeable volunteers take pleasure in preserving the ship along with informing the visitors about how the ship performed so well during five wars or conflicts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/202leog
50,Best day of the trip,Awesome day at the Iowa. We planned to go for a couple of hours but stayed all day. Former crewmembers told us great stories. Can't wait to come back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnh713
50,Awesome experience!,As a former crewmember I was very impressed with the condition of the ship and the experience the Pacific Battleship Center has created. Bravo zulu!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmJ3541YB
40,Advice for those with mobility challenges,"I have trouble navigating steep ramps and stairs. The Battleship USS Iowa has both.To get to the deck of the battleship, you climb a steep ramp. There is a railing to assist you. There is a well-done self-guided tour that takes you on many levels of the ship, meaning lots of steep stairs. The tour wiped me out, but it was well worth it!There are no elevators, so people in wheelchairs and walkers would have a lot of difficulty moving about.We want to take the grandkids to see this great ship, but I think I'll sit on the first deck while Grandpa and the grandkids do all the climbing.There were many friendly and knowledgeable docents on the ship. If you were to stay on the main deck, you could sit near a docent and hear his stories.There are various ticket packages. One package includes admittance to many of the local attractions. We'll definitely take advantage of this next time we visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lepha
50,Go early and get a more personal tour,"There's plenty of positive reviews of this attraction and I echo the sentiment of all those reviews. The Iowa is a great exhibit and it's well worth the visit. My experience was that if you can get there before it opens, on a week day, so you're in the first group of people on board, you'll get a very nearly personal tour. The guides are fresh first thing in the morning and are enthusiastic. You'll be in a small band of maybe four or five people as you get to each guide IF people are interested. In my case I had one-to-one time with almost every tour guide and had great conversations with all of them. This meant the guides could go off-script and give you more information than they might if a large group was present.One thing I found out later that wasn't mentioned : the ship is still kept in a ""near ready"" state. In theory, with a 16 week lead time, the Iowa could be a fully functional battleship again. I thought THAT was particularly cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/englishdutchman
50,USS Iowa (BB-61) visit the great battleship,"I wanted to visit the Battleship Iowa for a long time, but the years just slipped by. Finally made a reservation and toured the famous battleship. The retired sailors gave an excellent presentation of the functionality and interesting installations on this huge behemoth. One of the gun turret had an explosion in 1989 and we found a far relative with the same last name as ours among the killed. My little boy even had tears.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hanyecz
50,Worth the trip,"Amazing experience.Was a long drive to get there, but definitely worth the trip.I took my partner here as a kind gesture because all I've been doing whilst being here is shop.Was initially disappointed because filming was taking place and a lot of sections on the battleship was roped off so I would say maybe call ahead and see whether filming will be taking place so that you can really browse and see everything it has to offer.Overall my partner was really impressed with everything and was glad that we made the trip out to see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellieyngu

Learned a bunch of unknown things that one can only find out if seeing it first hand. Be careful when using the stairways. Your head will get a bump if you are a tall person.Would have liked to see the engine room . But the tour did not include it.Did set in the Captains chair That was a +Took all kinds of pictures.It's not a guided tour, Just stroll at your own pace and enjoy itParking was a breeze and inexpensive.Vending machines for sodas.Bought the ships pictures with background.

50,USS Iowa,"Our first stop -- on our vacation, we flew out, from SC, specifically to tour the Ship of Presidents... Walking, where so many Presidents walked... Appreciating the history and the place in history that this ship has. We are so thankful and proud of those who served on the Iowa...we were not disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/740marilync
50,An amazing place to explore history,"This is the second Iowa class battle ship I've toured and this was a treat. Because you could tour at your own pace, it was possible to stop and read, explore and browse at your leisure. My wife and I both love ships and the ocean. The Iowa perfectly satisfied both loves. We watched small boats cruise past, watched containers being loaded on ships across the harbor and toured a living piece of history, all at the same time. Take your time and read historic documents, the notes describing the history of the ship and her voyages and notes about all the things this ship has done, from her days in World War 2 up through the 1980s. One of the highlights of the tour was being able to talk to people who had actually served on not only the Iowa but other ships of this, and other, classes. These folks brought history itself to life. Be prepared to walk, climb and learn, all in a wonderful environment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/634perryl
40,Very cool,"Our family, which includes our 3 sons, ages 15- 20, loved touring this ship. The guys really thought the guns and torpedo launchers were cool.The history factor- seeing where big deals were made by the big people of that time.It's was a cool and interesting visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/180cyndyg
50,Fun time,"The ship was cool, it was a fun time. Lots of history with real war hero's! We enjoyed the day with great Access to most areas of the ship. I would recommend",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tugboatguypdx
50,Nothing else like it in the region,"Not only is the USS Iowa a true rarity, its tremendous combination of a long active history and a significant number of living crew members allows for a very thorough and interactive experience. Being able to not only see how the great battleship operated, but also hear stories about its actual use is an experience that would be hard to replicate. Very much worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belgonzo
50,Great visit,My family had a great visit at this amazing battleship. You can feel the power and history while you are on board.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400juanv
50,Remembering American Heroism,My husband had this as a bucket list item. The ship is quite imposing. Volunteers welcomed us aboard and gave us information at various stations on the ship to help us understand the ship's unique history and capabilities. The ship was altered to accommodate President Franklin Roosevelt encounter to plan invasions with our allies. I was struck by how dedicated the volunteers are to keep the ship in peak condition. I left with increased pride and respect for our Navy. There is a nice gift shop on board and you have the option of having pictures of you aboard the Iowa with guns blazing! A nice stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/442jeanninel
50,"One of Americas Iconic warships, up close and personal!",Very interesting and educational look at a piece of Americas naval history!

50,Best thing we saw during Tall Ships Festival,"Our original plan was to see the Tall Ships Festival. A co- worker recommended we go see the Iowa, which ended up being the best thing we saw. Just to get a taste of how our military who was assigned there was fascinating. For example, one area showed what the table settings with the plate ware, glasses, cups, and silverware was neat. Or to see how cramped the shipmates' bunks were like compared to one of the officer's quarters is a study of contrasts.One in our party was fascinated with a mechanical ""computer"" of its day. In fact, he told an acquaintance who is a math professor, who in turn was impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Penguinblue57
40,Go during normal hours,We went over after it was closed but we could still talk to people about the ship and go part way up the entrance. Very interesting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califdrm

50,Great battleship museum,"The Iowa is a great WWII-era battleship museum, and is a must for anyone interested in maritime warfare. The main attractions are the 16"" main batteries - really big guns! There's a lot of stair climbing, so this museum can be difficult for the elderly or disabled, but the main batteries are accessible to all. Great place to learn about American sea-power!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avipiti
50,WWII Battle Wagon is a Treasure,"The mighty IOWA is a living memorial to the greatest conflict in the history of mankind - & a memorable tribute to American fighting men (& women.) Only a few of these battleships remain to be viewed by all in awe. Perfect for families w kids, couples or singles. Get the feel of this sleek warrior of American history, and then pop down to see the nearby 'Queen Mary' & then the many sights of Long Beach. Well worth a 2 hors visit...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
40,"A fine battleship of its era, well preserved, in a picturesque location at the Los Angeles Harbor (Port of Los Angeles)","If you're into WW2 history, or military ships, this is a great tour through a fine mid 20th century battleship. Allow at least an hour to walk quickly through the entire walking tour route, better yet, allow for 2 hours so you have time to stop along the route, looking at the various rooms, posts, and weapon stations, take photos, and have some time to browse the gift shop on the exit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasH_traveling
40,Father's Day Treat,"I'm not a Navy guy, but I've always been fascinated by naval ships. The USS Iowa is a great, up close look at a WWII battleship. Even on Father's Day the crowd was not overwhelming (which was great). Many ex-Navy ""docents"" were available to talk about the ship and their experiences. It's all self guided, but the docents are more than willing to talk with you. A couple of videos are playing at various locations to give some historical perspective. Stayed just under 2 hours and that seemed to be perfect. Get tickets online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtlerman

50,Loved it!,"I had never been inside a battleship so when I found about this ship I knew I had to go! It didn't disappoint. I explored all sections of the ship and even met a WW2 veteran who served in the Pacific which made my first time here even better. It was a really surreal experience- to think that you are on an actual battleship is just indescribable. They've really taken care of the ship and gift shop is nice as well. They've got a lot of WW2 memorabilia such as cups, posters, shirts, copies of newspaper articles that were making headlines at the time, and other material that have WW2 images such as Rosy the Riveter and the like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blaugrana10
50,"Great historical site, fun with tweens","I spent close to 3 hours here with my 11 and 13 year olds. Very well organized, self-conducted tour (they do have guides who provide impromptu tours too). It's a big ship with lots to see and do. I highly recommend this if you are near Long Beach. It's fun and fascinating just driving through one of the largest container ports in the country to get to the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsFromHK

50,Great family day trip,Nice to travel back in the past of what life is like on a Battleship. Self walking tour through the ship and up on the deck. Great for all ages. Discount for Past and Present Military.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R5750NGevae
30,Midway is Better,"Perhaps it was because it is July 3rd but visit was not as hoped it would be. They were suppose to ""shoot"" the big guns at 10:30a.m. - no one allowed on the front part of the ship everyone to back - so we waited and waited and finally at 11:30+a.m. they shot the guns (2 shots). I sure hope they weren't this slow when in battle. Afterwards we had to get off and travel back to front to start tour. You follow the arrows difficult traveling the tour route if you are not with a docent because you can't get by. I wouldn't take your kids unless they are really really into battleships. We had our 10 year old grandson and although he had fun on the ""little"" scavenger hunt for the most part he was bored. If you have any walking disabilities this is not for you. Also - buy your tickets on line to avoid a long line with only 2 ticket sellers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LDM52
50,This was coller than I expected,"This is a well put together exhibit, and way better than I expected. Every visitor is a VIP, and every guide is experienced. So much to see, so much to learn! Life on the sea during WWII is well depicted, the history of this vessel is explained in amazing detail, and you can get a feel for what those who served on this ship and those like it experienced while aboard. I didn't really know what to expect, but I certainly got more than I imagined.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/970ralphs

50,History Hands-on!,"The USS Iowa is one of four historic battleships made during WW2. You get to explore about a third of the ship, but it takes two hours to do it! The docents are very knowledgeable and smart. High Heeled shoes are NOT recommended for this venue, as most of the ship has trip hazards if you are not careful. This ship is still in Reserve status until 2020, so some parts are not accessible. (Like the engine room). Well worth the visit! Will return as more of the ship is opened to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hansiundfritz
30,Summer Field Trip,I went with middle school students for our summer school trip. It was everybody's first time. We had the tour led by Roger and Josh and the students learned so much and they enjoyed the activities.

50,Reliving History aboard ship,"Visiting the USS Iowa was a trip down history lane. Exhibits are well done, with photos and other memorabilia arranged. Some people may struggle with the uneven deck and ladders, but if you are agile and able, it is well worth a few hours of your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FatandSassy
50,Military History at it's best.,"The USS Iowa was in World War Two, Korea, during the Coldwar and has been honorably retired to museum status. Having toured other museum ships, I was bound and determined to make the most of it and not be pushed through by other people. I was the first on the ship the day I went. That's the best way to do this.For someone who loves history this was a wonderful experience that is dissifult to describe. I was able to take my time to go through the self-guided tour.Seeing a picture of a 16 inch gun turret and standing next to one are two complelety different things.As I was taking the tour though I noted that the USS Iowa was constructed during World War Two and in commission through the cold war. Many of her ships functions however were not upgraded to modern standards (perhaps they could not be) it was very interesting to see how much 'old' technology was in use and I wondered what those sailors from not that many years ago must have thought when using brass, non-electronic equipment in the the age of computers. Fascinating to see.Two final things to note..#1. There are two barrels where for a voluntary donation of $5 you can have a piece of wood that comes from the deck of the Iowa. You can see where these come from as the walkways are covered with plywood most of which comes from the forward turret areas. Later, I realized that much of the wood in these barrels is damaged, as if by fire. Then I remembered the explosion of one of the 16"" guns of the Iowa in 1989. The wood is obviously from deck around the area of that explosion. People died there, and then it all becomes real.#2. I have at my home a solid brass US Navy speaker that much I knew. I was able to see the exact same speaker (although a slightly more modern version, say 1950's). The rumor was that it came off a battleship but I was happy to be able to confirm the type.USS Iowa is something that should not be missed if you are a history buff of any type.Finally, spend the extra $4 and get the ticket that let's you into all the other attractions in the area and then walk the waterfront. It's a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/creeker000
50,So much to see,"This is a very good way to spend a few hours or even more.It is also very hard on the legs, but worth every step. A visit that will keep kids and older kids ( up to 90 years ) happy and for some bring back memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikedb49
40,Plenty of history on show.,"The Battleship Iowa is an amazing experience for anyone who has never visited a naval warship. It features weaponry that was used during WWII and the Korean War. Unfortunately there are no fitted examples of the 40 mm and 20 mm guns that were part of the original armament because these were removed in the 1980's during the re-fit when re-commissioned for further service. The film showing the loading and firing of the 16"" guns is excellent and explains the complicated process very clearly. It must have been an awesome experience to witness these mighty guns being fired.Handling munitions can be dangerous as the memorial to the 47 crew members killed by an explosion in turret 2 in 1989 shows.There are plenty of compartments that are not accessible to visitors and it is hoped that these e.g. engine and boiler rooms, magazines, 16"" turrets and medical centres, will open in the future.Access is easy and there is plenty of parking (charges apply) nearby.Cannot imagine any visitor will be disappointed by their visit and perhaps like me will hope to return to see and learn more about life on BB 61.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobbieBStockport

40,"A great addition to the San Pedro waterfront, and sure to only get better with time!","The USS Iowa is a living piece of history and we are thrilled that she now calls San Pedro home. The ship is easy to access and close to the 110 freeway offramp and immediately adjacent to the cruise ship terminal in the LA Harbor. Be prepared to climb ladders and steep gangways - the ship, except for the maindeck area and fantail, is not handicapped accessible.The existing tours do not include access to the engine room, and hopefully this will change in the future. Much of the ship is still being prepared for visitors/tours, but the bridge, battle center, guns, and many common spaces are open and ready to be explored. Food and beverage options on board are very limited, but that's not a bad thing, since there are tremendous restaurants in downtown San Pedro (6th Street) and Ports of Call, both just a few blocks walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SACNORAD
50,Iowa Class Battleship,"A beautiful old ship. This class was the last of its kind. It is amazing that all four of this class are all museums. The stories these ladies could tell. Most likely the most lethal battleships of all time, The fire control system was state of the art and that gave it the edge over the two IJN Yamato Class ships.Parking was close but you have to go up and down steep stairs. My imagination was going wild to imagine what it was like to be on the ""Big Stick"". Being on the bridge and looking over the bow several hundred feet in front of you is awesome.We are so lucky this ship made it to the museum rather than the breakers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawkeyeDon

40,Battleship USS Iowa is a local treasure,"We brought my parents and children (ages 14, 12, and 10) to the USS Iowa yesterday for their self guided tour. While it is much smaller than the USS Midway in San Diego, it is worth visiting. To learn about the history of the ship and the bravery of the men who served on it, was a wonderful experience. The tour only takes a couple of hours and is very interesting. I recommend a visit for anyone looking for a couple hour activity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kurin
50,Good explanations,"I have visited quite a few warships over time. They have volunteer guides usually, as this one does an that is a big part of the enjoyment listening to their stories.

This ship is actually floating not affixed to bottom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O1307WIpeterr

My stepdad served on the towa during WW II, & had some wonderful stories about his time aboard this beloved battleship. While in the South Pacific, it was almost two years before he stepped foot on land. He was only 17, single, quite a prankster, & a handsome ladies man! The first port after two years, was Honolulu. Twenty years later, my mother found a box of photos & cards from at least a dozen gorgeous Hawaiian girls! Obviously, he enjoyed his time on the island!?!?

You'll see the room where Roosevelt stayed on his way to the Tehran Conference. Your kids will be entertained by a silly ""find the dog picture"" game while you have time to read the exhibits. It's well done and not too crowded when we visited. A volunteer told us that even more will be open soon, and they already have quite a bit of the ship open for touring.

40,All Ages!,"Need to see and visit this boat! A piece of history that played a role in multiple wars. The volunteers are very friendly and knowledgeable about the ship. Knowing that maintenance rely on donations, it's good to be a part of it. When you're in the boat, you can't help but imagine what's it feels like being in the navy.

40,A PRECIOUS PIECE OF WWII HISTORY,"It's a joy to see a piece of WWII history preserved and cherished in San Pedro, California. The USS IOWA survived WWII and now is a living history museum. President Franklin Roosevelt traveled on the USS IOWA and a bathtub was installed in the ship since the president was disabled due to polio and could not stand. Here's your chance to see the tub where Roosevelt bathed. It's the only bathtub on a warship we were told.This is a beautiful ship that has been restored to its finest. Step back in time and imagine the soldiers in WWII.I visited on Memorial Day and unfortunately, the overwhelming crowds took a lot away from the experience. This is a self-guided tour and the line literally snaked through the ship. It reminded me of a slow moving line at Disneyland. Staff members urged us to keep the line moving through the ship so it was hard to take pictures or even read the few informational signs. I got the impression that maybe on a less crowded day, volunteers would be giving out historical information. I heard one staff member telling a volunteer to keep the line moving and he made it clear that they were not slowing down the line to give any talks or information. Sadly, there were no facts or talks given because the line had to keep moving.The ship is beautiful and fascinating and it should be noted that only the upper levels are open. The tours do not go below deck but do go through the fighting and operational portions of the ship. The decks are flat but you will need to climb up and down steep ladder steps--only a few steps. Some people walked down backwards or just were extra careful. Once in line, there was no way to leave and no bathroom facilities on the ship. Be sure to visit the facilities near the ticket booth before entering the ship.The gift shop is full of pricey treasures. Again, it was too crowded to really have a good look at the shop. $25 t-shirts. The cashiers did ask if we wanted to donate $15 for a care package for a soldier and also if we wanted to round up our purchase to the next dollar. Also, as you enter, your picture is taken and you can opt to pay $20 for a small print or $30 for a large print. On the way out, it was suggested we give a $5 donation. I understand the need to raise money to support the ship, but the commercial aspect and prices were surprising.A national holiday will guarantee large crowds so if you like a quieter time, try another day. I imagine the tour took 4 times longer on Memorial Day and there was no time to read the signage or get information from the enthusiastic volunteers that other reviewers have mentioned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackbear
30,Floating Military History,"I've been to the New Jersey (as a kid) and now the Iowa and glad that I did. I wanted to experience just how big these fighting ships really are. I'm amazed how well preserved the boat is and can see the work that is being done to preserve it (aft deck being replaced with new wood, looks amazing). When visiting don't bring anything with you except a camera as the cramped spaces may cause issues if you bring a bag.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/191joshg
50,treasure of history,"The volunteers showing off the ship are to be commended. Their love for their ship and country is obvious. There was a tower where men loaded the Big Guns. They showed the renovations made for Roosevelt's wheelchair. The room at the end had placards with tons of fascinating facts about WWII ships. Of course there was a shop and a family photo shot. Very interesting. No bathrooms on board, so porta potties outside (bring hand sanitizer). Was worth the price of admission. A good tour would be between 2 and 3 hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7seekers
50,Getting Better All the Time,"I first went aboard the Iowa when it was in Richmond, CA getting ready to make the trip to Los Angeles. After it arrived in LA, I became a ""CPO Plank Owner."" Since then I have visited the Iowa on more than a dozen occasions. Most recently, met up with nine of my friends and personally took them on a tour. There are sections of the ship opening up all the time. It is a work in progress and it just keeps getting better and better. My hats off the all the devoted volunteers who have brought this great ship back to life. Hooyah!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Military History~ Hands On,"Great restoration, thoughtful history and for history buffs, especially naval or military history, if you are in Southern California, this is a MUST SEE! Clean, accessible, knowledgeable staff, beautiful setting in San Pedro. Don't miss this gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ERINLAW
50,Great Trip! !!,"This was a fantastic trip!! I took my two young girls& they really enjoyed the trip. The tour takes anywhere from 2-6 hours depending on your interest in history. Purchase your tix online before going. They can be purchased on the USS Iowa website & save some money - unless you are a Vet - yours is discounted at the door. ... the Chamber of Commerce has a booth at the front of the ship. They hand out pamphlets which contain dining options around San Pedro near the USS Iowa. The pamphlet has coupons for 15% off most locations. Stop by, pick up a pamphlet, chat with the attendant, and save some money. Overall, this was a fantastic trip! It was well worth every penny I spent. Do yourself a favor, and make this a stop the next time you are in San Pedro. You will not regret it. Great job by the staff of the USS Iowa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChargerFan78
50,Enjoyable,There is a lot of pride from the group of people that are working on restoring this ship. We really enjoyed our two hours of walking around and learning the history of the Iowa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lopsid
40,Veteran's Day,"Great site to brush up on your military history. Fun activities for kids that keeps their interest and makes learning fun. Couldn't resist the touristy photos, they're kinda cheesy but super fun and a great memento from a fun afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5343JKsusans
50,The (nearly) last battleship,"The lead ship in the 4-vessel class of fast battleships, Iowa served the US Navy for more than 60 years. She's been permanently moored just south of the Los Angeles cruse ship terminal since 2012. Known variously as ""The Big Stick"" and ""The Grey Ghost,"" Iowa provides a wonderful immersion in the history of US naval warfare. Former sailors acting as volunteer docents are stationed at key points of the self-guided tour, providing more history and personal anecdotes.More people are probably familiar with USS Missouri, a nearly identical sister ship moored in Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and site of the Japanese surrender ceremony that ended World War II. Iowa was in Tokyo Bay that day, too, as Admiral Halsey's flag ship, and I asked why Missouri was chosen for the surrender. The sailor smiled and reminded me that President Harry Truman was from Missouri and suggested I draw my own conclusions.Iowa is not as well preserved as Missouri. The teak on Iowa's main deck is in terrible shape, and is covered by weathered plywood. Efforts are underway to replace it with Douglas fir--not authentic, but a lot cheaper.The tour is fascinating, but only if one can negotiate sometimes steep stairways. Unfortunately the engine spaces are not accessible. We had only two hours to tour before closing time, and it was only just adequate. Plan to stay longer if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TBearden
50,Day Trip,"My wife and I came here on a Tuesday around 1pm. We had a good time using the self guided tour, which is just following the arrows on the deck. Even got a veteran discount when purchasing tickets. Word to the wise there are a lot of stairs and uneven floors. No issues for us but it can be for someone else. All in all, it was a great way to spend the afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErickMiranda
50,US Navy ship is a treasure to be respected,I felt a sense of awe when walking the decks and passages of this grand old ship. Volunteers provided information to us as we walked through the boat. It is a perfectway to learn the history of a mighty craft that served our country and the sailors that sailed her. I would recommend going on a tour if visiting San Pedro. It is a good activity to do if waiting to embark on a cruise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelgJ6056KQ
50,Great battleship!,"The USS Iowa is a very well done battleship museum, you won't want to miss if you are into military history.The self guided tour is well done and informative. It's great to see the big 16 inch guns up close and see just how big the 16 inch shells were. There are a few games the kids can play along the tour. One involves the ships mascot - Vicki the dog from WW2.Other attractions are the more modern phalanx gun system and tomahawk cruise missiles. There is also an information area that tells the history of the ship and dimensions. It's amazing.A couple of drawbacks, you aren't able to go into the turrets or into the engine room as in some other battleshipsOverall it's an attraction that I highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TranzorZ1985
50,A top-attraction for anyone but especially for people interested in military history and heavy steelwork,"When exploring the Los Angeles Harbor we saw the Queen Mary - but at the counter we found out that a much more interesting attraction was nearby: the veteran battleship USS Iowa, in service in many wars between 1942 en 1991 but mostly built for WW-2. Walkoing along the massive gon towers with the huge 16inch (diameter!) barrels, the projectiles, also the bridge and massively armored conning tower (45 cm thickness of pure steel!), the secondary guns, the later added missile lauchers, it was a very impressive experience. It is the largest warship I ever visited! Stronly recommended for visitor interested in military history or just heavy steel. Little minor point is that the engine rooms could not be entered in the self-guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IWNoordergraaf
50,A must see,"San Pedro is home of the USS Iowa, the first of the big gun battleships. If you are a Veteran or military there will be an admission discount. The tour is very easy to follow but beware, there will be many ladders to go up and the down. The tour includes the decks, the guns, as well as the crew and captains quarters. As you stand on the teak decks, it is hard to believe that this ship saw duty in WW II, Korea,Vietnam and Dessert Storm. The volunteers are very helpful and bring the ship to life. The children are given a map to find the ship's dog, Vicky and then receive a gift at the conclusion of the tour. Do keep in mind that this ship tour is not for those who have limited mobility. No strollers, walkers, etc are allowed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathieL798
40,Great Grandkid Day,"Took the grandkids - wow were they impressed! Especailly the 16"" guns that shot a train in motion at 24 miles (even if it was an accident). The ship has only been open for a short while so it is understandably a little limited in where you can go on it (no engine room tour for instance). Otherwise, what a gem! Thanks to all of the volunteers. NO WHEELCHAIRS, LOTS OF STEEP STAIRS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warren_91789
50,4 Dimensional history lesson at it's finest,"One of the few remaining battleships one can view, touch, walk on, and walk into. Experiencing the first 3 dimensions is accomplished by taking in the ship itself. The 4th dimension is the incredible narrative that many of the volunteers are able to communicate to you. Many of the dedicated volunteers served on this ship or ships like it in wars around the globe. There is nothing like walking the decks (this is the prime fundraising goal...to replace the beautiful teak decks), entering the captain's quarters, imagining President Roosevelt on board, looking out over the immense ship from the bridge, or standing under guns that fire projectiles the weight of a volkswagen to bring home the deep history of the USS Iowa. All the while being educated and entertained my loyal seamen volunteers.The ship is loaded with modern weapons systems like the cruise missile launchers, radar guidance and R2D2 Phalanx gun systems. Right along side are the many brute force 5 inch guns that had 14 men packed inside the little turret when firing. The pure engineering of the ship, from the 250 miles of wiring to the almost 900 foot length of the vessel will enamor all visitors young and old.Try to get a tour below...it's another world down there in the engine room with the huge propeller shafts with their candy cane striping to show when they are turning. I was lucky enough to also see the firing computer and the gunnery systems as well. This is not available to all visitors.The greatest generation of all is brought to life, and back to life, on the USS Iowa tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CayeBoy
50,Toured Battleship Iowa after Christmas,"Neat to see and be able to go on a battleship. To bad I didn't know about the Iowa resident discount, but it's alright. We did buy the package to get discount tickets to the pacific aquarium. They had a sheet for kids to answer questions to get a free prize at the end. If you're in the Long Beach area, I recommend seeing this neat part of history!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhastings7
50,This was a real neat tour of the Battleship Iowa - great volunteers!,"Really enjoy touring this old battleship, it was very informative. The volunteers were especially knowledgable in the area they were showing. Glad to have been able to tour this piece of History in our Military Ships that were defending us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403luannh
50,Iowa resident admission.,"I visited around noon on Easter Sunday, April 5th 2015. With GPS and following the signs I found the USS Iowa with no trouble. It was not very busy and parking was not a problem. I believe the 1st hour of parking is free. After that the cost was minimal. At ticketing I was given a complimentary general admission ticket for being a resident of Iowa. Showing an Iowa drivers license and confirming a home zip code. Very nice. After your photo is taken at the green screen you were greeted right away as you boarded the ship. All of the volunteers I met on the ship were wonderful. Questions answered and assistance with getting around, if needed. For the self guided tour you just made your way around, following arrows on the deck or on the walls. Pointing the way you were to tour the ship. It worked out great. The ship is amazing! I had a great time taking pictures and reading as many informational tidbits as possible. Again, it was not busy and I was able to freely move about and take my time. Never feeling like I was being rushed by anyone behind me. I did not spend much time in the gift shop, but that area looked very nice too. I would absolutely visit the USS Iowa if I were in the area again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iowacityia
40,Excellent Family Experience,We went as a family of 8 adults and 4 children and everyone enjoyed the experience. The volunteers on board are a wealth of knowledge about the ship. It was a self paced tour which left us plenty of time to explore all the areas accessible to the public without being rushed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhondap743
40,Great day trip,I went to visit the Battleship with a visiting friend who has a passion for ships. I am not a battleship fan but I really enjoyed this day visit. The ship is awe-inspiring and it was fun exploring and taking in a bit of history. I do recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chantin2015
40,good experience,"we entered a real battleship ! the interior was still old and musky ... they had obviously kept it in a real good condition even after all these years. if you have been on a cruise for vacation, then it would be a good idea to visit this battleship as then you get to know that not all ships offer the same luxuries that you received in the cruises ! ;) SPOILER ALERT = the crew were real officers when they were young ;) they will tell you real stories, its really good :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/831priyankas
50,Awesome,Thank you for sharing and having my family and I onboard. We all learned a lot. The movie in the Theater was a great watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aseretseven
50,Legacy visit,"My Grandfather served on the big stick during WWII. I was moved to tears stepping on deck, I hadn't thought of my grandpa in years until that moment and was so proud to be walking the same halls he walked so long ago. I loved this trip and highly recommend going to see it. The ship is spectacular, and absolutely worth taking a look at. If you go say hi to my grandpa for me, I miss him :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whtmtnboy
50,Ahoy ! Mate.....we loved it !,"We went on Iowa tour because it was part of the ticket that we bought to see the Queen Mary. This is a great tour,,,,,we has so much fun.Lots of walking and claiming up and down the decks.This is a very Historic Ship with lots of famous people that have sailed the sea's on her. There is a movie on board that is a must see........take the time and see it......explains life on the ship and all the wars and travels the ship has had. Its docked on a very beautiful part of Los Angeles called Ports A Call ........lots of places to eat and shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarisaDenver
50,Good Ship worth visiting,"The IOWA is most interesting and has lots to look at it has only been open a couple of years and has a fair way to go on restoration below decks , the staff were most interesting and helpful , well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stretchj2015
50,WOW! What a Feeling!,"Touring this ship gives you the chills,along with a sense of pride and amazement that so many sailors lived and worked together during brutal times to protect our Country. It is absolutely wonderful numerous navy veterans donate their time today to assist visitors with questions and explain a variety of details. They were fascinating and most personable with young and old alike. They are gems!A very special resident once serving on the USS Iowa was a beloved dog of a captain, Vicky, which today is the name of a game for children as they take tour.This tour is beautifully laid out and keeps your curiosity peaked. It takes approx. 1 1/2-2 hours.The refurbishment of the USS Iowa was done with private dollars, not taxpayer dollars. This is an incredible tribute to our history. Thank you to everyone who helped make this possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Condocat
50,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"Our third trip to Anaheim/LA, but our first visit to the battleship. I took my 2 teenagers (16 & 14), and we ended up being on board for over 2 hours! This is an incredible exhibit for everyone. Very well layed out self-guided tour. Lots of volunteers all over the ship to answer questions and provide more insight.The USS Iowa is in the LA harbor. There is a large cruise ship dock on one side, small private boats docked on the other side, and directly across from the battleship are the loading docks for cargo ships. It was fascinating watching all the different vessels coming and going!Warning: There is a lot of walking/climbing on the battleship. The ""stairs"" -- and there are a LOT -- are more like ladders. Not a place for high heels or platform shoes! (I saw no evidence of elevators, so I am not sure if this is wheelchair accessible... check before you visit.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lunchbag917
50,Highlight of our SoCal trip,"This was an unplanned excursion because we got tired of Disney but it turned out to be the highlight of our trip. It was spectacular and NOTHING like we have ever seen before! I loved touring the areas and explaining to my son how all the defenses and armaments worked.This is a fairly modern ship since it last saw service in 1989 and was last retrofitted somewhere in the early 80's under Reagan's re-militarization policies. So all of the smaller cannons were replaced with 4 Raethon Phalnax systems and it was equipped with 32x cruise missle launchers. So the range of this vessel ranges from a few feet to 900+ miles.Anyways, I could have spent double the time here listening to the veterans who gave the tour. I really liked how they honoured current veterans by announcing their name and service when they arrived.Ladies: watch your heels and open toe shoes, you'll likely stub them. Kids - watch your shins going up and down the steep stairs. This attraction is not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickey4264
50,Walk on the decks of American history,"My son and I visited the USS Iowa battleship in Long Beach today with a troop of Navigators--mostly 8 year olds. The Iowa has been open as a museum type attraction for only a few years, but I would recommend it highly.First, the sheer scale of the ship is staggering. The main guns are almost indescribably impressive. We had a docent guiding us, but a self guided tour could be just as rewarding.The ship itself is a work in progress. There are plywood planks in many places rather than the original teak wood decks. Some of the stairways and hatches are difficult to negotiate for those with mobility issues.The attraction here is the breathtaking trip back in our history. The ship fought in WWII and several subsequent American wars, and to stand on the decks and imagine all that history gave me chills.As work continues to renovate the USS Iowa, I'm sure it will become more polished and pretty. My view is that a tour of the ship allows you the rare privilege of walking the same decks as so many sailors and marines that sacrificed so much for all of us to keep this country safe.Take the time to visit the USS Iowa and support the restoration of this important piece of American history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/368dano
40,Top Notch for History Buffs,"If you are a history fan, you really must get on one of the WWII era battleships around the United States. Los Angeles finally has one now in the USS Iowa, and it's great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8386XVjasonc
50,Nice bit of history located in an interesting city of San Pedro,"In the city of San Pedro, near the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports is the WWII battleship IOWA. This low slung ship under-states the massive firepower and destructive force of this fighting vessel. This vessel has recently moved to town is still a work in progress. This self guided tour is not recommended for those with impaired mobility, narrow steep stairs with chain railings. Younger children may not be too thrilled with this tour. There are additional fun things to do in San Pedro on the coast that get very little press.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/276kevinp
40,A great thing to do in Long Beach,The USS Iowa is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The docents are very knowledgable and are very happy to share their knowledge with you. I would certainly recommend a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetL398
50,A Great Piece of History,"This past summer, I spent several hours on a tour of the Battleship Iowa with a group of fellow history teachers. It was a great experience! There is so much history and I was impressed with how much of the ship we were able to see. I strongly encourage history lovers to visit this ship!This ship was the 1st of the Iowa class and saw action mostly during WWII in the Pacific. It was in service from 1943-1949, 1951-1958 and again from 1984-1990. Many changes have been made to the ship to upgrade it to the more current technology. One of the coolest modifications is the elevator and bathtub created to accommodate FDR's visit.There is a scavenger hunt to intrigue kids as they hunt for ""Vicky,"" the dog mascot of this ship. At the end, they can get a sticker for completing the scavenger hunt.There are a lot of stairs so be prepared to get a good workout as the self-guided tour leads you throughout the ship. At the end there is a very nice gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusanM05
40,Went with the Family,"Service veterans provide awesome detail and information. Make a day of it, stop here and in San Pedro. It is an excellent day for locals and a great time for the tourist, especially if you like military history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Whitakerh
50,Not to miss,"It is an impressive warship, self guided tour supported by volunteer veterans telling great stories about the ship. Worth detour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/420teds
40,Enjoyed the History,"Located about 45 minutes from motel. Staffed completely by volunteers and the refurbishing work is all done with donated funds and labor. Self-guided tour, but plenty of signage. Many ship ladders between levels for steps - quite steep, not suited for those with mobility issues. We had several younger children with us and were able to negotiate the steps, but required close assistance from adults. Took about 2 hours for the tour, considering children did not like to spend much time reading signs. Nice gift shop before leaving ship. Tickets cheaper when purchased online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/72craigt
50,WELL WORTH THE TRIP,"Plan a day and go visit the USS Battleship Iowa and the Merchant Marine Ship the S.S. Lane Victory. Both ships have a very rich history. Great for everyone from families to school and other groups to visit. It will take you all day to visit both ships, and be sure to wear close toed shoes. No sandals. Check out Groupon for discount ticket availability.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dawnb843
50,Quite Amazing,What an amazing ship. The guides around the ship are very friendly and knowledgeable. Definitely the highlight of our trip to that area. I highly recommend this stop along the coast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StuB186
40,Great Piece of History,"When we visited, all of the tours hadn't been fully implemented. The tour we took was a great taste of what it would have been like to live/work aboard the ship. The little kids didn't love it as much as I did, but I'll be back by myself to take other tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/longnex
50,Great piece of history,There is so much to see on this amazing boat! The history provided by the volunteers/tour guides are detailed and provide much detail into the operations and places the Iowa has been. Well worth the time spent!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teamGK13

50,Fantastic,my husband just loved this ship and the volunteers were informative and friendly. It was great to be able to walk around at own pace and enjoy the ships essence. Thank you for those men and women who served our country!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/175pattyf
50,Impressive,"This ship is just amazing. No tour, just wander around, loved it. Note it would be difficult for anyone with knee problems, lots of stairs and one has to watch their steps everywhere. Totally worth a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stephanietravelsalot
40,A must see but I expected more...,"The ship is awesome and having the chance of being aboard one of the most famous and powerful battleships ever made is a privilege that I've been very glad to have.The tour is very well arranged and the yellow arrows make it quite easy to go through it. Also the volunteers aboard are VERY friendly and eager to answer all the questions. I had the opportunity to talk with an retired Sub Captain that server during WW2 and we had a very interesting conversation about sub tactics in both pacific and Atlantic theaters!There are also some very good descriptions about the key places on the ship and about the weapon systems around the ship.This is all very good and perhaps more than enough for the everyday visitor but as a battleship fan I felt like a more technical tour would be very nice to have.For instance, I would love to be inside one of the turrets close to the breech of the 16 inch guns, and to see all the mechanisms on the lower decks that were used to hoist the 2700lbs shells and powder bags. Also to see the actual ballistic mechanical computers that were used until the late 80s and were made in the 30s!Also at least a quick pass through one of the magazines and machine rooms would be awesome. These are an engineer marvel that not only the military history fans would appreciate.I don't know if this would be possible but if some day more parts of the ship are open to be explored I'll definitively be there on the 1st line!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sebastians773
50,A testament to WW2,This mighty battleship is a wonder and worth every effort. Just get on your bicycle and take the Metro to Long Beach about 45 mins south of Union Station. Follow directions to the Iowa and you are in for a treat. The way they have restored this iconic battleship is a dream for any seafaring WW2 purist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eumundiward

50,Battleship Iowa,"We toured the ship with three children (ages 4-7), but it was equally great for adults. There must have been 20 volunteer guides to answer questions. It has a challenging game for kids where they have to identify ten places on the ship on a form. They were totally engulfed in that exercise and won prizes at the end. The self-guided tour took two hours and covered four decks and many rooms & guns. If you have a problem climbing ship ladders, that will be an issue. There were two short movies at the end showing the Iowa in WWII battles. You can order tickets online at small discount. The Princess cruise ship is at the same pier, so you may want to schedule a date where the ship in not in port as then it will be crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edvonlef
50,"Excellent Tour, Incredible Ship","This is a must visit for anyone that is a history buff or interested in seeing naval warships. The tour is self-paced but very well planned out as you are guided by signs/arrows throughout the ship. Almost every area is available to be explored and there is a lot of good information along the way from signs, retired vets and other guides/volunteers throughout the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mt-42
50,A MUST SEE PLACE and WORTH THE $15.00,I served in the Navy 1965-1970 and this is the first time boarding a battleship. The volunteers on board were veterans and very informative and friendly. The tour is self guided. If you have any walking difficulties it may not be for you. Many up and down ladder/steps to see the entire ship. If you stay on the main deck it will be ok. Don't miss it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tazman1972
50,"game of Battleship, anyone?","While staying in the LA area, planned on touring this battleship. I always throw history into our vacations. This was well worth the time and money. Our two kids, ages 17 and 14 even found it interesting. Even though it's a self guided tour, the officers on board were very helpful in answering questions we may have had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecC4863MA

50,Great piece of history,"We spent a approx. 1.5 hours touring around the ship. I think it was great to take the family too, and the yellow arrows make it easy to make it through the whole ship. Helpful guides along the way, gave great information about the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/339jena
40,great chance to experience living history,"Try to bring grandparents or older adults or history buffs with you -- it will make the experience more rewarding. That being said, the docents are well-informed and love to talk about their experiences. The word ""awesome"" is overused, but this ship truly is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HermosaPaula
50,A great treat to see,I have been to this amazing ship several times. To call the group that provides the tours and keeps this piece of history in shape passionate is an understatement. The knowledge and quality/condition of the ship is second to none. A great stop all around. One of the best qualities that they do everything to keep the ship unmodified as possible. So there are some steep stairs to keep in mind.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eat1200

50,USS Battleship IOWA Long Beach,"If you are joining or leaving a Princess Cruise, or another cruise line that also uses this same pier and port, from the San Pedro Pier, this attraction is right there on site! It is a great ship. The ship has lots to see and learn about it's history. It is not wheelchair capable and walker's would also be a problem since you are walking about a ship with stairs (ladders) to climb. This is the ship that President Roosevelt was on during the signing of the surrender of Japan after WWII. You get to see his bathtub! No Navy vessel but this one has an actual bathtub on board. It is a must see attraction and plan on spending several hours on board. There is an admission fee, but remember it helps to pay for the upkeep and maintenance of this old ship so consider it a donation to our history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/497christiet
50,"Fun and historical, in a great harbor setting","Wonderful restored battleship, with additional parts of the ship opening up all the time. On the waterfront in historical San Pedro, a block or two from the original downtown area with great restaurants, shops and watering holes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlgSanPedro
40,worth every cent. a must see,This was a great choice after a cruise walking distanceCost was $20 for twoSelf guided choice. Ship is in very good shape for its age. Extremely interesting some deck renovations being donePaint has been kept up-to-dateFor the most part restoration has been to keep it as much as original.ExceptAnd let me be clear gift shop and photo shop I absolutely hateThis should not be on board it should be on shoreIt truly ruins the feel the value of this ship and the proud sailors who gave their lives for itIf you have time there is a deal to see the Queen Mary using the same ticket. Another must see ship,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyguy747
50,"Great visit, but get directions","I toured the Iowa on a weekday this January, 2015. Very few visitors were there (which was great), likely because the ship is located in San Pedro and took me an hour to find. Location, location, location -- The USS Midway in San Diego is right downtown and is swarmed with people. But the lack of crowds made The Iowa a better experience than visiting the Midway.The docents were really great to talk to and there was even a WW II vet or two that was there. It was a very interesting visit of this beautiful and powerful beast. The last of the breed. Well worth the trip. Hope they can open up a turret in the future. I am going again soon and highly recommend touring the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L993VLtomc
50,"The ""Big Stick""","After over two years of hemming and hawing, I finally took the trip West 66 miles to see the USS Iowa. It was worth the effort. Just to sit foot on a national treasure was hard to discern. The last remaining battleship to become a floating museum, the first of the ""Four Sisters"" has finally found a place to call home. The lead ship of the Iowa class is just remarkable with its overall size and weight, and to think at one time this baby made over 32 knots as it steamed into harms way. I would recommend this visit for everyone, especially young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimhZ8376MS
40,"BIG, bad@ss ship","There aren't many battleships around that you can tour, and this is it for So Cal. It's BIG and has an long and interesting history. Spend a couple of hours. I had a Groupon. Paid parking. Some good nearby eateries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonnyDub
50,"If you like historic ships, this is one you don't want to miss...","The Iowa is a destroyer that is fascinating to tour. This is the ship that took Roosevelt after the war to Europe so he could have a conference with Stalin and Churchill...considering he was wheelchair bound, it was amazing that he could get around this ship. I am sure he was carried up and down the ladders. Even today, this is a ship that is not for the mobility impaired but if you can climb up and down stairs, don't miss it. It is wonderful, and the tour guides that are in each area are wonderfully knowledgeable. We spent about 3 hours on the ship...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laughinghusky
50,Good tour,There were lots of vets willing to tell you about their time on board very interesting. The videos were very helpful and interesting,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adrianna742
50,Great tour of historic ship,"Had a great time. Our tour guide, Linda, was extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. The commitment of the volunteers to lovingly restore the ship is amazing. Well worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wayneb389
40,Very interesting about military history,"The battleship is an interesting museum about militry history. You can walk through San Pedro pier also, and have a beer in nearby bars. Very nice place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/biancatrink
50,Great way to honor those who served.,"I wanted to tour this ship because my brother served on the Iowa. It is so much more than just a piece of history. It is a tribute to those who served on her! You can feel how it must have felt to live in such close quarters, for such long periods of time, and in such stressful times.I found all of the volunteers so knowledgeable about the boat and its place in history and passionate about sharing it with visitors.An important visit...we should not forget...those who served...what they sacrificed...and that many are still making that sacrifice today to keep us free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaB262
50,Well documented history,"Great place to discover history from WW-II to Iraq-1. Many of the docents served on the vessel and make history come alive. Having toured several other battleships, Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Texas, Massachusetts, etc. this one is one of the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/E2497PZjims
40,Definitely worth seeing!,"my husband and I enjoyed our tour of the Iowa. It's a self guided tour but there are plenty of docents who are willing and happy to answer questions. There are many areas off limits, but perhaps in the future, as they are repaired, visitors will be able to see them. There are LOTS of steep stairs to go up and down so wear good shoes. There is plenty of parking and bathrooms are available off the ship. It's definitely worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/342jayh
40,Great peice of history and fun to explore,"Took the self-guided walk, which is $18 per person. That seems high until you learn that the Federal Government and City of Los Angeles have all but disavowed this poor ship that served for a century and held multiple presidents. Your admission fee keeps a piece of history alive, which means something to those who's relatives lived there during war time.So that being said, the walk around the boat was nice. I've now seen several battleship and destroyer class vessels and you can't help but marvel at the size, use of space and sheer power of these machines, all while not falling down serious flights of stairs! There was a lot of the boat NOT currently on display (crew quarters, Admirals deck etc) so you were limited as to what you could visit here, however the battleship is more weapon's heavy and you can see 3 generations of weapons systems on board, which is different than other boats I've been on.One note: the tour ENDS at the museum, which to me would have been far more helpful to START with. After reading some of the museum exhibits (housed in the mess and enlisted quarter areas) I had a better understanding of what I had just looked at and wished I'd known prior to zipping by some of the things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
50,Very interesting museum,"Huge battleship with a lot to see on board, giving you a good idea of what life was like onboard. There is a lot of climbing and walking involved so, be forewarned. Plenty to see and lots of ex service staff to answer questions and share their experiences.Good parking facilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
40,Great piece of History,"Visited in Late December and enjoyed the great self guided tour. Lots to see and quite the ship. Easy to get to, easy parking great helpful and knowledgeable staff. Glad this ship is open for all to see and something very different to see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/847ca
50,Well maintained...excellent tour..helpful docents,"The first WWII battleship I ever toured was in Texas when I was very small. It was exciting 50 years later to tour another of the the great battleships. The Iowa is well maintained and the self guided tour was easy to follow and very informative. The exhibits are laid out well and give you a chance to see most of the ship. It was a special treat when they ""piped"" aboard my son who had served in the Navy. The docents are very friendly and eager to help; quick to answer my sons many questions about the ship. I do not recommend this attraction for those who have difficulty with steep stairs as there are many on the ship with no aids to help those with mobility issues. We purchased the tour as part of a Queen Mary package that included the Queen Mary, the Scorpion submarine and the USS Iowa. The tickets must be purchased at the Queen Mary ticket booth which is located 7 miles from where the USS Iowa is moored. I recommend going on line to the Queen Mary site to review the many package options. I highly recommend the USS Iowa tour as it is fun , informative and very inspirational. A tribute to the brave sailors that served and died on this amazing ship that never lost a battle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tennessee50plus
40,My husbands choice,"Every once in awhile my husband has a special desire to visit something. This time it was this ""boat"". I went as a reluctant companion but ended up really enjoying the history that went along with such a ship. It was a day well spent & he REALLY enjoyed it which made it more fun for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/swancastle
40,Great for all ages,Really worth the time to go visit. Good for all ages. Be sure to ask lots of questions to the on board volunteers. They each have great stories to tell. Not something for physically challenged. Lots of steep stairs and obstacles. We took our 4 year old grandchildren and had lots of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler477
50,What a treat!,"This is like taking a step back into history. USS Iowa is the ship on which FDR and Churchill met at the beginning of the Second World War in order to plan the Normandy invasion. They have original papers on the ship from the planning. A must see for anyone who is a history buff. But word to the wise, do not go unless you can navigate up and down five flights of very narrow steel stairs. Also, it is the only battleship that is docked on the west coast. The veterans who are on the ship to answer questions are full of interesting stories. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailFitzpatrick
40,Gracefull ending for a Beautiful Lady,"We visited the USS Iowa yesterday and we had high expectations after visiting the USS Missouri last year in Hawaii. The tour of the Iowa isn't as complete as the Missouri's well financed updates and refurbished shipboard areas. I can believe that the Iowa volunteers will someday get everything shipshape but it will take time and money. My father served on the Missouri during the Korean War and the Iowa soon after. For those who don't make it to Hawaii to visit the USS Arizona Memorial and the USS Missouri please visit the USS Iowa in San Pedro, CA. Its worth your time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheRichard26
40,Interesting,"Having visited the Midway in San Diego we were expecting more. We got a deal from their website for a family 4 pack for $39. Had I paid full price for everyone I would've been disappointed. That said, it was interesting see at least once. It's a self guided tour that meanders around the ship with signs to read and friendly docents throughout. If you go, definitely take the time to talk to them. They help make the tour so much more interesting. If you have mobility issues or little ones be aware there are several steep stairs along the tour.For the kids, they have a scavenger hunt to find Vicky (pictures of a dog placed along a tour that once lived on the ship). One of the docents told us that Vicky had a uniform with decorations he had earned. She said he once jumped ship to chase after some seals, and was demoted and had a stripe removed from his uniform.I know they are doing the best they can with the funding they have. It would be nice to see more interactive elements.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dotfurio1
40,"Interesting but if going to San Diego, USS Midway is fabulous",We were in LA for 3 days and visited the USS Iowa before heading to San Diego for 4 days. The Iowa was $18 each and was a self guided and although there were a few docents (WW2 vets there to answer questions) you just walked the path and looked around the ship. Not having seen a ship before I found it very interesting. There are many steep steps (ladders) to climb so for seniors this would be real challenge. We then headed down to San Diego for 4 days and almost didn't go to the USS Midway because we had just seen a ship but with the great reviews and it being a aircraft carrier we decided to go. It was off the scales incredible. There was a free headset that gave you many many stories at each point in the tour and there were dozens of docents that did long presentations with stories of their experiences on the ship that I will remember always. Both were good and different but if you are going to LA and San Diego and only going to one ship I would do the Midway.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennyPeter
50,A Must See for all ages,"There aren't many cities where they have ships available for touring. San Pedro took many years of planning and fundraising to eventually get the USS Iowa, sister ship to the USS Missouri to finally get home ported in town. You'll have an opportunity to walk around this ship and touch a great part of American history. As a Veteran, I'm proud to have her nearby!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JRRosa
40,"Great, needs a little more to be perfect","I've always wanted to explore one of the big ships from WW2 and for $18 I finally got my chance. They have worked hard keeping up her main areas so you can walk through them on a self-guided tour. They have the areas locked off so you won't get lost but that also limits you to only seeing a fraction of the ship.Some of the highlights are the flag and navigation decks, captains quarters, some officer quarters in varying degrees, and some of the enlisted bunking. You see the galley, the mess, and get to climb and descend a few ladders and stairs. They have one of the 5"" guns open but it is difficult to get up and see into it.Missing from the tour is anything below decks such as engine rooms. Most disappointing thing for me is that none of the 16"" main gun turrets are open, nor any of the adjoining support rooms. I found that really odd. The highlight of the ship should be the main armament and seeing how these big guns were operated but that isn't the case. Really too bad. Also, there is a lot stripped from the ship - you would expect this because she is a museum now but it is still a little disappointing not to see her as her crews saw her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustinLD

40,Interesting tour,"The IOWA is a work in progress, and it clearly is going to get better. They are in the midst of raising some money to start doing some improvements to the decking and other areas of interest.That being said, the tour is, at this point, a little limited. They have done a great job of creating a self-guided tour, and you do see a lot of the major points of the ship. The men stationed around the tour are extremely helpful and informative. The tour takes you through various berthing spaces, both enlisted and officers' country, and through the flag and navigation bridges. They have done a good job of putting up signs explaining some of the various weapons systems, some of which are new, and some date back to WWII.Hopefully they will eventually open up one of the 16-inch turrets to allow a glimpse of the loading stations, etc. They do have one of the 5-inch mounts open.Be prepared to climb some ladders.If you have never visited a battleship, this is a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bbwex
50,Improved Since Last Visit!,"My younger son's birthday is in early December and when we asked him what he'd like to do for his special day, he enthusiastically picked a return visit to the USS Iowa.We got up early on Saturday, Dec 13 and drove down to the harbor and spent the day wandering around the ship. This visit, my wife joined us, having missed the first visit the boys and I did back in May, 2014.In the few months since our last visit, the museum has been doing steady improvements to the ship. They're beginning to replace all the teak decking (you can buy old pieces for a $5 donation). This is a long term expensive project so donations are heartily welcomed. They've also started on construction of on-board bathroom facilities. Additionally, they've opened one of the dual purpose twin five inch gun turrets so you can look inside. While you can't climb in, you can at least get a really good idea of the cramped and dangerous working conditions that these sailors operated in. They've also included some video accounts from retired sailors who served on the Iowa from WW2 to her retirement. It was really interesting to hear about the living conditions during WW2.Since the mess hall and kitchen facilities look well taken care of, I'm personally hoping they eventually establish a small restaurant on-board. That would be ideal.The gift shop is, of course, a highlight for my little guys. The day was perfect - clear weather, not too warm or cold - for a day on this living piece of American history. It's well worth the visit.Some notes:1. Lots of stairs, lots of ducking under low pipes. Be advised.2. Docents are excellent. They're great sources of information. Meet them and learn!3. There's not much in the way of eating establishments in that area so you may end up driving somewhere for lunch or dinner.4. Use the directions provided on their website. My GPS insisted on taking us through backstreets which simply increased the overall time and got me lost. I used the directions on their website on the prior visit and they were much better.5. Don't forget your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls

50,Our Nation's History Comes Alive!,My husband and I had the privilege of touring the Battleship Iowa. Several knowledgeable volunteers on board are happy to answer questions and bring the ship's history from World War II through the Cold War alive. The huge battleship has been painstakingly restored. There is a self-guided tour which includes several decks of the vessel and includes the Captain's quarters which President Roosevelt occupied during a trip to North Africa during WWII.

50,Great tour - amazing ship,"I highly recommend taking the USS Iowa tour. It is self guided, but there are guides along the way to answer questions or give you a little ship history. There are lots of very steep stairs so plan your shoes accordingly! I wouldn't recommend bringing toddlers, but young children are encouraged and they have a little game for them to play as you tour. Plan on 1 -2 hours depending on your walking pace and personal interests. Beautiful ship with a brave and honored history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ba272
50,Great experience!,"we took this tour during the port stop in between back to back cruises on the golden princess cruise ship. the iowa is only a short walk through the cruise terminal parking lot, and if your pre, post, or in-transit on a cruise, the tour is only $10.00. its worth every penny! i was on a light cruiser in 1968 and thought that was a pretty good sized ship, but the iowa is huge! if youve ever been in the navy, or are on the tour with someone who has been, this tour should not be missed. the ship didnt appear to be ""tour modified"" very much at all. the interior spaces and outside deck areas looked to be basically unchanged from when it was in active service. we took the tour mid-day on a weekday so we pretty much had the ship to ourselves which was really nice. not sure what its like on a weekend or holiday. the docents were wonderful, flowing with information, and a world book of knowledge about the history and statistics of the ship. you take the tour at your own pace, following pathway arrows along the way. the docents are located all throughout the tour areas so its impossible to miss anything or get lost. the tour does require using some pretty steep ladder-type stairways so this might not be the best tour for someone who has difficulty with going up and down stairs. you can do a really good tour and see everything there is to see in couple of hours at a leisurly pace. they do not rush you through the tour, so depending on how much information you want to glean from the docents or how long you want to view a particular area or item, it can take longer. there were no picture taking restrictions so feel free to click away. the next time youre in the san pedro area and looking for something different to do, by all means take this tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casperntn1

Only wish more of the ship would have been accessible - but thats maybe too much to ask for. $18 for adult. Have to pay extra for parking, but it wasnt too much. Not stroller friendly though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrodeEyolf
50,L.A. Trip with Dad,Had a great time visiting the USS IOWA! We took my father who is a Vietnam veteran and not only did they announce his arrival thanking him for his service over the PA system but they were nice enough to track down the key to one of the gun mounts so my dad could show us where he sat. It was very moving for him and ment a lot to us. Thank you for a beautiful moment!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TawnyaThurman
50,Family visit,Took my Grandkids here for the tour. They took a real good interest on the visit here and was amazed by the size of the ship and the history around it.

I would recommend taking the family there and I would definitely go back as they open up other sections up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D1291DYjohno
40,Interesting step back in history,"Glad I made the effort to come and visit. Really awesome and majestic sentinel of past historical achievements. Was great to walk it, feel it, see frozen in time different areas of the ship. Not sure if I was entitled to a guided tour, I guess so, but I tailed on one that had started. It really is many times more useful having someone explain things as you went through the ship. Otherwise much would remain a mystery.Really liked the bath tub that was brought in for fdr? And also the steel door that had been cut and afterwards re welded shut with plate.Impressive and enjoyable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86Pete1958
50,U.S. History in San Pedro,Hands down the best part of this tour are the volunteers who offer stories and answer questions as long as guests keep asking. FDR's bedroom is an exhibit in itself.There are a tremendous amount of stairs many are narrow and ladder like. I don't recommend this for anyone with mobility concerns.I look forward to returning as they open more areas of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halobb
50,An Opportunity to Board a Battleship,"We all learn history, but nothing compares to ""seeing & touching"" it. Take a tour with one of the many volunteers for a fascinating look back at the incredible engineering on this ship before the computers of today. You can do a self-guided walk, but a personal tour offers so much more information and a chance to ask questions --great info Doug Johnson. There are many ladders and thresholds to navigate, so wear appropriate shoes. It was so remarkable to learn the speed at which the huge guns could be fired, the team work that was required and the courage of those who served. Many people travel to Pearl Harbor to see the Battleship Missouri, but you can see an identical ship here--the Battleship USS Iowa. Don't miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getaways2
40,Impressive,"I have toured the Battleship Missouri in Hawaii and now the Iowa. Both Iowa class Battleships, probably the most impressive war ships ever constructed.

40,Battleship Iowa,"As this iconic ship has only been available for tours since 2012, I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to take the tour. I am a scuba diver and love to dive wrecks, but I am glad this one is where she is. The renovation information was outstanding, all the volunteers around the ship were very informative. A well worth while visit if you are anywhere close.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiveFanDeb
50,American Might on Display,"She is called the Battleship of Presidents as the U.S.S. Iowa hosted multiple visits by different presidents, but most notably FDR on his journeys during WWII to consult with Winston Churchill on the conduct of the war. Being able to enter FDR's stateroom and see the accommodations made for FDR proved insightful, especially after Ken Burn's terrific miniseries on the ""Roosevelts."" The Iowa simultaneously boosts pride and consternation. How can a nation that designed and built a masterful warship such as this one be facing the many crises of infrastructure and innovation today? It leaves one puzzling. Visitors will come away from visiting the U.S.S. Iowa appreciating that the ""Greatest Generation"" applied not only to our fighting forces, but to the minds and ingenuity that designed just such a vessel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonMarinelli

They had people stationed around the ship to talk about the history and great stories. You can not get a feeling of how big and heavy that ship is until you are there in person and see those big 16 inch guns on the deck. Anybody that loves old ships with battle history, this is a must visit.She had been moored in the ghost fleet in San Francisco Bay for years. Than was cleaned up and moved to Los Angeles Harbour. Check their web site for hours and direction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephA141
50,Such a great experience.,"From the moment you step aboard the ship the volunteers are fantastic, and filled with stories and factoids to a degree I didn't even expect. Even with out being part of one of the VIP tours , your granted access to so much of the ship, it really does give you the feel of what she's been through , throughout her long illustrious career. I wish I was local to be able to volunteer my time, but sadly I'm all the way across the country. If you have a chance to visit this fantastic ship and show your support I highly recommend it. Even the ships store has some really cool merchandise above and beyond the expect tourist stuff. Definitely a great stop for anyone who's followed this ship at all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheetahjab

50,"The ""Big Stick""","Read about this ship online, and decided I had to see it in person. I wasn't disappointed! The ship is huge! Admission is $18, but we got $3 off for some reason (must be my smile lol!). They take a pic of you against a green screen backdrop before you start. You can take a guided tour, or a self-guided one, we picked the latter. You'll need a few hours to really take it all in. Very informative guides along the way to answer any questions, with lots of photo-ops. They have a lot of areas roped off to the general public, but it's still very interactive. The highlight was standing on the deck with the big guns and finding out just how far they could fire! There's a souvenir shop at the end of the tour, right before the exit, where you can purchase your pic they took of you before the tour begins (around $20).

50,great family visit,"we took our 3 children here one morning during a recent disneyland and beach vacation. We went during the week in October (on a tuesday) and it was not crowded and easy to navigate and enjoy the experience and learn some interesting world war 2 history (and more as this battleship and been deployed to several different wars and conflicts).There is a great gift shop at the end of the tour. We purchased the photos and some books on naval ships.The tour itself gets an A+ because (for the independent minded like myself) it is SELF-GUIDED!!! You can tour at your own pace without having to stay in a group and hear memorized speeches. Another plus is there are plenty of staff available to answer questions or provide information as you enquire or have interest. I personally prefer this style of touring ten times over an ""official guided tour""We saw the quarters where FDR stayed on board. You are able to go on several layers of the trip. My wife has a disability but was able to tour just fine (another good benefit of touring at your own rate). There are lots of stairs to climb (almost more like ladders) but for the most part the hand rails and grips are sturdy. Certainly a great place to take kids and we definitely recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/troyj521
50,Great experience.,"What a ship! A stunning array of armour and firepower -- along with an incredible complex of systems and equipment to support it all. The guides were well-informed, pleasant and enthusiastic. I highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobP234678
50,An Amazing Ship,"Our cruise ship docked beside this ship and I had time to go and visit. It is an interesting experience to be able to get up close and personal with such a mighty warship. There is a self guiding tour that allows you visit the guns, the officer's mess, the Captain's Cabin where FDR spent time when he was on the ship, and the galley. To walk on the teak decks is an experience in itself. There is a gift shop on board where souvenirs can be purchased. Allow several hours to fully explore the ship. Remember this is a war ship and so the stairs are steep and narrow - when going down you should descend backwards. If you are on a cruise ship docked at the San Pedro cruise port and in transit, it is well worth the time taken to get off your ship and visit this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trainfan2000
50,"Great Ship, awesome history","My dad was in the Navy, so it was really great to see this ship and hear about it's long history of being one of our great battleships. Take the family, dress warm if you go in the winter months!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_Guy_412
50,Great experience,We toured the battleship and learned a lot. There are retired Navy men guiding the tour and are so knowledgeable! We would highly recommend it. Buy tickets online and save $2 per person.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snookjen
40,"4 out of respect for those who served, and now maintain","Closer to a 3+ It's not the Midway in San Diego in terms of presentation or even the Jeremiah O'Brien in SF, BUT this is one of the few WWII battleships left, and it served for darn near 50 years before its last decommission. I got there late in the day, not crowded and time to explore at will. My experience on all these ships is that guides have been there and done it, and are willing to talk at length when they aren't rushed and if you really interested. A huge plus. Not probably a lot of dollars in the display kitty, and although it is kind of nice to see something that reminded me of 1980's service (that mess), and weapons that were state of the art not so long ago, I might have wished for a little more information to go along with what's there. It is wonderful to see it still afloat, and your kids need a reminder of what sacrifice and duty mean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Big Guns,"I was so excited to visit the latest attraction in the L.A./Long Beach/San Pedro. This amazing battleship was not a disappointment. It wasn't busy when I was on board so I felt like it was my own ship which made the large guns even more overwhelming. There is a lot of open deck things to see and some indoor stuff (maybe choose a non rainy day). There were guides in many of the areas that could explain what you needed to know. It really is the greatest battleship and well worth the visit. Even the gift shop was more impressive than I though. Only downside...no toilets on board to use and no food. That's something they should try to address. Even one toilet and a little snack bar would be great. Still it is new and they only have a certain amount of money to spend. Well worth a visit...not to be missed. Thanks to the lovely folks that volunteer, so helpful and friendly. I like they announce the arrival of veterans as they board as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Baxterthetravelguy
40,History!!!,Not the most exciting tour but very historical. The USS Iowa served for 99 years! It is an amazingly built war ship. Anyone who is big on history should definitely visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jtmit430
40,Interesting bit of history,This ship is interesting and you can google a lot of information about it before seeing it. You need to be able to climb steps and it should be a nice day because of lot of the viewing is outside. This ship has been thru the Panama Canal and one time with friendly fire was responsible for killing a large number of it crew. Volunteers do a nice job and keeping it tourable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xxtrasafe
50,A bit of history,"LA pretty much has something for everyone. As a kind of history buff, i was pleasantly surprised to have the USS Iowa 2 blocks from my condo. It is located in San Pedro, CA on the ""new"" LA waterfront. This attraction is great for all ages. You might even run into a sailor that spent time on her back in the day. An amazing part of our history for all to share. If your travels take you to LA, please make an effort to see this ship. We all owe her a debt of gratitude for her service and our freedom. As always, enjoy fellow trippers!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gkbrownlee
40,Very Impressive,"Even as a career Navy man, I was impressed by the Iowa. The sheer size of the cannons and the displays were well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallis642
50,Amazing piece of American history!,"Visited with my brother, wife and kids. The ship was an awesome example of American industrial might and ingenuity. The volunteer staff was very helpful and friendly. Tickets are not cheap, but we enjoyed it thoroughly! Great opportunity to teach your kids a little history and appreciation for the ""greatest generation"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xrider85
40,"Fascinating, just fascinating!","Took a couple of hours to tour the ship, just a remarkable piece of history and American craftsmanship. Easy walking except of course going from one deck to another, wear shoes, pants or shorts. Will only get better as the volunteers continue to work on the battleship.Worth a second visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fkendell
40,A great piece of history - so glad we went,"Apologies for late post. We visited here July 2014 - scorching hot weather then and as there are exposed decks would advise you bring water and sunscreen in the heat. Good range of memorabilia in rooms that contextualised some of the campaign history. You self-guide (or at least we did) following yellow arrows on the decks - easy to do, but note you have to climb steep ladders throughout and so visitors should be aware if they have mobility issues or young children. Yes it is a work in progress - dedicated volunteers are making the restoration happen - and when we went, there were no toilet facilities on board. There are, I understand, plans to build these for the public - I had to use a portaloo off deck in the car park (not great!) You can take your time going around, and there are great views over the harbour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TessW107

50,Time well spent,"My wife and I, well I was excited, my wife was in awe, and we were not disappointed in touring the USS IOWA. This is a must see and feel. There are so few Battleships left for the general public to visit, take the time, take pictures, view inside and outside of the ship. Some of the ladders are steep , but well worth the time and effort. The videos on the main deck, and in the ships store, helped to make us see how this ship is so important, and with just it's presence is a shock and awe for all who see the ""Big Stick"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/511cliffj
40,Battleship Visit,"It was like stepping back in time, all seemed to have just frozen. My son enjoyed the visit, he is age 7. My daughter was a little young and this was not as interesting to her. I love history, all kinds and this was a nice afternoon visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TalineLovesRoadtrips
40,Great and Informative,"I went here and wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised to learn a great deal. Be aware that there are a lot of stairs/steps on the ship. If you do not have good knees or can't handle steep stairs BE AWARE! Still a great visit since there is an informative video on the deck in the shade.The people on board are great and seem to really enjoy working there. I had a good time and learned a lot. You can take as much time as you want and the tour route is pretty well managed. I went with my boyfriend but easily a good visit for friends, family, or solo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackiet137
50,"Military and history fans, enjoy","It's very nice to see how USA citizens valorize it's national patrimony, not so old, that you can visit and walk thought checking how was to be a sailor, in one of the most important USA ship.Try to buy a combo ticket that allows you to go to the Pacific Aquarium, about 15 min far by car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcos_mmdo
40,Enjoyable if you are into history,"Visited with my husband. First time on a battleship. We like the history about it. I think if my children were with us, they would not have enjoyed it as much as we did. It was interesting history to learn about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamahOF2
50,Great visit to a ship of history,"Was very glad that I got a chance to visit this ship that had performed so long in so many different campaigns.Plenty of veterans on board who can answer your questions. There are also areas that have AV displays showing how things were done 'back in the day'. Very impressive to see the upgrades during the 1980's that added anti-ship missiles and Tomahawk land attack missiles.Several areas of the wooden deck are undergoing maintenance/repair. I donated some extra dollars to help them continue the ongoing restoration.Finding the battleship, parking and exiting the area were all easy, Parking fee is separate from the entrance fee (but parking was very reasonable).If you are in this area and enjoy naval history, be sure to see this beauty. I really enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Truthteller2014
50,Exciting History,It was amazing to see the workings of the ship and understanding how the men had to live while at sea. The parts of the ship we were allowed to see was very impressive. I know there are plans to allow tours of the lower part of the ship where all the work was done. Well worth the admission fee.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pruzPalmDesert
40,Must visit with a WWII vet if possible!,"My husband and I toured this amazing place and were very fortunate because the two gentlemen in front of us were WWII vets. One had actually been on the Iowa during the war and gave us a tour from his perspective, noting changes which were made to accommodate modern weaponry. He was moved to tears several times and said this was the first time he had ever talked so much about his war experience. We felt honored to be with this man and have remained in touch!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peghello
40,AMAZING - ship to board Great History!!!!,My cousin & I thoroughly enjoyed touring the ship. We are female & I want you to know it was very exciting. I surprised her on one of her trips to Sunny Cal. She was thrilled! Don't miss out on this fabulous bit of History. It does however have no wheelchair access. I would recommend you be able to climb alot of stairs. The stairs are NOT typical some are more like chain robe stairs. I'm not a sailor so hope I am describing them correctly! It's a fun day & after head over to Downtown San Pedro for a meal .............,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YardSaleLdy

50,Next time...,"We didn't get to do the full tour because of the Tall Ships Festival that was going on, but the history and stories that the volunteers provided really made it worthwhile. I would love to go back and do the full ship tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/923barbd
50,good sight and history,Fun time at the USS Iowa. You get to walk pretty much all over the ship. The docents are very knowledgeable and fill you in on history and science behind the ship. They can answer almost any question. Also great views of the shipping harbor from the decks. I plan to go back as they are hoping to keep opening up more of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishMT
40,A gem of a battleship,The USS Iowa is docked in San Pedro harbor and is an impressive sight. The tour is self guided so you can take as much time as you'd like to see the ship. It took us about 75 minutes to complete the tour. There are a lot of steps but otherwise it's an easy tour. There are no public bathrooms on the ship so go before you get on the ship. It was so interesting seeing this historical ship and to imagine how the sailors lived aboard. Ports o' call is right down the street so there are many restaurants available nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ibaol
50,An excellent visit,"A younger friend of mine share a birthday and we plan something to do together to celebrate. I have been a ""plank owner"" since long before it was a sure thing Los Angeles was going to get the ship. however I had yet to visit. The old beauty does not fail to impress. My friend and I had an excellent time and spent a good deal more time on Her than we thought it would take. I purchased a Family membership and will be bringing the rest of my family to see Her. As has been mentioned this ship currently has no accommodation and you need to be able to climb stairs, up and down, and to be able to step through some narrow passages to get around this vessel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/244steveng
50,I'm so glad this ended up in my hometown!,"The USS Iowa is a real historical treasure here in San Pedro. The ship tour is self-guided, with assistance at various points by helpful and knowledgeable volunteers. Of particular interest is the video presentation about the operation of the 16-inch guns, and the captain's quarters, which hosted President Roosevelt and his chiefs of staff on their 1944 trip to the Tehran Conference. It does have some steep ladders and narrow corridors, but most folks should be able to get around without too much effort. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GrellisSanPedro_CA
50,second IOWA visit,"This was my second visit to the U.S.S. IOWA. This ship holds a special meaning for me because my dad served aboard her during World War II. The tour takes a couple of hours to really see all there is and the tour staff is very friendly and helpful. It is a warship so it does take some physical ability to get around her. If you have an interest in naval history or just want learn something about this great ship, I highly recommend visiting her. The world will probably never see ships like the IOWA on the high seas again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/384victors
40,A great experience,"I like all around WWII so I decided to visit this ship, it is very interesting and the people who is taking care of it is doing a great job, it is amazing to be on the decks of a real battleship that saw action on WWII and other wars, it has been updated and it has some modern wapons that makes the visit a little more timeless, it would be great if the cannons were open to public but anyway it is a nice visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gnomo_hammer
50,US Historical Battleship,One of four build and was last commissioned for Iraq War ( Desert Storm). It's an incredible honor to have been able to tour this battleship and have veterans who served on it give the tour. A must visit if you enjoy military crafts and it's histories. Loved the experience and to think it was build in the 1930's and last commissioned in 1995 and it could be commissioned again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmvizzo
50,Historical,"Visited here with Grandchildren. Caught a tour that explained portions of the ship available to see. Lots of steep stairs up and down. Very interesting ship built for WW2 and upgraded to some middle defense. Takes about 3 hours to see. If you served in the military give name and rank upon boarding, also their is a find the stations for children with small prize. Wish main guns and engine room were open to view. We will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Perkadventures
50,Fantastic experience aboard this historic ship,"The Iowa is a ship that we have wanted to visit for a long time. Coming from Brooklyn, we knew the ship was built at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and we wanted to see the handiwork of our local shipbuilders during World War II. The staff were really wonderful, and we had the opportunity to meet the curator, Dave Way, who showed us around during our visit. One of the highlights of the ship is seeing the cabin that President Franklin D. Roosevelt used when Iowa carried him part of the way to the Tehran conference in 1943 – the bulkhead doors were cut away at the bottom to accommodate his wheelchair, and a special bath tub was installed. The staff of volunteers were great, and we learned that many of them had spent weeks, in some cases months, living aboard the ship when it was being prepped to be turned into a museum. The ship is truly a labor of love, and we really enjoyed exploring it from stem to stern.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/afgustaf
40,Worth it & amazing!!!,"The weather started out cold so we decided to check this battleship on the way to the beach. Battleship has lots of history, it is educational, unique and interesting to tour the whole ship. Apparently, we only saw 20% of the ship so they are trying to raise more funds to revamp the rest of the ship. Would love to see it again in a few years. It took 2,000 volunteers to get the first part of the USS Battleship Iowa renovations completed...now that's simply amazing. There is no restroom on the ship so you better go to one before you do the tour and it is not handicapped accessible yet (they are working on it). Lots of parking available on site. Highly recommend this tour and adventure. The $18 admission is worth it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marites8
50,The Battleship Iowa - Adventure Saturday,"The family went to visit the Battleship Iowa on one of our, ""Adventure Saturdays,"" and this visit was a real home run for everyone. The ship was amazing to tour around. Many areas were opened to the public and even some areas which were closed had plastic/glass over them so you could at least see inside. What a vast ship this was and so full of history. If you have children this is a must see. The whole day, including the parking, two adults and one child tickets, and lunch at nearby restaurant, was as I recall less than $100 for everything, so it was a very reasonable outing for the amount of fun we had.Here's a fun game we made up:When you're leaving for the day from the ship, set your trip odometer and then count down to the range of 23.6 miles, the Iowa's main gun's maximum range, you and kids will be amazed at how far the reach of the ship really is.One of the coolest things too was that the guns on the ship and its boilers are all still operational and not rendered inert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ckeveny

30,It's ok,It's interesting. Pretty cool battleship nothing too outrageous or out of this world to brag about. Sorry folks.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLoh_11
50,Great Military History,The USS Iowa is a great tour that takes you thru most of the ship. We didn't take a guided tour but it would be worthwhile if you did. Most fascinating are the huge guns and the Captains Quarters where they had made a bedroom for FDR. There is a fee to see the ship and $1 an hour parking. The view of the harbor is exhilarating. There are many stairs to climb and the trip up three flights of stairs in a row is intimidating. Also intimidating is the lack of toilets. There are none on the ship and only one unisex one down the street. The volunteers said they are working on the problem. The volunteers are the best and everyone was super friendly. There is a game foe the little kids called find Vicky (Vicky was the canine mascot). My thanks to Linda who guided me to the end of the tour when the stirs got too much for me. Don't miss the short movie on. How they bought Iowa to Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skyros7
50,Awesome. Wonderful History,"This was a great attraction, and affordable (18.00). Lots of wonderful history here and the ship itself is incredible. It was just my husband and I so we really able to enjoy it. They don't allow strollers/wheelchairs, etc..because the entire tour you are climbing up and down stairs (fairly deep stairs).f",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39donnah
50,Must see!,"I visited the USS Iowa BB-61 while in California in July of 2014. I was amazed at how much access there was to visitors on board. It was a pleasant surprise at how interesting the ship was. There was a fee to visit, but well worth it as it goes to help preserve this national treasure. I suggest that anyone in the area should take the time to visit this ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1horselover
40,Very Cool!,"I came here with my younger sister and we both really enjoyed experiencing a battleship for the first time. The tour is very cool because you get to all through the many levels of the ship. Visitors get a good view of the harbor, they get to learn a fact here and there about the ship's role in it's various wars, and the gift shop offers a variety of cool souvenirs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blaugrana10
50,Fun for Everyone on the USS Iowa,"Won free tickets to get aboard the USS Iowa. This ship is conveniently located in San Pedro. The parking cost like $5 which is reasonable. But if you don't mind walking, park in the neighborhoods. I for one had a good time learning about the rich history of our nation and our military. Veterans are on the ship who were there to teach about the ship and answer any questions. They were all kind and loved to talk, they all had some great stories to tell. Going through the ship was fantastic since I've only been able to see the outsides of our nation's war ships, this was a treat. The feeling there is nostalgic and made me feel proud to be American. While on the ship wear comfortable shoes because there is a lot of walking and there are tiny stairwells to get to different levels of the ship. This is recommended for people of all ages, families and singles alike. A must see if you are in the San Pedro area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ASega2011
50,Historical experience,"We decided to visit the USS Iowa after getting off a cruise in San Pedro and were thrilled we decided to. The tour entertained the kids (2, 4, and 6) for several hours. There was so much to see & so much history to take in. The kids enjoyed the hide and seek activity they provided for them. Word of warning, though, there are some areas that are a bit difficult to go through (steep, narrow stairs) that we had to help the little ones with. I have recommended the battleship to others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419lindseyh
40,Better than old Queen Mary,"I used to love the old Queen Mary tour but the ocean liner is really run down now. Iowa is fixed up really good and the tour is very informative. The gift shop is full of junk and really overpriced but, hey, how many gift shops aren't?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/51impr
50,"""A Great lesson in American Military history""","Seeing this battleship and learning about it's history was an amazing experience and I recommend to everyone. Hearing first hand from the staff on the Iowa what part in American history this ship served was an experience. It is a little difficult to maneuver, there are a lot of steep stairs and tight quarters. My oldest son is 6'2 and really had to be aware of where his head was. Seeing FDR's bathtub and living quarters was one of the highlights for me",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scraphappy256
50,One of the best experiences I've ever had,"What else is there to say but this is a battleship!! Easy access and parking. The ship still has plenty of 4th July bunting up and really helped add to the whole atmosphere of the ship. This was a huge day for me, as one of the former sailors accidentally photo bombed one of our photos which led us to get talking to him about his time on board etc. He then offered me the opportunity to fire the hour gun on the side of the ship. Thank you Jim, that will live me me for life. Other former sailors onboard gave some great insights as to life onboard throughout its history. The tour is self guided and easy to follow. My little nephew had just as much fun as I did. This is highly recommended to anyone going to or staying in the greater Los Angeles area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertH500
50,"A ""must see"" when in San Pedro","This ship is amazing. Definitely worth seeing. The tour was self directed with guides explaining things along the way. The walking path was arranged well, which allowed people to go at their own pace without affecting others. Veterans are greeted with an overhead announcement which was nice. Not handicap accessible. You must be able to climb steps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MardelleL
50,Fun Experience,"We bought the Aquarium and Battleship bundle tickets, saving $. They can be purchased online, or right at the ticket booth for the same price as online.You pay for parking here, costing us $6.00 for 2 hours. It took 2 hours for the self guided tour. My 8 year old, 14 year old, husband, and I all enjoyed this tour. There are some inside and some outside parts of the tour- it was hot, but there are fans and AC units going inside the ship. The volunteers are stationed throughout the tour, and gave us a wealth of information. They were great. One of my favorite parts of this excursion was viewing the massive cargo ships from the Battleship. There are benches to sit and watch the busy cargo water area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmieMo
50,Great fun for everyone/anyone,"I have long looked at the USS Iowa BB-61 from the I110 and Highway 1 and from San Pedro and I often say, I need to go there. Why not? We go to libraries ad nausium, we watch documentaries, and go to museums all the time... Why not visit a floating museum that has the lives of sailors written in the soul of the ship. I saw one comment on a review that said ""tour is a little too long."" I didn't think so, you can always turn around if you like. Getting off the ship is easy...The history is really fun, and there are docents around to answer your questions. Be careful, some of these guys can talk your ear off:) I found the tour fun and interesting, though, I love modern history and I love battleships, etc... I had a good time.Take time to take pictures of the big guns, look at the officers quarter, the mess hall, the movies that are provided. They all provide context for the ship. In addition, they do have a nice store where you can buy memorabilia. All in all it was a fun afternoon, and we got great pictures of the ship and the view of the San Pablo/LA Harbor. Its one of those things that everyone should do at least once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/battmast

50,U S S IOWA,"It is a great thing to see the walk through tour has lots of stairs steep and mostly steel. I don't recommend sandals or any type of heels. This is a good place for classroom field trips, But a smaller children probably not good. A chance to see a part of our great country's history. This tour is 10 bucks parking is by the hour. Cool gift shop at end of tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whaledaker
50,"Oh, the Incredible History of This Amazing Ship!","My family and I are history buffs. My son, in particular, loves anything and everything that has to do with the military and/or World War II. So needless to say, we loved our visit to the Battleship USS Iowa. If you have even the slightest interest in history, this ship is a must see. I'll admit I didn't know much about the Battleship USS Iowa prior to our visit, but after I left, I was just floored with the history of this incredible ship. One of the most fascinating things I learned was that the Invasion of Normandy was devised on this ship crossing the Atlantic with Roosevelt onboard. During our visit, there was a retired marine who explained the history of the ship and did an truly amazing job - I didn't want him to end his presentation.I also absolutely loved that when military persons arrived to tour the ship, their name, rank, branch of the military and when they served was announced to the entire ship.I was so glad we took the time out to see the Battleship USS Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MXB
50,USS Iowa Battleship,We had a blast walking the decks & learning it's history (President Roosevelt was once on board!). The personnel were very friendly & informative! Food was good! (BBQ!)More photos here:https://www.facebook.com/darrin.forsythe/media_set?set=a.10202990825344080.1073741871.1007685002&type=3,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Darrin_Forsythe
50,If you see one thing while in California- THIS should be it!,"As you pull into the lot you'll begin to realize that what you're about to see is not your average sight. This incredible example of American industry & military might. One of the first things you see as you step onto the deck is Turret #2 where 47 Sailors died when a powder explosion occurred on April 19, 1989. This is just the first of many examples of heroics and sacrifices made by the crews of the ship the call the Ship of Presidents and The Big Stick. The ship is massive and the sheer weight & size of her 16"" main guns is simply incredible but there is so much more you will get to see aboard the lead ship of the Iowa class Battleships. The history you will learn and the volunteers who staff her will give you a respect for the crews who served with honor and distinction aboard her throughout her service defending our nation. If you have just one chance to see something in California, THIS should be it. You and your friends & family will share an experience which you will always remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyre926

30,Thank You for Your Service...,Spent a magnificent Father's Day with my kids on board the Iowa. The best part of the tour are the docents who are retired navy veterans who are a wealth of knowledge and history. Great for history buffs and military personnel.One suggestion for future development of the tour is to add historical speech/conversations within the many rooms one gets to explore where there are no volunteers available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeithF672
40,Good way to spend a Sunday morning...,"We just visited last Sunday morning. There was no waiting to get on board (other than waiting for the bathroom when we got there--be aware the bathrooms on-site were out-of-order and we had to wait for a single restroom across from the ship entrance).It took us around 3 hours to do the self-guided tour. We wished we could've seen a little more of the ship, but you do seem to get to see quite a bit of it. Our brother / brother-in-law who has also seen the USS Missouri in Hawaii said that you can see quite a bit more of the USS Missouri than what you can of the USS Iowa. We watched the movie ""Battleship"" when we returned home and it was interesting to see the ship in the movie (in movie it was the USS Missouri, but both ships are ""Iowa class"" so the Iowa is basically same design).There were volunteers peppered around who would answer questions and provide interesting snippets of info. We enjoy history, so it was an interesting and worthwhile way to spend our last day in L.A.Our 11 year old son was not as interested, however, and was just barely ""tolerating"" the experience (he would've preferred an hour on the ship versus everyone else's 3 hours). Our 13 year old daughter is quite interested in history, so wanted to read everything and did enjoy it, so as far as ""kid value"" it really depends on your kids and what they are interested in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muckfamily
50,Magnificent ship,"This is a must see if you're taking a trip to Los Angeles. The Iowa and Iowa class battleships are true pieces of living history having gone through WWII, Korea, Vietnam (the New Jersey BB-62), and Desert Storm. You really get overwhelmed going through seeing the weaponry, the crew berthing, the bridge, and just what made the ship go.Definitely a must for anyone who loves history, learning about WWII to Desert Storm, or Naval Warfare enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelnQ2312AS
50,"Self guided tour, very nice.",We did the self guided tour and it was very nice. A lot of good info and history. There were many volunteers that were helping along the way if people had any questions. My dad was very helpful at explaining what different things were on the ship as he served 20 years in the Navy. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Navy ships and has a few hours to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/190markk
50,Great for Students!,"As an 8th grade history teacher, I organized a field trip for over 100 of my students. It was a great visit! The veterans who led four different small groups were very knowledgable and informative. They fielded all sorts of questions from my students with care and made this truly an educational experience they will remember.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mpg9395
40,Very Big Ship!,I liked that we could actually see the ship in one day. We got to sit in the Captain's seat and see what it was like to fire on the enemy. It was really amazing to see how they lived aboard ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zoofamily
40,Something Different,"Definitely a unique attraction. It's fun to tour an actual Battleship that had its own place in history. It is basically a floating museum where the main attraction is the structure itself! The tour is self guided, just follow the arrows. Be prepared to climb up and down steep ship steps. Talk to the docents peppered around as they have fun and interesting facts to share! Tour can be as long or as short as you make it. I think we made it through in about an hour or hour and a half. This is an ideal visit for someone who loves anything nautical or military. We had a good time learning the history. Wish more things were labeled on the ship regarding what they were used for. We made up our own assumptions which was entertaining. There sure were a lot of ""espresso machines"" on that ship! If you are in the South Bay definitely give it a visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenandallthethings
50,Loved the narrated tour guides,"It is a self guided tour. Very simple, just follow the yellow arrows. It takes about 2 hours to take the tour. There are docents throughout the ship in various areas telling stories about the section they are in. It is very fun & informative. Would love to tour it again when more is available to tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherF888
50,A Piece of History not to be missed,"We went on a Monday, which was the perfect day to visit the Iowa. Only took us a few hours to see everything. Liked the self tour, with the easy to follow arrows. Volunteers were super friendly, one even giving us the history of the flag system used by all international ships. You get to see a lot more of the ship than I thought you would, from the living quarters to the bridge and everything in between. They did an amazing job of restoring the ship, right down to the hand-painted flag on the top deck. Wonderful way to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzPolverino
40,One of the few battleships left,As I have an interest in naval warfare I was looking forward to visiting the ship and it didn't disappoint. I understand that it is a trust rather than the state which looks after the ship and they do a great job and are currently restoring parts such as the teak deck. Veterans are on board to discuss the ship with you and the size of the guns and turrets are simply staggering. The UK had the worlds biggest battleship fleet and failed to keep a single one as a museum possibly due to the inclement climate and impact this would have an maintenance. Good on the US for keeping all four Iowa class battleships as museums. All in all a must visit for any naval enthusiast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shatnersbasoon75
40,Great historical attraction,"USS Iowa folks put together a great self-guided tour. Takes 2 to 2.5 hours but there is no pressure to hurry so we took longer.I estimate the tour covered about 1/4 of the ship. The part of the ship open to visitors is well lit and well ventilated. i was hoping to see much more but was told that they are working on adding more areas to the tour, adding the needed ventilation, etc. Areas not in the tour right now are: inside main turrets, engine room, all areas 3 decks or more above the main deck and all areas 2 decks or lower than the main deck.Will definitely be going back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rone860
40,"Worth seeing, and will be better in the years to come","I rate visiting the Iowa ""very good"" (instead of excellent) because of the limited areas that are open, for example, no turret is open to visitors. There's working on preparing more areas, and I'll return when more has been completed.Still, getting a sense of these the magnitude of these old battleships is worth the stop. Some great volunteers who shared their time and experiences with me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tennisbump
50,Great learning experience,"The battleship is a great visit! You watch lots of documentaries about WW2, but to actually walk around the deck and see the size of the guns, is very impressive. There are docents that are extremely knowledgeable and share that knowledge with you. Your get to visit many areas of the ship. I would recommend this tour to anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailD837
50,So Amazing!!!!!,"My husband and I spend an afternoon aboard the Battleship USS Iowa. It was AMAZING!!!! EVERYONE should go aboard this ship and take in the magic!!! Im serious....this ships history is in incredible. Its an honor just to stand aboard a ship that has seen SO MUCH over the years.I believe it cost us like $15 per person to board. Its a self-guided tour,,,,but they have volunteers ALL along your way to educate you and answer questions. It WILL take about 3 1/2 hours to really take your time, and get through the whole ship. Many of the men and women on board who volunteer, also served in the military. They are all very, very nice, very knowledgeable people. They will answer any questions you have.Its the perfect tour to take your children on. Its fun, AND they are learning.Go on a sunny day and MAKE SURE you wear comfortable shoes. If you are a woman, make sure you do not wear a skirt (I did, and it was a pain in the butt. Lesson learned.) You will be climbing up and down some VERY steep stairs. Its a ship,,,so there are tight spaces and you will be going back and forth between indoors and outdoors. If you are claustrophobic, you will not like this tour. If you get chilly,,,,,layer,,,it can be cold on some parts of this ship, and hot in others.They have an AMAZING gift shop at the end of the tour. Pick up a little something to remember your day by. Take your camera!!!!! Make sure to use the restroom BEFORE you get on the ship. There are no working restrooms on board (just a tip,,,especially if you have small children.)Enjoy!! It was a privilege and an honor to be on board such an amazing part of history.Go have fun on Battleship USS Iowa!!! It's worth it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AprilmlcPeck
50,Father's Day aboard USS Iowa,"Great day! The volunteer veterans were extremely knowledgeable and friendly, really enjoyed hearing their stories. I was especially humbled by the experiences shared by the two WWII veterans. I felt it was an inexpensive tour (self guided) with huge value. I considered it a 'must see'!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222teresab
50,Loved the USS Iowa!,"We really enjoyed our tour of the USS Iowa. The staff was friendly and informative and we learned a lot about its role in World War II. My husband enjoyed the videos and my son enjoyed looking for Victory, the dog that had been stationed on the battleship. If you are a Navy buff you will enjoy your time on the USS Iowa. Also, if you are a current Iowa resident I was told you get in free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daisyj084
50,Fun Afternoon Activity,Awesome attraction for when you don't have an entire day to devote to something. The ship is in great condition and the volunteers were friendly and knowledgeable! Definitely another fun thing to do while learning some history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shawnnal2014
50,dont miss this! visit battleship uss iowa..,"Went there on fathers day. they had many returning navy vets and announced each name , rank etc as they entered the ship. it was an excellent, well organized and informative tour. I would certainly recommend it for both adults and children. (there is a bit of climbing and different levels..) nice gift shop and excellent former navy folk around to tell stories etc.would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tucsonfolks
40,Big guns,"You walk through the ship from level to level following the person ahead of you. Quite a few steep ladders/stairs to climb, which are even more difficult going down than up, so older people might have difficulty on this tour. The giant guns are formidable, and you can see how large the ammunition was. FDR was aboard this ship, and you can see his living quarters and meeting area. I enjoyed learning about the dog named Victory who traveled over 200,00 miles aboard the ship. It would be nice to have a few more displays and signs explaining the different parts of the ship. Gift shop at the end of the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/921jamesl
50,"Amazing battleship, a piece of history!","This was an absolute amazing experience. My husband really wanted to see this when we went to Long Beach last summer, and we are so happy that we did. They have kept it in pristine condition and it was so fun walking the various decks and seeing everything from the guns, to the crew's quarters. There were also many volunteers around the ship that would tell you various tidbits and answer your questions. Definitely do not miss this when you go! You can also get a combo discounted ticket to both the battleship and the aquarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshleySchulte
50,Best Experience in LA,"Hands down this is the best experience/museum/attraction in the LA area. It is incredible how much access you are given to truly explore the ""Big Stick,"" and they have more tours planned. For any history or navy buff, or any parent looking for a way to physically demonstrate and convey 50 years of American history to their child, the Iowa is a great idea. Consider taking a side trip this summer while you're at Disneyland, Hollywood or the beach; you will not regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travisschulte
50,The volunteers made this a great experince.,"Right from the begining I noticed that all the employees and voluneteers seemed like people who actually wanted to be there and loved what they do. I also appreciated that the voluneteers were ""old timers."" They were very knowledgable about naval ship history. They were all available to answer whatever questions I had. They made my visit great and I'd go back.As for as the ship is concerned that was also a great experience. This is a battle ship and not a air craft carrier like the USS Midway In San Diego. Because I had been on the Midway I was expecting something a little bigger, but it's not the fault of the ship. If anything, I learned something new about ships today.On my visit there were couples, familes, and veterans. I felt very welcomed and it is a good environment for all to attend. Me and my girlfriend spent 3 hours there. It is enough time to see the entire ship and visit the gift shop. Parking was $1 an hour, so $3 total for 3 hours wasn't bad at all. On a side note, your not far from the Ports O Call in San Pedro. You can go there after the USS Iowa and grab a nice sea food lunch. This was an excellent way to spend a Friday off of work. Weekends may get a little more crowded so I do recommend a weekday if you are able to visit then.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mindcontrol1
40,Big guns of Iowa,"If you're a history buff or just like big ships, this is one that should not be missed. The tour is pretty straight forward with arrows and signs guiding you through out the ship. The areas available to the public are a bit limited, no tours of engines or inside the turrets guns. But i'm sure it'll be available later down the line. The volunteers on board are very welcoming and gladly tell stories about the ship and it's long illustrious history. Will visit agan.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orange_advan
40,Impressive,This ship is impressive. It is bigger than I thought and the guns are way bigger than I imagined. The volunteers are very helpful and informative. Great on board displays and videos. Worth a look.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IowaRod
40,Bring your kids!,"This is one of those visits that you can't believe how good it is till you do it.I had seen the Missouri when it was moth-balled in Bremerton, before it moved to Pearl Harbor.I didn't know the Iowa was still on the Navy's books. With 3 months in dry dock it could be out on the seas again. And you will believe it when you see how good shape it is in.The docents, many of whom had served on board, were wonderful and excited about their work and the ship. The exhibits and videos are very good. The history associated with the ship is incredible of course. Even a bathtub added for President Roosevelt.You are only 10 minutes away from the Long Beach Aquarium and the Queen Mary so there is lots to see in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgeonwhidbey
40,Interesting until the very last minute,"This was the first time we saw a battleship like this and we were so impressed. Thanks to all the volunteers who explained everything to us! There was so much to see, from the guns to the kitchen and cafeteria. They also showed some movies which made everything so lifely. The view on the waterway, the harbour and the tower cranes was also fascinating. Backpacks are allowed and there are many benches on the desk, so you could bring your snacks and beverages and have a rest in the sunshine looking at the harbour.Some hints what to do afterwards:Drive to W Paseo del Mar where you have a nice view on the ocean and there are also very impressive residential areas. After that drive up the hill on S Gaffey St and you will find a vista point which will give you a breathtaking view on the harbour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosC172
50,So much history!,My husband and I really enjoyed visiting the Iowa. So much history and we learned so much. The volunteers are great and very knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhoppy
50,Must-see piece of history,"We thoroughly enjoyed our tour of USS Iowa! Once aboard, we were greeted by naval personnel, who briefed us about the self-guided tour. On the main deck, we were awe-struck by the sheer firepower of the vessel, from the massive guns to the Tomahawk missiles. Below deck, we were amazed by the tiny living quarters for the crew, yet we marveled at how the space is so efficiently arranged. We were particularly impressed by the Presidential exhibit, taking special pride in the fact that USS Iowa accompanied USS Missouri to enforce the surrender of Japan to end World War II. Above deck, we explored the Bridge and stood by the Captain's chair, imagining what it would be like to command such a vessel. At the end of the tour, we visited the small museum and gift shop, which were chock full of memorabilia and mementos. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W3710NUpatriciam
40,Worth to visit,"It's impressive to learn that this battleship served half a century - from WWII to Desert Storm.But what is even more amazing - the stuff - volunteers, who greet you, who explain what is what and what is for. They are priceless.I recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skytruck
50,Absolutely awe inspiring!!!!!,"I visited this on a whim while on a Disneyland vacation with the family. I went by myself on a Wed morning and was fortunate enough to be able to trail behind a couple of school groups and got to listen to the docents speak to the children. I was REALLY impressed with how patient the docents were with the children and how friendly they were. I learned so much about the USS Iowa just from listening to them talk to the school children. It is very obvious that the guys giving the tours really enjoy what they are doing!!While it is true that you do not really get to go into places like the engine room, the powder magazine, etc, there is more than enough to see in the areas that are open to the public. Examples include: the admirals bridge, the captains quarters, the captains bridge, up close with the phlanx missle defense system, Roosevelt's bath tub for when he visited the Iowa, crew quarters, crew mess, the main deck fore and aft, etc,etc....In terms of just sheer magnificence, I rank this right up there with Niagara Falls. This thing is huge! You don't get a true sense off it until you are on the upper decks overlooks those massive main guns.I am not a history buff and I easily spent 2.5 hours on the ship. This is something that I want to come back and see again!!!One thing I thought was really cool was that if you were a military veteran(and told them so), they would announce your rank, name and branch of service to the entire boat as you were boarding. What an incredible way to recognize our veterans!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tommM3628CM
50,I THANK HER for HER SERVICE !,"What a tremendous experience and honor to tour/visit this well-preserved battleship. There is an entrance fee ($15 for seniors) and an opportunity to donate additional monies. You may ask questions of the volunteers that work there. These volunteers were knowledgeable and interesting in their presentations. The entire ship was well restored. They do NEED to replace the wood flooring on the top surface....(hence, the donations). Go spend an hour or so, wear flats because there are many stairs and be prepared to enjoy this history lesson.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/39patriciaw
50,My Dad & I loved it!,The whole experience was incredible. We saw every level of the ship & found some great gifts in the shop. I drove two hours from Palm Springs & it was well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lh934
50,"Superb!!!!---""Amazing""","The fact that you get to walk on a ship that was in battle and rated the toughest ship in battle history, is priceless.Everything in this ship is easy to follow, well done, labeled and easy to guide yourself. On top of that, if you are curious like me, all the guide staff were veterans, very friendly and knowledgeable about everything, i found out that that ship takes 2.5 million gallons to even get out of the dock..Yup!!!. America in general just knows how to do tourism close to perfect and always provide the best experience with vast amount of info that is easy for anyone to follow and all the history when it comes to military history. Every state I have visited ""and I have been to almost half of the country"", I make sure to go visit a museum or something with history behind it, but this place is and will be one the best I have ever been to so far.Hats off to the men and women who go to war for our country. They sacrifice a lot for all of us.PS: Don't forget to buy a lot of gifts at their gift shop in the lower level of the ship and ""DONATE""--Don't be cheap----Be kind!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hill7777
50,Be Proud,If I was personally sent to war I would feel much better if I knew that I had the USS Iowa as my escort. This ship is amazing. The battles that it has been to. The many countries it has gone to. The people that it has transported. The men that ran this ship was awesome and I thank you for protecting freedom.It's very hard to describe what you will see here. You just need to go. Wear comfortable non slip shoes. Take lots of pictures. Spend time and talk to the crew. They are volunteer veterans. Understand what they went through. Donate to the cause.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickInOC
40,Great piece of US military history,"In my own backyard, I have neglected to visit until now. Went on this past Memorial Day, it was great to see retired vets throughout the ship, and regaling in the history of the Iowa class battleships, and learning more about the long service of the Iowa. If you are a Naval history buff at all, or just interested in learning more about WWII, this is a must see. It is a reasonably priced attraction that I would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueJetDude
40,Share the pride with our naval heroes,"The neighborhood is a bit out of my way for frequent visiting, but I bought a year-long membership anyway, just to support ""the troops."" The photos are astonishing, including ones of the Japanese formal surrender ceremony (which took place aboard the Missouri, not the Iowa). It is easy - too easy - to picture these young men (including my father) living on the last battleship of her class, leaving behind family and friends to keep us safe. There is no entertainment and some days the sun makes the deck broiling hot, but I would urge anyone visiting the Los Angeles area to make the hour-long trip down to the Iowa, if only to pay homage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77
50,Iowa Visit,I enjoyed the tour of the Iowa. It was interesting to see this battleship and pay tribute to the sailors who died tragically on this ship,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcapps111
50,Magnificent,"This was easily one of our best places to visit during our first visit to LA, excepting the visit to the Zamperini home in Torrance. This ship was phenomenal. I have, perhaps incorrectly, been led to believe the perfectness of the carriers, especially with our battleship opponents Yamato/Musashi. These Iowa-class battleships are brawlers and have a huge amount of history under their belts. Carriers were obviously the future (thank God the Japanese didn't recognize this and invested in the battleships), but I never knew that our battleships were this formidable. This is a must-see, and the guides were absolutely fantastic. They knew everything about the ship, and they jumped at the opportunity to help. This was much more different from our experience at Patriots Point, Charleston-SC -USS Yorktown-where they seemed to care less. The staff at Iowa was first class! They were easily the best organized and most motivated to help at any US historical site that I've visited (I've seen a few but I'm not an expert).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jolleyzoo
50,20th Century Leviathan,"Anyone with an interest in naval architecture or WW2 military history will find this new museum ship a fascinating experience.Moored at LA's port in San Pedro only since 2012, the Iowa was easy to visit. There are signs for the ship on I-110 and CA-47, as I recall. Dockside parking space was ample. The ticket office and restroom are dockside. (One of the docents commented to me that, despite the city's initial promises, LA had yet to hook up the ship properly with water and electrical services.) An adult ticket was $18.Tip: the ticket office and ship open at 10am promptly (listen for the sound of a ship's bell). Arrive 20 or so minutes early and spend the time walking the dockside along the length of the Iowa to gain an initial appreciation for the sheer size of the machine.Once on board, a well-thought-out walking route (including up and down a number of steep ladders) is marked clearly with guide ropes and yellow arrows on the deck. The brochure implies that eventually there will be a variety of more detailed tours offered. The current ""tour alpha"" route takes the visitor five levels above the main deck and one level below it. Look for the ""factory defect"" spalling on one of the barbettes, the unique bathtub, the memorial to the 1989 training accident, the marvellously thick armour of the conning tower, and the haze-grey basketball backboard.Note there are a few rough edges: some of the more modern weapons systems in place (all the Phalanx and half the Tomahawk launch boxes) are disappointingly just sheet-metal mockups; also, the worn exterior wooden deck (fir, not teak) is in quite sad shape.On the upside: although the tour is completely self-guided, there are a number of ex-Navy personnel on board who are very knowledgeable and a delight to talk with.Stopping frequently to take photos and read all the information plaques, the walking tour took me about three hours, stem to stern; I expect two hours might be more the average. There's a well-stocked, air-conditioned gift-shop on board, aft of the enormous crew's mess compartment.To summarize: exploring the USS Iowa was a great way to spend a morning. The ship is still in the process of being properly opened up for display, so I debated whether to assign 4 or 5 TripAdvisor bezants for the visit. Finally went with five; even with the gunhouses and engine rooms yet closed, and onboard facilities at a minimum, it was nonetheless well-worth the time and expense to see this epitome of mid-20th century battleship technology.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kay-cee-1138
40,Cool piece of history,"Not for the handicapped or elderly with difficulty navigating stairs. Don't bring your little kids if they can't climb STEEP stairs. If Grandma can't climb it your toddler can't either.I'm ot a history buff by any means, so when I was invited to attend a private event here, with admission to see a real battleship, I thought ""How cool is that!?""The gala was held on and off the IOWA, and the flight deck had plenty of room to move, socialize, and get food and drink.Keep in mind if you are going to do the tour of the ship, wear FLATS or sneakers. No heels, skirts or dresses, as you'll be climbing up and down ladders, hopping over high door frames, and squeezing into tight quarters. You'll burn a lot of calories, and once you start the tour, there's no real turning back until you're done. A couple 20 something y.o. women where whining about the stairs, and I had to just roll my eyes. This wasn't the Love Boat, but an actual battleship used in the 1940's.Throughout the tour, there were staff answering questions. I didn't really ask if they were former staff or volunteers but they had a wealth of information, and were very nice to chat with.At the end of the tour is the gift shop and a chance to see the photo they took of you in the beginning of the tour. There's donation boxes throughout the ship, and soda machines in 2 places. Oh, and a sign that says NO TOILETS available inside the ship.Overall a great tour. We took about 2 hours to view everything, and its a great way to appreciate what our Navy goes through to protect our Country.I think full price is $18 but there's always a groupon or coupon you can find for BOGO. Parking is $1 per hour, and you can pay with credit or cash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callmemochelle
40,Patriotic Day at the Battleship,"I visited the Battleship Iowa USS, very interesting to be on board a ship that was in battle. Hats off to the men and women who go to war for our country. They sacrifice alot for all of us. Touring the ship, I was in amazement of equipment of missiles, the steep stairs, small sleep areas, passage ways, Capitan's quarters, cafeteria area and how equipped the accommodations was but yet inadequately not livable to my terms. Definitely, pay respect to fallen military men and women and those who are still here. Please support the Battleship Iowa USS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelanieB122
40,A great way to waste time while waiting for your cruise ship,On embarkation day we went to this attraction and spent a good 1.5 hours enjoying the 'museum' and historical information given by the noties and the volunteers.It was most interesting from the point of view of a non American who did remember the war years.After this visit we waiting at the ramp enttrance and got on the HoHo tram which goes around the Los Angeles area free which was also interesting I wish we had had more time.However I do think that $15 for a senior for the USS Iowa was a quite steep price.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Prudence-kitten
50,Great Experience!,"On impulse, I took my boys to the USS Iowa last weekend (5/10). We had a blast! This is a really good museum and the walking tour allows you to see most of the ship and get a great idea of what living on a battleship must've been like. Make sure to bring a camera along since there is a lot to see an the area has improved since I was last here. If I understood the docents correctly, the ship is still on the Naval Register and technically in the reserve fleet so it could be recalled to active duty. Consequently, the ship is on lease to the non-profit managing it until 2020. They're not allowed to make modifications to the ship so, because of that, here's a few things to note when visiting:1. There are no bathroom facilities aboard ship. There are (actually clean!) portable toilets on the pier towards the stern and there are public park restrooms nearer the driveway towards the bow.2. There are no concession stands for food. Bring your own.3. Unfortunately, you can't see the engine room or get inside the gun turrets (yet)4. There are a lot of STAIRS. A lot of them. If you have an elder with you that uses a cane, walker or a wheel chair, they're only going to be able to get around the main deck. At the end of the tour, my boys and I were actually sort of bushed!Also, if you purchase tickets off their website, you'll get a small discount! The ship is berthed just north of Ports of Call so you can get something to eat there. There's also a little trolley that runs up and down the area. Overall, despite the fact that we couldn't yet see the whole ship, this was an excellent museum and my boys and I had a great time! I would highly recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W6633PYpauls
50,Pretty neat!,"It is a cool experience. The basic self guided tour is great, I wish there were more options to go deeper into the ship (or there might be and I just missed it.) Make sure anybody in your group is OK with climbing and descending the ship's ladders or their experience will be pretty limited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mik72
50,A sleeping giant!,"This is not ""The Blue Nose""! This is ""The Iowa"" with all its glorious guns and ammunition! Missing the full battle crew allows us to stroll the decks of this mighty beast wanting to ""fire the guns"" one more time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffp307
50,Great First-Hand Look at a Real Battlewagon,"I built a model of the U.S.S. Iowa when I was around eleven years old. Never thought I'd have the chance to actually walk her decks and look inside some of those windows. What a great trip! Truly amazing! The guides were friendly and knowledgeable, and the ship itself is breathtaking. Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GarryF510
50,my bday on USS IOWA.. fab day ...,"en-route to Australia we had a stopover in LA and coming from a navy family a visit to USS IOWA was a must, especially on my bday as the museum manager I contacted told me people have free admission on their bdays .Travelling with an infant, on a hot california day.. too hot for us coming from Ireland,.. and travelling the town on a saturday with public transport from Rebonbo beach we were delighted to see the grey hull of the ship when we got to San Pedro .the museum staff was welcoming and fantastic, and they help us with the baby who was 5 months and had to be carried in a sling all the tour whilst museum staff at the entrance took care of our pram. We really appreciated it and I must underline their kindness.The ship is a unique piece of history, well kept and I look forward to the day the turrets will be open to public.The ship s store offers many memorabilia at reasonable prices and the little bar restaurant offer good bites, in case ye are hungry .We really enjoyed the tour and I advised lots of people to visit her. It s a piece of history ....thanks for having us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paddystefano
50,Gotta See This,"In the days of electronics and 5-second attention spans, the USS Iowa is a tribute to all American Sailors. It is immaculately kept up, and the tour is very informative. It gives one an appreciation for the might of our Navy and for the history of the heroes that protected our Nation and the high seas.You get to walk all over the ship, and see where sailors both lived and worked. Parking is easy and it is not at all hard to get to. OK, so you are going to do Disneyland and maybe Rodeo Drive; but if you want to see something truly awesome, and a great learning experience, try this.God bless the U.S.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllenatHome1
40,I love battleships,"The only thing that prevents me from giving this an ""excellent"" is the fact that I've been to the USS Yorktown in Charleston, where much more of the ship was available to the public. Still, I was able to see a good amount of the USS Iowa. The staff were very friendly and informative, the ship was beautiful, and there were stunning views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/135daniellem
50,A historical ship,Going aboard this ship allows to experience it first hand. You get to see how seamen lived and were stationed. You are even allowed in bridge.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rysoong
40,Well worth the time aboard,"When you arrive at the Iowa you are looking at history, The docents greeted you as you came aboard, they told you what laid head on your tour, the first place that you saw was where president Roosevelt, stayed while on this trip to Yalta. Then you continued,on your tour, and saw how the ship was operated, and what each man, was doing thru the battles, they they were in, not only were on the this Battle Ship, but you were also looking at history. The docents really knew every thing about this ship and they were proud to tell its story, they would have taked about her all day given the chance. I am afraid of heights, and the docent that follow our group, help me to over come that problem, which may me enjoy the tour, that much more. My wife not being to much on going on this tour, at the end was saying how much she enjoyed it. This is a great family place to visit. Well worth the price that you had to pay, I would like to return and do it again. Thank you to the docents that were there to tell the story.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/popo45
50,USS Iowa,A great ship with a lot of history. The docents were very informative and really enjoyed what they were doing. It takes about 2-3 hours to go through the ship if reading the available information or viewing the movies and a little faster if just looking. Be aware that there are steep steps on some of the staircases but most people can manage if they take it easy. Parking is free and is right in front of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/old_dude_traveler
40,"Good start, with a bright future!","The ship is awesome, even if in need of some pretty serious renovation. The staff were incredible. Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable. TIP: Hit the restrooms before boarding the ship!! With continued reinvestment of proceeds, the exhibit should take shape nicely over the next several years. The immediate area doesn't offer much else to do, so try to combine this trip with a visit to the Aquarium of the Pacific in nearby Long Beach. (Skip the Queen Mary...not impressed!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevora490
50,Our Wonderful Day At The USS IOWA,"My husband and I had a lovely time aboard the Iowa. in fact, my brother served aboard the Iowa in 1957. He is now a retired officer of the US Navy. He also served aboard the Wasp. He took me aboard the Wasp but, I have never been on the Iowa. Thanks to your excellent tour lead J J we got to see the CIC (his position aboard ship). We took a good number of pictures. Since my brother and his family live on the east coast, I shall be sending him. Thank J J for us again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/690suep
50,Glimpse back in time.,Young and old can appreciate all the history. San Pedro is a great little town with some awesome pieces of our fine history in it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GabrielleM412
50,Informative and Entertaining - don't miss it,"We took a guided tour with a Boy Scout Troop. The staff also arranged a visit for us to the ships communication room so we could complete the Radio Merit Badge. The staff was very responsive and extremely helpful. The guided tour was great. The tour was very informative and entertaining. The trip to the communication room was spectacular. We learned Morse code and we were able to use the radios. The communication room staff also told us great stories about working on military ships, but they were also very informative giving us the science behind the technology. I would highly recommend this trip for a group or solo visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephenc223
50,Don't miss this piece of History!,It is great to have this treasure in San Pedro. We very much enjoyed touring the ship and seeing how our Navy service people lived and worked while at sea. I wish I had been able to tour it with my Dad who served in the U.S. Navy aboard a ship so he could give us his perspective of life aboard these great vessels. God bless our service people. Don't miss this great piece of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lonniet321
40,Great History Lesson,"A floating historical event. Wonderful to get a glimpse of what it might have been like to serve our country. Fascinating to see how the Iowa was modernized each time she was refitted. The docents were quite friendly and knowledgeable. Wish the tours were guided, however. Well worth the $$.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soberduud1
40,Impressive piece of history,"Good self-guided tour around the ship. Finding the ship's dog's pictures throughout the ship was a fun ""treasure hunt"" for the kids. The parking lot fee is pricey. Plan to spend several hours to roam around the ship. There are no restrooms available on the ship, so be sure to use those outside before entering (there are signs to remind you!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/islandreams
50,Awesome Experience for Kids and Adults,The Iowa has a rich history which comes to life with a visit. The ship's abilities and missions were complemented by the on-board information and the optional paid docent led tours. All the volunteers and docents were very knowledgeable and accomodated question after question while keeping the 1.5 hour tour moving.The tour is easy for those that are mobile. The access for wheel chairs and those of limited mobility isn't easy and greatly limits the visit.I went twice; once with my seven year old and again with my cub scout pack of 44. Each time was excellent.I was amazed by the number and variety of visitors from all over the world visiting this jewel. The location and parking are extremely easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/461alh
50,old warrior,What a great experience. This ship is a treasure for all to share for generations to come. The only place where you can see the last active battleship as she last served.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamese721
50,USS Iowa - Great Visit!,"I'm a history fan and in particular, love WWII. When I discovered the Iowa was berthed nearby, I was ecstatic! The Iowa class battleship is really something to see and if you have the time, go see it. I took my French girlfriend (who is not a fan of war related things) and even she loved the ship! We walked the ship on our own, which was probably a mistake - the tour guides were very knowledgeable from what we overheard. However, even walking the ship by yourself, there are signs all over to tell you what you're looking at and lots of staff all about to tell you interesting facts and snippets about the boat. Surprisingly, just when we were done and were about to leave, we spoke with a security guard and spent a good 20 - 30 minutes talking with him. Even the security personnel love this ship and know lots of interesting facts.What you should know - no tax dollars go towards the preservation and restoration of the ship. It's all off of donations and ticket fees. The people operating and securing the ship are all volunteers (at least, everyone we talked to were). If you have ever seen photos of this ship, they don't do it justice. Wait until you stand next to any of it's massive 16"" guns and you'll be glad you visited! There are NO bathrooms on board the ship but there are some before you board. I recommend using them before boarding since you'll probably stay on the ship for at least 2 - 3 hours...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Real_Atticus
40,Awesome,I really enjoy the self guided tour. Had something for young and old. Myself as old and grandson which is eight. Great piece of American history which hopefully will be around for many more generations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadking0598
50,Great Haze Grey Memory,"After serving in the US Navy for 22 years, it was great to get back about a US Navy Warship. Part way through I remarked to my family that it even smelled the same as the ships I was stationed on that I remember smelling a particular aroma from a Naval vessel especially when I came off two weeks leave and was re-introduced to the smell of a ship! The onboard staff were great!!!! I had been on the Missouri in Pearl, so I was expecting the same...the only unfortunate part is that Iowa has not been in the LA basin as long at the Mighty Mo has been in Pearl...so some of the areas...engineering etc were not open yet, and as an EMCS, I was hoping to see some of the snipe world. I have signed up for a membership, so hopefully relatively soon, we can get to where the snipes play! Even with that, myself, wife, daughter, son in law and two grandsons had a great time and we look forward to going back again!!! And did I mention, we went for my birthday and I was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa. emcsswusn",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/douglasw417
50,A must see in the Long Beach CA area,Thankful that San Pedro offered space to dock BB-61. Sadly too many of our fleet have been cut up for scrap iron or can be found rusting adjacent to the Venicia Bridge in northern CA. It's surely a lot closer to visit than the North Carolina that we toured a number of years ago. Reading of the training explosion reminds us that accidents can happen even in peace time. We highly recommend spending 90 minutes to tour this local flagship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrygilbert
40,Great addition to the community,"Thanks to all who made the USS Iowa in So Cal possible.I was impressed with how well the ship has been preserved, especially the paint on the outside. I had hoped to tour the main battery and engine spaces, realize that the ship is evolving as a historical destination. So I will continue to talk up the ship with my friends, and help the cause.Our singles conference at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints rented out the fantail for a conference in May, so that will introduce another 750 people to the ""Big Stick"" and it is great how the USS Iowa can become part of our community with events like this held on the ship.The self guided tour is well instructed with signage. Just enough signs with information to educate us. I had built a WW2 model of the Wisconsin, so I was fascinated by all the cold war upgrades. The bridge and armored citadel were awesome. There is a lot to take in. I prefer the real deal to The Queen Mary tour which has lots of museum junk in it where the Iowa shows off the power and mission of the ship itself. The ""museum"" phase was kept tastefully small next to the gift shop.Keep up the marketing and buzz around the Iowa. Best Wishes for continued restoration and success,Mark",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ForwardObserver
50,Great way to see history up close,"Excellent visit to this floating museum. Lots of informative volunteers and interesting exhibits. Good for history buffs, people interested in the navy/military, and US history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/423jonathanb
20,To Much Monet For So Little To See!,You don't get to see enough of the interior of the ship. Not even a glimpse of the engine room. I took my grandson. We were very disappointed .It is not worth it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doradodick
40,A Wonderful Piece of History,I really enjoyed the USS Iowa. I learned so much about this and other battleships. It is set up for that time period so in certain areas you will see games and such for that period of time. The quarters are tight and a lot of up and down. As much as I was intrigued my little guy wasn't as quite. He enjoyed and was excited but it got a little boring and we weren't moving fast enough. I wanted to see and read everything.There is a store inside and a lot of fun things inside. You can even have a dog tag created with what ever you want on it.It was a fun day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariofgod
50,Awesome tour of the USS Iowa,"I won a VIP guided tour of the USS Iowa in a MyCokeRewards sweepstakes. Having toured the USS Wisconsin and USS Missouri, I anticipated a similar tour experience. Boy was I wrong! Our guide was Jon Reed, and we quickly discovered that Jon, while not a former sailor, was super knowledgeable about this ship, it's history, and how it operated. Although I took 242 pictures (all of which turned out great, thank you Canon 6D), I wish I had taken more. In a few years I'll be back for another tour - hopefully additional areas of the ship will be opened up by then. It is a work in progress but what's already accessible is awesome. I'd like to walk down the passageway that runs the length of the ship!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkB221
50,field trip,I took 52 first graders on a field trip to the Iowa and they had the time of their life. Our tour guide Randy was amazing with so many little ones. We also had the opportunity to eat in the mess hall and visit the well stocked gift shop. This will be an annual field trip for my students. I also had tons of question prior to the trip and Shannon helped out with every one of them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/83ryanl
40,Interesting and impressive!,"Truly awesome! We spent a few hours walking around, looking around corners, down stairways and watched a doco/movie. We were greeted by a friendly and helpful docent. There were docents at different places throughout the self-guided tour. You can ask questions and take photos to your heart's content. You can go at your own pace. Some of the passageways were narrow-as were the stairs (ladders almost).The tour includes the deck, right next to the 'big guns', you got to go up to the captain's quarters, where Presidents stayed and saw the bunks where the sailors lived.It really brought home the sacrifices that men have made in their service to our country!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RAMspeed
10,Worst experience ever,We bought a package at the queen Mary and we arrived at the gate at 4pm and they would not let us board. Now we will not be able to use our tickets as we fly out in the morning,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/th3truth
50,Great time had by Santa Clarita Valley Business Group!,"SCVBG had approx. 80 of its members travel to the Iowa this past Sunday and we all had a blast! Our large group was divided into three smaller and manageable groups that were lead by some of Iowa's docent guides for almost 2 hours. In particular, Jim Gauderman and Mike Herschman were fantastic and were able to share many stories and interesting facts regarding the ship. All, but one of us, had never been on the ship before so it was a real thrill and privilege to share in Iowa's storied history. The ""wow"" factor was huge and many of us are looking forward to a return visit. Thank you to the ship's Group Sales Dept, J.J. Johnson, and the rest of the crew for such a warm welcome aboard!!Sincerely,The SCVBG",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/961jeffa
50,Fabulous…..,"I organized a cub scout trip to the Iowa and we were entitled to a tour guide - Romero, who was a fount of information. The boys and adults had a blast as we explored all over the Ship. Our tour took about 2 hours and then we had time to wander around ourselves. Definitely worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairebH2739YG
50,A piece of history to explore,"A great piece of history to explore. Lots of very steep steps, so be sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes. A large Naval ship you can self tour with docents along the way to answer questions. Educational and some fun for the whole family. Bring your camera and you can gets some great shots on ship and a great shot of the Vincent Thomas Bridge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannem978
40,An Interesting Visit,We really enjoyed the visit on the USS Iowa. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. They want to open additional parts of the battleship in the near future. We would definitely consider going again when these new parts are open to the public.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarkMZ
50,"Great visit, wonderful history",We had a great visit to the USS Iowa. It was well worth the cost and completed our visits to all four Iowa class ships that are open as museums. Happened to be there on it's commission date anniversary and the celebration was complete with brass band.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lola2104
50,Student field trip,"Our trip to the USS Iowa was fantastic. Staff was great to work with, both in arranging the trip and onsite. Students enjoyed the experience and learned a lot especially from the docents, who were excellent. Highly recommended for middle and high school students.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/777micheled
40,Boy Scout Outing to the USS IOWA,"The ship is very impressive, the history is great as well. Our Boy Scout troop had a very good time touring the ship. I believe once the other levels of the ship are open as well as the engine room the tour will be spectacular. I felt the tour was a bit short, but worth every penny.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/875charlesm
40,Buy Iowa online with Queen Mary ticket,"We enjoyed our visit to the Iowa--the second Iowa-class ship we saw on a recent vacation. (We visited the Missouri in Hawaii a month before). Upon arrival, they ask if anyone in the group is a veteran. If so, they welcome that person by name, rank, branch and dates of service over a loudspeaker. Very nice! The Iowa has a rich history of presidential visits/stays, and it was interesting visiting the Presidential suite. There were many photos of presidential visitors and interesting things to read about the ship and visitors. Like the Midway in San Diego and the Big Mo in Hawaii, the Iowa has many volunteers who served on the ship. Wish we would have had time for their stories. There are a couple of videos to watch that are interesting. The signage isn't excellent, thus the 4-dot rating, and you are charged to park by the Harbor Authorities--out of the Iowa's control, unfortunately. (Even the volunteers have to pay to park). If you want to also visit the Queen Mary, buy a combo ticket online--you'll save money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an2net_10
50,Great people and great battleship!,The whole place was amazing. The people working there were very friendly and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend the USS Iowa. It's great for kids and adults alike. The only warning I give is to beware of the stairs. There are steep stairs there so it might be difficult for toddlers and the elderly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coptforlife
50,ginormous,"we didn't go on because I think it costs like $20 bucks? but we admired it from the dock, and it's quite a sight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kath1031
40,Great History!,"The ship was impressive, but the stories told by the former sailors/volunteers on board really brought it home. Ask questions and take advantage of the stories they have to share.The tour is self-guided, and in order to see the entire ship you will need to climb up and down very steep, narrow stairs. There are no public restrooms on the ship, but there are port-a-jons in the parking lot.At the end there is a gift shop with snacks and commemorative items for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CanyonGirly
40,Very Impressive indeed,"I am not at all a war buff, but this was a pretty impressive sight. You can watch all the documentaries that you want, but until you get up close to one of these things it's hard to comprehend the size and fire power of this thing. The staff along the way were very informative as well, and the historical significance of this ship is also something very special. I had meant to visit this site on previous visits to the area, and had alway been disappointed that I had not gotten there.Well worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Inspectorfong
50,Well worth the trip,What a war machine!! Awesome Battleship. The tour was just incredible. Watch your head!its docked in San Pedro not far from the cruise ship dock.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonystewart14
40,Fun and Informative,"This is a marvelous site to visit and really enjoyed the visit. The docents have a wealth of knowledge, the sections that are open on the ship tell a lot about armaments, the ship itself, its voyages and battles and why it is historically important. You can see the armaments, the 1980's updates to weaponry, the living quarters and messes of both enlisted men and officers, the messes of both and see some of the missile launchers. This battleship was called the Big Stick and, looking at its 16-inch turrets, it's was to see why.Be sure to spend some time in the section where President Roosevelt stayed - and read about the William D. Porter and its round of incompetence.We enjoyed this visit but the ship is getting every better every day as they are working to open up more areas: the bridge, the engine room, the navigation rooms, etc. When these are open, it will be a 5.There are a lot of stairs and ladders to climb both up and down. There are no bathroom facilities on the ship but there are a few kybos outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyF406
40,A definite jewel for the LA Harbor,"LA did good by getting this ship here as a museum. These ships have so much history behind them. I enjoyed walking around and looking at everything. Since it is somewhat new, they are constantly working on different areas of the ship to expand the tour experience. The gift shop was done nicely and had a great selection of items.When I arrived, I met this docent named Don. He was such a nice guy and was telling me things about the ship. You can tell he really loves sharing with people. Also, I saw several of the other crew members in action and they care about their ship and the fact that you have a nice experience onboard. A very dedicated team of people !Go see the ship. You will enjoy it !Joe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lwjontheroad
50,Educational and interesting,"Take a look at how a WW II Battleship felt and looked. Great to spend a couple of hours, watch the onboard video.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
50,EXCELLENT SELF GUIDED TOUR OF FAMOUS BATTLESHIP,"Very informative self guided tour of the most famous USS battleship. There were helpful docents around to supplement the tour, which takes about 1 to 2 hours. You scramble around the decks and see information pertinent to the massive 26 mile range guns, living quarters, decks, food service areas, etc. This was also the ship that carried FDR to important WWII conferences in Cairo and Tehran.The trip TIPS: Bathroom facilities are substandard don johns; cost for seniors Iis only $15; gift shop is comprehensive; parking is $1 per hour; parking is not a problem it is right onsite; if you have trouble getting around this is not the tour for you because you climb numerous steep ship ladders, both up and down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAChuck
50,Great tour loved the historical data.,"I enjoyed the tour, you were able to tour the ship at your lesiure and there were knowledgable people who could provide additional insight into various asspects of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emge1
50,Second Tour was better than the First!,"I was at the IOWA the day she opened to the public...it was a wonderful experience for my entire family. My brother served aboard IOWA, so the tour had a special meaning for all of us. This year I went back again, and was simply amazed at all of the improvements that the volunteers had made over the years. This tour is worth every single moment for young and old...anyone who ever imagined what it was like to serve aboard a US BATTLESHIP will get the real deal during this tour. It is an amazing adventure for the young and old alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Markate47
40,A taste of history (after your cruise),"When you return to San Pedro after your cruise, you will see the USS Iowa berthed just across the parking lot. (In fact, you probably all snapped pictures of it as your cruise ship set sail a week ago!)On your way out of the customs/baggage terminal, stop at the booth and pick up one of the free flyers about the battleship -- it is good for discounted admission to the Iowa. We only had to pay $10 per person. Also, if this cruise was a birthday celebration, then the celebrant gets in free.Once aboard, you will tour a little bit of the interior, including the quarters where President Roosevelt and his staff stayed during a daring transatlantic voyage during WW2. You will also get to tour some of the upper decks as well. Be warned, there are some very steep stair/ladders, so this tour is not for those who cannot get around well.This battleship was state of the art in WW2, and actually served up into the Cold War. It is full of history, and kind of gives you goosebumps to stand on its famous decks!It is a great way to end your cruise..... just exit the customs terminal, load in your baggage, and then drive to the other end of the same parking lot.It makes you feel like you added one more fun shore excursion to your itinerary.There is a very cool museum store before you exit the ship. Buy something!By the way, use the bathrooms that are outside of the ship, by the ticket office. There are no public facilities onboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhilaFred13
40,Pay Homage to our past,"Even though it is still possible for her to be called back into active duty, her temporary station in Los Angeles is great.The guides that speed their time share stories are really nice. Be prepared to climb some steep ladders and descend too. Well worth the trip and glad to see they are still restoring her.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigF256
50,A walk through history,"I recently took the tour with a couple of friends. It was a great experience. When they say, ""They don't make 'em like this anymore."" it's an understatement with respect to this battle ship!I highly recommend it for young or old. They'll both get a lot out of the tour for quite different reasons.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potbelly5000
30,"Geting better, still a ways to go.","I went to see the Iowa about a year ago and I thought that by now it would be much better. Not so much. They have been open now over 1-1/2 years and you would expect more. At least there should be running water! You still have to use outhouses on the pier if you need the restroom. They have been open 1-1/2 years now and you'd expect a few more exhibits. Not much is open below the main deck.When we were there, there was a production company filming for a movie or a TV show. We were informed ahead of time that a few of the rooms would be closed. This wasn't much of a disturbance, just a few times you needed to step over all of their electrical cables.We were there on a Wednesday afternoon from about 3:00 until closing. We did not run across one single person that asked how we were doing or someone that we could ask a question to. Other than the guy that greeted us when we came on the ship and the guy that told us goodbye at the end of the day, no one said a thing to us. Very said to think that there aren't volunteers that want to w2alk around and talk to their paying guests.So if you want to see some big guns and the rest of the impressive weapons on board, this is the trip for you. Lots of neat stuff. But if you want to have an enjoyable time talking to volunteers and getting a sense of how navy life was on a battleship, perhaps you should wait a while to visit. Right now it's pretty bare-bones. You can tell they are trying but it's going to be a while before they catch up to other museum ships. The WWII cargo ship just down the street, the Lane Victory, has lots more to see and many more guys that are willing to talk to you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalGuy101
50,Living History!,"Museums are one thing, but this is real, living History.I am so glad I decided to switch plans for my limited time in LA to see the Iowa instead of the touristy and expensive Queen Mary. I was thrilled to see this wonderful ship and felt honored to be aboard her. Had a great personal tour from one of the volunteers. He really knew his stuff and enjoyed sharing with us.The day I was there, a TNT film crew was shooting on board, so I didn't get to see the Captain's quarters, but it was still a great tour. I realize the ship has only been open for a short while and that much of it is still inappropriate for tours, but you still get a great overview of the ship. I will definitely return to see her again when, hopefully, more areas have been prepared for viewing. Great job, so far, guys and gals!As others have mentioned, this ship is the real deal and that environment requires some steep Navy ship ladder climbings, both up and down, plus low hatches with high thresholds at the bottom that you have to be sure and step over. If you can physically accommodate that, just go with the flow and realize where you are - inside a fantastic piece of our military and political history!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaguarFeather
50,great ship,The Iowa offers a great tour. We always opt for a personal tour and not the ear piece tours. The man that took us around knew a great deal about the ship and fielded all of our questions. It is well worth your time and money.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Continent8
50,great exhibits,"touring this ship is a great experience. I have a picture I took of the main guns pointing right at me as my computer background. lots of climbing, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedml
50,Excellent museum and living exhibit,"We had a great tour of the battleship, which only opened last year. We were lucky and went when it was quiet, right at closing time, and got a private guided tour with Doug, who was doing a final 'sweep' of the place. Even on its own, the ship is grand and exudes history and has an imperiousness and grandeur that you can feel from the size of the ship, as well as the massive guns and serious armor.The ship has great exhibits and a self-guided path through most of the ship (all the important parts are seen) and we were told they're working to improve the tour, adding new areas as they are refurbished, and even adding some helicopters to the helo deck.This is a great museum for both adults and children alike and well worthy of the 1-2 hour distraction.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/472louisl
50,Humbling,"I'm certainly not a military buff, but the USS Iowa is extremely impressive -- as are the men who showed such knowledge and passion when they explained the features and history. Lives have been lost on this ship, and I was humbled at the sacrifices that were made. It is certainly more than a museum, and the docents showed great respect for the ship and the servicemen. A huge history lesson for me! ( Iowa residents are admitted with no charge -- but with opportunities to donate.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicer12
40,Nice Surprise in San Pedro!,If you love Naval history this is a great place to spend the day. The staff here really love what there doing and it shows. I loved the tour and loved all the history of the USS Iowa. There were so many changes from it's launch in 1943 and 1991 when she was retired that I wonder why she ever was retired. wow She was an impressive ship with so much history like the only bath tub in the fleet which was added for President Roosevelt's visit. So much to learn and enjoy....be prepared for a visit full of steps and the ducking of your head if you're over six feet tall..... wear comfortable shoes and sun screen too....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cookbookguy
40,Naval History Comes Alive,"It was wonderful visiting the U.S.S. Iowa! We took advantage of having a docent guide to show us around. Most, including ours, are former Navy and really know their stuff. They is much to see and they are still restoring additional areas, once funding and time can be found. Be aware of ladder steps and high thresholds while going through. I would not recommend this for those who have trouble walking. Our only concern was after the 2 1/2 hour guided tour we needed a restroom (only on the shore) and wanted time to explore the wonderful gift shop and see the film. Perhaps the volunteer guides could be a little more aware of the time constraints and be sure to let people have this time at the end. ... They are doing a great job with the Iowa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Twinder
40,Interesting trip,"The ship is in good shape, the volunteers are nice, the information is good.I didn't enjoy 100% because there is no access to the most interesting areas, like the turrets or the boilers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutilante
40,Great old lady!,"Wonderful to see this great ship. Be prepared for lots of stairs, some very steep like ladders. I look forward to additional areas of the ship being open in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RH631
50,Thanks for saving the USS Iowa,"Truly amazing ship, what awesome firepower and the history this ship holds. The personnel on board (volunteers) answer all your questions and are friendly retired (mostly) Navy men that you could spend hours just learning about the USS Iowa. Saved from an ignoble fate in June 2011, she was towed from San Francisco to San Pedro to see new life as a public museum. This amazing ship has now been saved and is now part of history to be shared with all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brownman58
50,Go Iowa Go,"The USS Iowa is a magnificent ship. If you are a fan of Military history, this is the trip for you. I would strongly recommend using this as a field trip to teach WWII history. I took my high school basketball team on the tour and they left with a deeper appreciation of what sacrifices our armed forces make to provide us with the freedoms we have. Our tour guide was awesome, was entertaining and very knowledgeable. This is a great activity to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickp803
50,A military history buff's dream!,"If you're a fan of maritime history, military history, WWII history in particular, the wonderful town of San Pedro, or just being on the waterfront....or, like me, all of the above, you'll love the battleship U.S.S. Iowa (BB-61). As an American military veteran (U.S. Air Force, but two of my cousins were Navy, including one during WWII, and my Dad was a WWII Marine), I find this exhibit especially appealing. I've been to my fair share of floating museums, but this one is especially impressive. I've done the tour twice, once with an Army veteran, the other time with a current USMC Reservist, and they both dug it as well. Seeing the 16-inch main gun turrets up-close-and-personal is amazing to behold. The computerized battle simulation belowdecks is exciting, and the gift shop has some neat selections. With ""the greatest generation"" (WWII generation) dying off rapidly, that makes this tour that much more poignant and timely, a fitting tribute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrojanSkyCop1
40,Awesome.,"Having grown up reading books about military firepower, I just had to come and see the Iowa in person. I wasn't disappointed. By neither was my accompanying friend, who had no prior interest in the ship. The sheer size of the Iowa and its unique history was enough to fascinate. Former sailors are on hand to talk to you about their own experiences, and this was arguably the best part of the tour, as you really get a first hand account of life on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TangoDj
50,WWII buff,I took my best friend to visit the mighty USS Iowa. It is free on your birthday. Go on your birthday ($16 savings). Buy the greatest WWII ever in the gift shop: Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors by James Hormfischer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baseballcardassassin
40,Worth a visit,"We have toured 2 of the other 3 Iowa class battleships ( Missouri and Wisconsin). This tour allowed entrance to some unique areas. The ex-marine that talked to us at several sites on the ship was very informative and had some interesting stories. It's not really a guided tour, but he showed up at several spots. You do a fair amount of climbing on narrow stairs. Plenty of parking right across from ship ( pay). The area has other attractions worth seeing and some great seafood places( try the fish market restaurant).No restrooms on board, but free public ones right outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nabman11
40,Plenty of Big Guns Here,We parked near this magnificent ship when we docked with our cruise ship when we visited LA. You will need a couple of hours to appreciate this exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FarEastTraveller33
50,Interesting tour,"Outstanding tour of this battleship. Because we are from Iowa, we were given free admission. It took about 2 hrs but we went everywhere we could and learned a lot about life at sea on a ship like this. There were veterans stationed around the ship to give great information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lemon60
50,History brought to life,"We thoroughly enjoyed the self-guided tour of the USS Iowa battleship. There are docents scattered throughout the tour along with informational placards. What's nice about it is you can go at your own pace....they open up new sections of the ship as time goes by & when funds arrive to refurbish these areas. The exhibits & gift store were phenomenal! Note: if anyone in your party is in a wheelchair or has severe mobility issues, check before driving down there as there are lots of climbing up & down stairs, it is, after all, a military ship....enjoy!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdenoi
50,Best ship tour ever!,If you can grab a docent please do. We were on homeschool tour so we had a docent and they were so knowledgeable! About the ship and the Naval involvement in all the wars. I went the Monday before our visit just to check it out as they recommended and happened upon a docent that was on the bow and asked him question. This lead to others and I am happy to say I was on the bow alone for over an hour! Doug was really awesome! When I came back on Friday with our group Doug was one of our guides again and he did another bang up job and even curtaintaled the information so that the littliest ones weren't bored and the older kids were inthralled!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debieb2013
40,"Nice visit, lots of potential","We stopped in San Pedro to see the USS Iowa on the way up to LA for a week. My husband really wanted to see it, so we went on a Saturday afternoon after driving from AZ. I purchased tickets online the day before, so we had no hassle getting in, and it was a quiet day. No bathrooms onboard so make sure you stop before you get on(there are some near the ship)Nice self guided tour with arrows marking your route. Various plaques telling you about items. The inside quarters have more info about the ship with old pictures, maps of its routes and military volunteers available to answer questions you may have. They were great! Very knowledgeable as they had served on similar ships and knew exactly what they were talking about. Easy and delightful to talk with, we enjoyed everyone we met. My husband had hoped to see below deck, but it is a work in progress, so we hope to return someday. My 12 year old daughter found it interesting where everybody got to sleep. Not always the most spacious space. Would recommend and would go back when more is opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dme3
50,Every child should take the tour!,Many children have little concept of war and how brave our sailors were in WW II. The Battleship Iowa and the docents were terrific in explaining the history of the battleships.The tour is not for persons that can not climb or descend steep stairway.It is a work in progress and more areas of the ship will open in the future.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Battleship Iowa,"This was a great way to see and learn about WW II history. The self tour was easy to follow and there were vets through out the ship to tell us about select areas. We went on a Monday, which seemed to be a slow tour day, so we were able to really talk to the gentlemen. Even though only parts of the ship were open to the tour, we got a good sense of how the sailors lived and worked on the ship. The areas we toured were the gun area, bunks, mess, bridge, captains quarters, nav room, outside decks, and med room. There is a lot of steep stair climbing, no elevators. Also, no restrooms on board but port a potties next to ship. An added bonus for us: Ironsides was being filmed that day on board so we were able to watch production for awhile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pata590
50,Great Must See!,"After the disappointment of the Q-M this was fantastic!!!Greeted by enthusiastic staff we where given a brief rundown on the self tour then off we went, followed the well marked course which led us to all that was interesting about this ship with the exception of our 7yr old who was in a mood we all had a great time and learnt alot about the battle ship at some points we could speak to knowledgeable staff about the ins and outs.Great end to the day very happy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Majak168
50,Amazing,Think you'll be bored think again.Had an amazing few hours wandering round the shipThe self tour is set out well with some lovely people at selective points to tell you about the area.Met a vet who actually served on board in the 50s what a lovely chap.Top tip don't wear open toed footwear. There's a lot of climbing involvedYou can even get a snack and each in the mess hall,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chatterbox324
40,Wonderful experience,"After staying a night in Long Beach we decided to take the short ride over to see the USS Iowa. It's not everyday you get a chance to see a Battleship. Tours are $18 per person. We were short on time and heading up the coast that day so we did not take the tour. Later we felt that we should have. Still, a spectacular sight, just looking at this beast from the outside. I hope that one day I will be able to return and give the Iowa proper attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AudKat
40,BB61 Visit,There was more to see than expected at the Iowa. The videos and signs helped explain the workings of the weapons systems aboard the ship. Also the docents were very knowledgeable and friendly and answered our questions completely. This was well worth our time as we were Navy veterans and had questions that most people would not ask but were not disappointed.I would recommend this attraction to all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Navy-Nam-Vet
40,Fun place to see,This was a really cool thing to see while we were visiting in California. It was a really big ship and you got to see how the navy lived on the boat in WWII. There was a lot to explore on the boat and we really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/416LisaC416
50,FABULOUS TOUR,"We were a small group who hired a private tour guide for $75.00. We had Joe and Lew and it was fabulous!! I don't think that doing it your own even compares to their stories and knowledge, both being ""Navy guys"" and had general knowledge that added to their extensive knowledge of the Iowa. Ladies will also enjoy the tour, as many of our group were women. It's a So Cal find! I agree that the stairs are a little difficult, but worth the trouble. Some of us went down backwards as well. It is not however, wheel chair friendly. You must have reasonably good mobility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bufnbill
50,USS Iowa is a great attraction.,There is nothing to dislike about the USS Iowa other than it is a little difficult to climb down sharply angled steps but you can always go down backwards which is much easier. There are plenty of people on-board who help explain the ship as well as movies and displays. This is well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAnn9
40,So much to see,Our first time on anything bigger than a frigate. We got there just after opening and it was very quiet which meant we had a ton of time to read and view everything at our own pace.I boosted my partner up onto one of the main guns for fun. Not sure if we were allowed but it made for a great photo.There is plenty of info and history on board. Give yourself at least 2-3 hours to get around. They have not yet opened up the engine room or much below deck but they are planning to do so over time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/647DanielR
40,Good start to what could become a wonderful museum and area,"Compared to many of the other naval ship museums throughout the US, this one is probably one of our least favorite experiences due to the surrounding area and construction, but is a good start to what could become a wonderful museum and area and worth a stop. History buffs will thoroughly enjoy being on board due to it's rich WWII History. Tickets range from $10 to $18 and admission and donations will help improve the Pacific Battleship Center. Parking in the lot right next to it is only $1 per hour. There are already quite a few seafood restaurants just down the road on the Port of LA waterfront within walking distance so it was the perfect place to spend a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutha2s
40,"Great museum, lot's of work still to do","My son and I visited the Iowa on a Saturday, it was our first time. I did not get that ""welcome aboard"" feeling like I do when I visit the Midway in San Diego. There is not clearly posted direction signs how to get in. The signage is kind of ""rag tag"" or homemade. I certainly understand that nothing's free in life and as the museum gains popularity, things will improve. Once on the ship, it is breathtaking-the magnitude of the weaponry on and above the main deck. The tour only lasted about an hour, maybe 1.5 hours, ending in the ship's store. I hope they have plans to open more of the interior up to the tour. All in all, it's a great tour and well worth the price paid. We'll return from time to time to see the (any) progress.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scubarich99
40,Preserve our U.S. history,"The USS IOWA has an amazing number of docents on board to assist you and help with questions. We were amazed at how many visitors there were for a Monday morning after Labor Day. As the ship depends on admission fees and private donations to maintain its accessibility as a tourist destination and restore more areas for visitors, one might find the visit just a little restricted at this time (especially if you have been on board other battleships), but be patient with the process and appreciate what you will see, the history you will learn, and the care and love those involved seem to have for the ""big stick"". . To walk through the area where FDR was housed while on board was eye opening. Also, this ship was one of the ships chosen to be in the harbor for the surrender of the Japanese. There is a small display revealing that information--if you are a family member of one who was aboard on that day and you have that red card which the sailors received for ""being there"", do consider donating it to the USS IOWA. If you can't walk well or do stairs, obviously this is not the ship to visit. It is a self-conducted tour--follow the arrows on the ground, but as previously mentioned, there are plenty of guys to answer questions along the way. Don't be put off by the guy who wants to take your picture with that ""scenic"" background--just have some fun and then decide at the end if you want to make the purchase--no pressure, really. Great gift shop with helpful but not pushy sales people. There are no rest rooms on board---blue booths on the dock, if you know what I mean....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/auntjj_12
50,Gave me goosebumps!,I served in the US Navy and wanted to share some of it with my daughters. They enjoyed every bit of it! The history of this ship is mind blowing and being able to explore her was just amazing! We enjoyed our tour so much we plan to visit again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavyDevilDoc
50,Makes Me Proud,"Took my two grown sons and grandson to this great ship a couple of weekends ago and we all had a great time!! Both my sons are World War II buffs and they were both impressed with the self guided tour and exhibts. Retired military men stationed around the ship gave us wonderful stories and insights into living and working on the Iowa. Seeing the captain's cabin with the bath tub installed for FDR was very cool! Just an FYI, there are lots of steps so be prepared. Not for toddlers since steps are steep. There are plans for an audio tour and accessibility tour in the works. Definitely a must see!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CA_Traveler-7
50,Battleship USS Iowa Tour,"The tour was guided by a very knowledgeable retired military personnel. The ship is huge and it takes a while to see it all. It is fascinating to see something that has been in wars and even shows some areas where it was hit in battle. Our tour included a box lunch in the ""mess hall"" that was very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barb125
50,Great time,"All self guided, very easy, like the fact that they had gentlemen on there that had been there .They also were in the uniform of the branch which they served, ie Marines and Navy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/722gregoryp
40,"Great for all.....Young, Old, Civilians & ALL","Went with my DH, SIL & BIL. My DH and his brother (BIL) are big ""military & history"" buffs. Needless to say, we were all blown away by the USS Iowa! To actually walk on the ship and see all the weapons, living quarters & ""battle station"" was like walking back in time. You will not be disappointed and if you get your tickets through ""Groupon"" or similar.....you can get on for half-price, although full-price is well worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marycE1319VN
30,Ship still opening areas,"A visit to the Iowa is a good opportunity to get a great history lesson on global conflicts starting w/ WW 2 and ending in the cold war w/ Russia. USS Iowa was there. Ship is in the process of developing 3-4 more tour routes over next few years and will be working on replacing the wooden deck, probably w/ Douglas fir which replaced the original teak decking. A worth while visit. It has only been opened for 13 months and will certainly add more spaces to visit as time goes on. No restrooms aboard, only on the pier and snacks/drinks for purchase on the enlisted mess decks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saint5
50,Skip the Queen Mary - See This Instead!,"I was really excited to see this attraction. I've been on the USS North Carolina and loved it. Even though this battleship isn't World War II vintage (served in WWII but has been modernized) and is a new attraction, it was fantastic. This beats the Queen Mary hands down and costs less too!The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable and though the areas of the ship that are open to the public as of 2013 are limited, you still get to see a lot. It was a nice contrast to see a modernized battleship after seeing one that had not been. The tour was lengthy, about two hours give or take and there are plans to open up more of the ship in the future.Well worth the money and time spent and with more opening in the future, you can go back and get a whole different experience. Highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danmcmartin
50,Cub Scouts will Love it!,We brought families from our Cub Scout pack on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. It was so interesting to walk all over the ship. The volunteers were so helpful and knowledgeable. Thank you for a great outing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Noel1515
50,Living history,Take the opportunity to walk one of the battle ships that served in WW2. Amazing history. Plan at least 2 hours to see everything. Very worthwhile.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagiant
50,IOWA Tour,Excellent experience. Everyone who loves this country should experience the IOWA. This ship represents the cost of FREEDOM.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/todo751
50,Makes you stop and think!,"We were visiting from Pa and wanted to take a side trip to see this ship. My grandfather, my father's father, served on the USS Iowa during WWII. He was a gunner on the ship. My father and grandfather were extremely close, so this was a must see for my family. There is information at every twist and turn of the boat. From signs depicting what happened to people telling the tales of the men who fought on this great ship, the history was endless. There are benches along the way to allow you to rest from climbing the steep steps or to just sit and take in the ship. There is a gift shop on the ship and you can get a picture taken of your entire group. The gift shop has many reasonably priced items and all of them say USS Iowa! My 10 year old boys got fun o meter buttons for 2.00 that they wore their entire vacation. Everyone was in awe of this magnificent ship and I encourage other people to take time and see this wonder!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmieTink
40,Historical war machine,"This floating museum is impressive in size, capability and historical importance. The venue is staffed by knowledgeable and enthusiastic volunteers and others who do not rush a visitor along and take time to answer questions and offer insight. There are a lot of steep stairs and cramped quarters so if your mobility is impaired be sure to plan accordingly. I would wear sturdy shoes. There are no restrooms on the ship-there are port-a-potties outside. There are a couple of vending machines for soda and water on the ship. Take your time and avail yourself of the knowledge and experience of the staff.It would be nice if the ticketing and general facilites were in a permanent building. It appears as a couple of portable buildings but that doesn't detract from the awesome ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/81jeffreyc
50,Don't miss this one.....!,"What an experience....! The U.S.S. Iowa was one of four super battleships built during WWII. It has only been anchored in Long Beach for about a year and they are still getting their tours organized. But, what a terrific way to take in some unique American history. Lots of parking, friendly and informative staff, reasonable admission.....I can't say enough good things here. There are some stairs and ladders involved so be aware if someone in your group is not very mobile. You can take a guided tour or just amble along on your own. You can spend hours and as of right now only the upper decks are open to tour. Eventually some of the lower decks will be included. This is a great way to spend a day with family or friends. Don't miss this one.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thousehldr
50,Like History? Visit Iowa.,"Iowa, still on ""standby"" for any future national emergencies, is kept in pristine condition by the non-profit foundation that maintains her as a museum ship. Less than a year in her current life, she shines with a fresh coat of Navy Haze Grey paint. She stands tall and proud pier side in San Pedro, hosting the sons and daughters and grandsons and grand daughters of her former crew, ready to show what made her the queen of her class. Currently, you can take a tour, known as ""Tour Alpha"", will take you topsides along her teak and fir main deck, around her massive 16 inch gun turrets, up to parts of the flag bridge, armored conning tower, through some of the other spaces, and back to the old mess decks and ship's store (now a gift shop). Plan on spending a nice day in LA's little know port district of San Pedro, and on and around USS Iowa. Also nearby - a real and nicely restored Victory Ship. San Pedro also has an Art District nearby.Summer Hours: M - S 0900-1600Winter Hours: M - S 1000 - 1600Open 7 Days. Closed Thanksgiving and Christmas. Discounts for veterans and museum members.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SledMan
50,Battleship Iowa.,"Great attraction! While the exhibit is just being settled in, and is not quite as accessible as it will be, don't let that stop you from visiting this historic display! Admission is reasonable, parking is good, and the ship is easy to find! This would make for a good family outting, as there is something for every age on board. View the galley, where the enlisted crew ate their meals, walk the decks, and stand under the huge, 16""guns. The volunteer guides do a great job of sharing their knowledge of the ship's history. Climbing the ship's ladders, viewing the crew quarters, the Presidential Cabin, and ship's store are among the highlights of your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockwrick
50,Respect and awe,"You can't help but gain a deeper respect of the history of the US military when you walk through this floating time capsule. Most of the USS Iowa is completely refurbished but you can still see the effects of time on this floating museum and it's breathtaking. Take a minute to read the signs, climb the steps, take some pictures, look out over the calm ocean and say a quiet ""thank you"" to the people who fought for our freedom.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christineess
50,"Awesome, proud to be American","A must see for everyone. Gave me goosebumps....the history, the people who gave their lives, where its been...just have to see and be on her. A true thrill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/metalchick666
50,Big Ship with a View,"This was a second trip for my wife and myself, and first for her brother and his family which included his 4-year-old daughter, Everyone enjoyed the outing.The museum opened just over a year ago and we noted changes since our first visit last October. As time and money allow, the museum plans to open more sections of the ship. Since the first visit, some of the wooden deck has been covered with plywood, maybe because the desk is rotted in places. Also the route is more defined with ropes so some of the larger areas where last year we wandered, are a bit more controlled, but we still saw everything we could before. I think a few interior areas were new, I don't remember some of the crew quarters from before. One thing I find interesting is the bridge with an Armored Conning Tower, a big cylinder of think steel and small holes to look out. The people controlling the ship were relatively protected but could still see out. Another interesting fact is that the Iowa may be the only Navy ship with a bathtub, installed when President Roosevelt stayed on the ship during WW II.There were docents everywhere to answer questions and along with signs and labels, we learned a lot. This visit we stayed about two hours and felt we spent the right amount of time. Parking is $1.00 / hour which seems reasonable. The ship is along the main channel between the fireboat station and the cruise ship terminal so it includes a view of passing ships and boats, such as the Catalina Express. Last year we watched a container ship being unloaded across the way, but this time it was quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Interesting and great view of the port,"Though the USS Iowa Museum limits visitor to the deck, mess halls, and a few other areas, it is worth the visit. We saw the room where President Roosevelt stayed and the plans for the Omaha Beach invasion were made. In comparison, the USS North Carolina has a more extensive museum area and allows visitors in the bowels of the ship where the engines reside. Also, visitors get first hand accounts from real sailors about their experience on the boat in narratives posted throughout the ship. On the other hand, the Iowa did a good job explaining the missiles and gunnery, but visitors couldn't go inside the turrets.Spend time to watch the action at the Long Beach Port where big container ships come and go before you hit the disney-like museum shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barnetjb123
50,Great attraction!,"A great way to spend a morning solo, with the family or friends. Not every day you get to tour a great battleship from WWII which is very well maintained.Staff is very friendly and helpful. They are happy to answer all your questions even if you take the self guided tour.Try to take the tour with good weather so you can take good pictures on the deck of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TolucaMXM
50,Historic!,"My Family and I saw this beautiful Battleship USS Iowa and it was truly something to remember. Our kids loved it. They were so interested in everything our tour guide was saying. For parents with little ones, watch their every move and take a sweater. It can get pretty chilly. I recommend this to everyone and you will learn the amazing history of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EstherGonzalez
40,USS Iowa,"Interesting self guided tour of the battleship. Lots of history, very interesting and the volunteers are happy to answer questions. Some steep steps. We went when it was first open and I bet there is even more to see now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hikerbear2
20,Expensive and boring,"They opened this attraction in the Los Angeles harbor with great fanfare.... Well they failed. The parking is expensive and unjustifiable. The exhibits are poor, you don't have access to to many area on the ship and the volunteers are not very knowledgeable and unfriendly... Never again",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michelv778
40,Educational tour,The ship has a well laid out self-guided tour with points of interest. We paid extra for a guide for our group of 4. It was well worth it. The docents are retired military and many have served on the Iowa or another battleship so they add personal stories.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargieLA
50,Great for the Guys,"I went with a group of engineers and they had a great time. Even for us ladies, the layout of a real battleship is fascinating. Stairs are steep and can be a bit intimidating, but our group of retirees did ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suz91101
50,Awesome Living History,"Protip: On weekends, make a stop at the nearby San Pedro artist market, CRAFTED, for $10 USS Iowa tickets. Info here: (http://craftedportla.com/uss-iowa-tickets/)This is an awesome ""museum"" and I can't wait to see what the fully fleshed out tours will be like once they are done. As it is, the ""Tour Alpha"" is mainly a self-paced, tour following placards around the guns and decks of the ship. You will be walking up and down steep steps around the ship, so bring comfortable shoes! But what really helped make the ship come alive were the docents stationed at regular intervals around the ship who shared their passion and knowledge. Be sure to ask them questions!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyL7
50,Great 1/2 day trip,Greeted by friendly Volunteers. Enjoy the tour self-guided on a well-maintained ship. Everyone was very interested. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fireantstx
50,USS IOWA,This is a walking tour and can be done in a couple of hours. The service men and women are more than happy to answer any questions. There is a lot to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markp0298
50,USS Iowa Store,"As my wife and I toured the Iowa I was completely overwhelmed with actually being this close to a part of our country's history and amazed at the engineering feat that was accomplished in building such a machine. I felt deep emotion as I read the names of the sailors that gave their lives while serving on the Iowa and as we ended the tour in the gift shop/store, I was looking at the merchandise and saw the t-shirts were made in Haiti, the key chains and souvenirs in Taiwan and other countries. Of all places to have this off-shore junk. Who ever is responsible for making the decission to stock the store of this war memorial with these items should have had second thoughts on what ""Made in the USA"" means. To everyone, this is a must see attracion but avoid the store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/682ronm
40,Better than expected,"My husband is a battleship buff, so I thought we'd take our 6 & 8 year old boys and wander around the ship to please him, then go out to lunch. We ended up spending well over 2 hours, all of us completely fascinated (for different reasons) and loving it! Our boys loved climbing all of the steps, following the arrows on the self guided tour, seeing how many guns they could find on the ship, and watching the simulated battle video at the end. I enjoyed learning about the rich history of the USS Iowa and talking to the very well informed and interesting docents along the way. And of course my husband loved being on such a historical vessel, he was in heaven! We went on a weekday to beat the crowds and I'm glad we did. Make sure you were comfortable, closed toe shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AileenC894
50,It's a battleship!,Wow my husband was so excited to go on this ship! He loved being a part of history! Looking forward to more tours and trips to this shop',https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/789JaneP789
50,"Don't miss ""The Big Stick""!",This gem is being restored to her former glory and volunteers are doing most of the impressive work. So cool to tour this historic vessel!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ValleyMom
40,Highlight of our CA vacation!,"My family with three daughters (12, 10 & 6) loved this! We love history so it was thrilling to find out - and see- that D Day was planned on this ship. We were very fortunate to listen to the volunteers. They were all in the navy. Listening to them really made it come alive. It's important for us and our children to appreciate the sacrifices these men (and now women) made. Being on that ship made history alive. And be sure to visit the great gift shop. it was cheaper for us to become members for admission. With that you get a discount in the gift shop. Wonderful experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mollie129
30,"Nice history, but not that much to see","It was nice to see all 70 years history of this ship, specially its far journey to Persian Gulf with President Roosevelt to join Tehran conference.But not more ... It will be good place to visit with family if you have already visited more attractive attractions in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/halone
50,It's not every day you get to see a battleship...,"...Unless you're in the armed forces, or you happen to work on or near an attraction like the USS Iowa! I highly recommend seeing this ship. According to their pamphlet, it's the only one of it's kind that will be on the west coast. There's a bit of climbing up/down ladders and stairs, and a fair amount of walking to do, but it can all be done at a leisurely pace. Towards the end, there's a small theatre where you can sit and watch a few short films about military ships and the USS Iowa. One of them sums up this experience fairly succinctly saying you don't need to know much about military history or warships to immediately understand the power and presence of a battleship. Truly awe-inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USC_Mare
50,fascinating historical warship,"If you have any interest in historical warships, you absolutely must visit this ship. This is actually the second Iowa-class battleship I have visited, the first being the USS New Jersey in Camden, NJ. One doesn't appreciate how huge and powerful the Iowa-class battleships were until one stands next to the turrets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vacationmanic
50,Father's Day Outing,"The USS Iowa has been in San Pedro for one year and is still undergoing restoration and expansion. It is in amazing condition and is so easy to tour. The docents were soooo informative and eager to share their first hand experiences and tales of war. We were fascinated and learned so much. Our favorite spot was the Captain's quarters where President's Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were hosted as they traveled and visited on the Iowa for various occasions. It was wonderful to see folks of all ages (children and seniors) enjoying this amazing ship and being educated about life in the Navy at war. It is easy to imagine the men running to their stations, the guns being fired and ceremonies taking place. There are many ""ladders"" to climb up and down, wearing comfortable shoes is recommended, but my senior parents were able to manage them easily. My family will definitely return as new exhibits are opened. Tickets can be purchased online for a discounted price. Also, don't forget to take a few minutes to watch the action in the port from the deck-we saw container ships enter and exit the harbor which was an extra treat and really amazing to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebraT851
50,Awesome history in person.,"The USS Iowa is in very good condition (except for the decking, which is being replaced). The self-guided tour was easy to follow. There are docents (guides that stay in a particular area and offer information or answer questions) that are very knowledgeable and most of them served on either the Iowa or one of her sister ships (Iowa is the name of this one and the class of battleships). The price ($18 in summer 2013, discounts for seniors, kids, etc.) was very reasonable. It took me about two hours to do the whole tour. The only downside is that you do not get to see the lower decks where the ammunition and powder magazines are, except for a few places where you can look down through a series of holes in the decks (trunks?).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/COSengineer
40,Great attraction!,"We went here on a whim and really enjoyed it! This battleship has a lot of history and is a great attraction to see if you're new in town or a resident. Right now there are some parts of the ship that you cannot go into because they're still working on it but still worth the price of admission. Seen some star wagons in the parking lot and it looked like some camera equipment was set up onboard, so maybe some filming going on right now. If you're nearby and want to see a real battleship I highlyo recommend going aboard!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubenski777
50,A Great Battleship Experience,"This is not a cruise line, folks! This is a real battleship that is still maintained and could be put back into service at any time.We spent the better part of four hours touring the ship. It is massive and impressive! . Quite the workout climbing up all the ladders leading to the different levels and for that reason would not suggest for small children.There are docents everywhere on this self guided tour that all exuded the enthusiasm of their love of the American military - all were very knowledgeable and excellent at sharing information!There is a room where they show a couple of films that are well worth the time spent to round out your battleship experience.Go spend the day and enjoy !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Off2SeeItAll
50,very interesting great experience,"We toured the vessel today and will certainly return when more parts of it are open. It is very interesting to see a classic ship built for war. There are friendly and helpful docents available to help with the self guided tour. The exhibits are good and surely will improve with time and resource availability. It is fascinating to compare with a visit to the Midway in San Diego, there is significant noticeable difference between this vessel of war and that. Seeing the difference between the heavily armored battle bridge and the VIP cabin was instructive as were the barebones quarters which compared to those on a submarine are luxurious. The size and variety of the armaments is most impressive. It is definitely worth a trip if one has any interest in American military history or just being impressed with the epitome of classic warship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chingachgook
50,the real deal,"Outstanding. truly showed life on a battleship. Got to see how the crew lived and faught. Knowlegable volunteers, rebuilding the ship as the toured.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yev88
50,A Trip Back in History of a Grand Ship,"Toured the USS IOWA last month with a friend. I am a retired Navy Chief Petty Officer, and it was a great treat to be aboard such a grand naval vessel. Since the ship has been open for tours for only a year, there are many areas of the shop not open to view yet. However, more and more areas and tours are planned for opening soon.When we watch the news today of warships and their capabilities, it is interesting to see what ""new technology"" the USS IOWA fielded.Bring your walking shoes...or, more accurately, your ""ladder climbing"" shoes! Lots of up and down ladders (they're not called ""stairs"" on a naval ship) to navigate on the tour.As I was standing near the bridge, I wanted to yell out, ""Aweigh the Sea and Anchor Detail! Make all preparations for getting underway!""Come on down to San Pedro and tour the USS IOWA. Experience history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiefDennis
50,Battleship USS Iowa BB-61,"If you are in the Long Beach/LA area don't miss this marvelous exhibit featuring the Battleship of Presidents. The current tour is very good and the organization is working hard to get more of the ship opened for visitors. There are knowledgeable and friendly docents on board to answer any question and many served aboard the Iowa or other ships in the same era. There is a cafe and shop for refreshments and souvenirs. Presently the only restroom facilities are port-a-potties on the pier. The Iowa is a wonderful educational experience for youngsters - who might otherwise never know about such great ""ships of the line"" that served our nation so well for so long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidA904
50,Living history,"Our family of six adults visited yesterday (June 2, 2013) and we were awed. We got to speak to some of the people who are working on the ship, and they said they have a lot they still want to do, so we will probably continue to visit through the years. Right now it is, as others have noted, a self-guided tour. For anyone who has an appreciation for history and the American military, it is absolutely fascinating, and a privilege to visit this great warship.Note that the tour involves a lot of walking, including climbing up and down ladders. Wear sensible shoes! Also, the only bathrooms are port-a-potties on the dock, so make good use of them before the tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjsmama
50,American History at it's Best,"Visited the USS Iowa in June 2013 with my family (young children) and we all had a wonderful experience.We went on a self guided tour of the ship. The path is clearly marked so there is no chance of getting lost. Plus there are plenty of knowledgeable staff around the ship to answer any question you may have.Although this tour is not arduous, there are many steps/ladders/stairs that you must traverse throughout the tour, plus a few tight places. Be advised the tour is not handicap/wheelchair available. But there is plans to make the tour ADA compliant in the near future.They have a very small snack bar on the tour, and a very well stocked gift shop. Prices are a little high, but not too back. Nice selection of gifts and souvenirs.They also take a couple of pictures when you first board the ship and you can see them near the gift shop. They cost two for $20, and we thought it was worth the money, they came out very nice.Parking was plentiful next to the ship, and cost $1 per hour.Plan on spending about 2 hours on the ship/tour.Although the tour is sort of basic right now, they plan on expending to more areas of the ship in the years to come.I would highly recommend this to my family and friends. And I look forward to returning next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SNAFU23
40,If you appreciate history and understand what you are seeing... it is awesome!,"We visited the USS Iowa yesterday. It was a warm day and there were many excited visitors to tour the ship. In fairness to my wife... she was not impressed, thought the lines were too long, and was generally not satisfied. Ok... my turn. There are good directions and plenty of street signs to get you to the dock. After you get your ticket... your first stop is a photo booth that will take pics of you in front of a green screen that you can review in the gift shop. They came out good and for $20 we got two pics in covers that came out very good and are memories to save. On to the tour, it is self-guided and there were plenty of volunteers and JROTC(?) Navy Cadets to answer questions and help you along the way. Unlike the Midway (aircraft carrier) in San Diego... there is only one way to go and the passages are narrow... the line will proceed slowly as there is plenty to see. The ship is in excellent condition for a keel laid 70 years ago. By Navy standards to be decommissioned in the mid 90's... this ship had many upgrades that made it a key member of the Navy until she was retired. The ship is in excellent condition and does not appear as dated as the Midway. By agreement.... the ship is required to be maintained in some degree of readiness. The tour takes you through many levels from the gun deck, through the galley, and to the bridge. There are many signs along the way that explain many details of the ship. The Captain's quarters were very interesting to think that FDR had traveled to Europe on this ship during WWII to discuss various aspects of the D-DAY invasion and other matters with our Allies. A very different world from today where our President can now jump on Air Force One and be anywhere by tomorrow morning. Each of the Iowa Class ships has a unique place in history. Thankfully, they are being preserved and displayed. Anyway, this is a fantastic tour of an extinct class of battleship. KEY POINTS: by necessity... this ship will not accommodate persons with disabilities (I say maybe any young kids under 6) that prevent them from climbing ladders and the raised narrow thresholds between rooms and entries... to Paula B... Its a shame they could not make allowance for an actual veteran of the ship to wheel him up the entry ramp and at least see the views from the main deck. Anyway, the ship has only been on display since July of 2012. The group overseeing this effort are still sorting through many details. There are many plans to provide expanded and special tour packages to various parts of the ship. As stated, this ship has not been out of service that long and you will not be disappointed with the condition of the ship and the refinements in upgrades made over the course of her service. Our 12 year old loved it! If you have kids, history buffs, or folks that need a tangible reminder of the military service, this is a well spent couple of hours... I am sure I will be going back and recommending this attraction to visitors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JLSThousandOaks_CA
50,An Alpha Tour of Battleship Proportions,"An awesome battleship with an awesome history ... The ""Tour Alpha"" on offer is a self-guided tour, where you can follow the yellow track footprints at your own pace of physical fitness and viewing absorption.And there's a heck of a lot to take in with a ship of this gynormous size and ferocious history ... Highlights are, of course, the fierce cannons and bristling harpoons dominating the ship's long decks; the Cruise and Tomahawk missiles on show; the elegant war planning room alongside of which is FDR's own quarters and bed; and the various ranking officers' staterooms.Casual wear, flat rubber soled shoes or strapped sandals, and sunscreen plus shades (and a hat if possible) are de rigeur for this tour.The ocean view of L.A. Harbor from the ship's Berth 87 with giant loading gantries in the piers across the way is impressive... so is the fortuitous passing of a humongous cargo container ship which can actually dwarf the battleship!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rajamora
10,88 1/2 Yr Old WWII Vet Refused Admittance To His Own Ship.,"My dad was so thrilled when we drove to San Pedro to board the ship he had served on during WW II. On the drive he told stories about working in the boiler room, the day he saw FDR on board,and his buddies. When we arrived we were told he wouldn't be allowed on board because wheelchairs weren't allowed on. We offered to sign a waiver removing any liability. Still no admittance was granted. After much pleading my dad was told to come back in about 2yrs when"" it should be handicap accessible."" My dad is now 89 1/2 . The ship he served and risked his life on is still not equipped to let him aboard. I'm wondering how much more time the folks who run the USS IOWA think dad has left. He can't be the only WWII vet who has been refused admittance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulaB961
40,Something to remember,"My family went to the retired ship on Memorial Day this year and yes it was busy. However, this was our second trip, as we bought the year pass last year when we went. Which wasn't too bad. So, I was glad for one to use the passes again. And two, we were able to take our veteran friend from the Air Force to see it also. He really enjoyed it. We did too. It is right across from some of the loading berths in long beach. Those are a sight to see also. The tours on the U.S.S Iowa are self guided, though there are guides standing throughout the ship giving you bits of information. You can stand & listen as much our as little as you want. Which is nice. The only bad part is being stuck behind the people who want to stand and listen to it ALL. So, you kind of have to navigate around these people if you want to listen a little and just look and read about it all. Overall, it is a good experience for the family. With a gift shop and video to watch down inside, it's a nice trip to make.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amyt234
50,Impressive battleship,"This wasn't the first battleship to visit , I visited the one near Houston last year , This one is really impressive and huge one , Liked the self-guided paths.Got the package ticket with Queen mary and the submarine , best attractions in long beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MahmoudSalem
40,Battleship Worth Remembering,"Despite the massive throng of visitors on Memorial Day, this first-time excursion aboard a famousbattleship was a thrill. Taking in the sheer mass and breadth of the vessel, learning its history and simply viewing what most people never see relating to life aboard ship for our courageous service men and women is something every patriotic American should see first hand. Watching the excellent movie shorts at the end of the tour brings the marvel of American heroism and technological supremecy to a great climax. Try to visit on a non-crowded day or be prepared for slow moving lines by having eaten before hand, bringing drinks and using the facilities too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Belizebuds
30,Want to see more of the Ship,"This is a great opportunity to be on a ship with so much History. I just wished that more areas of the ship – such as the sailor’s living quarters, engine room, etc. - were open.Plan to arrive at the museum when it first opens that way the ship is less crowded and you can enjoy the tour better. This is a self-guided tour with docents located throughout the ship who can provide you with great historical facts about the ship. Unfortunately there are some areas of the ship where the walkway is narrow so delays can occur.There are no restrooms inside the ship so use it before you go in. A bank of portable restrooms is located towards the back of the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FGTraveler
50,A must for history buffs,"While they don't have all the tours available yet, the basic Tour Alpha that can be taken now is most informative. You ill see the wardroom and officer cabins, signal and flag bridge, armored conning tower and other things on seven different levels of the huge ship. Be advised that you have to used the same narrow and steep stairs used by the seamen so it's not for people with serious mobility issues, but my husband, who walks with a cane was able to complete the entire tour by being really careful. If you're from Iowa, show your driver's license and you're in for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeD916
40,Relive History,"Everyone enjoyed this tour, while the tour was a little too much walking for my mother-in-law (86); she still thoroughly enjoyed the tour and the history. Four presidents! The only battleship with a bathtub! Amazing tour - amazing history. Don't miss this one on your trip to Southern California!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeriG270
40,Definitely Impressive!,"This is definitely worthwhile and for an exhibit open only since 2012, it is well-done. I would hope in the future they'd do some things like the Intrepid in NYC to augment the exhibit - either on board where one could actually get inside a turret and look at the breech or through the barrel or add displays inside the various spaces so one could look more closely at bofers, R2 D2's, pictures of groups of the crew or the engine room. Could used an audio headset system for those interested in a self-guided tour with more info than what is on the various placards. Could use a building in the parking lot to add other material, documents, information, pictures as well as a place to sit down and relax - even a picnic area or some vendors. Fairly spartan right now but just the ship itself is reason enough right now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tag1990
50,Excellent for young and old,Took my 5yo armed forces mad son to this ship while visiting from Australia. He loved it. It was an easy walk around although not for anyone in a wheelchair or not able to climb steep stairs. Overall I would thoroughly recommend the trip to this ship for anyone wanting to see a part of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissMinelli
50,Great piece of US Naval history!,I had a great time. The ship is very impressive. I'm looking forward to more of the ship opening to have another reason to go back!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoshuaS515

50,Living History Lesson,"I loved the tour of the USS Iowa. This is a great historical ship. I especially want to complement the men and women staffing the ship. The guides are knowledgeable, friendly and really amusing. Be warned though, this tour may not be suitable for small children or elderly visitors. The stairways on a battleship are steep. Although well maintained, hazards exist.Some food and drink is available, but restrooms are located on the dock.Views of the harbor and San Pedro from the ship are wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/711KC
50,Bringing out the child in all of us!,"When I was a child, my favorite toy was a Battleship. From the moment that I stepped aboard the U.S.S. Iowa, I felt as though I had somehow been miniaturized and placed onto that ship. Only this was no toy. This was the real deal. A piece of history that served during WW II, The Korean War and finally after being upgraded with missile launchers, and other high tech devices, it cruised the seas during The Cold War. For my $18.00 admission, I was essentially set free to roam on a self guided tour taking as much time as I cared to in each area that was open for public viewing. Several guides were stationed along the way and were very open to any questions that I had. The exhibit is not yet accessible for the disabled and you have to be able to climb up and down ladders to the various decks. There is a gift shop and various opportunities for refreshments to be had along the way as well.Only those who journeyed on this great vessel can know what it felt like to do so. Likewise, it is one thing to have seen her 16 inch guns and another thing to have heard them. I am very proud and grateful to be an American and even more proud of those who serve our country, in the past, the present and in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DocJ52
40,Authentic Battleship,"My husband is a history buff, so we went last weekend to tour the battleship. But I found it very interesting too even tho history is not my thing. They have knowledgeable guides stationed around the ship that can answer your questions and share interesting facts about the ship's history and its tours. They could probably use a few more descriptive signs along the way to explain things. See if you can find the typo on one sign. The guide told me only about one person a week points it out. Not all of the ship is open yet, but there are plans to open up more of the ship and have more tours of the different areas on board, so check the website to see when that will happen. Please note it is colder on the deck and much of the open ship is outside, so quite chilly compared to the inland temperatures. It took us about one hour to see the whole ship. There is no public restroom on the ship, but there are port a potties outside before you board. Also lots of ladder like steep stairs up and down, so not for the un-agile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MySeaBiscuit13
50,Great!,Very nice self-guided tour through the ship. Staff on board was very knowledgable and were able to answer questions about the ship. Arrows marked a path for our tour. The only problem was finding our way off the ship from the gift shop! Thought the entrance fee was high.The photo taken in front of a green screen was fun...big blast they added behind us made the outcome surprising and fun!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Turpy23
40,Historical ship,"At last, San Pedro gets a classic WWII battleship for its own, so it is a no brainer to visit. While this is nowhere near the attraction that Navy Week was back in 2011 (Loved seeing the aircraft carrier Lincoln), you will not have to wait all day to see it. However, the regular admission fee does seem steep. Fortunately, I was able to find a Groupon offer, so the price I paid was definitely worth the admission (For the out of town folks, hope you figure that out before you get there). Definitely, a lot of history and stories to be told, though not all parts of the ship were accessible really because after all, it is a ship first and foremost and wasn't designed to be tourist-friendly. Hopefully, as the years past, more of it will be open and hopefully, the Navy will never have a reason to recall it back to duty.While I was there, most of the folks visiting seemed elderly, but then most of the folks who served aboard this vessel are of that age, so it is good memories for them when they served our country. Also, make sure you use the restrooms first before you board!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/got-rice
50,Loved it!,"My retired father wanted to see a battleship and I found this on a random search. Just driving up I found myself in awe, but walking all over & through it was incredible. We paid a fee to do a self-guided style tour. There were arrows marking out a clear path to follow and signage posted with info throughout the ship. We found volunteers posted here and there that we were able to answer our questions as well. There are lots of ladders and doorway obstructions so be prepared when you visit. Everywhere we went was camera-friendly. They also offer special tours of other areas of the ship but we didn't go on any of them, though we wish we had the time to do so. This is an awesome piece of living history that everyone would enjoy as long as they are able-bodied enough to get around. Bringing a small child would be difficult, might be best for 6yrs and up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chi-TownTJ
50,Great floating museum,"We toured the battleship USS Iowa this week. It was a self-guided tour & we were able to see almost all of the ship (no engine room or ordnance area). There were placards explaining things & loads of docents/volunteers everywhere to answer questions about the ship & its history. We had no idea that FDR and others planned the invasion of Europe on the ship! Interesting to see his stateroom & the bathtub they installed just for him. The museum area had really good story boards and an animated film. The ship's store was a well stocked with every imaginable item you might want as a souvenir. We had Groupon tickets for half-price, parking is $1 an hour & there is a huge parking lot. It is close to Ports O'Call if you are having trouble locating it. You must be able to walk up & down steep metal stairs, although there were some older people just sitting on the first deck. Sneakers are best. Be advised to use the portable toilets before going on the tour as there are none on the ship. All in all, a great attraction that is full of history. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheilakeel

40,"Yes, it is the real deal...a Battleship!","Three of us went to see this great, huge, historical ship. Wow! I bought my tix online, saved two dollars. Website says parking is $1.00, but it is really a dollar per hour. It was a Thursday, absolutely no crowd, plenty of parking. There is no wheelchair access on the ship (yet), and those that cannot go up and down steep, narrow ladders will be quite limited. I understand things will improve somewhat on these items, as time goes by...after all, it is a relatively new museum. The only food is snacks and soda in a gift shop, and the only restrooms are outhouses near the parking lot. If this all sounds bad, well, it really is not. This is, afterall, a big, armored, Navy ship, and was not built for comfort. That is the beauty...it is ALL combat tuned...this is as good as it gets. I would rate it excellent all day, but had to drop a notch since it is not easy for everyone to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DantheMountainMan
50,"We had a great docent, Mr. Barron","It is easy to find the USS IOWA. New directional signs have been put up on the freeway and on the offramp. Parking is $1 per hour. The tour was supposed to be 60 - 90 minutes. But we were a large group and asked many questions. Mr. Barron had many stories. I'm sure we didn't get to hear them all. Our tour was 120 minutes. Everyone in our group raved about the tour and our guide. We applauded him! There are ten stairs to climb. They are like ladders. It is easier to go down them backwards, like on a ladder. A couple of people dropped out because of the stairs. The tour is all above the main deck. We did not go down into the bowels of the ship. There are three films to watch, total time 10 minutes. The gift shop has everything you could think of. I was impressed. And I resisted. Try to get Mr. Barron.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CASanMarino
50,"The USS Iowa, a wonderful experience.","As we parked, we were impressed by the sheer size of the ship. What a wonderful piece of American history! She was built for WWII and brought back for several wars and confrontations, being upgraded each time. There is a self-guided tour. Someone set it up well by making it one-way with all the ladder steps. There were docents in various areas who gave great insight into that particular part of the ship. They were very knowledgable and friendly. If there wasn't a docent available, there were posters gving information about each area. I enjoyed President Roosevelt's stateroom and bathtub. The Iowa is the only battleship with a bathtub. There is a lot of walking and steps, but it is well worth spending at least two hours to see. The museum is a must see as is the movie. There is a great gift shop and a place to get food. A sign said there are plans for future tours. I hope I can return and take some of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manatee27
50,The USS Iowa,"What a wonderful trip back into history. This is a self directed tour with docents at various area to give the history, use, and to answer questions. This is not a tour for the handicapped. There is a lot of walking and ladder steps from one level to another. It is a battleship with posters of information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandraW252

50,A Great Piece of American History - MUST SEE!,"I didn't know much about battleships but by the time we left I knew a lot! It's still a work in progress but what they have now is excellent. We've visited several historical vessels and this one is the best as far as providing interesting facts and history.You can choose either the guided tour or the self-tour; we chose the latter. You can spend as much time as you want in any area and there are docents to provide information.The most interesting thing we learned about the USS Iowa is that it can still be called into service. It has been deactivated three times already and called back into service for the Korean War and Operation Desert Storm.They also went out of their way in the gift shop to mark the many souvenirs made in the USA! There's also a snack bar with coffee, sandwiches and salads.It's got some serious climbing between decks so not good if you can't climb ladders or very young children. Wear sturdy shoes and don't bring a lot to carry. There are no restrooms on the ship so be sure to use the ones available on the pier before you go aboard.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Malcolmsmom
50,Grand Old Battleship,"The Mrs.and I were in San Pedro/Wilmington over the weekend and had the opportunity to visit the USS Iowa (now a museum). We were the last to board for the day and had our own tour guide as he locked up behind us. What an excellent visit to this magnificent ship. We were deeply touched by its history, the men who served on board and what it took to build her. IF you are anywhere near the LA Harbor, you must visit this grand warrior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danny_B918
50,Loved it!,"We found this tour very interesting. I would highly recommend that you take advantage of seeing this piece of history. Even though it as only been open since July 2012, I thought you got to see a lot and the tour will only get better as they continue the expansion.I really enjoyed the retired military personnel that were on the ship to answer questions, provide tour info, etc. I enjoyed the captain's quarters the most and the modifications made for President Roosevelt's stay on the ship.Don't forget that you get to tour free if you have an Iowa drivers license.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HawkItraveler
30,Uss Iowa,"The ship itself was very interesting . but they don't have anything open below decks yet . You are forced to follow little arrows between roped pathways , and if you are behind slower people you can get stuck ...I would wait until they get more decks open for viewing and maybe then it will be a better value and more fun .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pizzalover270
50,What an eye-opener! Surprisingly good.,"I'm not a huge military history buff, but I found this tour fascinating. The enthusiasm and breadth of knowledge of the docents was excellent. My husband and I went, just to do something different, and it was so worthwhile.We timed our visit for 4 PM because that's the cut off for the last entry before the 5 PM closing time, and that was good and bad. Good because we got a personalized tour by one of the top staff members (he needed to sweep the ship to be sure it was clear before closing, so he swept us along with great stories all along the way). The not-quite-ideal part was that an hour was not really enough time to see the entire ship (at least with all that extra info in the form of stories!), so we were a little rushed at the end, and could've used more time in the store and museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrDCpr
50,Historic preservation at its best.,"Exploring the Iowa is a dream for history buffs, families and anyone that love ships. I was happy that it is in such great shape, exept for the teak deck which badly needs replacing. Great gift shop, exhibits and places to sit and think. See it.Hint: combine this with the Long Beach Aquarium and get a fantastic discount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GenotheViking
40,Celebrate The American Sprit at San Pedro Harbor,"USS Iowa is a Battleship museum. You can enjoy American war time history aboard the only West Coast Battleship open to the public.Points of interest include a journey through WW II, Cold War, and Korean War. The ship is fun for the whole family both old and young. Children and adults will enjoy a fun educational experience. For military buffs this is a must see attraction in Southern California.I felt as though I had taken a step back in time. To see the ship yourself is a real treat.While in San Pedro you may be interested in the near by Maritime Museum a short walk from the famous Battleship USS Iowa.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cynthia-LAX
50,A walk through history,"If you like history, and especially if you like Military History, you will really enjoy this. The hours of operation indicated that it closed at 4 PM. We arrived about 3:45 PM and asked if we were too late. They told us that the ticket office closes at 4 PM but the ship is open until 5 PM. We were in luck. They had a senior citizen rate which we took advantage of. The tour of the ship is very similar to the tour of the USS Missouri in Pearl Harbor. The tour is laid out with ropes and arrows showing the way. There were people available along the way to explain what you were looking at. It took us about an hour to complete the tour. Definitely a nice way to spend an hour!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1aCruise4wks
50,Great history and engineering,Had a half day to kill and this filled the bill perfectly. The guides dotted around the ship were very friendly and well informed. The engineering was fantastic and almost larger than life. This is a great piece of American military history and I am very glad it is being preserved. Definitely recommended!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheOldSilverFox
30,Good day tour to take,"We went this past weekend and did the USS Iowa tour. Being it just came to dock last year they are working on expanding their tour of the ship. It is a self guided tour which takes approximately 2 hours to walk thru at a nice pace. Very very steep stairwells to climb. Definitely wear closed toe flat shoes to navigate the stairs. They are working on making it handicap accessible. There are docents all along the various areas to explain the different aspects of the ship. No restrooms on the ship but plenty outside before boarding. There is a very nice gift shop within the ship. Overall, nice tour to take.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
40,battleship AND SS LANE VICTORY,"there are two ships on s harbor and the iowa is the restored hero of the obvious day , that is until you hear of the presence of the ss lane victory, a armed transport ship two miles down road and equally, if not more, deserving of your time and energy and appreciation. she is at the end of a nice road that follows the pierline , ends at a dirt lot and appears in much the same shape as the big stick before the folks in norcal put her back together. this is as much an important example of a fighting navy of world war two to the nineties, and now sits nearly forgotten.however,she is a gem to those who go aboard and listen to her history, read her plaques and visits the below deck musuem, where the working engine used in the sand pipers with steve mcqueen. i would for you to see her while you are on the same road, take as much time and ask the iowa museum to pay attention to her and include her, refit and restore her with the same love and care as the big stick. realize these are war ships and you have to go up and down stairs, so this isnt a disabled ship tour per se. its good for anyone who wants to see the navy and history, and feel the love of a navy that is rapidly disappearing. dont miss the lane victory!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimSanJoseCalifornia
40,Very Interesting,"If you are interested in seeing a battleship this is a good one to see. The tour is not as thorough as we'd hoped for, but the work they have done is amazing. More for men than women (my husband and father loved it), it was still interesting for our whole group. The tour only takes about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeckyC226
40,One of the last great battleships,"See the ship that put into service in 1940 and retired around 1990 and the ship many of Americas presidents stood upon both in good times and the not so good times. Still new to tourists it has a simple self-guided tour with many volunteers some who had served upon her to answer any questions and inform you about the history and pride of this ship. She still has secrets within her which are being uncovered even today. Must see the war room map recently restored and the secrets uncovered under the paint.Learn about the battles she fought, and the infamous explosion that took some 40 souls. See how life was aboard her and how it was modified so FDR could board her.It is a piece of American history and it is well worth the price of admission to save this piece of history.You must be fairly agile and able to climb up and down some steep steps as well as navigate some tight quarters as this is a real ship...the way it sailed when it was in service defending our freedom...To really see it set aside a couple of hours and be sure to visit the gift shop at the end where you can find many books and other materials relating to it's days in service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryG668
50,Day trip on a battleship,"This was the first battleship I had ever been on. Its huge. They say this battle ship is even longer than the Titanic. It was easy to park ($1 an hour) and then get tickets (no line) and walk to board the ramp to the ship. One aboard you can follow the yellow arrows and placards around the ship to get more information about the history, dimensions and details of the ship. There are also volunteers at several spots throughout the ship that can answer questions and give you more details.*Must see if in San Pedro",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sigirl33
30,It has potential.,"I have toured the USS Alabama, USS North Carolina, USS Wisconsin and the USS Massachusetts. Those are very well established tourist attractions. The USS Iowa has only been in town LA a few months. So the tours are still being worked out. I am sure that over time it will get better and better. Right now the tour is a bit bare bones but still interesting. The self guided tour takes 90 minutes if you stop to read every sign. So I am sure it will get better. Actually I know it will get better because the volunteers are so dedicated. If you have a question they will be sure to answer it ten fold.Unfortunately the ship is berthed next across from the country's biggest container port. Today's container ships make the ship look small. I hope it can be moved to better location that can highlight its size.If your interested I would rate the USS Alabama or the USS North Carolina as the top BB tours in the country. Why the USS Iowa is in LA, I am not sure however now that it is tinsel town will work it self up to the top!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldensign
50,USS Iowa Battleship,"This is a self-guided tour, but the docents were plentiful and extremely knowledgeable!!! What a FANTASTIC time my Dad and I had touring this Ship. Like any other battleship or aircraft carrier, this is not an ADA-friendly location -- many steps and ladders; no elevators or escalators. Very worthwhile to see - if you can make the effort. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scintoshelly
50,AWESOME!,"As you drive up the road to get to the battleship it overwhelms you. It is so big and beautiful in all of its glory. I had a Groupon for this attraction and I'm so glad I did otherwise I might have missed this opportunity. The docents on the boat are really kind and knowledgeable without being patronizing or bored. They really want to share their stories with you and the information about whichever part of the ship they are on. It took us about 2 hours to walk around the whole thing--all is marked on the self guided tour. Be careful though...it is a lot of walking and they have 12 ladders for you to either climb up or climb down and some of them are quite steep. They have a huge giftshop and a really nice short movie to watch towards the end of the tour. You can't take enough pictures, so don't forget your camera!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hbgirl-forever
50,Great ship but the volunteers make the difference,"A visit to this ship has been on our list since July. We finally visited last week and the experience exceeded our expectations.The ship is still being restored after being mothballed. Alot of work has been completed. My wife and I hardly qualify as military buffs but found the visit extremely interesting and worthwhile. The ship has alot of history. What really makes the difference is the docents on board. In each section these volunteers brought the ship to life. Make sure you stay put and listen to them. They have truly fascinating snippets of information.It takes about 2 hours to do justice to the ship. Do not miss the museum. One word of warning. If you have difficulty with ladders, you will have a problem. We had no issues but there were quite a few people who clearly had not been out of a chair for a long time.I highly recommend this attraction and will go back in a year when some of their specialized tours become available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ianbeavis
50,Impressive,"We had the opportunity to visit the USS IOWA on December 27th. It was Outstanding! As we bordered we felt that we were stepping back into our History. It is hard to put into words the Pride we felt and the Gratitude we have for all who served on this Ship for over 50 years. We would like to salute the Volunteer's, they were Outstanding! The Ship is being restored and I'm sure will be even more impressive in the future. Please consider investing your time and visit the USS IOWA, i know that you will find that it was time well spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Parrothead1829-2

40,Great piece of history.... but it will be better in a few years,Because it just opened as a museum it has a long way to go.The boat is great as it is so it is worth the visit for any Navy buff.The is in really bad shape so it will be nice once it is redone.The interior is nice and as they open up more areas for tours it will get better.I will most certainly be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arizonaac
50,A MUST SEE,"This ship has such a rich history. Capt. Kent and the other members of the crew are doing an amazing job. If you are anywhere near San Pedro, you should make a special effort to visit the ""Big Stick"". I can tell you that the Sailors and Marines who served aboard the Iowa have much to be proud of. Many of them are the volunteers that are restoring this great ship. I was there for the Grand Opening and since then, I've made several more visits. More and more areas of the ship are being opened each month. I am proud to say that I am an original member of the CPO Mess as well as a ""Plankowner."" I also own several ""Deck Plugs"" (see picture). Don't forget to stop by the Iowa's Gift Shop, it is one of the best I've I seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,SIMPLY AMAZING,My family and I got to be one of many to explore this amazing battleship. From the moment you step foot onto the ship you feel apart of something so special. Words can not describe the feeling. You just have to experience for yourself and you will know exactly what I mean. Plus everyone on the ship is so kind and helpful. One of the best experiences and tours I have ever had. Something I will get to share with my kids and grandkids someday. Thank you to all the men who served on the ship and to those who continue to serve our country.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debbiem173
40,Sentimental Journey with my father,"I was at the USS Iowa on July4, 2012 when it was commissioned as a museum in San Pedro. The ship is old, and was not completely ready to be opened. many of the WWII vets who were there were not allowed aboard in their wheelchairs, because even the main deck was not up to ADA specifications. The very sailors who sailed on ""The Big Stick"" were refused!Nevrtheless, having heard stories my whole life about the ship, it was surreal for me to walk the deck. I stood and looked at the location of the starboard stern-most quad-40 AA mount where my dad had been the gunner's mate. We were allowed below to just the first deck down, into the mess. I was overwhelmed at the lack of ventilation, the smell of deisel fuel, and the lack of natural sunlight. 20 minutes was enough for me, and I realized my dad was aboard for 3 1/2 years. He wasn't able to just stroll the upper deck at his leizure as I was.The tour is probably of only mild-moderate interest to anyone without a Navy connection of a family member who served on board, but for those, I recommend it highly. Hopefully the main deck, at least, will be made accessible to those who deserve most to visit the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/empac99
50,Impressive!,"Once I heard that anyone with a valid Iowa drivers license gets in free, I was all over this. It was a self-guided tour with volunteers along the way to answer questions and give more details about specific areas of the ship. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours and is informative and interesting, though it is not wheelchair accessible--a lot of climbing the steep stairs to get to the next level and back.Great to view if you happen to be in the area and have a few hours to kill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/staceyss
50,"Our Liberties We Prize, Our Rights We Will Maitain","The title of this review is the motto of the USS Iowa. Coincidently, it is also the motto of the state of Iowa.I visited the USS Iowa, AKA: The Big Stick, with two friends and we were totally impressed by its mammoth size at 887’-3’ in length. It is a must see for any WW II history buff. The tour and refurbishment is a work in progress as they continue to make more of the ship open to the public. The Iowa spent many years in mothballs in the bay area, and has been in the Port of Los Angeles just since July.It is a self-guided tour, with numerous docents at key areas to explain the particular site. The captain’s quarters on the tour as is the wheelhouse. The turrets of the 16” guns are not available for touring yet. The guns themselves are impressive and you can only imagine how powerful they were in battle hurling Volkswagen size shells up to 24 miles away with pinpoint accuracy.Cost is $18 or $15 for seniors for the self-guided tour that lasts about two hours. There is a some climbing up and down steep stairs covering three decks, so it is not for the disabled. The tour starts with a photo op and ends in a small museum and gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyranno
50,Best attraction in San Pedro,visiting the USS IOWA was an exciting and emotional experience. To be on a battleship that fought for our country so many times and still looks powerful is amazing. Touring the ship kept my interest the whole time. I am looking forward to my next visit. If you have a friend or relative who fought in WWll please try to bring him/her along. Visiting this magnificent battleship will not disappoint you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickyP611
50,RE: USS IOWA FUTURE PLANS,"Turret 2, will probably never open to the public. The interior of the turret is filled with memorial items, wreaths, photos and plaques dedicated to the souls of the 47 sailors that died in her on April 19,1989. It is expected that Turrets 1 & 3 will open relatively soon. Some of the 5"" guns have been cleaned and are almost ready to open. When the ship gets water and power, it will make the cleanup of asbestos & PCBs go a lilttle faster, but these things take time and not much below decks will open until such time as all the hazardous materials are either encapsulated or removed. As far as the upper decks go, the ladders between the decks are narrower than that are on the lower decks. In addition, the ceilings are lower, the knee-knockers higher and travel between them would really slow down the tour process.Planned to open relatively soon are the crew's quarters, some of the officer's quarters, the machine shop, engine room, dental & medical areas, and brig.There are requirements placed on the ship by the US Navy that no structural modifications be made at this time. The ship is subject to recall by the Navy in the event of an emergency and has to be made sea worthy in 90-120 days from recall.At the present time there are no restroom facilities, or running water. The ship is not ADA compliant so wheelchairs and strollers are not permitted on board. All children must be able to walk and climb stairs on their own. Carrying children in a back pack or front carry will result in all sorts of head injuries as the passageways up and down ladders are relatively narrow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sal_Nesrevi
50,Big Boat,"The keel of the USS Iowa was laid before the US entered World War II but it was launched and commissioned in time to participate in several major engagements of that war. After WW II it was mothballed only to be reactivated for the Korean War, mothballed and reactivated for the Viet Nam War, mothballed again and reactivated a final time for the Gulf War, and mothballed one last time. In mid 2012 it traveled to Los Angles Harbor for use as a floating museum. The Iowa was the first in the Iowa Class of Battleship, the only class designed after, the Montana Class, was never built. By the end of WW II, the aircraft carrier became the centerpiece of navel fleets and two aircraft carriers can be toured in California, the Midway in San Diego and Hornet in Alameda, but the Iowa is the largest Navel vessel in Los Angeles.Since the use of the ship as a museum is only a few months along, the self-guided tour, which takes about an hour or two, is mostly above decks. Interior parts of the tour are mostly the bridge and galley/mess (where the gift shop is located. The museum plans to open additional parts of the ship over the next few years. We bought a membership and hope to return in about a year to see what new has been added. The above decks part of the tour includes the three turrets with three 15 inch guns each, which could fire a 2,700 pound shell 26 miles and be heard over 30 miles away. Other weapons include smaller guns and several guided missile launchers, but the once hundreds of anti-aircraft guns are gone now.From the deck we also could watch a container ship across the channel being unloaded, other ships, the Vincent Thomas Bridge, and the cruise ship terminal. Within a short distance of the USS Iowa are the fireboat station, LA Maritime Museum, Ports of Call Village, Fort MacArthur, light houses, Cabrillo Marine Aquarium, and many other points of interest. The USS Iowa can easily be the starting point of a full day of history. A large parking lot charges $1.00 per hour. So far, the tour is not ADA ready.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

They are still in the process as of this review (10/15/2012) of outfitting the ship as a museum but it still is worth the visit. The huge guns are breathtaking and it's wild to think that they could hit a target as far away as Catalina Island from it's berth in the port of LA!!It was interesting seeing the bath tub they installed for FDR's trip across the atlantic. It was just the right size to be fun but not overwhelimng. I would highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tconk40554

Stupid San Francisco politicians, Senator Fienstien worked very hard to get us a chance to dock this Great WW II ship in San Francisco. Can't they see that what a great Revenue boost this would have been? I guess not. If you get a chance, head down to Ling Beach and visit this floating Memorial. Oh, and it's the only Ship in the Navy ever to have a bathtub. This was President Roosevelt's personal transport during WW II. I hope the Verterans that were in Richmond show up in Long Beach with the wonderful stories they told. I hope someone is documenting these stories so they are not lost.

50,Visiting History,"We visited the USS Iowa which is now at her permanent berth in San Pedro, California for a Sunday break.She is NOT in Richmond Ca, any longer.Being interested in history and the mechanics of such a monumental structure I was truly impressed.My wife is more interested in the living spaces of the people who crewed the ship and was pleased to see the ward rooms and mess halls.The kitchen area looked like it could feed the 5,000!The ship is in the early stages of transformation into a floating museum, but, I think that it is important to see her in this almost original condition.There is an ample parking lot which costs only $1 per hour so that factor won't break the bank.The on board visit is $18 if you happen to be lucky enough to be under 61, or $15 if you are on the other side of 61.The tour includes steep stairs both up and down and is quite a walk.There are restrooms on the quay but none on board.Be prepared for the scale of this behemoth aptly nicknamed ""The Big Stick"".She has transported three presidents, FDR, Ronald Reagan and George W. H. Bush.The presidental quarters on board were not palatial but boy did they have great security.To me the most memorable moment was seeing a man who had served on board standing at attention saluting the flag with his family including grandkids looking proudly on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Biker-Norm
50,A Must See,"This is the opportunity to see the largest and most powerful ship built by the US during WWII. It packs the largest rifled guns ever used by the US military. Everthing on this ship is enormous!I enjoyed the experience of being on one of the last of the big-gun battleships so much that I became a volunteer myself! For those who know the importance of the Iowa class battleships and the role they played in our history, you also understand the great honor it is for Los Angeles to be the home of such a historically significant and unique ship.Although I don't officially represent the ship, being a volunteer, I have a bit more knowledge about the the day to day operation of the ship. First, almost everyone you see working on the ship is a volunteer. Everyone from the ticket takers and the security staff at the entrance, to the tour guides and maintenance people on the ship, are volunteers. All that refurbishment work being done on the ship as almost all done by volunteers. Literally there are hundreds of volunteer man-hours being spent on the ship everyday. The $18 admission you pay to get on the ship pretty much covers the lease on the berth (the City of LA does not donate that space), the electricity on the ship, the minimal paid staff on the ship, and the cost of supplies and equipment used to refurbish the ship. Remember, it spent 20 years in the mothball fleet, being beaten up by the weather and salt air, with no upkeep. No one is getting rich off of the Iowa being here in LA (well maybe the Harbor Dept). For those who cringe at the thought of an $18 admission charge, take into consideration that the money is going toward making the USS Iowa museum a success here in Los Angeles and not lining somebodies pockets. The money is also going toward making other parts of the ship accessible to the public. Also, think about the last time you didn't think twice about spending $10 for a beer at the ball game, or $5 for a cup of fancy coffee.Because of the use of volunteer tour guides, some days there's more than others. When you come across one, ask questions, LOTS of questions. That's what they're there for and they love to share their knowledge about the ship. It would also help if you read up a bit on the USS Iowa and the Iowa-class battleships here on the internet before going. It's always more fun if you already have a bit of knowledge about what you're going to see prior to seeing it. On Wikipedia if you research ""Iowa class battleship,"" you'll learn more than you ever wanted to know about the significance and capabilities of these ships. If you research ""USS Iowa,"" you'll learn the history of this individual ship. If you do just a bit of research prior to visiting you will have a MUCH greater appreciation of what you're seeing and realize just what an important part of American history you're standing on.Wheelchairs or strollers are NOT allowed on the tour. There are numerous narrow stairways that have to be navigated. Also, for those with toddlers, you cannot use the backpack type carriers. You'll end up hitting your kid's head on the numerous low overhangs. Bring a bottle of water. There are water vending machines on the tour, but they aren't cheap. Also, use the restroom facilities before entering the ship. There are none on the ship. Unlike opening day, the lines are no longer out of control, and things are much better organized. Take the time to watch the video in the museum at the end of the tour. There are two videos. One is a CG reenactment of the guns firing in combat...it's cool, but doesn't give much info. It just lasts a few minutes. The other is from The Military Channels ""Top Ten Fighting Ships""...and yes, you're standing on number one! It's a good 5 minute video that gives a wealth of information about the ship. Take the time to sit on one of the benches on the main deck, imagining the thousands of young men serving throughout the decades...and all the hustle and bustle going on both during wartime and peacetime. Enjoy your visit, and keep in mind what you pay in admission is going toward to improving and maintaining the ship for the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cgopat
50,Well Worth Visiting,"If you are in the South Bay / San Pedro area of Los Angeles make sure you take the time to visit the USS Iowa. They offer an excellent tour at a very reasonable price. The tour options are going to be expanded in the future to include other areas of the ship such as the engine room, etc. The volunteers located along the route of the tour are extremely helpful and in many cases speak from first hand experience. This is a great addition to San Pedro and compliments the Liberty Ship Lane Victory tour which has been there for many years.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larrywatsonl
50,Awesome battleship,Located in LA harbor this battleship is a part of history not to be missed by military afficionados. We walked around all the accessible areas of the ship including various rooms and saw many guns and missile launchers. Many of the displays were informative and provided a history of the ship. Many parts of the ship are not open to the public but will be in the future once it is fully restored. Parking is ample and reasonably priced.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mags2198
50,Moved to LA,"this battleship is now in Los Angeles, CA (since July 2013).Fascinating (mostly self-guided) tour, with plenty of knowledgeable volunteer docents along the way. Huge guns/missile launchers with amazing distance (some 1500 miles) capability.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LwindVta
50,"58,000 tons of fun!",A great tour with more areas to be opened up in the future. True history!The ship is in surprisingly good condition. Many of the docents are ex navy with several of them serving aboard this ship. There is a wealth of knowledge available.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SW3Taco
30,Saw less than expected,"My two sons ages 10 & 12 really enjoyed touring this ship, especially all the weaponry. It is a self guided tour, and the tour had very little posted information about what we were seeing. It also covered only a small portion of the interior of the ship. A sign at the end indicated the tour is a work in progress, and much more will be available in the future. I think we will visit again in a couple of years to see if more is available to visit on the ship.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vaykayfam
50,"Very awesome, The best floating museum ever floated",The funnest timei ever had on a floating museum. The staff is really nice and knows a lot of info. The ship is in good shape. But the decks need help but it is a work in progress. Butit is a great price for the admission price to keep the iowa. Hope this serves for a long time educating people. It is also great to take photos of the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scubasean1023
50,Grand Battleship,"You will have already read other reviews with all the details of the ship, so I'll spare you from repeating them all. Overall, it is a beautiful ship with many missile launchers, grand artillary, captins quarters, and beautiful views from the ship. The USS Iowa was just recently opened in July 2012, so there are many new exhibits to come in the future. It only took our family 2 hrs to get through the ship very thouroughly and we had no lines at any time, so I wonder if some of the other reviewers went on opening day. There are bathrooms but they are not located on the ship, so use the facilities before you board. There really is no stroller access due to the steep stairs and some narrow passages; as on other battleships I've toured. The ship is such a beautiful historical experience, I would highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWind26
40,A piece of history in need of help,This was my first visit to a battleship. The old ship is showing her age and needs much upkeep. Anyone interested in history or having a patriotic bent will enjoy an hour or two touring a vessel that was closely involved in U.S. history from the 1940’s through the 1990’s. Pictures and descriptions can’t fully give the since of grandeur of the real thing.I was most fascinated by tiny bed that served as the captain’s berth and in which FDR slept on his way to the Tehran Conference with Churchill and Stalin.The upkeep and restoration is privately funded. I hope people will take visit this historic vessel and keep it in shape for future generations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Professor-Zero
50,Battleship Experience,"Best attraction on the West Coast. The 58,200 ton, 887 foot long, Iowa was the lead ship of the last class of battleships the USN built being completed in 1943. Iowa served in WWII Korea and the Cold War. The ship was placed out of service in 1990. The Iowa class are considered the powerful battleships ever built.In 2012 the ship was moved from the bay area and is now opened to visitors daily. Much of the ship is now accessible by the public with much more to be opened as time permits. Come down to San Pedro at the foot of the 110 freeway in Los Angeles Harbor and view this living monument to the men and women who served our country. The tour includes the main deck the wardroom with artwork of battleship Iowa by noted naval artist Wayne Scarpaci. The three triple 16"" gun turrets, the bridge and conning tower. The captains cabin with the famous bathtub installed for FDR The missile decks and the ship's museum, a full wall battle simulator and the ship's gift shop. The crew is incredible very friendly knowledgeable and helpful. A 'must see' for visitors of all ages to the LA area. Well worth the 18 dollar gate fee, and discount are offered for military, seniors and children visit their website at wwwpacificbattleship.com for details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikem496
20,It's not ready for the public - save your $$$!,"The USS Iowa battleship (BB 62) has been on display in San Pedro, CA just 5 weeks. We were charged the full admissiion rate of $15/person for something that is not ready for the public - !. When we asked for a brochure we were told, 'we don't have them yet' adding that there were helpful signs to guide us and docents who could answer questions. This seemed OK at the time. Truth is, there should have been signs, especially warnings regarding steep ladders, loose chain holds for climbing, uneven surfaces, etc., but there weren't. The once beautiful teak deck is rotting from years of exposure so plywood was fastened over it with the expectation that the public would stay off the teak- ! We concluded that it would be just a matter of time before someone injured themselves from one thing or another. The docents are minimal and only the veterans (very few) were able to answer questions. If you're thinking of making a visit, be aware that it takes 5 hours to get through it, it gets very hot and there's no water or bathroom facilities onboard. It gets so hot that people are close to fainting before they get to the one place that's blowing cool air. The ship is powered only with a generator so that may explain it. We were also disappointed that the crew quarters were off limits 'because they hadn't been cleaned up yet,' nor did we see the sick bay, engine room, and other places of interest. We were advised, however, to be sure and see the movie of the ship, which turned out to be a videogame rendition - ! Geez! Isn't there some actual footage somewhere, for this proud ship that sailed the world and participated in several wars? This IOWA is not ready for the public; save your time and money.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalMare
40,Inspiring and Nostalgic,"We went for the official opening day of the USS Iowa as a floating museum at its new home in San Pedro, California. Even though TripAdvisor has not yet updated the Iowa from its former berth in Richmond, CA, please be aware that this review highlights its new home in San Pedro, CA. The opening day’s festivities were very exciting with many former Iowa officers and sailors on board. The ship is very impressive and almost everyone had pictures taken as they posed before its big guns. There were huge crowds of people being shuttled to the various exhibit areas, and at times it was very slow going. There’s also a lot of climbing for those with physical limitations.As time goes on, and the crowds thin out, it will be much easier to proceed from one area to another. It is my understanding that less than 10% of the ship is currently available for tour, but that the goal at a future time is for more specialized tours with about 95% of the ship available.As a former Navy officer, I was very impressed with the condition of the ship and the nostalgia it created. Opening day was particularly inspiring with so many volunteers who were obviously very proud of the Iowa. This is the Ship of Presidents, having welcomed U.S. Presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George H.W. Bush. An interesting artifact in the Captain’s stateroom is the bathtub which was specially designed for President Roosevelt’s Atlantic crossing in November 1943, as he journeyed to the Tehran Conference where he secretly secret met with Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek. One of the docents told us that no other ship in the entire U.S. Navy has a bathtub installed!We enjoyed our tour on a beautiful day and will return again as more areas of the ship are opened for tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrequentTraveller034
30,USS Iowa BB-61 San Pedro CA (not Richmond CA),"The ship opened for public viewing July 7, 2012 at the San Pedro CA harbor. The tour, which is said to be self-guided is nonetheless more group-like in that once in line, guides try to keep a person in that place throughout the tour.The tour itself is only of a few of the upper decks and with limited interior access (walkways to Captain's chambers, the FDR bathtub, officer's lounge, crew mess hall/gift shop, which sells bottled sodas and souvenir items `Made in China.') Along the route there is some information about various historic events and ship design via signs, but not much in the way of specifics from guides.Too, parents with strollers are best advised to walk the baby from the car to the ship and to bring ample water for all, as strollers are not allowed and there is no water nor toilet available on board. (This was announced to my group only AFTER standing in line for tickets for 45 minutes and after standing in line for ticket verification for 20 minutes and after standing in line for boarding for 30 minutes.) The tour then takes about 75-90 minutes but you can stay longer on deck (as long as you do not try to go against traffic.)After the tour I went into downtown San Pedro on 6th and 7th streets where the guidebook says many art studios and sit-down restaurants are situated, but where I found only two studios and one restaurant which were open.Snapshots from my opening-day tour can be viewed at http://www.flickr.com/photos/guyatree/sets/72157630486864594/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STARwitness
