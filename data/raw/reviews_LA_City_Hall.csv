10,Yawn,Thoughtful design of a place where some of the most thoughtless public policy and master planning emanates. Skip it...,Zachary Matz
40,A stand-out building,Haven't been inside but it is in a dominant location and just love walking past it and enjoying the art deco architecture. Helps illustrate why Santa Monica is so different to the rest of L.A.,RonWamberal
50,Wonderful location,Right near the promenade...walk by these lovely buildings and see Santa Monica History....surprising location for government building,Faye F
40,A busy city hall,"This is a busy place. There are many high profile cases tried. If you have time, you can easily see someone notable.",Samuel M
20,why visit?,The tile surrounding the entrance is the only element of interest for a visit. Interior is mid-20th century industrial.City Council chambers are nicer and more comfortable than most municipalities.,ConduitConsulting
50,Art Deco splendor,Go inside if its open. The lobby and stairs are a testament to a time when construction and craftsmanship mattered. Really beautiful.,JudyA
40,Cool building,"Stumbled upon it. It's across the steer from a really cool park. The building is beautiful. We didn't go inside, but thought it was cool enough from a distance to walk over and check it out.",Jennifer K
20,Why are you here? Bailing someone out of jail?,"There is nothing to see here folks. The buildings are not unique and are quite bland.The courthouse is located near as is the police department.Unless you have business there, I can not think of one reason you would want to go there, unless one your friends needs bail money.There is not a decent place to eat in sight, it is boring, you will pay to park.The locals go there for business, like court hearings.There is nothing here, keep moving.",elizabethlascheid
40,Pretty Building and Friendly Enough Personnel,"I have been in this building many times. I used to volunteer as a Commissioner for the City of Santa Monica. You can generally come here Tuesday nights to listen to a City Council Meeting or even grab a ""chit"" (small sheet of paper) to write your name down so you get about 1-2 minutes to address City Council about an issue. There is ample parking nearby and beautiful plants and grass in front of the building. This is also where various City of SM departments are located such as the Department of Buildings, etc.",Melissa D
50,Historic Santa Monica,"Walk through City Hall. Take your time and stroll though early 20th Century Santa Monica. Check out the photos, too.",SMOgal
30,Nice to look at. Period,Really pretty building designed in the art deco style. wouldnt do more than just drive by or walk by- it is a public office building really nothing to do but look at it. but nice look!,allison r
40,Deco Delight in Shoreline Santa Monica,"As LA suburban public buildings go, this one is a jewel. I suspect the 1930s architect may have been strongly influenced by Emperor Ming's Palace in the old Flash Gordon movies. Or maybe he even designed the sets. Take that wonderful parti-colored front door surround, say. Or the tall inner court around an ornate floor inset with a broad, brassy rendering of the city's official Mermaid. Interesting tile work. Lots of handcrafted deco details. Worth lingering in for a long, appreciative gaze-around. Comfortable, well kept lobby rest rooms available for the relief of pedestrian shoreline tourists. Generally nice helpful people. Handsome fountain, lawn and gardens out front and you are right across from that new park. Of course it houses some fairly weird local politics, but you can't have everything.",NyakaNyaka
50,It's Worth A Stop,"If you enjoy history like I do, I highly recommend that you check out Santa Monica City Hall. The building has beautiful architectural details that are reminiscent of a bygone era. There are real wood accents and art deco details that are noteworthy for anyone that has an interest in history and buildings. So many things in Santa Monica are changing, it's definitely worth stopping by City Hall to view the beautiful lobby. It's also worth your time to spend a few minutes reflecting on the beauty of Ken Genser Square in front of the building. It's a great place for photos and to take a short break to rest your feet. This is a family friendly location with clean public restrooms.",Debra S
40,Modern Deco design with a nice fountain for the seagulls,"We were in the park to the west of the building which is a super nice place. My daughter enjoyed the seagulls who were drinking from the fountain out front. Fun to watch them fly over the building and make a precision landing in the fountain. The building is a bit stark, but nice to see they haven't torn it down to build some elaborate glass structure.",Veni-vidi-vicidotcom
20,why bother going?,"despite its classic spanish exterior, this place is as boring as it gets. unless you're looking to grab a building permit oro have city business, there is absolutely no reason to ever enter this place.",pandpCalifornia
50,Artsy Santa Monica,A very chic 1930's structure with lovely murals in the lobby. The new Tonga Park an exceptional architectural creation is across the street. The place is high end artsy. Would one expect less from Santa Monica? No never !,paul_nancy1
