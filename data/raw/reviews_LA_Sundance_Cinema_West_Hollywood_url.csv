50,no kids!,"they accept Movie Pass, the seats are comfy, screens and sound are great, they serve food and booze....go!",JohnRyan724
40,Another movie theater concept,I like this place but I feel it is overpriced yet I go there all the time . A good place to find variety in film and special events .,Carol S
50,FRONT COVER,"This theater should be called FRONT COVER and not just the movie. I loved it. It was warm, inviting and comfortable. BTW - Saw the movie Front Cover there and it was FANTASTIC. It's really a must see if you are a movie lover. But, back to the theater. The parking was easy, they validate in the theater, the food was good and the coffee was perfect. Really nice all the way around.",Ric O
50,A thousand times yes,"Everything about this place is my favorite. It isn't crowded, you can eat, you can drink, they serve alcohol, there aren't any children. Plus, every seat has a great view, and a little table next to it. This place is ideal for couples. It also costs less than going to one of the larger theatres.",DoctorFodrey
50,Not your grandfather's arthouse cinema (and that's great!),"Even though I live less than 10 minutes away, I avoided this theater for some time, mistakingly assuming it was overpriced and parking was expensive and difficult. That's because it's located at a prime location (Sunset Blvd. at Crescent Heights) across from the Laugh Factory comedy club and amid a cluster of trendy shops and restaurants.One lazy day I surfed to Sundance's website and discovered they offer flat $6 ticket prices all day to every movie each Tuesday, and they validate parking. Why not give Sundance a try?I'm so glad I did! The theater is a gem, with a lavish concession stand/bar offering an array of curated wine and beer selections along with barista coffee bar choices and upscale food and snacks. The alcoholic beverages are welcomed in each of their five (maybe six?) theaters at any movie showing, as far as I can tell, and most or all of the comfortable seats are provided with a handy sidetable,, which not only accommodates your drinks and food, but expands your privacy and the personal space between you and other audience members. There seem to be various configurations of seating and tables available to suit groups as well.The theaters I've been to screenings in are moderately sized to compact, but not objectionably small. They still offer a quality cinema experience with excellent projection and, in at least one case, superb sound (a showing of ""Love and Mercy,"" the Brian Wilson/Beach Boys biopic, has an opening sound melange that is beautifully, soulfully mixed, and I never would have experienced it watching the film at home on DVD or Blu-Ray. I know, because I liked the film so much I later rented it to watch again at home. The experience was disappointing. That's why there's no substitute for good movie theaters. End of mini-rant.)Sundance screens mostly independent films that don't receive wide distribution which, along with foreign films, are my pot of tea. Therefore, I could easily spend my Tuesdays all day at the Sundance, serially watching hard-to-find films. Once I discovered it, Sundance quickly rose to a top position on my list of preferred theaters, right next to ArcLight Hollywood.But I don't patronize ArcLight, as appealing a venue as it is, nearly as often as I do Sundance. Why? Ticket prices are now at $17 at ArcLight, and their discounts are almost nonexistent, negligible really. For the price of one ArcLight movie admission, I can see damn near three films at Sundance (on Tuesdays, at least). What Sundance concedes in terms of grand, big-screen glory, it wins back in pure value and intimacy. Sundance is your loyal hometown girlfriend who always greets you with a warm smile; ArcLight is the striking big-city debutante with airs, who just might leave you waiting at the altar.You pays your money, and you takes your choice. Often, Sundance is the better, wiser and more satisfying choice.",BabyBayard
20,View Upon Others As You Would Have Them View Upon You!,"Remarkably uncomfortable movie-going experience where-in the clucking and food chomping audience apparently think that they are more important than the film being shown. If it weren't for the $6 Tuesday special, I would never go back, as the hell hole like parking situation is also an excuse for fools to show off their shortcomings.",ElOsoTerrible
50,"Great theatre, food, parking","Love this theatre. Parking is free up to 3 hours (convenient), the food options are convenient to do dinner in a movie, and the theatres themselves are really comfortable and clean. I HATE uncomfortable seats, and these seats recline gently and the tables in between the seats are nice. Also, the reserved seating is a plus when you're ordering food. Their Tuesday Student of Life deal is just the best little secret around. Not pretentious, and the 21 plus makes it even more enjoyable, no screaming children in movies they should never be allowed to see in the first place.",Elizabeth K
30,Not a good theatre,"I wish this space would be better than it is. Unfortunately, it is not a good experience for filmgoers (in my opinion). They sell food like fries, nachos, pizza, and alcoholic drinks. Everything super expensive (5 bucks for a small coke). It turns out that put beer in the theatre it's not a great idea. The seats are not as comfortable as in other movie theaters, like La Emmle or even AMC. And to be fair, the two times I've been there, the theatre wasn't cleaned.However, they do have a good selection of films, which is why I used to go there sometimes.",Pedro S
50,Great Experience,"This place has restored my faith in cinemas. I just need to find one in Wales now! It was very clean, comfortable, extremely polite staff and we were able to enjoy the film without being disturbed by other customers. All in all a very pleasurable experience.",felicityma
50,"21+ Comfort, Good Food, Nice Staff","A great way to shed the kids and actually watch a movie without obvious distractions. The food selections (which include gratuity) are plentiful and tasty, especially the pizzas, and the counter staff courteous and helpful. Prices are rather inexpensive, too, including for wine and beer or non-alcoholic beverages from designer sodas to lattes. Each theater is sizable with comfortable high-back rockers, the latest picture and sound equipment, and a large side table between every other seat. Parking is funky in that it is shared with other businesses and the lot itself is annoyingly tight. Take your ticket because it can only be processed once inside the lobby; further, no stamp is added when scanned, which might make some uneasy with the thought of being stuck at the unmanned exit with an unlogged ticket. Aside from that, a much nicer movie-going overall --- at least for us adults!!",SmarterBear
50,"Great movies, no kids, decent food","The movies are first rate, or at least interesting. The food is quite good for a movie house. No one under 21 is allowed, so there's no danger that you will have a crying child or chatty teen distracting you from your enjoyment. Comfortable seats. A bit pricy, but good valuie nonetheless.",LATraveller77
50,Comfy Cinema,"Great, luxurious film experience. So glad I got to see Snowpiercer here. Patrons respect the moviewatching experience, didn't have to ask anyone to put their phones away or to stop talking during the film. I'll be coming here whenever Arclight doesn't have the independent film I'm dying to see.",thiscozyskull
50,Art House Films with Snack Bar that has Drinks,"Beautiful, newly restored multiplex movie theater specializing in first-run indie films, and located at the East end of the world-famous SUNSET STRIP (8000 Sunset Blvd, 2nd Level). Food was great, including alcoholic drinks, and environment felt like a private luxury screening as if me and my buds were studio heads... we can always dream. An A+ venue. The complex it's located in is very pretty at night with Japanese lanterns and such -- great vibe all-round!",Joey C
50,excellent film here,I love that the Sundance Cinema is here now. They did a great job renovating the old Laemmle Sunset 5 - Great films !Thank you Robert Redford!,Dolla Yo
40,Catch an Independent Film on Sunset Blvd,What a beautiful movie experience. Lots of off beat films to choose from. The theaters are beautifully remodeled and very comfortable. Great beer and wine selection as well.,Needlepointaddict
50,Most comfortable,"The renovated old Sunset 5 is a great theater. The stadium seating is great, and they offer some nice upscale upscale food selections, not typical of movie theaters....you can still get popcorn and candy, but if you get there hungry, you will not be disappointed",Ronwol
