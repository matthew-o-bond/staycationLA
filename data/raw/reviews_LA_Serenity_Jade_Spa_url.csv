50,Romantic vibe.,"Me and my husband decided to get a couple massage for our anniversary. It was a great experience, it took me a while to find the location but it is next to the dentist office on the corner. They took us to the back room and has us take off our clothes and lay under the sheet. Room was very nice, they had a basket for all of your clothes. They ask if you want medium or hard before they start. The masseuse hit every spot, it was very relaxing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lindaramos213
