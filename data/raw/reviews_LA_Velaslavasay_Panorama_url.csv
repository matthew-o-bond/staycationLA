10,Closed until 2019,I went to visit on a Tuesday afternoon and was told they had been closed for a year and wouldnâ€™t be open until sometime next year. There are events on during some weekends but no panoramas to see at the moment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bensE8346JN
40,Very unusual / a step back in time,"I visited this with a family member last time I was in LA. I thought it was fascinating. Before film, tv and world travel accessible by just about anyone, they had these ""Panorama Theaters"", where you could get a glimpse of distant lands.This is one of the last ones --- Climb the stairs and you'll find yourself on a central observation deck surrounded by Arctic scenes, accompanied by a howling wind sound track. Very kitschy, and might be underwhelming unless you can imagine living back in the early 1900s, and trying to imagine the Arctic that they'll never see in person.The garden was nice also.To see some great photos of the V Panorama, go to LA Explorer and find the article ""Visiting Velaslavasay Panorama""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rollngstone
30,Unique to me,Well this place was unique to me. As I have no sense of reference to compare this to I gave it 3 stars.Apparently this was a form of art work many years ago. Basically you're surrounded by artwork so you can imagine yourself in a far off place.There is a small garden in the back of the building. The one staff member was as helpful as she could be.I actually found the old building to be more interesting than the artwork.Parking is non-existent. You have to find somewhere along the street to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G4264SYmarkb
20,Good Effort,"I wanted to like this museum. Panoramas like this were once popular attractions and this museum preserves the memory. First a small space has temporary art exhibits. Then a narrow corridor leads to a theater and an outdoor tranquil garden behind the building. I almost missed the panorama off to the side through another narrow corridor and up a small winding stair.In the days before TV, movies, and air travel, this is how people saw the world. A scene from some exotic location would be painted on this 360 degree canvas and people would envision these locations.There are many presentations throughout the year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
