50,A wonderful local live theater - celebrating 60+ years of entertainment,"Went once again to an amazing performance of BRIGHT STAR (from Steve Martin) - full of singing, dancing and bluegrass music. The cast of professionals brought a tear to my eyes with the poignant story of a lost baby found. This theater is a gem, founded and run by a local family it is the oldest continuously operating private theater group in the nation. You can see a ton of 99 seat theater performances on the west side of LA but this place is a story in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Passenger748152
50,A Glendale Gem!,"Lovely, theatre in the round. Quality productions presenting a mix of old and new. Comfortable seats, ample bathrooms, and refreshments you can take into theatre ! Just saw Brightstar and was so wowed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9551CVpamelam
50,Old school since 1947,It's great to see a multi generation family business still thriving. We came by on a Wednesday evening to see A Christmas Carol and we enjoyed it very much. I'm always amazed how the actors remember their lines without making a visible error. The stage props and Little Tim who didn't forget his lines were the highlight of the play. Get those teenage kids off the couch and away from their phones and bring them to a holiday play where the family can enjoy an evening out on the town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Creeping_Death_LA
30,"Need 2 sets of stars to fairly rate, one for play and one for building..","This is the best and worst of the Theatre. I was invited to Annie here and the show was wonderful, It is in the round and it was great, however I am physically challenged and there are stairs everywhere. Thank god I didn't drink much of anything as the bathrooms are up another full flight of stairs and I had problems getting forth and back to my seat......... Really there should be a law for handicapped accessible the theatre was full of old people.....with their grandchildren. I know older buildings sometimes have a granny clause, but this building is hideous and I'm sure they could work out ramps or single floor bathroom, or even to get in and out of the building.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllaO722
50,Amazingly professional performance,"The theatre is small and charming - run by a family for decades. What is nice is that it is not too large. Seats surround the stage and every seat is good. Front row seats are like being on stage - suggest a few rows up. I saw ""Annie"" and thought it was never my favorite, it was very entertaining - better than the movie. Choreograph was terrific.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5745KWrichardb
50,Annie The Musical playing until September 14th,"Don't miss this fabulous show, getting standing ovations every performance and rated ""WOW"" on SCENIELA and THE GEEK review. Wonderful talented cast and fun for the whole family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoehoward1152
50,The Glendale Centre Theatre is the best place to see shows!,"I have been going to the Glendale Centre Theatre for over 30 years! I really enjoy this theatre very much. The shows I have seen are very professionally done, and the actors are delightful. This is a great place to take a date especially if your date enjoys theatre productions. The Glendale Centre Theatre performs comedy plays, and musicals. This place really shines when they do a musical. The stage may be small but somehow the actors make it seem large when they perform there. It is truly remarkable how they can do this. The entire staff is great, they give you the highest in customer service, and courtesy. The staff at the Glendale Centre Theatre always make me feel welcome when I visit. The tickets are very affordable. In fact, you won't find a better theatre value for your money. If you are ever in the area please come visit the Glendale Centre Theatre, you won't be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Russ55555
50,"Love the enriching experience in this theater in the round & the actors ""touch"" you!","I have been here a few times to watch, or should I say - engage - with the actors in the play. I love the theater in the round where everyone gets such an enlightening experience. The actors feel so close and engaging with you! This quaint theater, tucked out of the lime light, deserves to be experienced. I suggest you get your tickets now!

Ate in Glendale and made an evening of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelene2016
50,Found on Trip Advisor! Great show and venue.,"We took in the Sunday afternoon matinee. Us country folk had a hard time finding a parking spot. My beloved pointed to four hour parking on the street with a meter. Unfortunately, we had jettisoned almost all our change for lighter pockets and purse. Greedy little monster! We scrounged up two dollars and ten cents and were still short of two hours. We headed down to theater for change: the lady at the door said ""Sure!"" then thought for a moment. ""It's free on Sunday"" she exclaimed. Then she bolted out the door to a parking sign and came back smiling. Actually free! Well, no refunds......The theater is in the round and stadium seating, so there are no bad seats. We sat on the aisle in the second row: eye level with the 5 actors.The performance right now is ""Church Basement Ladies."" Very funny. Strong, believable cast. A very good time and something to think about too.If you're in the area, don't miss the show at GCT!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChinaLake1

50,Good wholesome entertainment,The Glendale Center theater has a significant repertory of shows. This unique experience allows everyone to get closer to the performance than is otherwise the case. The audience has the opportunity to meet the cast in a family-friendly environment. Season tickets are encouraged for all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246skipb
50,West Side Story....,"We went to closing night of West Side Story. I loved this show. Maria, Tony, Anita, and Riff were perfectly cast. Special shout out to Action. I appreciated the full use of the space, as actors moved up and down the aisles and into the pit. Theater in the round is a difficult beast, yet all of the actors showed that they understood how to play it. I noticed the lighting design, that re-directed attention while sets were placed in the dark. Even down to the diagonals of the curtain call, this show was meticulously developed. If this -- my first exposure to GCT -- is any indication, I will be back for many more. Thanks, everyone...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/assessmenttraini2016
50,Enjoyable Friday Night at the Theatre,"We have been coming to the Glendale Centre Theatre on and off for close to forty years. I love that it is in the round and has that intimate feel. The production of Mark Twain's ""IS HE DEAD?"" was one of the most hilarious plays I have ever seen. It really had me in stitches. The acting was just wonderful, especially by the lead character. The theatre was pretty full as there was only one week left for this particular play. We will continue to return.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CacheOn
40,Really Good Show,"Saw their rendition of Mark Twain' s IS HE DEAD YET?. A great acting by all. The theater is in the round, with adequate special effects. The audience only filled half the seats available, but it was the afternoon show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenrr
40,Good venue to see local theater,"We have seen a number of productions, usually musicals come at this venue and we have never been disappointed. With the centerstage and surrounded by seats, you get an intimate theatrical experience. There is no assigned seating so it's probably best to come a little bit earlier so you can choose your seats. There is reasonably priced parking nearby and some nice restaurants. Overall, a good place to catch local community theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc

50,Never disappointing!,"Bye Bye Birdie last week was so much fun! We've tried to catch a production when we're in the area and have always enjoyed the top notch production. This unique theater has seating on all sides of the floor, so you won't find a bad seat. There is a handicapped section available with easy entrance/exit and a handy bathroom. Actors are all top notch. My inlaws are season ticket holders and have been for several years. Great, affordable entertainment for the whole family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takrafty
50,Always great!,"We have been going to plays at Glendale Centre Theatre for several years and have not been disappointed. The plays they have are top notch, well done, acted and directed. Musicals are our favorite, followed by comedies. Sometimes they have musical comedies, a double treat. It is a theater in the round. Four sides for seating with no bad seats; it’s just a matter of preference. The actors learn to play to all sides. What’s amazing is how well a major production can play on the small stage. Musicals with dance numbers are especially fun to watch. With everything, how well the actors interact with each other, like they truly care, is something we always marvel about. Is it the producer and directors that foster that kind of atmosphere?People come from all over the area and beyond to this wonderful theater. We would recommend it to anyone. We always leave happier having thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Thank you dear cousin for giving us season tickets!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doncarolyns

40,A Christmas Carol,This theater boasts a very long running production of A Christmas Carol and it was very well done. The show is done with the seats wrapping around the whole theater with the play happening in the middle. The actors were great and had excellent voices. The show was punctuated with Christmas carols that really got us into the season. It was quite fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishakelley
40,Old Time Entertainment,"I have lived in Glendale for 50 years and I think this theatre group has been around almost that long. They like to present many plays that are very popular with a senior age group. Our church group likes to have social events there. The plays are well done with examples like ""Damn Yankees"" etc. The theatre is family owned and operated by several generations, A good night out if you are over 50!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendalemom
40,A wizard of a time!,"We took our three young granddaughters to see The Wizard of Oz on our recent visit to Glendale. This was a great time!This theater in the round has nothing but fine seats, and we were especially impressed with the costuming, energy, and professionalism of this community group. They do three children's shows a year with several performances, including matinees. They also present drama for the older crowd and run a theater camp in the summer. We look forward to going again the next time we visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flasuz
50,Nice theater in the round,"This theater has been here since the mid 1940's. It is quaint, and relatively small. Every few months, they have a different play. Usually the acting is pretty good. Overall, a good experience, where just about every seat is good because it is a theater in the round, so the whole crowd can see all the action going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveltrivia
40,An amazing find...,"I was a parent volunteer when I came here. The theater was a small and cozy, with a European, old theater feel. We watched Beauty and the Beast and it was awesome! The actors kept the viewers engaged. It was a great short version of the story. (an hour or so). It was filled with a crowd of mostly school aged children, and I believe everybody enjoyed the show including us, adults. They do birthday parties and summer camps too!I would surely come back and watch another play!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
50,Hidden Gem!,I was amazed to see this really small theatre be so beautiful and have such a talented cast! I went to see My Fair Lady. It was just perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mqueliz
50,Excellent Neighborhood Theatre,"The Glendale Center Theatre is a wonderful family experience. Reasonably priced, comfortable seats and easy freeway access from the I 5 or the 134. I've never seen a performance I haven't throughly enjoyed. I'd suggest getting there early and going to Damon's Steak House right behind the theatre for a delicious steak dinner before the play. You won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KathleenC763
50,An Entertaining Experience,"We have been going to the Glendale Centre Theatre on and off for decades. After our most recent visit to see Arsenic & Old Lace, I think we need to come more often! As others have mentioned, there is not a bad seat in this theatre in the round. I love how intimate the place feels and how close you are to the actors. The comedies are our favorites, but I like the musicals too. I did learn that Damon's Restaurant nearby offers a 10% discount if you present your theatre tickets. We always make it a dinner and theatre evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CacheOn
40,A Very Good Theater Experience,"For over 60 years, the Glendale Center Theater has been presenting great programs. Last night was no exception. We began with dinner at a nearby restaurant, and then walked over to the theater. The cast provided us with a well-acted and very funny rendition of Arsenic and Old Lace. The theater was filled to capacity. (There’s not a bad seat in the entire place.) We had a wonderful time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,Still terrific 30 years later!,"We went to this theatre to Arsenic and Old Lace recently. It was wonderful. We used to attend the theatre here all the time when we lived in the area. Now... 30 years later, it is still producing good quality theatre at a reasonable price. No bad seats in the house",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223lauria
50,"Glendale Center Theater, Where The Action Is Always Live!","The Glendale Center Theater just celebrated it's 68th anniversary and offers the best entertainment value available.The theater is in-the-round and features live plays thoughout the year. Currently, Guys And Dolls is running and I saw it last Saturday evening. What a fantastic performance! Well acted with great choreography and at a price that anyone can afford. Each play is less then $25.00 and if you purchase a season pass, the price is even less. Try it, you'll like it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/westlakelen
40,Better than your average community theatre,"We saw 'Guys & Dolls' on a Friday night, about 80% full in this 300 seat theatre in the round - no bad seats.

50,Love this little venue,"Every seat in the house is great! This theater provides interactive plays for both adults and children. The actors are awesome! You can catch a matinee with the kids at 11am and then go to lunch anywhere in downtown. The best part of the theater is that they offer a Summer Program for the kids!!! They learn improv, dance, drama, and movie making! Check out the website for opportunities for your little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/4CarmenL2014
30,intimate,"It's theatre in the round and every seat is a good one. If you can overlook that the stage and seating is a little tired, you're in for a talented cast and a performance that is intimate. It's worth supporting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindacK3474MJ
40,Big time talent in a tiny theater,"We have had season tickets for two years now, and attended performances before that. This is a fun little theater in the round that works hard to have good talent available and make the theater experience fun. There isn't a bad seat in the house, but I admit I do avoid the first row when they have a large cast and a musical...those kicks and dance moves look just a bit too close for my peace of mind. They love to put on musicals, mysteries and period pieces. They often have special performances for children to experience live theater. Theater here is fun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finessa
40,Every seat is a good seat,I've been going to this theater since I was a kid. It's so small and the seating is shaped as a circle. In the middle is the show floor. It reminds me of one of the Las Vegas small show rooms but smaller. Parking is metered but the location is in a nice area. Some nice restaurants too such as Jax Bar and Grill and Damon's that you can grab a bite before the show. I recommend showing up early thought because the line will be long and the parking can be challenging. The theater is great for all ages!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/480heidid
50,I love this theater!,"I have only seen a few productions at this theater, but they were both wonderful.The theater is in the round and there is not a bad seat in the house. It is so intimate its awesome.If you like good musicals go see them here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pudljmpr
50,Man of La Mancha in Glendale - amazing production; fantastic theater!!!!,"I took 13 friends to see last Saturday's matinee of Man of La Mancha at the Glendale Centre Theatre and it was FANTASTIC!!!! The theatre is lovely! Seats are first come-first served - so be there when the doors open an hour before showtime. But don't worry because there's not a bad seat in the house.Aside from the surprisingly lovely theatre, the quality of the production was astonishing!! The voices, the acting, the direction, the choreography, and the overall interpretation of the material - it was SO good I can't imagine it would have been any better had we seen it at the Ahmundson!It's been 30 some years since the first time I saw this musical. And this production brought it all back and then some!!! Do NOT miss this opportunity!My friends were equally impressed - and they're not the musical theater lover that I am. But they so enjoyed the show that there was general agreement that we'll definitely go back for other shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/995randiw

50,Man of La Mancha -- WOW !!!,First time attending GCT....with Community Theater you never know what you are going to get. So I booked Man of La Mancha with a little bit of faith --- Wow am I glad I did - What a show - it was tremendous - a lot of fun. Laughs and a few Tears. I was very impressed with the venue (not a bad seat in the house) -- but I was more impressed with the quality of the performance - very Broadway worthy - especially the 3 leads !!! Took my wife and my Teenage son. Yes we were on the younger scale of the average age in the audience - but we had a blast (even my son). After dinner we went to El Morfi - grill and continued our nice Sunday afternoon into evening. Note - the parking structure is opposite the Sears parking structure a little south of the theater. --- Cheap parking with validation and dining options are a block or 2 away --- we will go again --- we have tickets booked for The Christmas Carol.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/375robo
50,Thoroughly Modern Millie,"I have been to this theater many times and this show has been, hands down, the BEST show I have seen there. In all the other shows I have attended there has always been at least one weak performer, but this show had all strong performers, great story line, and very well executed.One thing they could improve is to shorten the owner's opening monologue of announcements. However, it did give me plenty of time to visit the rest room without missing the show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBA-Editor
40,"1st Come, 1st Serve Style Seating At This Theater!","Came here in October (2013) to see Hairspray the Musical on it's last showing date. Here is just a quick word of advice: You MUST come early for the 1st come 1st serve style seating at this theater.My husband and I arrived 1 hour prior to the show and had no problem redeeming our tickets (purchased on line prior) and heading to the theater room. We sat in the front row on the opposite side of the main entrance. What I liked about this theater is the unique 360 viewing, so really any seat would be good (but of course sitting up closer would be easier than at the very top). One negative of where I sat would have to be that props that the talented actors used throughout the show. There would be times where a chalkboard prop would block part of my viewing and I wouldn't be able to see some of the actors dancing to the beat and such during their number.Overall, the play was excellent and would love to see another excellent musical here again.By the way, it does get rather chilly in the theater, so make sure you bring a coat or sweater.Also, we parked in the lot right next to the theater (this is a lot right behind Porto's... not a bad idea to stop by after or before your show to grab a bite to eat). I believe it is about $0.25 per 15 or 30 minutes (So parking really isn't too bad of a price... but of course free would always be better).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meowmix318
50,"My ""Home"" Theater","I performed in this theater for many years in the 1980-2000, and consider this my home theater. Theater in the round so there are no bad seats - also has stadium seating. Seating is no further than about 10 rows from the stage. Family owned since it's inception many years ago - the third generation owns it and operates it as the creators had intended. They do lots of musicals, light comedies and children's theater, and are open 52 weeks/year. It was a great place to perform - I got over my initial stage-fright as each show runs about seven weeks. I am so glad I was a part of this for so many years and am so proud of this theater and it's owners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krosmon
40,Up close theater,"Enjoy theater ""in the round"", with lots of opportunities to see the action close up. Glendale Centre Theatre puts on fun, entertaining plays and musicals, that you don't have to worry about taking your kids or your parents to see. It's a kick to have actors right in front of you or singing beside you in the aisle. Like any good theater they create an atmosphere to tell the tale, and with the smaller size of the venue you can't help but feel like part of the action. Very enjoyable!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlendaleJ
50,A great little theatre,Had season tickets last year and have renewed for this year. Each play was better than the last. They do an incredible job with a small stage to work with.

I has been established in Glendale for over 40 years that I know of, perhaps longer. The quality of the performances is outstanding. All seats have a great view. They perform several different shows per year, usually a few comedies and children's shows thrown in the mix. For a special treat, visit in December for their annual ""A Christmas Carol"". Definitely a highlight of the holiday season!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inajeanb
50,Great Little Theater,"If you enjoy live theater and you can leave your cell phone life for 2 hours, then this place is for you! There are no bad seats in this stage in the round theater. Plenty of leg room, fresh baked cookies at the front concession stand and lots of friendly employees in the house. This is a family run theater that rivals the big houses. I have seen many productions here and have enjoyed them all. They also have children's theater on Saturday afternoons. Support live theater and visit this amazing venue. They will be doing a production of Hairspray in August. Do not miss it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8puck

40,Great Performances at a Reasonable Price,"You can't beat the Glendale Centre Theatre for up close and personal performances in the round. We have held a FlexPass for years (reasonable season ticket, reserve any night). Last night we saw 39 Steps, which was superbly performed, fast, witty, and fun. Every seat is up close and personal. The place opens one hour before the performance and seats are on a first come, first served basis, so plan to get there at least 45 minutes early. This historic theater has been in operation for over 60 years and also features theater for children on Saturdays. Our family has made it a tradition to attend their annual CHRISTMAS CAROL...always great fun! One can expect to get a ticket for under $22 a performance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristieC665
40,Cute historic theatre,"There are no bad seats in this small theatre. It is a friendly family run theatre which has good shows: the Saturday morning shows are great to introduce young children to theatre and the evening shows are good even though they actors are not well-known. And most importantly you cant beat the inexpensive tickets. I like their mystery and Christmas shows, but do not recommend the musicals; they don't have the stage nor talent for that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliissa
40,Many enjoyable visits,"We have enjoyed many visits to this theater over the years. The productions are always well done, if not highly professional. They emphasize musicals. The stage is at the center of four seating areas around the auditorium. The cost is modest. This theater is a great pace to enjoy a fun night out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrancisS496
50,Theatre at its most entertaining!,"The Glendale Centre Theatre has a distinct repertoire: musical comedy, comedy, musicals, and the occasional mystery. The plays are presented in the round and always well staged. Even if you have already seen the play and know the sound-track, you are in for a treat!For those who insist upon ""serious"" theatre, this is a seriously unique place. The family seems to own the building, and a second generation of theatre professionals are making live theatre work. The actors are all talented; the directing is nearly always superb. Not to cast aspersions on any theatre, but this one can teach us all a lot about local theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eenerknirb

40,Good Hometown Feel at a Hometown Price,"This is a small family-owned theater in the round. We had season tickets last year and I enjoyed most of the shows. Since they are close to LA they have many great actors who perform. Many of them are used over and over in different roles. But it is only $25 per ticket so it is very affordable.If you are a season ticket holder, get used to the idea of the owner telling the same jokes at the beginning of the first several shows.Bring a sweater since they keep the theater rather cool for the performers. If you sit on the entrance side, get used to the vents blowing directly on you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MBA-Editor

50,Excellent quaint family theatre,"I have been to MANY plays and musicals here. It is a wonderful place to be entertained. The theater-in-the-round is an excellent way to see the action and the story-telling on such a small stage is to be admired. Sure, some of the shows have been misses, like The Nerd and Teahouse of the August Moon... but most have been hits like, Camelot, The Boyfriend, Pirates of Penzance, 10 Little Indians, Will Rogers Follies, A Christmas Carol, Beau Jest, etc. I highly recommend seeing a play or musical here.

50,Always a great show,"I've been going to the Glendale Centre Theater for over 15 years and almost every production has been thoroughly professional, even though this is not a ""professional"" theater. The productions, designs, costumes, and performances are first-rate. The current show, ""The Will Rogers Follies"" is the best show yet and is easily the best show currently playing in the Los Angeles area (it's even better than South Pacific). As good as the original broadway production. Truly memorable, excellent performances, great production. See it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveler1062

50,A tradition in our family,"From the time I was 5 years old, my family and I have gone annually to view ""A Christmas Carol"" at the Glendale Centre Theatre. Out of the many traditions we have around Christmas, this has got to be my favorite. I am now 18 years old, and the experience is never old, the talented young actors and actresses are simply fantastic in their performance, with several recurring members in the cast who help direct it yearly. Overall the warm and friendly atmosphere, with the actors and actressess occasionally breaking the fourth wall for laughs, is one of my fondest memories as a child and young adult. I highly reccommend visiting this old privately owned threater when you stop by that area, you will never walk away disappointed after a performance. I guarantee that!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilovesteak9188
50,Theatre,"My husband and I recently visited Los Angeles and on a whim caught a show at the Glendale Centre Theatre. We had the most enjoyable night out in a long time! We felt completly at home in the theatre-in-the-round and it was affordable to boot! We saw, The musical The Music Man and our tickets were only $20.00! No seat is further than 9 rows from the stage - we felt a part of the show. We stongly recommend that if you are visiting the Los Angeles area you check out this little jem of a theatre in Glendale. The people sitting around us said ""it's always this good!"" I saved the program and their number is 818-244-8481.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trek38057
