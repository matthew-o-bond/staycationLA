50,The Most well kept and Beautiful Botanical Garden in LA,We visited the Arboretum on a private tour. We just googled the exact address. We paid for 6 dollars for the entrance fees. They give student discounts and senior discounts so better bring your ID’s with you. It is the most beautiful Botanical Garden I’ve seen in LA so far. The ostriches are super fun to watch as they show off their beautiful colorful feathers. I got a souvenir ostrich feather at the gift shop for only a 1.50. The mallards at the Baldwin Lake are so graceful to watch. There are plenty of squirrels playing around and scavenging for food. Be keen too of birds nesting on the cacti. The meadow flowers are a sight to behold as well. I enjoyed the sight and smell of the citrus plants. The succulents grow wildly near the cafes. The lilies come in different species and are so colorful. The Queen Ann Cottage is a must see as well as the Meyberg Waterfall. A visit to this Botanical Garden is worth the effort. Our lungs need some pampering as well. So take time to visit the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joya63
50,Love this place!,"This is one of my favorite places to visit. The gardens are beautiful! They have greenhouses, a waterfall, a lake, a rose garden & lovely paths to walk. On top of that, the have beautifully maintained historic buildings. The barn has carriages in it, & is the only building you can enter daily. The other buildings are only open at certain times, but they are still beautiful to look at & walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylottama
50,Perfect place to take the family,"My wife and I recently signed up as members of the Los Angeles Arboretum and every time we visit and walk around the magnificent grounds we see something new. New blossoms, birds, roses and trees to name but a few.Yesterday we took the 45 minute tram tour of the 127 acres and the tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable and we thoroughly enjoyed it.The venue is suitable for all ages and there is so much to see and do. We spotted three brides and grooms yesterday with their photographers taking wedding photographs. The gardens and lake providing the perfect back drop.If you have not visited the Arboretum I recommend you do soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Georgiela
50,A beautiful walk,"If you enjoy exploring gardens of both familiar and strange vegetation, this is the place! There are literally miles of paths through a collection of trees, shrubs, flowers, and other living things to fascinate you. There is a tree that seems to occupy most of an acre, with wonderful foliage and branches for sitting. There are herb gardens that will tell you how to treat what's wrong with you. There are waterfalls and lakes, historic structures, like the Queen Anne cottage, If you want an education in Southern California Botanical gardens, this is the place for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonaldYokum
50,Great place,We loved it! Most beautiful garden! Hopefully we can comeback soon :). It's a very large garden so there is a lot to see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JunglePanther
50,This is a gem,What a fun place to visit and enjoy the beauty of Southern California! The gardens and grounds are simply stunning. In particular our family enjoyed the prehistoric jungle! The peacocks are a hoot too! They are everywhere and are both beautiful and noisy! Bring a camera and a picnic. There are shaded picnic tables near the entrance and a very nice cafe inside the gardens. Easy to spend 2-3 hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alicias655
50,Even in winter a respite,"Advertised as a place where even locals come to decompress, the Arboretum is s wonderful place to wander or briskly walk for exercise. A bonus are the landscapes and gardens you can explore along the way. Lots of Australian trees live here because the climate is similar enough for their survival. Watch out for traffic jams - there is a race track right across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKT0707
50,Spring and early summer is magical here,"Brushing aside a flock of peacocks and peahens you get to see one of the great treasures of Los Angeles. It even has a ""corpse flower"" that blooms every year and can be smelled from blocks away. Kidding aside, its really a delightful place to stroll and enjoy nature at its best. In the summer pack plenty of drinking water as it does get hot here in the SGV. Go early in the day to avoid the heat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frazgo
50,Historic Arboretum Tour,I am always amazed by the beauty of the Arboretum...a real gem located 137 acres in an urban area. Of course the tour is full of interesting details about Lucky Baldwin and our local history. I highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamePeg
50,A wonderful and informative tour,"We visited the Arboretum on August 8,2015, and this walking tour was a highlight of our visit. Our guide Sharon was very knowledgeable about the Arboretum, the history of the Arcadia area, and Lucky Baldwin's colorful career. We were able to go inside the Queen Anne Cottage (not available with general admission to the Arboretum). We also saw the lake, Coach Barn and the rose garden and Sharon provided background information on each that we wouldn't have had just wandering on our own. We highly recommend this tour for garden, historical home and history enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgsinger
