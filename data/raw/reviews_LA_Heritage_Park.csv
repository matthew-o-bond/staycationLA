50,A nice spot to visit,This is a park complex right near where I used to work. There are rooms and annexes that can be rented and we've had some creative meetings in the park complex. It's a really nice place to have lunch.,JRVogel100
50,Heritage of Aloha Festival @ Heritage Park Santa Fe Springs,"This was my first time here at the Heritage of Aloha Festival (HOA) in Santa Fe Springs. Like a dummy I went to the Heritage Park in Cerritos and was wondering where are the booths? Oh maybe we're early for cuz there in Hawaiian time?? Well we finally got to the right park in time to see plenty of vendor booths with all kine arts n crafts, food, clothing and free entertainment!Parking is free is you can find a good spot or don't mind a walk. Weather was nice today not too warm. The festival is free to enter! So the first thing we did was hit the food court and grab a Teri chix plate w side of egg rolls and a fresh Manapua! Food was awesome hats off to the cooks and all who prepare that's a lot of work! After a stroll around the booths my wife bought a flower print purse thingy and I got a T-shirt for 7 bucks!! While you wait from a booth called Red eye media.We watched some hula dancing from various groups around the southland. So cute to see to the little ones dancing! After that we headed back to the food court for more food to go this time some Lau Lau and more teri chix!!All in all I had a great time here. Good atmosphere, great food plenty parking. Tip: if you want a good spot to watch the dancing get there early and reserve a spot!Aloha!",David O
50,An oasis in an industrial area,"Beautiful parkland, a delightful aviary, and authentic recreation of a native American dwelling among other things. The only sad thing is that there are no photos of the big house that had been on the property before it burned in the 1940s (and where did the family live then). A wonderful place to walk your dog, or sit an quietly reflect.",Pauline K
50,Great Place for Families and Kids!,"This cute little neighborhood park has something for everyone.

50,Stroll into the past,This place is not too far from my job. When you have a chance I stop by here and take a small walk. Lets you know the beginnings of Santa Fe Springs in the area. This is a nice place for a wedding or any venue that you want to have very spacious and a lot of parking,jbamf21
50,"Historical park, very pretty and serene setting. Perfect for Quincenera photos or weddings. There's a life size train.","Perfect place to take your kids, especially if they're into trains. You can even have a Caboose party there. There's a Carriage Barn to go in and see items from a different era. You need to get a photo session permits to take photos there; however, totally worth it when you see your photos. Rangers oversee your photo session to make sure you have a private experience. There's water features there as well as a conservatory (greenhouse). They offer an outdoor wedding ceremony & reception package. Photos will come out gorgeous due to the surrounding. Well kept. New bathrooms too. There's a caf√© there to eat lunch at. It's gorgeous around Christmas time, very well decorated. They have the Aloha festival there in May (3rd Saturday, I believe). Early December, you can join in on the Las Posadas event and entertainment. Santa visit during Las Posadas, as well as Mariachi and dancers. Children's Day is typically celebrated in April.",anhwood
50,Best Time One Can Have At A Historical Site/Park,"Please head over with as many children, grandchildren, teens---you name it---who need to discover what life was like in the early 1900's. At first, you may think you are lost as industrial parks surround Heritage but once you experience what is unique about the entire site, you'll likely scratch your head in wonderment. How can a historical period be preserved, recreated and maintained so perfectly? (There is even a snack bar with hot and cold foods on the premises plus a wide variety of freshly made beverages. Mexican cuisine is the main style with the largest serving of nachos to be found almost anywhere. You'll need to walk off your tasty meal afterwards or if you bring in your own lunch, pick up the pace by circling the grounds a few time.) The ranger's office is at the front gated entrance so feel free to ask questions before starting out. If the trained volunteers are available to open the huge preserved carriage house, you will see a mini museum, gift shop and a few special unearthed treasures. Before you leave, head over to the mock up train station with an 80 ton vintage stream engine you'll want to climb/explore plus a few beautifully painted box cars. There is even a sweet rose garden planted to brighten up one of the corners near the dual set of tracks. Come on the weekend and you may see a wedding take place, a family reunion on the grounds or the many squirrels ""stealing"" the spilled seeds outside the aviary.",Rose H
50,Beautiful park,This is a beautiful park to explore and relax. There are a lot of historical artifacts. It is a great place for a picnic.,Angela W
40,There Is History In Santa Fe Springs,"The park is several acres of historic building, a train, and a recreated Tongva village. The ruins of the former ranch house sits about the center surrounded by a water tank, conservatory, aviary, carriage house, and smaller buildings. Intermixed are gardens and it is a popular place for local works to enjoy lunch. In a corner is a railroad exhibit including a locomotive, refrigerated car, and caboose along with a small station and other buildings and a rose garden. The Tongva village sits at a lower elevation behind thick vegetation making it feel more like it might have hundreds of years ago. Across the street is a sculpture garden leading off to a commercial development.The main park is open most of the day, but the Carriage Barn and Railroad Exhibit are open 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm., closed Monday and Friday and major holidays.",Kenneth L
