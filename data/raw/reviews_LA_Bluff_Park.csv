Sit on a bench and just enjoy the day, there might be people flying kites or flying model gliders in the wind.",BobandMargie G
50,Great for a dog walk!,"This place is great for a dog walk. We park by Ocean/Redondo and walk south, toward the dog beach, where we unhook the dogs and let them run. We usually walk to Bayshore (close to 1.5 miles), and then back up to the car. We walk past volleyball courts, Belmont Pier, all along the beach. There are restrooms along the way, and parking mostly up/down Ocean. Restaurants along the way include Chronic Tacos, Belmont Brewing, and many others, most of which are dog-friendly.",Michelle B
