50,Relaxing,"Loved that the park offered both sidewalks & nature trails so it truly has something for everyone. Very cute benches, historical plaques to read, picnic areas and fabulous views. Nice place for a walk/hike or to just relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briggsaltenbug
50,Excellent Spot for a sunset over the mountains,Stopped here on whim because we knew the sun would be setting shortly. Glad we did. Grounds are very nicely kept. Bathrooms were clean. Nice concrete path to follow. Or take the dirt trails through the hills. We followed the path around towards the edge of the cliff and walked down to a number of concrete picnic tables to watch the sun set. There park itself was fairly quiet with only a handful of visitors. A few hikers passed through. Excellent views of Pepperdine. The sunset does eventually get blocked out by the hills but the view was still gorgeous. Parking was free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCMommy

The sports fields have organized sports. Enjoy City public events and even in the parking lot, an exotic car show and coffee on some Sundays-",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
40,Open and accessible,"Other than during Little League season (when it's totally overrun), this is a pretty nice little park. The bathrooms could be a little cleaner (and easier to get to), and the play area definitely needs an update (that's in the works). The path that surrounds the park is great for the kids on bikes, although i wish it didn't loop back around to the parking area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma
50,A little nature with little effort,"Part of the charm of this park is that it is municipal, not state, so there is no admission or parking fees for this spot. Though it does not provide beach access, there are wonderful views, restrooms, athletic fields and playgrounds. It would be a fun place for a family with small kids or older adults to enjoy nature without a schlep down a path the actual shore. Worth a stop along the PCH to stretch your legs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanPok

30,"Interesting park, not sure of purpose","Surprise traffic was bad on PCH, so we pulled in to the park the stretch our legs and take i the scenery. I think the park caters to little league baseball, not there was not much else. Good rest spot. They have clean restrooms.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoseF98

40,A Jewel You Pass By When On Pacific Coast Hiway,"We had a family friend who had NEVER visited this area of the Cali coast before so I wanted her to get a GOOD impression of the area...Summer PCH is jammed with tourists...Along the Malibu pier area, forget it...Beaches can also be crowded but I know of this lovely place that serves up ocean views, plenty of green grass and a quick and easy egress to PCH...It is Malibu Bluffs Park...Actually used by locals as the Little League field for the community...Plus they have a small community center where kids can gather and folks can do their yoga...It is just across the highway from the lovely Pepperdine University on the hillside of Malibu...Benches, grass park area and rest rooms make this a nice place to stop and experience the beauty of the Pacific Ocean without the tourist hassle...Pull in next time you are by...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artieb701
