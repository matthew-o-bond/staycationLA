50,Happy Westlake Swingers!,"Enjoy the wonderful openness of Westlake Golf Course. Us locals love the course, services and pleasant enjoyment of this golf course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreatMobi
40,Fun golf course!,"This a short, but lots of fun18 hole course. A very well designed Par 67. Only 2 par 5's. Many Par 3's and many holes that are easy to reach in 2. Course is pretty wide open. A few water holes, but easy to reach over them. Our 18 hole round only took 3 hours. Pace was great. Fairways in very good condition and so were the greens. A fun and inexpensive golf course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/berniek1949
10,Under (dis)repair,"It is a fun course, but not being maintained. The greens are full of ball marks, no divot repairs (and no sand and seed for the carts), but the biggest problem is the coots and the geese. The whole course is a mess - even the greens. I really object to having to move the ball to even attempt to get around the mess without having to pick up bird droppings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4864ZKronc
50,Great friendly driving range,"I burned out the kids on amusement parks during spring break so instead of hitting Six Flags we came down to Westlake and hit a bucket of balls. Staff at the desk were great, loaned us some clubs and we whacked away, everyone had a great time and from the looks of it, the course was in nice shape too. I'm bringing my clubs next time and play a round.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonf104
30,My Local Executive Golf Course,"Westlake Golf Course is my local executive course. I am a once-a-month golfer and this course is perfect for those who do not want to be over-challenged! The prices are fair, the course is decent; however, there are many, many ducks and other birds on the course, making it rather messy at certain times of the year. What makes this course so great, is that you have great restaurants in walking distant from the course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179eileena
30,Needs work,"I know it is Winter, and local Winter rules apply, but the course was in bad shape today. Goundskeepers just blowing leaves around made it hard to find balls even in fairways regardless if using white or yellow balls (2 of us in foursome used white, 2 yellow). Fees are low and staff always friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H4864ZKronc
40,Bluesun fest,"I give it a good rating considering it was their first. Definitely need starwaggons, or more porta potties for next year. More bars , and more food trucks! Entertainment was great! And quick changeup was good, sound was excellent. Need better line movement and more entrances, and let people bring in bottled, sealed water. Barones should of had way more food in site...but, did their best. Tagging a charity into event would justify 10 dollar beer and wine prices also. Overall not bad, but definitely a learning curve.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6halleh
40,Nice little course & friendly atmosphere,Short municipal course that will test your short game. Desk staff are friendly and will try to accommodate walk-ons as best they can. Pretty hot summer (usually all are) but greens and fairways are well maintained. Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sterph1
50,Great Muni,Westlake Golf Course is a traditional executive length track. For a muni it is very well maintained. The people that work in the golf shop are friendly and helpful. The teaching staff is exceptional. I've taken lessons from Ted Lehman here for a couple of years and have taken lessons from many other teaching professionals elsewhere. Ted is the only one who has really helped me. I wish I had found him earlier. One great thing about the driving range: the balls are always in great shape and fairly new. The course itself is not resort or country club level but is great for beginners and intermediates.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stevebo88
50,Nice course,Staying at the Westlake Village Inn which is open to the golf course. Guys in the bridal party and a couple women decided to talk the short walk with clubs to the driving range at 9 pm. Bought a few buckets of balls and had a great time. The guys played 9 holes in the morning and seemed to enjoy the course. They had lunch there too and said it was nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalifSue
40,"Nice course, cheaper than others in the area","This course is very nice, several nice lakes, some nice long fairways, some short more technical holes, lots of trees and lots of ducks and geese. You can walk the course or rent a golf cart. They also have a nice driving range. They have a bar and indoor snack bar. Nice golf store and a good group of instructors if so desired. I've been there when it is real busy and other days when you have the course to yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,Chris Vatcher was born to teach golf!!!,If you are thinking of taking up golf or want to improve your golf game I highly recommend Chris Vatcher. She is best golf teacher hands down!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/283debbieg
40,"Easy shorter course, nice outdoor driving range.","This course is a fun one, because you feel like a pro. The par 4s are usually in the 325 yard range. Very well maintained, however, lots of ducks and geese...... they lots of ""gifts"" on the grounds.Driving range is terrific and open till 9 or 10 at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelmF120SB
20,Executive course,"If you are a player, this place is not for you. Better to go to Rustic Canyon, Moorpark CC, Sterling Hills, Los Robles, River Ridge or the like. This course is best for beginners or better players that want to work on their short game. Can play slow. Range is pretty good with an ok chipping area. I regularly practice there but rarely play for the reasons stated. Executive short course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradS314
30,Great smaller track,Fun course plays shorter than most with great playing greens.Water in play and plent of wildlife. Wonderful staff and groundskeepers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459jamesp459
50,Friendly bargain!,"We only had time to use the driving range ... and had to borrow some clubs to even do that. The staff was very helpful and the cost of a fairly large bucket of balls was only $9. Clubs were free! Looks like a fine course, but that will have to wait for our next trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TomLaw
30,Short course with nice driving range,"The course was well mainatined and next to the hotel we were staying in. Total length was about 5,700 years with most holes being flat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CU4NO
40,Great Place To Practice With Drivers & Woods,"If you are a beginner or a relatively recent convert to golf like me and wish to practice with your drivers and woods, I recommend you try this golf course. It was intimidating the first time but as I kept coming back, it got better and has given me confidence to try other more challenging fairways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DIyengar
50,NICE and CONVENIENT,"rented clubs.... drive a bucket..... had a good time.....covenient, cost effective, easy and clean!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/p-mshires
30,Soup & Sandwich or Burger,OK after the 9th or 18th hole. Certainly not a destination cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DickH84
20,Flat straight and boring,There are better choices if you really enjoy golf. This is a glorified par three course.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foosh9
30,Modest golf course,"It has been a while since I played her but it is always busy when I drive by! It's certainly not 5 star but for a quick, casual round, it's great! Be ready to wait but it's a short course and fast otherwise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LauraJ48
50,What a Sunday treat....,This is a great lunch spot with quiet babbling brook and ducks on the lawn. Very upscale but not stuck up. Good service and full bar. Sunday brunch is a real treat with what seems like a never ending tables of wonderful food. Forget about eating inside get a table outside its worth the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SquireDude
40,Good course for par 3,I have lived in the area for 30+ years and although this course is shorter with only a few par 5's it is usually enjoyable. Senior Rates all day on Tuesdays at $19 to walk not bad. Employees are very friendly and course manager Chris is a great guy very informed. Great kids program for golf. Sometimes slow play gets frustrating as this course gets a lot of play. Good driving range lit at night. Good course for women golfers. The water hazards pose a good challenge. Sometimes lots of leaves in the Fall can make it tough to find your ball as not always cleared away (use orange or yellow balls to find them). Totally disagree with other review on course employees as they are very friendly and informed. That person must have had a bad day....,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skisbabe
50,Very nice,I am used to golfing at very high end golf courses. I golfed as part of a 8 person wedding party and we all had a blast. We had to rent clubs and they were nice Top Flite clubs that the placed had cleaned up really well. The counter guys were hilarious. The course wasn't the best but it was pretty well... I expected far worse from other reviews I read. we play 18 in about 3.5 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mwwings07
20,The Need New Employees,"The Employees are so egnorent they feel they are above all just because they live/work on the nice part of town.very bad attitudes.The Golf Course is nice not very well kept but its good for beginners. very slow play you gotta wait it wasnt bad for my 4some cause we dont shoot far so we couldnt hit anybody, even if we wanted to.Don't play here you can find a better course in the same price range wit better staff and an overall better course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shaggy11
