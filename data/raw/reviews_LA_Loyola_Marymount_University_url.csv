50,US Trip,"Early morning walk. Great view over whole LA, including fabulous Hollywood sign. Really nice area here with many walking trials options. But you need to be prepared for it, bring enough water and proper cloths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilanSka
50,Nicely design campus,Stop on the parking by the Sacred Heart Chapel ( left side ) for the great views on Los Angeles. You can see even ocean from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
50,Beautiful University,"This was our first visit to LMU as part of the daughter’s college tour plan. There were around 6200 students enrolled.The university was located in LA on hill with nice views towards the Pacific Ocean, Hollywood sign and the city (if not for the smog). To find the bluff with the views head towards the upper classman dorms.The campus was spread out but told it only takes about 15-20 minutes to walk from one side of campus to another. Campus was nicely landscaped and quite busy the day of our tour. The Seaver College of Science and Engineering was a new life science building that incorporated lots of modern and energy saving features. A garden was laid out along the sloping roofline that extended from the ground. Other unique sites included a former airplane hangar acquired from Howard Hughes and converted into classrooms in University Hall. The largest piece of the Berlin Wall “west of the Mississippi” was located by the Malone Student Center.The dorms were grouped together on different ends of the campus. The laundry facilities and a cafe was located in the center of the dorm complex. The main dining facility was in the center of campus.The church was a beautiful site to visit with lots of stained glass windows. It was popular for alumni weddings.LMU is also one of a number of catholic universities run by the Jesuit order.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA
50,Mens' Basketball game,Fun venue. Went to game Saturday vs. Pepperdine. Free parking; reasonably priced tickets. Not too difficult to find off the 405 in West Los Angeles. Lots of places to try near the campus.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk
50,"Incredibly beautiful location, wonderful people, great university","My daughter fell in love with this place, 2 years before the end of high school, This week we are moving here in, class of 2022! Cannot believe the class of this place. Well run and very friendly overall. I hope it works for her, and part of me is wishing it was me who had been so lucky to find my way here to college (30 years ago) and not her now!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CTPreview
50,Absolutely Beautiful Campus,LMU has a stunningly beautiful campus that is truly worth the visit if you are ever in Westchester. We attended a vice nice mass on Sunday in the chapel which is open to the public every Sunday morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D_W_10017
40,Beautiful campus,We visited this lovely campus with friends who used to teach here. The grounds are beautiful especially the green spaces and landscaping. The church on campus was open and we went in to look around. It was plain but full of history. Some incredible views of LA from the look out point behind the church.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
20,This is not an attraction...,"...but a place to stay. The university is renting out their students apartments during term breaks. Rates ore ok when you need space or you´re travelling with children, service is friendly but unprofessional, manned by students without any training in the hospitality industry. The apartments are reasonably clean and large but lack any equipment..the kitchen has just the cabinets, an oven, a fridge and a microwave, no pots, pans, cutlery, crockery, no nothing. When we first moved in to our two bed apartment, there was wifi only in the bathroom, upon complaining we were told, there is no other apartment ready for occupation. Mind you, they have a couple hundred apartments and only a few were taken, however, none of the vacant ones were apparently cleaned and something could only be sorted after the weekend...shows how unprofessional the whole place is run...lots of rooms to rent but none ready. Anyhow, the next morning we found there to be no hot water and were told, the water had to run for 15 minutes before it would turn hot...well, it didn´t, it would only get lukewarm, even after 20 minutes. Imagine to wait for 15 minutes every time you want to wash your hands, the waste of water quite aside. We asked to be checked out (had booked for a week) since the absence of hot water was not acceptable and a potential health hazard (legionella bacteria loves to breed in lukewarm water). Suddenly a three bed apartment became available with working wifi and reasonably hot water, we moved our stuff and stayed for the rest of the week. The university itself has a very pretty setting atop a hill overlooking the bay and the grounds are well kept. First impression was somewhat weird since security at the main gate had never heard about apartments being rented out short term and turned us away. We were told to go to the side gate, where the guard enquired about us staying there and apparently was given the go ahead. Drove up to reception, were allocated our apartment and given some directions on how to find ti. However, the complex has several hundred apartments as mentioned before and there is no signage, so even when we found our building, it took twenty minutes to find the actual place. The staff can´t give you proper directions since they don´t know themselves where the different apartments are located within the buildings. Parking is $ 10,-/day which is not a big thing but it is not mentioned anywhere before your arrival. Overall I would say it is a pity that the place i not using it´s potential. Properly run, it would be perfect for families or anybody looking for a bit of space at a reasonable price around LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrFerdinandMaus
50,35th Annual Wine Classic,We attended the 35th annual wine classic and had a blast trying the wine from over 40 wineries in one room. This is a fundraiser event for the school and the tickets range from $90-$115 depending on when you purchase your tickets. The price may seem steep for some but in actuality if you go to these wineries you will pay anywhere from $20-$75 and above tasting fee. It's best to narrow down your options prior to arrival or else you can easily get overwhelmed and possibly drunk too. The appetizers and desserts are delectable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vegout2
10,BAD DORMS,I am here for a week on holiday and since the first minute I am looking forward the day I'll leave. Beds are uncomfortable and towels worse than in a prison. It's like beeing in a camping. restroom shared with the rest of the floor!!! rules are too strict especially for teenagers that shuold enjoy their time together. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARTEMISHERE
40,College visit,It's a really nice campus with some interesting history. The old church is very nice and the bluff is really cool to look down from across all of LA. This property has to be worth a fortune,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LostALot22
