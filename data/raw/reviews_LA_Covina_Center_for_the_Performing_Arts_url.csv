50,Love it so much I keep going back!,Mostly tribute bands now but they are all superb. Great entertainment for a couple of hours for not much money. Only 99 seats so you cannot get a bad one. Bar upstairs!,caltravelgal
50,Tribute Programs,"This weekend I went to see Mirage: Tribute to Fleetwood Mac:::: This is the second Tribute I've seen there this year. Great entertainment, reasonable pricing, easy to get tickets online and small comfortable theatre. Just booked tickets for Rod Stewart Tribute. Can't beat it for a nice night our.",574Gerri
40,Local live theater,"This local amateur theater company has been active for years, moving from West Covina to Covina 20 years ago, into the very old cinema that was on the verge of collapse. The group puts together an excellent program. This is a fun and different thing to do for an extra special night on the town.",shanghaijones
