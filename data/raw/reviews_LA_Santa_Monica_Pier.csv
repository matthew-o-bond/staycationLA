50,Great For a Stroll,"We walked from Third Street Promenade to Santa Monica Pier and we had a wonderful time. Gorgeous views, good eats, and a nice little amusement park. I'd recommend going at sunset for the scenery and so that everything starts to light up.",Amy
50,Exciting,"On the west of LA, this is a nice attraction for tourists and local people. It is located on Ocean avenue and facing the Pacific ocean. The pier has many attractions for the visitors including amusement parks, restaurants & cafes, souvenir shops and areas for fishing. You can easily spend hours there and have excellent views of the ocean & beaches.",cp_0010
30,Tired and need of update,"Like much of LA, full of homeless and people with issues. Tired attractions. Only thing worth it was some ice cream shops and the Route 66 shop. But this is at least safer than Venice Beach - now that is a dump. Never going again.",sparky59canberra
50,CoronaTherapy,"Although the beach had only recently been reopened, there were quite a few people enjoying the weather. Strolling under the boardwalk and splashing in the waves was much-needed therapy.",Kev
50,Tourism,Loved the walk by the pier. Great place to spend the evening. Serene beautiful no words to describe . Love the place,shetty782019
20,Waste of time,It's just appear at a public beach what's the typical way too expensive crappy restaurant at the end. It has a few carnival-type rides the Entertainer kids that aren't interested in seeing the natural beauty surrounding them. Stop by once to say you were there and then get out. Walk along the beach where it's enjoyable,Old Pro
50,Fun place to go,"Pretty obvious, when in Santa Monica you have to visit the pier. It's full of great little shops, street performers and amazing views over the ocean and beachfront.We visited here with the intention of spending the afternoon in Santa Moncia and walked here from Venice.The pier was very busy and bustling and you are spoilt for choice if you want some Santa Monica merchandise.When we visited the Aquarium and some of the outdoor restaurants were closed do the fires which you could see in the distance and the hills but it didn't take away from a great afternoon over the water.There is a mini theme park on this pier which, unless you but wrist bands or cards you will pay an arm and a leg to visit. the rides for individuals are expensive so takee that into account when planning your spending money here.",Christopher
40,"Love the pier, touristy","Fun to walk around, see the nice view. Very touristy, only touristy shops on the pier, but a must see for visitors.",eostrows
50,"Nice pier, expensive parking",This pier is full of people any time of the year or any time of the day. But you will enjoy the vibe and the atmosphere near the beach with people doing random things on the street. You can find pretty good restaurants with good enough food. Buba shrimp is a favourite. Listen to random music by random street musicians. Breathtaking view of the sunset and the nice breeze of the ocean. Parking Charges are sky high!,George
40,Fun on the Pier,"Each time we are in the area we head to Santa Monica Pier. We have visited both day and night and love both. The kids like the amusement park area and mum and dad like just strolling along people watching and browsing the stores and buskers. Always stop and have a meal at Bubba Gumps and walk to the end of the pier. You can access the beach and under the pier from just next to Bubba Gumps. Nighttime is the better atmosphere due to the lights. While visiting the area check out the next two blocks up from the pier and along the beach strip for great restuarants, bars and shopping. We have spotted a few celebs in the area also. Great place for everyone with something for all ages. The entry to the Pier is free and you can buy a wristband for rides. If open, check out the old carosel.",ROAD TRIP GYPSY
30,Fun boardwalk,Fun little walk around the infamous pier. Ample parking nearby. Lots of homeless people though as with a lot of this area but they weren’t really bothering anyone.,Claire M
50,A fun place to walk!,"We really enjoyed several walks along the pier, particularly in the evening at sunset. Really atmospheric and great fun!",Tauntonholidayers

50,Fantastic experience,"We visited the world famous Santa Monica Pier last week and it was an amazing. There’s lots to do including the Zolten machines, arcades, amusements, Street entertainers and Ferris wheel. It was bustling with people. Highly recommended.",Clarkie
50,A dream,"Wide beaches, super calming away from the pier. Lots of interesting sights on the pier like hotdog stands and buskers. Definitely a must-see.",Alicia
40,A trip back in time,"I've seen this on TV but great to see in person. The wooden pier is all a pier should be. Lots of entertainment with Superman on your way onto the pier, Musicians and singers, magician, and the opportunity to have your name on a piece of rice, have your photograph taken eating outlets, coffee shops an opportunity to fish and all that without mentioning the big wheel, roller coaster and other rides. When we were there it was sunny and it was great just to sit along the pier and people watch on the beach and the promenade.The one area the pier could better is the providing a safer passage along the pier as the sleepers are uneven and you could trip!",HughMc
50,Iconic and breezy,"The SM Pier is what's left of a bygone era that included ""Pacific Ocean Park"". Even if you aren't interested in dining or riding the awesome carousel, or even shopping, the stroll down to the end where people still fish is worth it.",Kathleen M
50,Exactly what you expect from a Pier,"This pier was great and exactly what I expected to get from a pier. Great atmosphere for all ages!!!! The rides were reasonable priced, as were the games. They offered every ""carnival"" type of food you would want to see, along with more than a few options for sit in eating. Pleasantly surprised.",Kristina
50,Fun nostalgia,"My wife and i had never been, but of course saw it in movies or on tv. Mid week during the coronavirus scare meant lines were short and crowds were manageable. We just walked to the end and road the ferris wheel and rollercoaster both enjoyable. The weather had been stupid rainy the whole drive down... then... perfect 65 and sunny. Gotta checkout at least once.",Geoffrey B
30,Meh....Its not bad,"Well the area is cool, the pier is a bit crowded. Its a carnival on the beach. Very touristy with many street vendors, selling food and singing. Not the place to go if your'er looking for piece and quiet. The pier does look cool at night as the rides are illuminated.",Clarence McMurray
30,A bit run down,The pier needs a bit of TLC but it nice for a saunter. There are is an amusement arcade and some stalls but not a great deal of interest.,Garthess
50,Fantastic,Loved this place. Was very busy but was relaxing at the same time. We went on the carousel which was great fun,Val M
40,Carnival atmosphere,"If you like carnivals, you'll like the Santa Monica Pier. Parking can be a problem - bring lots of quarters. Some of the musicians were quite good.",1Wisetraveller
50,Great place to visit,"Only in LA for a couple of days. First day we went it was cold and rainy, but still had fun, also went around the area, shops etc. Eat at the Cheesecake Factory for our evening meal. Lively area, one of the best places to visit in LA. Went back on our last day before we flew home as it was 80% and wanted to see ot in the sunshine, brilliant",Tinkerbell1105
40,Lively and fun,"We made a quick stop on our way to L.A. and walked the length of the pier. There are rides, vendors selling all types of souvenirs, buskers playing music and singing. There's also many places to eat. Lots of great photo opportunities and a beautiful beach for kiddies to play on! It's a fun, lively place to spend a few hours.",148sandrac148
10,Don’t recommend,Paid $20 to park and waited forever to get a spot and the pier is crowded and smells terrible not a fan at all.,Lisasinpa
50,Love this funky alive pier,"I think one of my favorite LA places. Very funky. Skillo, ticky tacky, dancers, jugglers, singers, musicians, ferry’s wheel, carousel. Great for people watching. Go, go!! Great Mexican restaurant there on the pier!",AuntTink
50,Fun night,It's worth paying for the unlimited rides here as you get your value after a couple of rides. A fun night out.,agt96
40,A nice visit on a January morning,"We had a day to use when we suddenly decided not to go to Universal Studios, so went to the Pier as part of our fill the day plans. We had a nice couple of hours here, with good weather. We parked on the pier itself for a moderate fee. There were a few performers doing their things out on the pier though the only one I paid much attention to was the ukelele player, who played a tune at my request. Had a light lunch at the restaurant on the pier. The souvenir places were what you might expect and we found a few things for the family back home. I walked out on the sand and even went under the pier and out the other side. I half expected there to be shady characters down there but it was fine, and I felt safe walking through there. All in all a nice visit and glad we did it. Some say it is overrated but I dont have anything to compare, and thought it was just fine.",William W
20,"Been here, Done that..that’s it..","For me as a solo tourist, it was just an okay experience of walking around the Santa Monica Pier.. Been here and done that kind of experience for me...",Kenny LWT
50,Memorable stroll along Santa Monica pier and beach,"We definitely enjoyed our stroll along Sabra Monica pier and beach on a sunny March weekday. It’s definitely more of a touristic area, but it’s still a nice place to visit. There were some nice shops, but we were more interested in the beach. Not much of a crowd, so we took our time taking pics and walking along the cold water.It’s worth the visit if you’re visiting LA.",Alexis B
30,Overrated,"We had never been to the Santa Monica Pier so while in Newport, we decided to check it out. It was not something I would need to do again. It is just a small carnival. Nothing special. People watching was interesting.",845LisaV
50,Sister trep,"The pier is like the pictures, the Ferris wheel and end of Route 66. A fun place to visit and say you have been there!",Merrie Jo A
50,Fun stop!,"Very enjoyable but crowded. We went at night and getting into the area was super busy, but that goes with this area. Parking was super packed and hard to manuever around the lot and exit area.",Jeff
30,Not great,"Contrary to what I’ve see. On tv and movies, the place was dead!!!! It’s good to go check it out and that’s it.",world_travellers15
30,Didn't stay long,We drove here from Disneyland because we wanted to see the ocean and this pier. It's cool that you can drive on the pier and park.It was just a walk to the end and back to the car. It seemed pretty dirty and a lot of homeless hanging out begging.There was some neat entertainment but overall unimpressive. One and done,jmcn80
40,Entertaining,"A bit like Blackpool some tat to buy, plenty of entertainment from street artist musicians and magicians.Good fun to watch",Phil B

40,Get it on a good day,"Our first day in LA we spent it walking along Venice Beach all the way down to Santa Monica Pier. The sun was splitting the stones, muscle beach was full athletes working out, street music was playing and the place was full of life.Spent most of the afternoon on the pier after losing a small fortune in the arcade!Sitting down and having a cocktail while watching out into the ocean was just incredible.Didn’t have kids with us so we didn’t use the rides/attractions but it was really busy so I would take that as a sign they’re good? A spot not to be missed but bring a bottle of water with you if walking the beach .",citytravels18
30,Nice Sunday afternoon,"Nice Sunday afternoon walk. Was my first time in the Pacific Ocean. the weather was chill still but many were on the water. I did not play any of the game because I am not a fanatic but many kids were having fun. Mexican are everywhere selling mango with lemon and salt my fave fruit, I couldn't get enough. A lot of family having fun.",Yenyok
30,Lively,"Very busy but it was Presidents day, as a group of students with a huge banner let us all know.Nice old wooden pier with a fair gound addition, lots of outlets, food and tat, its easy to forget you are even on a pier. Good view of the beaches either side from the end. Have to walk off the pier really if you want a snap of the pier sign$7 to park car.",Gardengel-IoW
30,For the Tourist,Pier is mostly a one and done type of visit. Enjoyed some of the entertainment on the our and the views of the water. We even saw a seal! The pier itself is pretty small and overall very congested. Also there is a pretty decent number of homeless people within the area. I hope the city finds a way to help them!,Kelly F
40,GTA V Vibes,"As many may know, the Santa Monica Pier is not only an entertaining and picturesque location, but also replicated in GTA V, probably for the reasons that I just listed. I enjoyed my visit to the Pier as it was cool to experience the location in real life and the atmosphere and activities were exciting. We didn't buy anything or ride the rollercoaster, but the views and music were worth it and we found a spot to sit down and take a break. Like the Venice Canals (see my other reviews) this is a staple of LA and should and could be visited at the same time as a trip to Venice.",Michael
30,We can say we’ve been...,"Loved Santa Monica, not so much the Pier, it’s on the list of once is enough experiences. Typical tourist trap, go and experience it, but don’t plan on staying long.",Katie R
30,Good for the view but pretty ordinary,"Whilst you’re in LA there’s a few places you’ve got on your list and this is always one of them, but to be honest it’s not that fantastic. You’ll take your iconic shots and maybe ride the Ferris wheel and a walk down the pier but that’s about it. Lol the most fun thing we saw though was a Mexican man playing his guitar with a trump mask on-hilarious, and the musician was really good. Ferris wheel isnt cheap, you’d get better value if you wanted to do more rides and games there but we weren’t that interested. We had a five year old, 11 year old and 16 year old. The promenade and restaurants around the place are good, so if you visit explore the surrounding area too.",Vanessa M
50,A charming place to spend an afternoon,I love the charm and ambient of the Santa Monica Pier. It’s a great place to go for a stroll for fresh air or to just look at the ocean. Try to go their before Sunset to catch some amazing views.,Ahmed K
50,Absolutely stunning,Santa Monica pier was great fun and absolutely beautiful. Locals told us it's even better at night but we didn't get to experience it all lit up. There is plenty to see and so and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Highly recommend.,Attorney Day
50,GREAT PIER PLENTY FOR THE FAMILY TO DO,"What a lovely place for a walk around , the Santa Monica Pier has plenty to do for all the family , bars , restaurants, arcade and the fair rides . The prices are very reasonable. The views are amazing , plenty to do .",myfamilylincs
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Went to Santa Monica Pier for a walk. Very busy and happening place, a lot of gift shops and a lot of visitors and tourists along the pier. There are a lot of good seafood restaurants on the pier as well. There is also a theme park on the pier where kids and adults both can have fun.",Wander & Wonder
50,Best Night!,"Although it was our first night, It was a perfect one because of the pier. I had the mango flower that reminded me of our trip to Mexico City. Walking the pier, enjoying the view/night, taking pictures and eating the carnival food was a perfect night. ❣️",Greys C
30,Fun People Watching,"It’s very touristy but also a great place to watch the sunset. You’ll see all types of people, so take a stroll and do some great people watching. If you’re there later in the day, be sure to stick around for the sunset!",ah64fish
40,An iconic structure featured in a number of films. Well worth a visit but.............,"This was a must see location for us as the Santa Monica Pier is iconic, appearing in a number of well known films. The various 'attractions' were pretty tacky but as one might expect from any similar amusement centre. Neverthe less glad we visited and thenn dipped our toes into a very cold Pacific Ocean!",Michael L
50,Very nice place for walking,Very nice place for walking. Weather is all year round perfect.Lots of shops and restaurants all over the place.,AmrAbdallah
50,Beautiful,"It was so great! We had a balast. There are so many shops for souvenirs. Although watch out for the hustlers when you try to go down the sidewalk. We had guys harassing us to buy their cd or make a donation. We told them no cash, but they have the square app! So we had to just keep moving on. There are talented people down by the pier though. We didnt go on the rides but you can pay for them individually if there's one you want to go on.",Marissa C
30,Another Pier,"If your in Santa Monica, it’s a pleasant walk out along the pier.Note there are 2 sides, one with the tatty Amusement Park, and then the right hand side, the long walk out to a building with a restaurant/ bar.It’s a good people watching venue which most non US visitors.",ScambusterSZ
50,A Blast from the Past,Loved it!!!!This adventure took me back to the small town where I grew up where every summer a street carnival would come to.town...Although the rides here are so much bigger and better than those from street carnivals the joyous feelings are the same.I would definitely do this again.,Aneva H
50,Nice view,Just took a walk from Venice to the pier. Great place to spot many interesting people :) It’s a nice walk.,Henrik A
10,I don't get the hype,"I only went there because it was the halfway point of my cross country and back road trip and the end of Route 66.I have traveled all throughout the country, except for the most northern states, and I'm just not fond of California.The pier is just a pier with restaurants, a few rides and a lot of very overpriced souvenir shops. I get that marijuana is legal for recreational use there, but if no one can smoke cigarettes on the pier, no one should be smoking joints either. I swear I ran into at least a half dozen people smoking joints while I went to the end and back. And then there was some guy dressed as a superhero trying to get in every picture I tried to take of the sign at the beginning of the pier. I just didn't like the whole experience.",296williamsg
40,Must visit!,I would recommend visiting this pier for the Beautiful sunset view.It also has an arcade place. There’s daily entertainment along the pier.If you’re visiting the Santa Monica area you need to pass by the pier.,Amna Kazim
40,Photo op location,"Great sea views, with a small outdoor theme park (Pacific Park, which looks old btw), huge beach (too cold though for beach activities and it doesn’t look very clean with the very many birds, seagulls flying around), little touristy cart stalls along the stretch of the pier, restaurants and many talented buskers from singing to dancing to drawing.Overall a small place and can be covered in less than an hour if you don't go into the theme park. Could have been even faster if not for the 2 Korean girls taking their time to take countless photos at the Route 66 sign keeping many others like me, rolling our eyes in queue.",dyhx
40,A nice stroll,A lovely stroll and necessary photo op. I stayed right by there so it was convenient. It really is just a short walk. Restaurants you would be better in and around Santa Monica for selection.,Evster
40,You don’t have to fish to enjoy the pier!,This was a fun afternoon! The fishing pier was very clean and the bathrooms were Very Clean. Kudos to the sweet lady on duty! Lots to do and see.,Aprilla
50,A Good Vibe for a Tourist Spot,"I am with a group of artists that go around L.A. and do plain aire paintings, and we spent the morning on the SM pier. Nice people and clean are what come to mind. Most of the people were out-of-towners looking at the beach and seagulls.",lynndds
40,Very interesting views and shows,This was one of my best ever spots to visit at early morning to enjoy the nice views of the ocean and watch the waves and the birds OR at night to watch the shows... the only bad thing was the smell of the weed smoke but some visitors.,Abdulla Shehada
40,Tourist must see,"This is just one of those places you have to go visit when travelling to LA! We went at night, rode the roller coaster just for the fun of it (10$ a person). It was a fun carnival type of vibe. We spent about an hour there. Sure it's very tourist-y, but a lot of places in California are. It was not overcrowded though, we got to experience it withouth being overwhelmed by too many people.",Milan C
40,Entrainment and so much more,Along the pier you will find entertainers doing their best however some of them to stick with their day jobs. We got some really good cinnamon rolls with our coffee and sat outside the cafe to watch the world going by along the pier. We walked to the end of the pier looking for Forest Gumps shoes but did not find them till we had given up. They were in the most obvious place right by the entrance to Bubba Gump's Shrimp restaurant. It was not too busy while we were there it was a Wednesday midday. The seagulls were busy trying to find food and people were coming and going all the time.This would be a suitable visit for people of all ages and abilities although the lower area at the end of the pier has steep steps. You could spend all day here if you wanted.,holiday-view23-7-11
50,MOVIE LOCATION PHOTOS! Beautiful sunsets!,"WE LOVE SANTA MONICA- its unique, a fabulous district for walking and shopping. For a nostalgic trip- this one is a must foe photos and memories of other times. The beaches are beautiful and at this time of year you catch the whales!",TRAVELLER2012
40,Great Place To Visit,"Very cool place to visit! From early morning until late in the evening, the views are astounding. There are a couple of sit down restaurants and a lot of grab and go food choices. It’s relaxed and the people are chill. The “amusement” park is pretty busy - rides are clean and the workers are nice. The beach is very clean. Can even walk along the ocean to Venice Beach and take in a whole different vibe.",CP1
30,Miss the Old Days,"Thousands of tourists and locals enjoy visiting the pier. There are shops, restaurants and rides. But, I miss the pier as it was 50 or 60 years ago when I visited it as a little kid. Lots of Southern California attractions have gotten bigger and more popular, but bigger is not always better.",Sundancer93003
50,Solo trip but awesome,"It was beautiful nice people, lots of scenery. Shops galore. Will visit again soon I hope. Tour guides available.",Katielgb
50,Pier,For a great view of the beach stand on the pier and away you goThe views are breath taking and well worth a trip if your in LA,Barrie G
50,One of must visit places in Los Angeles Country!,Santa Monica coast in itself is gorgeous. It is a dream place to live for most. The pier is enjoyable with its attractions and the coast walking/bicycle track for length of kms is a delight along with the shopping district.,AEGEAN_MERMAID
50,Very lively and buzzing,The pier is just so lively and buzzing. Lots of food and shopping options. We even saw a school band come and do a performance they must have just been practicing but it was wonderful to watch. Parking is $10 and is cash only. All in all a great place to spend some time and has something to do for everyone.,Priya V
40,Amazing sunset spot,"The Santa Monica Pier is a shiny spot to visit, but it's a one-timer really. It is fun, and loud, and crowded, there is food, and magnets, and souvenirs, but it is so full that finding a free table is almost impossible, especially during the weekends. However, the sunsets are spectacular, I don't think I've seen anything quite like it. It makes the whole hustle with the crowd worthwhile, once you get that perfect sunset spot.",Ellie
40,Beautiful place,"The view was spectacular and the pier was a nice place to visit. There were many shops and food vendors. It was crowded, but we had no problems.",Mattie J
40,Funny & pretty,This was fun & cute for me. Made me feel like a kid again lol. Go early enough to play & ride but late enough to see the sunset because it is beautiful!,Ally
30,Disappointed,We went for lunch hoping to find a nice seafood restaurant. Sorry but Bubba Gumps doesn’t count. The Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier serves a delicious fish taco so it wasn’t all bad. There are amusement park rides but we didn’t go on any. The one that stood out was a circus trapeze venue that were I younger I would have tried.,Watsson
30,Very crowded and touristy,"If you enjoy the relaxation of a hometown pier, then this is not for you. Loads of out-of-town visitors crowded this attraction when we were there making it totally not enjoyable. In fact we couldn't wait to turn around and get off the pier and away to our next destination.",Randy L
40,It's iconic,We haven't been here that often but we have a good time when we do go there. The ferris wheel is worth a visit all on its own.,Armen Pandola
50,Touring Santa Monica and Venice,"Going to Santa Monica Pier and Venice beach, is a wonderful experience. There you can be delighted by the relaxing lifestyle in the beach, you can admire several artistic expressions like paintings, handicrafts, an appropriate diversity of food and a friendly atmosphere. You can take a walk or rent an scooter or a bike to have a tour. You will enjoy that place",Miguel V
50,Can’t stop visiting it!,"Brilliant place. Fantastic views, and loads of things to see . Bit overpriced, but it is a must in Santa Monica.",Jordi-cr7
50,Sao Paolo to LA,"Great restaurants, lots of fun, and the ferris wheel rocks! This is a place to bring the family or just go on a date. There are boardwalk entertainers and you're just 10 minute walk from Venice Beach.",michaelg
40,"A good Pier, an OK beach - Not worth it in January.","The Beach was just OK and not that fun. The sand is sticky and sticks on your feet. The water is also not that great. Overall, not worth going in January, too windy and chilly. The rides on the pier seemed like fun.",polarbear559
40,Tips from a LOCAL for Santa Monica,"you can enjoy Santa Monica and avoid the crowds (unless PEEK summer). Best thing to do is wake up early. IF you want a view without the crazy crowds, drive further down Ocean heading North and park, walking along the bluffs. There is metered parking AND FREE parking on the residential streets NORTH of Montana. Also, you can take one of the pedestrian walks from there, over PCH down to the beach.Getting to the PIER first thing when it opens is the best time. Riding the ferris wheel offers a splendid view. Muscle beach is a fun place for all to play and it is free if you want to avoid the pier. It is on the beach directly south of the pier. Annenberg beach house also can be accessed via the pedestrian overpass and you can make a pool reservation, having access to one of Hollywoods legendary houses (former home of Marian Davies) a pool, the ocean, and a place to eat. This place is fun for all ages from toddler to great-grandparent. Parking at the house is limited so if you can walk, take the pedestrian over-pass. Right next to the PIER are two fairly inexpensive and local family spots. Bruno's Italian restaurant and the walk-through Hot Dog on a stick.For those wanting a work out and possible glimpse of some movie-stars, make your way to the Santa Monica Stairs off of Santa Monica canyon. Get your stair-climbing work out in with one of the best views, and then walk to the ocean to cool off or catch a game of volleyball.Finally, cheap eats around the area are not always easy but here are some locals enjoy:Bruno's, Gilbert's El Indio, Cha Cha Chicken, Rae's for breakfast, Bay Cities, Taco's Por Favor, Frito Misto, True Food, Shaka Shack, Ninjin Ramen, Rize Thai and Sushi, Wexler's Deli...Joe's PizzaIf you have a car, driving north to Malibu area is also fun, stopping at the Ahmanson House or the Malibu tide-pools. A trek up through one of the canyons can offer pretty hiking and a hint of local culture. Topanga canyon has Topanga Canyon state park, Hidden Treasures thrift shop for an eye-popping picture, and some hippy good time shopping options. If you hike in the canyon, try to make your way to Eagle rock. Again, getting to the parks early is key to avoiding the crowds.For those wanting less of a strenuous hike head towards",sinipah
40,Busy!,"Boy, was this place busy!We did a walk the full length of the pier, took in the views, ate funnel cake / ice cream and watched some of the street acts.It is great to say that you have been on SM pier - it has featured in so many TV shows & movies, but we were there for just under 2hrs (including sit down funnel cake eating time!), which is plenty long enough unless you want to go on the rides (we didn't - we'd been to 6Flags and were 'coastered out!).Worth a visit? Yes, absolutely. Would i go back? Probably not, it's very, very touristy",RichardN28
40,Enjoyable stroll,We had a pleasant stroll along the pier and enjoyed a seat at the end to watch the ocean and it’s waves for a while. Quite relaxing. Great views back across the beach at Santa Monica. There were a few places to eat and drink if wanted. A separate part of the pier houses the funfair.,RobDavis12
30,Touristy and Crowded,Walking to the end of the pier is nice for a good view of the beach. Some of the local entertainers are good. Just a heck of a lot of people and parking stinks. It is LA so you can drive 3 miles in 45 minutes.,traveloften028
50,Very touristic place but really nice,"Of course, it is very touristic place with many people but nice walk and Luna Park is enjoyable with perfect views from the wheel and other attractions.",julialux347
50,Sun and Ice Cream,The Santa Monica Peir was a wonderful way to soak up some January California Sun. Since there was no chair rentals on the beach the Peir was the next best thing. I was ableto enjoy the entertainment on the Peir and have a great hand dipped ice cream.,Stacey M
50,California Fun in the Sun,"My family and I loved this place. There is a feel here that is unique to California with the beautiful Pacific Ocean all around, the beach and beachgoers surfing, swimming, and tanning in the background, and all the sights and smells of an amusement park on an ocean pier. Great place to just walk through, take pictures, people-watch, souvenir shop, and grab a snack.Although it gets crowded, it is large enough to accommodate everyone, and it's a place where you can't help but to feel a sense of fun. Just being here, you get a sense of what attracts so many people to the west coast as you scan the surroundings and see the beautiful Pacific Coast.",Michael K

My girlfriend and I strolled to the end of the pier and read the fascinating history, then watched some of the buskers performing their crafts (the magician who pulls money out of a lemon was awesome!!), and then went on the Ferris wheel!!!! Definitely worth a visit to this iconic spot!!!!! Safe, family friendly, clean location.",Drsuedawson

50,Amazing place to explore!!,"Plenty to do at the pier and near the pier, if your touring the area no brainer to stop. We drove from Anaheim to the pier, depending on traffic expect to take 1.5-2.5 hours, we unfortunately fell into the more rush hours. But once your there, plenty of parking up from the pier by the mall, five minute walk, near the beach or on the pier. The mall up from the pier is huge with lots of interesting stores. Lots going on on and around the pier! Plenty of places to eat, shop, and find entertainment. Lots of performers and street type of food besides, burger, fish and chip, and a nice place at the end of the pier. The beach on a Tuesday wasn’t all that crowded, found a nice place to set up to play in the water.One note up from the pier a must stop if you like fries, The Great American Fries Co. trailer, simple and darn good fries. They have a few choices and lots of amazing dipping sauces. But the basic fries are hand cut potatoes and salt, that’s it, really good!You can spend 3-4 hours near the pier easy.",Wanderer0213
50,Great time,"Went on a Saturday night so we knew what we were getting in to. Extremely crowded but ride lines were reasonable. There were about 10 of them. You should purchase the ""all rides"" ticket. It's the most economical way to go. Plus the rides are excellent. The kids wanted to do several rides, several times. That Ferris wheel is the real deal. Park under the pier. Parking on the streets near impossible. Like I said we went on a Saturday night. There's a nice little aquarium under the pier worth visiting. The Word Famous Venice Beach Boardwalk about a half mile down the beach",Judpma012
40,Wonderful pier and energy!,"Simply put, the Santa Monica pier is a must visit while in the Los Angeles area. Local culture, dining, games and rides for kids. Beautiful view and the sea air. Do not need much more than that!",JskinnyG

20,Seen better days,"My kid's were excited to go so I took them there on our first stop from LAX. My husband and I used to live in LA and never bothered to go as it was a tourist spot, too busy with Rock n Roll on Sunset Strip but I digress. They were so excited and it was nice and quiet as it was Thursday morning. The Sun was shining and a slight breeze and we were off to the end of the pier stopping to see the different venders selling their over priced wears and the entertainers singing off key and slagging off the bums who were also begging for money. the arcade got $20 out of me and that was worth it for the smiles on the kids faces but there were flies everywhere.... GROSS. The rides were extortionate prices so my 2 girls got to choose 1 ride . They'd make buckets more dollars if they gave a better deal on the rides . Glad we did it just to say we did it but had just as much fun swinging on the free swings on the beach.",kaytraditionsjax

30,The walk over is nice for the view!,"They have a pedestrian bridge over to the pier- it’s a hill so part of the walk will be uphill! It’s a typical pier with fast food and small rides, lots of people. But you can get some nice views of the beach from here.",Vicki C

There were some very talented street performers. A handful of rides and shops, and plenty of chain restaurants to eat at. There was a band playing, and at the end of the pier a spot to take pictures with the ocean.

40,"Simple, visit for the view","The pier is beautiful and it is worth the visit for a great shots. The pictures turned out amazing, and we had a nice time there, despite the cold wind. There is kpt much to see or do during winter, some of the stores and restaurants were actually closed. Watch out for parking nearby and be careful if you park on Ocean Avenue, as the way down to the pier is very steep and may not be suitable if you have someone who needs accessible paths.",FaaabiCruz
40,A favorite place to stroll,"I always try to make it here for a walk when I’m in LA. A great place toExperience the ocean and beach of you don’t have the time, clothing, or weather for laying out in the sand. Great people watching and activities. I especially enjoy the arcade and watching people practice at the trapeze school.",Telfe
30,nothing special - if you're from a coastal area,"Living in New Jersey, I've been to a lot of beaches and boardwalks. To me, this was nothing special. In my entire trip to LA this was the one place where I felt unsafe, like I had to hold my bag and my phone a little tighter. Other than that, plenty of places to eat and drink, rides and games for the kids. The end of the pier is great for fishing. Definitely don't need a whole day for it. Worth seeing, but nothing special.",Angie

50,"Beautiful, but busy","We ended up here from January 1-3 and it was fantastic. It was a little cool by the pier because of the ocean winds. Very busy even with the cool breeze. Plenty of places to eat or you can walk away from the pier across the street for more options. Walked off the pier and walked on the sand, water is very cold. Great place for pictures and to see some of the coastline. Overall a great day here.",GREENLANTURN36
20,A bit disappointing,We visited Santa Monica Pier and boulevard but to be honest I have no idea what the hype is over. We stayed at Redondo beach and pier and it was so much quieter with fresh seafood markets.My advice is if you don’t have the time don’t waste it coming to a mini carnival on the beach,ShazChris
40,Great sunset and place to walk,"Just a couple of miles from Venice this place is very nice looking and has a great vibe whitin.Sunset here is amazing and you can get some nice fair food on the pier.

30,Santa Monica Pier,Beautiful views of the Pacific ocean from the beach and pier. Shops and eateries along the pier. There were a number of visitors along the pier from the various colleges that were attending the Rose parade and Rose bowl the next day. There a many vendors selling food. Nice place to walk and enjoy the beach area. if you are someone who enjoys rides there is a Ferris wheel overlooking the ocean.,Charmain D
30,Underwhelming and unremarkable,Schlepped all the way from LAX as had a stopover and wouldn't rush back. The pier is fine but there really is nothing special to warrant going out of your way to get here. If you are in the area then makes sense but that's about all the effort I would apply to see this spot.,Adam W

30,Overcrowded,We took forever to find a parking lot and only to stay there for a short while. The place was way too crowded (not sure if it's because of the Thanksgiving weekend).We didn't get to soak in the atmosphere for sure. We came in the evening this time and hope to visit it at another time of the day in future.,NoinahJaeb
20,So overcrowded it was hard to walk,This probably is nice but it was so extremely overcrowded we ended up not doing anything except one carnival game and getting some custard. I was literally afraid to let my children (7 & 9) out of my sight for even a minute because it would have been nearly impossible to ever find them again. The bathrooms were clean and nice for changing from the beach. I would suggest going early and leaving as soon as it’s dark.,Maegan2450
40,Crowded place but fun to visit - day and night,"Visited the Santa Monica Pier with the family a couple of times while on vacation and staying in Santa Monica. We enjoyed stopping by there, both during the day and with all the lights at night, but it is both crowded and loud so we did not stay long.The Santa Monica Pier is quite large and provides a selection of restaurants/bars, shops and an amusement park. It is popular and can get very crowded and busy, with lots of visitors mixed with people putting on shows, people fishing and more. It could get overwhelming with the kids, but when able to find a slightly quieter areas, it isfun to see all the people and enjoy the beach sights by day and the lights by night.",EagleFlyer

40,nice at night,"There aren't as many different places to eat on the pier as I would have thought but what we did eat was good. Lots of vendors doing the same thing, more variety is needed.

30,"nice beach, very crowded with lots of cars","The beach and sunset are very nice, but since everybody would want to park directly on the beach if it would be possible, it is full of cars lined up until where the beach starts.",The Travel Squad
50,Iconic Spot for local food and beautiful views,"We had a beautiful December day to visit. We went in the morning and had lunch before we left. It was the perfect time to go as the crowd started arriving around 11. If you have a warmer day I highly suggest going early. Carousel, Ferris Wheel and most eateries open at 11:00. You must stop in and see the carousel. It's simply beautiful. There is an area where you can watch trapeze artists, but none were there when we were. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth a visit. You can feel the nostalgia as you walk down the pier.",Stephanie B
50,Don't miss it if you're in the area!,"The Santa Monica Pier is the absolutely most perfect place on the planet! I only had several hours on one evening to stop by and view a sunset, then walk the pier, but oh how I long to go back! It felt like a dream that was cut too short! Living all the way over in Michigan makes it hard to revisit (time and expense wise), but GO, just GO visit the Santa Monica Pier. You will NOT be disappointed!",informer51
50,Exactly how I imagined it would be,"The pier was a bustling placeThe smell of food cooking people everywhere, rides, sideshow, the beach. It was fantastic.",Kimmywhits
50,Brisk cool ocean air...,"Parking as always is the problem, less so in January, but we are not in a movie where there seems always to be an open space right in front and nobody ever ever has to parallel park. Never have been on any of the rides, just a people watching stroll to the end of the pier and back. A great walk, how can LA people seem so foreign to we from Orange County? Always something to be amazed at here, not in a bad manner, just different from our own walks on the local piers. Dusk has turned into nighttime darkness, the bright lights come and go. The Ferris Wheel turns, if it we a bit warmer I would be tempted to buy a ticket for us.",James Weaver
40,Neat place but crowded,This was an exciting place to visit! It's very crowded though! Great place for beautiful pictures! The carousel was pretty. Bathrooms are gross! You have to take a pic with the Route 66 sign!,mnottingham
40,Fun and nice view of the beach,We had wondered along the beach from Venice to the Santa Monica Pier.Walking along the pier we had great views first out to sea and then back to Los Angeles.

30,Typical amusement arcades with various stalls.,"This is a typical tourist trap that one visits once in a life time. During the day time it is worth a walk and in the evening most stalls start to close around 7.30/8.00. Not romantic nor fun really, just a simple cheap amusement area.",pavakeal

Fun to say I've been to - check out the end of route 66. But overall it was expensive, crowded and hot. Parking was expensive. Our 2 kids (ages 7 and 9) wanted to ride rides but they were so pricey, so we didn't do too much here. Probably not worth it if trying to save some money.",TracyM

The rides were expensive, but we were in California so thats probably the ""normal"" prices for things like that. My only issue with the whole experience was there were SO many religious people screaming into microphones that it was kind of distracting. There was someone preaching every 20-30 yards. It was overwhelming. It was a great time, got some great pictures, I just wish there were not so many people reminding us that we are sinners and that we are probably going to to hell.",Melissa A

50,Lovely visit,I ventured here early in the morning before too many people were out and about. Vendors were just setting up allowing me to enjoy a casual and quiet morning walking the pier and boardwalk. Gorgeous!,cdog612
30,Once is enough,"This might be a thing for folks with kids or who have seen everything else. I thought it would be more fun, and maybe it is if you know what the fun things to do are. Or maybe our timing was off, given it was a Thursday afternoon in December. Kind of noisy and maybe I was just not in the mood for that. I preferred our quieter walk on the Hermosa Beach pier.",LunieSt_Paul_MN
30,Holiday,Went to Santa Monica Pier yesterday on a bus trip. As a tourist it’s something that if you are in LA then you go to. Once you go there you can check off your list as it’s not something you will do again. There is mostly fast food outlets and stalls with a couple of rides. It was ok but from all the hype surrounding it we expected something a lot different. Now we have been it’s not somewhere we will go again to.,korbin5
50,Ferris wheel and wharf fun,An LA signature wharf with amusement park and plenty of restaurants and shops. Nice way to end a Walk on a long Venice beach.Famous for its concerts and festivals.,Viktoriya K
10,Very disappointed,"Santa Monica has been on my list of places to visit for a long time. We arrived on an overcast morning at around 11:30am. The pier itself needs a lot of maintenance. It is very tired looking. There was lots of homeless people around, which can’t be helped but they were approaching us in an intimidating manner begging for money. We walked down the steps from the pier onto the beach. Despite all of the ugly brown bins lining the beach there is litter everywhere. There is lots of homeless people sleeping on the beach. We saw a man living under one of the lifeguard huts, we watched him inject himself with drugs. We decided we had seen enough within 30 minutes of being there and left in a taxi. We waited for a taxi on the ocean front walk where many homeless people have set up tents to live. Very disappointed. There was no police presence at all and felt extremely unsafe. I’m not sure how people go to Santa Monica and say it is a beautiful place.",Sausagedog97
50,Fantastic pier,"Great pier to visit. Lots going on for all ages. Rides, food, games, people watching, Mexican restaurant at the end of pier. Musicians playing and a perfect sunset at the end of the day",Nomad5522
20,Kind of a let down...,I was excited to see Santa Monica Pier and Venice Beach but they both sort of let me down. I understood going there that the spots were very commercial and circusy but it was worse than I had imagined and there wasn’t much going on at all. The metro takes forever to get out there as well. One plus is the Mexican restaurant at the end of the Pier which is super yummy with great service,Madeleine
40,A Fun Place for Kids,"Went here with my husband the week of Thanksgiving, it was still very busy despite being cold. My husband visited as a kid and wanted to show me where he'd been. While we still enjoyed our visit there wasn't a lot for adults to do. Regardless, we still had a great time!",Heather B
50,Cool place to hang out,"It was a great family visit to the Pacific Park, the Pier and the end point of Route 66 at the West Coast. Beautiful lit up at night and the kids love the whole experience and atmosphere!",Tian
50,Don't miss the pier,Great place to hang out. Lots of fun for the whole family. Lots of food choices. The rides are old but cool,wjsdunning
50,Basking in sunset’s glow,"After a grand stroll from Venice we arrived here in good time for the famous sunset. Delighted with Pacific Park we indulged in a roller-coaster ride, sufficiently before dinnertime for max thrills.Very popular with visitors and locals, it was great making our way to pier’s end at the top level. Entertainment was provided by a folk singer and his audience were very appreciative.The sunset didn’t disappoint, ending in a fiery glow over the ocean.",permia
50,Great early morning,"Walk or run early morning before all the crowds hit.it's amazing, you won't be disappointed.Walk along the promenade and grab some food or a drink, take photos and take in the atmosphere, it gets very busy. come early.",kelly19182016
50,so entertaining !!,"lovely place, my fav in LA. close to Expo Line Metro.cool musicians, tasty restaurants, beautiful views of the pacific ocean, fun attractions at Pacific Park right next to the pier, souvenir shops as well. would spent hours and hours there !!would recommend you to go to 3rd st promenade afterwards :)",Jacqueline P

50,Best view so far in L.A,Visiting Santa Monica Pier was real candy for my eyes. The view is amazing and I would say that it's even better if you go with your family or love. Charge your battery because there's many nice spots for photos.,emanuellandell
40,Funnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved it, you should definetly go.I went with my friends and we had a great time. And the rides were very fun. Kinda crowded tho.",nonofyourbusy-ness
40,Beautiful Pacific Ocean views in the midst of the iconic Santa Monica Pier,"We spent an afternoon here, first checked out the amusement park on the pier (great for kids), then did a little retail therapy a few blocks from the pier on 3rd (good mix of stores), then we rounded off the day by taking in the sunset on the pier. Loved how pretty it looked once the amusement park lights were on.",niavm2017
40,Good Afternoon Trip,"We came here in the afternoon so I think we missed out on some of the carnival vibe that some of the other comments seem to mention. It was a cool place to visit with a variety of shops for food and merchandise. It's got a pretty nice view once you reach the end of the pier. I imagine this would be funner in the evening once all the rides are up and running and it'd be more appropriate for a few drinks at that point as well. It has pretty easy access to the beach as well to just kick back and enjoy the Ocean.The only cons were that there were several people who were going up and down the pier using aggressive tactics to sell things they had on them. In addition to that, there are lots of homeless in the area, most of which I'm sure are harmless but it can make you feel a little uneasy when you're at quieter, more remote part of the pier.",Robert Szklarz
40,"Something for everyone, Seaside","The Santa Monica pier is a great place to be seaside for the family. There is something for everyone. We arrived at about 10 am. At 11:00 am, We enjoyed the Buba Gump restaurant for an early lunch. Early lunch is recommended if you have a larger group. After lunch we went to the beach. You should remember to bring blankets to enjoy a rest. To finish the day we went to the Starbucks.",spiritwheels
50,Nice Place Nice Food,Waoooooo Excellent food and restaurant. Its very windy some time but its worth go for eating seafood there . Any seafood restaurant is good . Enjoy it,Felix V
30,Carnival atmosphere,"Even during the day, the pier boasts a typical carnival atmosphere, with large crowds and many barkers advertising items that are rarely found elsewhere. Parking can be expensive. We parked at a meter for $2.25/hour, but the meters only take quarters, so one must prepare in advance.",1Wisetraveller
50,Beautiful Sunset!!,We stayed in Santa Monica for four days and were able to visit the Santa Monica Pier both in the morning and evening during the sunset. Coming from the east coast it was awesome to see the sunset over the ocean which we don't get back home. We also rented bikes one morning and rode the bike trail from Santa Monica pier to Venice Beach (Muscle Beach) which was very fun and scenic.,Ronald M
40,Pure Nostalgia,"This pier has a rich history. It's actually featured in a vert well-known, transformational book entitled ""Five People You Meet On The Way To Heaven"" (I strongly recommend that read). However, this mini-amusement park is not what it used to be. It can get very over-crowded and the prices are exorbitant. The best way to do it is to look for specials on Groupon or other like sites.I will say it's one of the most nostalgia-inspiring places in Los Angeles and for that it's worth the time and money spent. But not on the regular. I most recommend the dragon and roller coaster, two of the most fun rides. The arcade can be fun for kids as well.",Nick M
50,Amazingly cool,"If you seen in films you must go, just be aware that to english people it is an upmarket blackpool but well worth the experience and the views.",Dr Jamie Branson
50,Amazing Atmosphere,Spent an evening here during the LA trip. It is a wonderful place to just sit and watch the water. Some wonderful food options in the neighborhood and on the pier. The Pacific Park was closed at the time we reached to the Pier otherwise it would have been lovely to check that out as well.,Akshaya S
40,Nice place to spend the weekend mainly at sunday at LA,"I was there 3 weeks ago, walking and eating is a nice place several people, I prefer the morning if you go there , in the afternoon is crowded. Viajo sequido a California por un hijo que estudia alla y vamos a esta parte de los Angeles, muy agradable pero de preferencia en la mañana,,,,,",John C M
50,A must see!,"You must experience the Santa Monica Pier if you’re visiting CA! It has such a great vibe, with lots of little shops, stalls and food on offer.We went early in the morning when it was quieter, which meant it was easy to wander as not as much is open. We loved the pier so much we came back to watch the sun set!",Just Been Travelling
50,Mini Vacation,"stayed in Marina Del Ray and before leaving for Santa Barbara stopped by the Santa Monica Pier and what a collection of different attractions, from rides to restaurants to flying trapeze that from the looks of things anyone can try out, there's something there for everyone to enjoy and you can drive right onto the pier and park there , a must see if you're there",John N
30,Tacky and Touristy,Its Tacky and Touristy but a well know landmark in LA so its worth a visit if you have time. Plenty of food options but not cheap,Crusader007
40,Iconic place to visit,"We went to have lunch and it was great. Nice views, many dining options. Theres is also a wheel of fortune and plenty of other activities to enjoy. You have to walk your way in and out, across a bridge..",Claudia C
50,So much fun to be had with gorgeous views!,We spent a beautiful sunny day at the pier and made so many memories! We bought the unlimited ride bracelets which was well worth the money! We went right before the park opened and had a little snack and took in the views. We stayed for a few hours and then left to explore Santa Monica for a bit. We returned that night when it was all lit up and rode the rides again. I highly recommend getting the unlimited pass!,KeriLaura
20,Iconic Yes. Clean No.,"Cool place to visit. A piece of American history for sure. Amazing beach and great scenery. Easy access, a few interesting shops and restaurants. Unfortunately the area is not well kept or clean.Still worth the stop.",marsands2016
30,Sadly Expected More ....,"On an overcast day we pitched up here for a walk and although part of the vibe of Santa Monica the aged pier was full of Burger , Hot Dog & Cheap EateriesThe walk along the pier was sad as it looks tired and along by Bubba Gump there were lots of homeless people begging and tourists seemed perturbed by this but sadly it's the life for some people but not great for first impressionsWhat is needed is some new infrastructure in this venue to give it a faceliftSadly dissapointed ......",Paul S
30,Brighton in California,"Santa Monica Beach is a popular destination plus there is a huge pier. The pier is full of things to spend money on like a big wheel, merry go round, fast food, bars, souvenirs, tat. On the day we were there at the entrance there were people busking. The atmosphere was fun. Not for me as it was both lively and noisy but I could see young people were really enjoying themselves. A good place for a dull afternoon.",Catherine M
50,FIRST TIME IN DECADES,"I took some friends to the pier and although I previously lived in California I never really hung out at the pier. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to get in and out, and the restaurants were all open and had decent food. The little amusement park was nice as well. I even got on that two seat ride that you control and flips you all around. I had a ball to say the least and my friends had more fun than me. A definite place to just visit for awhile if you've never been. Checked!",Doc Scott T
50,A cool place to visit,Santa Monica Pier is a nice location to enjoy the sea and sun. very entertaining. The Mariasol Restaurant is worth a stop for Mexican style Food.,K2773WArogerb
50,"THE PIER WHERE MAGIC HAPPENS – FAMOUS, VIBRANT, FUN!","I'm pretty sure that everybody has heard of (or will hear about) the famous Santa Monica Pier. It's often seen in your favourite films or TV shows with its colourful roller-coaster and vibrant atmosphere.We visited during our vacation to Santa Monica and we absolutely loved it, we simply couldn't get enough.It has a theme park (Pacific Park - which is great fun for adults and kids of all ages), tonnes of restaurants where you can grab a bite to eat (with amazing surroundings) or perhaps a drink or two (or three!) If you're lucky you can even catch some fisherman reeling in their rods from the end of the pier. Whilst we were there we managed to witness something being filmed which was quite an experience (unfortunately we didn't see any famous people though).If you're looking for somewhere to eat we would highly recommend Bubba Gumps (famous for featuring in the film 'Forrest Gump') or Seaside on the Pier which has an outdoor balcony level that gives you amazing views of Santa Monica Beach and has the most delicious Pina Coladas around, the food is also super tasty (albeit a little expensive).The vibe on Santa Monica Pier is like no other. You will see the weird, the wonderful, the young, the old – there is something for everyone and I have never heard of a bad experience by any of my friends that have visited. There is so much to do and see, even if you're not looking to spend any dollar you can simply sit on the edge of the pier and people watch (which is an experience in itself).Overall we had a fab day out at Santa Monica Pier and we cannot wait for our next visit!Instagram: @journeywithuss",JourneyWithUss
30,Must see but better parts of Santa Monica,"As a resident of Santa Monica, there is a bit of nostalgia about the Pier. But like most amusement piers, the Santa Monica Pier is a must see for visitors, but beyond that, it isn’t the best part of Santa Monica. Check it out and then move along to the Santa Monica-Venice esplanade, 3rd Street Promenade, Ocean Ave, or Main Street. It’s historic and has a rich history (especially being the end of historic Route 66).",cjfbruno
50,Great perspective,"People in Santa Monica pay massive dollars to live there. And their taxes are through the roof. The beach water is full of human poop when it rains. It just makes me feel so very good about my life choices. Thank you, so much, Santa Monica for the perspective. Also, my brother lives here. Knowing his entitled butt lives with human excrement in the water really levels the playing field for us. I feel like it's made me a better person. Best part, you don't know the water is full of human poop until someone tells you.",1234
20,famous pier,nothing special! lots of people for me was too crowded ! i would say not worth to spend a lot of time! although there are some restaurants ( i didn’t tried them) but it is the famous Forest Gum Bubba one!,Albina Z
40,What you would think,"Very crowed. Have to pay for parking. You can park close to the beach, near the sand. The food lines go fast. The arcade games and rollercoaster type rides are nice. Nicer than Venice Beach. Would go again.",SydneytheQueen
40,Must visit landmark in L.A.,"Our family had a great time visiting the Santa Monica pier. It felt like we were visiting an open air museum. From the wood the pier is built on, the classic carrousel in the entrance to the fun amusement park reminiscent of Coney Island.Many carnival type food options as well as mid scale restaurants are available.If you go to the amusement park, the best option is to buy the multi ride band. It pays itself with only 3 rides.The views from the Ferris Wheel are breathtaking. My photo does not do it justice.",Carlos Onassis
50,Beach time,Santa Monica Pier is a great place for family to enjoy the sand and water. We encountered a dolphin and her baby swim close to shore. Amazing place,Diego R
30,Nice walk and people watching,"Easy walk and stroll on the Piers. Great scenery of the Pacific with the coast goes as far as the eyes can see. There is an amusement park, a few restaurants, and a gift shop. Many stalls setup along the boardwalk.",Lim EV
50,Sunset,"The beach and the pier have a good environment and you see anything from magic shows on the pier to people selling holographic shirts.Take a look at the sunset over the pier, because the view it’s something remarkable and I don’t think you can see that kind of sunsets easily on other places.",santiago l
10,I don’t get what’s the point of this place,It’s a waste of time I feel like. Nothing really to see really. The stuff there are old and they don’t even spend money to upgrade what they have.,Oliver L
50,Must not miss experience,"Spend an entire day at SM pier and the shopping areas nearby. Great place to just walk around and take in a big piece of history (Route 66) and spectacular view of the pacific coast.Park in the mall, grab a bite on 3rd street promenade and burn off that meal while walking to the pier. So much to do or even just ppl watch.",Kristina K
10,Huge disappointment,"It is dirty, small, full of beggars and tourist rips off. The rides suck and are incredibly expensive. Don't waste your time. Venice Broadwell is way nicer.",Lutitlu
30,For the younger crowd.... grown ups not so much!,Went here many times as a kid. Great carnival type feel on a pier on the beach.Best attraction is the ferris wheel. Parking is great and easy to find off Pacific Coast Highway.Great for kids!,Lentara71
40,A Must Do,"From the restaurants to the shops to just the view...the pier is a must do anytime I’m in LA for work. Next time, I’ll hit the roller coaster too!",ecbronze
40,Nice place to see the sunset,"This is a very touristic place but worth a visit. You have seen it plenty of times in the movies and tv shows. The pier has good options for a meal - although just across the street you may find more upscale restaurants - entertaining and souvenir shops. The all famous Route 66 ends right there. As for me the main reason to go there is to appreciate the sunset on a clear afternoon. Find your spot, grab a drink and relax enjoying the sunset by the ocean. A couple of blocks away, on 2nd and 3rd St, you have a shopping area with good stores and restaurants. I had only one afternoon in LA and went from LAX to the Pier using public transportation - free shuttle from airport terminal to City Bus Center then Big Blue Bus 3 for $1.25 one way . It took me c. 1 hour and was totally worth it.",Niro K
50,Iconic place to stroll,"Peaceful atmosphere first thing in the morning when everything was being set up for the day, it was a good time to visit",Rose H
50,Just really great fun,"When in southern Cali you must visit the pier. This is the historic end of Route 66 and just amazing with carnival rides, games and local street entertainment. Vender booths provide a wonderful variety of souvenirs and the is food for every taste.",Robin93221
50,Fantastic!,"This was in our tour and was so worth a visit!! Amazing pier with good facilities. Beautiful views from the pier. Lots to do including restaurants, arcade and theme park. Lots of entertainment going on up and down the pier.",Lorna and Matth... C
50,Love it!,"We love Santa Monica Pier, and we visit it every time we're in LA. The atmosphere is so much fun and so many cool characters are either playing music, selling memorabilia or doing magic tricks on the pier. the Paris wheel gives you an amazing overlook of Santa Monica and sitting down at one of the pier cafes for a cup of coffee while you're there is a must. We always sit close enough to hear the street artist (pannist) who plays on a steel drum to music, and it gives the music a nice Caribbean touch, I love it. :)",Carmen D
40,Always find time for a visit,We love to have drink and lunch followed with a walk along the pier watch people fishing and the Sea lion when we were there could see the smoke from the fires very sad.,teejay11

30,Good for a quick visit,"Not nearly as much fun as Venice Beach unless you have young kids who want to ride the midway attractions. We paid $15 (I think) to park at a nearby hotel, then walked around for about an hour.",Gregsky
40,How many movies have been filmed here?,"Classic icon that you feel you know when you visit. Lovely location and beach view. Always something happening along the pier. You can get food, gifts from local artisans, be entertained all from the one stroll. If your feeling energetic,stroll the Venice beach boardwalk. A nice stroll, which gets more colourful with the local scene, the longer you walk.",lorriskinner
30,The end of route 66,"A traditional pier at Santa Monica beach, with lots of options for food, drinks and shop. Lots of street vendors as well, and the traditional amusement park. Worth the visit",Fernando Ponce Leon
30,Glad we went,"We drove down from Hollywood. Traffic terrible. We found parking very easy to find, Did not cost very much compared to everywhere else in LA. We spent about three hours walking the pier and see the sights. Had drink at couple of the restaurants. Was an eye opener to all the homeless people. We felt safe though, There was police presence the whole time we were there. We enjoyed our time there. worth seeing.",114d2018

50,Iconic Pier!,"A must-see attraction in the Los Angeles area, the Santa Monica Pier is delightful, bustling, happening and beautiful. The pier personifies the Southern California stereotype. This is the western terminus of Route 66 and also is the first concrete pier on the West Coast. There are a number of entertainment options, restaurants, souvenir shops and the Pacific Park on the pier houses a few rides including a roller coaster and a giant Ferris Wheel. We went on the Ferris Wheel, which claims to be the world's largest solar powered one. The ride is slow and is quite good to take in some wonderful photographs of the Pacific Ocean and soak in the sea breeze. I'd definitely recommend trying your hands at some of the rides in the Pacific Park, there is also an arcade game center as well on the pier.There is something for all ages here. The street artists and performers add a very absorbing, often topical angle to this attraction. Fishing seemed to be quite a popular activity here - I saw a sizable number of people dropping off fishing lines along the pier. There are a number of different restaurants serving up food and dessert here. The sunset happened when we were on the Ferris Wheel, it was indeed a gorgeous sight to see the sun go down from the top of a Ferris Wheel!The blue Pacific coastline, a beautiful pier, typical SoCal vibe and some wonderful memories is how I'll summarize the Santa Monica Pier.",Nostalgiyeah
40,Nice place to hang and watch the people,Obvious a tourist spot on the pier but it is fun to watch the varied people as well as view both the ocean and surrounding hillsides. The beach is gorgeous as well,Gary C
50,Lots of fun,We had a blast visiting the pier. It was our first time in the area and enjoyed our time there. We will definitely stop by again if we are fortunate enough to visit this place again. We could have people watched and wildlife - seal- for hours. The entertainment along the pier varied from area to area. There was an older gentleman at the very end of the pier selling his cd's- I regret not having purchased one.,wkcb

40,"Nice pier, Good walk and full of interesting street performers","You just have to go here when in LA. Its Santa Monica Pier! It's the end of Route 66! It is just a must do attraction. Walk along the pier down to the end and see the wonderful street performers. We watched a magician, a street dancer and a few singers. 75% of them were fun to watch one seemed to be singing word by word for $1 a word so we kinda passed up on that.Spend some time in the shops and dont forget to visit the aquarium underneath. It's the best $5 per adult you'll spend.",Chris Stansbury

50,Funny place,"Awesome, it is really good place to visit, with family, friends. In that place you can find games, food (little bit expensive, I recommend Bubba's shrimps), also at the end of the pier (near to the ocean) you can find a lot of gift (magnetics, t shirts, etc, really nice and no so expensive)",Daniel Q
30,Closes down too early,"Went on a Thursday evening to find the rides and restaurants closing at 9pm. Not the energy level I expected. We all regretted driving here, except to capture pics of the Route 66 sign & eat dinner at Rusty’s! Great restaurant serving delicious mahi mahi!",SesameOntario

In the same day we visited TV series MASH site at Malibu Creek State Park, battleship Iowa in LA and NHL game at the Staples Center. All of them we found more informative and entertaining than Santa Monica Pier, sorry.",Thomasero
50,Great vibes,"Flew to LA and took a tour of Santa Monica beach, the boardwalk was super packed but filled with great vibes music, food, a small theme park crisp sunny weather and lots of great views especially for photography, as i walked through the pier there are people singing and playing instruments displaying their talents, vendors selling hats, shirts, balloons for kids, food and more the view from the pier of the ocean and beach was just breathtaking got to people watch and just enjoy life, as i kept walking through the beach trail off the boardwalk i ran into muscle beach which was an experience all on its own people playing music working out altogether just vibing was super cool to see i def recommend people of all ages to enjoy Santa Monica piers and beach whenever in LA.",J.

50,You have to go,"We took a side trip after a business trip to see the Pier, lots to do and see while you are there. I can understand why people think this is a tourist trap but this doesn't mean you have to spend money. Just go enough a sunset or watch the weather. One fact I didn't know is this is where Popeye was thought of.",Laker0213
40,Nice to visit as a famous landmark,"This is the iconic image of Santa Monica and the end of the historic route 66. The view is quite nice, but I found this place worth visiting more for the historic significance than the place itself. The amusement park is very small. There are a few stalls selling food, but really nothing memorable. Still worth a short visit. Also okay for people watching.",Karim Maarouf
50,As Expected,"We have always seen the pier on TV so it was a must see. Reminded us somewhat of Daytona Beach with the beautiful beach, waves, and pier of many talents and shops. It was fun to see the end of Route 66 that we someday hope to travel the distance. It was not disappointing but very exciting to see this part of Cali.",LMS
50,California Dreamin',"What an amazing place! Endless things to do and see, great weather and friendly people. Will be going back",Robin
50,Must visit,Must visit if in LA. Very symbolic location in LA made famous by many Hollywood films. (Forrest Gump) Also the end of the infamous Route 66. Great choice of restaurants and shops at the pier and surrounding area.,Rockman
30,Very Touristy,"Yeah, I was a tourist too...but this place is a tourist trap. So many people on a Monday in October! Side attractions trying to get your money. And the cost of Pacifica Park is ridiculous. Nice to say I went there once, got great pictures, but no need to go back again.",MamaP73
50,Fun side trip,"Drove down to spend a few hours at the pier. Great photo ops and plenty of souvenir shops.Margaritas and Mexican lunch at mariposa.Wandered around downtown, plenty to do and see for an afternoon.",Rob H
30,Busy but interesting,Walked down the pier just out of curiosity and saw many different artisans and souvenir places. Saw sea lions and folks fishing.,travelgal1994

10,Pretty grubby,"There is a huge lovely beach but the pier,though iconic was a pretty grubby place and the classic tourist trap and it successfully traps lots of them. Avoid but enjoy the amazing beach",tasty1111
50,Strolling,"What an awesome experience. Food, rides, games, vendors and entertainers. Not to mention the history of the Santa Monica Pier. A must when nearby.",busysvacationtime
50,Beautiful and buzzing,Go there for good vibes and to watch fit people working out on the beach. Rent a bike and ride the whole length of the bike path by the beach. It's fun.,Gina M
50,Great pier,"Went daily to pier and the mix of people was great.There are entertainers and a fair, couple of places to eat.Great place to people watch",muchbeer
50,Fun experience,"Lots of street performers, a fun fair, and most importantly the sea view, the route 66 sign stopped there and lots of people took photos of that. Also the Bubba Shrimp place looked popular.",luxeglobal
40,Worth a visit,"Have been here a few times and it's generally good but always busy. Local parking is expensive, street performers are usually good. Not had any issues with safety but heard there are a few pickpockets...police are usually around . It's worth visiting , beach is nice.a quick walk to the downtown for a stroll",Ryan K
50,Fun Afternoon,Very clean and interesting place. Great views of the ocean. Very expensive rides and games so we didn't stay long. Fun street performers also. Bring a lot of $1's to tip!,Carrie G
50,LA icon,"I stayed in Santa Monica 6 days and visited the pier 3 days. I loved the environment, the street artists, the atmosphere... Santa Monica wouldnt be the same without the pierMust see in LA!",MigueLatorre
10,Why ruin a beautiful Beach,I seem to be a European snob. Why have Santa Monica been destroyed by a roller coaster nightmare! Coasts and beaches should be natural and not filled with amusement parks! That being said the Beach is clean and water is nice.,MrsMZH
50,Lunch with friends,Went to Santa Monica and ate at Del Frisco's Grille which is directly across Ocean Blvd from the Santa Monica PierGreat afternoon with friends and sightseeing,JahCruiser
50,Life’s wonderful carnival by the sea,"No trip to Southern California is complete without a day at the beach, to sun, sea and see Santa Monica. And the best porch is the one called the pier. Fishing and trolling for carnival treats while watching surfers negotiate the cresting waves is worth the greater part of the day, any day or night",EdZ879
40,Must visit area,"Visited the beach and pier at Santa Monica while on a visit to Los Angeles. The beach is amazing, long white sands and enough waves to keep you body surfing for a while. The pier is busy and full of attractions, rides and places to eat. The bar /restaurant at the end is worth a stop for a cold beer or cocktail. Plenty of parking available too",Jessica W
30,An interesting place,Only went here because Tripadvisor suggested it. It's ok for a date as a teenager or taking your children. Great for pictures of the ocean and sunsets. Everyone wants to sell you something and there is a handful of street people that take away from the pier,Carlos A
50,Lovely family atmosphere,"We walked here along the boardwalk from Venice beach, lovely walk. I particularly loved the family atmosphere, lots of smiling faces. We did two rides, the wheel and the rollercoaster and enjoyed both. Fantastic views both ways from the Pier end.",Zoe B
30,Too crowded and touristic,"This is a long and spacious pier offering nice views. However, it is very popular among tourists and the service has developed accordingly; one can buy all kinds of junk here, watch street artists or overpay for mediocre food. It is still worth visiting with free entrance.",BeachStone2C
50,"Fun & lively place, and nice location","Great if alone, on a date, or with your family. It's very busy, in a nice bustling way. And an excellent location to get some nice photos.",Bassem B.
50,A must,If you travel to LA this is a must see attraction. What an enjoyable experience for our family. It was a night to remember.,449mathewb
40,A nice place to visit,The pier was the end of a nice stroll from Venice Beach. The pier is a lively attraction with lots of people and things to do.,Tony S
50,Exactly what I expected.,"Honestly, I loved it.It was cheesy, crowded, loud and so much fun. There are so many little street artists and performers making every corner a unique little niche. Even with the crowds it's just a fun place to visit. There isn't a lot to see and do on the pier itself, but it's in such a good area you are within walking distance of anything you could possibly want to do.",Claire T
10,Too much hype for this pier!!,"Visited this pier with family and didn’t feel it was made for families. The view and the artists on the pier are incredible, but it wasn’t the best! Went to the ride part- if a child doesn’t buy a wristband, the roller coaster ride was 10.00 each for a four minute ride 😳 Horrendous prices!! Found the arcade dirty, actually entire pier was dirty . Would not recommend!!!",#wanderexplorediscover❤️
20,Disappointed,I have always wanted to see the pier after cruising down the highway spectacular i arrived had to pau $15 to park my motorcycle i went up to the pier it was busy but slot of kiosk were not even open it was pretty disappointing i guess my expectations were too high after seeing it on tv so often,Colin B
50,Haven’t Visited In Years,"Super quirky but classic LA icon.Just walking around and people watching or enjoying some food & drink, this is a great place to visit.",zapprint
50,We loved Santa Monica Pier!,"For anyone travelling to Los Angeles, you must go to the Santa Monica Pier. You've probably seen it in movies your whole life and then you are there! Beautiful scenery, shopping, eateries, rides, etc., like nowhere else!",Margaret
40,Great at night,"Visited at night, great with all the lights and amusement rides. Plenty of stalls to browse and shop and also bars and restaurants",Hannibal611
40,Beach and sights,Take a break from amusement park...see Santa Monica Pier. It has the Biardwalk and the beach. Relax...,PickyPickyTracy_CA
50,Always worth a visit,Love love Santa Monica. Trip to LA wouldnt be the same if we didn't come here. The day was glorious.. just walking around checking everything out. We did walk along to Venice Beach but personally prefer Santa Monica.,Jane E
40,Pretty,I thought it was a cool place to visit. It's like a carnival on the pier which I'd beautiful at night when it's all lit up. You can see people with amazing talents and nice carnival food. I really enjoyed my visit there. The ocean view was calming.,Nikkia H
30,Underwhelming,"My Husband and I visited whilst on vacation and although we went in the day so didn't see it all lit up we both felt slightly underwhelmed. There is a lot of homeless around (there's a lot where we live but this was another level) and there wasn't much to do. The pier we have back home is far better, maybe we were just expecting a bit more.",Foxtrot
50,A bucket list tick,"Santa Monica Pier really is a place you go once so you can you have been there. You can see parts of it that you recognise from films, enjoy the buskers, buy a tacky souvenir and go to Bubba Gump Shrimp to immerse yourself in the culture of Forest Gump which if you are fan is pretty cool. It’s a great way to kill an hour walking hand in hand with a loved one.",Kirsty S
50,Beautiful,"Had a beautiful time at the pier. A lot smaller than I expected, but it was a lot of fun to walk around and see everything. Views of the ocean and of nearby LA and Malibu were breath taking.",ssims003
30,Visited as part of a Californian road trip,"Not sure what to expect, but we were somewhat underwhelmed when we visited the pier. It did celebrate the end of route 66 by way of souvenirs, but on the whole, the pier was mainly a row of shops and restaurants with a few fairground rides.",Fi55y
50,Fun.,Definitely a must see. The pier was awesome and much bigger than I thought it would be. Looks just like the movies. Wish we could have seen it at night.,Neverwins
50,Magnificent place.,"Going to Santa Monica and not knowing the Pier is the same as going to Rio de Janeiro and not knowing one of its most famous beaches or Christ the Redeemer, the Santa Monica Pier is (350 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, CA 90401) , it is 700 meters walk from Shopping Santa Monica Place, but I advise you to drive and leave in Pier's own parking lot, with cost, unless you enjoy walking, it is about 700 meters from each other. The Pier has a bucolic yet glamorous climate. Well known for passing in various Hollywood movies and series. It has several shops and restaurants, such as Bubba Gump, inspired by the film Forrest Gump, and Pier Burger, amusements like Pacific Park, a ferris wheel and roller coaster. It has the historical landmark that symbolizes the end of Route 66, which crosses the USA, and has a beautiful view of the beach and the Pacific Ocean, where there are always surfers. If you can, rent a bike and ride to Venice Beach, it's very close, about 2 kilometers. California, I'll be back soon.",Hilberaldi
40,Great attraction (time it well),"So I loved the pier, the history, the vibe, the shops. I just timed it wrong. I went with mates in the morning- mid to late and it was kind of beginning to warm up. If I had chance I’d have preferred to come in the evening as I reckon it gives off an even better time.Well worth a visit.",GowerDG
50,Fun place to visit.,Easy walk from our Santa Monica hotel. Great place to enjoy a stroll and people watch. Some interesting free entertainment. You can eat at place on the pier and just enjoy the view and free music. Worth a quick visit.,dton93
50,A must see iconic tourist spot,A visit to LA area is not complete without a walk onto Santa Monica Pier. We didnt go on the big wheel but it's pretty to see lit up at night. Busy night and day and my teenagers said the donuts were particularly nice. Free to walk on and one of California's oldest amusement attractions. Fishermen still cast their lines at the end of the pier.,Happy Traveller
50,Nice day,"A tourist must see, very picturesque and we have all seen it many times in the movies. I love hiring bikes and riding down to Venice or the other way. I have only been on sunny days which makes it even better, I would imagine it wouldn’t have the same impact on a rainy day. I really like the Santa Monica area it’s beautiful. We do things quick so it’s not an all day thing but you could drag it out. We started the day driving to Santa Monica pier, had a little look around then hired bikes to ride to Venice then rode back for lunch at Bubba Gump. If you do hire bikes and don’t intent on taking them back to the same shop you hired them from take note where you can drop them back, we wasted some time trying to find the return shop as 2 were closed.",mo71ey
40,Iconic place,Drive down on a Friday afternoon for sunset incredibly busy great for a bit of nostalgia lots of restaurants and a good vibe (would I stay here if on hols in LA ) ? yes I guess but one night sufficient if you wanted a bit of a beach hit in the city ...,theflyingwineman
30,Family holiday to Los Angeles,Not great - A bit of a let down and prices for the individual rides are expensive. A wristband is much more cost effective if you have time.Quirky gift Shop at the end of Route 66 is nice.Sea mist bike rentals underneath near the aquarium is a good option for a great day out.,helthea
40,Quiet Early Morning Stroll,Can't resist seeing the ocean when I'm nearby -- and took an early morning stroll on the beach and the pier. Delightful calm to welcome the dawn from the pier with the soothing sounds of waves below.Surprised by the number of people sleeping on the beach and on the pier.,Mary
40,Good Fun,"My teenage niece really enjoyed the arcade, and with most attractions only 75 cents it was very affordable.",Teresa M
50,Our Last Day in California,We decided to visit The famous Santa Monica Pier on our last day in California due to time constraint. Santa Monica Pier you did not disappoint. We parked our car at the shopping mall close by and simply walked down to Santa Monica Pier. There were a few bars and restaurants along the pier. You can see a few live entertainment which liven up the atmosphere. We saw the beautiful waves which hit the beach and lots of family and kids playing near the shore and basking in the sun. We stayed for sunset and had some sundowners at the restaurant. It just ended our trip in a high note. If you watched the movie ‘ The Lost Boys’ they had a scene at the pier which was deja vue for me. Definitely will be back again.,Nona Nureen
30,Santa Monica Pier,The Pier was long and had restaurants and an amusement park and entertainers here and there. Lots of people all the time. We wanted a sit down breakfast on Friday morning and the Pier offers fast food type breakfast. We ended up going to a place on the street above the Pier that was way too spendy but oh well...we were starving and just went to the first place we saw. I have asthma so had a hard time going up the hilly part of the Pier that heads back up to the main street. All in all I'm glad we went but probably won't be going back.,JamieLeman
50,Fun people watching,I had a down day on a business trip so visited the beach for some much needed exercise. Stopped on the pier for a late lunch and had an enjoyable hour people watching. It was a beautiful 80 degree sunny day. Food wasn’t as overpriced as I expected.,Kathy W
30,Really busy boardwalk type area,"This pier would be much more enjoyable if there weren't a zillion other people also on it, it's very crowded and hard to have a casual stroll around. It's an area more meant for families, but you can do some good people watching and see some nice views. There are a lot of homeless people around this area too.",Ali Van D
20,"Seedy Honky-Tonk, and Oh! The Scents of Rotting Fish and B.O.","If your idea of a Fun Fair is mobs of tourists tripping over heaved boardwalk planks, and weirdos hawking scabrous souvenirs Made in China, and tasteless fast food slick with grease, and boring short-circuit carnival rides at rob-you-blind prices, then Santa Monica Pier is for you. Dirty, smelly, shabby, overpriced. Too bad the City has let this once-appealing attraction become this shameful trap for unwitting tourists. But the local vagrants love it.",RThyme
50,Fun half day out,We walked around the pier and had a ride on the roller coaster which was $10 per person for two rides around the track. We didn’t eat here but enjoyed the atmosphere. There is also a lot of play and exercise equipment on the beach to use for free beside the pier. A pleasant morning activity before we walked to Venice beach.,myheartisinherts
50,Escape mid-week and off-season to the Beach,"Venture to the far western side of the pier for interesting music (Hawaiian ukelele and steel drums) and to see the official End of Route 66 memorabilia display. It's a calming way to spend several hours during off-season, mid-week at the beach. I loved the carousel ride and the history of the first Lifeguard team.",ckp4all
20,Fun place but needs a bath,The pier is getting a little seedy. There are a lot of sub par street performers that border on creepy. In fact the Venice Beach Street performers are a little higher quality which says a lot.The prices for the rides has gotten out of hand. They also need to coordinate the website with the calendar. The website said the rides were open til 10:00pm however they closed at 7:00pm. The pier needs a management overhaul,TravelingW2E
40,Santa Monica pier,Spent our last day of vacation in several spots. Santa Monica pier was very clean. There was several free entertaining shows going. There were musicians playing. Several souvenir shops for last minute gifts. Also purchased a sand stone carved by a gentleman on the pier. A great keepsake. Finished with relaxing on the beach on watching a sunset. Beautiful views all around.,simmonspj
50,I love this place,"I have been to the pier several times over the years and we usually take a long roadtrip from Kansas just to get here. But when you finally make it to the coast, The long experience is well worth it. California is a beautiful state period, But the Santa Monia Pier...the atmosphere...the people...that cali love is MAGIC. I love to just stand and watch the waves crash on the shore. There is almost always something new to do or see at the Pier everytime we visit. We have seen many Musical acts, some of which are or have become quite famous, and dining is good as well. Nothing beats standing on the pier and watching the sunset. Another fun fact is that Venice Beach is a short bike ride away, you could even walk there if you wanted.",a a
50,Final day,Stopped here before we headed home. The grand kids had a ball playing in the ocean and walking along the pier to look at the view. We took a picture in front of the Route 66 sign end of the trail. The weather was perfect and not a lot of people since we were there on a Monday. Well worth visiting if you are ever in the area,nanaof1boy3girls
50,Beautiful Pier,It was great to finally make it to the most beautiful Pier and enjoy the views and the atmosphere. I can highly recommend it to you!,Alexander R
50,A must see!,"I visited this iconic location early October, on a 28-30 degree perfectly sunny Saturday (approx 82F). As such, it was very very busy! However, it was still thoroughly enjoyable to take in the sights. There are some nice restaurants/bars there, and some fun rides for the kids. The water and the view back towards the beach and mountains are both stunning. The surrounding area is lovely too, also with great cafes and restaurants. It all looks very modern and clean. Well worth a visit!",Tanya B
40,Definitely a must to visit,This iconic pier is well worth the visit if you are in Santa Monica but it is very crowded at the weekends.,Margaret P
50,Lovely,"What a happy, safe place with great views to visit, on pier parking was more than reasonable... certainly better than venice beach which was sadly a little more occupied by homeless",jon8334
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Fantastic place for young families and couples, a fun park on the water with bars, restaurants, cafes, show rides and games. Great views from the Ferris wheel.",brchamp70

50,So colourful! So pretty!,"Fun place to go after downing shots at Santa Monica bars 💛 Best sunset and so many characters along the boardwalk, forever entertained!",rosysetephano
40,Visited an icon,The pier itself is seen in so many movies and tv shows that the family wanted to visit. It’s ok to spend half an hour walking. The vendors products are generic and better choices are nearby in Venice beach. Park elsewhere as the pier rates can be high,Paul H
30,it’s a a bit seedy but it’s fun,"If one likes Blackpool or other similar British seaside attractions the its great. It has a roller coaster other rides and attractions, unhealthy, but I am sure, tasty fast food, stalks and an assortment of bus cars and pedlars. However it also has a few decent restaurants, excluding Bubba Shrimp where most of the dishes contain sufficient calories to meet a male daily requirement.",Whitefox100
40,Nice place to visit,"We went to Santa Monica Pier for the day. The pier has games, rides, souvenirs, musicians and eateries. We ate lunch at Bubba Gumps which had really nice seafood. The views from the pier are beautiful. Overall, well worth a visit.",Matt.W
30,Not as much to see as expexted,Didnt really live up to what you see in tv and film - quite plain and not much to see. Indoor carousel only opens part of the week so check before you go,CD1984
20,Photo op only - over crowded and over priced tourist trap,"Get the photo at sunrise, sunset or at night lights then head back to 3rd street promenade. There really isn’t much to do on the pier except watch your wallet.",Neulara
40,A little of everything!,"We stayed at the Vicery which is a short walk from the pier entrance. Food, carnival like atmosphere by the ocean. Great place to see the sunset. The Lobster is a good place to sit and eat while the sunsets. Good for anyone to visit.",takeatripwithtipp

40,Crowded and rides overpriced,We parked in a public garage that was quite reasonable. Pleasant walk along pier. Did not go on any rides as the price was too high. The performers and artists along the pier were fun to watch. Had fun on the beach.,Bobbie G
30,Good to see,"Visited here as part of a tour and had an hour stop which was plenty of time. Good to see it and walk the length of the pier, in particular seeing the end of Route 66 sign but other than that it’s nothing special and didn’t feel like we needed any longer.",Robyn L
40,Holiday,"Walked from Venice beach, just to see the Ferris wheel from the Mitch Albom book ‘5 people you meet in heaven’. Glorious sunny day",veggieLisa
40,Love it here,The pier is awesome and the lights as the sun go down are brilliant. This is a brilliant place to go and unwind. If you want to do the trip along the pathway to Venice do not use the electric scooters as they won’t work. Either hire an ordinary bike or walk it.,David C
50,Great place for an evening,"We enjoyed a nice walk and a light dinner on the pier. The local artists were interesting to watch, plus some musicians proved to be entertaining. Plenty of souvenirs if you are nostalgic for Route 66. Simply a unique experience. There is a small amusement park for further fun. Plus they offer public restrooms and beach access.",Andy B
30,More Touristy Than I Expected,The Peir is super touristy so go if you are in to that. It is a bit directly like most busy piers tend to be. You can access the beach from the pier and it is a pretty beach and wasn’t too busy when I was there on a sunny day.,jmktravelsalot
50,On the pier,"Had a great time here good atmosphere, with live music and small stalls. The food outlets were nice. And a vintage merry go round at the very start of the pier. And importantly to people who have travelled on Route 66 like myself. The finishing sign on the pier. Really enjoyed the pier.",crow58
40,Beautiful,"This is a must see if in town. Beautiful old pier that you can walk along with places to eat, drink and buy your souvenirs. Visit the sign that marks the end of the famous Route 66 and there is a cool little store with plenty of little thing to buy to mark it and check out all the different currency's stuck to the walls from visitors. If you walk to the end look for the seal who gets fed by the people fishing of the end. View of the beach from here is also great.",GarethWatt

I was there Tuesday and Wednesday, unfortunately the Hippodrome is not open those two days.There is a lot to see, or sea. The aquarium is right next to the indoor carousel. There are many shops and cart vendors to peruse. Restaurants to try, including Bubba Gump Shrimp, Marisol's, Rusty's, and many more. There are artists and musicians to experience, sunshine, the sound of waves, happy people, and a nice breeze.I had several plans while I was in Santa Monica but I kept coming back to the pier instead. As I was leaving they were setting up for a live performance.There is just something about it...check it out!",Deborah S-K
40,Fun Area to Spend Part of a Day,"The Santa Monica Pier is a fun area to spend part of the day. There is plenty to see and do on the pier for all ages.

Visitors may walk along the pier in designated pedestrian areas. From the pier there are lovely views of the beach and Santa Monica Bay.",Cac1234

We're from the UK, and have some fantastic piers that knock the sock of here.Sorry, I just didn't get it, not great.",Natalie Starling-Booth
50,Wonderful!,We really enjoyed our time at Santa Monica pier. It looks very much like what you see in the movies! It was pretty expensive paying for each kid to only want to be there a couple hours. There wasn’t much shade or covered area so that made it difficult. Other than that it was beautiful to be a part of something so grand!,Amy H

30,Not what I expected,"We stopped here because we’ve never been and felt like it was something we should do. I always thought Santa Monica was a nicer area and thought the pier would be no different.Wrong.The pier is crowded, dirty, smelly, full of vendors selling touristy junk, and lots of homeless people. In the blocks leading up to the pier and on the pier. Some minding their own business, some outright begging.Parking in the nearby structure is free for the first 90 minutes so the best part was.... we didn’t stay long and got to park for free!",leahb908
50,Nice and Fun,Lot of things to do!Best: rent bikes and go to Venice Beach.The 3rd promenade is very nice.And the Pier has magic.,lolipascual
40,Bucket list trip,One of the items on our bucket list trip was to stop at Santa Monica Pier. Doing this trip in September meant less people which made it easy to park and walk around. The pier was clean and easy to view things. Plenty of eating places and gift stalls. It was a typical pier but glad to have seen it.,Caroline H
40,Lots to see,"We stayed about an hour and rode the ferris wheel ($10 each) while we were there. We took the usual photos at the end of Route 66 sign, there are good views of the beach from the top",GOgirl
50,Best boardwalk,"My family-friends and I enjoyed a stroll along the pier. Great gift shops. Musicians. Letter artists (so talented). There is a carousel and ferris wheel, and other attractions. Don't forget the restaurant at the end of the pier.The pier is the end of Route 66!What a fun place!",Lynn S
50,The Ferris wheel is a must do!!,"Flew into L.A. and headed straight to our accomodation in Santa Monica. To stretch our legs we went for a short walk to Santa Monica Pier. A great entertainment area with restaurants, gift shop and most importantly Pacific Park entertainment area.Comprising numerous rides Pacific Park was a great place to go.For a view over the beach and Santa Monica you cant go past the Ferris Wheel. A good length ride with great scenery. Reasonably priced and weWell worth it",Paul24507
50,Date night with the wife and kids,"Perfect weather, good company, with games and food all around. Not much one can ask for. Had a great time!",Roger89
50,Packed Pier!!,"I love piers so visiting here was high on my To Do list and I loved it! Visit earlier in the day during the week would be my advice as it is packed at weekend and later in the day. Sadly the pier shop near the carousel was shut on the 3 occasions I visited despite saying it opens at 10am and the carousel was closed off twice and couldn't find an operator for it on the 3rd attempt. There are plenty of other shops selling pier souveniers though, some of the eateries are very expensive compared to the UK but were very busy so they must be good. There is something for everyone on here, & I believe they hold free concerts here with local bands on week nights",whitbyabi
50,Loved it,"If you're visiting Los Angeles then how can you not take the time to visit Santa Monica Pier? It's a fabulous place, with a number of different restaurants to choose from, a fairground, the beach and lots of beautiful people. Quite a few people that aren't beautiful too - us included.It's easy to get to if you've bought tickets on the bus tours or you can simply get an Uber. Do go, you won't be disappointed.",BigCol63
50,World famous Pier!,"Highly recommend for a Saturday morning, music scene throughout the pier, fresh fruit vending, restaurants, lovely views and if you are lucky enough, you get to see sea lions swimming around the pier! Had a great time exploring last weekend!",Maria C Hunter
50,A most stop,The place is perfect for a break from everyday things. It is fun and ready to enjoy with beautiful people. Just be ready to have a unique experience.,Santiago F
40,"Fun vibe, good for mornings","We came here for sunrise and were treated to a magnificent view and experience. Hung around until stuff started opening so we could grab some breakfast; everything, ranging from food to attractions seemed to be good but not great on their own individual merits.There's a semi-clean public bathroom and a fair share of vagrants milling about - seemed harmless enough but it's wise to keep one's wits about them. All and all though, I was glad we stopped here to start our day.",MKB1701
30,It's okay. But not into amusement parks the beach is better,The beach is beautiful and it's nice to walk along the pier but really there's not much to it. So if you are not interested in going to the park part with the carousel and rollercoaster etc then there's not much on the pier except for some souvenir stalls etc. We were only on it about ten fifteen mins then left,Brid C
30,Nice to see,Did not do the rides but it is a cool sight to see and people watch. It was very busy but worth the trip and walk down the beach front to get ot the pier.,aloria3
50,A fun visit,"This well-known tourist attraction is fun. There are lots of things to look at and the vibe is excellent. If you are visiting the area, then you should allocate some time to experience all that the pier has to offer. How many piers have you seen with a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster on them? There are also eateries and shops on the pier as well as nearby. Lots of action!",eaglewhiz
40,Worth a little visit,"Very busy place, but worth the visit especially if you have kids. The ‘theme park’ on the end of their pier is $30 approx for all rides or $5-10 each so worth getting the full pass and doing everything.The view from the Ferris wheel is amazing!Definitely could do with a little update, but overall is a great place to visit when in Santa Monica",Georgia R
50,Santa Monica Pier/beach,Great diverse area to visit so much going on to see and do. Some nice eateries up the street also. Very cool vibe and good people watching.,Dianna F
50,Worth the cisit,"Great for tourists, plenty to see and do. Easy food options and located a short walk from the train station so easy to get to and from.",Matt Lammas
50,Iconic boardwalk and beach that is just too busy,"You really can't visit LA and miss this iconic boardwalk complete with Ferris wheel, arcade, dozens of restaurants, street performers, and of course the pier itself along the beach. The atmosphere is lively and reminds you of quintessential California summer, but it gets super crowded especially on the weekends. Parking is a problem all the time, and good luck finding a spot on the beach on the weekends. Still, there are plenty of amenities which makes this a good spot for families with children/special accommodations needs.",MWTTC
50,Amazing,This was super fun and I had family come in from out of town. The pier is beautiful and there is so much to do. From food to games and rides it has it all. The kids enjoyed it and we all had a great time. We found some cool gifts at the shops and the weather was amazing. Definitely somewhere I wanna come back to when the family is gone. Being a local I never really visit and I forgot how amazing it was here. If you have family in town this is a must visit.,Ryan Griffith
50,Family fun!,"Santa Monica Pier is a must-see if you are visiting Santa Monica or the surrounding area. There are a couple of restaurants and food stalls. However, I would suggest eating elsewhere in downtown Santa Monica as the food on the pier is overpriced.The arcade is a lot of fun and there is so much to do for everyone in the family. In the evening you can watch the beautiful sunset and, at nighttime, go to the very bottom of the pier to watch the fishermen.",meg305
30,"Check it out, but nothing special","We did Santa Monica and Venice Beach in the same afternoon. They are both very commercialized and can get very crowded. Santa Monica could be good for families if you had kids that wanted to ride the rides. We personally just walked the pier to see it, but did not spend much time. The food is overpriced, so we moved on. I would say to see it if you are in the area, but I would not rave about it.",EaglesFan27
40,Lot of things to do,"We arrived on a hot afternoon after having driven the entire morning. We did stroll around the boardwalks. There is plenty to do.... for amusement park enthusiasts there is pacific park on th pier along with all its bells and whistles there are also many shops to grab a quick bite or a drink. One can also laze around on the beach, but be prepared for the crowds!",wolf668
30,A must go to place but not overwhelming,Interesting place with several shops selling overpriced cheap stuff. Did have a good lunch at one of the venues. Too many homeless take away from the experience.,Michael K
40,The place to be,"You really can’t visit Santa Monica and not go to the pier.Recent history demands pier security be in place. So, just like the airport you must empty pockets and pass through a metal detector. Not complaining - grateful for stepped up security.Restaurants are on the pier as well as souvenirs shops and carnival games. You can fish, ride the Ferris wheel (seen in many movies), take great scenic photos of the ocean and hillsides and just watch an array of people passing by.Wear good walking shoes and watch your step because the pier is uneven. Bumpy ride for strollers and wheelchairs.While your there, enjoy the beach below or stroll or bike along the Oceanside walkway.",Paula L
40,Overcrowded,In the morning it is a wonderful place. After 10 o clock the tourists enter the Pier. The prices there not very competitive.,come back soon
40,Lively!,"Visited the Pier just before midday on Labour Day, the place was really busy and lively. All the eateries were busy and the pier in general had attracted a lot of people. If you have kids it’s great, plenty of stalls, kiosks, rides etc. If you don’t have kids, but still young at heart you will love this place. We don’t fit into either of those categories but needless to say that we thoroughly enjoyed a hour here people watching, grabbing a coffee and getting the occasional great photograph.",Reacher33
40,"Nice pier, Great beach","We had visited Santa Monica briefly on a tour of the city, and liked what we saw so went back later in the week. The pier is a tourist attraction, so buy, but not rammed, and you can walk around easily enough. Lots of street artists / buskers along the pier, some good some bad, some just plain amusing. None hassle you for money, and it was quite nice to sit and listen to the music while looking out over the ocean.The funfair is small, and around $5-10 per ride. There's a nice restaurant at the end of the pier, and a Bubba Gumps at the start of it. Both have views of the ocean,The beach is long and very wide with golden sand.",Andy K
30,Very commercial,"Go and have a nice drink in the restaurant at the end. Very crowded, in August i will have i think twice a week nice concerts. In case of any event at the pier be prepared for security check.",BeaBi
50,Made My Day,"Los Angeles is all about Hollywood but I am not fond of Hollywood movies except few movies & Web series.So the moment we hit this place we actually got the Adrenaline Rush. This place is full of Euphoria and the Cold Winds Nourished by the Pacific Ocean actually gives us the feeling of Tranquility.Live Music, Beer, Beach, Sea Food, Fresh Fruits & lots more this Pier had offered us !!!Must Visit Place :)",GKPA
40,Watch sunset,Came to pier to watch sunset. Great view and had a good vibe and atmosphere. A good selection of souvenir stores and restaurants to choose from.,keentraveller79
40,Pier and beach with easy parking,"You can easily park your car next to the pier. You might need to clim the stairs to the pier, but it will take you a minute from the parking area. From the pier you can walk up to the Santa Monica stores above. This we liked more in the end.",Sander
40,Busy beach in LA,We are very much excited to visit Santa Monica Pier as it is one of the major attraction of LA. We found the beach is very crowded and less organized which is somehow expected. The food was nice specially sea foods. worth of trying. The park is awesome.,Debabrata S
30,It was ok,It looks pretty neat from afar but I wasn't overly excited to see it when I got there. It's a pier with an amusement park packed into it. I took a quick wander then walked out. It wasn't a bad place but I found I wasn't overly interested once I got there.,westcoast778
40,Pier visit,"Pier has some shops. But especially the forrest gump shop and bench, end of route 66 are it' s main attractions",Jeroen
40,Touristy,"It’s touristy, but you have to do it. Can’t say that you’ve been to Santa Monica without going to the pier.",feedthetraveller
30,Family vacation,"I know it’s a historical place, and lots of movies and tv shows have been filmed there, but it’s really not that great. A few restaurants. A couple of places to buy Knick knacks. Really expensive rides. Don’t make a special trip for it. Parking and traffic is a pain in the butt.",SassyLaura
40,Worth a look,"Went here and spent the afternoon on the pier and on the beach. Clean and safe, the rides are basic but good fun. Food choices are good. If you have a choice between here and Venice Beach I would pick here, Venice Beach does not feel safe at all.",Paul F
50,"Amazing place. Please visit, ignore the negatives. Read on.........","I am a huge fan of Santa Monica Pier. The sights, sounds and smells. The street performers, the artists, the musicians. LA personified. People trying to make it big. People trying to make it small. And those just trying to survive.Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion and here is mineThere are some reviews here that don't like the crowds, the homeless people, the street vendors, the sideshows etc.It is an amazing place, in an amazing location. This attracts people. People attract other people. And inevitably, hoping to get something, those people attract others wanting to benefit from those people.Whether it be the performers playing for their tea, or next weeks rent. The homeless hoping for a something just to get through the night.Yes you get the odd nuisance person, as they will go where the people go. The beach beneath the pier is vast and it sits aside a city with over 4m people in it.Our 4 year old had a whale of a time. The arcades, the amusement park, the music and the sea.Please, go. Experience. Accept it for what it is, and enjoy it all!!We have been twice, and I have no doubt there will be a third time.",RichardChubb
50,This is living!,"What a wonderful time I had!! All the ppl, all the stores and sites to see!! You have to just go for the day and chill on the beach! It’s fabulous! I highly enjoyed my Santa Monica Pier Experience!",Buttacup_k
50,Very nice,The beach water was beautiful. The beach had A LOT of people but it was clean. The pier was very nice.,Kimela M
50,"""Must do"" visit once at least","Classic old American wooden pier with iconic welcome sign....and claimed end of Route 66.Really busy with funfair, restaurants and couple of bars and plenty of street entertainment.",R W
30,Mary Jaaaaane,"OMG....spliff smoking, bong gurgling every where. Bit off putting, but it is what it is. Lot of homeless people who keep themselves to themselves. Its different.....not a place for kids.",Darren C
30,Must do but not return,Another of the LA must do's busy typical tourist trap. Walked the pier watched the surfers photographed the sign and left $15 parking fee poorer - no real instinct to return no glamour as is often associated with it.,Ed D
40,Legendary,"In all honestly I have seen better piers here in the uk 🇬🇧 but there is something about this place that makes it special.I was surprised to see the amount of homeless people and addicts within close vicinity of the pier. Don’t even think of buying anything here because it is so expensive, it is beyond belief.The beach is beautiful and so is the park overlooking the pier. Stop here for some good photo opportunities. Unfortunately this is not for the weak hearted as this area appears to be a little bit on the rough side. Homelessness, drugs and alcohol abusers, and hustlers are all common place here.",Derrick O
50,Mrs Rehana Ansur,"We spent a long vacation in the states, in Los Angeles, California. We visited the Santa Monica boulevard and the pier very often. Very lively & good vibes. We simply loved this experience and would do it again and again 🥰",rehana14025
40,Beach Fun,"The pier was very overpriced and a little run down, but still worth seeing. I expected more artists and vendors, but we enjoyed the beach.",Alex Sandra O
50,Sunny,Had a nice relaxing day walking around and seeing so muchSo much too see and interesting stuff for everyone,debor967
40,Packed,"The view is worth seeing, but there’s just soooooooo many people. Tourists mainly, and some street performers. Kevin, the violinist was exceptional!",Maca
40,Santa Monica Pier,"The pier itself is very busy - a lot of cafes, shops, many people. But close to other streets, shops, restaurants. It is easy to get to other places from the Pier. The Santa Monica beach itself was great. But I preferred to spend time a little bit further then the Pier where it was more quiet",Lenara G
40,Great to have a look but wish it was sunnier!,We visited Santa Monica for a couple hours on a day that ended up being quite cloudy and windy so that was a shame. We did have a good stroll up and down the pier and stopped for lunch at Maria Sol.Glad we didn't plan on going on any of the rides as the park was closed for a private function for the day. I did stop at one of the little artist stalls and had a very sweet picture made - the man charged $1 per letter which was a bargain for me as I only wanted three letters drawn!Worth a look but now that I've ticked it off my list I don't think I need to come back again.,samkuzmar
40,Great location,"We stopped here on our drive to Los Angeles. A nice selection of restaurants and shops, very close to the beach",Andrew C
50,so pretty,"You should see the ferris wheel at night. it has beautiful lights shining on it that change continuously. It's a very long pier with all sorts of restaurants and vendors. It's world famous, so you should go if visiting L.A.",JoanneV095
40,Sunny day on Santa Monia Pier,Great to revisit the Pier. Very popular destination. Stopped for an ice cream and took in the Pacific Coast View. The pier is a mix of activity so never a dull moment. Watch out for the gulls and be prepared for a herbal scent in the air.,Nick_k_uk

30,Holiday visit,"The pier has some nice photo opportunities but otherwise it doesn’t really stand out as a holiday destination. Although the man singing half way up the pier was entertaining, possibly for the wrong reasons!",Jackie382
40,Fun times,Decided to catch the train here on our trip to LA. Worth the effort I think. Great views of the coast and a truly iconic spot. Great icecream too 👍🏼,Vaughan S
40,Busy Busy,"We did venture here on a public holiday so expected it to be a little more crowded than normal.Great place for families with lots of things for kids to do. Some places bit pricey but seems to be the way in tourist places. Stopped at Rusty's Surf Beach for quick drink. Great friendly staff, food and good drinks menu and very nice place to sit and people watch.",Michelle S
30,Touristy and crowded...but lots of families,"Although I grew up in SoCal, I had never physically been on the Santa Monica Pier...until this trip. Kind of fun to knock off a bucket list item. It has a few carnival type rides and attractions, some fast food also Bubba Gump Shrimp is there as well. Nice view of the coastline once you get out to the end of the pier. Street music and artists, some itinerant preaching all add to the vibe. Nice place to people-watch.",UtahTraveldude
20,"Beautiful beach, so so people","We went to this beach for 2 hours on a Saturday night(5-7pm). While the beach it’s fairly clean, and quite large, there is a large population of homeless and drug users walking around the beach.

50,A MUST VISIT IN LA!!!,"If you are in the LA area, you must visit The Santa Monica Pier! This attraction is phenomenal at any time of day! It is shown in tons of movies/shows and really if you only go to one place in LA this is the spot!! We visited in the mid afternoon, stayed till sunset and then enjoyed the pier with all the beautiful lights on!!!! Soooo much fun and so much to do!! We people watched, got on the rides ( get on the carousel if it is open), played/ran on the beach, ate lunch/dinner and snack, and shopped at the pier shops!! We visited with my 93-year old mom, my teenage boys (16 and 13), my sister and husband. Everybody had a great time!! Don't forget to take a picture of your group with the Santa Monica Pier on your way down or up!!! ENJOY!!!",Alicia M

40,LA Tourist trap - but in a good way,"If you go to Santa Monica, you have to walk the pier. It’s an LA institution. It’s going to be crowded with tourists but it has tons of things to do - restaurants, sitting areas, games & rides for the kids - to satisfy everyone in your group.",Courtney H
20,Dull and unsafe,"Could not see the point. There is nothing this place offers that might be interesting at all. It was reasonably crowded when we went and I felt quite unsafe, both due to the setting and also to the type of people around. We just peeked in and went straight away.",Dr_cooke
40,Route 66,"Fun rides, antique board walk. Family fun. Great views of the mountains & Pacific at the same time. Easy access to the beach",Momshine
10,The So Cal Place to Skip,"Oh where to begin...over priced parking, crowded disgustingly dirty pier, filthy rides, street hawkers and cheap food. I went 20 years ago and wow...what a shocking difference. Our teen boys wanted nothing to do with the rides. We were harassed three times by people wanting us to find Jesus. Yelled at by a mentally unstable man that we were going to hell if we didn’t repent. Watch your pockets and bags. Drive by and look or stand at the entrance and take a pic but do yourself a favor and save a trip walking down the pier.",Campbls
50,Beautiful sunsets and sunrise,"Been here for both sunrise which is much less crowded and peaceful, and the sunset on a Saturday night where there is a boardwalk which rivals Coney island in NY.Great ambiance and lots of vendors selling churro and lighted Disney toys. Definitely check out the fishing area at the end of the pier.",JCtennis
40,"Beautiful sunset, great for photoshoot","Early 30s couple, traveled to LA for a few days. Stayed by LAX and the pier was a very cheap Lyft ride, considering how long you could spend there.We arrived about 2.5 hours before sunset. it's free to get to the pier, but the rides themselves cost. We had dinner at one of the restaurants on the pier (I forgot the name), but EVERYTHING for food is expensive! They tax on everything, soda/pop cost us $4 each at the restaurant! It was good, but if I had known ahead of time, we would have just had a picnic on the beach.As the sun set, the pier came alive with lights. If you have a thing for photography you'll have a blast! Underneath the pier also has a beautiful setting for pictures. When you're on the beach, it's clean, wasn't very crowded. Good street art there as well.Any other questions, just ask!",BrothaBlake
40,Stopping by the pier,"Parking is convenient and cheap $1per hour. The pier was alive, bathrooms are clean and nearby, lots of people. The corndog vendor was delicious and we also received info there to do the celebrity home tour.",24kpearls
50,The sea here is beautiful!,"During our 7 night stay in LA, we visited Santa Monica beach & pier twice. We have 3 children aged 17, 12 & 9 and they loved it here. Beautiful views, sand is lovely and warm, sea is beautiful and warm to after a couple of mins. We spent ages in the sea both times.Facilities on the pier for getting changed etc are very good. Plenty of food to choose from and plus the rides (we didn’t go on any but people seemed to be enjoying them)A very pleasant trip both times",Basi5

50,Fun and historically interesting place to spend several hours or the day.,"Santa Monica Pier is one of those historic places to visit in Southern California. There are plenty of activities for both children (amusement park rides) and adults. Music, some good restaurants (Bubba Shrimp), lots of action and a good place to people watch if you enjoy that. It can get very busy on the week-ends, but in some way that is part of the entire Santa Monica Pier experience. Great place to enjoy beautiful ocean views and feel the ocean breezes. Highly recommended.",Parvati P
50,Cool place but can be crowded...,Very busy late in the day but easy access earlier in the day. If you want to go to Bubba Gump make reservations or wait for an hour. There are other good eateries on the pier. Kids liked the rides as they hi-lighted the Santa Monica part of our vacation . Great food in Santa Monica!,Randy K
40,Historic and social media friendly...,"You've seen the world famous entrance sign and the pier on TV, in movies, interwebs, etc...Yes, it's definitely a must visit once. It's still fun for me after years of visits...Street performers and activists congregate by the entrance sign. You walk down you get a great elevated view of the pier. It's packed with locals, tourists, families, couples, etc. On the pier there's cafes, street vendors, amusement park rides & games, full service sit down restaurants. Street food options and desserts are your best bets on the pier. You get great views of the beach and the Pacific Ocean so there's plenty of social media moments to be made here.I'll always visit the Santa Monica Pier whenever I hang out at 3rd Street Promenade. Every visit I make a new memory and I reminisce of recent memories made at the pier throughout the decades. May you create some cool ones here yourself. Cheers!",Steff A

It’s free to go on and there are loads of things to see and do, from buskers to souvenir shops, to arcades to rides.Yes, it’s very busy, and yes, the rides are overpriced for what they are (the unlimited wristband offers better value if you’re there a while) but we still loved it.",jawsie1

40,So much fun,First time in LA so we decided to go to Santa Monica Pier. We did some shopping downtown and then walked on the pier late afternoon. The pier was very crowded but the beach was not so much. Still found a place to sit on the pier and was able to relax,debbie0011

20,Put me off as soon as we had to undergo security screening,"It felt like a seedy amusement park on a pier. Our first impression was having to pass through electronic security screening, which we hadn't anticipated. A non-English speaking official just pointed at what I was carrying and mimed what he wanted - I found this highly irritating (and rude) so I eventually told him that he needed to talk to me if I was to understand what he wanted. Non-existent customer service - we're tourists contributing to the economy but they seem to have missed that. Wouldn't bother with the crowds and officialdom.",Rachel H

50,Get the bands,"Always a great spot. Try to get onto the ferris wheel for sunset, you’ll never forget it. Plenty of deals out there for unlimited ride wristbands, without the it’ll get pricey quickly. Do three rides or more on a deal and the wristband has paid for itself.",ClanClark
30,"Little crowded, little crazy","Big day at the pier. It was pretty crowded, even though there wasn’t anything special going on. Always interesting, crowded, interesting, iconic, but nothing special. The area at 5he top of the pier was much better. Plenty to see, shopping, restaurants.",David B

20,Still the same,"I went here fifty years ago when I was a kid. I thought it was wonderful then but now I realize it's still the same as it was. Terrible food, only a couple things to do, long lines and expensive. I guess it's somewhere to go if you've got nowhere else. And, if you're on the beach already what the hell right?",Old Pro
50,Beautiful beach!,Another must see if in LA! Lots of vendors on site. Beautiful dandy beach. Beautiful atmosphere. There was a nice cool breeze so made the stop comfortable.,sonobela

50,Nice area. No weed smell. Lots to see,Went today for a look around. The Pier is free to enter and it’s lovely and long. Loads to see and do and eat and drink. The sea looked stunning as well.No weed small either but oh my good go further up to Venice and it stinks.Some good restaurants nearby also.,Craig D
10,Skip this and go to Malibu instead.,"The area (this pier in particular) isn’t worth visiting if you’re only in the Los Angeles area for a short time. I question the motives of any blog and/or website that tells travelers this is a must see. I’m sure back in the day it was. But the vendors crowd the pier and there are WAY TOO MANY people allowed to fish off of it. They take up so much room.It is in desperate need of a facelift. I can’t help but wonder why in an expensive city like Santa Monica, this “iconic” location has been left to look and feel so terrible.It smells. It’s trashy-the beach. It’s overcrowded. Go down the road a little ways and enjoy Malibu and Malibu’s beaches. It’s a busy place, but it is a better experience over all.",Amanda Stockton
50,🎥⭐️ 💃🏻,Nice 👍🏻 I like the place and the live shows. I specifically went to see the lady who dance and play Arabic music 🎼 💃🏻,Emirati Vacationer
40,Great Place to Spend the day!,"Visiyed Santa Monica Pier whilst in LA & have to say its a great place to spend a couple of hours! Yes its touristy, but hey I'm a Tourist... certainly worth seeing! Highly recommend whilst in LA",Mark D
30,"Just to have seen it ""live""","After seeing the pier in numerous Hollywood movies this is probably a must to most people visiting LA. Nice beach, easy parking ($10) and well worth spending an hour or so just to being able to tell your friends that you have been there the next time you see it in a movie. Oh and the “Fortune-telling machine” Zoltar from the Tom Hanks Blockbuster movie “Big” from the 80’s can also be found on the Santa Monica Pier.",Fretel1891
50,So much to see!,"Not sure exactly what I expected, but this was MUCH more! SO much to see and do, you could easily get here first thing in the morning and stay until late night. Not sure I love the buskers at the start of the pier, they sure are friendly, but snapped back the ""free CD"" as soon as I told them I had no cash to offer. We stayed for a few hours and had a very nice wander, along with a lovely meal at the end of the pier. We stopped at the Route 66 kiosk where they do quizzes and hand out completion certificates, but we were starting the Route that day (westbound), so we got some GREAT advice and had a nice visit, but we'll have to come back for the certificate later.",Sharon B
30,"It's Ok, but a must do, but sooooooooo busy!!","We really did not like SM at all, so busy! We walked down to the pier having parked in the upper city area. This was just so busy and so many vehicles around, but luckily a nice walkway down to the pier!! There is a lot of attractions and shops and eateries, but this attracts so many people. It's good to say we have done it, but unlikely to revisit. Recommended to tick off a list!!",MPP2703
20,nothing special,"This is fine for kids or someone who would like a quick casual meal, but otherwise time could be better spent at other Santa Monica venues. Navy Pier in Chicago is much better, except for the weather.",Erwin K
40,Quick visit,"The pier is massive and very busy, but well worth a visit. We didn’t buy anything or go on any rides, but it all looked good. It was pretty windy, but that made a nice change after the heat of Hollywood.",MarkAnf

50,Nice and relaxing place,"We spent a full day of activities and relaxing the pier. 3rd street is not far from there with a cool mall, stores and lots if restaurants. I piked with my kids for few hours. It was a great day!",Ammar A
40,Lovely day on the pier - go early!,"I took my 2 adult daughters to the Santa Monica Pier on a Monday. We mainly went to see the beach and sea lions that swim around at the end of the pier. Our Lyft dropped us off at the pier around 10:30am, which gave us time to check everything out, take some pix and see the sea lions. We were also there when the Pacific Park rides opened and the ticket line was lite. $35 pp for the all-you-can-ride wristband, which was the most cost effective choice, as most a la carte tickets for the ""big kids"" rides were $8 each . There are 12 rides in total and my kids rode about 8 of them (the 4 exceptions being kiddie rides). See also my review for PACIFIC PARK.Overall - the pier got more crowded as the day went on, so I was glad we got there early. There are a ton of gift shops, all selling pretty much the same trinkets. I got something from a small ""cash only"" stand. Wasn't expecting a cash only situation, but always like to keep a few bucks on me ""just in case"".",necowgirl
40,Lively busy location.,"The pier is busy all the time, we had a stroll along it early evening 8pm. The bright lights from the fairground attractions are vibrant and colourful. There are numerous fast food places and ice cream and sweet shops. Gift shops, T shirt and baseball bat shops etc. Lots of families with young children and people walking dogs and couples, a good mix of the generations. Prices are inflated but that didn't seen to stop people buying and having a good time. We spent 39 minutes there as it was very busy . Young people, children and the young at heart will enjoy it.",Julie C
30,Touristic and dirty,"A must see, but in fact not very attractive. In desperate need if renovation and a clean up (bird poo all over).",Eric D
40,The Only Thing Missing was a View from the Top!,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic piece of Americana and it was just how I wanted to end my solo trip to California. It was a cold, windy day but that didn't deter the crowds. The arcade was bustling, the rides were going and it was just cool enough to enjoy a hike from the pier down to the Venice Boardwalk and back. This is a must-see if you've never seen it. You'll recognize the sign and many stores from television and movies. It was a near-perfect California day. Note: I had visions of spending the day by the ocean and enjoying the beautiful view from the top of the ferris wheel, but they don't allow solo riders! I'm a happily married woman who enjoys solo travel. This is the first time in all my travels that I've been unable to enjoy something because of it. Still, the Santa Monica Pier and surrounding area was such a great experience, I'm only dinging it a point.",Sara C
50,Wow,"Something I've always wanted to see. It blew my mind that there was parking on the pier. The carousel is beautiful, amusement park pretty cool and the information boards at the end of the pier was informative. Plenty of restaurants and souvenirs along the walk. Definitely something to see and do.",938elizabeth
40,Fun Place - As Any Other Pier!,"The Santa Monica Pier is quite similar to other such piers or boardwalks that you will find at other port cities in the US, and as a matter of fact, in UK as well, such as Brighton and Blackpool. There’s a ferris wheel, a carousel, a roller coaster, arcade games, a couple of restaurants/cafes, and LOTS of people! The pier is just next to the Santa Monica Beach, which is convenient. There is ample paid parking available. As a tourist, it is better to visit the pier, the beach and the 3rd Promenade on the same day.",ShoaibShawoo
40,Iconic but expensive,"A must see, free to walk up and down the pier, but very overpriced, eg $4.50 for a small bottle of water, and very busy. Worth it for brilliant views of the bay however.",Dan

50,The Beach is Gorgeous yet Fun!,"The biggest and most beautiful beach I have seen. It was a little crowded, but not uncomfortable, I was able to be in my own zone with the ocean. The pier was a lot of fun, albeit quite expensive $10 just to ride the rollercoaster. The worst part of my trip was the traffic getting out of the city. Overall I had an amazing time there.",Jhindman
50,Great place,"We spent a great sunset at the pier. The kids had a great time running on the beach, and enjoying corn on the cob. Fun, food, music and more. It is must.",Traveler mom
40,Good food and Good times,"If you have been to the big parks like 6 Flags, you will appreciate that this one is small but incredibly well maintained and fun. The biggest difference is that the food from the vendors is amazing. It could be that Texas parks have crappy food, but the food is really good here. Any vendor that we tried, we loved it. This is a great 4-5 hour activity. It gets busy in the evenings, so if you are on vacation, go early in the day before the crowds pick up.",Camino_Jim
50,Summer staycation!,A great time with friends every time we come to Santa Monica! There’s always a lot going on and tons of people. We usually end up grabbing a bite to eat from a local bar or fancy restaurant whatever food we want because it is all available.,AdaOha Erma M

40,Awesome rides for smaller kids,The pier was an amazing experience for the kids they enjoyed every moment of if the rides are very much suitable for the younger kids as they were able to do at least 90% of the activities in the park would definitely recommend to family with small kids age 5 and up,Orlando R

50,Amazing at night too !,"Night is when the LIGHTS are up and everything is neon with families, Kids, Couples- Lovers come out to have FUN.Highly recommended to visit in evening like 9 PM.",Junior
40,One of the highlights of the trip,"Now this is the LA I expected- came here for a quick visit, but really enjoyed it for the people watching and a bit more of the real LA experience- it’s mid summer so it was chaos people everywhere just peopling... the beach was packed. Noise pollution everywhere as everyone competed for a few inches of beach of space on the Pier. It was nuts (ps I don’t like crowds). But the atmosphere was great and we all had fun... I would go back to Santa Monica again... (possibly stay there next time) we did get stuck in a traffic jam on the way home at 8.30 pm on a Sunday night. (But that’s LA). But damn now I can’t get that Cheryl Crow song out of my head!!!",Bianca B

40,Great ocean view,"What a fun place! We just walked up and down but I imagine if our kids were with us we would have been testing out the rides. Bought a top from Buba Gump Shrimp to keep warm and we did not know it was the very end of ""route 66""",Nataleigh S
20,Crowded. Try to avoid,"It's good for a quick walkthrough, but it is way too crowded to be safe.Furthermore, smoking is not allowed anywhere on the pier, so this is not a place that a smoker would enjoy.There are better places to have fun in this city!",Nikos M

20,Not much to experience,"Of course a must to stop by this historic place, but apart from a small amusement park and very expensive places to eat, there is not much to do on this pier. There is cheap parking on the actual pier, suitable for a short stay.",HannaBragberg
50,Great views...,"If you go here expecting anything other than a busy seaside pier, you'll be disappointed.

40,the end of Route 66 !,"If in Santa Monica, you have to go to the Pier as an honarary tourist! It's a must. Go in the day time for less people or go in the evening if you love crowds. There is Bubba Gumps restaurant in the beginning and a few other eateries along the way , with one more at the end of the pier. Watch fishermen attempt to catch a fish. See vendors of all sorts for your official souvenir and listen to musicians up and down and all around looking for a small donation for their talents. There is a good little soda shoppe down at the beginning of the pier that is easily missed. Good Sundaes and icecream at reasonable prices and a carousel inside the building for the young and old to ride. There are also a few amusement park rides in a carnival atmophere off to the side with the iconic roller coaster that can be scene for some miles away and looks cool all lit up at night. Santa Monica Pier is also the end of the line destination for the historic Route 66... where everyone gets their picture taken at! :)",chips57

30,Santa Monica Pier,"Extremely crowded, but it’s pretty cool. I love coming here for sunsets, but parking is extremely hard to find before the hours of 7pm when parking becomes free in some spots. There’s performers toward the end of the pier, and they’re pretty entertaining to watch. Pacific Park is expensive ($10 for one ticket to ride the roller coaster), but it’s a tourist destination so it’s to be expected. Despite hundreds of people being on a pier that I am shocked can hold all of this, I find it very relaxing coming here and watching the sun go down. Down on the beach, they’ve even got flags of the different counties.",Tessa
50,Summer Family Vacay 2019,One of my highlights of our trip was walking the pier. Great ocean views. Good people watching. Ate dinner at Bubba Gump Shrimp.The only downfall was my husband wanted to see Muscle Beach at Venice beach. GPS says 2.2 miles away and it took us 1 hr to get there. And Muscle Beach is “closed for renovations. But we got lemon ice on the walk down and walked the beach shore back (50 min back to pier).,savy-mama97
30,We like the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk better,"After hearing so much about it, we were surprised on our recent visit here to find that there wasn't much in the way of rides and the whole experience was like being on a conveyor belt walk in and out.

It's no Disneyland but it's not pretending to be either. If you're not careful here you could spend Disneyland money for nothing close to the same experience but, if you pop onto the pier, take a few rides/games and leave, it can be a fun hour or two.",BeeDubYVR

But then we spotted the famous sign, and the end of Route 66. It was very underwhelming, on programs and films it seams so much bigger.

50,Teens loved it,We visited this beach and Vience beach on the same day. The teens loved both beaches and really liked the carnival rides here. The wife liked the Promenade shopping here the best.There was ample public parking and getting in / out was relatively easy compared to Vience beach.,Gary T
30,Overcrowded! Go early!,"I visit the Santa Monica pier every time I'm in Santa Monica (3x per year)... and every time I ask myself WHY did I do this? Unless you go very early in the morning, this place is thronged with tourists! Even if you just want to wander to the end of the pier to take in the view, you'll have to run the gauntlet of selfie-taking, ice-cream dripping, goggle-eyed tourists, families and teens all wandering (seemingly aimlessly) around the pier, the amusement park, the beach, and the streets immediately surrounding the pier itself. It's definitely worth a visit. But my favorite times to do so are early early in the morning (like 8 am, before a lovely breakfast on the beach).",seatowngetawaygirl
40,Tastefully Tacky,"A notch up from a carnival, it is tacky but felt safe with reasonably present and visible Santa Monica Police and pier security. Highlight is Trapeze School of NY if you feel a bit inspired for mild adventure and a bit strenuous.",jcl08
30,Disappointed,"First of all do not drive to the Pier. Uber or research where to park because ALL of the parking along Hwy 1 was closed. North and South lots were full. We drove several miles trying to get to a lot that was open and it was a huge headache.Next, once on the Pier there were several people strategically located with loud speakers preaching our doom, death, ultimate eternity in hell. Just when you think “oh good, passed that” another one will start back up. This takes place the entire length of the Pier.It was also super crowded which I can handle and expected because of the parking.We got appetizers and drinks at Mariasol’s at the end of the Pier. It was good and fun.I’m glad I went and saw it but after the hour long journey of finding parking, then being screamed at by the preachers, and completely consumed in extremely large crowds of tourists (just like me) I would recommend not going in the summer months, afternoons, or weekends.",JP&CMom
20,To crowded,"The pier had way to many people! It was barely standing room only. If everyone would walk or move to the side it wouldn’t be so bad. It was just to congested and busy for us to get to enjoy. We walked to the beach but, it was even worse. I do not recommend it at all.",amyhass
10,"Overpriced, overcrowded, and not much to do","All of the shops were souvenir shops. 90% of the street performers were terrible (Literally there was a ""magician"" tearing a rope in half and putting it back together, and a scary-looking 60-year old man singing karaoke very poorly.) The food options were not appetizing and the ""theme park"" at the end of the pier was, um, bad. There is one roller coaster and it's biggest drop is around 10 ft. and goes less than 30 mph. The rest of the rides were all only for children. Even the bumper cars were no good (all one-way; no head-on bumping). The beach looked nice and clean, but it was too cold to go. The aquarium at the front of the pier and the century-old carousel were both nice attractions, although small. I would recommend spending your day at any other LA beach.",Corbin B.
30,Not as nice as I remember,"Although still a beautiful view, this place is now full of homeless. A bunch of gift shops and people trying to sell things. Great for pics. Leads to the free beach where you are also getting harassed to buy things",Tara D
50,Fun,We biked from Santa Monica to Venice Beach and back...great views out to the sea and people watching. Sadly our whole trip around California has shown so many homeless people and thats the case here too. Worth doing - 2 hours well spent.,karen b
50,Wonderful!,"So much to do here, we loved it! From buying souvenirs to enjoying a nice dessert at the Funnel cake, it’s the best. You can enjoy lively music and watch the ocean waves, it’s beautiful!",Raintreeflower
50,The iconic pier overlooking the Pacific Ocean!,"The Santa Monica Pier is iconic and classic California. Often crowded, but worthy of a stroll along this wonderful spot.",Dana Los Angeles
30,Fine,"I guess it' a good place to have a drink and watch the ocean, or to take the kids for a ride in the amusement park. But I didn't enjoy it. I felt that it was just a bunch of people trying to sell me stuff concentrated in one spot.",eib2017
40,Pier or Amusement Park,"This is an amusement park, Ferris wheel and more, built atop a pier. It is an exciting entertainment centre. It was crowded on our summer visit. Lots of load music, some live.",InnaYYZ
30,Felt Obligated to Visit!,I could have gone without it but... we were here and we can say we did it. A local tried scamming me by I called my husband over & quickly he disappeared. I saw ZERO security. And a place like this needs it. It’s your typical local carnival. But probably a lot more expensive. We’re touring California and this was a historical landmark that we had to experience but honestly unimpressed. It looks better from the hotel in the distance.,SparBoys
20,Busy touristy pier,"There’s not much to say. Santa Monica pier is a busy, touristy, crowded pier with shops and eateries. Though we enjoyed taking a pic under the Route 66 end of trail sign.",carolemp2
30,Try Again In the Winter,I was really excited to see the Pier but i feel like i didn't get to see any of it because i was fighting through crowds to walk down it. It's a beautiful view and it looks like a lot of fun but it is so crowded. Early morning might be the best time because any time after 11am is a mad house.,bucketlistbook
40,Great Experience!,"I went here to see pacific park and enjoy the beach on a late afternoon in April. I was super excited to see this place, and it didn't disappoint me! Pacific Park was super fun, and I loved the ferris wheel. The rides were thrilling or basic (but fun), and we enjoyed the gorgeous sunset while in Pacific Park. The area is overall nice, and there were friendly people there. The beach was amazing too.It was a bit crowded, but enough to handle. But I did not regret going here, in fact I am very glad I got to see this place. Overall, it was a good experience, and I do recommend going here, but it is crowded sometimes, so be sure to keep an eye on children.I hope this review is helpful. Be sure to ask questions!",m.b
30,Very crowded but worth seeing,"My friend and I spent about 45 minutes total on the pier. It is very crowded and hard to walk around on because there are so many people. We ended up going to the amusement park and riding the ferris wheel, which gave us a fantastic view of the sunset and the ocean. Just be prepared to bump into lots of people.",hmill42894
30,A bit tacky,"Worth a visit, but it was so busy that we preferred just strolling along the promenade and taking in the view",Joe L
30,Very crowded and ppl don’t care you’re pushing a stroller,"It’s a popular place I get that but ppl aren’t mindful that you’re pushing a stroller. Cutting in front of you, when you say “excuse me” they just look at you like “you want me to move.” I’ve been before without children and it was alright, don’t understand the big hype.The ocean area itself was good, we’d walked down under the shaded area since the sand was so hot and the kids enjoyed themselves in the water for awhile.",PlaytimewithMiss_T_e
50,Highlight of our trip to CA,"Loved the atmosphere here. Had a great time, ver safe - fun riding the roller coaster. Ate at Bubba Gump, very good food. Good purchases of T-shirts",Laurie B
50,Keep your memories @ The Pier Santa Monica,I love this place and it gives me a real positive energy. It is not our first time and I hope it will not be the last.Enjoy your time there specially in the early morning or @ sunset.Have a meal or a drink there :) enjoy your time.,Sameh Elsheikh
50,A Pleasant time at the Pier,"The pier has a great selection of activities and restaurants which to enjoy, along with a number of iconic sights to see. It is a great place to walk around, people watch, or grab something tasty.",Karen R.
40,Crazily busy,"If you are fancying a nice quiet stroll down the pier then this is not the place for you, this place is loud, lively and totally buzzing with atmosphere whether it’s night or day.Personally don’t see how you could visit Santa Monica and not go on the pier. In terms of cost you have to remember that this is a tourist hot spot and the prices reflect this I would suggest parking away from the pier and walking in. The hustle and bustle and diversity of live entertainment itself provides you with plenty of opportunity to soak up the ambience, there’s magicians, artists, musicians, preachers amongst many.Couple of things to watch for are on approach to the pier are the scam artists with free CDs and people dressed in costumes offering to have their picture taken with you but then demanding money for this. The cost of the food on the pier is high but keep an eye for little places off the pier like Big Deans where the food is cheaper and far better quality.Make the most of the pier as it is a great source of entertainment, weekends in the summer you can’t really move and the road down to the pier is shut off by the local police.Enjoy people 👍",Pies
30,"Was ok, nothing special but worth a visit!","Visited here with my family do different really to the piers in the UK. Tourist shops, food, the usual nothing special to see. Beach is lovely though.",Nichola8
30,Expectations too high?,"there are so many homeless people here, so many hopeless camped out along the front of the pier it’s difficult to ignore their plight and just head on in, spend money frivolously and wastefully. I thought all of the dine in places were over priced, the street acts forced joviality with the entertainment on the low budget/high charging end. There are stunning photos that can be taken of the pier (give yourself a bit of distance and some dark), grab some street food from the vendors on the beach (real Mexicano) and get the kids a fun balloon.Parking is horrendous with looooong delays getting out so if you can wrangle it use some public transport or phone a friend!",Luvinspoonful
50,Touristy but a must do!,"Pretty at night but Busy! Go during the day, take a stroll, enjoy performers, water and hillside views, rides with kids, and vendors.",DunnTrips12
40,An hour is enough unless you have children,"I was there for maybe 40 minutes, it was more than enough for me. I would imagine that this would be a lot of fun with children but other than that it is a bit of a tourist trap.",AJICE
40,Great,A must when in la. Very large pier and very busy. Lots to see do and buy. Get your dollar water and churros from the little ladies on the walk up. Stunning veiws,Lisa B
30,"Dirty beach, huge crowds ,","Not a great place as the beach is very dirty , has lot of crowds & resembled a village fair . The roads are always full, difficult to get a taxi though electric scooters are available for rent. Nothing seemed great. Just an AVG place hyped up",Satish Medapati
30,depends,We were only there for a short time. Parking was $15 and it was already 4pm when we got there. the pier and the beach were quite busy. The longest line coming off the beach was to rinse off. was advised by a former LA resident to leave before dark. no obvious indication as to hy as of 5;45p but it wasn't dark. if you are looking to be by the beach with a ot of people on a hot evening this is the right place for you! Glad I went but not sure I would go back based on my preferences.,Kathleen D
10,"Don't visit, waste of time",There was nothing special about the pier and it was extremely touristy. There wasn't anything in particular to see and we came on a foggy day which made it even worse. Avoid.,Ryan M
50,Fun and scarves!,It's a nice stroll and there was a kiosk near the entrance where I bought several beautiful scarves and beach cover-ups.Heal the Bay was fun and interesting.This is a good way to spend a few hours on a sunny day.,JeannieTheCastigator
30,"Neat place, Rides are ridiculous prices for what they are","So we loved the pier for walking around and pictures, walk on the beach etc.... Neat view at night. You can grab a bite to eat. As far as rides I was a little floored. It was $8 a person to ride the boat ride... just the little boat that swings back and forth. We paid $28 for our 3 kids to ride that one cheesy ride for 1 minute. That sounds stupid ridiculous to me. Honestly think about it, by the time I bought them just 4 cheesy rides it would have paid for a Disney land ticket for all day unlimited good rides... luckily my kids didn’t find anything very interesting there they felt they needed to get on. The rides would be more exciting for a 10 and under age group I think. Everything else I did enjoy.",Patricia C
40,Something for everyone,"There is lots of parking. We paid $30 to park at a restaurant just off the pier but there are lots of options. There are many places to eat, from sit down restaurants to food trucks and snack stands. We ate at Bubba Gump’s and it was fantastic. We felt very safe so our teens stayed at the amusement park and did the rides which were quite pricey. We opted for the all you can ride bracelets. My husband and I strolled the pier and watched the buskers- some great singers and magicians. It was a great way to put in an evening- very iconic.",Anne L
40,Great family fun with basic facilities,"Santa Monica Pier and surrounding beach were lively and crowded. There were ample restaurants, shops, street performers and folks selling beach supplies and ice cream. The public bathroom facilities weren’t great and we didn’t find a changing area. There was only one spout to wash sand off after the beach so it had along line. Parking was a very close walk and $15. The spots were very narrow. The state needs to renovate all public facilities at the pier, but it still is a must visit.",Eric
40,Fun place to spend a few hours,"Crowded yes, expensive yes but it is the end of Route 66. Some good eats and fun for the kids. Worth an afternoon",heath2489
40,Great Day Out,"Fun to go people watch, take a ride on the ferris wheel. It is very tourist oriented but it was a fun few hours",jwatt28
50,Amazing pier with lot of fun activities to do,"Since we were visiting this place on 4th July 2019, there were throng of tourist. Great amusement park, we could enter for free. Since huge lines we didn't sit on any of the rides... locals were enjoying summer activities on the beach.. Metro station is at 15 mins walking distance",Wanderlust_Bhavna
50,A fun day!,"We visited the Santa Monica Pier and spent the day on the pier at Pacific Park (I did a separate review of the park). If you just wanted to attend the peir, I'd suggest going in the morning! On the day we went, it was crowded and more crowded as the day went on. We arrived early, about 9am, in order to go to the park ahead of the crowds and at the early hour it was far less populated and very calm.You can park directly on the pier in the morning, but we noted it was closed in the afternoon. Parking on the pier is $3.75/hour or a max of $18 for the day. We spent 7 hours on the pier and riding the rides at Pacific Park, so the $18 was well-spent for us. We were close to everything we needed and were able to return to our car several times for drinks and snacks in our cooler and save the money from buying those items at the ballpark style prices on the pier.The beach area looked wonderful! The bathrooms were plentiful and well-cleaned when we were there. Overall, it was a fun time for our family with young children.",briaj86
40,Worth a walk through but not what I expected.,"We were here in May 2019, it was worth walking through and it being free made it worth it but honestly, wasn't really anything special imo. I guess we were expecting something bigger, more grand but it was like 30 minutes to walk through or less and then done.",jcrann
50,Pacific Ocean feeling - the beach you saw in movies as a child,"Being Europeans and seeing many movies/series filmed in Santa Monica we were looking forward to visiting the area. The Pier indeed exceeded our expectations! It was our first time seeing the endless pacific ocean and it was magnificent! It is like the feeling you have when you reach Nordkapp in Norway, where Atlantic Ocean meets Arctic Ocean. Santa Monica’s Pier has a nice platform inside the sea were you feel like reaching the end of mainland and new adventures lie ahead. From the touristic point of view, there are many things to do and is friendly for pets and families with children. Even in winter it worth visiting!",Gerasimos D
30,Meh,"Visited this classic... hot, crowded, gross bathrooms. Beautiful old pier and views. Won't visit again.",traceyd555
30,Busy busy busy! Very commercialised,Wouldn’t return here. If your reading this in the uk..it’s a mix of Blackpool & Benidorm.Watch your purse! Rather smelly too,Caroline O
50,Santa Monica Pier is a must see.,"Amazing atmosphere, good music good vibe. Views are great. We will be happy to visit this Pier again.",Natalia Morari
30,OK,"This was a site I wanted to see at the end of our road trip. I was taken aback by the sheer crowds of people. Packed like sardines. A lot of homeless, tourists and pick pockets. Glad I saw it but I'll not revisit.",Feebee283
30,Just OK,"Santa Monica Pier was recommended to me and my husband by everyone we know, just because it’s essential that you have a stop at the pier if you’re visiting LA.Our personal experience was just ok, we had a good day: games, roller coaster, typical souvenir stores, places to eat (meh).Parking is full. It was overcrowded, full of tourists (of course, like us, but some people don’t like this). We didn’t like at all that the place felt dirty and smelled like marijuana! Homeless people all over the place asking for money. We wouldn’t recommend having babies in a stroller when you go to Santa Monica! Just because it is not something you’d want your babies to see, feels unsafe at times.If you’re okay with skipping this touristy spot, do it. You’ll only miss that typical photo in Santa Monica Pier, that’s all.",Silvi
40,Santa Monica Pier,"Located about 40 minutes from Downtown Los Angeles, parking here can be tricky and traffic can be heavy.",Rory James DOYLE
40,Seaside funfair,Busy buzzy bustling. Funfair on the pier. Lots of Market vendors. Interesting memorabilia at the End of Route 66. No visit to Santa Monica would be complete without a stroll down the pier.,jaynee
40,Ok but dated.,Worth a visit just to see the amount of people. Kids enjoyed it. Needs a bit of a refresh being honest.,Dominic1888
30,"OK, but crowded.","Santa Monica Pier is the end of Route 66. The pier is nice, but for me there are æmway too many people out there. If you are OK with that, go. If you prefer less crowded piers, I would recommend for instance Redondo Pier, which I liked better.",JKristian
50,A site beyond description,It was so amazing and eyecatching from outside. The big wheel and all the rides were fun. View of the sea was wonderful.,duttsupriya
50,3 day trip in LA,Santa Monica pier was more than expected with a lively atmosphere and immense energy. The sights were amazing.,Carol M
20,Whoa...,"Packed. Like. Sardines.There are too many people. No charm. Homeless and tourists smashed together. This icon must be seen, but come in the off season and have the place to yourself.",Rubten

40,Quite small and touristy,This was across the road from the hotel so worth a visit. Things are expensive her not good value for money but its a point on a walk that is worth visiting.,jonny5678
30,Beautiful view,"Very nice view, but so much people. Many small shops, mostly souvenirs. There is also a little tivoli. The Bubba Gump restaurant is a good choice for a meal.",kajsa234
50,Amazing place,"We loved our day in Santa Monica so sooo much. Yes it is touristy and pricey but there is no where else quite like it. You can spend the day on the beach swimming in the sea and rent bikes to ride up and down the sea front, visit Venice and then come back for an evening on the pier with the wheel all lit up and a great atmosphere. Would 100% do another day here.",Emily W
50,So Much Fun!!!!!!!!!!,"We had a blast on our visit to Santa Monica Pier. Definite must dos are ferris wheel, the scrambler, and check out the gift shops. One thing we did on the pier that was my favorite, was there was a stall with an oriental person who was painting your name. They charged only a $1 per letter and you could get a frame for $5 to protect it. Gorgeous and done within a short amount of time. Lovely to dip your toes in the ocean while you are visiting the pier.",Nicki T
40,"Wonderful shops, beach is a little dirty.","I stumbled upon Santa Monica after fleeing Venice Beach, yes I fled, quite quickly I may add from the filthy beach and homeless scene. Santa Monica is a gorgeous location. It is home to many clean, beautiful shops and eateries. It’s a much, much better place to take your family than some of California’s other beaches. If you want to take in a gorgeous view of California scenery, this is a good location to do it. Lush greenery, beaches, and a mountainous back drop make it a breathtaking view. There is still a homeless problem at this beach, but not on the level of several other beaches I had visited in the state. I think that California needs to do a lot better job of regulating this than they’re currently doing, but all and all, a nice location!",Taylor
30,Over priced and over populated,Went to the pier because that’s what your supposed to do when in Santa Monica. 30 minutes to find a parking spot then a mass of people. Would I go back? no,Dan L
40,Iconic & worth a stop,"If you’re in LA area with kids, this pier and beach are worth visiting. Prepare to pay to park, and be ready to pay $5-$10 per person per ride on the pier. Yummy food options such as the Japadog hotdog cart. Lots of people from all over the world. Big waves around the pier and some surfers. Walk a little ways down the beach to find a cleaner place to wade in the surf. We enjoyed the Ferris wheel; went around several times and had great views even on a foggy/smoggy day; it was $10 per person. We found it worth the drive out to Santa Monica (staying in Universal City).",MegSATX
50,Santa Monica Pier,Fist time visiting. It was amazing. Lots to do and see and the beach is beautiful. Plan to spend the day there. Lots of places to eat near the pier,sissypoo123

30,Much less than expected,"After flying in from Hawaii, we decided to play tourist and visit the pier until our hotel room became available. In short, I'd say that we weren't impressed. While there are plenty of games and rides for younger kids, there's not much for the adults other than shopping, food, and people watching. The beach is also an option, possibly the best option for the adults and the only reason I'd ever return.",Only1CochiseBrown
50,Always exciting!,"So much to see here! The beach, rides, restaurants, performers, people watching and more. There are public restrooms and a police station at the pier. It can get quite crowded in the evenings. Be sure to take your picture at the End of Route 66 sign. There is a large transient population - but no one was aggressive. Afterwards walk through the 3rd street promonade.",JD1

20,Not Impressed,"Spent the night in Santa Monica in a hotel right down from the Pier and after dinner we walked around. While now I can cross this off my bucket list, I have to say I was NOT impressed. It was run down and the night time crowd was pretty sketchy. We went back the next day and the crowd was much better. Overall Santa Monica was not my favorite place on our California trip. I wouldn't go back.",Wendy

You can have dinner on the pier, ride the Ferris wheel, or walk down by the beachThe food is good and you can also go to the nearest corner and rent the electric scooters to ride around the town. You can also walk the boardwalk from Santa Monica pier to Venice.",Anna
20,Overrated,"In my opinion, this is a nice long pier with a bunch of overpriced food and amusement on it but nothing worth making a special trip for. There are lots of options for food but nothing that really seemed unique. Of course, they have rides, but the lines were long and the rides were not. There were plenty of vendors selling photos, jewelry, and their homemade music CDs as well as panhandlers asking for donations. It was also really crowded with a lot of people that evidently never learned common courtesy. Is this place unique? Maybe, but not special in my book. Did my teenage son and I enjoy it, or would we ever go back? No. It’s certainly not worth dealing with all the traffic and people to say you’ve been there, but some people may feel otherwise.",JayBurgin72

There are rides, musicians, magicians, souvenir sellers and of course stalls with food items for kids and tourists to enjoy. However, after dusk the crowd may disappear and one may enjoy the place. There are a number of restaurants to enjoy.",Royadip
40,Nice family visit,"The girls enjoyed the rides and we enjoyed just walking around. The line to the bathroom was very long so we pretended we were eating at Bubba Gump and went there, where the line wasn’t near as long. There are a good many homeless in the area.",uscfan1325
50,You just gotta go when in LA!,Lots to do! Plan to spend a 1/2 day if you go here. Eat and play! Take a picture by the route 66 sign and buy a pass to Pacific Park.,MarthaWK
50,Must Visit the icon!,"Santa Monica Pier is a plus travel list, with nice restaurants Lobster and Marisol to choose from as well as fast food. The Arcade is fun for yourself or kids, or you can ride the merry-go-round, but there’s plenty to see and do on the pier.",Eric C
30,To much tourist nothing special to see,İt was very populated there and it was very loud you can go there if its on your wat but dont go extra cause its nothing special.,Yasemin Y
30,Buzzing with activity (and a cacophony of noise),I went on a Thursday afternoon and the place was heaving with people who were mostly milling around it seemed. Several buskers tried to out-sing each other creating a cacophony of noise that made it unbearable to sit for too long. And the restaurants are a rip off! It's better to find a place to eat at Santa Monica Place.,Faizel L
40,Told this was a must do....hmmm not sure I agree,We went during the day. It was very windy and crowded. Lines were long and the restroom we used was Bubba Gump.I think it would be neat at night. However not sure how safe. We took photos and left. Hmmm one more off the bucket list. Been there done that. Not sure I would ever return.,Baybug2012
30,"Ok we saw it, eh","We were here at night so I’m sure it’s a different experience but it was just ok. Obviously a huge tourist so everything was crazy expensive and crowded. Lots of performers which was interesting. Amusement park is on the pier but looked fun. We hit some shops and had burgers, etc but overall it’s not anything we’d need to see again. It was cool putting our feet in the Pacific after starting the morning with our feet in the Atlantic!",Mike S
50,A lovely stroll,"I came back to Santa Monica many years after first visiting with my family, this time alone for work. So strolling along Santa Monica pier was a big nostalgia moment and so I enjoyed taking a long slow stroll up and down the pier. It’s all a bit cheesy but that just adds to the charm. A must visit when in town.",mikeyonhols
30,It’s what you expect it to be !,"The Santa Monica pier! , lots of people wanting to get your money! But that’s what it should be. An iconic site, a must see and experience at night.People from all over the world gathering together for junk food and good fun.Wear comfortable shoes, prepare to do some walking. Crowded, noisy, incredibly diverse and multi cultural.",imagemaker1
50,Nice place to chill out.,Nice place to chill out for lunch a bit of shopping. Would be great place to take kids as it has all the basic amusement park rides. Walkable distance to venice beach too.,Carl W
30,"Crowded, dirty & expensive",I have heard of this landmark for most of my life & was excited to visit but was disappointed. Very crowded and dirty. They could do a much better job of keeping it clean. Two tickets for the Ferris wheel was 20.00,EG54
40,Rides are pricey but view from ferris wheel was worth it,"We had our Lyft driver drop us off at the Pier after the US women won the semi final world cup soccer game. We were in good spirits. The kids wanted to ride the ferris wheel and roller coaster. It's a bit steep at $10 each, but they didn't want to ride more so we skipped the $35 unlimited ride bracelet. I decided to ride the ferris wheel with them. They were annoyed at me but it was nice to take some pics of them and the view of the beach was really neat to see. I skipped the coaster which they said was so boring. Their favorite thing to do was just past the pier and swing on the rings and climb the ropes and that cost me $0. We then leisurely walked back to Venice Beach which is 3 miles and a good hour if you walk it straight, but we stopped for drinks and snacks along the way so it didn't seem so long.",carrie9678
30,Over crowded,"Street hawkers, people over people, no place tj walk, sit, move, despite being sea side I didn't get a good feeling while being here",Rahul K
30,Early morning of peace,"While we were there quite early on a Monday the pier is starting to look quite tired & worn, as evidenced by the large amount of workmen there. At least we can say we’ve been now",Scot P
30,Kinda a dumpster fire...,"OK, so it's the end of Route 66, it's the Pacific Ocean, it's an iconic location...but there are so many other piers that offer much better options. Be original and get out and find them! You'll thank us.",Clan Bacon
40,Nice beach/Pier,"Visited here for a few hours- nice beach and pier. Rides for young kids, restaurants and vendors. Beach was crowded but we were there around July 4 so to be expected. Overall it was clean. Would come here again.",tppenn
50,Great place to people watch,We took a walk down to the pier to check it out. There are multiple gift shops and eateries. It’s busy with people but a must see if you’re in the area. Amusement park looked fun and be sure to take a ride on the merry-go-round. It’s so cool. Park up top or park at the beach. Fun couple of hours can be spent there.,Allison C
40,A family night out!,We popped down to the pier for their fun park with my six year old godson. We had a great night - the unlimited rides was $35USD which gave us endless turns on whichever rides we pleased. The roller coaster is great fun and the Ferris Wheel is a must!There’s plenty of food options down here too. There were also hardly any queues for the rides and most of the time we jumped straight on!,Eden C
50,Loved it!,"This is also a must do for me! Who doesn’t want to see the famed pier, the end of Route 66? Went on July 4th so it was busy but still walked out on the pier, great views, soaked up the sun and food. Parking nearby ended up only being about $3 for our 3 hour stay. Great.",Neelam95
40,Walk on Pier,Got to beach via hop on hop off bus. Took about 30 mins from Beverley Gardens Park. Lovely views of beaches and hills. Pier itself not overly busy on a Saturday. Had LA card which covers entry into Pacific Park - teenager too old. Spent a short time in the Heal The Bay aquarium. Very small - good to see the good work being done. Again more suited to younger children where they can touch various fish. Venice beach a real let down after Santa Monica.,Aidene W
50,Lots to do to keep you entertained!,Spent a good bit of time in the arcade but also enjoyed the views from the pier and grabbing some great shots of the family!,DizTravelMom
50,Great day at the beach,We walked from Venice to here along the boardwalk. Great views and dipped our feet in the ocean.The Pier is such good fun. Buy a day pass if you want to do lots of rides as it is better value.The Pacific wheel gives great views in both directions.Well worth a visit.,Icefairy
40,Fun for a Quick Walk Through,"Being downtown in Santa Monica, we felt obligated to see what the pier was like. Very accessible, not too crowded at the time we were there (about 6pm Saturday), plenty of food stands and souvenir shops. Didn't need to use the rest room, but it looked like the lines were pretty long. I didn't see the condition of the restroom, but it obviously had heavy use. Overall, go see it if you're in town, but don't plan a trip around it.",Jon M
40,Take the kids...and your wallet,Definitely need to go see (especially with the kids). A little pricey and super crowded but you should at least go and see the pier. Great photos and the beach is really nice too.,angie r
50,4th July..A lot of talent on the pier,"Went to America early to see 4th of July celebrations on my way home to Australia. Lots of entertainment, great hot dogs! Great artists. But where was the local fireworks?? Had to watch it along the coast line so no great fireworks photo opportunities. Need more rubbish bins so people don't continue to throw rubbish over pier. And stop allowing plastic straws in all your stores. I picked up heaps of plastic ones.",Boobs68
50,Super Fun at the Sta Monica Pier,We visited this place sometime in June 2019. We got there at about 6PM. They have a lot of fun games and rides. Plenty of food choices too. Make sure to bring your jacket if you plan to visit. It gets really cold with the cool breeze coming from the sea.,Mariel T
50,Great place to visit,"Great place to visit with your family. To many things to do, see and eat. Best churros. You could see the end of trail of Route 66. It was a great evening.",Rebeccamendoza25
30,"If you are going to the beach , stay away from the Pier!","Pier is nice to take a walk and get some nice pictures . It’s usually crowded , but it is still fun.But if you are going to the beach , drive a mile and reach the beach out of the crowds . There are plenty of beach access with public restrooms near , if you go past the volleyball courses , you will get a nicer , less crappy - crowded spot.",Jaime Himes
30,Busy day - lots of hustling,"We went for a stroll up and down the pier. it was a beautiful day and the crowds were out. After we had patiently queued to park the car, we set off.The pier is flanked by not-so-special restaurants. There were 3 musicians and 2 dance acts hoping to draw dollars from our pockets: most of them hopeless. Their loud noise just made us feel hurried, hassled and unsafe.At the end if the pier, watching the fisherman reel in their catch as a seal happily swam in the pacific, was a real treat though.",JimTerryIV
50,Day Trip,"Since our plane arrived mid morning, we decided to drive to Santa Monica Pier to spend the day on our way to Woodland Hills, CA. We got there about 10am. Parking was abundant, very easy and reasonably priced. We walked the boardwalk, enjoyed the ocean breeze, and took pictures. Husband fished off the pier with no success. But he had fun. Rental prices for fishing were high considering all you got was a pole and bait. But like any touristy location, it was expected. Rode the ferris wheel and carousel. Best part of Santa Monica Pier was Pier Burger -- best burger ever! But that's another review!",Chrisbry
30,A must and still a tourist trap,"Most have seen the pier in one of the many movies where it is a well know sight.Crowded, full of people trying to sell crap to you and of course expensive compared to quality. In other words a real tourist trap, but you will walk around it quickly and can then head towards the much nicer Venice beach.",Reijo B
50,Enjoyable,Excellent place to hang out. Beautiful sunset. Plenty of places to walk and grab a bite to eat and shopping!!,sonyal979
40,Great view.,"We were visiting our son who lives in LA and he brought us here as he was showing us all the highlights spots. Parking was $15 or $16 for all day. There are a lot of shops, food, souvenirs, etc on the pier. We did put our feet in the water as there is a lot of beach area here. It would be nice to just come and hang out on the beach with a couple of chairs and a cooler. There is an aquarium under the pier but it didn't open until 2 pm on Tuesday so we did not get to go in. We did walk the 2 miles down to Venice. It is a nice wide sidewalk to walk on with room for scooters, bikes etc. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the pier. (Christa)",davidjensen399
30,Would not go here as a destination day trip,There were a lot of typical pier/boardwalk type of activities on the pier but it wasn't very well kept and seemed kind of run down to us. There are plenty of public restrooms. Parking was $14/day in the public parking lots. Santa Monica town was a few blocks away and seemed like a nothing-special town; again wouldn't come back here for a destination visit.,Michael S
50,tourists,Enjoyed seeing this landmark from a distance. Illuminated at night especially the ferris wheel.Easily walked there from our accommodation in Venice Beach.Great for children. Lots of rides to choose from.Also had multiple eateries from stalls to sit down restaurants,Ausberg
50,The best if you love the ocean!!!,"Taking a walk on the pier was a wonderful experience. You have a little bit of everything. First of all, you see people from all over the world while enjoying the different musicians, drummers, piano players, erhu players, and singers. Food? You name it!! Tamales, churros, hot dogs, pizza, the best hamburger and fries!! And a bunch of fun people and families. All while you sit at one of the benches and enjoy the sound of the ocean, and the breeze caressing your face. Love it!! A must go to.",Blanca J
30,Obligatory stop!,"We decided to stop here since we were in the area. Getting in and parking we’re pretty easy. The pier itself was pretty busy and crowded. We stopped at a couple shops. I would recommend using cash. There are a few performers on the pier and you can fish. There was someone at the end of the pier selling dead fish to feed to a sea lion. We didn’t stop at the amusement park. When we left, getting out of the parking lot took a very long time. It’s a good place to stop to say you did.",Michelle S
30,Mini Blackpool Pier,This is a small Pier with places to eat and drink. It has those selling their souvenirs or entertaining.Nice to see but really nothing special and better when lit up at night but can get very busy especially at weekends.,johnmG8857TP
30,Must visit but ok,Suppose one of those must-visit attractions. Nothing very special. Good to say been-there-done-that.,Grant W
30,Good to Go? Yes and No.,"Because it’s a landmark, you need to visit. Both daytime and nighttime the pier is alive and hopping. Plenty to do once, although twice may be too much for teens and older. Just like Atlantic City or Wildwood in NJ, it has its charm,But too much of a good thing is not a good thing. Don’t over stay.",Rick D
40,Great walk,Lots to see and buy and eat.......performers delivering music and magic. Choice of food stalls or restaurants. Difficultly in getting vegetarian selections in restaurants on pier....out of stock. Cheesecake Factory fitted our needs better as a group of 7 but enjoyed ice cream on pier. Watched the seals off the end of the pier.,KayG
40,Love the pier & promenade street,"So many shops to browse & place to eat on the 3rd promenade street.Very touristy though...The pier is pretty but very crowded.Evening might be a better option for viewing the pier because weather get cool down..Also, it's really fun to hang out at the Arcade.",Amazing Lucca
40,Nice LA landmark but crowded,Ive been here before but its the first time i have been able to really enjoy the area since we stayed in a hotel close by. This is a go to place for anybody visiting LA. There are plenty of restaurants and shops along the pier. There are kiddie rides for the young ones. They also have an aquarium below the pier. Nice scenic view for phot op. There is parking on the pier. It just way too crowded for me especially in the late afternoon. You can also walk or bike along the boardwalk. I see there are public bathrooms and showers along the beach if you plan on swimming.,Gee Selle
40,Tourist Trap but fun,"Lots to do. Many gift shops, restaurants, arcade, and crazies. Keep in mind your at a tourist trap and it will be fun. It is also ""End of the Trail"" of Route 66!",87vette
40,"Cool, but busy.","The pier is cool - mostly for younger kids (in my opinion). It might be cool to eat at the restaurants for dinner, though we never did. The pier is very crowded, so we found going early morning the best time to visit. The street performers we saw just before the pier were pretty cool to watch (though they do it trying to earn money). There are several different acts, worth taking a look at, versus just walking away. Some are more drawn out than others. The beach around the pier is nice. There is a large homeless population, though we never encountered any issues. The 3rd street promenade is close and I wish we'd scheduled more time to look around there.",ShannonNeedsSun
50,Walk from Venice to SM,I walked from Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier and it was a great walk! You see the skateboarders and the muscle gym.,Kaitlyn K
40,Worth a look but very busy,"Our second time to Santa Monica, both times in summer and both times large crowds of people. Lots to see but expensive to do anything. We walked to Venice beach which is a real highlight.",kevjmurph76
50,One of the most iconic site of California,"Looking for some food, or browsing in the stores or just admiring the sunset? Does'nt matter, the pier will enchant you for sure. A lot of people, but not too many, so you feel comfortable, and impressed by the site",Antal Solyom
50,A must visit for all...,"Santa Monica is always my to-go place when I visit the Los Angeles area. There are many beaches that I have spent time at throughout the years, but I have always held a soft spot for the Santa Monica beach.",Mariah H
50,very enjoyable,Went down to the pier several times to have a meal great time had there had morning tea at Bubba Gump Shrimp didnt get achance for a meal,Maureen M
50,Beautiful at night,"Walked all over the boardwalk with my boyfriend, it was so pretty. Superrrrr crowded though, especially because it’s the week of 4th of July. But I’m hoping to catch the fireworks!",lakeishamason
50,Just like GTA,"My son has been dying to come here and go on the Ferris wheel and roller coaster even since seeing it on his PS4 game GTA. And he wasn’t disappointed, especially as the sun was high in the sky.",Doffa
40,"Been there, done that","If you find touristtraps appealing, its a must. But still, Nice view and its kind of epic to be here when in LA",Tmum45
50,The End of Route 66!,"A really fun place to shop, people watch, and see buskers perform! Fun shops and a Ferris wheel, and great fishing. Come at night and watch the Ferris wheel change colors!",Joseph J
50,So much fun!,"Great place for people watching! Lots of snack options, small shops and carnival rides. Very fun, very ""California""! Arrive early and beat the crowds - enjoy the pier and get pictures of the beautiful views without having to crop the tourists out of your pictures. Definitely spend the money to go on the ferris wheel! It's awesome!",LocalTourist85
30,So crowded,"I think it would have been a good experience except that it was so very crowded. We went on a Saturday night, which was probably a bad decision on our part. The sunset was beautiful, the hot chocolate was good, the rides were expensive at $10 each.",JohnsGirl87
50,"People watching, rides and SM history!","Can’t beat going to SM Pier and watching the rides, visiting vendors, being entertained by the musicians, many food/drink options. Iconic!!",Rachael
40,Good for a look around - lots to see,"I really enjoyed having a good look around the pier, there is always people busking, lots of little outdoor shops to browse around, of course the restaurants including bubba gump.There is the entertainment park with ferris wheel, roller coaster etc which is good for children.Lots of people fishing off the end of the pier, catching some fish as well.Great view over to the beach, and it looks great at night time as well with all of the lights.Well worth a visit, even though it is busy",danjonelson
50,Great Day Out,"This place was really alive! It had a great vibe - busy, lots of food outlets, lots of entertainment, some shopping, and.... BEACH! Family-focussed, this iconic location was a really fun place to spend a couple of hours.",Trisha G
50,Fun People Watching,"We spent the day in and around the Pier area — a very happy place with friendly people! We were very impressed with how many activities were available, and the diversity with them, and really enjoyed the street performers. Great job Santa Monica!",Blavincoo
40,"Lots to eat, see and do","A good place to stay cool and spend a few hours seeing the crowds, tasting different foods, even chance to get on some rides like the Ferris wheel.",Dave S
50,Great memory for our family!,"Visited the Pier with my family on our vacation to California. Kids loved every single second of it. Music, rides, beach views, and good food. A must do in Santa Monica!",Chase Brandon C

50,Best beach and waves fir kids in Cali.,"Nice wide beach! Great pier, public restroom and showers were plentiful.Water was a great temp in June. Very refreshing with the 80 degree temps. Sand was hot, tons of trash cans and NO SEAGULLS OR OTHER BIRDS.Nice fruit vendors and cold drinks all over!",6Wallys
50,Cali vibe's,You have the beach to your left and water on your right as you walk up to the amazing Pier. The shops food and people watching is just as fun as the Ferris wheel. You feel the Cali vibe immediately.,idayne
50,A Beautiful must see,I was expecting to be wowed and I was. The beach is so beautiful and the walk on the pier was relaxing. There are shops and restaurants on the pier and also kiosks set up. People were fishing and there are places to sit and just enjoys the cool breeze and the view.,Kimberly D
40,A must visit in LA,"The pier lies at the western end of Sta Monica Blvd and is also the end of historic Route 66. You can forego Venice beach if you're short on time, but not Sta Monica pier. Make sure to stay around for sunset as the backdrop of the Malibu hills presents a dramatic effect. While you're at it, take a dip at the beach as well.",eric821
50,Touristy but great,"The Santa Monica Pier is classic, very picturesque, and really fun. There is a lot of tourists in the evening but if you go right when it opens at 11 there will be hardly any people. The rides look overpriced but are actually really long and a lot more fun than they look. The food options are also very good. Make sure you get a Lifeguard Tank!!! ;)",Sophie D
40,Great for kids / families,"Our son loves the merry-go-round, there is a small aquarium nearby, and the arcade has rides for toddlers (put in a quarter to go on a little car or motorcycle that bops up and down.) The ski ball is also a fun classic. Only downside is how crowded it can get, so mornings are best. Gets crowded with tourists, but even more so in the summer.",Luika
30,"pretty trashy, good for kids",standard tacky overly busy seaside affair with a small selection of rides for kids and a games arcade. It's worth walking down to the end of the pier to spot wild seals poking their heads out the water.It's a nice walk from here to venice beach and worth going for a swim in the waves :),Sophie C
30,Meh,We headed to the coast after a college tour. This was our first stop. It was mid-day in a weekday so not too crowded - but it was dirty and junky - not too impressive. We paid $14 to park and another $6 for arcade games and spent an hour or two there. I would not put it on a must see list by any stretch,deebk
30,Super BUSY!,We went in the evening to check out the Pier. The water was cold so we did not get to swim. We ended up spending more time in the shopping mall area that is within walking distance than we did the pier itself. Plan on having patience to get to the parking lot! We spend approx 15-30 minutes just getting down the street to park!,Missy R
20,Underwhelming,"We visited on a weekday in June. It wasn’t crowded and not much was happening on the pier. There really are not many stands or stores to shop at and the ones there are trashy. There were a couple of restaurants but we had just eaten breakfast. Our girls I guess have outgrown the arcade and the rides appeal to younger kids. It was cloudy and hazy so the views weren’t great and we weren’t there to spend time on the beach, which did look great. We walked to the end of the pier, and turned around and walked back toward town. I guess we expected something more.",Jbeetles
40,Fun Pier,"Lots of activities, and a great place to people watch and soak in the California sun. On the weekends great free stuff tents. Great way to spend 1 or 2 hours of your day in Cali.",Kenny
40,Fun night on the Pier,"Second time at the Pier. Love it lights at night. Girls had fun on the rides. Seems that some changes were made from the last time, a little disappointing.",Adventurer611072
30,If you can suffer the crowds...,"This is mostly a mediocre deal until you get to the end of the pier, where you have a beautiful perspective on the shore. Skip the midway crap and rides and BS.",Zachary Matz
50,Lots going on,"Whether you want to play in the water, hop on a ride on the pier, fish, or grab food, you have all the options. Good arcade with plenty of normal games and lots of entertainers on the pier also.",Keith T
40,Overall a good experience,"My visit to the pier was a very good experience. I visited with my children ages 19, 17 and 9. Parking was very reasonably priced. I do advise that if you plan on riding rides you do pay for the bracelets to ride all day regardless of whether or not you plan on staying there all day. On average it was $8 a person to ride 1 ride.",Christina C
30,Iconic must do,This is an iconic must do when visiting Los Ángeles. We’ve gone every time but as my kids have gotten older they have expressed that the rides are “Lame” and the midway games boring. Our entire visit lasted less than an hour. This was an add on to our visit at the last minute because we had a free day. Now I regret having wasted the hour.,Choosewhatever
10,Small and overcrowded,"I was really excited to check out the Santa Monica Pier, as it is highly recommended by most tour books and blogs. However, I found it overcrowded and underwhelming. There are much better things to do while in Santa Monica!",Erin B
30,Stroll,The beach is huge an the rides were fun for the kids. The amount of homeless people let this place down though. Very sad to see.,Mani
40,Great people watching.,We had a few hours so we made our way to the pier. It is an iconic landmark after all. We didn’t ride anything but did enjoy our stroll looking at the Street vendors.,Jennifer D
40,Lots to do.,We enjoy the Pier and boardwalk. We enjoy the games and boardwalk foods. The rides are for smaller kids. The beach is clean and well protected. My girls enjoyed all the exercising equipment in the area.,ColbyHannah
40,End of the Trail of Route 66,Great place to visit while in Los Angeles. The Santa Monica pier is the end of the famous route 66 - once upon a time the mother road of the US from Chicago to Los Angeles and made famous in a song by the same name.There is also an amusement park on the pier called Paradise Park. Lots of fun for children and adults alike.Plenty of restaurants line the place.Near the famous muscle beach of yore. Great place to swim in the pacific.Amazing sunset view!,lachmanbalani

30,Overrated and super touristy.,"Santa Monica Pier is perhaps the most well known beach location in the LA area, but it’s way too touristy for my liking. It’s packed to the brim with European tourists and US tourists. If you want an authentic LA beach experience, try Venice and Manhattan Beaches.",Nathan Smith Jr
50,Loved the Pier,"We spent six days in Santa Monica and had a number of visits to the Pier. Always something happening- entertainers, people ready for a friendly chat, and some great food places. A great atmosphere and easy to recommend a visit or two to this pier. Loved our time here.",Marie MAC
50,So LA,One of those places you just have to do to experience all we think LA is. Go in the evening for the sunset and then stay to get the feeling under the lights.,MarkAndCathy
40,It really is a must when in Santa Monica,My first full day in Santa Monica and visiting the peer really is a must. A nice easy walk with lots to see and a really chilled atmosphere.,VMP28
40,People Watching Pier,"Parking can be a hassle, so if possible take public transportation or try to visit at an off time. Great people watching, food and fun. You never know what you'll see--from Hare Krishna singers to Ray Charles imitators. And then there are the rides and attractions. On top of all that, it's a historical site, and also features the natural end of the famous Route 66 (take a selfie with the sign denoting the end of the road). Short walking distance to the Third Street Promenade, a pedestrian mall which features a lot of dining options.",Jim T
50,Santa Monica Pier,It is an experience to not miss while in Santa Monica. The lights and busyness is fun!! The entertainment to take part in is such a variety there will be something for everyone.,TonyanDaryl K
50,Such a FUN Time!,"I thought the crowds would damper the fun, but not a chance! This was such a neat area. The roller coaster is simple but fun, and the Ferris wheel is a classic! I'd love to bring my kids here someday!",Mom2Twincesses
30,Good for small kids,"Nice walk down onto the pier, commercialised as you would expect and prefers to suit young children for the rides and attractions. Great little ‘nick nacks’ to buy in the end of the pier R66 shop.All in was a good place to visit but suits younger children and looking very dated.",Andy
50,A fun place to visit,"Stopped just for a few hours, but really enjoyed the visit. We didn’t take the time for the rides, just the street(pier) performers, the shops and the beach. You must stop if you’re in the area.",Donald S
30,Ride the Ferris wheel,"The Ferris wheel is awesome. You get a great view of the area from all sides. I like it better during the day than in the evening. The rest of the pier is really like a carnival with games, rides and fast food. Busy with tourists and pretty cheesy.",DHHWWH

50,Beautiful day beautiful place...,"From the airport took the Metro Rail. The Metro Rail will take you almost right to the Santa Monica Pier.(app. 8 min. walk). Great place to shop, go on rides, walk on the beach, look @ the ocean & enjoy the free entertainment. Had a wonderful day here.",L Philippsen
30,Way better in photos,I guess is a “must see” but it looks way batter in photos than reality. Plenty of homeless and other beggars everywhere. Not a lot of options for eating. Prices for “not-so-great” rides are excessive. I liked the street performers.,Angel O
20,Pile of Pier!,"Yuck! This tourist trap gets so much attention since it sounds appetizing. In reality, it’s a dirty, small wooden pier with a handful of carnival rides and really bad food.Skip the pier for a Southern California beach day and head to Malibu instead. This pier is the pits!",TRVLtruth
40,Beautiful place to explore ...,"Santa Monica is really a beautiful place to explore - can be pretty busy and crowded - lots of opportunities to sit in and dine & wine - good for families, couples and singles",PlatinumForeverDUS
30,Nothing special,Came for a look as was spending day at nearby Venice beach. Basically a pier with some rides and food stalls. Probably better for kids and young families. Got a funnel cake and it was terrible - and cost nearly $10!,joekerr23
50,Great old fashioned fun,"Easy to spend half a day on the pier with lots of restaurants, old fashioned funfair, street entertainment and shops.",SteveRDay
30,Quick Stop for a few photos,This was first on our list of stops from leaving LA to head up the coast to San Francisco. Messed up and parked a few blocks away in a parking garage when we could’ve parked right at the pier. Good views and had a lil food. Be good place for kids with the rides and food.,Tommy P
50,Vibrant and buzzing,"A cacophony of colour, noise and smells. People from all walks of life having fun. Rides, candy floss, popcorn and all manner of fast food.There is a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster and other rides. Great for kids and a nice atmosphere.",Sudo62
30,It’s a pier with the usual hawkers and so on,"Has a world famous name and small funfair, otherwise it’s simply another pier. The main attraction are the coastline and beach views. Glad I’ve seen now it but it’s not massively memorable.",Craig R
50,Santa Monica Pier roller coaster ferris wheel,Very busy packed full of people worth a visit we were limited for time so didn't stay will be going back to experience another time,Nichole R
50,it was very beautiful,The beach was very beautiful.There were so many nice people .The fruits were very tasty.The street performers and the performer at the pier were amazing,blujizzle
40,Fun for Families!,"The Santa Monica Pier is a very busy, arcade, rides, food, shops, and people-watching hotspot. Prices are not inexpensive but it is Santa Monica. There are things to do for everyone from little ones to seniors. There is parking on the pier but it fills very rapidly. However, there is good and convenient indoor parking right across the street in The Ocean parking garage. Staff there was friendly and price was reasonable. There is a steep slope from the street down to the pier itself so please bear this in mind if you are disabled as am I. I managed but it was a bit awkward and people were prone to push to get past me. Once you reach the pier itself, things widen out and it’s more manageable. There are a bunch of arcade gaming places and several rides (roller coaster, Ferris wheel, antique merry-go-round, some other whirl you, spin you rides for the more adventurous. Hip hop and breakdancers off to the side, pushcarts with popcorn and cotton candy and the like, and a lot of shops selling the usual tourist fare. There are a nice selection of restaurants (see my review of my favorite, The Albright) and some tasty homemade ice cream on the pier. The view of the beach and particularly, the ocean, is beautiful. It is crowded so plan accordingly but I enjoyed my visit and would recommend it, especially to families.",LoriJMK
50,A Good Memory,We went to this place in a tour on Memorial Day. Lot a people their. Very good memory of a place where movies had been filmed.,sheyssa
50,pretty cool place,my son was very happy with all the attractions and the food could be a whole month there without stopping to go a single day because the whole environment is friendly,rodneybangalters
50,Fun and vibrant,We went on a relatively cool day and really enjoyed it. There's lots of energy and people having fun. We did not do any activities but there are lots of amusement park rides and games. We had no trouble finding parking. The area was pretty clean and well maintained. There are public RR as well.,Lisa G
50,Looff Carousel is a Must! Lots of Photo Ops! End of Route 66,"Park right on the pier. The Looff carousel is an absolute must. It's a classic by the most realistic carver of the golden age of carousels. There is a pig and a goat in addition to all the horses. The tilt-a-whirl cars are shark mouths, which is cute. Make sure to look at the old photos and read all the history - this is the inspiration for Popeye. Lots of places to eat. This was plenty of fun.",Susan K
50,"Very nice place to visit,",Its a nice place to visit. Little bit over crowded but a must go. The weather was good so I enjoyed a lot.,Chandan Omkar
30,It’s Ok,Came here to visit while in town. Obviously very touristy with loads of people. Many restaurants fast food and sit down. Several rides and games as well. I guess you have to walk the pier since you see it on tv so much.,Nailcutter
30,End of Route 66,"This large pier with food places and a large old style theme park, is nothing amazing. Probably just a good location to say they you made it to Santa Monica beach. Route 66 finishes here and there is a small display about it.",Aussie_2012
10,One of the sketchiest places on earth,I’ve been looking forward to seeing this pier for months and man can I say I’ve never been more disappointed in something. This place is horrible. More crowded than a Disney park. Never felt so unsafe walking somewhere. Everywhere you looked people were just smoking weed. This is definitely not a place I would ever take a kid.,thomas a
50,Very good indeed,"Fantastic place, lively and great atmosphere the rides are for everyone and not too scary but definitely lots of fun.",Dean-kate
40,Just a fun place You can get everything in Santa Monoca,"Good fun, a place for tourists or locals, when you don't want to play Disneyland prices. Sea food, desserts etc.",L ..
40,My second visit,I went with my son. It was his first time and my second time. The first time I went was in November 2011. June is NOT the month to go. It was extremely crowded. Lots to see and do. Next time we will go when school is in session. This is my sons last year in high school coming up. So no restrictions on our traveling plans after that. Try those French Fries across the street. DELICIOUS 🥳 #ILoveLA,Coils
40,Always fun but wheelchair be aware.,Santa Monica pier is one of my happy places! First time visiting while in a wheelchair and getting to the pier attractions is possible but very steep- wouldn’t recommend in a manual wheelchair without an attendant - going down was hard to control even in a power chair and coming back up would be near impossible in a manual. There was no way to access the beach from the pier without steps.,kamikidd
20,Holiday,I found the Santa Monica Pier to be very uninspiring. The huge carpark in front of the pier really detracted from the area. There were numerous attractions on the pier with eating outlets etc but having always wanting to visit there if I went to America I was very underwhelmed!,Peter D
40,Nice Place for a Stroll,"This place is a nice place to finish your stroll along Santa Monica beach, a bit touristy of course but nice views and some really good buskers playing some jazz or blues, go to the end for some nice Mexican food.",Frances V
50,Fun times for all!,"This place is awesome! I’ve been to California many many times and never got to hit the pier. The place was packed! My hubby and I walked the entire thing and then decided to have some fun. We got some passes to ride the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel. We had a blast like we were 13 again hahah. The coaster is small but has food turns and dips. Plus, they run it twice so it’s not as short. The Ferris wheel is such a beautiful sight. No matter which way you sit, you have views of the ocean and the beach, plus some city views. It was pretty cold the week we were there surprisingly, but it was beautiful and refreshing.There are a lot of kids there and families so patience is KEY. It’s as packed as any amusement park so be ready for that. All in all we had a good rime and the boardwalk itself is clean and great to take pictures with friends or family.",Nikitha Maccherone
40,"A ""tourist trap,"" but a fun one","Nothing on the pier is much different than what you'd find at any American beachside resort, but it's clean and well maintained. And it is the ""end of the road"" of the old Route 66, so fans of the historic highway will especially want to make it a stop.",CareyMartin
50,Great old Santa Monica attraction,Take a walk down an authentic wooden pier. Ride a carousel or a kids roller coaster. Try your luck at arcade games or grab some great food at Bubba Gump’s. There’s a very good Mexican restaurant at the end of the pier. A fun day and always beautiful to be by the sea.,jerry k
50,Beautiful!,Loved it here! Anyone that watched Three's Company will appreciate visiting the pier. It was just as beautiful as I imagined it to be!,Quest630575
30,Another L.A. sight.,Glad we went just to say we've been but apart from the carousel and big wheel it's another L.A. commercial tourist sight.,Karen W
30,Too crowded,It is just another commercialised place. It was very crowded. It was very windy when we visited this place.,MaithiliSave
40,"Busy pier, cloudy and misty evening","We walked down onto the pier on our first night here - the weather wasn’t great, cloudy and misty. The arcades and carousel are nice to see but aside from this there are street performs and it can appear a bit tacky. Worth a visit.",Dale7987
40,Great weather and great vibe,"First time in Los Angeles and of course visited the world famous Santa Monica Pier. Great weather, great vibe, the real Californian spirit here.",Coen van den Brink
40,Nice pier and extensive beach,"The pier denotes where PCH meets Route 66. A nice old pier, worth a visit. Parking nearby and beautiful looking beach to look at from the pier.",Mike C
40,Nice,The pier is relatively short and you can walk it in a few minutes even with a crowd.The shops are reasonably priced. The kids working the Funnel/Ice cream shop are very friendly and did a great job. The Pepsi machine broke and they had the quick thinking to have the shop across serve me the drink. I was impressed that they did that very quickly.The weather was great and there were several people out and about.,acostajesusb
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Love love love the pier! Every trip to Cali we wind up here one way or another LOL. Lots of souvenirs, great views, and even an amusement park makes for one terrific day (or night!) Parking can be tricky but we lucked out and got there early on a Sat morning so we could get a spot in the beach lot. Walked up some steps and BOOM right on the pier for the day. The kids tried their hand at games in the Pacific Park Amusement and everyone left with a prize. Spent the rest of the day watching live performers dance, do magic acts and drum along to music! Had dinner with the family of (9) at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and the kids got wet in the ocean. Packed a carry all bag for water bottles and swim stuff plus whatever else they wanted to buy. (Most places dont give u a big shopping bag so bring your own!) Prices for items were definitely reasonable.Stop at The Coffee Bean for a mid-day pick me up. The line may be a little long but worth the wait. We spent two days on the Pier and hit them up three times. Walk to the edge of the Pier for more breathtaking views, you won’t be disappointed!",judithh0718
50,Ferris Wheel,I went on the ferris wheel today at night time. It gave a good view of LA and what it offers. I really enjoy this place and I hope i can get back on it in the daytime once again.,Karen N
50,Fun Place!,This is one of the typical tourist spots but still worth the visit. The views are great and you can enjoy the restaurants.,Ken Q
50,The icon that defines Santa Monica,"If you mention Santa Monica, the first reaction is inevitably ""the pier"". It's probably more interesting on your first visit, and yes, it is getting more dirty every year, but there is still some interest here for everybody; - eating, drinking, rides, walking on the beach, views - so yes, you can't come to Santa Monica without visiting the pier.",RonWamberal
50,People watching paradise,"I didn't realize that this was the end of route 66! So cool. Several vendors and stores to check out. Singers , dancers and artists all over. Beautiful view of the water and the shore.",qv09vvp
50,Don’t forget to peer at the view,A great way to spend an afternoon! Must do the Ferris wheel for amazing photos. Great coffee at the coffee bean. Take a walk on the beach after.,Marc A
20,definitely going down,"Use to be a beautiful place my recent visit in june was really a big disappointmenthomeless all over, dirt and trash .",Enzo P
50,First time in California,Visiting from Virginia and had to visit the pier. It was quite an experience. We enjoyed it bit not sure it will be on our list for next time. I’d say do it if it’s your first time.,JLH68
30,Great to see!,"Great to see. I thought it was a little tired looking. There is a small fun fair, souvenir shop, cafes, traditional beach style toilets! People fishing, few homeless people, lovely views and nice clean, well kept beach. This was the beach where Baywatch was filmed!",Pamela M
30,Kinda bummed,We may have picked a bad hour or maybe just because it's summer but we couldn't enjoy anything here during our stay at we were looking forward to this the most. Too packed and lines were too long to get tickets to ride the rides or play games. My daughter was really disappointed. First time on the west coast and hopefully when we're back we can have a better experience. Also for anyone going for your first time be mindful there are alot of haglers trying to sell their products. We got approached by several.,Jackie S
40,Vacation,Great pier and people watching. A few too many homeless lurking but over all the pier is great and def a place to see.,jcdeligirl
50,Family Fun,"The kids enjoyed some rides, the weather was a little chilly when we went, which was fine. Crowded, but what do you expect of place such as this. My expectations were realistic & it didn’t disappoint. Buy wrist band for rides, it’s cheaper & look for the otters at the very end of the pier, begging for food. Adorable. Don’t forget to get you photo at the end of Route 66, if you traveled that route. We did!",Sarah F.
50,Landmark,This iconic pier is the end of Route 66 and a quaint and iconic landmark. It reminded us so much of piers in the Uk that we felt very much at home.The views of Santa Monica beach are breathtaking and you can access the boardwalk up to the ocean itself from the pier.,Victoria W
40,Excellent place to visit,We went there midweek to avoid the weekend rush and was not disappointed. The pier was clean and it all seemed well organised. Plenty of nostalgia walking along the pier harking back to 50’s. Well worth the couple of hours to stroll along and take in the sights including Santa Monica beach,pca1958
40,Second time,"It was my second time here. First tim, I was in awww! Second time, still am! Where I come from we don't pier. So seeing this for the first, I loved it. Second time, I booked a hotel in the area so I could come. I can walk up and down and still be amazed. First time I did the carnival ride and it was amazing",Ravilan G
50,So Much to See and Do,"Worlds collide on the Santa Monica Pier. You will see so many different people, all enjoying burgers and ice cream, waiting in line for rides, or buying beach toys and souvenirs. Worth the visit.",Nickie C
50,a must do.,great place to spend a few hours.gets packed but only adds to the atmosphere.a good fairground and lots of eats and drinks places.lots of performers on the pier and the best robotics dancer I have ever seen.go see!!,patphil71
30,Touristy,Visited here yesterday and it’s just your usual collection of trashy tourist shops and dodgy eateries . There were some quite good buskers who saved the day and provided some fun atmosphereDon’t go out of your way,Jennifer R
10,"Sorry to give this one star, but the few rides they have are so expensive......","The Santa Monica Pier Roller Coaster is really short and costs $10.00 to ride it once! The Wrist Band is on sale right now for $31.45, but there's only 12 rides in the whole place, some of those are for small children, and there's NO dark ride at all... Honestly, just go to Knott's Berry Farm if you want a HUGELY better Value... It's as low as $49 for an adult to get into Knott's!! That's $17.55 more for three amazing rides with Animatronics, a very nice Ghost Town with authentic buildings from an actual Ghost Town, several of the best roller coasters anywhere, and more!",Jeff N
50,"You've Seen It On TV 1,000 Times Now See it in Real Life","I live less than two miles from the pier and am admittedly biased, but it really is a wonderful place, a mix of old timey fun and new. I've been coming to the pier since 1984 and probably haven't gone a week without a visit since. It has changed a lot over the years, but it's always remained a run place to soak up the sun, watch the world go by, and see a sunset. Couple warnings - it can get very crowded. If crowds bother you, this is not a place to visit. The food on the pier is not as good as the food above the pier. If you're too tired to climb back up into Santa Monica, eat there, but if you have the energy, eat up on Ocean or Third.",Ricks for Free
20,Very small,The peer itself is very small. Parking is a nightmare. The vendors were not very nice or helpful. Not much to do. Nothing really stood out! We ate Dinner at Bubba Gump’s and it was good.,Gin B
40,A good place with great potential,"The Santa Monica Pier is iconic on a global scale. The best views in Santa Monica, a historic location as the end of Route 66 and lots of charm. Where it falls short is the lack of healthy options in one of America's healthiest cities, and the overall cheesy, cheap and sometimes unsafe feeling you get when visiting. I'd love to see some higher quality performers, at least one organic restaurant and more events that encourage healthy living.",ajaliwins
50,so much fun!!,"My daughter got to do the trapeze class, and I cannot recommend it highly enough!! We took a 9 day trip all over California, and the trapeze was the highlight of the entire trip!",Julie S
50,End of Route 66,"We finished our month-long US coast to coast trip here.. and the end of the Route 66 trail. Emotional! It is really fun-looking place with a arcade from the 30s, giant Ferris wheel and fantastic views of the bay and the mountains. Wooden pier is always full with people walking here, making memories and finishing at the end of the pier.",MildaLeo
40,It’s ok,"The pier has lots of food, kitchen, shopping and live entertainment options. The actual “theme park” is overpriced and very small. It’s a great place to spend a couple of hours, but not much more than that.",Emily L
40,Interesting and Famous Place to Visit!,"We found a parking spot near the pier, but the parking sign was like a clown had designed it. It had four different ""exceptions"". After spending 15 minutes trying to figure it out, we finally went in and asked at a restaurant if it was OK to park there. They said yes, I explained the signs, and they thought the last exception had to do with construction which was over for that day. We decided to take the chance and walked back to the Pier.It was pretty interesting with all the shops and restaurants and tourist traps along the pier. We spent about an hour there, took photos; We bought 10 postcards for $1.10us and a Route 66 T-shirt for $9us plus tax = $10usd. Route 66 ends at Santa Monica.This is also where the Pacific Highway, #1 begins, and that’s what we took when we left to go North. This helped to explain why we were continually directed (by GoogleMaps) to the interstate, on our way down the coast, to San Diego.",GaryReg
50,Fun and Sun,Great place to buy souvenirs. The rides were fun... beach was wonderful and the people were friendly.,Denise Amador
40,A Favorite,"This was one of the favorite places we visited on our week long vacation in LA. It was Sunday, and you would not know. We even got lucky and were able to see a sea lion off the edge of the pier who seemed to be performing for everyone watching him. The kids wanted to do the rides, but it was really pricey. We did a bike rental for 1 hour, and it was a very nice ride. The beach is not one of the cleanest we visited, but we loved the pier.",Ryan Becky J
50,It was cloudy but still fun,Had a blast visiting the Pier. Rode the roller coaster and big wheel. Great views and we saw dolphins frolicking at the end of Pier,Roach0629
50,Great fun,"Great fun, lots to do and plenty of food on and just off the Pier. Full of life everywhere along the pier. Definitely needs to be done and the box ticked if anywhere near Santa Monica.",David L
30,Now as a crotchety old man it has lost its appeal,"If you like crowds and noise in a beautiful setting the pier is for you. It has become so much busier over the past decade or so. Besides the souvenir shops and food stores, there are a number of carts selling junky trinkets or amplified music selling cds.We brought family members for their first visit and I just wanted to stand against the rail and watch the waves making their way to the beautiful beach . It was so busy and loud I couldn't hear the waves. This area is longer of interest for me, but I can imagine for most people there still is that appeal to get a selfie with a portion of the roller coaster in the background.No matter what, it still is a gorgeous beach !",Skwiki
50,crowded but fun,"We were there on Friday around lunch time in the beginning of May. It was crowded, but we had fun there watching different activities and listening to music. There were plenty of seats where we could sit and enjoy the view.",Irishka60645
50,Great time,Small park venue over the water with exciting rides. Did it as part of the GO LA pass. Parking was $14.,Ana M
40,Typical Touristy destination,"For families with kids is a great destination , for couples/ solo just an hour or so is sufficient.Walking distance from Downtown Metro Station, has few food outlets offering average food, Tshirt and sports gear, some street music and includes the Pacific amusement park.Has a nice restaurant at the end of pier but the weather was stormy the day I visited but Im sure that venue would be a great venue to spend a couple of hours.Parking is available onsite adjacent to Pier.",Sonali K
50,Great pier experience,"Great day on the pier met friends from orange county here and had lunch followed by all the pier had to offer rides, games,music, souvenirs outstanding views of santa monica had a great day.",jimmy150
40,Visited as in the area,Visited the famous pier at the end of route 66 as in the area for a guided tour.It's a famous pleasure pier and slot machine arcade. Good views up the coastline to Malibu and venice. Not much else apart from restaurant and bars. Ticked off to do list but probably not visit again,Ivess3
40,Very photogenic!,"Went to the pier in the early evening, and had a great time. Very crowded with not too much walkway space, but they are trying to squeeze a whole amusement park on a pier after all! We went right to the Ferris Wheel which was a great experience - gave you lots of time up top for photos and views. We then went into the arcade and had a blast from the past - I headed to Skee Ball, boyfriend went to the shoot 'em up video games, son hit the pinball machines - we all had a ball! As the sun went down we went out on the beach and got some amazing sunset photos which we loved. Would certainly come back again!",worleybird98
10,Rude staff!!!,"Don’t bother. It’s a waste of time and money, with only a few very average rides. Whatever you do, don’t take a photo as you get thrown off the ride by some rude teenage worker! Won’t be recommending to friends and family",Poodleparlour
50,Fun place,Fun place to visit. Have visited there several times. Reminds me of “the good ole days.” A place for all ages. The younger children enjoyed the interactive aquarium. Will definitely return.,Brlturner3
30,Bit of a disappointment,"Had friends visiting from New Zealand so we took them to the pier. Honestly, there just wasn't anything terribly interesting.The shops all have the same junk and the carts seem to be manned by derilicts.",Mirandalou
30,Past its use by date,Fun to visit and great viewsShops need sprucing up and some more fun things to buy! Worth the visit if in the area,Rita M
40,Fun place,Walked after dinner to the Santa Monica pier and it was a wonderful experience. It was after dinner and from the distance you could see the lights of the rides in the pier. Fun to watch at all the colorful designs produced by the lights on the ferries wheel in the distanceI think in Southern California it’s a fun thing to do,Ikemx
50,"People, food, music, dogs, what more could you ask for?","My wife and I really enjoyed our visit here. There was so much to see and hear. There was great music right up the end. Rides if thats your thing and plenty of food to choose from. PLus we met a very large mastiff dog there who was very friendly.Just watch out for the guys offering ""free"" music CDs",Peter S
50,Great people watching!,"Entertaining street performers, food/snacks, even into late nights! Great access to the beach from the pier.",Ruiz5anthem
40,We loved it but there isn't much to do before 11,"We go there early and the rides don't open until 11. But it was fun and I've driven by when on business years ago.Wanted to see it up close. The street music is excellent. Park on the pier. The lots are $15 but if you drive on the pier and park there ist's much cheaper. The gift shops were tacky, as we expected, but my husband got a shirt at Bubba Gump on clearence. We had fun",Loretta Veronic... L
50,Something for Just About Everyone,"Everything you need for a fun day at the beach is here; food, drinks, beautiful clean beach, carnival games and rides, vendors, and a great place to watch a sunset. Santa Monica Pier has them all. We had a very good time here playing on the beach and enjoying all that the pier has to offer. There are a few grifters and beggars, but you have to take the bad with the good.This was one of the better places we found to enjoy the beach.",Bill K
40,Good views,"We stopped by the pier on a weekday morning before heading out of LA. While it was windy and therefore a bit chilly there were still folks out sunbathing and enjoying the beach. It was a sunny day so the sand was warm but the water was still cold. The pier had lots of activities going on and what seemed like a lot of visitors for a weekday morning in May. There was at least one school group amongst the visitors. There were a variety of entertainment, shopping and eating options along the pier. We parked on the pier for $3 an hour which worked for us as we were not staying long. The best thing about this area is the views of the beach with the mountains in the background.",tarheeltraveler4509
20,Low End Crowded Carnival Walk,This will be a crowded place with various low end vendors and unremarkable food. Add this to all the homeless laying around in the park and it’s not a very good experience. One public restroom about 200 yards from the pier entrance. Expect a line. Worth about a 30 minute walk just to see the people. If you have a choice I’d pass on this. Looks like a better experience than it really is.,SigEpGov
50,"Great attraction, nice clean sand beach,",I love this place for a nice walk listening to the sea and also the great attractions and food. Me and my girl love the big wheel. I love the ice cream ;-),DerbyPhilip
30,Fantastic on a sunny day,"Nice place for fooling around, with good food, souvenirs and a fabulous view of the Santa Monica Beach.",Carlos C
40,Beachside fun,The beach is amazing and the view from the end of the pier is excellent. It is worth the whole walk. Lots of taxi bikes to go along the walkway. Very family orientated. Lots of people practicing the trapeze on the original muscle beach. Good rides for kids.,Vennessa G
30,People watching at its best!,"My husband and I were greatly amused as we walked along the pier and watched the performers, the artists, and musicians. My favorite was the group that held a dance off. Be sure to take your picture under the ""official End of Rt. 66"" sign as well!",Melaney68
50,That seaside feeling!,"Only had a quick stop here but it was just adorable. The pier is quite long but the walk up and down it is just lovely. The beach I really clean and nice and you can take some really amazing photos all the way along. I felt like I was back at a typical seaside resort when I was there, and felt like a little kid again. It was really nice and I’d recommend paying it a visit even if you only have a few hours or half a day.",MichelleByrne79
40,"Always nice, over the top but amusing","As end of the famous Route 66, always nice to visit the Pier again. One big tourist carnaval, but if you look at the end into the water, you might see some seals. It is fun to watch all the people from all over the world and get a reflection of yourself standing on the Pier. We always do it by bike, which gives an extra dimension. Really recommendable.",Arie E
40,Lovely pier with lots to do,"If you like the seaside then you'll love this pier. With attractions such as the fair rides, street performers, and snippets of history dotted around, it is definitely worth a visit.Plenty of restaurants and gift ships so satisfy everyone's needs and wants.",Fiona B
20,Tourist trap,Not much to see and not much to do... It's full of stands with nothing substantial to them. You can buy these same items cheaper along venice beach.,Remi T
30,Not exceptional,"Rather overrated, worth a short visit. Nothing memorable except that it is a historical (for West Coast standards) place.",Passenger1956
50,Fun,"Loved the pier, busy but lots of fun. We spent a lot but that’s kids for you lol. The views are fab too, it was a beautiful sunny day.",Angela Wells
50,Nice and iconic,"We wanted to go as we saw this place a few times in the Netflix Lucifer series. Parking was a bit expensive. We had a nice walk on the pier and the little history pictures at the end of the pier was interesting. We had a lot of fun with the little rollercoaster. We had the Go Los Angeles Pass, so this was included at no extra cost. Doing this at night was magical.",Kwi_kwa_ju
50,Fun Pier,"This pier is bustling with activity, there is lots to see and do as well as places to eat and drink. I would recommend visiting!",Dean
30,Santa Monica Pier,"This was my first time visiting Santa Monica Pier so I don't know what I expected but I was a little disappointed. The area, I found was run down and we had to walk by a group of people hanging around at the top of the hill leading down to the pier who had a donation box for pot sitting out for people to drop money in. We walked by several people who were high on one thing or another. They were not really bothering anyone but it was just different and not what I am used to.The pier itself was fun and I enjoyed the live entertainment and shops although the shops were expensive but that wasn't surprising. The ferris wheel was my favorite and it offered an incredible view. I didn't find it overly crowded but we were there fairly early. We walked around a bit to all the different shops in town but didn't find enough to keep us busy for an entire day.Overall, it was fun for the time we were there but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back. One time is enough for me and I would recommend visiting for anyone who is in the area. There aren't many places like that around.",C M
30,A little touristy,"Ok, but very small and a little touristy. Only about a dozen shops and restaurants combined. Nice place to people watch and kill time.",Julie P
30,Nice Place,"Santa Monica Pier is located at short distance walking from our Hotel, so we took the stroll... Don’t be shocked by the number of homeless “living” (or trying to survive) along the Promenade to the Pier... The Pier itself is ok, featuring some street artists, a lot of animations, restaurants, shops... it’s ok... We have seen it ONCE, are happy to have seen it - but THAT’S IT...",stoffel1953

40,Nice but too many people for me,Beautiful place with lots to do and see but just way too many people. Give yourself an extra hour or 2.,KyT27
30,Nice little pier,"Rather crowded with lots of people in the pier. It does provide some good views of the beach and it's fun watching the fisher people try their luck. Usual assortment of tacky shops and third rate restaurants .In the world their are some monster piers, amusement parks that are breathtakingly beautifulSMP is nice enough from a local perspective but I would not go out of my way to visit. But if your a local it's a pleasant place for a jog or stoll",Auscoach
30,Tourist Area,I just walked the pier and did not do any of the rides. It was crowded. The beach had swimmers and families enjoying the day. It was ok.,afiggy
40,Surprised,"I have always avoided the Pier but while on a beach run we decided to run to the end of the Pier. It reminded me of going down the shore as a kid, The shops are just as you would want and expect, selling beachy tourist stuff but it's always fun to look around. There are a few places to eat and hear live music, and there was even YOGA at the end of the Pier, a free, fun way to unwind.",Nancy M
10,If you like tacky things,"Good Lord this was like a county Fair. We drove into the parking lot and my 12 year old son said, oh please Dad can't we just leave? Nothing but chain food places and trinkets for tourists.",FamilyMan1963
50,Very interesting place to walk around,"Interesting shops, of course the long wooden boardwalk, the sign for the end of Route 66, the views of the ocean and the shoreline all make this a great experience. Park free at one of the Red Structures for 1.5 hours, some of which are on 2nd Street I believe. I parked in Red Structure 6. Then it is only like a 3 block walk to the bridge leading to the Santa Monica Pier",Thomas B

50,Lively and lovely,Santa Monica Pier is a must see when in LA. The area was lively on the day we visited and only a short Uber from Hollywood. Experience the sights and sounds of the long beach and take a walk down to Venice Beach which is eclectic.Also check out the Zoltar machine if you remember the Tom Hanks film ‘Big’.,evo_321
40,"It's a must visit, but nothing great","It is something you have to see, but don't expect more than an experience. There are rides and a trapeze place. There are a few restaurants as well.",TravelingBbusFun

40,Fun for everyone. Great for a stroll and look around or for the rides if you are into that,"Great for a stroll and look around or for the rides if you are into that. Good for families or couples, Lots of options for food of all types. Many games and rides to go on or play. Some interesting facts listed. Quite a few shops for souvenirs. Lovely at night with the lighting and rides lit up. Very good spot to visit.",KarinnaCraig
20,Tears for Piers,"Apart from being at the end of Route 66, I’m not sure why you’d want to visit. The view is good if fleeting. Everything else is more or less what you’d expect. Kids would enjoy it more than adults I suspect.",noel i

40,Wonderful around sunset,First time to see the pier and it was just beautiful in the early evening. The ocean breeze and people watching was worth the visit. The views of the pacific and coastline were stunning.,Greg Pauig
30,Kitchy LA Fun,"Pack your wallet and your sunscreen. The pier is one of the kitchiest spots in LA, but worth the visit, especially for tourists seeking the quintessential LA tourist trap. The rides are fun (buy online for a discount and just get the pass), show up at early to avoid the crazy afternoon crowds, skip the overpriced fried food options and head up into Santa Monica for hundreds of good eats at any price.",BeauSidwell
40,Fun stop,"This was a great site to see. Beautiful views of the ocean, fun sites, many different places to eat. Loved how it was easy to get to the board walk and walk all the way to Venice Beach.",Pam B
50,Lots of fun!,It was my first time in LA. Me and a co-worker took Uber to Santa Monica Pier. What can I say...Lots of things to do!Beautiful ocean views...beach...rides...lots and lots of food options. Lots of bars around to grab a drink. You can spend the whole day here because there is so much you can do.Highly recommended!,yaasir
50,Fun in the sunset,Had a great hour or so on the rides and taking in the sunset and atmosphere. Plenty of shops and eateries and some good buskers too.,ClanClark
40,End of the Mother Road,"We celebrated our accomplishment on the Pier. It was neat to park on the pier and walk around. The view is terrific. There are rides, restaurants, food carts and souvenir shops.",kdpbball
30,"Nothing Exciting, but Great Views","It’s nothing spectacular, but it’s a great view of the Pacific Ocean. It’s also one of those things you just have to do if you’re in the area. There are a few rides and a little food, the best being the cart where a gentleman cuts up fruits with lime an chilé! I guess I had really high expectations and I just didn’t find it very exciting.",Deanna B
40,Really Nice to See!,"We loved wandering along Santa Monica Pier! We went as far out as it would go and a seal (or a sealion) was swimming about right in front of us! The locals had recommended we visit and I would also recommend it, as it was great to see!",Emily
40,Historical Fun,Everyone knows of the infamous Santa Monica Pier. I really enjoyed walking around and observing the people. So much to see.,Juliathemother
50,Great place to walk around with a view of the Pacific Ocean,"I visited the Santa Monica Pier in April 2019. The first challenge is to find parking. I decided to park in a parking lot which costs $14 for the day. It was easier to find parking there as I had to drive around first and did not find anything. From this parking lot, you can walk on a walking path near the beach for about 5-10 minutes straight to the Santa Monica Pier. The view of the Ferris Wheel, the rides and the pier is awesome. Once on the pier, there is a lot of activity, restaurants, shops and it is very crowded with people. The view of the beach and the Pacific Ocean is really nice. There is a sign of Route 66 because Route 66 ends at Santa Monica Pier (and begins in Chicago). All of these are photo opportunities. I really enjoyed my visit to Santa Monica Pier.",blairkk25

30,First Time Visit- It was an Okay Place,"My first time visiting the pier and it was very crowded. Parking was not convenient, but that was expected for such a popular place. My children enjoyed the rides and the food we ate was okay. The scenery was nice and we were able to get some good pictures. Overall, I’m glad I went, but it’s not something I need to see again.",Raymond B
50,Lovely stroll along the pier and beach.,Super beach and pier with extensive restaurants and amusements from a big wheel to fortune tellers. You could actually spend the day people watching.,Escape24379429871
50,Loved it!,I’m so glad we stopped here! Awesome place to visit. Even though it was very crowded on Mothers Day we enjoyed walking around. The beach was beautiful and clean. The pier has multiple places to eat and even a few rides for kids.,Ellen055
50,A Must Do,"Every time I’m in LA, I make a trip to the pier. We love the view of the beach and the mountains. It’s a carefree walk from one end to the other where you can stop in an old arcade, buy souvenirs, see live entertainment, let your children ride the amusement park rides, have an adult beverage, have dinner at one of the restaurants or just grab a funnel cake. I never get tired of it.",Michele From Pittsburgh
50,Fun.,"I enjoyed walking the pier. There is plenty to see, and there is a lot of people watching. It's quite crowded, so it must be fun for all.",TarJa
50,A Must for Tourists,"Even if you're not big on crowds, you have to at least drop by the pier if you're from out of town. If you go early in the day it's pretty quiet and peaceful. There's fun rides, access to the beach, and affordable souvenirs! Go up a block and find a better price on sweatshirts though.",Molly S
30,They Call This An Amusement Park?,"I was an Everclear fan...I watched the scene where Forrest Gump ran to the pier and then turned around and went back. I had romanticized Santa Monica. But Y'all gotta come to the Jersey Shore to see what a ""real"" pier and amusement park is. This is more of a Coney Island weirdo feel than a family friendly fun time. Don't get me wrong: it was very pretty and the cliffs to the north were very picturesque. But trust me - a Jersey girl knows her stuff. This place was really disappointing and massively overrated.",T Coop

40,Peoplewatching paradise,"As visitors in LA we had trouble finding the right entrance to the parking lot. Finally we made it and paid the 14 dollar fee for dayparking.The beach is huge, clean, beautiful and filled with interesting people. The view of the beach from the pier is wonderful.The pier itself is lined with souvenir shops, restaurants and also a few talented street musicians.There’s also an amusement park on the pier which looked kinda sad. It felt as if this is where all old rides go to retire.Some goes for the arcade hall. It was jam-packed with arcade games most of which were past their glory days. Kids seemed to enjoy it though.There are restrooms on the pier but I don’t recommend using the one down by the parking lot. It was filthy.All the above things - both good and bad - make up the overall charming atmosphere of the pier.",Helena Ö
40,Very attractive at night,"We’re “oldies” who rarely take more than a couple of rides when we visit amusement parks these days. However, with its free entry and wide range of food options, the Santa Monica Pier is still a favorite. After dark, the pier lights up with a very pretty display. Worth a detour!",Greg H
40,A hangout place,"Lively place with activities. Electric atmosphere. Street activities, food counters etc. Lots of parking facilities around. Do visit in santa Monica.",dr.pragnesh Vachharajani
40,Great views!,The pier is very busy as expected. Lots of restaurants in the area with seating that allows you to take in the views.,JKgirl
40,Fun and beautiful thing to do.,"We were surprised how nice the area was and how beautiful the views were. We parked on top of the cliffs and paid for meter parking at $2 per hour. The parking on the beach next to the pier is $14 per car. Plus being on top of the cliffs made it a nice walk and fantastic views. The area is very nice (versus the dumpy Venice Beach). They make the walk down to the pier pretty easy. Long grade down so it's not too steep. There is an amusement park and some food. We didn't use any of that, just visited. So, it is well worth doing when all it cost was $2 for the entire family.",ScottD42868

50,Love Mondays,"Usually monday is the perfect day to visit the pier, not that many people is around as the majority go to the pier on sunday. I like taking my fishing pole and spend my afternoon here.",Jhon R
50,Good views,It’s easy to just walk out here and enjoy the views of the water and the city. Not sure if I’d bother with any food and attractions (which often have strangely short hours) but it’s easy to ignore them.,mrdom
40,Iconic Pier,This is the famous and iconic Santa Monica pier and a must see in LA. The views are cool and so are the people. Food is in a food court atmosphere and can be too expensive. Would suggest eating at nearby restaurant not on the pier.,LiketoeatCincinnati
30,"Nice beach, ok pier.","Busy pier with some rides and places to get food and drinks. There were a couple that my 8 yr old would go on, my teen wasn’t interest and found it to be too crowded. Quite a few people trying to sell you things. It was an interesting stop, and the beach looked nice, but I would not go out of my way to go here more than once. Looked to be some kind of market that was being taken down when we arrived—wish i hadn’t missed it. Maybe some kind of weekly market?",Traveling91012
50,Fun at the Pier,"We really enjoyed Santa Monica Pier. It has a great family feel, yet there were many couples enjoying the ocean from the benches. We didn’t ride any rides, but they sure looked fun! There are a lot of things to enjoy, plenty of food and drinks. A “must see” in Santa Monica. We were there during the day, and after dark. Beautiful lights at night! The Ferris Wheel has exceptional lighting!",Tina116C

30,Family weekend trip,"In LA visiting family and to site see. Came here on a Sunday afternoon, just happened to be Cinco de Mayo. Very festive atmosphere, seemed very busy, great to see coast and caught a glimpse of a sea lion. Didn't go on rides. Pier Park smelled of popcorn and urine...City needs to address the urine smell, maybe hose down in morning after they kick out homeless/bums.",Michelle S
40,Finally here,"Been to LA several times but never had time to get to the pier. Drove by it but never could stop. Great fun spot with lots of lights and people watching. Walked around the pier to get the full flavor of the atmosphere. Fun place with cool vibe.My husband was an extra on Seinfield back in the day and we recreated his scene on the boardwalk, so fun!!And the icing on the cake was a pic in the photobooth, lots of laughs 😎",boktasofplainville
30,A Little Pricey But GREAT EXPERIENCE & Something FUN TO DO!,"Expect to spend a decent amount! $50 for a unlimited ride bracelet for adults and about $17 for a toddler. In my opinion, there were not that many rides for a $50 bracelet and most of the games were $5. I rode some of the kiddie rides with my toddler to try and get my moneys worth. It is a unique experience just expect to spend a bit. Boardwalk had exciting things going on from people and vendors - bring your camera because it is vibrantly colored and visually stunning.",JenniferLeeSKG
50,Beautiful area,Santa Monica pier was a great place to visit with the end of Route 66 sign on the pier. Overlooking the famous beach where bay watch was filmed . The famous film Forrest Gump was filmed on the pier with bubba gump shrimp factory with a souvenir shop to get all your souvenirs from the film . A beautiful area and very lively with different places to eat . A must see if in Santa Monica area .,TopFlightHotels
40,Very busy & well policed,"A fun place to visit with numerous restaurants & a small amount of rides (Pacific Park).

I am a local and ride the Merry-Go-Round a few times a year....and have done so for decades. I was embarrassed and insulted. But they did refund my admission fare.",JimJxxx

40,Family fun,We took our grandkids for a day at the pier and beach. It was fun with something for everyone. We arrived early to be able to park on the pier. It’s fun to people watch while the kids ride the rides. Several good places to eat on the pier. You can also hit the beach or rent bikes to ride.,Dale R
40,Bike riding and roller blading,Santa Monica pier is always a starting point to bike ride or rollerblade on the beach. This is my favorite area of Los Angeles. I like to take bike rides from this area to Venice Beach and back. Our street promenade is not too far where you can grab a bite to eat. And the beach is right at your fingertips. Love it.,Johnnyboydc
30,"Over rated, cold and very busy","I was really looking forward to seeing Santa Monica Pier, but I came away from our visit a little underwhelmed.Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but I certainly wouldn't rush back there again.Maybe the weather ruined it for us, as it was a bitterly cold day (at the end of April still?) with high winds, so that wasn't very pleasant at all.If you have little kids this would be a good place for you, as the rides are really suitable for young children, but as an older couple it wasn't really targeted to us.Nonetheless, it was nice to look around the pier and see the beach. The retail vendors were very good.",Kathy M
50,Fun experience,Must visit if you're in the area. Fun for the whole family. Great entertainment. Beautiful scenery. Many places to eat. Several shopping venues.,ernie m

50,Love this view!,"We stayed in Santa Monica and checked out the Pier and Venice Beach, which is walking distance. Loved all the vintage and surf shops and walking on the beach. Lots of surfing and just really neat to be there when it is the background of so many famous movies. Just beautiful!",ati1984
40,The End of Route 66 is A Tourist Heaven,I don't know too many locals that go to the Santa Monica Pier but I can see it from my new condo which is kinda nice. My 7 year old loves the rides but what seven year old doesn't. It gets VERY crowded in the summer as it is loaded with tourists. The fact that the local train ends right there too now doesn't help with the crowds. Food options aren't that good on the pier but you don't have to walk to far to find great stuff in Santa Monica. Ivy by the Shore being one of the best around.,FlyersFanInLA

30,"Nice, But Pricey","Great old pier, places to eat and the usual pier attractions (arcade, places to eat etc)You can rent fishing equipment if you fancy doing a bit of fishing.

50,Great place to play and eat,"Great place to play and eat, we walked along to Venice Beach (muscle beach) too and had a fantastic time",Ray
50,Finally visited Dell Perro Pier of GTA V !!,My first reaction was 'wow they made it so real in GTA'.The pier itself is ok. It could get smelly as some people love fishing there.The rollercoaster ride lasted may be less than a minute! Hot Dogs were super expensive here.Took some photos from various angles and then went to the shores to watch the sunset.Overall it was a nice visit.,Akhil P Walia
30,Ok Pier,"We visited whilst on vacation in June. Plenty of parking on the pier to the sides of the pier near the beach. It was a busy Friday afternoon some good amusements on the pier and shops and restaurants. Route 66 sign great for photos the rides on the pier massively over priced at 10 dollars each for the rollercoaster and Feris Wheel we went on rollercoaster at a cost of 3p dollars fab views but expensive.Views up the coast fantastic from pier but be aware , at top of pier lots of people hanging about trying to get money . They saw we were British Tourists and followed us down the pier had I not stopped and noticed them I think they would have mugged us lucky it was busy and I spotted them .",Dean S
40,Crazy Busy!,Every time we visit Santa Monica we love walking the Pier. It’s become so crowded you end up doing a shuffle instead. Ate lunch at The Albright and had yummy lobster rolls. Lots of souvenir stands on the Pier if that’s your thing. Ferris Wheel is always amazing too. Sunsets from here are usually fabulous!,JCzapski
40,LA,"A hazy day and for an early Friday morning there were still a few hundred people on the pier. The solar powered Ferris Wheel is a landmark. The pier has appeared in many movies and shows. The guide said they can get up to 30,000 on the pier but I think that’s a stretch",JohnandMichelle87
40,Something for everyone,"There is a little something for everyone at the Santa Monica Pier. From unique restaurants to a ferris wheel to a beautiful beach, there's almost certainly something for you to enjoy.I recommend Bubba Gump Shrimp. However, there is generally a wait so it's best to sign up for a reservation right when you get there, and then spend a little time on the pier while you wait for your table.There is also parking located right next to the boardwalk, but it is $30 for an all day pass. It's a little pricey, but it will save you some walking.",FootTrafficTravelers
40,Nice place,We have been there for just couple of hours. The pier is pretty large and has enough charm to visit. On the other side it is too noisy and very busy. Many people try to sell him/herself there which can be a bit disturbing...,Gyorgy_KGYK

50,Santa Monica visit,"Busy area lots of people about,plenty of fast food outlets the iconic ferris wheel,could have spent all day there but we were on a tour and only got to stay 90 minutes, really enjoyed visit would highly recommend",Michael D
40,"Lots to do, but can be pricey.","Came on a sunny day with strong 40+ mph winds. Still very busy. Parking was ample though just a few blocks away from the Pier. We spent a couple of hours here as we had some time to kill before flying out of LAX. We mostly window shopped but did choose to ride the main roller coaster. It was short, not that exciting and $10 each! Not worth it. They had carnival games as well, but too expensive for the dinky toys you could win. Still an iconic place with great views and plenty to do if you want to spend some money.",Michael M
30,Fun to see the ocean,"Some attractions include Ferris wheel, and other carnival like entertainment located in a great place close to many lovely hotels and attractions . On the Santa Monica beach with lots of life guards and pretty safe .",Vegan Traveler
40,We love some pier,"It's a must do when you're from out of town and it never fails to provide exactly what is expected. Only thing Im not keen on is that the some of the street entertainers are on the sketchy side. You'd think they'd be better at policing these after all this time. It's a great place to hang out for a hour or two though, just don't expect any gourmet food close by.",John P

50,Surprisingly Fun!!!,"My family of 4 came by here after taking the Hop On Hop Off bus tour planning on only spending a couple of hours but ended up spending most of the day. There was so many fun things to do with kids that we decided to spend more time here than originally planned. Between riding the Ferris Wheel, renting bikes to go down to Venice Beach and playing on the beach there are many things to do. And to top it off there are amazing views of the beach with mountain ranges that make for awesome photo ops.",jesse.lodge
10,Gone downhill,We took a taxi to Santa Monica pier and walked down to Venice late on a Wednesday afternoon. It is not how I remembered it many years ago -as we walked the pathway down it felt quite unsafe and very dirty . I am unsure whether the legalisation of marijuana for adults in 2016 is a contributing factor but we did honestly feel on edge at times not a place to bring young children and couldn’t wait to get back in a taxi - what a shame and the hotels in this area I imagine are suffering as a result,NickandRaff
40,Fun and delightful view,Enjoyed the pier although pretty crowded. Beware of aggressive solicitors though-My biggest complaint.,LLMHerb
50,Just like the old days.,This place brings me back to my days on the boardwalk back home . All the attractions overlooking the seaside . We walked from the pier to the fishing peir in Venice beach. The fun and excitement of the rides are memorable to my youth .,ClassicCouple
40,Great summer getaway,"If you want to escape the summer heat in the L.A. area and don't mind fighting traffic driving to the beach, the Santa Monica Pier is a great choice for couples on a date, families with kids, and young adults who want a place to hang out. Rides on the pier are of the typical amusement park variety (carnival rides), but the roller coaster is awesome for such a small park. If you go on only one ride because you don't want to ""break the bank"" on a park ride wristband, go on the roller coaster. Pier food and rides are expensive, so plan on spending a lot of money if you have a family or plan on going on rides and eating a lot of food. Parking is iffy and not cheap, especially on the weekends. It's better to park in a Santa Monica city lot and walk a few blocks.",Jerry Crawford
50,great way to end the day,"been here plenty of times and always take first timers here. Also a good spot to come late afternoon before head back home on flights as short drive to airport. Great people watching spot and end of route 66, apart from the rides and places to eat always buskers and entertainment going on but very busy make sure you head off the pier and go for a walk along the beach foot path. Another great place to people watch or see beach volleyball, acrobats",Greig C

20,"I’ve seen it, I don’t need to again",This was my first trip to Santa Monica. We walked over to the pier in the early morning and walked along past the performers and gift shops to the end for a view of the ocean. And then we left and didn’t need to go back. It’s nice to see for the bucket list but I don’t feel like I need to go again.,Rhyannon B
20,Overrated,"This place is definitely overrated. Regular amusement park, with shops. Dirty looking, overcrowded, nothing special.",Elenka S.
50,Allow several hours...,"A happy, fun and exciting place with SO much to see. We completely underestimated how long we needed to really experience it all. My advice is to allow several hours. The views and atmosphere are like nothing else we have seen. We plan to return and stay in Santa Monica. This is a must do experience.",FamilynFun
50,Fantastic place,"We spend 5 hours there, did some rides, wander the shops, had dinner at Bubba Gump, but the best part were the views. We saw the sunset and it was beautiful!",jcisinthehouse
50,Packed out cool place,"Loads of people happily enjoying the pier and weather. Food food, cheap cycle hire and the occasional seal.",Silverback19
50,A Classic,End of Route 66.Fun place with loads to do. Free to go on but paid heavily to park in adjacent car park. But I did have an RV so had to pay for 4 spaces $56.Some great street performers and some awful ones.,Al B
30,Nice Place,"Santa Monica is a very Nice place for shopping, bath , Sunny or ti est something @ Pier. It’s the real California.",Nicole B
50,A must visit!,"Santa Monica and the Pier is a must see on your trip to LA. It is very clean and has lots to do and see.The pier is pretty big and boats lots of great views and photo opportunities. There is a small theme park with around 10 rides and a selection of games. We had unlimited ride access due to our ‘LA Go Passes’ which was great! Fun for all adults & children! Especially loved the Ferris wheel as we got loads of great photos and was able to overlook Santa Monica beach!The pier has lots of eateries, food & drink outlets, souvenir stands, street performers and shops. There are accessible toilets and changing facilities available.A lovely walk around, with people fishing at the bottom of the pier. Would highly recommend!",LJBanny
50,Iconic,"Iconic! It was clean, the locals are very friendly and very helpful. The rides were definitely pricey, but it was all apart of the experience. However, you won’t spend all day here. I would suggest renting bikes to go down to Venice and come back at night for the rides!",Ashley
40,LA beach trip,"Very cute old pier with theme park rides, little shops and places to ear. Nice for a day out and suitable for families. Lots of restrooms and nearby parking.",55connie
40,Why Do You Go? Because It's There!,"As we walked down Santa Monica Pier I kept having this weird vibe that I had been there before. Then I realized it's because in our travels, especially to ocean and beach towns throughout the country and world, we've experienced many of the same things Santa Monica Pier offers. While the amusement park is somewhat unique the main draw is that many of us recognize it from TV shows and movies. There are numerous eating establishments and of course the ever present street (pier) performers trying to make a buck. Perhaps the most iconic feature of Santa Monica Pier is the sign marking the end the famous Route 66. It's almost requisite to have your picture taken there especially if you've been to the beginning of Route 66 in Chicago. The pier is nice for people watching and strolling and of course there are So. Cal souvenirs sold along the way. Parking on the pier is available as well as a number of lots along the expansive beach, but we were there in April so I imagine it can get very crowded in the summer months. If so inclined, bike & scooter rentals are also available before you actually get up onto the pier.",Jeff C
50,Very cool and iconic,"Visited last year as the pier is famous for many things but it’s iconic to kids from the grand theft auto game.It’s so much more than that, lots of cool shops, bars and restaurants",James H
50,Picturesque,"I liked Santa Monica, lots of restaurants, picturesque views, Muscle beach is fun for the teens so they can do all the ropes, etc. The pier with all the carnival games is cute, daughter enjoyed some rides. Good pictures and nice sunsets.",Dreamer827012
20,Overpriced and dated,There is a balance on charging an expensive price and ripping people off.The price for games and rides are extortionate. Like a british fun fair in terms of the rip off games....The only value is the carousel which is only 2 bucks a ride and kids loved.Someone needs to control the prices on this pier...,mmc
40,Great,Went for an hour or so. Was like a smaller Coney Island. A lot of fun and great to go in the Pacific.,Mike

50,Lots to do,"Very busy area, parking was $14. Nice walk and plenty to do. Nice views and entertainment. Singers, dancers, shopping and eating.",unyquetravels
30,A place you should visit,We went there for a visit at lunch. There were many people and it was quite chaotic but nice to see. There was all kind of artist so it was a great walk.,lbernad
20,Busy & touristy,Over crowded people walking in every direction...hard to get through. Nice scenery but not worth the hype. Lots of people selling churros up and down the pier. Kind of annoying are also the people teying to hand you bracelets. Not good for strollers or small kids I would be careful to watch purses as well. I was happy I went ro say I did but would not go back.,gypsygirl31
50,Scenic and Iconic,The first sight of the sign for the pier will have you reaching for your camera. Really cool to see in person. If you go on the weekend don’t be in a hurry because it gets crowded. Worth the walk which is lined with lots of street performers that are fun to watch. After you hit the pier and check out the Promenade shops where you will see lots more street performers. Both great places to people watch and shop.,Les L
40,Very Iconic,After playing GTA5 it was brilliant walking around and under the Santa Monica Pier. The pier itself is fun but extremely bus yet a must do if in town.,travelingman9118
10,faded glory,faded glory. A too messy and cattle place. People are just walking here and drinking a d eating fast food. No this is not a nice place and much to crowded. It has lost all his original glamour.,Jankees Rovers
50,Historic pier,"Fantastic feature of Santa Monica is the pier. The pier has all the usual suspects. Hawkers selling t shirts, sunglasses and hats then there are artists drawing, painting and even a few guys making clay models of your face . All very entertaining. The end of the pier has great views across the bay and back to shore . The funfair was very busy everyone looked like they were having fun",Jock McKenzie
30,Fun but crowded,"We have 12 and 14 year old daughters. They enjoyed the pier, rode the Ferris wheel which is $10 a ride. Worth seeing but do not need to spend much time.",Sonya S
50,Santa Monica Pier & End of Route 66,"The famous and infamous Santa Monica Pier is an L.A. landmark. Since opening in 1906, travelers from all over come to see the trademark ferris wheel that sits over the pier. But the Santa Monica Pier is also recognizable from its numerous movie appearances.This instantly-nostalgic structure served as a backdrop for a number of Hollywood movies over the years such as Forrest Gump and Iron Man.With a carousel, an arcade, an amusement park, restaurants,the Santa Monica Pier offers a wide range of activities for the whole family.A sign at the end of the Santa Monica Pier marks the end of the legendary American highway Route 66, symbolizing that this road only ended when the sea stood in its way.*Tip; This provides a great photo opportunity for the traveler.",Gary M
50,Great amount of stuff to do.,"Great for ocean, pier, people watching, events, shops, musicians, many restaurants have on pier and off pier. Outstanding!",Sisyphus Rocks
20,Going down hill,"We were here a couple of years ago and enjoyed seeing the street performers on the pier so we were looking forward to going back when we were back in town this month. We took a hop on hop off bus tour and so we got dropped off across rhe street and walked through the little park in front of the boardwalk. It was about noon time and very busy. Still, the park was scary. There were a lot of homeless people camped out. When we left there were guys fighting and screaming at each other yelling some pretty vulgar things. The boardwalk was packed and that is fine, but there were two performers who I would consider inappropriate for kids. There were some others too who were fine and pretty good. We did have lunch at the restaurant at the end of the pier and it was expensive but good. The views are still wonderful and the beach looks nice. I would not consider this a family friendly atmosphere.",Jill K
50,Iconic site to visit,"Has to be a must do on any list when visiting Los Angeles. We parked underneath and parking fees were reasonable for that area. Great to walk around, lots of activity and people on the boardwalk and pier! Definitely recommend a ride on the rollercoaster also.",ciara736
50,"So chiche, I know . But cannot beat that sunset!","Another notch off the tourist checklist:) I guess it may get old for locals, but such an iconic pier. Obviously visited in time to catch the setting sun and the lighting was beautiful. Something so nostalgic about this place...it just harkens back to another time, a taste of summer for a northern visitor. I didn't realize it was the end of the famous Route 66. Lots of opportunity for some really pretty photos and some great memories. This from a magical mother/sons vacation.",kweenbee7
40,Fun experience,Very pleasant experience at the pier. Right off the beach with several ways to access the pier. A little too many independent vendors who were in your personal space but still a good time.,Natalie F
40,Fun Time,"Went down to the pier for one night and had fun with the kids. Bucket list type thing to do. Pretty expensive paying $10 to ride the Ferris wheel or roller coaster, but I guess you have to do it.",Collins W
50,Fun for all!,"Fun in the sun, toes in the sand, seagulls gawking above you and the spinning ferris wheel. Plenty of paid parking at the beach or nearby. Beautiful beaches all around, yummy food to eat and plenty to see and do!",Jess
40,Great beachside fun,"We stumbled upon this spot unintentionally and had a great evening. They have fair and arcade games, fair food, rides, and entertainment. Food was outrageously expensive and it took me 30 minutes to get a funnel cake- LOL, service sucked. Regardless, it was great beachside entertained and would recommend checking it out!Added plus: incredible sunsets!",Holly
30,Crowded and a lot of homeless people,Visiting San Monica pier as part of a bus tour of LA and only had an hour to enjoy. It was pretty. The homelessness took away from the fun. Any shaded area was claimed by the homeless and their stuff. Limited time so didn’t have time for more than a short walk and lunch. Lots of food trucks but no place to eat. Lots of dogs too. Glad I got to see it once. Great placesto eat.,rosebud001
50,Pier,Fun and relaxing . Friendly people. Good restaurants around . The views are really good. The arcades are good for all ages. Few rides to kill time . Watching the sunset is amazing,Amer M
50,Fun day at Santa Monica Pier,We found a parking garage within close walking distance to the pier. We grabbed lunch at Big Deans which was an inexpensive and delicious choice. We all enjoyed the carnival games and the Ferris wheel. Great views and photo opp. We saw dolphins swimming. The beach is gorgeous and the sand is so soft.,FunFoodFamilyFab5
50,A must,This was our 2nd visit here and it's our favorite thing to do in Santa Monica. The beach wasn't too packed the vibe is relaxing. There was something always going on every time we were there as far as entertainment different singers and dancing. Of course there's the rides and restaurants as well. We will continue to come back!,vindes

20,Sisters Birthday Getaway,Not sure what all the hype is about!Wanted to visit a beach before leaving LA and this area was recommended by several people! I found it to be dirty and over priced! Eight dollars a ride is a little expensive! And homeless people sleeping on the beach and under the pier. On a positive note had a wonderful lunch at Albright’s.,Charnj
40,"Beautiful views and busy, lively vibe on the Pier","We picked a beautiful day, with blue skies to visit the Santa Monica Pier with our 2 daughters aged 11 and 13. It was very busy with tourists and street performers. It was a really lively vibe and good fun for an hour or so. There is a fairground on the pier and so we also enjoyed some rollercoaster and rides, plus traditional fairground games and stalls. Lovely views out across the beaches on both sides of the pier. Lovely photos opportunities.",tjflutterby
50,Relaxing,A nice relaxing walk and a little entertainment at Pacific Park! Totally a must see for any sight seers!,travelergirl96
40,Family visit,"I have been here before pre-kids but as we had a day to burn after our cruise, we decided to spend the day at Santa Monica. It was really busy but the kids had a lot of fun. The amusment park is on the small side (but as expected as it's on a pier) and a touch expensive ($5 per ride unless you buy the unlimited wrist band). Lots to look at and just a fun atmosphere. We also stopped at Scoops for some ice cream - also expensive. It is a tourist trap but iconic and fun at the same time. A day or day and half is probably enough time to experience it.",Family8travels
50,"Great visit, great location, just a tad expensive for what you get","Over priced for what you get, but a must to visit. Really warm and nice location, just chill out and enjoy what you see",buckyCumbria
50,Great Place to Bring Visiting Out-of-State Friends & Family,"The Santa Monica Pier is a Great Place to Bring Visiting Out-of-State Friends & Family!! Most visitors have watched varies television shows and movies with scenes of the Santa Monica Pier. So, it’s on a lot of Tourists’ Bucket Lists!!",Karmyn J
50,So much fun!,It was a lively and lovely spring night at the pier. So much family fun and lots of entertainment. We felt like this was a great family atmosphere with lots of rides and fair type food choices. We took an Uber from our hotel because we were about 8-9 blocks away.,ilovehellokitty3
30,"Crowded, but always space for a few more","We visited here on a Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to get parked really close to the pier for very reasonable charges. The first 90 minutes were free! The best thing for us was the sign marking the end of Route 66. Very entertaining and talented performers line the pier. Tourist shops overpriced. We’ve been once and are pleased we did it, but won’t be going back any time soon.",Gill168
50,The Best Pier!,"We’ve visited many coastal towns large and small and The Santa Monica Pier is by far the best Pier...great Mexican lunch at the end of the Pier, along with other food options, games, shopping, street entertainment, fishing and people watching.

30,"Lots of HonkyTonk, Crowds, Weird People, but A Great Ferris Wheel","You're going to encounter panhandlers, loud people, crowds, and high prices. If you must go, then get on the ferris wheel for the incredible view which stretches north to Malibu and South to Rancho Paloss Verdes.",Mary R
50,Rode the Roller Coaster,Stopped for lunch and checked out the pier and decided to be adventurous and ride the roller coaster! so fun and many venders to grab gifts from; also the best churro ever!!!,sacsoup
40,The pier,The pier itself is pritty good. There is a little area to find out the history of the pier which was interesting. The rides pritty good for a pier theme park but there aren't many. Worth a visit if you have some time or are in the area.,Gavin W
50,"Super touristy, but you have to do it","I love this Pier, but I hate how crowded it gets during the summer - it’s like trying to walk through molasses. That being said, if you’re a tourist in Santa Monica, I recommend you walk by and get your picture in front of the Route 66 sign and ride the Ferris Wheel and embrace the fact that you’re on vacation and you’re at the Santa Monica Pier!!If you have a Groupon account, a lot of times you can get the wristbands for unlimited rides for 50% off. Otherwise the rides are pricey and you’ll still have leftover tickets since the whole system is set up to make you want to buy more tickets in order to use up the ones you already have.There are various games you can play and food for purchase; if you’ve never had one, try a strawberry funnel cake. It’s the quintessential American dessert for when you’re walking around on a sunny day contemplating if you want to ride rides or just people watch.There are bathrooms towards the end of the pier that are surprisingly clean, and there are a number of stalls. If you walk all the way to the end, you can watch some fisherman try to reel in fish. It smells a bit, but it’s the ocean, so what would you expect? There are benches for you to sit although those are usually taken. I would recommend coming here at dusk if you can - the rides light up and you can watch a gorgeous Santa Monica sunset while overlooking the ocean. It does get chilly at night though so bring a light sweater.Tdlr; a major Santa Monica institution; good to visit during day or night, and good for families, friends, and couples.",Shanelle
30,Nothing to Have to see,"The trip to the Pier was a hassle because of traffic. Do not go on a weekend. We had to turn around and go on a weekday. The Pier itself has few attractions, some rides for the kids and one arcade. There are some outdoor Kiosks and plenty of peddlers trying to sell you some cheap items. In an hour your through it all or maybe less time. The ocean is always beautiful though. Parking in a garage right off the Pier was successful and the cost was reasonable.I guess you have to see it if visiting the area but you may be surprised by the lack luster appeal.",Karen R
40,Fun Pace to Visit,"It was crowded but had plenty of parking and lots of restaurants, shops, and boardwalk vendors (lots of churros). Watched the sunset from here, which was a great experience. Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant is right on the pier and has fun souvenirs from the Forrest Gump movie. Short walk to Del Frisco restaurant for a great steak afterward. Very windy and much cooler than it is further off the water, so dress accordingly.",Lauren H
40,Great sunset,"People goes to this iconic venture for the wrong reasons, full of stories and places to snack, but the unique thing about this place is to view beautiful sun sets.",rafcama57
40,Cool to see,Kids had fun on the ferris wheel...neat to walk around and see the sites. Little pricey but what do you expect!,Jayson B
40,Really Fun Half Day Entertainment,"The rides are a bit expensive, but there is plenty to do and see on the pier with shops, restaurants and buskers. We saw the best magician we have ever seen busking on the pier. He blew our minds! The pier gives you great views of the coastline and beach. The old fashioned soda shop is very cool. We also enjoyed watching people fish on the end of the pier. Great spot!",Marty D
40,Always a must,"Even though it’s crowded and crazy with people it always worth a visit. This time I truly enjoyed the jazz music at the end of the pier, super talent guy and very relaxing to sit and watch the ocean and listen to his music",keltickimb
40,Like the movies,Crazy to be in the same spot as we’ve seen so many times in film. It’s a cool pier and the beach is nice too.,Micah Loewen
40,Famous and crowded place,"One of the most famous place in Los Angeles areas, it's always busy and crowded, sometime it's hard to find a parking place. It is family friendly, there is mini amusement park. Nice ocean view.",ClaudioY8
10,Awful,"Ridiculously crowded, sleazy, dirty, and literally nothing to do unless you’re into bad, overpriced tourist-trap food, and crappy, overpriced trinkets. I really wanted to love this place but it’s just awful.",BTrushin
50,Pleasant area,Stopped here mid-morning while passing through Santa Monica and the crowds hadn’t arrived yet so it was pleasantly quiet. The restaurants and food stalls etc had just opened so service was swift and polite.Great walks along Ocean Blvd with nice views of the beach. Shopping n the town was great- lots of brand and boutique stores. Nice modern town and a pleasant area to spend some time,AndyAitch65
40,A must-see,"Everything you expect from the famous Santa Monica pier. Try to be there in the evening when the lights come on as it is quite lovely. Lots of people, of course. We felt very safe at the pier and walking around in the vicinity of the pier, as well",LookingforGilligan
40,Girls getaway,"Took my teenage daughter and her 2 best friends for a final getaway trip for their spring break. Pier was clean, not much foot traffic and everything closed down early. Lights were beautiful at night but was expecting more activity, maybe because it’s their slow time? Girls got bored rather quickly with the activities provided there. Told them summertime would be busier...another reason for another getaway.",KimAndRobby
50,Cool area,"We visited this place because it’s just a place you have to go to while in LA. It was fun, there are many things to do there, specially with kids",Mario
50,Meander on the Pier for great views,"I enjoyed walking along the Pier seeing the sites, street performers and watching people fish. Feel the ocean breeze and ride the roller coaster just for fun. Go midway and look back for great pictures. Beach, Water and a Theme Park! Who can ask for anything more. Yes it is touristy but after all isn't that what I am and I may pass this way only once.",Americanflygirl
20,Touristic and not more,"If you want noise and bad hot dogs, you find the place. Go there with kids if you wish, best is the beach below",Marie C
50,Lovely place,We started at Venice beach and hired bikes to travel the 2.2 miles of promenade which has dedicated cycle roads it was lovely and finished off enjoying all the pier had to offer.,Saffron1971
50,Such a fun place to see,We really enjoyed this mini amusement park on the beach. The ice cream shop there was well worth lining up for and it was such fun.,LeeFamily888
50,Great View ofAtlantic Ocean,Beautiful scene of Atlantic Ocean and ability to dine as well. Ocean breezes bd people watching are sure to please.,sandratilkin
40,Fun but busy,We visited the pier on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The pier was very busy but great for people watching. We rode the Ferris wheel and didn’t have a long wait even though the area was crowded. Beautiful sunset and views!,Mauryt31
50,Great time,Santa Monica pier is great for someone who loves the ocean and amusement parks! Although extremely busy it’s a great place to spend some time. One of my favorite things is feeding the sea lion at the end of the pier. Great view of the beach and some cool shops. I love that their is an arcade,Erin
30,It won't take long to walk to the end if you're pressed for time,We strolled the length of the pier after lunch. It was bustling with tourists but felt safe. There were kiosks with people selling souvenirs and buskers playing various instruments. They did not pester us nor were they pushy. They were definitely part of the atmosphere that was the pier. Our teenagers weren't interested in riding any rides so we left.,LoveToTravelTerrie
40,"Nice, but gets very crowded","We really enjoyed the pier. We did not ride any of the rides, but the atmosphere was a lot of fun. Make sure to look at the carousel! Plenty of street vendors with various wears to keep you interested.",D R
30,All the same,"It's nice to see and is the end of route 66 , but the pier is very tacky and is just the same as pier 49 in San Francisco. Nice for a stroll.",lillyKent
20,Tourist trap,"Fun to visit for a few minutes, but really not much to see of any note. Some of the buskers were very talented (violinist and bass player) but overall very crowded and not worth the effort.",Richard N
30,Interesting entertainment,"Went here in April. It was packed! Too crowed, a little windy too. The people there are entertaining... wow",RyanWoodley
50,Busy!,Visited the Santa Monica Pier on a Wednesday in a week without any holidays or breaks and it was still super crowded! I did enjoy it though and the weather was perfect. Easily accessible to folks taking public transit from Downtown LA... the Expo Line 'Downtown Santa Monica' station is 5-7 minute walk away.,Apocypha
50,Lots of fum,"This is a great place to go if you enjoy being outside and active. We went for the day (took Metro from downtown). Had a great lunch, and rented bikes (very easy to rent parked bikes from city vendors, don’t bother with in person rental shops). We got a bit sunburned but my 17 year old boy really enjoyed it!",Amanda_B109
50,Must see whilst in LA and surrounding areas,"I’ve always wanted to come to Santa Monica pier and it did not disappoint! Lots of great stalls, performers, shops and food places. We watched the sunset from the pier also and it was amazing. I would highly recommend stopping here if you are hosting Santa Monica or are in Los Angeles and neighbouring cities.",Shannon Collyer
50,Iconic Destination,I walk down the pier everytime I hit the beach in Santa Monica. The views up to Malibu are super cool and it's fun to see the fishermen off the pier. And plenty of good food in the restaurants.,Jack Jacoby
50,A must see,Lots of things to so and see and great for people watching. Lots of options for places to eat and drink. Its great that the whole area comes with quick and good wifi.,BeeS_x
50,Beautiful sunset,You must go there to contemplate the sunset at the end of the pier and share with all the people ! Inspirational !,François J
40,Great for jogging,For me this place is great for jogging when we are in LA. You can easily run north for about 5.5 Km or south for around 5 Km. Parking is sometimes expensive and can get to $3 per hour. Ruth Haephrati. Michael Haephrati,Ruth Haephrati
30,Anyone with a WHEELCHAIR,"Born and raised in LA. Been here over 20 times. First time with my 90+ year old grandmother. She is now in a wheelchair. We love going to the end of the pier. This time we took her in the chair and the path was super bumpy. I'm writing this hoping someone will see it and somehow improve the path from a rubber 1 ply condom to something sturdy enough to not shake the retinas out of my grandma's skull. The roller coaster is still fun, but you'll get more a thrill if you have someone push you in a wheelchair down the pier instead.",mb2019
50,Good day out with family!,"Santa Monica is really beautiful and has lots of things to go around and enjoy. To stay with it has beautiful beach and a small fun park with rides for kids and young people. It also has lot of shops for shopping and eating out.Do look out for some performances by some really good artists whether it’s a magic trick or a song rendition or a dance, they all are worth watching (& don’t forget to give couple of dollars or whatever you like the artist is worth of). Keep the art alive guys!!!!",thefastfurious
10,Overcrowded,"This wasn't for us. We didn't come to Santa Monica with overly high expectations but the pier will still below par. We came to the pier both later at night and in the afternoon, both times it was very crowded and there wasn't a lot of room to move. If an amusement park is your thing, then you will like it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend.",Kate
20,"Interesting, great to see some things as I imagined but old and dirty.",Nice to visit and see in person. I kind of wished I came at night as in the day its age shows. From someone that cane from the other side of the world to see it I think Hollywood has given me a false expectation.,Matt G
40,Childhood Dream... kind of...,Santa Monica Pier was one of those must do places for us. It’s a place that we all come up with our own ideas and expectations from images we have seen. It was an ok trip! On the afternoon we went it was freezing cold. The pier was packed full of tourists. It was very different to the what I had imagined. I would recommend going on a warm day or rugging right up. We enjoyed the entertainment on the pier! Awesome photo opportunities 🌸,Karina
40,Great place to enjoy some carnival activities,"My sister and I stopped over in LA and one of the stops we made was at the Santa Monica Pier. It provided a fun carnival atmosphere with beach views on either side. There were different street food and street vendors. I’d recommend is as a place for families, teens and even a good date place to be able to walk around and enough some carnival fare.",dianasanto
40,Nice,"Rides, food, and games galore. Pretty clean and patrolled by local police, so pretty safe. Great views of ocean and coastline.",dshow99
30,Not worth going out of your way for,We liked Santa Monica and the beach is expansive and clean. We walked out on the pier and you get good views back towards Santa Monica and also of the Ocean. Didn't go on any of the rides looked old and worn. The pier is full of tat in the shops and tacky street vendors. The restaurants looked pretty bad as well.Typical tourist trap. Didn't have a car so can't comment on the parking but looked very tight on a busy weekend.,KiwichickAuckland
40,Pier Visit,Cool for a brief stop off but bit tacky overall. Considering end of Route 66 I expected more genuine evidence and less cheap t shirts!,Rob O
50,Beautiful evening!!,This is a must do if you are in the Santa Monica or Los Angeles area! I was lucky to be there on a beautiful evening and was able to see the sunset as well. This is a big pier that is on the beach and even extends into the ocean. You are able to get a great view of the ocean from just about anywhere. There are several restaurants and shops as well as an arcade. You simply can’t go wrong by coming here. I paid 7.00 to park at a parking lot located right next to the pier but it was well worth it.,Isaac M
50,great spot to spend the afternoon,Rented bikes to drive along the beach and ended up walking along the pier. The pier had lots of restaurants and venders. The amusement park was pretty cool! The ferris wheel offers great views of Santa Monica beach. Great for couples or families.,Kyla
30,Huhum!,"If you've been there once, you're better off visiting other/better attractions in the area. Whatever you do, disregard the ""monks"" persistently begging.",Xavier Y
40,"So fun esp for families, great entertainment","Went while in the area. A lot of fun for families (there is a game room, and food vendors like for churros, mango slices, etc.), along with constantly changing entertainers (musicians, jugglers, street dancing, etc.) right on the beautiful ocean that is Santa Monica.",MsCasualTravelor
20,Much Hyped,"I heard a lot about the Santa Monica Pier, but the reality is, it is much hyped. Its just an average pier. Very crowded and lots of street shops and street artists all through the pier walk. You cannot really enjoy the view. If you are around the area make a stop. Don't have to stretch yourself to go here.",Reyelefante
30,Seen one seen them all,"The Santa Monica pier set up was fine. There were several vendors, and performers putting on little shows, then requesting money for watching. There were a few rides, we did not partake in the rides. Parking was avail for a price on the beachfront. We ate at one of the restaurants, it was delicious and reasonable. The gifts stores were pricey. The view was incredible, the beach this time of year is not too busy, however the pier itself was packed. Enjoy it was fun.",MinnaR1
30,"Good Family Fun, Great Sunset",We were visiting LA and were told we should visit the Pier. It is a nice beach and the coast line looks very beautiful. There is nothing spectacular about the pier it self. The amusement park is super expensive (you are betting off putting your money into one of the theme parks). Parking is a big issue. We came there on a weekday very late in the afternoon so we were able to park in the main lot. The Sunset was very beautiful and worth experiencing the moment.,haalio
50,Fun for the whole family,"We spent about four hours at the pier one evening with our two children (3 and 5). There were rides for all of us to enjoy, including small versions for our three year old and a larger roller coaster for adults and older kids. A highlight was definitely riding the Ferris wheel at sunset. There wasn’t much of a line and we hit it just as the sun was setting. After playing arcade games, winning some carnival prizes, and riding the rides, we had dinner right at the pier and walked out to the end of the pier. It’s easy to rack up costs, so it’s worth the unlimited rides wrist band. We ended the night with a round of bumper cars, which worked out great as there is a section for younger kids and a section for adults and older kids - so we all played at the same time.",kelshanman
50,Fabulous pier,"Fabulous pier to visit with lots of cafes, souvenir shops and fairground rides. Quite a few buskers, some better than others.",Janice D
30,Parking tips for Santa Monica Pier,"The pier has its own parking lot, if you turn onto the pier, under the iconic banner sign. You might luck out and park there for $2, or you might have to find street parking further away. This month was my second trip to Santa Monica Pier. The first time I was there was on a hot July day, and the pier's parking lot was full. I found a parking spot on a side street about a half mile south. My second trip was in March. The spring break crowd wasn't big enough to fill the parking lot, so we were happy to pay $2 for the convenience.",Kathy D
40,Great place!,It was ok! It a great place to spend with family and friends but there’s not that many rides for adults. My son did have a great time!,UXR
50,Must do,Had a great day at the Pier. So many fun things to do! Loved the Ferris Wheel. Fun games for kids. Mexican place at end of pier had great margaritas. Nice walk from there to Venice Beach.,EHumphriestravels
30,Doesn’t live up to expectations,"Like so many tourism-hyped places, this one has “just enough” so you’re not totally disappointed but definitely not enough to make this a “top shelf” visit.Thankfully it’s surrounded by amazing beaches and taken together, it’s all good.",FunkyWanderer
30,Cool place bu crowded,This is a cool spot or kids and tourists but very crowded. be sure to plan ahead for parking and be prepared to shell out minimum $20. Other than that it is a cool spot worth checking out,Regina
40,Iconic and very busy,"I recommend going if you’re in the area, but really only to say you’ve done it. I went on a nice sunny weekend and it was a zoo. Pretty cool spot but there’s people everywhere. May be less busy on a weekday, not sure.",Twenty Something Dude
50,Nice place to visit,It was a great day with my daughter. She went to park and we ate ice cream there. There were a lot of artists and entertainments around.,Katya F
40,A fun place to spend an afternoon,"This pier is reminiscent of the parks back east with the food, souvenir stands and the rides. While not as big, it provides a nice way to spend some time with the kids, with the family or on a date. It can get busy and therefore crowded on the weekends. It provides a nice view of the cliffs and the ocean to the north and south.",gjfromwa
50,Santa Monica Pier,Walking on the Santa Monica Pier was worth the hassle trying to figure out how to get in to park. Something to do at least once.,grueninger_karen
30,Okay for what it is,Parking was only $7. We visited in the evening so it was very cold.There is a lot to do if you want to ride and eat.,femster
50,Wonderful!,My favorite place in Los Angeles.. funny place and beach. Wonderful sky and attractions!Excellent foods and stores!,barbaramariavaz
50,You want action ? Go visit Santa Monica Pier!,"This place had a lot going on. If you want to take a calm stroll near the ocean this is not the place to go. That was food vendors, street performes, carousel, people people and more people. We love it! That was those ladies selling mangos ...oh they are so good. My husband had a JapaDog ...it was the bomb","MamaWong, here we go!"
40,Beautiful!,"So beautiful, but WOW there are a lot of drug users everywhere!! It was very busy and so many people, hard to find parking as a lot of lots were full. This was our second visit in three years but there was a different vibe,",WeLTTravel2
50,Loved it!,"Went in early on Sunday morning, was able to find easy parking right on the pier itself for very reasonable pricing. There were a few nice shops and a bunch of merchants around selling different items. Great food options as well, we LOVED Mariasol's! Also enjoyed going to Pacific Park. Highly recommended place to visit in Santa Monica!",LeAnn Kelley
50,Absolutely a must to see,"We went 3 times and it was always as crowded at maximum. So many different people, tourists, inhabitants, artists etcFor us the best time was going about 4 pm and walk there till sunset. We made unforgettable photos and saw all this amazing stores. The highlight for the people who knows “Forrest Gump” the movie is to see Babba Gump Shrimps . We had no chance to get in but the people told it is one of the best- what a movie can move to;-) then a walk at Santa Monica Beach is fantastic at sunset time and take a lot of photos!",Sven-Papa
50,Pier,"Something for everyone but lots of vagrants but no beggingVery busy lots of places to eat, free to enter",Maps192970
30,Bucket List,"This is really a strange thing for me. All of the homeless people kind of take away from the experience. There are also people trying to get you to go on a tour. It is very touristy, but if you are going in Hollywood you should probably check it out.",Michael M
30,Great Views,Stopped here to walk the pier and people watch. Lots of activities for family entertainment. Parking rate was a flat $7 which was fair. There are restaurants on the pier and in the surrounding area. Nice place to get a funnel cake or some ice cream and watch the sun go down. They have some Route 66 ends here sign but the end of old Route 66 is a little further north near the end of Santa Monica Blvd. It’s a short walk from the pier.,Kevin J
50,Visit to the Santa Monica Pier,"After having an excellent lunch at the Bubba Gump Restaurant on the pier, my family enjoyed a walk around the pier and then had a volley ball game on the beach. The beach was clean, the people we met were very pleasant and the weather was perfect..This was a wonderful outing on a rather perfect beach day.",Sam C
40,COLD day,"We stopped by, but the weather was brutally cold, and the wind made hanging out difficult. We explored the interesting but crowded pier. Easy to get twisted around on the highway in, but plenty of parking - for a price. Good to see.",jjjjironstand

50,It was great !!,"My hubby took me to LA this past weekend and we visited the Santa Monica beach! I loved it. It was soooo much to do out there. You can go put feet in the water, ride scooters & bikes, and other activities. Getting to the beach takes soooo long because of traffic, but besides that it was cool",MK TRAVELS
10,Stay Away,"There were long lines in front of the restrooms. Apparently, this is about the only place around for the homeless drug addicts to use the restroom.The place is dirty, filthy, and overcrowded. Parking is three dollars an hour. They let us in the parking lot even though it was full and was backed up from people trying to get back out. It took 30 minutes for us to get back out, and then they charged us for an hour of parking.It’s worth repeating- This appeared to be the only place around for the homeless drug addicts to use the restroom.",ArkansasJohn

10,Every step finds someone selling something,"The view is obscured by vendors offering to carve your name on a grain of rice, write your name in flowers, explain where Jesus is, sell you fruit or churros. Our children love rides but the overall feel was trashy and old and we were done in 15 minutes.We are opting for a less crowded beach that gets us back to nature and away from vendors.",xietsanghua
50,beautiful,"we spend an afternoon there with the kids , a bit of people watching eating churros and ice cream , decided no to do the rides and when for a walk at the beach instead and to our surprise it was fantastic to see a lot of acrobats trains in the beach ...super cool daya must do for me when in L A",OntarioAna
40,Fun afternoon visit,Visit the pier and ride the Ferris wheel for great views. Tickets are $10 each but are worth it. There are other good rides for children.,FunTravelingAround
40,Very beautiful,Although it was a rainy afternoon this location is a very beautiful location. It is worth the visit.,Nuno Oliveira
30,A tourist trap but great people watching,This is free to walk around. We only bought chips (expensive). Nothing against the pier but we don’t enjoy the rides.,Iowatravelfool
30,Don't need much time if not doing rides,"This was a quick stop for us as we didn't go to do the rides. It is an interesting place that seems like you need to see it especially if you are from out of town. There are a lot of food vendors around so go hungry. The view is BEAUTIFUL! It is very windy, rough water and chilly so bring a light jacket. There is parking right off the pier as well as off the beach so you have options. There are public restrooms right on the beach.",Momof2boyz2015
50,Good place to hangout,It has been developed well with good number eateries around it. A wooden bridge that goes straight into the sea. Nice beach which crowded throughout the day. Nice place to click photos & make the visit memorable. There is also a flyer & games section for children.,Nitin K
50,Pier for everyone,Just a great place to walk around and hang out. We were there at sunset and it was beautiful over the Pacific ocean. One more thing bring a jacket. It is usually cooler than inland and there is usually a pretty good breeze.,Dimitar G
40,Bit of history,"This is arguably one of the must go places in L.A. When you're checking what to do this always comes up. The pier itself is a great place to head to, the views are great from both sides and great for photo taking. You can see street performers and other activities as well as the expected rides. The view from the end of the pier is also really good and we loved the painted deck... ... get someone to stand on the steps and take a photo looking down. Great place to wander especially if you have children, very touristy but that's part of the fun",Debra Roberts
40,its a must,"The only way to have a look of Santa Monica,Venice and Pacific Palisades.Besides yo will see many many people from all over the world and very special looks too.You can eat, drink,buy some small gifts and go to the merry go round.Enjoy the beach too!!!",elklix

50,Santa Monica Pier is a must visit for families visiting LA,"Santa Monica Piet is fun for the whole family, complete with an old school fun fair with state of the art Ferris wheel to get the best views over Santa Monica beach all the way to Malibu and beyond. Alternately hours can be whiled away in the gaming arcade with fun for all ages to be had.Local residents can enjoy learning aerial silk trapeze skills there as well as throw a great kids party in the little aquarium downstairs or the beautiful old school Carousel on the pier.There are many and diverse food and restaurant options, my personal favorite being the Mexican restaurant right at the end of the pier, a perfect spot to view a magnificent California sunset over the sea.",Kate J
40,"Still cool, but parking is no fun","IF you have never been it's must do while in Santa Monica. It's where I got engaged so it's a special place for me. The performers and the boardwalk games still steal the show, and it's hard to beat a sunset on the pier.",744Dmack744
50,Fun day at the Santa Monica Pier,"My two teenage girls had a blast riding all the fun rides at the pier. I rode a couple with them myself, then enjoyed relaxing on a bench and watching the beautiful ocean. Great way to spend a beautiful day.",amyblackburn
30,Ok for a day,"Maybe because it was chilly, we didn't really care much for the pier. We were able to buy a few souvenirs and we did see a wedding taking place. There were too few vendors for my liking, but the view was nice.",KentuckyGirl1972

50,The pier is the end of Route 66,"Brilliant place and the end of the iconic Route 66. Lots of shops, street entertainers and funfair. A must visit place if you are in LA",David H
40,Iconic California landmark,"i would say this is a must see because it embodies the California image. However, as a pier for activities, dining etc.. it could be better. The restaurants are okay but overpriced. The rides are fun but not spectacular, But if you leave LA without seeing you will regret it!",DebB818
40,Great SM Pier!,"I had a meeting for lunch in the area, but got there early. Walked around the pier a bit. Looking good on a great spring day! Busy but not too crazy. I thought it was decently clean, seemed safe, etc. Not as seedy as the Venice boardwalk, lol",EricLAX

30,Good and bad,A great pier to visit. Carnival type atmosphere with rides and games. People playing music for tips. My daughter has her name written with symbols. Says recommended 1.00 per letter tip and was told 14.00 for the 6 letters....so be careful with that. Restaurants along the pier. Was a fun place to see and visit not a place I NEED to go back to but definitely fun to see once.,JulieBandSteveB
50,The end of the line,Visted the pier with family felt like a kid again my husband and myself are planning on driving the whole route 66 next year what an adventure,Tammy- L
40,Exactly as expected. Fun few hours.,"We had a warm and sunny day in March. Teens rode the roller coaster. Very busy with people, as expected. Got a few customary touristy photos and walked the beach a bit. Plenty of parking in a nearby lot. Police around keeping the peace. Food options nearby if you don’t want Bubba Gump or pier food. Plan for maybe 2-3 hours. Huge beach but water is chilly.",RCMommy
10,Coney Island Part 2,Where is the beautiful Santa Monica Pier I fell in love with a few years ago? When did masses of people start to trash it? Traffic is reminiscent of the 405 in rush hour traffic. You run into bikes and electric scooters. Flat rate public parking is $25!!! I feel badly every time I see a homeless person. So sad. I needed to walk past the amusement park where the gymnastics beach was to start feeling relaxed.,danicg
50,So much fun!,This was a great place to take my teenage son. He really enjoyed going on the rides and I enjoyed the vendors and the view.,Stacy M

Walk to the endof the pier pose with a large plasticized shark ala Jaws.

50,Must see!,"Interesting entertainment, rides, and vendors on the pier. The beach and view is beautiful. A lot to see and do in one place.",Tricia
10,Dirty contributing to water pollution,There’s honestly no point in going here... nothing fun to do. It’s also really dirty and the bathrooms were also gross. There was trash all over which undoubtedly blows into the ocean sadly. Won’t go back. Really sad that they can’t keep the place clean and people throw trash on the ground. I honestly wouldn’t go back even if it was clean.,Hailey Cox
20,Not Worth It,"When we went, it was in the middle of the summer. The pier itself was very dirty and the bathrooms were horrible. That would not have been a big deal (it is LA after all) except that the amusement park was very disappointing. Nothing worth spending money on to ride. Many homeless people and other patrons line the pier with signs showing their disgust for our government using very colorful language. If you are looking for a nice place to take the family, Santa Monica Pier is not it. The only plus is that there is live music at the end of the Pier.",Julie T
50,Must see for first timers.,"After a disappointing stop for our group at Fisherman's Village, we made our way to the Santa Monica Pier. As it turned out, the time lost at the village was a blessing at the pier. Everyone had a great time.",Gerald R
40,Cool Spot with Lots to Do!,"The pier itself was really cool with lots of shops, attractions, restaurants, and vendors. It was touristy but fun.

50,Always a good time at the pier,"Of course its a very busy tourist spot, but the people watching makes it fun. Parking can be hard to find so just pay to park, its not that expensive. The walk down can be fun and the pier itself offers entertainment. There are great pictures to be taken at day and night although the night pictures offer the lights of the rides in the background. I have not been on the rides but they are reasonably priced for the area. Some souvenir shopping is available. And one time my sister and I rode a bike from Venice to here. That was fun.",tykane01

40,A Must see if you go to Santa Monica,"One of the most iconic places I have always wanted to visit. Yes it’s just a pier, but it has an iconic history and it’s the end of over 2000km of the infamous Route 66. Sit and watch the surfers on Venice and Santa Monica beaches and just take in the scenery. Brilliant!",SagaloutsTour
50,See many as you can,"There are several piers that go from Ventura County through LA County and Orange County. They are unique to Southern California in that there are so many of them and they all seem to be near cousins to each other. Santa Monica Pier is clearly the big glamorous cousin. It's a wonderful way to get a different perspective on the ocean by walking straight out onto it but having the opportunity to look back onto the shore line and city. The ""amusement park"" is probably fun with young kids or if you are a kid at heart but the pier itself is the star. But don't stop here. There are several more that aren't far away that dot the coast both north and south.",StationToStation

30,"Nice Visit, but Bumpy for Wheelchairs","The pier was pretty cool. I use a wheelchair and we went to the parking lot under the pier that's by the beach. It was $7 to park, but I asked about disability parking and the guy said it was free as long as I had my handicap placard. We left it, but I showed him my disability ID and he let us in and told me to put it where it's visible in the dashboard, and warned us that we might get a citation. There's a ramp to get up to the pier and there was also parking on the pier, but I didn't ask about ADA parking. It is a boardwalk (BOARDwalk), so it was super bumpy even with the plastic ""mat"" they had covering the boards as a sidewalk or something. The park was closed and I also didn't ask about accessibility, but they may be accommodating.",tcage26
40,Worthwhile destination,"The in SoCal, this place will pop up as a destination, and it's a good one for walking, people entertainment, sun and water, selfies and Instagrams, and perhaps the amusements on the pier itself. This was a rainy day for me, but I've been there a few other times. It's a good place to see the extent of California beaches, and a glimpse of life here. The actual venues on the pier may be the last thing you actually make use of, unless it's food or your feeling a need to ride the ferris wheel. Worth a stop and nice to get away from the car culture for awhile.",John T
50,Great Place to visit,"If you're traveling to southern California, do visit the Santa Monica Pier. The Pacific Ocean with the mountains in the background has some breath taking views. I will visit again and again, mostly just walked the pier and the beach. It was awesome!",Ladee Vee

40,Must visit if in the area,"One of those must see places. Great setting, at the edge of the ocean, but you have to wade through the masses of tourists and stands selling low grade souvenirs and keep your wallet safe from the occasional pickpockets.The amusement area is probablu fun for kids, I just wasn't with any and I'm not in the right age group for it! ;-)The best time to visit is probably early, when it's quiet and at sunset, when it can be spectacular.",Wahroongan
20,A bit raunchy!,The pier was a bit crazy we saw drugged out women fighting that lasted like 15 minutes and no one seemed to care. A real tourist trap in my opinion with great views of the Pacific.

50,our standard stop when in LA,"when we first visited LA in 2015 we spend some time at the beach next to the Santa Monica Pier and also some time on the PierLoved it and each time we are in LA we need to go backjust the older setting, history, street musicians and all (still listening to a CD bought in 2015)so in 2017 and 2018 we went back, in 2018 even for our newly wed shoot at sunset",Ronald_Carmen
50,Great evening spot,"This pier is vibrant, entertaining and old-school fun any of time day, but especially in the evening when you’ve got all the neon lights glistening in the dark sky, artists playing instruments and people shrieking on the ridesI arrived just after sunset and caught some great views of the Pacific Ocean and the coast before it really comes to lifeYou’re not going to spend 8hrs here unless the weather is spot on, but for an evening of entertainment you can’t go wrong",mongreladam
30,Beautiful but busy,The Santa Monica Pier is a great place to visit if its your first time in Southern California. Its always very very crowded and busy. The beaches below are very nice. Theres several food options and some shopping available on the pier.,JessiAnn85
30,It is just a pier with shops,"It was interesting since I have seen it in movies. However, there is nothing here that really needs to be seen.",TravelDonCA
50,Evening stroll,"We visited the pier at night after the sun set, it wasnt has busy as I was expecting. We did have some cold air. The Ferris Wheel was really fun. Highly recommend, you can see all of the hills, beach and water from up above!",Carlos & Jess
30,Too busy and kind of dirty,"Being an iconic spot it delivers what you might expect. Crowds, lots of litter everywhere and street artists. Prices are ok and there are plenty of restaurants",Juan Facundo B
40,Fun,"1st time here. It was clean and fun. Great views from the pier. Rides looked fun for children, but unsure as we weren't there with any.",Carrie M

40,Love atmosphere of Santa Monica,"Easy to catch Big Blu Bus 🚎 from Hotel near LAX, $1 scenic drive through Marina Del Ray & Venice (grungy by beach) - Santa Monica Amart cafes & shopping & touristy Pier a must see. Buskers were performing at entry to pier - athletic & entertaining.",Lorraine B
30,Average -Old- Dirty,Was staying in Anaheim and decided to pop over to the coast to see the Pacific. Decided on Santa Monica...looked fun so off we go. Disappointed at arrival. Amusement area old and tired. Would not go back and would not rocommend,jag18834
30,"Well, it's just a pier","Nothing special, a few attractions for kids, a few restaurants or food stalls and some artists such as singers musicians.",Tobias K
30,Iconic but so-so,"We went to the must-see pier and were a little underwhelmed. It had everything a tourist trap needs: souvenir shops, arcades, street performers, photo ops, and food. With all of the other beautiful things to do in the area, there was nothing to keep us here for more than 20 minutes, since we weren’t hungry.",JenRed2014
50,Fantastic!,We loved Santa Monica pier! There are plenty to see and do and our only regret was staying too short time. We'd love coming back and spend at least a whole weekend near Santa Monica Pier.,WanderlusTee
20,Too crowded,"This place used to be a great place to people watch. It is now incredibly annoying due to over population. It is incredibly dirty. However, the good thing is that it is only blocks from Santa Monica promenade. I would suggest going to the promenade. A couple of seafood restaurants.",Dreamer803041
40,California's oldest amusement pier !,"Built in 1908, Santa Monica Pier is California's oldest amusement pier and well worth checking out if you are in the area. There are various gaming stalls and eateries as you walk along the boarded pier deck while the Pacific Park amusement park houses a solar powered Ferris wheel along with other rides. The pier also marks the western terminus f Route 66 and a sign stating this is a popular photo point.",Ste M
50,great scenery,beautiful views of the beach and ocean. the pier itself has the feel of the old time carnivals. great fun walking around and taking in all of the sights and sounds,raswaim
50,Highschoolers on a trip,"Definitely not to be missed with the famous Route 66 sign and the pier. Always crowded, but worth a visit. Shopping is at hand's reach as well as food courts. Inexpensive bike rental available, I'd suggest a bike ride to the close-by Venice beach.",ursa p
50,Susanadana,I went last year I love this beach park is so nice restaurants we at at bubba Gump great food it was early in morning and family gathering great service there is also a Mexican restaurant before pier that sells lobster enchiladas. I apologize for not remembering name my sister took me for my birthday there 2 years ago. The pier is very nice and clean rides updated homes around here are beautiful such a great atmosphere to me I think this beach is the cream of the crop if you have never been here it for sure a must visit,Susana L
40,Crowded and overhyped,We arrived around 11:30 am by Uber and there was already quite a few people packed onto the pier. Not quiet shoulder to shoulder but certain spots were that way.The view to the north is quite nice on the pier and used that for some photo ops.We walked to the south for some impressive photos of the pier from a distance. Perhaps 1-3 miles?Lots of people wanting your money on the pier doing all kinds of things for it.Never tried the food or rides; although they seemed good.,Kristian
50,Beautiful pier and beach view,"The pier itself is beautiful.We got there on a sunny day and the view was clear and great.It is a very calm place, even with all the people around.You can go on the rides or just walk around, listen to the streep performances and buy souvenirs.",Lotan P
50,Just loved it?,"What a great place on a sunny day. Fantastic atmosphere reminiscent of long ago. So busy with families, the young the old! Seaside atmosphere, entertainers, ice creams, it has it all.Icing on the cake Buppa Gump? Made our day!",Chrissie77
40,A California must do!,My husband and I came here for the day. We ate lunch at one of the restaurants at the beginning of the pier. Ended up having a funnel cake on their pier. We rode the Ferris wheel which was fun. $10 per person though.,Linda M
50,Loved it,"Santa Monica pier was lovely and just like in the movies. The pier is big, colourful and lively. There's lots going on. Some good restraunts and beautiful views. We see some seals playing in the water. It was magical. The sunset was also beautiful. A must if your in LA",ALCBS
40,Worthwhile,It’s a worthwhile walk from Venice beach to the pier but it is worth the walk seeing all the people working out and entertaining people .,kevchezza
30,Just okay,"We really wanted to see the pier and enjoy the beach on our recent visit to LA but the pier just wasn't as exciting as I remember and my kids weren't all that impressed. Maybe a better experience for younger kids, but my 10 and 17 yr olds weren't too excited.",EHayes575
40,Santa Monica Pier,"We visited the SM pier on Friday, Feb. 15 and enjoyed our time at the pier. It was late morning and into the early afternoon. The pier was built so but not over crowded. We were able to move around and saw some spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean up close. There are some amusement park rides - but we did not ride any of the rides. 6-10 restaurants were open and cooking up lunch. We had a drink at Bubba Gump's- which was enjoyable.",Titan11Omaha
30,Nice place but best to see from the distance,The pier is nice and very iconic but we preferred to stay down on the beach and have it as background for some nice pictures.,Life of Daniel
30,Ticked it off the bucket list but didn’t stick around.,"Didn’t spend a great deal of time here as very tacky and commercial with lots of crappy souvenirs and cruddy buskers. Was a good old school game arcade to spend some time in but a lot of the machines were out of order. Loads of people but easy to get around, didn’t spend a long time here. Pier is a little tired.",Melanie D
40,Walk on the pier,Beautiful but too crowded. The sunset is absolutely beautiful. Lots of vendors and performers of all kinds on the pier. Not a quiet place for sure but happy we saw it and visited Santa Monica,Helena G
50,A Perfect Family's Place,"Santa Monica Pier is the must see place if one visits this beautiful city. A well maintained structure accommodating an imposing Ferris wheel, good restaurants and food outlets, gift shops and lively activities attract tourists from all walks of life. The weekends in particular turn into festivities.",Sufee Ahmed
30,Nice but very crowded !,"We decided to go on a Friday night, it was very crowded.The sun was setting so we did get some nice pictures.It's worth the visit but be ready for a lot of people.Parking is a challenge but you can find structures with valet.If you want to self park in the streets .... a bit more difficult.I wouldn't go there just for the Pier. There are a lot of restaurants in the area and the Promenade. The Pier is part of the trip, but not the focal point.",FTichy
40,Nice but not wow,Just my own opinion but I wasn’t blown away with the pier. It’s definitely a place to go and have a look but wouldn’t rush to recommend as much as the other places we have visited. Has rides and restaurants but nothing we don’t get in Brighton!,mrsvikki23
50,Go Back In Time,"When America was more innocent, the County Fair was a rite of passage. Today, you can find the Ferris wheel, the merry go round, the salt water taffy stand and a host of humanity at the Santa Monica Pier. Located where Route 66 intersects with Pacific Coast Highway, there are high and low dining options, games to play (and prizes to win for that someone special), as well as shopping opportunities that range from kitsch to memorable.An easy date, a way to escape the day-to-day, a place to collect your thoughts or just enjoy the shrieks of happy people on rides, this is a one-size-fits-all proposition. With the Pacific Ocean below, nature is the costar -- and it's a great balance to the carny awesome of the rides/contests.A good way to hook back into a gentler time, the Pier remains a getaway that's not that far away from Malibu, Brentwood, Ventura, Hollywood, etc.",LadyGoodman615
10,Very touristy!,"Not worth going there, it is very touristy and actually not much to do there. Also, I wouldn‘t stay for a lunch there",TravelerLux007
30,"Tacky, good views",Not my most favourite location. I found the area quite tacky and not the most pleasant of areas to spend a day. Great views at the back of the pier of the Pacific. Some great local entertainment dotted along the pier.Worth a visit but don’t plan on spending too long here.,gazza2209
30,"Too crowded, touristy","This was kinda disappointing. Sure we were there early afternoon on a nice Saturday afternoon few days of crummy weather , but it was so crowded it was hard to walk and enjoy the surroundings.The view of the beach and ocean are beautiful. Aim for a less crowded time to visit.",Mike95128
40,Lots going on at sunset,We visited just before sunset and it was very busy on the pier. There are lots of shops and some restaurants plus all the amusements. The lights on the rides were lit up in Christmas colours which was very festive,jaynic
40,Great place to visit,"Such a vibrant place to spend a good few hours. Lots of shops, eateries and entertainment. Some of the buskers that preformed here were amazing. You can get some great photos from the ferris wheel. Such a must do for an iconic place.",Angels_Are_Devious
40,"Fun, especially for kids!","Rides and games in a beautiful atmosphere surrounded by the ocean, also beautiful light designs on the ferris wheel at night. Amusement park foods like ice cream and funnel cakes available along with street entertaiment, some of which is funny, but also some very good musicians. Can walk down steps and be right on the beach and ocean front bike path. Gets super crowded in summer, so if you want to miss the thickest crowds go during the week.",Miriam F
50,Pier,"If you want to just gaze at the ocean( there is a high chance that you can see sea lions), watch the shore, grab a bite, or try some of the rides including the famous Ferris wheel, which is lit up at nights, this place is for you.",AlaraAygen
50,Fun place,We went in Feb so it was on the cooler side for California but it did t stop us from putting our feet in the pacific water. The pier was crowded even though the amusements were not open. Still a fun place to visit and great for people watching. Lots to do in and around the pier.,Krissyalx
50,Fun Weekend,Great spot to relax and have fun with friends. Eat swim enjoy the sun and just bum around for the day,Robert Sudakow
50,Great place,I loved walking on the pier. it was in the evening in February so not real busy. Fun place to go see with friends,angiel137
30,"Just too busy, go to Malibu pier","The pier would best be visited first thing in the morning when the hordes have not descended on to it. We got there about 1:30 and it was just so busy and you had to move like a snake and weave your way through the crowds. As you weave your way you are bombarded with an assortment of ""professionals"" all signing or shouting one thing or another. None of them where any good but all seemed to have very good speakers to assault your ears. Once at the end of the pier trying to get any photo without people just walking infant or even stopping to take photos was impossible. as i say first thing in the morning would allow you to take your time and see the pier and all it has to offer. The best bit for me was hiring bikes on the pier and then cycling along to Venice beach. However, it's not what you'd call cheap to hire a bike for an hour but if you have the cash its a really nice way to get to Venice",Drew M
30,Ok for a brief visit,"Having visited Venice Beach and been very disappointed, we then walked along the beach path to Santa Monica and visited the Pier. The Pier is very busy, full of tourists from California and beyond. It was nice to walk out beyond the shoreline but was very busy and hard to find a quiet spot. The food options are standard fast food and the prices of the souvenirs are twice the price of Beverly Hills. (how does that work) Our daughter wanted to buy a Los Angeles sign which was $14 or $15 on the pier so she ended up buying it at a mall in Beverly Hills for $7.Santa Monica is a hefty Uber drive from West Hollywood or Beverly Hills and takes approx. 45mins due to LA consistent traffic. For this reason, this is not a must visit if you only have a couple of days in LA.",toddtrippas
40,Must see attraction in L.A.,"This is an attraction that's worth visiting if you want to at least get an iconic experience in the L.A. area. The pier is the end of the line for the famous Route 66. It has an amusement park, restaurants, people watching, a beach, and more. It's not very clean and kind of has an old boardwalk feel to it",Nick D
50,Vacation again,"A bit windy that day, but as always a great place to visit. The hamburgers at Pier Burger were exceptional. The pier is always a planned stop for us when in LA.",lfwalz
50,"Beautiful, entertaining, fun for the whole family!",Took the whole family to the Santa Monica pier as one of many stops on a very long road trip! Ended up being one of the funnest and most memorable stops on our trip! The roller coaster out on the pier is a must! You won’t be disappointed!,Dumak
50,Santa Monica Pier,"Took an Uber from LA. And had a delightful day wandering around. It was just fun to see the ocean, the people and all the attractions. Disappointed that I couldn’t ride the Ferris wheel because I was a single. So many places to eat. I had no idea that Route 66 ended there. Then I wandered around the area. Little treasures everywhere. A definite destination if you are in the area.",SusanL49120
40,Amazingly beautiful,"Pacific ocean was mesmerizing, as well as the flock of birds. There’s a public parking near the pier. We went there in the afternoon and left before the evening lights. It’s great for families as there’s a lot of activities and street performers. Just beware of the bird poop and scammers.",Apple F
40,Fun!,Super fun experience!! Happy we stopped in! The bubba gump restaurant was fantastic and the views were beautiful from pier! We will be back with kids to ride the rides!,downum93
30,Entertaining Pier,"What can a pier be, well exciting, colorful, crowded great place to people watch. It was not a place I would make a point or go out of my way to visit but if you are in the area it is free to walk on and doesn’t take much time to walk tothe end so take the opportunity.",GLENNA B

30,7 day visit to Santa monica,"Went to the pier on a few occasions,it was ok .Once you have been on there 1st time that’s it seen it and done it.The problem going on there was the guys so called giving away CD for a donation and they do drive you mad ,just say no thanks and keep walkingPrices of the food on there are extortionate 15$ for a hot dog .",marion25
40,Great place to see,We enjoyed our time here. The sunset was beautiful. We had dinner at the Albright the seafood was good as was the hamburger I had. We found it was a bit pricey and the service was not great. The pier is very clean if you haven’t seen it yet then you should check it out.,cruiser154995
40,World famous ( i don’t know why?),The pier has several down tempo attractions. Young kids I’m sure will have a grand time on some of the rides. I only have one caveat.... the Ferris wheel is worth the wait to ride on. Marvellous city and ocean views when at the top of the ride.,H H
50,California experience,"On my second visit to Santa Monica Pier the Los Angeles experience is in the air. To see people from all walks of life coming to visit Santa Monica beaches, shopping for souvenirs and American sandwiches on the pier builds peace in me and how I wish the whole world was just as peaceful!",PaulMM
50,Iconic!,"World famous attraction. Miles of golden beaches, attractions on the pier. Enough to keep you occupied all day with the kids",dsasto
50,Winter visit,It was freezing when we went but there were still so many people out. Lots of food trucks to nibble on or walk on the beach. Souvenir shops and indoor eating too. Try The Lobster at the beginning of the pier if you miss a Boston-type steamed lobster dish.,happiestprawn79
20,Bucket list! The end of Rt 66.,"Since we lived at Lexington, Illinois on route 66 where I was a Chevrolet dealer seeing the end of route 66 was a must do! We went there at night which was probably the most advisable so that the attraction was more palatable. The bathrooms at the ocean end of the pier should be condemned, and which ever “department of toilets” in California is in charge of them should be embarrassed that they let the public go in there.It’s one of those bathrooms were you can taste the urine in the air!Now here comes a serious idea that would work: Why don’t whoever is the decision-maker regarding those bathrooms at the Santa Monica pier go out and buy custom made trailer, with self contained toilets like the “stars” use and when they get really dirty they can just be pulled off site if need be. Then the other ones can be inserted in for while for their duty while the dirty ones are cleaned. That way you don’t have to work within the confines of that small Chickenshack building where you have had your toilets from 1920. There just is no way to make that thing usable for the crowds that you deal with on a daily basis.",shawn m
40,Commercial w/o being junky,"Street performers, vendors and every different walk of life. Lots to see & do for everyone. It was a beautiful early evening when we visited the peer- we walked the length of it easily. We stopped to look at things along the way & snap pictures. The view of the beach is beautiful from the peer. A must do if you’re in Santa Monica.",Wendy Z
40,Very much for the tourists. The End of Route 66,"If you enjoy the all the tourists & the opportunity to take 10 minutes or 1 hour out of the day to sit & enjoy the LA sunshine.Fantastic day out, I would suggest pass on the Tourist Food Shops & go 100 meters to Big Deans Ocean Front Cafe for a cold beer, great Buffalo Wings & a pretty good Double Cheese Burger... easy listening music with sport of TV",ceowarren
50,Vibrant atmosphere and lots of things to do !,"The pier gives unlimited views of the Pacific Ocean. The walkway is dotted with trendy cafes, bars and places for souvenir shopping. You could even catch some great performances by street dancers and entertainers. There is a games arcade as well as rides right at the walkway to the pier.",Sharmila82
40,An Iconic Place to Visit,"The weather wasn't the best when we visited the pier - rain and wind that dampened our trip. All in all it was an interesting walk but I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of businesses as it was the same thing over and over. The buskers were great - some real talent, that's for sure. We has planned on going to the aquarium the next day but the weather got worse so we didn't.",MaPuJe
30,Cool place to visit,"Cool place to visit when in Santa Monica. We stopped here late afternoon on our way back from Malibu. There is only paid parking, but there is a parking lot close to the pier that is for short term (1-2 hours) and is only $1/ hour. Fun to walk around the beach and on the pier. There are rides, but we never went on them or saw how much tickets were. Lots of little booths with food and souvenirs. Great place to watch the sunset. We even had a little seal swim around below us!",Leanne H
50,Lovely Iconic Pier!,"Just west of downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica contains one of the most legendary beach scenes in the United States. We loved it so much. how American this place is! It also reminded me of Grand Theft Auto V.",Christopher S
50,Great landmark! Not to be missed!!,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic landmark where the famous Route 66 ends!A super cool fun place for all visitors and more so if you have kids.Navigation is really easy; parking at pier is not free; colorful shops all around (see the pictures I posted where in you could see beautiful reflections) and most importantly amazing views directly from the end of the pier or from the beach sideSuggest you plan to spend a couple of hours in the evening and time it in such a way that you could watch the beautiful sunset over the Pacific. Then, you can grab a good dinner in one of the Santa Monica downtown restaurants (Lots of options!)Strongly recommended if you visit the Los Angeles area and especially if want to do something outside the Universal or Disney attractions",Kalyan Peri
50,Great finish to end of Route 66,"Kind of a let down for me. After driving nearly 2500 miles in 17 days and seeing as much of Route 66 as I could in that time, there should have been a band to meet me! I did talk with the gentleman who was working the Route 66 kiosk that day and received a ""Road Scholar"" certificate for completing Route 66! Great little place. They sold a lot of Route 66 material and advertised the road.Of course, the obligatory picture of me at the End of Route 66 sign. (Since I was traveling alone, had a bit of a problem finding someone to take my picture!)The pier was great to visit. Musicians playing for money, people walking around on the pier. The carnival operating. Great view of the Pacific. Just had a great time doing my own celebration for completing the road.I have a number of pictures but there are already so many posted here!",Stan W

30,Well worth a look,After a walk along a quiet beach the pier was more lively and getting into its stride for the day with all the regular hustle and bustle and street performers etc. Worthy of special note is the little kiosk selling Route 66 stuff (the pier is the west end of the route) as well as a shop it is a fount of knowledge about the route as they guy who runs it is an expert.,Glyn

50,Near Perfect,"A friend of mine brought me to Santa Monica on my first trip to Los Angeles. The pier was great. It was a little crowded on a Sunday night but that is to be expected. It is a feast for the eyes and ears to see the attractions and lights and the sounds of the musicians lining the pier. We arrived right at sundown so there was a beautiful sunset as we made our way out to the very end of the pier. It was so picturesque. Though we didn’t stop in any of the stores or buy any food or go on the ferris wheel, we had a great time at the pier and I would visit it again my next trip to Santa Monica.",SUBZEROSKIDD10
50,"Great and fun, but be careful at night","I went to Santa Monica Pier with my friend at night. I've gone there and had wonderful experiences at night before. I still had a great experience. I don't mind the travelers of life without home, but when they have a blanket over their left shoulder, are muttering to themselves and are walking at a very quick pace straight at you and there is no one in a 50 to 100 foot radius to help, run! Nothing negative happened in that scenario, because I ran. If you stay in the lit areas where people are, it's great.I gave one gentleman who is a traveler of life without a home base a dollar after asking him how he ended up where he is. What he said sounded genuine. Now back to the true essence of the pier. Bubba gumps is delicious! The arcade in itself is fun, but one of the employees or owners is high on power and does not know California law, so he tries to enforce what he believes law is when it comes to photography. I politely turned my camera off while I was on his property, but when he came back and said he would call the police after I already did what he asked... that wasn't pleasant as I had done nothing against the law.",zudasworld
50,Exudes the Southern California vibe,"Perhaps there’s no place that exudes the Southern California vibe better than the celebrated Santa Monica Pier. The first concrete Pier on the West Coast, it goes back a century and more – the 1600-foot long boardwalk was opened to the public in 1909.On the Pier’s opening day, the highlight apparently was the running, swimming and boating events judged by legendary surfer George Freeth (you can read more about him in my review of Redondo Beach Pier).Set at Santa Monica’s westernmost point and packed with family-friendly activities, shops, restaurants, the Pier also offers amazing views and a century worth of history. The ramp located at the intersection of Ocean Avenue and Colorado Avenue goes down to the Pier. All along the Pier there are several performers, each one providing novel, often very topical entertainment.Some fun Pier trivia: There actually was a Battle of Santa Monica Bay – not a military operation though – it was a 1939 raid on mob boss Tony Cornero’s offshore gambling operations led by Attorney General Earl Warren.If you are here for the first time, best is to start your visit with the Santa Monica Pier Shop & Visitor Center – you can get maps, visitor guides and talk to friendly, knowledgeable people who are happy to help out with whatever you would like to know or do.Must-have photographs: In 1941 the Santa Monica Yacht Harbour sign was unveiled which has become the perfect spot for that souvenir photograph. In 2009, Santa Monica Pier was dedicated as the official western end of trail of the famous Route 66 – you just have to be photographed here too, right in front of the Route 66 sign! And of course, on the eight-pointed blue and white star with Santa Monica Pier painted at its center, right at the end of the Pier. Apart from these, there are dozens of spots where you can get the most amazing snaps.Pacific Park at the Pier is a full-service amusement park with bars, restaurants, souvenir shops, entertainment arcade and so on. All this set against a beautiful, almost endless Pacific Ocean. Admission to Pacific Park is free – individual rides and attractions are priced in the $5-$10 range.Pacific Park hours vary on account of weather, private events and by season – so it is best to check out the operating times on their website for the date when you plan to be there. However, they are invariably open 11am-7pm on weekdays and 11am-9pm on weekends.Pacific Park offers a selection of 12 rides. Some of the best are:- The West Coaster roller coaster that goes up to a height of 55 feet and provides amazing views of the bay and the ocean as it zips from one end of the Park to the other.- The Pacific Wheel Ferris wheel - The iconic red and yellow Ferris wheel at Pacific Park has been photographed more than any other in the world for sure! The world’s only solar-powered Ferris wheel, it goes up a dizzying 130 feet above the Pier offering panoramic views of the coastline- The exhilarating Pacific Plunge tower ride has two gondolas with five seats each that take riders up 90 feet before the plunge – enjoy the feeling of being almost weightless- The bench-like Seaside Swing seats 16 and sways in a 45-degree arc even as it showcases an amazing ocean view extending from Palos Verdes Peninsula to Santa Monica MountainsOne of the not to be missed attractions at the Pier is the carousel. The Looff Hippodrome built in 1916 is the oldest building on the Pier. The Hippodrome is a National Historic Landmark. Located within the Hippodrome, is the Looff Carousel. A vintage carousel dating back to 1939 (!) it has 44 horses, 1 rabbit, 2 sleighs and 1 goat. Incidentally, the Looff Hippodrome Carousel is where Paul Newman is seen working in ‘The Sting’.The Santa Monica Pier Aquarium is located at beach level just below the carousel – it is relatively small but is well worth visiting especially if you have children with you. Dedicated to protecting the animals found in the Bay, there are over 100 local species on display with hands-on activities for children. Adults and children above 13 pay $5 admission, while children 12 and under get in free. The aquarium is open Tuesday through Friday 2pm-5pm and on weekends 1230pm-5pm. Closed on Mondays.If you are up to it and want to fly through the air, get to the Trapeze School of New York at Santa Monica Pier. They offer two-hour long classes taught in groups of 10 people. Casual flyer or serious aerialist, thrill seeker to couch potato, the school is open for everyone - no prior experience is needed but you do need to be over 6 years old. The school is open 8.30am to 10pm on all days.Fishing is very popular at Santa Monica Pier. You can rent gear, poles, bait and you don’t need a fishing licence to drop a line off the Pier!A day of fun at the Pier can work up a real big appetite. Apart from the Pacific Park food court that serves typical amusement park fare, food carts and food hawkers on the Pier, there is also a delectable selection of restaurants and cuisines. People eat here as much for the views as for the food.Some well known restaurants:- Mariasol Cocina Mexicana – margaritas, tacos and other Mexican cuisine at this Baja cantina with absolutely stunning views- Bubba Gump Shrimp Co – the family friendly sea food chain is perfectly in place on the pier- The Albright – family-run restaurant that offers sea food, farm to table fare, local wine and craft beers- PierBurger – have a burger or a cheese dog on the outside patio of this vintage-style burger place- Soda Jerks – within the carousel building, have an ice-cream soda at this vintage-inspired soda fountainAnd if you don’t want any of this, grab some hot churros from one of the Mexican Senoras who sell them on the Pier, or get yourself some cotton candy and life’s just good!If you are at the Pier, souvenirs of course are a must – apart from the Pier Shop and Visitor Center, there are at least four or five shops selling a range of wonderful keepsakes. You just can’t miss them – get a carousel memento, magnets, post cards, crystal, shells.Stay around at the Pier past sunset for that perfect relaxed evening when the views of Malibu and the South Bay are at their best … if you’re lucky you might even catch the strains of live local music floating in the air, keeping time with the background chorus of the waves.",TMenon
50,California TOTAL!,"S Monica Pier is pretty cool!For sure is the place more-california around all the state.The park is good, and also have good food. I recommend the Unlimited-Wristband to rides, because for each one is more expensive.Try the roller coaster to check the sunser, amazing!",Fernando Carvalho
30,Not the fantastic attraction I was expecting.,"The old pier is not as big as I thought it was going to be. Offers a fair ground, @ few side stalls, a couple of cafes and not a lot else. There is parking on the pier.",SUZANNE T
50,Fun place with great view!,Had to visit the pier while in the area and rode the Ferris wheel and ate dinner at Marisol at the end of the pier.,loribledsoe
40,Interesting Place,"The pier is a fun place to visit, especially with kids. The amusement park on the pier is cool. There lots of food options in the area as well.",Amanda454
40,Iconic.,This iconic LA location is a must so you can “touch” the Pacific Ocean. It’s a throwback to another time but remains vibrant and uniquely Los Angeles.,Jamfam18
40,Lovely beach,The pier in itself wasn’t overly impressive but it’s a really nice place to sit and either read or watch the world go by. The beach walk to the pier is also really nice and was a highlight for me,jilly_bean_1981
40,Great to walk around and see the attractions,"This pier is definitely bigger than the average pier in the US. It also features a lot of stores and attractions. You can take a picture on the Route 66 sign. There are also great artists showing their work on the pier. The place can be really crowded during weekends, so be prepared.",gussch1987
40,Cute Pier,Although the fairground part was closed this was still worth a visit.I enjoyed reading about the history of the pier.Maybe a map of what is out to sea would enhance the experience?,vonireland
50,Exquisite!,"Absolutely beautiful! We both enjoyed a full day at the pier and beach. Good transport links, so if you're staying in the area it's very easy to get to with public transport.""Exquisite artwork! I really like the attention to detail"" - lifeguard compliment my sand art x :)",Lorna M
50,Sunshine Day,"Wasn’t sure about the ‘tourist trap’ of Santa Monica Pier and yes, there are certainly plenty of tourist traps there but it was so worth the visit. Spent a sunny afternoon, in the middle of a month long trip circumnavigating the globe, watching sandpipers chase crabs in the waves and eating tacos in the sunshine. Pure Joy.",Susan K
50,Very good,"Weather was very good, it was weekend and everybody was enjoying. Especially bubpa gump shop was amazing. Very good weekend for families with kids.",Siyami
50,Holiday in LA,LOVED the bike rental. Had a great dayProbably wouldn't come here at night as i heard it can be dangerous and food options arent great but amazing day,sophieb0855
50,Woo!,"Oh Santa Monica, how I wish I had more time to enjoy all that you had to offer; rides, shops, food, the rental bikes and scooters, the beautiful water and sand...The beach is free and has plenty of room for everyone. It's great to visit both at night, when the rides and signs are all it up, as well as in the day, when you can lie on the beach and tan or take a swim on the Pacific Ocean. Santa Monica Pier is between the Third St. Promenade and Venice beach. One can start early, starting on the Venice side and work your way you way through all three. That'll be my goal next time Tip: download the bike rental app and Venice app",Candibuttnz
50,30 day rd trip,It was our first stop at the Ocean on our 30 day road trip I loved it I put my feet in the Ocean. Good times,Robin W
30,You should see it just once,As the end of Route 66 this is a well known spot. In from Kansas City we had to visit and say we did it. Lots of shops and restaurants. Attractions are fun and family friendly. Best part was watching the ocean from the end and reading the history of the pier. Lots of photography opportunities and safe atmosphere.,Firefighter4238
50,"I came to the Santa Monica Pier on the Sunday morning. There was no traffic, and it was quiet.","The Pier is long with many different rides and restaurants. There are also bathrooms. It is windy, but it is not too cold. I wanted to go on the Ferris wheel, but it was closed when I got there. I think that much of the park opens at or about 11:00 AM. The parking at the Pier costs ten dollars ($10.00), but there is limited street parking which is free. One is able to even wade or to go into the Pacific Ocean, although the water is cold and very choppy. I just dunked my feet into the water! The views of the nearby hills, in addition to the views of Venice and Malibu, were all amazing.",TennisStar602
40,No Pier Preshure,We really enjoyed it. The pier can be a very busy place. We arrived late evening and walked past the many shops. We were only going aight see but ended up eating dinner at a Mexican Restaurant at the very end of the pier. The food was great and the prices reasonable for Santa Monica.,Tim N
50,Nice View,"You can walk to see the sea here by walking along to the big wood bacolny.On the way have the souvenir shop,fun park and game zone with little restaurant.This here is very nice view of big blue sea.",Jay To
50,Very crowded on a saturday,Better to come on a weekday. Did not enjoy it so much because it was too crowded. Just had a drink and stopped by a small shop to buy souvenirs. That's it.,Mallorcababe
50,Amazing sunset view!,The sunset from the pier offers beautiful photo opportunity so make sure you don't miss it. Parking can get difficult in the evening so try to come in early to park near the pier. Lot of food shops and rides. Lovely place to easily spend a few hours.,FoodieTillIDie
50,"Wow, a lot of people!",Was fun to visit. The sights and sounds can't be described. It was fun people watching and listening to different people's take on the situation. Well worth the visit.,NWO Traveler
40,Nice Pier,"The Santa Monica Pier is an iconic landmark, and it was nice to see! A lot of tourists flock here, but you should check it out if you have the time. The area has good restaurants and even better views.",Chris
40,"crazy, busy - don't miss!",wouldn't want to spend every day here - but fun for a few hours. Great place to people watch. Lots of activity and even some talented musicians.,LoveMyFamily6
50,Favorite vacation location,"Lively and fun, so much to do, fun rides, beautiful sunsets. Amazing views and homes around the area. Unique beach with a carnival on the pier. ❤️",Faithy
30,Enjoying a Walk,"Being from the ""Jersey Shore"" this pier brought back some fond memories. It was fun to stroll around and see the varied activities going on. While in the area, a worthwhile stroll.",kalickisj
30,Holiday with our Granddaughter,"Spent a few hours at the pier, my husband and granddaughter went on a few rides. There were plenty of places to eat.",Positano15
40,Awesome,"Must see location, well worth the drive and time loved it. Beautiful, well kept, fun, and the grounds are stunning.",fretwellmike
40,A must-see when in LA w/teens,"It was fantastic to finally see in person one of the most iconic LA sites. We parked in public parking place on 4th street and Colorado Ave (across Bloomingdales) maybe it was $12 parking fee. I was surprised how the Santa Monica Pier reminded me of the old Long Branch beach/pier in NJ that I frequented as a kid before the NJ pier sadly burned down. The ambiance made me nostalgic. The sites and sounds of the games and rides were great to take in. We went late in the afternoon and stuck around for the sunset, which was amazing but it was unfortunately quickly eclipsed by the smoky clouds of the horrific wildfires. I also took notice that many locals also go at sunset after work to relax on the beach in their business attire. We did some souvenir shopping and then walked a few blocks up to the Third Street Promenade for more shopping and some snacks. It’s a great outdoor shopping plaza!",gigi0904
50,Nice place to visit!,"This is a iconic place you must visit if in Santa Monica. If Hollywood movies are your thing you will recognize this pier (google it and you will see that the Santa Monica pier was a filming location for several good movies). You will also find several restaurants to choose from, local artists, nice fishing spots and a beautiful beach. We ended up having lunch at Bubba Gump when we were there. We really enjoyed our choice, specially because we like the Forrest Gump movie.Este é um lugar icônico que precisa ser visitado se vc estiver em Santa Monica. Se vc gosta dos filmes Hollywoodianos tem grandes chances de vc reconhecer esse pier (pesquise no Google e vc vai ver que o Santa Mônica pier foi usado em vários filmes). Vc também vai encontrar vários restaurantes, artistas locais, pontos para pescar e uma praia maravilhosa. Nós acabamos almoçando no Bubba Gump quando visitamos o píer e gostamos muito de nossa escolha, especialmente pq somos fans de Forrest Gump.",Minardi
50,"Early Morning to miss the crowds was worth it, then Lunch at Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co.","Took an Uber to Santa Monica around 0630 am and was pleasantly surprised by the Pier at this hour and the fact that we had time to walk around and enjoy the views without the crowds that appeared later. Was very impressed with the amount of Bikes/Scooters etc that you could also hire from as little as 15 cents per minute. It was a beautiful relaxing morning and then a leisurely walk along Venus Beach. highly recommend, would also have been nice to venture to Malibu if we had the time. Unfortunate part of the whole USA Holiday was the depreciation in the Australian Dollar. Wont think of travelling again to the US until this changes, way to costly.",Christine E
40,Great parking if you get there early,Pier parking was a maximum of $12 for the day on a beautiful winter Sunday. Well worth it for location between the pier and 3rd Street promendae. Both good places for strolling and people watching.,bfindysz
40,A little pier with big personality!,"Us locals are good with it and have been for many many decades, but as a 'tourist attraction' it may disappoint. I can't recommend a meal at Bubba Gump's unless you're drinking the 'tourist kool-aid', but catch a sunset on the ferris wheel and you'll understand why the locals love it so. The end of Route 66, featured in such video games as Vampire Masquerade and Grand Theft Auto, and featured in films such as Elmer Gantry and The Sting.",CountesssChristine
50,Excellent fun,"This is a great place to visit in Santa Monica, it is actually a must. There is a great sense of history , and the outlook bact to Santa Monica from the water is a great way to see LA.",wil r
50,"Iconic Pier, lives up to its movie star status","Iconic Pier, lives up to its movie star status, a must see, obviously touristy, but a great place to soak up the beach vibe",Adrianwd
40,Good if you have kids,"We stopped by the Santa Monica piers as it is on the LA to visit list. It has the same feel of Coney Island in New York.However, it is very touristy. I would say plan for an hour unless you have kids.",PeiT231
50,A good time,"Great place to hang out and people watch, lots of touresty stuff here...but this is the Santa Monica pier...get over yourself and have some fun.",Martin M
50,Great place to spend several hours or even the day,"Stopped by the Santa Monica Pier during a stay in Los Angelas. Interesting sites and many places to eat. If you can time your visit to see the sunset, you will appreciate it.",johndwilliams
50,Best just before sunset,Easy street parking along the main road (2$ per hour) go just before sunset and watch the sun go down behind the ferris wheel (from the beach side) then enjoy the view at night. Dinner options and snacks available too.,No0osho
40,Great Atmosphere,"The Pier was not what I had imagined but still fun, relaxed and a gorgeous setting. Take your time to pop into stores, view the sights, eat, play and enjoy",Paula R
30,End Of Route 66!,"Santa Monica Pier is the CA end of Route 66 which is SUPER COOL but other than that, it is extremely crowded and touristy. As long as you know that going in, you will have fun!",misopiso88
30,Another one of California one visit is enough attractions,Just not overly impressed. Lots of vendors selling typical tourist junk. A few overpriced under delivered eateries bathrooms with massive lines and were dirty and poorly kept. It was a hour visit including a meal and that was about it. The most attractive part of it was it was very pretty from down the beach at night.,Speedracer61
50,Great place to relax,Always look forward to visit the beaches of Los Angeles even in the winter. Lots of things to see and do and places to wat are great.,evangeli f
30,Day trip to Santa Monica,Had a good stroll along the pier. Had some funnel cake from one of the stalls. Short walk to the pier from the metro station. Didn't do any of the rides on the pier.,Jayesh
50,The Santa Monica pier is exciting and fun for all.,We had a business meeting and had a break. We drove to the pier. It was worth the drive. The food was great and there were a lot of vendors. The view was beautiful. We had a great time. Also they had something to do for the young and the young at heart.,donna y
50,Great day out,"Very good and well kept area.Saw a Sea Lion of the end of the Pier, although there were local fishermen trying to sell food to tourists which was off putting to see.Everything is typically overpriced - only complaint.",Adventures of a Welshman
50,Son's wedding,"Plenty of things to do the kids loved, great selections of food, and the Ferris wheel was so cool being on the water.",Gayle O
40,Fun stop,"Was in LA on a work trip decided to check out the Santa Monica icon. It was a fun stop, parking and getting there was typical LA fashion, lots of cones and redirects to get to the parking lot. 7 bucks for parking was a bit steep. But the pier itself is pretty much what you expect, lots of street performers and “interesting” people watching. I went early so the amusement park wasn’t overly crowded but steadily picked up through out the night. The park was really nothing more that a carnival on a pier and prices were comparable. You simply can’t visit Santa Monica with out riding the pier mounted feris wheel. There was a really obnoxious and pushy seal begging the fisherman for bait at the end of the pier. All in all, I hope make the trip back out and experience it with the family one day.",Jonathan M
40,Sunset,"One of the best sunset in the entire world. I’ve loved visiting the pier late in the evening, enjoing the Sun going into the ocean.",Sofia G
40,"Very crowded, hard to park, but cool and wait times for rides are good.",Very crowded but wait times for rides are relatively short. Can be cold at night especially if windy.,lcb22
40,Long time staple on the beautiful Pacific Coast,"This long time staple of the west coast is a very cool place to visit or those visiting from out of town or for locals who want to spend a quick fun afternoon by the water.The attractions have increased in price over the years but they still offer enough fun for the family and dates to keep in entertaining. The ferris wheel has to be given a go, and if you are lucky, you will catch one of the magnificent sunsets the west coast has to offer.There are your typical food shacks and snacks and some more casual dining restaurants like Bubba Gumps.Parking is a bit tough on busy weekends, so take an Uber or bike here.",Sobhanmoshrefi
40,"Lights, Music and Happy","Like any other pier this place is also filled with lights and laughter. We spend the evening on the beach and then went to the pier around sunset. The food shops and the fun rides and the beautiful beach at the backdrop make the pier magical. There’s people from all places playing, eating, dancing, chatting away. It’s a beautiful place with beautiful people. Perfect for an evening with family and friends.",sdahake
40,So cool to just ppl watch,"I loved the energy of this place, the ppl the sounds the entertainers everywhere. It was so much fun and we were travelling with a 2 yr old and this was such a neat place to sped u9r Sunday.",CrystalNLuc
40,Instaworthy Picture!,"If you want the iconic instaworthy picture with this pier on the background, my recommendation is to take the picture during Sunrise when there is no one around and the beautiful color pastel color of the sky.Sunset is beautiful but there are too many people to get a good shot and the sun just way too harsh if you don't equipt the right camera.We took these picture from the Original Muscle Beach overlooking the pier.",TravelMintsCo
30,Nice,The weather was bad but the place should be a great spot for surfers during the sunny days.Kind of old school relaxed atmosphere.,AnnekevdGulik
40,Superb... We went 3 times!!!,"Superb! Even in December - When the wind was not blowing we could walk around in T shirts! Take a look into the stores, buy an ice cream... Take a look at the fun fair - ride some rides... Watch the street entertainers... Look out to sea... Just chill, watch the World Go by!Loved it - Really cool go take a look - Go visit a restaurant!And chill :-)",Peter M
40,Pier-ly good,"Santa Monica pier lives up to all you see and hear about in the movies / docs/ pics etc. It is a must see if staying in this part of LA. Fortunately we had a great sunny day we visited. (December). Roomy wooden jetty to stroll with plenty of stalls, buskers, artists, artisans. magicians, musicians, famous people lookalikes - you name it. Great little fun park. Did ride ferris wheel , great views of Malibu & Venice beach. Plenty of food options, mostly american type fast food but no KFC or Macka's 👏👏 . Even tryed the local popular desert - funnel cake ( over sized donut really with heaps of strawberry topping and ice cream def. made to share.Internal Old style merry go round - piece of history. Also had a Bubba- Gumps shrimp restaurant - which we did eat at on our fianl night in LA. Had couple mojitos at end pier restaurant watching sunset. Enjoyed it immensely, a must see.",mccdzyne
50,Visit after dark,"Amazing food, Busker’s, amusement park and gorgeous views. Make sure you go and visit. Day or night it’s a fun place to be!",Sweetaromahbc2019
50,Bustling and Vibrant,"Whats a visit to LA without visiting Santa Monica Pier?Just like in the movies, its busy, with people selling stuff and live acts its got an amazing vibe to it. We went on a Weekend there and it gets full, keep kids close so they don’t get lost.It was an amazing vibe of various cultures. Different smells hit you as you walk along the pier towards the park as people are selling fresh fruit, churros, hot dogs and more.Its got the beach vibe while you hear people on the rides scream on the rides, laughter of children, nothing better to spend the day just chilling and taking it all in.",Naushina M
40,Family fun at the pier,"I enjoyed Santa Monica Pier with my teenage children when visiting from Australia in January 2019. The pier was exactly as it seems in the movies. The amusement park is nothing special, but we actually had a lot of fun on the rides and playing the arcade games. We were there for hours. January is probably a good time to visit, as it wasn’t very busy. The views from the ferris wheel are awesome. It had a nice fun vibe.",NP3003
30,Better viewed from afar,"We visited Santa Monica during the busy Christmas - New Year week, and it wasn’t enjoyable being out and about in the crowds. The Pier is one of those places that’s great to see once, but I don’t think we’ll be going back. The rides were quite expensive to go on, but provided a lovely view out of our hotel window. The Pier has all the usual tacky tourist shops, and dodgy looking food carts. I’m sure you’ll be like we were, and went despite reading all the mediocre reviews.",Sharyn W
50,Mom's First time,I was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser and had my mom with me. On our way home I took her to Santa Monica Pier since she had never been there. She had an amazing time just walking through the stores walking on the pier and walking in the sand. So glad I took her,Joyce P
40,Good fun for the family,"We came here during the winter from Canada. There are a few carnival rides on the pier and a dine in restaurant on the end of the pier. We stayed for about 4 hours. We did some rides, ate at the restaurant and finished the day with more rides and a final ice cream snack before leaving. The weather was dry and warm which was perfect. The rides are less exciting as the big theme parks in the area but the point for us was to enjoy the scenery and visit somewhere new. there were lots of people but the ride waits were only 15 minutes or so at the longest but only 7-10 minutes normal. My favorite part was the rollercoaster with my daughter, we got a great picture from the automated camera located on the ride. My least favorite part was paying $15 USD to get access to the file online to download it. For $15USD you'd think they would at least email it to you. There were a couple street performers performing tricks on the pier, and some nick-nack booths. Worth stopping in for awhile if you've never been before. We caught an Uber ride here so no info on the parking situation.",Dave M
30,This was mobbed with people.,We drove up from Venice beach to see Santa Monica and walk on the Pier and it was just okay. It was wonderful to see people from all over the world walking by and it was wonderful to see the sunset but not much to do (if you aren't interested in the amusement park).,travelbugs222
50,Great Beach spot,"There’s three things you need to know about the pier.1. Parking is not free but there’s different options. You have meter parking and various lots that you can choose from. The lots vary in price, but it’s never anything too crazy.2. The beach and pier entrance is free. The arcade and rides are not but you don’t have to pay for that if you don’t want to. You can just walk around and enjoy the view.3. The food on the pier is very limited and a bit pricey. You’re better off eating at the third street promenade (it’s a 5 minute walk from the pier). There’s a lot more options in different price ranges there.If you’re a local, it’s a good spot to visit every now and then. If you’re a tourist, you have to go and ride the Ferris wheel! 🎡",Nancy E
50,Great place to watch sunset,"A wonderful place to go in the late afternoon and early evening, watching sunset, wandering on the beach, riding in the Pacific Park, watching street performances and snacking. What a life!",flora z
50,Must do!,"Crowded, fascinating, interesting. Take a stroll along the pier, people watch, enjoy the views, take photos...",itsBG
30,Nice Pier but Overcrowded,The Pier is nice - but when we visited it was so busy you literally could hardly walk to the end. Also the musicians were loud and not that great. Maybe it was just an off day - I know it is a famous place.,MarchelleC
30,Fun trip to do once,"Word of note we paid too much for parking as we were confused and traffic was challenging. There is inexpensive parking down by the water front it’s just a challenge with lots of foot traffic on the streets and unfamiliarity to see the signs.Don’t pay the high prices and don’t pull into a parking place where someone is holding a sign flagging you in without a price being displayed. It’s going to be expensive... learn from us.Have patience and look for on the beach parking. Naturally, we saw this option after we paid $25 to park and started walking along the pier.It’s worth a one time visit to the pier as you get the beauty of the waterfront as well as the amusement park and the odd entertainment. Some artist like the violinist was incredibly talented but some were really oddballs! Fun day for sure.",2flyby
40,Such a cute place,Loved Santa Monica! Not overally much to do there for couples but it’s a nice stroll and beautiful views. Love the small shops and quirky people along the way ! Loved the pizza shop had a good pepperoni 👌🏼,pr0udmum
40,Fun evening,"My family and I had a great visit. We only rode one ride on the pier due to the amount of time we were able to stay, but riding the iconic coaster on the pier was so much fun. It's something our kids won't soon forget. The little shops along the way were nice to visit and priced fairly decent. We enjoyed the street performances along the way. I could rate higher if the rides weren't so expensive. The pier was also very clean.",luvmykids2
40,Tourist Attraction,"The end of Route 66. A very touristy place with quite a few eating outlets. There are also rides, an arcade. Of course there are plenty of souvenir stores.",lazytravel
50,A favorite spot for a Ferris wheel ride,This Ferris wheel ride is a nice and relaxing break with amazing views. The ride is not rushed and you get a good amount of time on the wheel.,BlueSki3s
50,Fun,"Surrounded by beach the beauty of the pier is stunning. Great restaurants, 100 year old merry-go-round, fun rides, and room to run for the kids.",kathyhK9551WZ
40,Great Photo Op,Beautiful views and a lot of options for some nice photos. We took the Metro and were very glad we did due to the traffic. The Pier is a very easy walk form the Metro Station.I enjoyed some of the performers. Some I'm not sure they make any money due to talent level! We were there for lunch and it was not easy to get a table much after 11:30. We did get an outdoor table with a view of the ocean and it was fantastic.,buktrvlr
40,Stunning,"What a beautiful place to visit. Even in the heart of winter, the warm sun makes for a perfect morning. Lovely novelty stores and views that go on forever.

50,End of Route 66!,"This is a must see to check off your list! We visited during the June gloom, but we had fun people watching! There is a parking lot next to the pier. There were several restaurants and food choices on the pier as well as merchandise. You must have your picture made at the Route 66 sign, but there will likely be a line of people doing the same thing!",Carolinesc7
40,Great Views,"We had to visit twice !!!On our fist visit it was a bit overcast and the sun was setting.. but the sunset was not a bit lackluster.On our second visit later that week, we spent the day, playing games in the arcade, riding the rides in the park and watching the second best sunset we have seen (Rick;s Cafe Negril Jamaica is the best) ... the view from the Pier to sea and back to shore is simply fantastic.There activities for all ages and all mobility levels, a simply fun place for a day trip.",CamiddleJm
50,Iconic place with iconic views!,"We had an awesome day there, and the highlight was renting bicycles and cycling to Venice Beach. Even for me, the ride wasn't too far, and the views were beautiful. We rode our bikes back to the Santa Monica Pier just as the sun was setting. Gorgeous!",Lisa C
30,Crowded Tourist Destination,"A quick walk up and down the pier is enough if you want the experience. It was very crowded, of course, but the many vendors selling junk at high prices clogged up the pier even more making it difficult to get through. We got a small cone that cost $7 which is typical of such touristy places. We did, however, enjoy the beautiful sunset.",KimGregOhio
50,a MOST visit place if you are in the LA area,"This place is beautiful, you should really visit it if you are in the LA or California area, specially at night the lights are amazing and there are lot of options for food and attractions, you most go",Reviews506
20,Uninteresting tourist trap - 5 minutes is plenty,"This was a disappointment! Very touristy unattractive pier selling cheap items you would expect from such a location. If you want to enjoy the crashing waves on the lovely nearby beach, avoid the constant out of tune noise from a 'music vendor' on the pier. I am sure that local attractions such as the aquarium are far more enjoyable. Worth a five minute visit to say you have been perhaps.",DRS69
