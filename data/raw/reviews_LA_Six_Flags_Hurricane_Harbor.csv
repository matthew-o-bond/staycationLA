30,Good selection of slides but expensive at every point,Lots of fun but at a high price! Good selection of slides for all ages and wasn’t too busy when we went luckily but having to pay extra on top of the already high entry fee for a ring for the lazy river was a bit of a disappointment ($7-$15 each!). Food and drink also expensive as with a lot of these places though. Could do with a lick of paint in areas also.,Claire M
50,Best time,A perfect way to cool down. So muc fun. So many good people. Te experience was great. Food was a little expensive but overall a 5 out of 5,Silvano
40,Just stopped in for a few hours,Just stopped in for a few hours to enjoy the cool water and get wet before the season was over!!Love the kiddie areas and didn’t actually ride any rides! The lazy river was sort of clear so we actually walked it a few times!!,Carolyn A McC
50,Fun for the whole family,"Great water park with a whole lot of slides ranging from short and slow for the little kids up to super scary for risk takers. The best part about this water park is that they have several different slides at each level; So if you want ""not scary at all"" you'll have a bunch of slides to try out, if you want ""slightly scary"" you'll have a bunch of slides, if you want ""somewhat scary"" you'll have a bunch, and if you want ""very scary"" you'll have a bunch. There are also other water activities like the river tour, wave pool, and waterfalls in Splash Island. They also have a lot of lounge chairs spread out all over the park for you to relax and rest on. This is an all day activity that's great for the whole family, and for single adults too.",Goldie C.
50,Fun water day,We had a great time at Hurricane Harbor. It was clean and staff was friendly. We stay the whole day from the time it open until the time it close. It was fun and relaxing. Yes we will go again. We rented a Cabana love it. The price for food and drinks were ok price but it is a theme park. But I did have a issue with the park that we could not bring in food or drink from out side. SO do not bring it because it is not allowed. They will make you throw it away or take it back to the parking lot. The other thing that I had an issue with is that their were boy older the 5 and younger the 18 in the girls restroom. This should not be allowed when young girls are changing.,Jennifer R
50,A pretty good way to end the summer.,The boys had fun getting wet. They can be on that lazy river all day. We are getting a season pass next year.,Martha C
10,ATTENTION Folks! DON't be FOOLED,"We were Very disappointed today 08/12/2019 and here's the story: by the end of 2018,we received from you your email highlighting different options to renew the season pass and we choose the Gold pass.it cleary says that you can bring a friend any day any time during 2019. My sister was planning to visit us here all the way from France and my husband and i thought it would be nice to offer her 2 visits to the park during her holidays. Yaay how exciting! Today at the entrance to the water park we were told that this offer only works with six flags and not the water park!!!!!! How come? Now you are saying that you are 2 different parks !!!!! How come you are 2 different parks if access to both parks is ok with the same card!!!! Plus the gold pass clearly mentions bring your friend any day any time for free. How are we supposed to know that this is only ok for sixflags and not for the water park especially that access to both parks is made with the same card... you are simply trying to fool people. We really regret being members for 3 years in a row . This is such a shame . Thank you for ruining a day i was waiting for months 😑😑😑😑",Maroua
50,Hurricane Harbor,We went on a Friday. It was the first time for 3 of us. There were not many lines. The experience was great.,Julissa B
40,"For me, a great substitute for the beach","This is my favorite place to be in the summer; and with a pass, this has become my substitute beach. The wave pool is so fun and the lazy river is perfect for cooling down after sitting in the sun. The only complaints I have are there aren't enough canopied areas and not enough variety in food.",ahryunbunch
40,Great but could be amazing!,Has the potential to be one of the best water parks in the world with its great rides and fun areas. However the management of it needs improvement to have a better experience for visitors. Queue times and food prices are not great although the rides/slides are very good. The lockers are $15 for the day and it did fit a medium to large backpack in. The rip off part is you can rent a dinghy for the day instead of queuing at the rides and the pizza is $33 for a big one but it’s not worth that.The orange and blue capsule slides are the best but the group ones are also very good. Definitely enjoyed it here but it could have been better.,Duerds5
10,Mrs,Water was dirty too crowded and not that many options foods are expensive and very unhealthy I don’t think I will ever go back!,Ellie
30,"Just OK, but there are better water parks...","We arrived early as advised... there was still a big queue at the entrance but hey ho!The park felt a little bit run down to us and there were a couple of slides that were not working... we bought the Platinum Fast Pass, well worth it if you are to only visit one time (we are from the UK)... but they are $60 each! Also there seemed to be no direct theme to the park; it was just a lot of slides and restaurants thrown together tbh. As well as all this when we went on the blue drop slides (as the orange one wasn’t working) we all came off with red marks down our backs and it wasn't a pleasant ride.The attractions were OK, food queues were huge and the prices were high... beer prices were extortionate, $11 for a bottle of beer... hump!We are a well travelled family, theme park crazy and this park unfortunate sits right down at the bottom of our list.We are off to Soak City in a few days and hope that it will be a good as the sister theme park... Knott's Berry Farm (really recommended)... Raging Waters is also a LA water park... check those out before going to Hurricane Harbour... but that’s just our opinion.",Martin
50,Hurricane Harbor Awesome Water Park !,"If you get season passes, it is so worth it. My Grandkids love the water and Hurricane Harbor has lots of different water slides, lazy river, wave pool and more. Something for all ages. Bring sunscreen, towels and don't bring much more in case you have to leave your stuff on the lounge chairs while you are in the water. With the passes you get a lot of discounts.On the down side you can't bring food in and the food is pricey.",vacationcindy2222
10,In need of a bathroom remodel!!!!,They need to update the showers in the bathrooms. Nobody likes to wipe with toilet paper when their bottom is wet. They need showers with curtains and the detachable handles if they want a clean water park.,LadyG
50,Always fun..,We love the water and what better place to be on a hot day.. Hurricane Harbor :) You can relax in the lazy river or jump on some exciting ride.. lots of choices,Shannon
40,Nothing like this place on a hot day,Bring your sunscreen and leave your valuables behind and then just be 12 years old for several hours in a row,nielsh928
50,Get The Annual Pass for your kids!,"In the summer months when our kids were teens, we would spend many days enjoying the variety of pools (esp the wave pool) and crazy tall water slides!!!This mom would find a reclining lounge chair with piped in music at a lovely pool, and our kids would go off and enjoy the variety of water slides. They were teens, and would go in pairs so there was never an issue of safety, just wonderful summer time fun!",Tari K
40,"Great Water Park, Long Lines, Overpriced Food","I go to Hurricane Harbor at least 4 or 5 times every summer. Each time I go there I think and feel the same thing. This is fun, but the lines are much too long and the food is poor and overpriced. You CAN pay close to $100 to skip the lines, but that's ridiculous. If you go, just be prepared. Lines WILL be long. Food will be POOR and OvERPRICED. But, the rides you do ride will be fun, but they will be few in number because of how long you'll have to wait.",Fred G
40,Great water park for the area!,"Despite having the San Fernando Valley nearby, this water park is the only one in the area. Lots of fun and extreme water slides, with plenty of lockers on site. Nearby Magic Mountain makes this Six Flags property a ""destination location"", with enough fun between the two parks for an entire weekend. Summer months are extremely hot, so bring plenty of sunblock & money for H2O.",Jerry Crawford
40,Fun for the entire family,Our children are young (7 and 4) and they love coming here in the summer. Weekends are very crowded so there’s a chance you won’t find a place to sit/rest your stuff. We tend to go during the weekdays after 2 pm to avoid the crowds. It’s a water park so of course it’s not very clean through out the park. There is plenty to do for young kids as well as for teenagers. The lazy river and the wave pool is our family’s favorite pass time. Lines for lunch/snacks are always long! But there’s not much you can do about that. The staff is on the YOUNG side so sometimes they don’t know what they are doing but they are all very nice. We have a season pass which makes it worth it for our entire family.,Jazmin S
40,Great slides!!,I enjoyed the various slides at the water park. I wished they heat the water though. Here in Orlando all of our water parks heat the water temps to around 85 F. It was a GREAT way to relax for the afternoon before it started to cool down (air temp wise).,Dean A
50,Solid Waterpark,"Six Flags has made some nice upgrades to their season passes. Hurricane Harbor now has a reserve area for guests that pay for a Diamond Season Membership. You have to reserve it online before your visit, but it’s free if you have the Diamond Membership. It’s a reserved area in the park that offers nice shade overlooking the wave harbor.They also offer slightly early entrance into the park if you have an upgraded season membership pass. It’s nice to get in a little early to get your rafts rented and get a few slides completed before the masses start flooding in.This park has a lot of waterslides that will appeal to kids of all ages and sizes. I can spend a solid day in the park and be entertained most of the time. They have a nice lazy river to float in. There is a great wave pool. They have super high slides with steep and long drops. If you want a more tame slide, they have those too.",BienViaje68
50,Great Water Park! Arrive Early!,"Love this water park. We always arrive as it opens to get seating and onto as many slides as possible prior to the hoards arriving. Food is pretty good, but lines can be time consuming. Small store for souvenirs or anything you need. Had to buy a bathing suit their once that didn't have metal rivets! NO METAL ON YOUR SUIT!!! Can rent your own raft, minimizes waiting for one and can use it in the lazy river.",KimbaDDS
40,Get Ready and Get Wet!,"Hurricane (no relation to Florence) Harbor is about 30 different ways to get Wet! First, Be absolutely sure to bring and Wear some good fitting water shoes. These and Sun block are mandatory items! There are rides and things to do for every age group. Just don’t try and be a hero at age 45 and up! Some of the rides are frightening. But then there is a wading-float ride that circles the main beach area. There you can test your adult abilities on a man made wave.Be aware of following...This is a public water park with lots of under 11 yo kids in the water that will drink everything and forgo going to the bathroom because they’re having fun! Coming down with an infection like a cold may happen. So buyer beware if you have a major health concern. Just use common sense and avoid large crowded areas. It is worth the visit and bring a Coke Can. There is usually a discount printed on it.",Steve
40,Had a blast,At the water park we had a great time. The reason I gave it a 4 though is the broken down rides. The amazing long lines even at the food places cause they are in slow season mode even though it was a holiday weekend,CarolKozak08
50,Loads of fun,I loved that they catered for our family. They have lots of fun and scary rides and then there is the wave pool and lagoon if you want to relax. Lines were not long at all when we went at end of August but check the crowd calendar anyway.,erica6634
50,SBM805,My family attended Hurricane Harbor in Aug/2018 it was one of best experience at a water park this summer and we went to a couple in Los Angeles area and Hurricane Harbor was the best my daughter is disabled people were AWESOME!!,sbm805
30,Decent rides but most of them are closed,"1) it's an amusement park. expect lines. though they weren't horrible when we went on a friday in august. so i suggest folks get over the lines. i mean, build your own water park for yourself. or if you don't want to spend that much money, pony up for a fast pass. when we were there almost nobody had the fast passes. those who did benefited.2) however, six flags suffers from self inflicted problems. when we were there they closed the lazy river - which looks pretty awesome - because they don't have enough lifeguards. i get it, it's litigious new jersey. they were sued a few years ago because somebody drowned in 3 feet of water. life's not fair. up your wages and hire more people. your product suffers when you close a cool attraction because you can't hire enough people to man it during the ridiculous absurd legal environment that exists in nj.3) food was decent for an amusement park. i've had worse at cedar point, for example.4) my wife is a diamond member for 20 bucks. it seemed worth the price with all the discounts and up front parking and access to the seating areas.5) one other problem- it's pretty poorly managed. one of the lifeguards explained the reason for a long line was because the other life guard managing the top of the water slide was delaying people too long in between rides. she said there was no reason there was so much time in between rides, besides somebody either being too cautious or not paying attention.",chrispuravida
40,Lines!,The Food lines are ALWAYS CRAZY!!!! They have a few windows for pizza only and the rest is at other lines. They should say Pizza and Salad so you can go anywhere for Salad. They have 2 windows for drinks only but usually only one window is open!,pjeffyp
10,"Boring rides, long lines, poor value for money","We visited on a quiet week day in July. Long lines for rides that were not really exciting. Ridiculously inadequate number of food outlets, my daughter passed out as we were unable to access food and had to queue for over half an hour in the full sun. Unable to take own food into park. Overall this place puts their profits over your safety, young inexperienced staff..it’s just an accident waiting to happen. Unless you want to pay to wait in line for the whole day, go somewhere else!",Sue K
50,Worth it!,"Friendly staff and awesome rides! We didn't eat here though, we ate across the street to save a few bucks. Can't wait to come back and do it all again!",Kati S
20,Rip off at every stage,"Minimum $25 to park, $15 for a locker, no food or drink to be taken in, then there are not enough staff to run the slides properly, which causes long delays. It was a very quiet Tuesday that we visited, I would've hated to go on a busy day. The slides are good, but it is let down by greed and poor running. I would not return.",pk10101
20,Needs to be repaired,Slides are leaking water all over the place. Dont feel safe here. Almost saw a young boy die droping down sideways from one of the floor dropping water slides. Had two pools closed from poop in the water. Lazy river was so dirty couldn't see my legs. The changing area only has freezing cold water in the one giant shower and now privacy to change. Do not waste your time or money here. Food was disappointing as well. No vegetarian options at all.,J6063CWjamess
10,Not worth the money,"I visited Hurricane Harbour with my boyfriend. We have only been to one other waterpark before. We had so much fun at that park so we were very excited. However, at the end of our visit we were very disappointed.We had prepaid tickets and parking.We had decided to arrive before or at opening time to avoid traffic. Unfortunately we got delayed so we arrived at the park around 1 hour late. The traffic was horrible!! We spent over an hour waiting in line for parking! That’s unacceptable.We found the park to be extremely dirty. Walking paths, restroom and eating facilities were filthy before noon.We waited 45 minutes for our first ride so we decided to get fast passes (regular) to avoid waiting in line. That was totally worth it and if I were to visit again I would purchase the pass with reduced waiting time. There were WAY too many guests at the park. Our visit was basically just waiting and waiting. It was a Saturday in August so peak season I know, but they must restrict the number of guests allowed in the park at the same time. The lines for food/snacks/lockers/rides/restrooms were ridiculous.I will definitely not be visiting Hurricane Harbour again, not even if it were free.",Anna S
10,RIP OFF,"This place is a total rip off.you aren't aloud to take food in and they search your bags and make you throw away food. you think you being check for safety but its purely so you can't take any food in. I was told I had to throw away two packets of cookies even though I told them I was diabetic and needed a few snacks. the food is so expensive and poor over $5.00 for a coke.The first hour was okay to get on rides but after that queued for hours for one slide. the main wave pool was over crowed with people using their own rental blue floats another expense they can be used to fast track some rides, but when people have gone home there are just left around the pool and other areas.water wasn't that clean and park and toilets were dirty. badly run, staff don't watch when slide or pool area is clear so are left waiting till you can slide which makes the queue times longer. some areas smelly of urine too.DONT WASTE YOU MONEY. STAY AT HOTEL IN A CLEAN POOL.",Justine I
20,No Fun!,"Went to cool off in the hot 100+ heat and was met with long lines, dirty lazy river, and no shade what so ever. Why aren't there canopies throughout the park? not everyone wants to bake in the sun. One person in our party had heat stroke. The children couldn't bear to stand in lines so just went into the wave pool. Would have been better staying home.",Susana B
20,Fun but Dirty,"First the bad, because it is important to know this. Hurricane Harbour is very dirty and unhygienic. We arrived very early and there was litter everywhere. The lawn chairs are absolutely filthy. It is blatantly apparent that the owners and management do not care about the cleanliness or upkeep of the park and only about how much money they can take it. And it is expensive here. Six Flags seriously needs to take a leaf out of the Disney book on how to manage a good theme park, because they sure could learn something about, cleanliness and customer service for starters!Then the good. It’s a fun place for kids and my 6 year old Son had a blast. He especially loved the wave poo",BilboKMB
10,Don't do it!,"Crowded, dirty, hot hot hot, rude life guards, long line ups and very expensive. I was there for an hour and did not touch water due to ""staffing issues"". Many areas were closed. I actually had to walk over a blood stain and bloody tissue on the stairs. The only reason I am giving it at least one star is because the supervisor and front end staff were professional and kind.",2019ABE
10,Don’t waste your money !,"If you like waiting in line in 100+ heat while children are vomiting and having heat strokes , unhappy and rude employees , no medics to be found , dirty water with trash and feces in it then go right a head .If you are a germ freak this is not the place for you! This place needs a regular raking and trash pick up because it is in the water and it is gross.Parking -25 bucks -ridiculous .",Lisa G
10,Be prepared to walk and wait,"The water slides at this park are good, but the walk from the large parking area and the waiting in lines are not worth the money spent to visit. I was very disappointed.",cwalter2014
10,"Horrible, don’t waste your time and money","I’ve been to water parks all around the world. This is by FAR the worst EVER! Horrible customer service (other than life guards). 1.5 HOURS to get food as you can’t bring it in and there are only a few options. Long lines to park, security and enter (thankfully we had tickets in advance as it took over an hour to get into the park). Long lines at all rides (over an hour). Rides are old and paint/plastic faded on most. Water is dirty/murky. While the staff is good about picking up trash on walkways there is lots of litter in the bushes/sides of walkways and the place is just dirty. Cost of everything is higher than most parks I’ve been too. Don’t do it. In SOCAL I’d recommend aquatica not the best but prices, lines, etc are good.",Jeremy E
50,Great place to cool off,We enjoy Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. There is a kiddie area and slides for the more adventurous people too,Meredith J
10,"Disgusting, Dirty, Slow Service","Oh Hurricane Harbor how you ALWAYS FAIL and Disappoint. Seriously. Two off the big pools closed at open of the day. No one has a clue if they will reopen. Lame. Especially as these are the pools in front of the Cabana Cove. Lines for food ridiculous because of incompetent employees. Shouldn’t take an hour to get a basket of chicken. Special member dining line even worse. One person to take money, pour drinks and deliver food. Nachos delivered missing items. Other food places closed at 11:45. Lunchtime!? Must rent a $7 tube for the lazy river. Really? What happened to the free tubes that were a different color? $15 for a small locker. Oh and the ONLY ATM in the park out of service at 10:40 am. Can the fun money wristband be used at both park? Employees don’t know. Will the pools reopen? Employees don’t know. I wonder what they do know. Photo below of some of the closed attractions.",Breely22
50,Waterpark,The water park was great with the family and kids. The water is definitely a little chilly and I think 85 degrees was the coolest temperature I'd recommend going. Not quite as many rides available as I expected but the ones that were there were great. Not to crowded and small wait lines but we went just before California kids were out of school for the summer. Food was reasonable inside the park. Lockers are great and reasonable. Tubes are $7 to rent which helps get you through some of the lines better on single tube rides.,Jason D
20,Sloooooow,"Well. The lines weren’t too bad actually, despite being mid June. But the lines moved sooo slooowly. And at every ride there was some kind of shutdown in service which made everything take forever. Made 3 rides in one day. Most time was spent waiting for rides with a complete standstill due to some kind of disturbance.",Fredrik J
20,"Great potential, facility, and infrastructure","The park has all of the potential to be great, but it could use new management. It should also be very clear that the water is not heated. The wave pool was really cold and thr lazy river freezing. Everyone is standing in it walking around. At most theme parks you are charged a ton for everything but the ""magic"" makes it worth it. Here they overcharge on everything, to a ridiculous degree (disney would be jealous) and way under deliver. They were super understaffed. Many of the slides were closed because they didn't have enough people to run them. The concessions were super slow and again think disney prices plus 25 to 50 percent. To be fair my 10 year old daughter still loves it, but the adults were mostly miserable. I grew up loving 6 flags but I will not come back here again.",Jared B
40,Great for the whole family,We enjoyed a full day here. Highly recommend a cabana and flash pass. There is something for everyone.,BJ05
10,Give Hurricane Harbor some love too,"Six Flags is a fantastic park that is well maintained. Parts of Hurricane Harbor look abandoned. The whole park needs a face lift. Paint itself would make a huge difference. My family visits water parks often and WOW what a let down. The area for diamond elite members was almost empty but because we didn’t reserve the night before. There was literally no place to sit down and get shade. Please,please pay as much attention to the water park as you do the theme park.",whitneystridermds
10,Lines,They really need to control the lines it seems like there is no control when you go into the main entrance or the park entrance everyone is cutting you spend along time in the last be to have someone go in front of the others. Ever time I go this happens,JoAMo
50,Amazing water park!,"We spent the entire day at this water park, and it’s incredible!So many amazing slides, including some that are only available at this park!The lazy river is huge, and great for chilling out in after a long day.A lot of the rides allow you to ride as a pair, which is even more fun!Only criticism would be there isn’t enough places on site to get food, resulting in huge queues at the places you can!",Michael Steven G
40,Fun and crowded!,"This is probably my favorite water park. It is kind of a drive from San Diego but I feel like it's well worth it. We went during the Fourth of July weekend which was probably a mistake because it was packed. Still had a lot of fun. I recommend if you're going to be there all day to rent a cabana. There are I believe three different prices depending on which kind of Cabana you're going to rent for the day. I paid $125 for the day. Super worth it that way if you have little kids they can get out of the sun for a little bit, there isn't a whole lot of shade at this water park.The only disappointment I feel like is the food is waaaaaaaay overpriced I paid for two slices of pizza was over $15. I paid for three souvenir cups that had free refills for that day it was around $47. So if you're going to eat there it can add up really quick. You cannot bring any food or drinks in the park but I was talking to people there and they had brought their lunch in a cooler and just left it in their car. With that said depending on where you park that could be kind of a hike to get to your car but they do have buses that go back and forth from the parking lot.The park was clean from what I can see the only thing that was kind of gross was the bathrooms. I think because of the people being wet, the floors were wet around the toilet so you didn't know if you were literally standing in water or urine lol...We will totally be going back!!! kids had so much fun it was worth it. We will just make sure the next time we go is not on a holiday weekend.",Trish

10,TERRIBLE,We went to the water park to treat our kids on holiday. But a complete waste of money. We waited over an hour to feed them. The queues were long. It didnt look like it had been cleaned in a long time. I did complain to the head office who promised to respond in 7 days LATEST. After 35 days and 4 emails I got the standard reply. On the flip side the Six Flags theme park was enjoyable.,mat954

Disgusting. Words fail me!",4WilsonsUK
40,Fun/lots of people,"Yes it is a blast to go down the slides. The down side: u have to rent a locker for wallet, long long lines, very expensive to buy food and water and a line there too, hard time to find a space for towel to sit/lay down. Try going during the week, get there when they open and reserve a cabana if u can afford it!!",allana s
20,Very disappointing,"We arrived at this park as soon as it opened but some of the rides weren't open. There isn't much there, the food is expensive. It cost $25 to park & $20 for a locker.",jayne r
50,"Really, Really good waterpark","We went on a Saturday so the park was very busy. We did buy the fast pass though which got you on the rides quite quickly. I'd advise you get this if going in a busy period.Food & Drink is expensive so I'd buy this before you get there via their site.The rides themselves are great. I'd say Orlando Wet'n'\wild was better but still very good.Well worth visit if your in LA.You have to pay to park, so buy before hand.Easy to find and bring your own towels.

30,Felt a little dated,"Went for my daughters birthday. It was our first visit to this water park. Wasn't familiar with the setting but based on the other reviews and it being Summer which is always busy, we rented a Cabana. The Cabana's did seem very close together. After coming back after one ride the Cabana next to us had what looked like a hundred of bags piled up on the 3 sunbed's, over spilling onto ours. It would have been nice for the Cabana staff to have noticed this and removed it as it was right next to their hut ( to clarify the Cabana next to us was just being used for a day camp bag drop. After all the money we spent on the Cabana I didn't want to be feeling like I was on a conveyor belt at Lax. Surely there are other areas that these bags can be kept?) We received free tubes and waiter service but I'm not sure the experience of a Cabana at this particular water park is worth the money.The park itself was ok, it just seemed dated.The lazy river was great, my recommendation would be to get in before 12, after that its like sardines in a tin.",Fulfordx5

30,Not a lot of rides,I had high expectations going in and I was disappointed after the good things I've heard about American waterparks. It didn't have a lot of rides and you had to pay for rafts for the river cruise and a wave pool.,Alessandro Vazzaz
30,OK Time!,"Took my boys to the park and because the local kids went back to school we had virtually NO wait for rides midweek ! So we had a reasonably Good Time.Now for the Bad News and B.S.Glad we didn't have to BUY that ridiculously stupid FLASH PASS that cost a small fortune. The tickets are expensive enough then if the park is crowded that have a SCAM to go ahead of the line if you pay a Large FEE with 3 Different options ???? What a VERY STRANGE Marketing Idea!!!We travel from a distance away and need to stay at a hotel that cost money. If we need to buy a FLASH PASS along with $25.00 Parking (What the Heck) and then forced to purchase Terrible food a Dried out Hot Dog, Hamburger or 3 Crappy Chx Tenders for $10.99 -12.99 with stale fry's. Magic Mountain becomes a LOSS and disappointing vacation option!The Park is OLD and SOME rides are closed.Anyway overall NOT a G8 value! If you add up all the a family of 4 with all the fees, charges & 1 one lunch and a couple of drinks it can cost a small fortune per person for a day!And you have to wait for rides when crowded the Value is NOT worth going.Fortunately we bought a discount Multi Park pass and a discounted Food Plan last year so it was an OK value. I feel sorry for the family that travels there for the 1 day it is a Bad value!Hope you found this review helpful.Note Hurricane Harbor food is hit and miss we had to ask them on 3 occasions for Fresh fry's and Burgers.Good Luck with your visit!",China Bob
30,Long wait lines...Poor communications,"We pre-paid for parking only to arrive to find one line open to the parking lot so we still had to wait while a long line of cars paid to enter, so no advantage to pre-pay. There were more lanes open at the gate so entrance was a little quicker. Be aware if you only go to the water park, entering wearing a bathing suit is okay, but if you plan to enter the amusement park, you will have to change into street clothes. This is strictly enforced.The rides in the water park are nice, though many are closed. Most water slides have a height minimum of 48"" so young kids will only be able to go to the splash areas and lazy river. The splash areas are nice but very large with multiple entrance so it is very easy to loose sight of a little one. Very scary.Pricing seems reasonable at around $35 a person until you get hit with the endless add-ons. $25 to park, $7 per tube to rent. $18 for a locker. It quickly cost us $136 for 3 and we didn't eat or drink anything.Due to rough housing by kids on the stairs to the top of the towers on most of the slides, you have to wait at the bottom of the tower until each group has gone down. Communication to those waiting about any ride problems or delays is non-existent so you never know if the line is just moving slow or has totally stopped. Poor setup.Overall it is very frustrating and not the best of water parks.",Tennessee50plus
10,expensive boring cheating,If you book online in advance you pay more as the employee did not give prepaid drinks with prepaid meals. It was crowded and the lines were mega long. Afterward they don't respond to 6 mail requestBulgarian waterparks are far more better,Pernille
40,Pretty nice,"Its a very organized setup to come have fun in the sun.Ride lines aren't too bad and some pools are super cold as it is hot.The only issue I had was against the disorganization of food court team members for the free refills RED Cup. They were denying free refills because someone said they were closing, but a Manager came over and said to open up the lines. After 20+ people left to stay in another line.Make sure you bring a lot of sun screen and bottle water.",Shong B
50,Fun times with the KIDDOS!,"Absolutely loved the water park myself, super clean, friendly, things for everyone to do and the kids had so much fun. So many things for all ages to do. Had a blast . Wish it was closer I go more often.",Alicia J
40,So much Fun,Got the Six Flags Season Pass October 2016 and it was the best bang for the buck EVER!! The fact I can use it at all their parks PLUS Hurricane Harbor is great. My kids and their friends had a blast even though the lines are a little long and the food is pricey.,PLB1908
30,Really crowded and they charge for everything,"We got a cabana and that includes nothing but the cabana. The service at the cabana is slower than if you just wait on food lines and the menu is limited. They don't have popsicles at the cabana but they have them elsewhere in the park. The icee machine was broken, etc. you have to pay for a fast pass, you have to pay for a tube, etc. Was fairly unpleasant experience. Very hot, crowded, okay rides. Maybe I am just not a water park person but I doubt I would ever return.",travelingworkingmom
30,About that I expected.,"My family of 4 visited HH together with another family of 4 on a Saturday. It was my first time at a water park in about 30 years. My kids are 4 and 5 and we thought it was about time we paid a local water park a visit. When the idea of renting a cabana was brought up I thought it was great as this would help to maximize the experience since we were a large party with small kids. The idea of having to fight for lounge chairs and leave our stuff unattended just out in the open made me cringe too. Overall the cabana was a good idea split two ways for one of the middle end cabanas. It wasnt anything fancy. A big plastic tent/canopy with a zipper, a small table and 4 chairs. You have access to maybe 2-4 lounge chairs right in front of the cabana too.As to be expected for a weekend during the summer, it was packed. I only managed to get on one ride after about an hour wait, yeepee. The majority of the time was spent in the small pool near the entrance and then in the children's pool areas. We saw the wave pool for a second. The lazy river...ha. It was more like a lazy herd of people walking down a river of what I can only imagine filled with ugh. It was a pain to get into it, then a pain to get out of it. I suppose if you have a tire to float it it would be somewhat good (4 are included with the cabana rental).The bathrooms were disgusting! There is no other way to put it. For the fact that this place is packed on the weekends and the bathrooms/showers are a central/essential feature of a water park you would think they would have a good dedicated staff keeping it some degree of clean? Nope. I went to the bathroom 3 times. The first time a dad was just finishing changing his diarrhea soaked kid. He left the diaper out in all of its gorry glory while he went to spray his kid down. Later on a second run to the urinal the diaper had made its way to the garbage, but was still basically in a fully filled garbage bin stinking up the bathroom. On a 3rd visit the diaper was still in the garbage now with the addition of flies. I mean these visits were about an hour a part each time. The women's bathroom/showers didn't fair any better. My wife went there twice with our daughter and reported that it was filthy there too. They had urine all over the toilets seats and one of the toilets was overflowing on both of her visits. Obviously there is a disconnect with management/operations and just basic overview/cleanliness of the bathrooms. I guess the bottom line matters more than health and cleanliness. It certainly didn't appear to be a deterrent just based on how packed it was and they obviously know that. At this point I would have second thoughts about returning here before visiting the other local water parks within driving distance....Knott's, Raging Waters. They might not be any better, but I would want to go see for myself before returning here.Food -Food was ok, we tried the pizza, chicken fingers and fries. The usual. Not great, not bad.",PapiJohn
50,Fun for kids,Was very fun i had such a good time. the rides were insanely fun and amusing i really loved this place omg omg,Ransom b
50,Got kids? This works.....,"Okay, I'm not as comfortable in a bathing suit as I used to be, but this place is fun and if you have kid - or even if you don't - this is a cool place to chill out during the hot days of summer. Steep slides, interesting slides, it's all fun. The teens will love it. Nice kids zone for the younger ones, too. Bring the sunscreen...",James D
50,Hurricane Harbor,"This place is fun for the whole family! There is a kiddie area for young ones, family rides, and thrill rides. This is a place that those of all ages can enjoy.",Suzanne V
30,"Plenty of rides, but poorly equipped","Came here for a day with my son. The rides are good with as much variety as you can muster with a water park, however like the Magic Kingdom next door it's poorly organised. The Roaring Rapids for example doesn't have enough mats to race down on. From outside it looks like there's no queue as you see people climbing the stairs and going straight down. But that's because we're all waiting at the bottom for a mat. The day I was there, there were literally about 10 mats available! It's similar but slightly better with the rubber rings. Also it's the only water park I've been to where they charge you for a rubber ring for the lazy river!On the plus side the food is good (but typical park prices) and the staff were very friendly, and enthusiastic.",Xhara71
30,Too crowded on sundays,"A lot of activities and dining facilities are availables, but on the sunday we were there it was clearly not geared accommodating the amount of guests admitted. It was impossible to get sunbeds, queuing for everything caused extended time wasted. All pools and slides were almost inaccessible.",Per J
20,Lifeguards DON'T CARE,"I was injured riding 'Sidewinder'. When I hit the second turn, my tube hit a dry spot and threw me from my tube and slamming me into the slide. Unfortunately my head and shoulder broke my fall. I slid the entire way down on my butt and came out holding my head. The life guard at the bottom saw me come out holding my head, struggling to stand and tubeless.I have to say how deeply disappointed I am in how she handled the situation being a former Hurricane Harbor guard myself. She asked me where my tube was, I told her what happened and she asked if I was OK. I looked at her with tears in my eyes and said I don't know. I hit my head so hard and hurts pretty bad. She said ""You could go to first aid if you want."" and she walked back to the end of the flumes.The rider behind me came out and I asked her if she saw my tube. She said it was stuck to the wall and hit her in the face but stayed stuck. The next rider after her had my tube in her hand and said she saw the tube and was able to grab it.We didn't go to first-aid and immediately left the park. I went to urgent care and luckily I didn't have a concussion only a severe headache and a massive bump and bruising on my head. My shoulder suffered a contusion and swelling.Maybe it's already time to start conducting audits on your shallow guards. It was also noticed guards don't tell kids to walk. I can't even tell you how many times I saw kids fall right in front of a guard and the guard kept walking. One guard at the bottom of bamboo racer was allowing the guests to run down the flumes... a good handful had slipped. Thankfully no one had bumped their heads. A guest flipped out of their tube on lightning falls and the lifeguard just stood there and watched the child struggle to stay above water.What head guard/supervisors passed these guards on their tests during training? The amount of carelessness from the guards must be addressed. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING.",Mishelle B
40,Fun,Great for a really hot day. Take your sunscreen as it gets blazing hot out here. Go mid-week for lighter crowds. Lot's of kids everywhere. Some pretty fun stuff!,Steve A
40,Good Waterpark for the Family,We have season passes to six flags so it's always fun for us to go. We went last weekend with our Girl Scout Troop and were able to take advantage of the friends free program with our passes. The lazy river is always so dirty. June gloom made everything freezing but the kids didn't care. It was actually nicer because no one was there so the kids were able to ride the rides without any lines. Food is regular park food so not much there and it's expensive like any other place. If you have a dining pass it's a good deal. We brought in some small snacks and a few small water bottles without an issue. There are life jackets available if you go up to the counter where they rent the tubes. Tubes are somewhat expensive and you have to keep track of it. Get there early to get seats. Castaway Cove has picnic tables that you can sit at. Cabana Cove has a bunch of Cabanas to rent out.,Cynthia A
40,"Fun water park, and a nice break from magic mountain","Nice size water park, a lot of fun pools and slides. Things for all ages and tastes. Wave pool was stopped for most of the time we were there, so no comment on it.If you leave Magic Mountain to go to it and plan to come back there is a sheet you need to put your name on. The person at the exit did not mention it when asked about the return dye getting damaged by the water, but the attendant and the return gate was a little irritated when she had to check our passes because the UV dye was all distorted.",Wesley R
40,Great,"This park is great , like Magic Mountain. It has great rides for families and big ones as well . The food is good but not great, and you should buy a dining pass because like any other theme park, the food tends to be pricey. The lockers, the women's at least, aren't private at all and if you want something private, you would have to change in a bathroom stall, which isn't very convenient.",Samantha B
20,Grandkids to Six Flags,"Long lines, even if you rent a tube, you have to wait until tubes are available for folks that didn't rent tubes (alternate turns). Also, people steal your tube and cut line.Biggest disappointment, they made my granddaughter wear a life jacket because of her size. It was very uncomfortable and ruined her day. She was only 1/2 inch too short. BTW, She is a great swimmer.",maintainin
30,Too busy,"Pretty standard waterpark fodder, but far too busy. We lasted 4 hours with a 9 and 11 year old. The rides we did go on where good, just took far to long. Would not visit again, probably perfect for teenagers in my opinion.",aussierater2
50,Fun in the sun,"Great day to spend with the family enjoying thrill water rides or just relaxing by the wave pool. There are so many thrilling water rides and the lazy river, just sit in your tube a float away..kids have a great time with all the water slides and water falls. Food is the best I have had at a water park...fresh, grilled burgers OMG better that In N Out...sorry in n out. but they are!!!",lloponen08
30,Lot's of water fun,"Great place to go, attractions for everyone including little kids. A lot of activities a slides of all types for all level's of excitement and thrills. The food is pretty good not to expensive for park food. Suggest you get there early, if you have funds get a cabbanna",ALAN B
30,Perfect for a hot day,"Wear flip flops. The ground gets hot and gross. The bathrooms get super disgusting. Things are old.Wish the CEO of Six Flags would allot some funds to updating this park and putting in cleaner facilities.Overall, the park is fun for the kids. The lazy river can be GROSS. Doesn't seem like their filters work and the lifeguards aren't helping to maintain the cleanliness. Once when I visited,'I could feel hair and leaves wrapping around me legs. It was DISGUSTING.Giving this place an average rating because the kids like it and it's good to go when it's warm outside. Just be sure to go early to grab a seat.",Cynthia A
50,Water Fun,"Awesome water fun for people of all ages. The park provides various water activities for all ages, has plenty of seating to sun tan, lockers, food and of course plenty of water. Highly recommended, if you have never experienced the water park, make a plan to do so and when the park closes at 6 pm, you can shower get dressed and enjoy riding the roller coasters for the rest of the night. Here you can visit two parks in the same day which is a win win in my book",Erlinda M
30,Fun in the sun 9/24/2016,"Bad stuff first :Food was ok stay away from the burgers chicken is much better, Soft pretzels were hard. Lazy river was very very dirty of leaves like they have not cleaned it in months. There was one blue slide the kids had to scoot down. Also what happened to trams omg we had to walk there and we were so tired before we even started our day. When we left there was a bus but the line for one bus wasnt worth the wait so we walked again to our car.Upside: We rented a cabana gold which has service which i recommend if you have alot of kids, we placed a order of food and they brought it to us no food lines to wait in also same with drinks. There very fast and friendly was very happy and will rent one again.",CrystalNSteve

40,Nice way to cool off during the heat!,"The Water Park is not as excited as the Theme Amusement Park. The Amusement Park is great, but the Water Park is just ok. Can be very long lines and not too much to ride. The Wave Pool is ok, just know that they make you get out like every 15 to 20 min. for testing and training (while we were there).",WorldWidePlayer
10,Shut water rides / awful customer service,"I booked the night before a it appeared online all rides were open. On arrival around 1045 I was told by a lifeguard most (5 major flume/water rides) were shut due to lack of staff. What rides were open were great though. Around midday I spoke to another member of staff who claimed they had maintenance problems effecting the rides. When challenged about this he directed me to customer service. I was then met by a very prickly female at CS who claimed only two were shut which was wrong, that more would open later and offered no apology. Very disappointed!",Anthony D
40,2 hours from arrival to actually getting into park !!!!,"We arrived at 10.30 when park opens. Queued to get into car park and paid $20. Queued to buy entrance ticket. Cheaper by $10 to buy a season ticket for 2017. $79.99 each to get in and there are 5 of us. Queued to go through security search. Queued to get piece of paper from ticket office turned into a plastic card at customer relations. Queued to get 3 fast pass tickets as park so busy if you don't you may only get on 4 rides. $80 each for three fast track. $579.95 spent, we've been here two hours and we haven't been near a ride.Rides are good and great fun but you have to stay till 20.00hrs close as you will not get money's worth on rides. Food is very expensive and long queues. You can buy a refillable cup for $15. This can be filled up at lots of outlets, if you queue!!Food is typical burgers, pizza etc and all pretty trashy.Park looked clean and staff reasonable friendly.I feel Disney and Universal are so much more organised which just makes it such a more pleasant day.Wouldn't go again.",Andrina L

50,Six Flags Hurricane Harbor,Hurricane Harbor is a great place to spend the day with your family when looking for something to do on a hot summer day! Lots of water attractions and cabanas for rental as well.,Danscvx
40,"Fun place, long lines","Great place to spend a hot day. Be prepared to stand in line, at least 15-20 min, sometimes more, for each ride (and this was at the end of August, can't imagine the peak season!). We had a lot of fun, but were disappointed to find rides closed or rides that didn't open until mid-afternoon. It's not cheap. In addition to the entrance fee, you will pay $20 for parking, $15 for a locker and then whatever you eat or drink. Outside food and drink (picnic style) aren't permitted, but we did bring in apples and clif bars and saw other people with snack items like that, and there were drinking fountains w/chilled water.",BudgetTravller
40,Way better than expected...,"Visited on a Friday (26th/schools back)and we were very impressed with it all*.There are various comments re Lazy River being dirty. There were 1 or 2 leaves in the river, but that's because it runs through a picturesque setting with flora! Otherwise it was perfect.Queuing varied between 5 minutes --> 40 minutes (for the bigger rides).Lockers available as well as changing rooms.Big wave pool with giant screen showing cartoons then a film prior to closing.Superb range of slides for all thrill levels.**TIPS**The floor DOES get hot so footware is recommended but more so because it can be very slippy in areas.Limit your bag size. Lockers are available but on a sliding scale. Small lockers are cheapest. Medium and large available.Rings are needed for various rides which can be picked up at the ride (lazy river only exception). However you can hire rings @ $7. If not, wait til mid afternoon and you should be able to pick up blue-rings from departing quests.If collecting the free tshirt (shopping pass), this has to be got from the theme park next door. Don't leave til the end, as you won't get access.Overall (and compared to UK parks), this was an absolute joy. It was clean, well organised and some great rides. Safety was paramount as seen with all the lifeguards and other ancillary staff.Water stations available around.*$20 for parking, $14 for locker. Food/drink can't be bought in so pay $$$.",Crazysurfkid
10,Never again,"Where do I start? Like most reviews on here, price plays a part in the whole experience. The saying you get what you pay for!!We went for a day (not a busy day) and on entry we found 7 slides closed! Which didn't leave much more left. We carried on with our day but as it went on we saw the park close the wave pool for no apparent reason for about 30 minutes and then re open it!We went to guest services who are poor at handling any guest issues! We were offered return passes but they didn't understand we were from the UK and wouldn't be returning any day soon!We asked to speak to a manager as we wanted a refund due to al the rides that were closed and we were told that the supervisor what the highest member of management there was! Cody was scripted and very capable of fending off any attempt to complain with a good knowledge of rules and regulations! At times pointing out that Six Flags do not give refunds!We left guest relations and headed to the other side of the park only to find another ride closed. We asked a member of staff who was around and her response was to the point "" I have no clue what's happening around here""We went back to see Cody the supervisor in guest relations who told us the rides were under general maintenance and every attempt was been made to bring them back up (this was now 2pm and they were out of action all day)The level of service is shocking;A member of staff at a food outlet told us that most of the staff had gone back to school so there was less people aroundSome rides only have 3 rings on them so queues were building up ( due to the other rides that had closed)Guest Relations will not deviate from scripted responses and will not allow you to talk to anyone higher in the parkSoft drink syrups were out so you queued to get a drink and you found out that it was off so had to queue again (no one checked even when I raised it)Hand sanitiser machines in guest relations were empty, no one has bothered to check them at all (even when raised)To top it all, you have a choice to rent a rubber ring for $7 a day which you have to have if you want to use the lazy river!The add on charges are steep, parking, front of line passes, rubber rings, drinks capsules (If you don't buy one then the price of drinks is really expensive)The water park wasn't really worth the drive out or the use of a day of my holiday and the theme park next door has some great rides but they also suffered from poor customer service and ride outages.The park looked and get understaffed and I wouldn't be surprised if they were closing the rides due to staff shortages (covering lunches rides seem to need maintenance)Better ways to spend your money and time in my opinion, I won't be returning.",Sirrah4941
40,Go off peak season,"Based on other reviews I was very unsure if our visit would be fun. I was pleasantly surprised we had a great time. I'm glad we went when the local schools are in session. It wasn't crowded and the lines were very short. There was plenty to do. The park was cleaner than I expected.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the food prices are too high.I recommend renting a cabana, the service and not having to wait in long food lines was worth the price.",subrogoddess
20,Ok... but read my review.,"The good: Nice park, good variety of rides, good atmosphere.The bad: Prices are high even compared to other theme parks.The UGLY: VERY UNDERSTAFFED. We went it wasn't all that crowded and it still took about an average of an hour to go down a ride. It was very frustrating. Very poor flow patterns for people to go on rides. Extremely understaffed in food areas. You can't bring in water, drinks or food. You can buy an all you can drink cup, but it will take you over 30 minutes to get a refill. Very poorly staffed.I'm not sure I would want to go back here. Again, very expensive,even for theme park standards and sub-par experience.",pshuster72
30,semi great experience just a little dirty,"The lazy river has way too many trees surrounding it that all the leaves and dirt just fill the bottom of the river leaving your feet filthy. Unlike Soak City, this place makes you purchase all rafts. They do not supply free ones or they just do not inform you of where to get them. As for life jackets, again, unlike Soak city, there's only one location to get a life jacket and that is the rental spot. Soak city has life jackets at all ride entrances. My son and a friend went on a ride and they got stuck in the tube and another rider was allowed to go. Riders are not allowed to go down until the other rider has reached the bottom.. definitely made me uncomfortable. All in all, not a clean place.",TCG
10,Go elsewhere-- closed for no reason,"I was at Hurricane Harbor yesterday. The park closed 10 minutes after we arrived. No refund for $20 parking or $16 locker or two tickets. Spent 2 hours on the road to get there and went on one ride. Was also told that they closed because they have a ""policy"" that they close if attendance is low. This is crazy-- the few of us who were there lost our money bc they weren't making enough money. The only closure policy published is for extreme weather-- it was cloudy yesterday. No lightening or thunder or wind. The only extreme weather was their treatment of guests who were thrown out of the park for no reason whatsoever. I'm very disappointed in the high cost and low regard for their guests. Next time, I will go to Schlitterbahn or Hawaiian Falls and will steer clear of Hurricane Harbor.",Jaymee H
30,Disappointing and closures,"So, prior to visiting we researched a number of water parks and HH looked interesting so we booked and started to look forward to visiting.Shortly after our arrival we found a number of rides shut, nothing had been mentioned on the website that morning or the night before.We spoke to one attendant and he said it was due to staff shortages. Guest Relations said it was due to the delay in getting safety sign off from the manufacturers... You decide...We bought some ice creams towards the end of the day and the place was not tidy, as the photos suggest. Ok, some visitors are messy but where were the staff to clean up.On the positive side, the rides that were open were good... Especially the flagship one where the floor drops beneath you and you plummet downwards...",Sanjiv S
10,Rip off,"I will never go here again. Very expensive, dirty and inefficient. The queues for the rides were long and slow. Only a limited amount of free inflatable rings therefore you have to wait for them. If there were more of these the queues would be non existent. Long queues for food and drink as some of the counters were closed.$16 to rent a locker is absolutely crazy and $7 to rent an inflatable ring which should be free. Food and drink poor quality and expensive. SHAME ON YOU SIX FLAGS",adam17310569
10,Don't Bother!,"We were disappointed from start to finish!!First disappointment is having to pay $20 for parking!! We then paid $80 for us to get into the park, which we expected. But we didn't expect to have to pay $16 to hire a locker for the day, or to pay $7 per rubber ring to hire for the day (we also travelled with 2 other couples and a child.. So that was $49 just on rubber rings). We weren't going to purchase the rings however, there are only a limited amount of free rings per ride. For example.. One ride had 4 slides and you needed a rubber ring to ride, whilst waiting in the queue we realised they only had 10 free rubber rings circulating which explains the huge wait for this particular ride.There was a good selection of rides at the park.. However, we only managed to get on 3 rides all day. We waited over an hour for each ride that we did eventually go on. And then spent the rest of the time in the lazy river/wave pool as we were fed up of queuing.One of our friends brought their 2 year old child.. When entering the wave pool we were told that she needed to have a life vest on (even though she had arm bands on).. You can rent the life vests for free in the park. However, they didn't have any 'small' life vests left, so we were told she was unable to enter the pool.You are not allowed to take your own food and drink into the park!!!!! So of course, the food and drink prices were so expensive. Lunch was expensive and the food wasn't that great!!We purchased a refillable drinks bottle for $16, which is great in theory. But if you have to wait 30-60 mins each time to refill, it's pretty pointless. We waited an hour to purchase the cup originally and then waited around 30-45 mins each time to refill. The small food/drink shacks also close earlier than the main food place (the first one closed not long after 3 and the second closed at 4). Also, the shacks had two windows to order from, but only 1 window was open on each shack (ALL DAY!!). Which was ridiculous considering the heat and the amount of people in the park wanting food/drink.We ended up leaving early as we were fed up of the queues for rides, queues for drinks and we were fed up of spending money.Don't bother going!!",Katie M
30,Fun day with friends,"I went to Hurricane Harbor in 2015 with my brother and boyfriend. We had a great time as the weather was amazing and he rides are definitely fun. Being in the water is the best when it's 90+ outside. I was very disappointed with parking and food. The parking lot is horribly designed, there are no trees (which makes your car a giant oven!), it's very hard to find your car, and the price is outrageous, $20 for one day (considering you already pay for your ticket - and it's not cheap). The food is not healthy at all, lots of sweets and fried stuff. Not suitable for kids in my opinion (plus it is very expensive too). I really think it's not ok to forbid people to come with their own food. I would definitely park my car somewhere else or use public transportation next time. When you're there, you really feel like Six Flags is a money machine.",Melanie G
20,Family Trip,The place was extremely overcrowded. My son has epilepsy and cannot get on any slides with our us. When we asked the life guards if we can go with him they were being very rude and said no. Why would they charge a child with special needs full price if they can't get on any slides. I was extremely disappointed. I will not being going back.,Alex G
40,Slide away!,"Took my teenage nieces and nephew to hurricane harbor this month. We all had a blast. Lines for slides weren't that long, but it would've been faster if we rented tubes of our own. For the most part if you had tubes of your own there's a separate line and it moves much faster.other than that you have to wait for the yellow tubing that's provided. The food was a bit expensive at least I thought . 5 burger combos and 2 drinks( six flags bottles) for $109 dollars. We waited for almost an hour in line just to order our food.not sure why it was taking so long, but hopefully that speeds up in the future. Make sure you're clear about what bottle you order. I asked to get the bottle for the day( pink) and was charged $ 15.99 for one and$22.99 for the other and didn't realize until afterwards and didn't feel like waiting another 45 minutes to have this corrected. There are many slides to choose from, ranging from enjoyable to intense! But of course fun! I would definitely recommend this place.",Cali4niagirl87
30,So much room for improvement,"My 10 year old nephew was visiting and we decided to do a water park so I went with 2 friends and their 4 kids (10,10,7,6). One has a season pass and is very familiar with the park. The rest of us had never been there before. Because we had a large group we decided it made sense to have a cabana so we rented a cabana - gold level because platinum was not available.We had gotten some advice from another friend who visits frequently so had a few ideas.We also got gold flash passes so we could avoid waiting on long lines in the sun with all the kids.So I'll break it down and evaluate the park, the passes, and the cabana.Cabana first: I mentioned we wanted the platinum cabana but it wasn't available. When we got to the park we found out there is only one platinum cabana. All cabanas hold up to 8 people. Platinum comes with 8 tubes, a fridge and a safe and ""upgraded furniture"". It's also on a wood deck. The upgraded furniture is basically brown woven outdoor furniture - 4 chairs and a low table and 4 chaise lounges. It is set back about 30 feet from the pool in Cabana Cove. Gold cabanas are also in Cabana Cove. We were in cabana 3. Gold cabanas are in the sand (which will make your feet, shoes and anything else you put in it turn white). The sand is not very clean - there are cigarette butts, old wristbands and other trash in it. The cabana had a round glass table with 4 plastic chairs and 4 chaise lounges with cushions. When I got to the cabana there was sand all over the cushions so I shook them out. The cushions had stains and didn't look like they get washed often.The cabanas have waiter service which doesn't start until the restaurants start serving. But the waitstaff is horrible. There are only 1 or 2 people for all the cabanas and they have to deliver all the food you order themselves. We ordered a pizza family meal (16 inch pizza with 4 drinks), 2 chicken strips meals (which are supposed to be incredible) and a burger. We also ordered 3 slurpees. The waitress made 3 trips to deliver all the food and didn't remember our drinks. It took us 15 minutes to find a server to tell them this and they told our server. The chicken strips (like the park) were average. The drinks were bottled sodas which they brought paper cups with - no ice. Look, I wasn't expecting a gourmet meal, but it would have been nice to have at least decent service with the ok food.Next - flash passes. There are multiple levels which I think is lame. The more you pay, the faster they are supposed to be. Honestly, if you get there early, lines are short so no need for the passes. But they are nice for the afternoon. You have to make a reservation to use them by scanning them at these kiosks all over the park and choosing the ride. You only get to use them once for each ride but you can pay more to use them twice.Finally, the park in general - I guess you get what you pay for. It's much cheaper than other parks in the area (Universal Studios, Disney) and the quality of the service is also much lower. The place is jammed with season pass holders (which is a no brainer if you are local) and I have to say I was pretty shocked at the behavior of many of the guests at the park. We waited in line to get in and when they opened the gate to move the line to the turnstiles, several people who had been on line behind us (including a woman with a stroller!) ran ahead of us and got on line in front of us. There is a ""ride"" that is supposed to be a ""lazy river"" where you can float around on a tube but instead you are constantly being bumped and pushed by the tons of guests trying to zip around the pool. There are only about a dozen rides (although most of them give you a choice of slides to come down so you can try them different ways. Most rides are for kids over 48"", a few lower the cutoff to 42"", but I wouldn't take kids shorter than that - just take them to a great pool...Bottom line - I won't be going again - there are several other water parks in the area that I would try first, the place is crowded with many badly behaved guests, and service is poor. If you go, just get there early and snag a chair in the shade by one of the pools, no need for a cabana. And if you plan to stay the whole day, consider getting a flash pass and using it in the afternoon.",Deborah A
40,Food court,Great place to visit!! Just food court is not good. Waited about almost an hour to order and get our food. Expensive for the souvenirs especially if you still have to pay to use it.,Hector O

50,Weekend visit,The park was nice and different rides was thier but comparing with six flags america in the DC it will be small..One negative feedback is the waiting lines ... i dobt recommend to go in the weekends and holidays...,Ameer E
40,Fun waterpark,"So we went on a Saturday in the middle of summer. It was crowded! Still, the kids had a great time. We didn't hit too many of the bigger slides, as our kids are a tad on the chicken side. They loved the wave pool, the lazy river, and the smaller slides.We did eat snacks and pizza here. It was actually good. I was sort of surprised.I have to say, it's the people that make this place less than attractive. I saw a woman change her kid's diaper and leave the dirty diaper on the chaise lounge! Yep, that's right. She couldn't be bothered to throw it away. There was lunch trash also left behind (on the ground) by people. I guess they just expect the employees of the park to clean up after them. It's really sad.All in all we will be returning. As I said, the kids (8 - 10) loved it!",Jenn J
30,He who pays gets in this place.,"Expensive!Need flip flops so you don't burn your feet on the concrete going to or waiting for rides.Queues are unnecessarily long.Food court is terrible, only caters for meat eaters. Queues are never less than 30minutes long & for catering outlet it is disorganised, food is extremely limiting, below average & expensive*Get the flash pass and rental tubes as you skip the queues.He who pays gets.*BEWARE: rivets on swimwear not allowed on slides - for a small fee $5 you will be provided with something to cover them.",TeiDiver

40,A fun experience,"This was my first water experience in a long time, My friends and I had a really fun time,we purchased the flash pass which saved us a lot of time,in between waiting for the rides we were able to enjoy the wave pool,this was a lot of fun.I would recommend to check out the tornado,it's hands down the best ride in the park,we did it twice,tiki falls and Bamboo chute are fun rides too,overall one of the best Saturday experiences of my life",kashyap s
30,4th july get away!,"Well upon getting into the water park on are first day july 2nd the place was very busy. We went to the cabana area to rent a cabana and got awesome service. As we have a child with a medical issue and doesn't like the sand. So we asked for a cabana without sand and they had none available but a manager there went out of his way to help us and he put us in a perfect place for are needs. Thank you Chaz.As for other members of the park they should be trained by him as there customer service was very bad.We were in the lazy river and there was a boy like 5 years old and lost his family, we seen him as a life guard was just blowing her whistle over and over and not moving to help this little boy that was crying and afraid. So we helped this boy get to someone that could help him.Also don't ride the tiki slide unless your young. I'm over 50 and going down the slide was flipped over in like the 3rd or 4th turn and hurt my knee and whip my neck that now hurts and other things so I woke up in pain so we won't be going back for are last day. Also the last day is the 4th of july we now will stay in are hotel till later tonight and try to go see the fireworks later tonight. Not happy about this. Not only that they have no special needs passes for special needs kids at the water park so keep this in mind!",TRAVELER_MAN01
30,Ouch,"Crowded, lines, and barely any space to put your towels down. Oh, make sure you have sandals or flip flops on all the time because you'll burn your feet on hot concrete getting to or waiting for a ride. Not kidding! Once you realize this, It makes it really inconvenient bc you have to carry your footwear with you on rides.Flash pass is worth it if you can spend extra $$.",daTravelGal
30,Way too crowded,"Way too crowded and lines way too long, I guess to be expected on a hot day. Not to our liking won't return. Very difficult for a disabled person to enjoy.",LaVerne C
40,Great for a hot day,This was our first visit to Hurricane Harbour. We got the season passes which included Magic Mountain. The park had opened for the first time this season while we were there. The lines weren't too bad but not all slides were open straight away. I found the pools and slides really cold but the kids didn't seem to mind. We had our gold season dining passes so we ate in the park. Lines can get quite long so try to eat during non peak times.,Loz212
20,It's not an easy place to visit,"The lines to get in start the chaos as the are no real cues, just mobs and everything you do reflects this . Standing in line for a hamburger took one hour , they just don't handle crowds well.The pre season pass was a steal and frankly but cheap get cheap. It's fine but certainly not a five star experience",Steven F
30,Kids playgrounds,When me and my 5 and 9 year old go we hang out the whole day on the play grounds the whole time. There are no lines to wait in and we love it when the gigantic bucket of waiter dumps and soaks every one! The only other ride my youngest can go on is the family raft ride but that line is always the longest. IfYou are under a certain height you have to wear a life vest to go in the water. Sometimes they run out so you may want to bring your own.,Rachel L
50,Fun in the Sun,"Seems small on the outside, but it has a ton of attractions. The good thing, is you don't have to walk to much. Has slides for adults and for kids. There is something for all ages here. If you will need a locker, be ready to pay $$$. The showers only have Ice Cold water, and if you want food... be ready to wait! Food lines are ridiculous.",Swishy68
50,Nice range of slides and water rides - Loved it!!,"We came down in July from San Jose. Its worth the drive. Warning, entry fee is not part of Gold Pass unless you have pass from local park. It's a big park and fun for all ages.",Susi S
20,Disappointed,"We've been to a lot of water parks and were disappointed with this one. It's small to begin with and many slides were closed. It didn't seem very busy yet the lines were crazy long. It felt dirty and had a bad odor. Plus it sucked they only accepted cash. It's OK for a visit, I guess, but not one we are anxious to return to.",Stacey7755
50,DOT,This is definitely the kids favorite summer park. The park offers a nice variety for all ages. The kids use the large slide down to the lazy river. This park is worth money.,David T
20,Very BLAH,"We live in San Diego and have a water park called Aquatica, owned by SeaWorld. This water park was sooooo not worth the drive. We ended up leaving, throwing on random clothes and walking over to the theme park instead.Their lazy river was FILTHY & we had to swim or walk around it because, unlike the water park we're used to, the tubes were rented out at $7/each and not free! Their supply of tubes at each attraction isn't plentiful, so you have to stand in line at each attraction and wait for people to come down and pass the tubes off. There were SEVERAL rocks on the pavement, which everyone in my family stepped on in different parts of the park. WEAR WATER SHOES!!!!!! The kids' area was the the best of the park. There's this HUGE bucket that filled up with water and dumped on everyone. What a BLAST. Everything else was pretty basic. Lines took FOREVER. LOVED the locker feature!!!!!!!!!! $17 well spent. You can go in and out as much as you like for the time you're there. There was maybe one cool ride there...the floor disappears from beneath you and you go down at about an 80degree angle. Over all, not a fan. The one in Maryland is a lot better.",NeneFavors
10,Shambles,"This place is so badly managed. Once you actually managd to get in, after the poorly staff entrance, the park itself is ok. Lines for the rides averaged an hour with the worst queue management I have ever seen. When looking at the queues they appear small, however there are groups of people held prior to the ride waiting to join. Worst of all was the food queue. We wanted a burger from 'Cowabunga'. There were only 5 people ahead of me and it still took an hour. It was truly amazing to see. After ordering my burger, which was offered with salad, I was told that they didn't actually have salad. I ordered a diet coke, only to be told we don't have any diet left.After our experience, I wouldn't go again. That said, it was a management issue, you may get a better day that would have improved our whole experience.",Johnru
50,Great family outing,Great time and place was not a long lines for the ride as well as for the food. Had plenty of time to ride all ride and still have time to spend on their lazzy river.,eddies951
10,Water park,As we Walked in there was barely no space to seat. Place was packed and full. Still they were getting ppl through the door. I went to explain that because the lack of seats I wanted a refund.... 'Because of the policy blag bla bla .... I couldn't have the same experience as everyone one else seating on the floor or could I ? Left fuming without anyone saying even sorry. Absolutely horrid of that place.Dated and needing updates.,JR G JR G
30,Fun but not as great as other water parks I've been to,"Most of the slides were real fun for me. There were two drawbacks:very few free tubes on Lightning Falls slide. (You can rent one for the day and use it on slides. If you don't do that, you will have to wait for long on that slide);falling off a tube and hitting my head on one of the Tiki Falls slides. I was really trying to stay on the tube but it turned over in the middle of the ride and the rest of it the tube was on me instead of me on the tube! I would have thought it happened accidentally somehow, but the same thing happened to the guy who was riding before me!I liked it in general, but it's not on the list of my most favorite parks.",driamland
40,Great fun,This place is a lot of fun. I don't do rollercoasters but I like water parks. There is something for kids of all ages and comfort levels. The food is...well...theme park food and is pricey. The bathroom/changing rooms are kind of gross. You go for the rides.,Belterish
40,"Lots to Do, Great Fun for Families","We were amazed at how many things there were to do here. There are water slides, from very high up, and water tubes with inter-tubes that are great fun. There are wading pools, splash island where everyone gets soaking wet, chairs to lounge in, a great wave pool and rafting you can also do on a makeshift river. Great fun, great staff, mostly local high school kids who are well-trained, and lockers for storing items you don't need. When it is time to eat, prices are much higher inside the park. And, if a weekend, the lines will be very long and very slow.",Bill G
40,Great day,"We visited hurricane harbor on a Wednesday at the end of August. It was a beautiful hot day. The place was pretty much empty. If we had to wait 10 minutes in a line, that was long. Unfortunately, due to the place being empty, many of the food stands were closed as well as 2 rides. Definitely wear water shoes or flip flops because the pavement is too hot to walk on. Food is expensive but that's what's to be expected. You must rent tubes for the lazy river which is ridiculous but I knew that by reading reviews. Water was dirty in the lazy river but there are lots of spots that people can get in and out bringing in debris. I think because school had started there weren't many kids. We would go back but only during the week. Water was warm and staff was friendly.",Dawn R
10,Couldn't stand having to keep shelling out more money,"We escaped Magic Mountain to cool off at HH, so I had already spent a lot of money, before paying for HH. Thus to find it was $14 for a single bag locker! Then $7 for a single ring - multiply that by your number of children! Then $5 for a drink! Aargh!!We didn't go for rings and that then limited the number of rides we could go on. Couldn't find a map anywhere, but on walking round it seemed most needed the rings!And a couple of tube rides ( we could do) were closed. They kept shutting the wave pool every hour for '15 minutes safety training' !Just got the impression it was a complete ripoff and they were shutting things down as it was towards the end of the season and they were shortstaffed.I was mugged!",sbizzle
10,Visit to 6F Hurricane Harbor,"Cost a fortune - dont think it ends when you book on line. When you've paid for parking, lockers, extortionate food and drink (cos heh ho you can't take your own in) you'll near double what you paid to get in. Long walk from the car park in searing heat. Check online what you can and can't take in to save a long walk back to the car. Water had all leaves and bits in it (tissues and napkins). Rides close with little warning. The wave pool closed for 'safety checks', which seemed to entail the staff jumping in and having a laugh?? BURNT my feet on the dark surface whilst walking between rides. Also, the pebble dashed steps up to the rides really hurt. Surprise surprise they sell sandals in the shops!!! Didn't check what price but assume high. Never had to wear sandals at other parks. For the first time ever burnt my arm on the slides - enough water going down? The only thing worse than today would be to go back when it's busy. Wouldn't go back even if it was free. Sorry 6F but very disappointed and regret expense.",Mark H
30,Good if you can ignore drawbacks,"Was dreading the day here as I couldn't imagine enjoying a water park but it was suprisingly good fun. We had the gold flash pass which meant minimal queuing - I'd imagine that without it we'd have had a very different experience.The big downside is the food - you can't bring your own in but and service was slow, order incomplete and we were given a slushy with a bug in it (which the staff thought we'd simply want replaced when we mentioned it - as if. Eventually led to free food and drink all day).Get there early to secure seats in the shade (Cabanas available but extortionate). Be prepared to be 'taxed' all day (e.g. extra charges for lockers + rubber rings which are pretty much essential) and try not to wear trunks with rivets (rivet covers available for $6 but a pain to fit).Only other problem was one of the slides (cobra?) where kids kept getting stuck - didn't seem dangerous but some were understandably scared at needing to be pushed through by next slider)If you can manage all of this you should have a good time!",EricWhite74
50,Good family fun,"Make sure to purchase the Gold Flash pass (yes, it basically doubles your admission), otherwise you stand in lines for almost every popular ride. Food is a little pricey, but overall its good for a family get away. Oh yeah, make sure you wear beach shoes or sandals, the concrete pavement burns your feet when the sun is out!",ST1300Rider
40,Great day out for the well-organised!,"Lots of fun for the kids on a hot day. As always with this kind of theme park, you have to get in line before it opens. Saw lots of latecomers searching for a sunbed base. Lines manageable, even for the food. Really got our money's worth by purchasing the green refillable drinks cup (and remembering to take it with us!).",Gerry H
40,Worth the trip- great day!,"My favorite water park so far. i like the fact that there is something to do for all ages and even if you are just hanging around, there are lots of lounge chairs and spots to sit and enjoy doing nothing. Water slides were a blast and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful! we had a 4 year old, 16 year old, 13 and 10 year old and there was something for all of them.",Jildac
20,Badly organised and disgraceful staff,Once in the park it took staff 90 minutes to allocate us the cabana we had pre booked. We were initially sent to 3 locations to check in. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing. It was chaos and badly organised. Finally getting our cabana we discovered the queues !! Over 2 hours for most slides. After 5 hours in the park and only managing 2 slides we left. Very disappointed with what turned out to be an expensive day. Too many people in the park and inadequately trained staff,Sharan1968
40,"excellent thrill slides for teens, and excellent water play area for little ones","MUST BRING FLIP FLOPS - CONCRETE IS SCORCHING Sunscreen a must, we are from the area and wore sunscreen AND reapplied once but were burnt anyway. Went on a middle of the week day and lines were manageable, just enough seating. Family locker (jumbo $20) was huge. If you have a locker you don't necessarily need a chair because there is very little sitting time. Bring your Six Flags sport bottles(cheaper with annual pass), same refill policy as Magic Mountain. Only one restaurant open ranging from $7 to about $15 single serving. Pizza, salads, hamburgers, sandwiches. Bar area served bottled beer and canned Limearitas for about $10. No privacy in changing room and floor was extremely slippery. Children's water play area was clean and looked like a lot of fun. Their lazy river was not clean. Mostly leaves and plant parts, but also bees and live spiders floating next to you. Would get other people's hair that was floating in the water tangled in my fingers. Got worse as the day went on, needed to be shut down and skimmed throughout the day. Wave pool was nice with minimal plant ""droppings"". For the slides, people who rented tubes ($7 for single $5 with annual pass) didn't have to wait in line for a free tube. Our teens really enjoyed the slides. PLENTY of lifeguards everywhere.",7seekers
30,Decent water park but not enough searing,"We spent a day at hurricane harbour with our two 15 year old boys. We were unable to find any seating of any kind throughout the day and there was very little shade available which made it difficult on a warm day . Decent lockers and lots of places to eat. Typically expensive as captive audience and bags are checked on entry for food being brought in, we even had 1 can of diet coke confiscated. They let far too many people in and waits were considerable for the attractions. There is a fast track scheme available at a cost of $30 which helped. We went to Raging Waters in San Jose earlier in week and although less rides it was much more spacious, cheaper and better run that Hurricane Harbour. We were basically disappointed with our experience. Can't really fault the rides which were definitely thrilling but left feeling short changed.",Jay L
50,Was great,"This was a great water park. Pay the extra for the gold fast pass, well worth the extra. The lines were very long some were a 2hr wait but with the fast pass you get right up in the line we also got a cabana that also is worth the extra if you start gettin sun burned you have a place to take a break out of the sun.",Cindy W
50,An enjoyable family fun day,I love bringing my children and their friends to Hurricane Harbor. It has a good variety of slides for all ages and enthusiasts. It is very clean. It is the perfect size park where you feel safe that you can let your teen children experience and enjoy the park while you sunbathe or enjoy the riders yourself. The food is good. You definitely need to bring swim shoes or flip flops to keep from burning your feet because the ground can get very hot.,Kimiko M
10,Worst experience of a water park,"I visited the park on Saturday 1st August. It was very busy and it took about 30 minutes to purchase a ticket. You then have to go through a security check before proceeding to the ticket barrier. It was a very hot day and I was unable to find any available sun beds and it was clear the park had insufficient shade for guests to shelter from the hot sun. The park does not charge for sun lounges but you have to pay $7 to rent a single tube or $14 for a double. The park also operates a fast pass for an additional price of $20 per person, which gets you entry to each of the slides to beat queues. However, to enjoy this on tube slides you really need to purchase a tube. This is the issue I have with the park, I paid a ticket price on the gate and it was very clear that the park had insufficient tubes in operation on each of the rides. The queues were horrendous and in 6 hours I managed to go on three rides. The park does not allow you to take in your own food or drink and the queues for drinks were again another 30 minute wait.I have visited lots of water parks but have never seen a park so full that the experience was not enjoyable and certainly not value for money I have left feeling very disappointed at the experience.Six Flags need to try much harder",Paul M
20,"Six Flags Saturday, Hurricane Harbor Sunday, A fun filled weekend ends in disapointment.","My family of 5 went to Six Flags on Saturday 7/25/15 for a Company Picnic, we had a great day, then decided to go to Hurricane Harbor on Sunday 7/26/15. So Excited for day 2- we got there early and knew to expect lines, got into the water park got lounge chairs and headed to the rapids ride, with approx. 50 ppl ahead of us, we did NOT expect to stand in line for more than an hour, went down the slide and headed to the next thinking not all the lines would be so poorly organized to get people down the slides, to our surprise the second was just as bad, ride # 4 I believe, stand at the bottom wait for a tube then head up the stairs. The organization of running the slides is in need of help, if you want to just go enjoy the very crowded lazy river with kids loosely swimming everywhere, or the very nice, clean wave pool you will enjoy this park. Honestly the most enjoyable part for us was the kid zone, with the big dump bucket (we had no young kids with us) We sat by the cabana rental area, next to the 3 green tube slides, after much frustration we timed riders, 1 every 3 minutes - that equals 20/ hour, per slide, not sufficient on a hot summer day, Sadly we planned to stay the whole day and drive back to Phx, AZ at night, after about 4 hours of this we decided our time would be better spend on the road home rather than waiting in more lines, we couldn't even get on the slide staircases, the lines were only on the ground, we assumed possible weight requirements? anyways we were very excited - due to the company picnic we attended Sat for World Oil they provided us with 5 tickets to return to Hurricane Harbor in Sept. Now I wish they were to Magic Mountain, we would be happy to return there, however we will not be retuning to Hurricane Harbor even with free tickets, due to our poor first experience that we paid full price for yesterday, I am planning on selling the tickets that were a gift from the company Please Hurricane Harbor correct your methods for getting guests down the slides in a fast pace manor, so its enjoyable for everyone.Sincerely,Family of 5 ( ages 16, 22, 27, 42, 43)",Brittney H
40,This place is ok,I'm giving it a 4 rating because it lacks organization in the lines people get it get out and expect to just walk back in although staff is very nice and polite and helpful but most of all I saw that they were quick to respond to guest suffering from heat exhaustion so that showed my safety is their number one priority but overall food prices are reasonable and great just try to fix the line orginaizations,AjNunez90210

20,"Not the Worst Way to Spend a Day, but you could do better!","WAY overpriced if you do it like we did; got the Flash Passes so we wouldn't have to stand in ridiculously long lines (and get to ride more than 4-5 slides in day) and rented a cabana (to ensure the safety of our belongings and have some shade).The attractions are ""okay"" nothing overly special, I found most of the same things at any other water park in other state's local parks. The customer service is HORRIBLE. The website would not let us book a cabana, so we left voicemails (which went un-returned), my husband spent the better part of 4 hours calling and being transfered around just to be told we had to wait and get one at the park as there was a system error. The turnstyle to enter the park locked up on us and we wer stuck watching hordes of people flood in through every other lane, the ""Park Director"" was standing right there and said NOTHING as the kid running our line walked away with no explaination. Once finally through the turnstyle we approached the Park Director about our experience on the phone regarding the cabana, and he was disinterested at best and offered NOTHING, not even a ""I am SO sorry for the inconvenience""...I don't think he understood we were trying to Give Them More Money!What is the point of buying the Flash Pass on-line when once you get there you have to stand in a line just to get it with everyone else...and then pay ANOTHER $5 each (refundable IF you bring it back) just to get what we already over-paid for...?They need to consider cool-crete, as I watched hundreds of people burning their feet and running from shade to shade or puddle to puddle. Further the beyond idiotic idea of putting the cabanas in a large sandy area was dumb-founding...why would I want to trudge wet through the sand (creating ""muddy legs"") and then take the sand/mud into the next pool or slide?Not well thought out and not worth the trumped up prices...Ooohhhh I almost forgot the bathrooms were a petri dish of nastiness!BE SURE TO WEAR AQUA SOCKS!",kmorgan77
40,Great Way to Escape the Heat,"Been going to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor for years now. It's definitely family-friendly & a fun way to cool off from the summer heat. Most of the ride attendants are fun and playful, and most off the staff is nice and they go out of their way to help you out if they see you might need it (For example, there was a small coupe of children playing with no parents in sight, a few of the children fell and started crying and a staff member ran up the children to help them and stayed with them until they found the parents). Arrive early to get shaded chairs to sit in. Food is great (but pricey as in all theme parks). If you're allergic to bees though make sure to bring your Epi-Pen or medicine with you. I hadn't noticed how much of a bee issue the park has. Other than that, it's a great place to visit during the summer!",andreapumacruz

20,Extremely poor crowd management,"Our family of four went with very low expectations on what was sure to be a busy, crowded day and yet we were still very disappointed. We arrived at the park and the entrance process was VERY long as stated by many other reviewers. We were able to get lounge chairs and that was nice. We rode two attractions and the lines while not seeming to be long, took a LONG time to get through but none as long as the food and drink lines.It took 1 hour and 10 mins to get lunch. Not sure if the park was at capacity but I cannot imagine any more human beings stuffed into one place. Everyone knew it was going to be a crowded, crazy day so why train new staff on such a day? Our food line was a particularly long wait due to training and constant verification of season pass discounts and questions. It just wasn't the appropriate day for training.While looking around the astonishingly long food lines, I saw many people who looked as though they might just pass out. It was SO hot and SO miserable. No shade was provided for the food lines which were so long that they almost completely blocked the flow of foot traffic in a very vital and busy part of the park. There were many kids standing in line with their parents whose poor little feet were trampled by people simply trying to navigate their way to another part of the park or get out of line with their food. This process desperately needs to be overhauled and reimagined.Once you get your food, there was NO WHERE to sit. Many families had no lounge chairs and seemed to be just taking over the food tables for the day. It was quite a sad scene to see desperate parents trying to feed their children, many of whom were extraordinarily cranky after that insane 95 degree, hour-long food line and yet they had no place to go. They wandered in circles pleading with people for their tables. Meanwhile, many if not most tables were occupied by people who weren't even eating. WOW!Not to mention the 40-minute wait to use the women's restroom. I can only imagine what's floating around in that water considering that ridiculous wait time. Really, 40 mins to use a toilet? Unacceptable.And then there are the tattoos. I think we saw the largest collection of obscene, vulgar and hate-spewing tattoos ever. There were many times I had to quickly get the attention of my children to look elsewhere so as to avoid these images and messages. I was surprised to read the tattoo/clothing policy online but there was no enforcement of this at all. It probably sounds like nitpicking but I was shocked at the things we saw and read throughout the day and I am anything but ultra-conservative.The wave pool is an absolute disaster waiting to happen. WAY too many people crammed into a tiny place, with inner tunes abound and small children just waiting to be lost underneath them. I was terrified to even be in that area. The lifeguards were numerous and very diligent but I just don't see how they can see enough of the pool with wall-to-wall inner tubes and people.I will say there were MANY, MANY lifeguards in the park. They took their job seriously and were both pleasant and courteous. They are saints. There was also a lot of security but sadly I didn't see too many rules being enforced.The rides we were able to experience (very few) were quite fun and could be worth the money. But the ill-managed crowd just ruined the experience for us.",DFamily525
30,Fun but frustrating,"Some of the rides are brilliant but the organisation is shocking. You basically need to buy the GoldPass - in addition to the standard fare - and rent a ring when you're there. Otherwise, you face the frustrating situation of 100 minute queues for 20 second rides.We bought the normal fastpass but even that wasn't enough. Anyone who had hired a ring could push in front of us on certain rides. Basically, it wasn't clear enough what trumps what. And if you want to do all of the rides, it's extra frustrating because there's no maps or signposts telling you what rides are where! (If you're looking for the Tornado, it's right at the back!).Saying that, when the park quietened down, and queues were no longer an issue, the fun we had on the slides made the day worthwhile and the earlier frustrations were put to one side.",Gareth316
50,"Hurricane Harbor Valencia, Ca","If you want summer fun. You have to go to Hurricane Harbor. The rides are awesome, especially the tornado scary but fun. The kids enjoyed being in the water park. They wanted to stay the whole day. Make sure you take sunscreen, sunglasses, water shoes, water proof camera to take lots of pictures. FYI if you forget your water shoes they sell some in the shops. Don't forget to try the funnel cake. For the adults they sell beer. 🍺 If you plan to go the whole summer buy the season pass & season parking its cheaper.",og b
40,Good for Kids,"We took my 5 year old grand daughter to Hurricane Harbor. We played in the wading pool with small slides and the Lazy River. Both were fun. Lazy River was very crowded and most people walked it. The entrance and exits should be expanded to have an exit followed by a separate entrance. Right now, those entering and leaving get into each other's way. The park should also use a different cement at the wading pool that is not so hot. Other pools do this. Parts of the pool are almost to hot to walk on. Overall, we had a great and refreshing morning.",JEROME T
40,Awesome on a hot day,Went this weekend with my friend and her son. We had an awesome time and it was refreshing on a hot day. no real complaints except for the food. We got burgers for and they were horrible. Not sure what kind of meat they used but it wasn't beef. The lines were not too bad. Overall a fun time.,alison f
40,Third Year in a Row of Family Fun,"For three years now we have visited Hurricane Harbor the first Monday after our kids get out for summer break, twice with our best friends and their kids and once with just our family. Every time we go we have a blast. There are plenty of slides for people of all ages, but this year was better because our boys are now eight, tall enough, and not scared to ride everything (except Banzai, they haven't got the courage for that quite yet).While our experience with the staff this time was not as pleasant as past experiences, I will attribute their unfriendly attitude on the fact that it was extremely hot during this particular visit. This year my husband and I opted to purchase the monthly combo membership and for a family of five it is $55/mo to visit Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor as much as we want for one year. Considering we only live an hour away we thought this would be well worth the money.As usual during our visit the park was clean, except the large punt of leaves floating with us in the Lazy River, but there are a ton of trees and shrubbery in the part so that is to be expected.Waits for rides were not long and the park was not overly crowded.One thing that bothered me was the wait to get into Hurricane Harbor, they've started scanning and handing out the season pass cards at the gate when one goes in and it makes the wait incredibly long. It was nearing 95 degrees at 11:30 a.m. While we were waiting and the short line we were in took almost 30 minutes to get through the turnstiles. That was actually the longest we waited for anything all day. Perhaps an entrance specifically for patrons who need to get their season pass cards would be more efficient for those of us who had already waited once before to get said cards.Other than that the park was fun as usual and we all went home tanned, tired, and full of new memories to brag to our friends about. We plan on returning in a week or so and I hope the next visit is just as fun!",packyourheart

30,Six Flags Hurrican Harbor,"My daughter enjoys it. However, they keep the water kind of cold, especially in their large swimming pool. Be careful with your possessions. Things tend to disappear. In the summer it gets very crowed. Also, parking is expensive. We usually park by the Hyatt hotel and take the Santa Clarita bus to they to Six Flags and back.",MarcOT4L11
40,Best water park in Socal,"I think this is .5 stars better than Raging Waters. The rides in these water parks are never that distinctively different in my opinion. Raging water seems to have more variety. BUT, Hurricane harbour is a lot cleaner, friendlier and nicer. Also my biggest gripe about raging waters - NO SHADE while lining up!! Most of the time you are lining up under the shade for HH.I think in general, Hurricane Harbour is much better managed. The entrance cost is quite low so fees are expected. Tube rentals are not necessary, and only used for the River Cruise. Plus all water parks charge those standard costs anyways.The worst thing about Hurricane Harbour was the initial wait to get in. I arrived at 11am on Sunday, and OMG. The lines were so long. It was the same lines as six flags lines and moved ever so slowly. Very inefficient and unnecessary wait time. I don't get why they couldn't just use two or even one booth dedicated for HH?!After renting out lockers (Super clean and hi-tech!), using bathroom, bring your own water and putting on sunblock, I proceeded to the Mr. Six's Splash Island to wet ourselves from the high 80 degree weather.Reptile Ridge: The first ride was very quick wait. I went on the middle blue (Gator Gorge?) one that was straight down. Gave me a massive wedgie and drank a lot of water. Beautiful. The drop was pretty crazy too, nearly 90 degrees to me and since I didn't expect it, I was shocked! I went on the blue side one (Gecko Gully East?) and it was more chill, kind of hurt my back. The wait for both was only about 20 minutes!Lost Temple Rapids: ""White water action"" you can share with 4 people max, 2 people min. Pretty chill, relatively long for a water ride. The wait was about 40 minutes.Tiki Falls: Pretty fun but not very memorable, you go and grab the two people tubes. Not too long of a line, maybe 30 minutesTaboo Tower: Dare devil Plunge. It went straight down again. Just longer than Gator Gorge, but Wasn't any more steep. Waited about 40 minutes for thisBamboo Racer: Wait was about 30 minutes. Rather short, could be steeper for sure. You wait at the bottom for the toboggan and you go down head first.Boa Constrictor: Do not let the line deceive you! It looks short, but this was the worst wait experienced. It took like an hour! You're supposed to wait for people to hand you a single person tube, since we didn't rent one. But if you already rented one, definitely use it and cut the wait by 70%! It was pretty fun though, but kind of hot because some parts it was completely dark, and you can just feel the hot stuffy breeze that was trapped inside the tubes.Tornado: The best! So fun! A four leaf clover tube - 2 min, 4 max. The tube was hella heavy, but worth it! You swish around. Wait was probably 50 minutesCoiled Cobra : Alright, hurts a little bit but pretty long at 500ft. Wait was only about 30 minutesVenom Drop: 75 ft and another near 90 degree drop! Pretty long one too. Line was deceptively short but also about 30 minute wait. I was a little nervous to go on, but it really wasn't that bad. Only the first drop, made my heart drop, but after that it was pretty smooth. humongous wedgie once again.River Cruise: Kind of boring, went at 6pm and was a little chilly. You need to rent a tube for this, but if you go late like me, there are plenty lying around to take for freeMr. Six's Splash Island: Concluded with this, so fun! Guaranteed to get you soaking wet! 23 slides to choose from and 1 minute wait. Lots of fountains, rain curtains and squirting effects! And of course the HUGE bucket of water that tips over when it's overflowing! Loves it!***Tip: No water, bring cash, if you buy water from the food places it's cheaper and they accept card! Wear flip flops, leave them at the bottom but your feet could get hot =/ but i hate holding onto my flip flops with me when im on the slide. no shirts on slides. i'm also gonna wear board shorts to my next water park to avoid any metal friction! Do not forget to reapply sunscreen especially the face and back!Favourites: Short waits at the beginning. Shaded waiting area most of the time. Kiddy pool is always fun and no wait. Tornado was the best ride. Venom, do it if you dare! Clean lockers! Not overly dirty! Bathroom wasn't disgusting.Do not want: long waits, expensive locker. Expensive food/water. Sharing line with six flags!Last words: Great for a day of fun!",Celine L

40,Ready for fun in the sun and water,"After reading numerous bad reviews about this place, I was not terribly excited about it. I won tickets for this park and had heard horror stories of long lines, no place to sit and outrageous prices on food.WELL....We ended up having a great time. We got there early as per advice here on Trip Advisor. We waited 30 mins for the gates to open in the shade putting on our sunscreen. The whole que area outside both gates one to HH and the other to the amusement park filled with people and alas the gates opened. We once again we had to stand in line for our tickets to be scanned to go in. (MM should devise a better way of doing this...forrtunately no one tried to push or shove to get ahead of anyone else). We got in and claimed some chaise lounges in area under sunshade.We then went and rented our inner tubes at $7 each. You get a wrist band showing you have rented a tube and in case the tube disappears (as in our case this did happen) you can return to the rental area to get another one free of charge. Also, at the end of the day, if you return your tube and you get a free drink voucher.We enjoyed a free slides before the lines started to build and then spent the rest of the day floating in the lazy river and hanging out in the wave pool as well as the splash areas. My daughter is only 10 so this was perfect.The staff was all really friendly and helpful. I had to walk (a really really long walk) back to my vehicle for our towels and had no problem getting back into the park. If you pack a picnic lunch, you could get your hand stamped, go out and eat your lunch and return to the park.We had late lunch (another suggestion by someone here on T.A). Going later, the lines we not long at all. We had a big breakfast so I opted for the kids meal savings some money. My daughter and had the kids meal and my husband a regular burger. The kids meal consist of 2 chicken tenders, some fries, fruit snack and chocolate pudding and a small drink in a plastic cup with lid and a straw. Not very big, but enough to keep me stomach happy until we left. One thing to note is that unless you get their collector cup at $14.99, you will not get a lid on their small or large drinks. Not sure why. They told me no lids in either park. Since our drinks had no lids, the bees swarmed our drinks. My husband got stung because of this. So, since you can bring in water bottles, save an empty one to pour your drink into it. We saw a family who had a ice chest of food as well. Not sure how they got it in, but I would have brought some snacks in since they did not really check your bags that well. Just bury them deep in your bags.All in all, I did not spend a lot of money and we had a lot fun.So here are the TIPS:~Buy water shoes~Do not wear board shorts with metal rivets~Get a waterproof bag for phones and money~If you use a credit card, bring your ID...they will ask for it.~Get in Early~Claim your Chairs after arrival~Get in line for the slides~Bring Bottles of Frozen or Cold Water~Bring Snacks~Rent an Inner Tube--(some people brought their own)~Have Fun and Hang Loose, its a vacation afterall!",ShimaOhana3

30,Fun but....,"Our first time at the Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. A friend of ours recommend that we check it out Magic Mountain but we decided to do the Harbor because it was a hot day. This is an average size with mild to wild slides. They have a river where you can relax in between slides. Some slides were clean and some were not but it was still fun to go down them. Get in early to some pool chairs for your things and a place to relax. It was nice to see that the park thinks of safety a lot and have hired lifeguards in every area. Noticed that some of the staff could not understand English. It is a good walk to the parking lot to the park so it was nice of Six Flags to send a bus to pick up and drop off their guests (no charge). Entry to the parking lot is $20. Noticed that they had staff on the towers watching over the cars while we were inside the park. Lots of lockers to store your valuables and you can open and close it as many times as you want. Location is not central so it can be inconvenient when you need something that you have to walk over. They have a great store of clothing and accessories (prices were competitive). CONS - pricey food and drinks (not healthy), extremely dirty restrooms, extra fees to rent tubes just to relax in the river cruise, to rent cabanas (pricey too). We checked it out and it was not worth renting it. Entering the park was not efficient- you go in to have your bags searched and they wand you up and down, then you go to the next gate and wait for the park to open. We noticed that it got really crowded in the middle. Suggest the park eliminate the gates or open the gates as soon as people come in after being searched. You can bring water but are not allowed to bring other foods and drinks hence you end up buying their food. We are unsure about recommending this place. Bring your wallet.",Marites8

20,Huge Disappointment!,"I love water parks, I have been to many in the UK, Europe and US including Aquatica, Wet and Wild, Blizzard Beach, Typhoon Lagoon, Costa Caribe and Aqualandia. This is by far the worst experience I have had which is frustrating as the park does have potential.First off it is expensive and seems to be organised to maximise the value add services. Don't be fooled by the reasonable $30 pre book entry price. Parking is $20 (it is in the middle of nowhere) and the first thing you notice is there are no rings provided for the lazy river. The options are swim (rather defeats the object especially as the sides are rough and the water rather cloudy) or rent a ring at $7 for a single or $14 dollars for a double and spend the rest of the day lugging it around and looking out for it. The medium size locker was $17 but at least was entered via a keypad so there were no keys to lose.The food we ordered was Chicken Strips and Boneless Wings (strips dipped in sauce) This was poor quality and very expensive for what it was, however the whole pizza looked more appetizing and may have been a better option to split between a family.We had a souvenir cups from a previous visit to magic mountain which we were able to use, a good thing as refills were 99 cents, however attendant tried to bundle ""free drink wristbands"" at $4.99 each.I had this removed as I was not sure we would get through 5 litres of fountain drinks in a day to make them cost effective.After eating we decided to have a dip in the wave pool and just got in when everyone was told to leave the pool for a 10 minute safety break. The reasoning behind this was never explained and I am still baffled by this. We were further disappointed to learn that the two new rides, the Bonzai Pipelines were closed and remained so all day, again with no explanation.Still we queued for our first slide. All queuing is at the bottom of the slide which is a first for me. This seems to be so that the ""Flash Pass"" users ($15 for standard $25 for gold with 50% reduced wait time) are not delayed as there is no alternative route up the slides for them. It makes it hard to judge the lines and also when you are released you have to climb all the steps to the ride in one go which can be hard work in the heat and reduces the anticipation of the ride.It was while in the line I was told we had rivets in our shorts and would not be able to ride any rides apart from those using a ring. Apparently the drainage eyes in the pockets of our shorts are rivets (I am not sure are even metal) and will damage the slides. It is buried in the dress code on the website and there are signs inside stating this without defining what a rivet is (ie an eye!)The options I was given bearing in mind I was with two teenage boys was wear shorts inside out, (impractical as the have supports and pockets inside,) purchase some covers from the store, (they were out of these,) remove the rivets and damage good quality swim shorts (suggested tools were keys or scissors but none provided) or buy some new shorts from the store (not an option for three of us especially as they were quite expensive and not as good as the shorts we had.)After complaining to customer service we gave up and decided to ride the ""ring"" rides. There were further issues as listed below.Not enough staff, usually one at the bottom and one at the top so rides were slow to load.Lines badly policed with people cutting in due to lack of staff and queuing at the bottom.Paths got very hot with little shade making flip flops essential.Lack of family rings for Typhoon and Lost Temple Rapids resulting in waiting for rings to become availableOn the positive side the rides themselves were fine especially the Typhoon slide, most of the staff were fine but there was not enough of them the park was in a reasonable condition and there was a shaded area to sit and eat. With better organisation, more staff and greater clarity on dress code as well as what is included in the entry fee it would have been much more enjoyable.Overall though it was not a pleasant experience and we left early frustrated and disappointed. Not a park I can recommend based on this experience.",Steve F

Lots of staff keeping everyone safe and under control. Loads of seating and if you get there early enough plenty of shade. Various activities for all ages.The bad: very expensive like most parks. We rented a cabana for $150 but i don't think it was worth it, the food service was terrible (min 45 min wait) and the staff was unhelpful.Recommend: spend the money on a flash pass instead of the cabana. The food is pretty gross so eat on the way or when you leave if you can. Tube rental is reasonable but you don't really need it for most of the rides. Bring water shoes as the ground gets super hot.All in all a good day.",Pquintana

Worth it!",PamelaDahhling
40,"Great rides and slides, filthy bathrooms!","While I will still recommend Hurricane Harbor to anyone who wants to cool off while having a blast, the restrooms are filthy and in desparate need of attention. If attendants simply mopped like maybe 3-4 quick times a day with some sort of dissinfectant and there were just a fan or two in each restroom forcing the ventilation, it would make a HUGE difference and completly make them smell better! I don't want to touch ANYTING in there when I need to use the restroom because they are that nasty most the time. I know there is massive traffic, but it wouldn't even matter if someone simply mopped while everyone is in there as the floors are constantly wet anyway!

In fact the next day we were scheduled to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain and my 3 boys that love roller coasters said they didn't want to wait in line. AT Hurricane Harbour if you dont have a fast pass dont even go. We didn't purchase them and managed to maybe get on 2 or 3 slides. The lines are forever and too many people have the fast pass so they get to go in front of you making the ordinary queue endless.,MagicAndrew
40,Great family Park,"Hurricane Harbor is a great pale for all ages. I have kids 15,10 and 7 and they rode all the rides and had a fantastic day! Eating there is way too expensive but you need to look around at prices instead of buying the first thing You see. My advice is to order kids meals- $7.99 with chicken, fries, drink, pudding, and fruit snacks. That's plenty of food for an adult that stands in the heat all day!",D D
40,If you don't mind the germs...,"This is a great place if you have older kids. When I went a couple of years ago, there was not a whole lot I could do with my little children. Once the kids get older, though, it is a lot of fun.I try not to bring valuables. All I take in is a mini dry bag with my phone and some cards and cash. If you need it, though, there are lockers. I have all my kids wear cheap flip flops - on hot days the concrete is literally BURNING hot. They can wear the flip flops around and ditch them by the rides - then retrieve them when they are done.VERY crowded. Plan on arriving before they open so you can be near the front of the line. If you STAY TO THE RIGHT on the way up to the entrances, you will get through faster. FIND SHADE FIRST - near the wave pool is what we prefer because of it's central location - toss a towel on every chair you want - one chair without something on it will be claimed by someone else.Hit the popular rides with lines right away - like Tornado - the line can be up to an hour and a half long later in the day. When the lines get longer then take time in the lazy river and wave pool.The food is expensive, but we really like it. The best value for my family is the full pizza - it is really good - and then we share the drink cups with the refills for $1.TRY to come on a weekday - it is hard to spend the money and then wait all day in lines.",Tasiadoo

The kids had such a great time that the food was overlooked by them. Going back soon.",Corina D
50,Fun Times,Hurrican Harbor is such a great place for the family. It is so much fun and has many ways to create memories. I loved being able to take pictures under water!!,Olga S
40,Best waterpark in SoCal,"Hurricane Harbor has tons of slides and compared to its competition at Raging Waters, the Soak Cities, and Aquatica it has the best slides. Perhaps not the greatest if you are looking for something the entire family can enjoy together if you have young kids, but easily a great place for older families, teens, and young adults looking for thrills that will last the whole day.",Joel B
40,Fun in rides and great in customer service,"My experience in Six Flags Hurricane Harbor was really exciting in rides. There are plenty of rides to enjoy from and the must do's of the experience is Tornado, Bonzai Pipelines, the mat water race ride, and the family raft white slide. To have a best experience at the park you must try to do some of the scary ones like Bonzai pipelines because that ride is scary but really fun.What made my experience not the best it can be was the food because the pizza in Six Flags Hurricane Harbor tastes like old, recooked, school food for around 10.49 a slice of pizza with a combo of bread or small salad. Overall my Six Flags Hurricane Harbor experience was great.",trinacho
40,Something for everyone,"This summer - 2014 - the water park is much cleaner than previous years. The lazy river has been redone and looks great. With so many people visiting the park the lines become long - so arrive early to grab a seat a get a couple of rides in before it gets busy. There are tubes for rent (about $8) to use in the wave pool, the lazy river and the tubes can be used on a couple of the slides. All ages will find something to do - shallow playgrounds for little ones, gentle slides you ride sitting in a tube and of course many body slides from easy going to the fast & super steep. If you only have one day it would be a good idea to get the Flash Pass. All food and drink must be purchased there - burgers, chicken fingers, pizza and a couple of salad options. Valencia is generally hot during the summer so make sure you have flip flops or water shoes to walk around in. Lockers are available and a good idea or get a waterproof pouch for any valuables.",Kelli C
40,"Fantastic Park, get the Flash Pass","Don't listen to any of the reviews that talk about the cleanliness of the park or long lines. It draws all kinds of people and masses of people make a mess. Get there super early, get a locker, wear flip-flops and plenty of sunscreen, but above all, GET THE FLASH PASS. We skipped ahead of people who had waited over an hour, going on one ride three times. By the end of the day it's very crowded and the Flash Pass lines are longer, but it's worth every single penny.",Jack B
50,Great family experience,"Hurricane Harbor was a great experience and value for my family of five. Awesome rides for all ages, and the pricing is right for today's economy. Fit into our budget nicely for a California vacation.",Mark S
10,Wasn't worth the money I spent!,"I am so disappointed in Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Valencia, CA. I took my family to have a good time and to relax. NOT! First, Hurricane Harbor's restrooms are filthy, nasty, dirty. The Health Department needs to shut them down! It's nice that they employ high school and college students, but they really need to do training on customer service. They are some of the rudest son of of guns!As I said, I took my family to have a good time just to be disappointed in the cabana I rented. As part of the agreement to use the cabana I was to get 4 inner tubes, 4 lounge chairs, table w/ chairs, and staff that would take your order if you wanted food all for $150.00. First, I only had 3 lounge chairs, and when I complained I just kept getting the run around. I paid for 4 and I should get 4 not 3! It wasn't until I went to Customer Relations that a chair appeared after 3 hours. No one EVER approached my family and I to see if we wanted any food. We had to get it ourself! At times we saw at least 7 staff members huddled around the little tiki booth just talking. And it was like that for most of the day. It wasn't until after 4.5 hours that someone came to us. I didn't need anything then.I did see a family come from the water and they swarmed them like the bees that kept flying around our drinks!Just before leaving the nasty park, we went to purchase some food to go. My daughter ordered a cheeseburger, the staff member that took our order felt it was appropriate to give my daughter a burger that was sitting under the heat lamp for God how long (I will be notifying the Health Department) the lettuce was brown and wilted, and the bun was rock solid. The girls name was Princess and the boy that helped thought it was funny. I saw NO humor in it at all. All they did was replace the bun and lettuce after I complained. I'm sure they wouldn't have eaten it! I also ordered pizza and Princess again tried to short me on part of my meal. It wasn't until a family behind me corrected her. And lastly, the cups that the drinks came in, around the rim of them they were ALL dirty with brown stuff on them. I am truly insulted by how we were treated......When we went back to the cabana to get our stuff a staff member asked me if I wanted something before they close out for the evening? I told her, no! She said am I ready to close out my tab, I said for what no one helped me not even you so unless you are charging me for the air, bees, and the dirty table I shouldn't have a tab!Hurricane Harbor will NEVER get a dime or penny from me or my family. As a matter of fact I work for a youth center and we will NEVER patronize them again as well. We are going back to Raging Waters or Soak City.",saints2010_11
50,Awesome!!!,"Park is great for all ages!! Fun, safe, friendly, enjoyable atmosphere!!!! Wave Pool and river cruise are a must everyone will have fun splashing through the waves or cruising the river!!! Inner tubes are fun for both the wave pool and river!",Esther O
30,Nice day but . . .,"This park is relatively cheap to get in, we pre-booked at $29.99 per person from the UK, however, the reason it's cheap is that everything inside the park costs a fortune. You have to pay $7 each to rent tubes, drinks are at least $3.50 for the smallest drink and whilst the food is good and plentiful it is also v expensive. This was also one of the filthiest water parks we have ever been to. The toilets need a proper deep clean and totally stink& The gulleys around the lazy river are fully of sludge and debris. Urgh. Whilst it has some great slides the queues are terrible and some have very little shade. We bought gold fast passes at €25 each and I would not even consider going there without doing so. We were able to book onto rides whilst waiting in the pool and avoid lengthy queues. Even so, we did not have time to do all the rides. We also rented a Cabana for 8 (there were 7 of us) which included (only) 4 tubes !! So we had to haggle for more as having paid $150 to rent the Cabana we expected tubes to be included. The Cabanas are a good idea and nice and private in a cordoned off area with a food/drink order & delivery service. But no towels or drinks included. The sing most disappointing thing about the park is the Lazy River (known as the River Cruise) 90% of those in the lazy river have not rented a tube so it is virtually impossible for you to casually relax and float round the river as it does not work when full of swimmers etc. The park should really include the tubes in the entry price. The staff were really friendly and helpful though but don't forget your flip flops as walking round without them is v HOT on your feet!Worth a trip for the good slides but be prepared to cough up and definitely fast pass.",FOXYSKI
50,Soooo much fun,"Haven't been to a water park in forever! Just went last week and had a blast. Come early as the shaded lunge chairs go fast. And if it is a busy day, i would invest in the fast past... makes the day go by so much better. Come prepared with a lot of money because they don't let you bring in outside food or drinks and the food & drinks in the park are very expensive (but hey you are at at theme park what do you expect). Have fun!",MargoHemet
50,First Time Happiness,"Read the rules before you go, make sure you wear flip flops because the ground is HOT! Be prepared to stand in lines or spend the money for a FastPass! Locker was really expensive but WAY WORTH it unless you have Grandma to watch your stuff for you! :-) SUNSCREEN! We had a BLAST and loved the rides when we finally got on them! Only rode a few though because we had lunch and dinner with our dinning passes and also enjoyed Splash Island longer than expected! With teens I thought they would go in, get bored and come back out, but instead, they came back and said it was amazing after a long absence and went right back in! LOL And I enjoyed sitting in the shallow waters off to the side in a time zone all my own. :-) It was a nice break for me. Loved the lazy river and used it often to jump to different parts of the park instead of walking around. All the workers were very friendly....only really bad part was the filthy humans bathroom habits! :-( Wish they had a bunch of dressing stalls with lifted wood slats so you're not having to stand in pools of water at the end of the day to change into your street clothes. :-(",Theresa S
50,Great experiences!!!,"I love this place, it is just an amazing experience. I took a friend and we had a blast. I've gone to Six Flags for such a long time, and every time, I have met great people, and have learned this is like a place away from home.",Joshua S
50,"Great trip, but limited food choices on week day.","Rent a cabana...! especially if you have a large party. Saves on renting a locker, and you get inner tubes and a place to sit. Get there early to get a close parking. spot, and get the flash pass. you only need the minimum,",Stavros M
40,Fun on the Fourth,Our first time there and the whole family had a blast . We thought that being the 4 th of July is would have been crazy busy . It wasn't . We were able to casually ride all the rides . Don't rent an inner tube . You'll get stuck carrying it around . It's just not necessary .foods a little pricey but then again it is an amusement park. Tons of things to do and always a way to cool off . We hag a blast !,625wendyg

30,It's a lot of work,"I downloaded and bought seasons passes so my son and grand kids could go often. We arrived at the park at 1030am and had a twenty minute hike to the front gate. W were told we had to go to will call to convert the passes. After thirty minutes in line at will call we were then told that we had to go to processing ---- another fifteen. Twenty more minutes in line to find that the passes in hand with. Bar codes could not be accessed and we had to go back to will call. I was led to a supervisor at the main gate and had to wait fifteen more minutes to have the ""right"" supervisor On my way! Supervisor then who led us to the will call front of the line. They were having a hard time working it out but finally gave us one day passes. I was told that I needed to then go back to my hotel later re purchase the package so we could then get a credit for the first one.Upon entering the park finally after two hours of delay we went to get lockers. The credit card machines would not work and you had to use cash only. The lines because of this were horrendous. The park was crowded and it seemed it might make sense to rent cabana as waiters are supposed to be there to bring food etc. well the young ladies at that desk could not determine if there were any to rent. The 145 fee was not worth the effort.Finally I found a manager of the park who went back to the desk with me and he too had a hard time discerning if a Cabana was available. I assured a waiter would come buy and being us menus and food. It was not so easy to locate a waiter and finally I had to go back to the desk and ask for one to be sent over.The water slides and the reason to go clearly are fun and the visit was enjoyable but the human customer service focus is not like what you might find at other theme parks. It s not horribly expensive either with a season pass and free parking but beware of the energy it takes !",Steven F

10,One to Avoid,"Although charging similar prices to water parks such as Aquatica or Wet'n'Wild in Florida or Atlantis in Dubai this park will severely disappoint in comparison. There are a number of problems with this park ranging from the staff to the cleanliness in general.Firstly, the park is not clean, the ground had used plasters on it and the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. One of the sun beds had bird poo on it and when brought to the attention of the staff they just offered us a towel to put over it!Secondly, as with most theme parks, the food was truly awful. It's just typical fast food although this can be expected, especially of American water parks.Thirdly, the cabanas are possibly one of the greatest rip offs I've ever seen. $150 and literally all you get is a tent with a table, a few chairs and a few sun beds. The area is supposed to be watched but people can wander through as the staff don't bother to stop people, even though only those with wristbands are supposed to go through.Fourthly, the staff are terrible. They try to do the bare minimum that they can and if an issue isn't directly related to what they are supposed to be doing then they just won't bother. It's quite hard to decide whether this is through stupidity or ignorance although they do a good job of displaying both. There is absolutely no concept of customer service or a level of care to customers at all. When some staff were asked basic questions or asked for simple things they would pass they would state they couldn't/wouldn't help with that.Fifthly, the rides themselves are ok, a few good ones such as Tornado however the wait time, even though the park was quiet, was unacceptable. I'm not exactly sure why this was but for some of the slides it just seemed to be a lack of tubes/staff/infrastructure.In conclusion, if you like water parks or would like to visit a water park, in my opinion, then this is not the one to go for and is not indicative of the quality establishments elsewhere.",Jake9876

40,Great Way To Spend An Afternoon!,"What a great experience! This park offers a nice combination of thrill slides with those that are more tame in nature. The lazy river offers all person's a great opportunity to just float along and enjoy the sights and sounds. Get here early! This park gets crowded, so if you can be there when they open with ticket (or pass) in hand, sunscreen already applied, and ready to ride, you will have a much greater chance of hitting some of the larger slides early before the lines get too long. Hint: If you bought a dining pass for the Six Flags park only, it will not work here. Hint: Although tubes can be rented for a fee, they aren't really needed. LIFE JACKETS ARE FREE!!! Hint: Wear water shoes or flip flops. The ground gets way too hot to walk around barefoot, and it's better to hold your shoes on the rides than it is to risk burning the soles of your feet. Hint: Bring money. Food and beverages are pricey. Hint: Unless you have small children and need lots of items that would require a locker, I would encourage you to walk in with your bathing suit and sunscreen already on, a hat or sun visor, and a small waterproof ID container you can wear around your neck. It's so warm, that you will dry fairly quickly. Towels can be left in the car. This will save you from a locker fee.",VanEsq12
40,Great family fun but bring $$,"Slides are GREAT, lots of room and employees are super friendly!The code of conduct posted about no smoking and polite language is a nice effort but it isn't enforced strongly so if such things offend you, you have been warned. People are hard to control, especially teens. Just know it happens. Also, they do not allow you to bring ANY food in except water. Fine. BUT the food is CRAZY expensive inside the park and the lockers to store your stuff are more than double that at Disneyland so you may want to not bring a phone or wallet or anything of value because you have to leave it on the deck chairs while you go play.The slides are wonderful though and it is a great family day out. Just know what you're getting into as far as money goes.",Jason H
40,Hurricane Harbor Experience,"We love it here! We have Gold Membership passes and use it for both parks! I would have gave all stars but the cost of food & you can not bring in your own.

50,"Lots of fun, but queues are a bit crazy","This might be Six Flags best one. It marries the thrill of really good water slides with the relaxation of a tropical paradise. There are some really good slides here, the Bonzai Pipelines are amaze-balls and the Taboo Tower slides are all great. The only issue here is the crowds and the queues. Be sure to get there as early as possible and try all the slides you can before relaxing (you can relax later in the day when all the others are queuing!) cos once the crowds build up, the queues will become extremely long. Not much to talk about for food here though, really average food. Overall, a great time (if you get to do the rides you want without standing in queues for hours).",Joses T

The park now has a big LED T.V. above the wave pool for occasional later in the evening movies! Really cool! If you forget your camera its no problem for there are plenty of photographers to take a photo for purchase if wished. This is a perfect place to wear the kids out! They will get LOTS of exercise! Make sure water shoes or flip flops are brought because on some summer days the ground tends to get really hot!!

30,Best for elementary aged kids,"Fun water park overall but if you have a small child it may be more trouble than anything else. The ""small child"" area has water cannons that anyone (read older kids and even adults) can use to squirt you and your baby in the face or head or wherever else they aim. Also the ground gets boiling hot. You must have water shoes or flip flops to walk around but you can't wear these on most of the slides.

40,My son loved it..,"I have been taking my son there since he was 2, he is now 3.5. He loves it. Especially the areas for small children. It does get very packed on the weekends. You do have the option to rent a cabana, which i recommend. You can leave your stuff safely there, and it includes cold drinks, chairs/table and everything you need. We rented cabanas a few times, It was great, especially on those hot hot days. I just wish they had some cabanas in front of the small children area, that would be ideal.Parking is still far, but you can always valet, which is not bad at all. Very convenient, if you have little ones.The food is horrible. Unless you eat the pizza, that is not bad. I would recommend to bring your own food. I always brought my son's food and fed it to him there.",Daniela F
30,"Good fun, but...","Good selection of slides but once it gets busier the queues get quite long quite quickly. The staff are friendly and helpful enough but there needs to be a focus on moving people through, even on the platforms with 4 or 5 slides they seem to have to wait until the exit pool down below is clear before letting anyone else go down one of the slides. There has to be a better way to streamline this (maybe it's US thing, being over-cautious on saftey to prevent getting sued), these delays are very frustrating. Food is way,way, way overpriced and mediocre quality.",floydbloke

Was not too crowded at all - longest wait was 20 minutes if that. We did go on a Thursday in August, so that may be why we had less crowds - we found lounge chairs right away no problem at all - there was plenty every where! Bathrooms were clean, pools seemed cleaned - except for lazy river - a lot of leaves, sticks, from the all the plants around the area, but that's to be expected. They have a wave pool that my kids loved - and they shut it down for about 15 minutes every hour to check the status of the water.......which made us feel better about spending most of our day in there!

10,Don't waste your time or money. Go to the beach instead.,"Everything is overpriced. The food is terrible and they do not let you bring in your own food or offer an area to eat your own food like other theme parks do. If you want a tube you have to pay separately for it; with the price of admission you would think you would get a tube to use. The pools are very dirty with a lot of floating debris and things floating past your legs that you're probably better off not know what it was. It wasn't too crowded but it took forever to go down the water slides. You can pay a premium to get to the head of the line. Other than being with my family, there was nothing pleasurable or memorable about my experience at Hurricane Harbor. As I said in the title, go to the beach instead.",BackPacker485814

50,family fun at any age,Would highly recommend this water park. Lots of things to do for any age. Large park with great rides for family or just yourself.,Teresa B
10,Awful. Avoid this place.,"I love water parks and have been to many in North America. This was the worst I have ever been to. Outrageously expensive. On top of nearly $40 ticket price, the parking costs $18. Small locker cost $14. We had to wait more than 30 minutes to buy obscenely overpriced food. The first ride shortly after the park opened was a short wait of about 10 minutes. After that nothing was shorter than 30-45 minutes. Don't plan to go on too many slides. Instead you'll be waiting in line. The stairs on some rides are uncovered and concrete. In 100+ deg heat they become like frying pans. My 8 year old niece burned her feet and got blisters. The Lazy River water was really gross. Looked like an unflushed toilet bowl. Won't be going back and suggest you stay away.",D M
50,Summertime slidin,Had a great time on my sons last day of summer vacation. The lines were no more than a half hour wait which gave us the opportunity to experience them all. The river float was relaxing after a busy day sliding.,Alexis B
10,Watch the rules and lack of customer service,Hurricane Harbor is an exception showing poor customer service such as:- my son had one small metal button on his shorts. We have visited many waterparks in the US and Europe and never had this problem.We were given no advice and had not seen this rule on the website before we bought the tickets. I asked a lifeguard for customer relations who were unbelievably unhelpful - would not lend me scissors despite them being between us in open view and provided no support. Thankfully the first aider is sensible and helped however this ruined an expensive pair of shorts.- there are no maps of the rides so you have no idea where or what to do- the use of queue managers to hold people at the bottom of the rides gives the false impression of shorter queues and the lack of indication of queue times does not help- the security guard on the bag check refused to allow us to bring in an unopened bag of Cheetos and a chocolate bar. When we had lunch other groups had brought picnics of food despite the rules- despite being next door to Six Flags the food was worse- there were long waits at the car park pay booths and no benefit to paying beforehand,NigelM1964
50,Amazing,"If your able to enjoy Hurricane Harbor first for a few hours, And then head over to Magic Mountain for a few more, Then you truly will have a Great over all experience.",Tonytigger06
50,Great family fun!,"My family decided to go to hurricane harbor for my sons birthday, we bought our tickets from my husbands work for only $24 (great deal). Since we didn't spend much on our tickets, I decided to buy the cabana, totally worth it for my family of eight. We got 20% off of everything and inner tubes for the family. The servers were really nice, although they did take a little while to get out drinks, but it was okay they were really nice. It was nice to have a spot of our own, with a table and chairs to accommodate all of us. We also decided to get the fast pass, definitely worth it, we got on the tornado about three times. My son and my family had a great time and plan to buy the season pass next time. Thanks hurricane harbor for making my sons birthday a great one!",mlss322
10,worst experience,Too expensive. Food was bad. Water was disgusting. No rides for smaller kids. Their 'flash pass' makes it impossible for everyone else to ride the water slides.waited in line for three hours to be told my child was less than half an inch to short. Rude employees. The list could go on... .We will not be going back!,Kristina R
50,Better than the beach!,"I have a 5-yr-old and a 7-yr-old. We live about 15 miles south of Hurricane Harbor and we have had season passes for three years now. This is the perfect place to head to on a hot summer day. Once you get through the parking and tram process (which isn't the best, but I'm not sure how it could be improved) you feel like you're in a resort. Nice, beachy music, beautiful landscaping and lots to do. You can take your time and float down the Lazy River or battle the waves in the wave pool. We tend to avoid the slides because of the 5 year old. She's not quite ready for that adventure, but she's never bored. The girls hate to leave, which, to me, says a lot about this place.",GeoThomason
40,Great Way to Spend a Hot Summer Day,"Hurricane Harbor is a great way to spend the hot summer days. This year's season pass cost less than 2 admissions so we bought season passes. As the parent, I mainly hung out under the trees reading a book. My kids LOVE HH. There are lots of slides to ride and some dare devil-ish ones, too. If you have little ones, there are shallow places to keep them busy and safe. Wednesdays and Fridays are really busy days there. Our last visit was a Tuesday and it was much less crowded. I suggest getting there early to find a nice place to plant your towels and such. Don't forget the sunscreen and I highly recommend water shoes.My only problems with HH are that it's so expensive to park, eat and use the lockers. Parking was $18 per car!!!! A chicken strips or hamburger with fries are $10 and they don't come with a drink... Lockers are $13, so if you want to keep your phone and wallet secure, you need to pay that, too. They allow you to bring in waters (I froze 2 per person and that was nice to have) and I've been lucky to have been able to sneak in snacks, but that's always risky. I've seen them confiscate outside food.",zoofamily
10,Absolutely horrible experience and poor value.,"The slides would probably be great if you could get on one in a reasonable time, we waited an hour and 45 min for one ride. The park greatly oversold their capacity so finding a spot to sit or even stand away from anyone or the smell or urine was next to impossible. Parking $18 and another $7-14 to rent a tube for lazy river... Worst water park visit ever. Go somewhere else, Soak City or Raging Waters are much better values.",Cheryl P
50,Awesome!!!,This park is really nice. It is large and has plenty to do. To get through the entire park you probably need to go twice!,Maryanne M
30,"Very expensive, crap food, kids had fun though","I am not a big fan of theme parks, but am happy to take the kids. Hurricane Harbor is a water park right next door to Magic Mountain, in Valencia, north of LA. we stayed in Santa Monica, it took about 45minutes and 10 years off my life to drive there, the driving style on the big highways is very fast and unpredictable, bearing in mind this was the end of a 3 week road trip in the US, we thought we had got used to the roads here...This water park is around $30 per person to get in, you have to pay $18 to park, or more for valet parking, then you need to arrive early to get a sunbed with shade, or pay $150 for a cabana, then if you and your kids don't want to queue for ages you can get a fast pass from $15 each, our sons felt this was really worthwhile as we visited on a very busy day. Lockers are $14 and up, and renting a rubber ring is $7 each. Your bags are searched on arrival and they will ask you to throw any food or drink away, as they insist you not bring any in. Weirdly my fruit salad and water was allowed in, the crisps in my husbands' pack were taken away. I wouldn't mind so much but e food was really junk, greasy and not very nice to eat, and drinks were very expensive ($3.50 and up) for water, soda etc cost more. My sons, 16 & 13 really enjoyed their day, my husband and I felt it was a bit over priced and that we have been to better water parks in Europe.",Samscram
20,Selling an over priced ticket,"They did not inform us that we had the option to buy the less expensive ticket, so a teenager spent all his money on the more expensive ticket with useless features and had no money left over for lunch. When we found out about the less expensive ticket, they would not change it for us, even though the booklet remained untouched.",Armaghan G
10,Waste of time and money...don't bother!,"First time wasn't enjoyable, so had to try it again. Terrible system of waiting in long lines with little shade protection for 1-2 hours or more for a minute ride. Dirty, overcrowded, run poorly by teenagers who do not take it seriously. We could not get family who live nearby to join us they did not enjoy the park either. Not worth the money and would not recommend. We did 6 theme parks in California on this trip and this was worst and least enjoyable along with 6 Flags Magic Mountain next door.",Mike B
50,My First Water Park Experience,"Hurricane Harbor made my first experience at a water park quite amazing. If you plan on visiting in the future, I suggest going on the ride, Tornado. That ride was the best ride in my opinion. It is a perfect, more on the wild side type of family ride. It is a 4 seater and intense, a good intense.",Selyna R
50,awesome place,"Really enjoyed our visit, lifejackets are a little scarce so bring your own if you have little ones under 48"" other than that, wear sunscreen and prepare to have a blast!!!",Crystal P
10,Waste of time and Money!!!,"This is the worst water park we have ever been to and we have been to many waterparks. Terrible system of waiting 20 mins for a 30 second ride. Water was freezing that we didn't even enjoy the pool at all. Dirty, overcrowded, few rides, run by uncaring teenagers, terrible cheap unhealthy food. Will NEVER return and would NEVER recommend it. Our 3 kids felt it was a waste of time and we had more fun in the hotel pool.",Happybbbb
10,DO NOT BUY A SEASON PASS!!,"I was misleaded by the ads, when you buy a Season Pass you don't get any goodies, specially the Book of COUPONS they promess.",Arte G
50,excellent,"This was a half day visit but very enjoyable. We spent a lot of time in the River swimming, playing and floating on our tube, but also enjoyed the water slides and wave pool. We will return for more family fun soon.",Michele K
40,Nothing like a lot of water when it really hot out,I've been to Hurricane Harbor many times and enjoy it every time. My only dislikes are the hot pavement; intermittent large umbrella would be nice be break up the long hot pavement areas and also the eating area is very hot unless you're lucky to get a breeze.,Cuauhtemoc C
40,Nice place to cool off during the summer!,"As a resident of Santa Clarita, I find the Hurricane Harbor is the place to hang out and cool off on days it's a million degrees outside. I visited this park for now 6 years and some have been great and some good trips. I know crowds are insane sometimes and say they aren't doing there job but think about this, would you send visitors in a tube one by one or send 3 people in a separate tube on the same slide and have someone get hurt? The staff is running the park right and I have two friends that work there now. Think about it folks! I think it's a great water park despite the cargo ship of people there, but that's summer time at Six Flags.",Taylor B
20,HORRIBLE LONG LINES!,The lines were so bad that we were there 4-5 hours and only got on 2 water slides! They need to put in more slides to accomodate teh crowds... I don't know why anyone bothers with the waterpark there.Six Flags Amusement Parks are awesome and while lines can be long at times there are still many rides that are not... And you are not in bare feet burning on the ground...,TLWasHere
10,How not to run a park...,"Don't staff appropriately, make it really hard to get money from your customers, make it even harder to buy food, then treat them poorly when they raise their concerns.We spent $800 on the flash pass (which was great) but it took 2 hours to get in, get our pass. BY then we were really hungry... another 2 hours to get food. Then the park closed 2 hours later. So much FUN. Save yourself the Agro and go to the beach.",Val B
10,Find Somewhere Else,"We arrived at the park at 11am and left at 7pm, during this time we were able to ride 3 slides, and also managed to have a brief 5 minuets in the wave pool. Over-crowded, unorganized and chaos. Would never return nor will I ever recommend anyone too.",canadiangurl92
50,Worth every dollar,We like going during the summer vacation because we first visit the water park then jump over to Magic mountain to finish off the day!!! Soo much fun!!!,Daniel B
50,best place to be on a hot day!,If you have kids trust me they will love this place just fun all around! The kids area is really nice the river and all the slides are safe and fun to be on.,Nat B
50,Amazing family day,"We have visited other water parks in California and so far this one has been the best fit for all the different ages in our family. Me (30), Hubby (34), daughter (10), son (6), son (6). This park blew me away. They had everything for everyone, and the area for my boys was just great. There are tons of slides in around the park, but the area for the kids that are my son's age was awesome, there was about 10 slides, that even adults can enjoy. The lifeguards were friendly and seemed happy to be there. We went on a weekday shortly after the park started operating daily and we were able to ride every slide we wanted in under 10 minutes. It was great, three people in our party were even able to ride the Tornado seven times! The park looks so small from the outside, but once you're in it's fairly large. It was clean and the employees were friendly and it made it an excellent day. Water park trips are something we do every summer and my kids look forward to it throughout the year. When we left the park all three of my kids said that this was the park they wanted to come to every summer from now on. I would highly recommend this park to families who have many different ages of people with them, and I would recommend going on a week day for sure. You can also purchase tickets through their website three days in advance for $30.00 (what a deal!). In comparison to other parks we have visited, this one is clearly well maintained. Definitely a must visit park, especially if you live in between Tulare and Los Angeles.",packyourheart
50,Hurricane Harbor - Lot of Fun,"We have season tickets and that is working out great! Consider arriving at the park early so you can select seating, as the good spots go fast. If you are going to bring a lunch be advised that there is a small grass lunch area in the parking lot. For best parking be there at least 1/2 hour earlier than the thrill park opens. If you bought a sports bottle this season, bring it back as refills are cheaper than regular drinks.",Charles B
50,Hurricane Harbor will Blow you away!!!!,Make sure to be fully rest and come well prepared to have fun. This park is filled with amusement for all ages. Be sure to stop by the gift shop and purchase one of the awesome items that are inexpensive and cool!,MyaMcMillon1
40,"Get the flash pass on crowded days, it is worth it.","We went here on one of the hottest days of the summer, 105 or something. I know crazy huh? So the park was expected to be about 7000 in attendance. As gold pass members we had an early entry into the park and had no problem getting chairs in the shade. The gold membership was worth it just for that but then to get a discount on the flash pass, what a bonus. The flash pass turned out to $10 per person with our season pass discount and it was so worth it!! We did not have to wait in lines and were able to ride the funnel looking ride called Tornado 3 times. You have to climb lots of stairs with a large raft but what fun ride! I liked this ride most of all. I know that others had to wait in line for hours that day but on crowded days it was so worth the extra 10 bucks. The lazy river was crowded & cloudy but we were in the water so much that I did not notice how hot the day was until we left the park.We brought water into the park and bought food. The food line was long and not as good as I hoped. Food was expensive too but when is it not at an amusement park? I hope that they add more places for guests to sit and lounge, as it appears more is needed. The staff was nice and helpful. I would not leave any valuables by your chair unless you plan on watching it all day, otherwise leave them at home or get a locker. As we were rarely out of the water I would recommend buying a waterproof wallet or something to carry your ID and credit cards.",A Pampered Traveler
40,Fun for the whole family!,"Kids have a blast every time we visit. Us moms also enjoy ourselves, there's plenty of fun for all ages. The only downfall is there are Never enough seats when we go. Its happened at least 4 times to us now. I think it's a problem. Sometimes it can be quite frustrating. I'm not sure how that can be controlled but hopefully they find a solution. Get there before it opens so that you can grab a spot!",AlexLisa02
30,Lazy River still the best,"Yes, the lines for some of the rides can be a drag. My best advice is to go in the middle of the week when it's not so crowded--I was recently there on a Thursday and our longest wait time for a slide was about 30 minutes.Downside is always having to pay for food. If you can, pack lunch stuff and leave it in the car, then get a stamp to be let back in so you can break for a quick lunch in the parking lot. Walking might seem like a pain, but it's better than forking over $20 a person for mediocre food and beverages.",Zantastic
10,Waste of time & Money,"2 slides in 5 hours makes for a wasted trip. Do not expect to complete the rides in one day unless you pay extra money for a flash pass. Pretty sad that those who can afford to pay extra money to play can and those who cannot get to sit and watch the others play. Be prepared for long waits, overpriced food, $14 for a small locker & tube rentals. You may need a season pass just to experience it all. The park itself was clean, lifeguards were slightly whistle happy & the employees interactions with guests needs improved. Based on our experience we will not be returning unless we are guaranteed a better experience personally by the management team to include a paid trip back!",MomofKS
10,Don't waste your day at hurricane haror,DO NOT RENT LUE TUBESService is poor overcrowdingNo mapsLines slow due to tube rental systemBetter water parks in southern cal knots soak city and San Dimas waterpark better run better ridesHurricane harbor experience doesn't parallel magic mountain park terrible water park,Jeff V
10,Waited over an hour to order food.,"I have a season pass to here and Disney. Obviously you can't compare service. I don't expect much.I get there when the park opens to get a spot for the day. I have the tube pass. I wait in lines.But really?? I got in line at 1:45, with about 6 people ahead of me. At 2:30 I called guest relations to complain. It was a Tuesday. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally advised to ask for a supervisor at the food place. I finally got to order at 2:55. Yes. seriously. The supervisor basically blew me off, and said they were busy. No duh. I guess waiting over an hour is acceptable to him. I could have driven to Disneyland or walked to Wendy's and back in that time.Tried to reserve a Cabana for this upcoming weekend. We have a large family coming in, and didn't want to have to fight for spots. Was told reservations can only be made online. What? Not while I'm standing here in your park? Oh, and you can't do it from an IPad, requires flash.In the lazy river two gang bangers were fighting, punching, and trying to knock each other off. All of this between life guards. The life guard advised me to tell the next one down the way.Can't bring any outside food in, and yet on all three occasions that I have been there this summer, there are always families all around me setting up little picnics. No one checks. No one cares. Disneyland allows food and snacks.Kids running around in their tighty whities. I kid you not. Bathing suits don't seem to be a requirement.I don't get it. A little management, a little care, and this place could be so much nicer. Their lack of effort shows.Last summer my father had his wallet and phone stolen from an employee. We got the run around for months. Finally gave up. Pathetic and sad.",Breely22
50,Amazing Day,"I couldn't have gone to this water park on a better day! My family of 10 including myself, had been wanting to visit Hurricane Harbor for more than 2 years now. Ever since 2006 my family & I take a trip here at least once a year. We've been 2010 was the last time we went. We had such an amazing time. And the weather was perfect being at 103 degrees out. Love coming here its like a mini vacay. Come and experience it for yourself. You wont be disappointed!",Chiikkxzme
10,Dont go,"filthy water, 4 inches of flooded dirty bathroom water, full of gang banger tattooed families, many obscenities, ride lines over an hour long and many closed. An hour wait for an innertube, and the wave pool kicking us out every 10 minutes and not letting you back in for another 10 minutes. Lazy River shoulder to shoulder with people and a near perfect drowning experience",Lisa F
10,Poor customer service is a understatement,"Too bad I cannot give 0 as a rating, but 1 is the minimum the system allows.When looking at the park in an overview type format it is just a park with extremely long lines, same water rides as everyone else.....but their one outstanding achievement is that I do not think I have been to a place with worse customer service.Long lines = riding 3 slides in 4 to 5 hours. Maybe they could run the rides a bit faster, limit the park to X amount of visitors {ones they could manage easier}, but the lines are terrible at the place.Customer service = piss poor attitudes of both the ride personnel and the food vendor personnel. I don't recall when I have been treated so badly by people I am PAYING to treat me better.",TCPDump
10,This place awful!,"Positive, lots of places in the shade to get a lounge chair.The park is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY!!!!!! our lounge chairs while in the shade were once white I think?????? They are nasty covered in grime. I'm just glade we brought lots of towels to cover them. We let our 13,12 and 9 year olds go in the wave pool and they came back within 5 minute scared because some teenagers tried to flip them off their tubes. Uh, where were the lifeguards?? We all stayed together after that. I found 1 restroom, used it several times and I was the only one in it................ Yuck! This is not a family place at all, teens with no supervision this place is scary!!",1955mickeyfans
10,"Long lines, stolen goods, poor customer service","We had things moved by other people, we were there for 4plus hours and got to go on 3 slides. The water was cold, people were rude, pushed Discover and Sports bottles. Sold us the unlimited sports bottle AND the refill bracelet on same day. When questioned, no one could help. Only to have the bottles stolen out of our stroller while waiting in line for slide.",Brad B
50,Great fun for the whole family,"We haven't been to Hurricane Harbor for many years, but our visit yesterday reminded me of what a good time we can all have together.

30,Ehh. Needs work,Was in the lazy river and saw a dirty used tampon near water.. was definitely grossed out.. little kids need to be set straight and follow rules.no rough playing horsing around. This is suppose to be a family park not somewhere where teenagers are practically half naked and down eachothers throats. Food is far to expensive . People are rude .. needs major improvement,aleesandrasMommy
50,Perfect family fun!,"Hurricane Harbor staff went out of their way to make our day perfect. Every single person whom we had contact with was polite, friendly, helpful and cheerful. The park is set up for families. We strongly recommend Valet Parking; you'll thank yourself at the end of a long day of fun.",Helen A
10,Customer Service is horrible,Employees are so rude and demeanoring. Also food for dining passes are small portions and poor quality.,Reina I
50,Great place for the whole family,Hurricane Harbor is a wonderful water park for all ages! We really enjoyed the family slide! Make sure to bring shoes & sunscreen!! My kids from 16-4 all had something to do. We had a great day and can't wait to come back!,RambleOnRainah
10,Won't go back,"Not a safe enviroment in my opinion. Gang banger tube stealing people everywhere! Dirty lazy river! Your gold pass from other six flags locations is not valid here!L ine cutters even with the flash pass, Go to raging waters!",cbear1cher
20,Dirty,"I always like to start a review with the good, then the bad, but I honestly cannot find anything good about this place.The parking lot is so vast that it can take up to almost 30 minutes to walk to the park depending on where you are exactly. If you have kids like us, with a double stroller and all the stuff don't bother attempting to get on the tram, you won't fit. The local Sheriff dept. has an off chute station there which will tell you the Element that visits Six Flags. You go through metal detectors to enter, once in you stand in line forever to get a locker if there are any left. Chances are you won't get seating either so bring a lawn chair. Then there is the filth, no I am not exaggerating, it is filthy! We are local and have had season passes to both parks for 3 years in a row. Here is what we have encountered: a tween girl with a poop in her pants walking along the kiddie pool, brown sauce running down her leg, the father helped get her out of her bathing suit threw the poop in the trash went to the pool to wash out her suit. Feces in the bathroom on the floor where someone couldn't quite make it, the facilities floors are black with mildew and dirt, I never use the shower there nor walk barefoot anywhere in the park. 2012 seemed especially disgusting and while the park is literally 10 minutes driving from my house, I will try to find another water park farther away hopefully cleaner. This park year after year does not make improvements or fix anything, it is cheap granted but I wouldn't mind spending more money to be able to use the restroom and swim in water that doesn't have trash floating in it. Food is pretty basic, expensive and not the best, but eatable. Here is one positive, the wave pool is usually pretty clean.",Trudy G
50,Water Park right next to Magic Mountain!,This Water Park is right close to Six Flags and is a pretty good water park. It's ideal to come in the summer then later at night (if you have a pass) you can go to Magic Mountain. :),Yhhjcxg
20,money money money,"This place charges you for everything and very expensive. People cannot even take a trip if they want and just enjoy time with family its sad. the food is way over priced and taste terrible, shame on who ever owns this park all they care about is them self. Selfish money takers hope you are all having a good life as we all struggle just to make a penny!",LISA A
40,fun family place,it is best to go during the week. It's worth taking the time off from work. In the weekends it gets super crowded and you can't really enjoy the rides.,famfavtravels
30,Nice HH Park,Pretty small park but I like it If you're going to visit both park MM&HH on weekend in one day might not good idea it' too crowded a lot of kids and teenager you will don't have much time to enjoy. Summertime in California it's really hot so entre in the morning will be probably good.,RiniRabbit
40,Good park for size,"On a weekend, don't bother, it is a small park and is claustrophobic. If you can get a weekday off for the family, it is a fun little park, it has all of the basic water park attractions, steep drop, floating river, wave pool, inner tube rides. There is a nice little grass shaded picnic area in the parking lot, if you can pack a cooler, it is a great for families, healthier, cheaper and same amount of time as standing in a food line.",Erik4Travel
20,MEH! At Best.,"Normally, I’m a Water Park Junky. However, this was the first time I found myself wanting to leave rather than stay. Instead of giving a huge disappointing review I will just leave a few tips for your visit.Tube Rentals:Several web sites tell you to rent the tubes when you go. Don’t!TUBE TIP – If you rent them they will be stolen. Yes, other people will “borrow” them while you are in the park. You will then have to stand in the rental line again for more. Most rides have lines for free tubes when/if you need them. Several rides require special tubes anyway. And again, you will have to leave your rental tubes on the side of the ride.Seating – Get there early. People will grab multiple seats almost immediately. You may want to inquire about a cabaña for the day if you have a larger group.Rides – Nothing out of the ordinary for a water park. The park has one extreme ride and a nice area for the kids. However, the lazy river was dirty and needs some attention in areas.Staff – Lacking in some key areas of customer service. Simple empathy or sympathy for visitors would be nice. Most are younger adults running the rides and taking tickets. Just think 18-20 and “I feel entitled”.Bathrooms - Worst Part of the park. They were crowded, cramped and un-sanitary. No room to change or even keep dry. No privacy or areas to get ready or dry off to leave. I hope you don't have to go!Food – Eat before you go. And, after you leave. Get a snack at best. Like to share? Purchase a refillable drink “souvenir” cup. However, be prepared to wait in line. Yes, it’s a theme park.Parking – Hopefully, if you are staying in a nearby Hotel? You can get a ride from the hotel shuttle. If not? Be prepared to shell out some cash to park. A free parking pass is included with an “annual pass”. No, we don’t live in the area and will probably not visit again. It was just less expensive to park and park hop.Entry/Park Hopping – This seems like it would be easy. NOPE. You have to exit the park and then go through the security checkpoint again. Not easy if you have a family or extra stuff with you. Pack light and bring only necessary items with you. Lockers are expensive.Overall, our experience at the Water Park was less than good. Thinking of visiting Six Flags Hurricane Harbor? Go to with what they are know for best... Roller Coasters.",nottabox
30,Nasty bathroom facilities,"I disliked the bathroom facilities, yet, the frightfest themes were awesome. The park was overly crowded during frightfest, so since the whole park had something to offer without visiting all of the mazes, that helped keep us interested through the night",stokeslp3
30,Summer Season Pass,"We had the Season Pass this year and had a fairly good time. We did encounter that the lazy pool was very dirty. We often had trash hit us in our face and other nasty materials in the water that I would rather not mention in detail. The lines to get refills or food in general, were horrible. We waited once 1 hour and 10 minutes to order pizza and another 25 to get our order. We opted to eat before getting there and grabbing a snack on our way home. I will not be purchasing a season pass next year. The locker rental fees are really expensive and it is hard to access your locker when you have a lot people doing the same. I might visit once, but would rather go to magic mountain instead.",Esther Cruz Sosa
40,A nice way to cool off,"Not having to drive through Downtown LA if you are coming from the north (which is most of the state{area wise}) to get to the park is nice. It had all the typical water park type rides and slides. Most importantly for me was that the times I went they were less crowded and cheaper then some of the biggest competitors. The biggest problem I had with them (other then the price) was that they were mostly water slides. They had the wave pool and lazy river, but they need some log or white water type rides. Some of us don't care for the water slides.",socaltrekkie
40,Fun place for all ages,"We went to Hurricane Harbor for the first time yesterday. It was a fun experience for my kids and I (6 and 4). They are having a special discount, buy one day and get the whole 2013 for free including Magic Mountain and parking! Great deal. The only complain I have is that the staff members gave me different/ wrong information. I asked 3 different staff members what time the park closes, each member gave me different answer and all of them are wrong.",goodtobargain
30,"Fun, but needs major upgrades.",This place is fun but I found the entire area very dirty and not well kept up. The little kids area bothered me particularly because the pads at the ends of the slides were torn up and not in good shape. Same with the slides in other areas. The food lines were ridiculously long and after coming here for years they have done nothing to change that situation. i only come here if I have to. i wish they would invest a little money and bring it back up to speed.,yellowsunfish61
30,Fun but too crowded!,Maybe I was a bit too old to enjoy this place. Most of the time I 'fraid about the water hygiene when I was in the beach pool area. I felt like there were too many people packed in the pool barely any place to move around. But overall my friends and I had great fun that day.,Hanley L
40,Above-average water park with shorter hours,"As water parks go, if you are going to visit Six Flags more than once a Summer, get the Season pass for both the rides and the water park. This place is better for pre-teens and smaller kids than the thrill ride park. But, IT GETS CROWDED. Arrive early, stake your spot (maybe even upgrade to a tented area, and camp all day. It's not good for short visits. As with the ride park, the food is pricey and not healthy. Sneak something in or eat wisely (and early). Generally, though, and excellent day of fun for most kids and groups.",AHSwift
40,Blown away at Hurricane Harbor,"Hurricane Harbor is a family theme park that brings the kid out of all ages. Pricing was reasonable and the wait times to get on rides wasn't too bad, but was great once we bought $20.00 Flash Bracelet(5.00 refund for returning the pass bracelet). We enjoyed some great rides that lived up to their reputation of ""heart stopping"". A few of them actually imitated my Son who fears no ride. The food was average and the lines were long (especially because most people were just running up top let friends and family members or for them once they made it near the front of the line. Security and cleaniness of this park was phenominal, there was a sense of pride in maintaining this attractive and relaxing theme park. I look forward to visiting Hurricane Harbor again.",Gary_schoolfield@yahoo.com
20,Never again!,"We are big fans of waterparks, but this place was a big disappointment. I had read several reviews about how bad this place was. We had received free season passes for Hurricane Harbor when we bought our Magic Mountain passes. So we thought we would see for ourselves. We got there shortly after it opened, and found ourselves struggling to find a chair to park our things. After thirty minutes we were able to locate three chairs for the four of us. Mind you, they were in the hot sun since shade is nearly nonexistent here. The park was packed with hour long lines just 45 minutes after opening. We were at a loss as to why a significant number of slides and attractions were still closed an hour after opening. When we asked, a staffer told us they were short on lifeguards. Seriously??? In the dead heat of summer??? Mind you, this place is small, with a limited number of slides already. To cope with the 100 degree day, we let our kids play in the pool area near the front of the park. My husband wanted a snack, and bought us a veggie tray. The celery was so soggy it was inedible, and the carrot were spotted with mildew. He took it back and got some grapes. Eventually we headed out to try the slides again. The wait times were down to 40 minutes, still tough in the heat. At one point, we split up and my husband to our 7 year old to play in the kid area. While he was there a child threw up on the shore of the area. The red vomit slowly sliding in to the water. The lifeguards made no attempt to clear the pool. They just stood around it. I find this odd since Raging Water clears pools everytime, and Hurricane Harbor has hygine signs all over the place reccommending you stay out of the water if you have had a stomach illness recently. Hmmm? All the reviews had said the lazy river water was super gross. I'll admit, it was strewn with plant debris, but I didn't find it as teribble as i had read. Although, it was VERY crowded. Later we decided to brave the VERY long lines for food. Over $60 later, we had a tasteless, greasy pile of burgers and fries. I am a vegetarian and was limited to an expensive box of lettuce with grape tomoatoes. I headed over to the Tradewinds snack stand for a fruit platter. Part way in to this $7.50 box, I found my cantalope rinds covered in mold. I took it back, to have the supervisor tell me it was fine, but he would refund my money anyway. Nice! The rest of the day stayed about the same level of frustration. One of our chairs was taken from us while were were picking up food. Our towels just thrown aside. As mad as I was, I understand why since there is a shortage of chairs for the number of guests. The guests. Oh the guests. There are some colorful individuals. Tattoos are abundant, but the problem I had was with the language and behavior. Cursing and groping and reeking of marijuana. Not exactly the kind of place I want to bring my kids. Some of them arguing with the staff when they were told they couldn't ride a slide in their jeans and bras. Duh! Many have spoken of the bees. Yes, they are everywhere. But if you keep snacks and soda away from where you are, you will be fine. Mostly. All in all, we were deeply disappointed. The kids seemed to enjoy themselves, but I will never go back.",tikijo
10,The worst waterpark in America,This place is poorly managed and the staff is as angry as you are. Waits are long while 1/2 the rides sit dry. Just dont go.,oldensign
10,disgusting and vile conditions,"Went to hurricane HArbor-total rip off. Do not rent cabana. in hot sun. Tons of bees. Filthy with cigarette buts all over. My children found feces on two of the stairwells leading up to rides. They should be ashamed of themselves. Don't know how health department hasn't shut them down. Water dirty. Common areas have puddles of stagnant water. Food lines one hour wait. Overcrowded. They conditions are horrible. Old, bathrooms flooded and gross. Trams old and no shade when buying tickets. MAgic Mountain you should be ashamed!!!! I called to complain and they hung up on me. I will be fighting all charges with my credit card. Sending complaint to channel 7 as well. Really gross place.",alanaNAhmias
20,Not what you want for your childrens first water park experience,"Last Thursday (8/9/12) I took my 2 daughters and 2 of their friends to Hurricane Harbor for the day. It was our first time to visit this park, and a first time for my girls to visit any water park.Thank goodness I read the reviews for this park prior to going, so I had some insight of what to expect. Having so many negative reviews, I tried to figure ways to combat customer complaints so we could have the most enjoyable experience possible.The majority of complaints for this park are as follows: 1) Expense; 2) Overcrowding;3) Inadequate resting areas; 4) Lines too long; 5) Dirty water/unkept grounds; 6) Poor service/long wait for food; 7) Bee infestation.We decided to give this park a try as we have season passes to Six Flags Magic Mountain and admission to this park is free for us. We were hoping this would help keep the expenses lower.Another way we tried to keep the expenses lower was to purchase 3 refillable souvenir cups for $30.00 ($9.99 each) as opposed to $14.99 each if purchased separately.To combat not having a shaded resting place, and waiting in long lines for food we rented a cabana. Cabana rental was an expensive $150.00, but it did come with 4 tubes worth $20.00 in tube rental savings, and a large locker the park normally charges $18.00 for.Purchasing Flash Passes for $10.00 each allowed us to spend time in the wave pool, lazy river, or other smaller pool areas instead of waiting in long lines for rides. The shortest line was 45 minutes, and the longest was 2 hours 10 minutes. Due to the extreme 111 temperature the lines were too long, so buying the Flash Pass is what you need to do if you want to avoid dying of heat stroke while waiting in line to ride a water ride.The park is infested with bees, and it'a a serious infestation as the park refuses to spray since some environmental wacko has determined bees to be endangered. I live in a rural farming community with my house being surrounded by fields. There is an issue of bee die off with agricultural/farming bees due to crop dusting insecticides near the bee boxes. However, these bees are considered ""disposable"" as pollinating crops are their only purpose -- not making honey. Bees are NOT endangered, anyone visiting Hurricane Harbor can testify to that. Please see the photo of bees on our table. If you're allergic to bees you should avoid this park!Unfortunately the park does not seem to be compliant with health code standards as the water in the lazy river and some smaller pools brown brown.Staff was friendly and helpful. I have no complaints about the staff as they were all doing their jobs to the best of their ability. The owners however need to place a limit on how many guests can enter the park to avoid overcrowding, long lines, etc. Unfortunately, I think this park is all about money -- pure greed -- once they have your money they don't care if you have a good time.At the end of the day I spent spent $304.00 for cabana rental, Flash Passes, food/drinks. Please keep in mind I did not have to pay admission or parking, which would be additional for people who do not have season passes. One word sums up this park: GREED.I doubt we will return to Hurricane Harbor because there are too many nice parks to visit instead.Note to County Health Department: If thiws park passes health code requirements I'd suspect someone is accepting money illegally to give the park passing grades. While on a Mexican cruise a few years ago we visited a water park in Puerto Vallarta to swim with dolphins. We thought the water looked a little dirty so we did not allow our children to ride the water slides.Six Flags Hurrican Harbor is even worse than an old run-down park in Mexico.",AprilC73
10,Worst Day EVER!!!,"Too expensive 2 get in & once ur in, u have 2 rent rafts 4 slides, they dont let u bring ur lunch in cuz they want u 2 buy their over the top priced food!!

30,No big deal,No big deal. Somewhat fun. Extremely pricy especially food and drinks. Can get very hot in the summer. Need lots of sunscreen or burn! Grounds not very well kept. Lot of trash strewn around.,Timeseeker
30,"A good place for locals to cool off, but I wouldn't recommend for tourists","I have been here several times because I live near it and we have annual passes to Six Flags. My kids are younger and we don't spend a lot of time on the water slides and mostly just in the water play areas, pools and lazy river. Although my kids do enjoy it, it's not super clean and it can get really crowded on summer week days when summer camps and school groups are visiting. I've waiting over 45 minutes before to order food. Their process behind the food counter needs a total revamp. Plenty of employees back there but the lines move super slow.You do have to pay for intertubes, but life jackets for kids are free. I would also recommend not bringing any valuables in (cell phone, wallet, etc.) so you don't need to rent a locker. At Guest Relations, you can buy a money wristband that can be scanned at any food or merchandise location. I always bring $50-100 on cash, apply towards the wristband, use it throughout the day and the get the amount refunded at the end of the day. It's much easier than worrying about your money. i would also suggest getting there early to get a good ""spot"" for your stuff.I think it's great for locals, but if you're visiting LA, there are plenty of other places to see. If you want to cool off and enjoy the water, drive out to the beach instead.",Gahan
10,Never again!,"We visted in July as part of our Six Flags season pass, and wish we hadn't.The waterpark was packed. People were plopping their things down everywhere because all the chairs and tables were taken. We rented a cabana for $150 and all we got was 4 tubes, a VERY dirty scummy table, 4 sandy muddy lawn chairs, and a nice view of trash behind the cabana. Total rip off!The wait for the slides were all 45+ long, but oddly enough there were no lines for the bathroom. GROSS!All the buildings were in disprepair, and I suprized they could even pass fire code/health inspections.We stayed for two hours and left. Will never return. Total waste of money.",CanyonGirly
10,Overpriced and overcrowded. Waste of a day,The park is dear to get into and I spent about 5 hours there and struggled to get onto slides. Think I managed 4 max. The ques were massive and slides were poorly organised by staff. Flys and wasps everywhere. I wasted a day here and would not advise anybody to here. Waste of a day.,Centre p
20,"Ok, but don't expect a lot - except for bees!","Our kids REALLY wanted to go to Hurricane Harbor this year, so we decided to go. Having only been there one other time 2 years ago, we thought we knew what to expect. As it turned out, we were wrong.We decided to go on a Monday. The park opens at 10:30 a.m. We arrived at 11:00. We walked around a bit to find lounge chairs in a shady spot. All were taken except for some in the only muddy area in the park. It was gross, as there were several spots in the mud and water where it was GREEN from algae! Just shows how long it's been since someone had cleaned that area. Nevertheless, since we had to have shade and figured we weren't going to be using the lounge chairs much anyway, we made the best of it.Every ride and slide there, with the exception of the lazy river and the kids areas, required one to climb MANY flights of stairs and wait between 30-90 minutes to ride or slide down. Summertime in Southern California can get pretty hot and NOWHERE in the park were there fans or misters for those willing to brave the heat and climb to the top of these staircases. Many people did it though.Eating areas were small and unless you were willing to eat at off-hours, there's very little seating to enjoy your meal. And again, there were no fans or misters in these areas so even though there were spots of shade, you practically melted along with the ice in your drink.The employees working at Hurricane Harbor, from those working the ticket booths to serving food must have been crazy from the heat as every one of them seemed to be moving in slow motion. We noticed this to be especially irritating as we were melting - again - while waiting over 40 minutes in line to order a single pizza. As my husband put it, ""They just had no sense of urgency"".Not only was the heat bad in the eating areas, but the number of bees was unbelievable! We were forced to move our things to another table (in the sun this time because there was no other place to sit) because were were being attacked by bees. We finally left some soda in a cup in a corner of the eating area and thankfully, the bees moved over there. It was awful.Our kids were disappointed in how long it took the lifeguards to give the ""OK"" to send the next person down the slides, as it was always between 3-4 1/2 minutes. We couldn't figure out why this was happening. It was a ridiculously long time to wait between each slider. Everyone waiting in the lines were more than a little irritated.The wave pool was nice, but there's a sign right as you walk in saying they close the pool for 15 minutes EACH HOUR for safety. Never seen that before at any other water park. Wonder what happened . . .And last, it was an expensive day. Parking was $17, lockers were $15-$17 depending on size, and food was expensive, too.All in all, the kids liked the rides, but not the waits. The adults would have liked to go someplace else altogether.",J O
40,Fun time,"Very fun and thrilling and refreshing, just very long lines. I spent about 3 hours on 7/18 and rode everything I wanted to just waited a lot.",Brad755
10,Hour long lines. Hidden extra costs. Dirty.,"Parking for $17, family locker same again and if you want a tube it is an extra $7 per person. Food very expensive and eating area absolutely overrun with wasps. I mean infested with wasps. Putting all of this aside, the worst thing was that each ride had lines that lasted an hour. My kids managed on 2 and gave up and stayed at the junior rides. Lines get fast passed by those with own tubes but even a line that had no tube to take was still an hour. River was filthy and both it and the waves were torture due to vast amounts of people floating in tubes shoving you under them. My 10 year old went under so many tubes that she was frightened to go back in the water.The ONLY positive that I can give is that the young kids bit was good even if my kids were too old for it.Go somewhere else. Utter waste of a huge amount of cash.",Lizzyanna
10,Too many routines,"There are too many routines to ""ensure"" that no accidents happened. So there where 24 people in front of us in the line, and it took 2 hours and 13 minutes! They also emptied the pool one to two times each hour.",JohnSV
40,"Water slides great, organization leaves something to be desired","After paying our $30 on-line advance ticket, we were not expecting to have to pay another $7 for tube rental, $15 for a fast pass (although this was WELL worth it - no waiting in line, more sliding time), and not allowed to bring any food in the park (except fruit) so dish out more $ for that. On top of that, there are no maps of the park, so it took us a good hour to get oriented and find out where all the slides were, and which ones needed tubes,...etc...Once we ""found our way around"", the park itself is lots of fun and has something for all ages (the kiddie park in the center is all free and no lines). The Tornado is the best slide!",fK8b0c6m
20,Disappointing,"After stopping at six flags discovery kingdom the day before this stop, this turned out to be a disappointment.

We reserved a cabana they said was for ten people, but we fit 18 just fine. They decorated it with balloons and a birthday banner. We received 4 free tubes food to feed 10 kids, sodas, and a birthday basket full of snacks and goodies for 10 kids. We had cabana service to get anything we needed and they checked on us every half hour. Some of the lines were long later in the day, but we got there early. The only negative was the restrooms. All in all it was a great experience.",Autumn Jason W
50,Absolutely Fine & Fun,"I was worried about going to this water park because some of the reviews are not so good.We got free passes to Hurricane Harbor for buying the Magic Mountain pass and thought we'd give it a try. I was absolutely fine! I'm glad we went. We had a great time. The park is clean, it's run well. The slides were fun. We spent the entire day there. There were no issues. The food is fine, it's theme park food. All in all, it's fine. There were complaints about the water being cold, we were okay because it was a warm day. No issue there.It's a million times better than that gross Knott's water park in San Diego. We will be going back to Hurricane Harbor this summer.",mendoza830
10,"DON'T BOTHER, RIDICULOUSLY OVER CROWDED.","The nightmare began with the 1) Ridiculous wait for the tram in the HOT sun. When I later inquired, we learned that on a Saturday, only 2 trams were operational. Since we were not aware of this, we continued to wait for over 35 minutes, while FULL and EMPTY trams passed the multitude of awaiting guests without as much as a suggestion that walking to the park would be an option. 2) Our first attempt at a ride, Black Snake Summit. Here, we stood in line for 45 minutes, without as much as moving one foot. According to the employee, the line above had not moved for quite some time, and we were told all rides had about the same wait time. So, after 45 minutes and no closer to the finish line, we decided to try something else. As informed, lines were ridicuously long everywhere, and we ended up watching our children play all day at the opened water playground in the center of the park and the wave pool. Never once did any of us enjoy one single ride. 3) The River Cruise water looked dirty. 4) Food lines were approximately 30 minutes in the sun, and we opted for a burger shack with a small bag of chips. Price? 4 tasteless burgers, 3 snack size potato chips and 1 refillable drink came to over $50.00! 5) Getting a refill on that $15 soda: you MUST get back in that 30 minute line to get your refill. 6) You don't want to know about the restrooms!!!! We will NEVER again return to Hurricane Harbor at Six Flags Valencia, CA.",LillyLilly2011
30,Another fun playground for my young kids,"My kids have fun at the water park because they love water. The water is cold, but you get used to it. They like to hangout at Castaway Cove and then move on to the wave pool and the lazy river. I can be a germophobic, but I suck it up and let my kids be kids. I'm on them about not gulping any water and sanitize their hands before eating. A fun place for playdates too. Our HH passes were free because we bought our Six Flags Magic Mountain family passes together at the beginning of the year. The kids working at the park are nice too.

20,"Long Waits, Few Slides","Hurricane Harbor is overpriced for what you get--few water slides and long, long waits.Whatever you pay online (cheaper than what you pay at the park), it's not worth it unless you fork out an extra $10 to not wait in line. The online tickets are about $28 if you buy 3 days in advance, but if you don't pay the extra $10, you'll stand for ages...and ages...and ages while you watch other people run up the stairs. It's a nasty system for milking people. And, you''ll end up spending half your visit day in line if you want to go on slides for the day...if you're there to just hang out and swim, then I guess it'll be fine.Parking is also $15, and if you happen to have a couple of grommets on your swim trunks (mine were on the side of my swim shorts on a pocket), they'll make you go buy a whole new swim suit in order to go on the body slides. This rule was not clearly stated on the web site. They also said I could wear ""water socks"" on the slides when I bought them at the park store, but they made me take them off for every slide.It's really a park for young kids...I saw tons of attractions for the little ones...as well as people who want to spend a lot of their visit just lounging in water.The teen/adult body slides are fun...but few.",Rosalind H
40,Good 1st Step,"My first visit to Hurricane Harbor. I was expecting it to be as big as Six Flags in L.A. (at least it looked that way on H.H.'s website). It was tremendously smaller, however my children enjoyed it! Since my kids have never been to Six Flags, this was a good baby step for them. Now they know what to expect when we go to Six Flags in LA! (It will just be bigger).",ratt29
30,"If you are a penguin, you'll love the FREEZING WATER","As a notorious fan of Disney parks as I am, this was my first visit to a Six Flags park and I immediatelly noted the company positions its product towards a lower income clientele: to start the admission ticket prices are less than half what you would pay at Disney/Universal parks. Six Flags at Valencia/Santa Clarita greets all visitors with a metal detector at entrance and performs 100% screening similar to TSA at an airport, which implies they are dealing with dangerous visitors (possibly gang members). They are clearly looking for guns or weapons during their search. Disney performs a much less intrusive search with no metal detectors. The facilities at Six Flags has less attention to details, they focus on a park that delivers functional fun at low cost. As a result, staff does not perform as ""cast members"" rathen they just behave like average employees at a fast food restaurant with minimal training. The only restaurat at the water park offered average ""theme park food"" (overpriced greasy burgers/fries/chicken) and besides you had to wait 20 minutes in line for food around lunch time with kitchen staff that looked clueless what they were doing, and the 20-year old manager looked visibly concerned. The slides were nice, but as many people noted average wait for thrill rides was 45 minute. WATER TEMPERATURE WAS FREEZING, as cold as the pacific ocean in California!!! The park does not heat water (possibly to save on utilility bill) and the park does not seem to care. Actually the average guest does not seem to bother and I have the feeling they are rather more concerned about paying a cheap ticket than getting upgraded services (such as heated water) because the park was full. In general I'd pay $5-10 more on my ticket for heater water, as my little daughter could barelly enjoy the cold pools and I caught a cold the day after. The facility is nice, they had a nice caribbean band playing music that made you feel like far away. But I'm not sure I'd return to this park again before trying another option (Soak City?).

30,Hurricane Harbor is a great water park but a bit pricey for what you get.,"A fun place however, more staff needed to avoid long waits in line. We arrived when it opened and though the lines didn't look long, there was a long wait. Maybe because school had already started for many and they didn't anticpate crowds? Or many of their employees had gone back to school? Anyway, we spent most of our time in line or at Splash Island, which is a blast. It's not a ride, just an area with small slides, and running around. The lazy river is a nice attraction, but it definitely needs repairs in some sections or better maintenance. Also, it would be nice if inner tubes were included. All in all, we had a fun time, just a bit pricey for what we experienced.",goodlifeCalifornia

I paid $15 to park there, there is security, this is supposed to be a family place. After placing police reports we all learned that Magic Mountain would assume NO liability and we were on our own.

There is unlimited access so use them frequently. Share with a friend or family member, but only if you plan on leaving at the same time. Food is outrageously priced. They have a picinic area out by the parking. Pack a cooler, leave it in the car, and ride the tram out for a lunch break. Make sure you get your hand stamped for re-entry. Tube rentals are $7 each. Take turns and share with family and firends. Life jackets are free for weak and small swimmers. Parking is $15 so car pool. Overall it is a fun spot and great for little children.",Jared T

40,"Lots of fun, but costly","We had a great time on our visit, with my husband and 2 sons, ages 9 and 11. We went on a Wednesday, and I highly recommend a midweek visit, to keep the wait times to a minimum, and try to arrive at opening time. We loved the variety of rides, and we were busy having fun all day with the slides, play structures, wave pool and lazy river. We brought our own water, which helped with the cost of food. My only complaint is the number of extra costs. The entry tickets were only the beginning - after the food, tube rental and locker rental, it turned into quite a costly day of fun! But as we left, we felt we got our money's worth from an awesome day.",vaykayfam
30,Long way outside LA and very busy,"We opted for the Six Flags Hurricane Harbor over the Knots Farm Soak City as we were located in North Hollywood. Even so the drive to Santa Clarita was quite long. We got there before opening which I would advise everyone to do. Book online or look for vouchers in your hotel or elsewhere.Do not fall for the salesperson selling refill cups outside the gates as they are cheaper once you are inside.Some of the water slides are very average but some are great (if only I could remember what they were called !) - the big black one, the big white one and some very fast shorter blue ones. Go on these as soon as you can because by about 1pm however the place is heaving and you can wait 45 minutes for the popular slides.Food was expensive and fairly average but that is pretty typical of these places.",SimonB61
10,"Ordinary rides, nothing special, ridiculous prices","This is one of the lamest excuses for a water park I have ever seen. I can't say a good thing about it. There is no ride worth doing that you couldn't see or do at another, more reasonable park. Not only is the price rather high to get in, but it is $7 to rent a tube you need to carry with you all day. The lazy river is extremely dirty, and the park altogether is not clean and not well-maintained. Please do not waste your time and money at this park, as you will probably regret it later.",BenjaminOdom
40,A fun day but short of staff,"A really fun day. We went midweek in August and the lines were reasonable for the rides. They could have been made even quicker if the park staffed to be busy. This was a real problem when trying to get lunch. Middle of the holidays and only half the windows open! It would seem that all the negativity toward here comes from being short of staff, if only management would realize that to make money you have to invest in people to take it in the first place. All in all the family had a great day and felt safe with plenty of lifeguards around. The children asked ""when can we come back"", so what more can you ask from a family day out?",MrB1966
10,too crowded,"simply worst place to take your kidsyou can't take any snack(they made me go back in the back of long line to eat my banana outside the park) ...$4 for a water bottle is a joke.lines are too long 45 min to one hour,not enough tubes so you have to rent one .but some rides need tube some dont so you are forced to carry the huge tube with you from one ride to otherlazy river get murky after 1pm you figure it out..",ohmymy
40,A Fun Way To Cool Off With Your Family,"This was probably the best thing I could have ever done with my family.Hurricane Harbor has a lot of fun water rides to beat the summer heat.If you have any type of bag,purse etc. you can store it in a locker for about $12.00.I also must tell you that some of the rides require an inner tube that you can rent in the area near The Forgotton Wave Pool for another $7.00.If you ever plan a trip to this facility try to go on a weekday when it's not too crowded.If you do most wait ride times will be in a 10-20 minute wait. If you only have a few hours I would recommend to ride Bamboo Racer,Black Snake Summit (the one that requires inner tubes),Tornado,Lightning Falls,and The One and Only River Criuse.When we were waitng in line to order lunch at Pirate Pavillion there was a lot of mysterious stainson the ground and and a disgusting odor that reeked of vomit.For this reason I am giving it only Four Stars.Besides this Hurricane Harbor is a really fun place to be with your family!",Aquarius21433
10,A Fun Day Quickly Turned to the Worest and Scariest Day of My Life,"The day my boyfried and I choose to go to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor was 3 days before my college classes started up. Make a long story short. We went down a water slide that was a tube slide and you had to have an inter tube to go down the slide. The life guard kicked my inter tube to get it going, and I tried to tell him that the handles didn't feel right before he kicked it down the water slide. After the first trun the inter tube went up alittle ways on the side wall is it normally does, but this time right handle broke causing my right arm go forwards, and it caused the inter tube to flip as it came down. My head and shoulder hit the slide as my body flipped over me and hitting the slide. After I got untwisted the water hit me causing me to fly down the waterslide without an inter tube. My head and body was being slamed back and forth against the slide and at every turn my speed picked up. Finaly I reached the end of the slide. The life gaurd came over to help. I was rushed to the hospital. I was luckey to not have any broken bones. As a result of this accident, I had 15 nots on top of my head, bruised face, brusied stomach, and still today I have sever back pain, right shoulder blade pain, and hip pain. Six flags Hurricane Harbor should paid for the hell I gone through and still going through, but they said its not their fault and they will not pay anything. How is it not their fault when one of their inter tube handles broke? I had to change my whole life around because of this Theme Park. My life has forever changed, and I do not want nobody else to go through the hell I gone and still going through. So if you still want to attend this water park, Do Not Trust their Equipment, Check Them Youself. My word of advice would be ""Stay Alive Don't Go To This Water Park."".",babygrl_in_Ca
20,Not a good experience,"My friends and I did the VIP package which included both the amusement park and the Water Park. As part of the package we got a cabana. There were a couple of issues. First of all we had reserved the cabana but for some reason our cabana was given to someone else. It took about 45 minutes before we got the cabana. The cabana was not cleaned before we arrived. There was litter on the ground, the table, chairs and loungers were not wiped down. The ""service"" you get is pretty lackluster at best. I was hesitant to get into the water rides. The water looked murky. It was a complete different experience from the amusement side of the park.",ajfd
10,Former rabid fan family will never return.,"We waited in to get a life jacket for my youngest, required for kids under 48"" in the wave pool. The boy who helped us (name withheld) told us ""I will help you down here"" and headed down to the other end of the counter. When he got there he handed OUR jacket to someone who had just arrived. He obviously hadn't even bothered to look at us. Guess what? It was the last jacket! Yes, they ran out of lifesaving devices for small children at 1:30 in the afternoon. They had plenty for adults, not surprising in a park where any water anywhere isn't deep enough to drown a sober adult. When I complained he said ""they were in line first."" I said they were not. The family behind me agreed and he muttered, ""Well, sorry. You can wait back there to see if someone returns one."" He then just walked off. As we waited (with my kids crying) I counted 17 other parents getting told there were no life jackets! We finally gave up, deeply disappointed that our favorite place is now such a dump. There were also too few mats on the big slide and inadequate tubes on other rides, needlessly lengthening the waits. We have been sometime season pass holders and have celebrated my older daughter's birthday here the last 7 of her 9 years. We will never come back. The overall uncaring attitude of the staff, the general mess, the primitive dressing room, the insufficient preparation for crowds all speak of a company that really doesn't care about its customers or its staff. Worst of all, my kids felt betrayed. Is this what they mean when they chirp, ""Have a Six Flags Day?""",Picklesthecat
20,Worst Ever,"We have been to water parks all over the usa and this ranks as the worst. We attempted to book a group rate on-line and had no luck, when trying to book as 12 singles it got worse. The park was slow!! is the best way to describe it. They were staffed to accomodate 5 thousand but allowed 10 times that amount in. We waited for one family ride for 1 hour and 30 minutes, after haft our group gave up and walked down before our 30 seconds of fun. It lacked direction signs and just general information. We always pack a picnic lunch but were not sure before arriving if there was areas available to eat or if we would be able to leave and re-enter. The tram from the parking lot does not run enough to accomodate the crowd (if you during the week, plan on hundreds of day care kids)",bagladygee
10,The Worst Water Park I Have Been To,"Let me start off by saying that my family and I usually go to about three water parks in different cities every year. This is the first one that when we left we actually said that we would never be back.My children are 2 1/2 and 11 so I will start with the slides for the 2 1/2 year old. There are two play areas for young children. The first area is intended for the smallest children. This area would be very nice with the exception of a couple of things. The first thing is that there are these cannons up above the area where people can shoot water both at you and your child as they are coming down the slide. Now keep in mind that these slides are intended for very young non swimmers. As my son was coming down the slide he was getting hit in the face by water making it hard for him to even breathe and then at the bottom, the shooters would turn the cannon and am their shots at your face! (Not to mention some of the shooters are even adults!) This is a young kids area for goodness sakes! Not fun when you are trying to enjoy the park with your child. The next thing in the area is this jungle gym type thing that has small slides coming down the sides. This would be OK except that there is so much water spraying down the jungle gym that the young kids can't even get up to the slides. (My 11 year old had a hard time as you have to hold your breath for about 20 seconds to make it up). It was very nerve racking when my 2 1/2 year old would go up and then gasp for breath at the top.The next kids area I would describe for a little older kids and has one long slow slide. This would not be too bad except for two things. Teenagers are aloud to come in the area and the use the crawl space as a slip n slide and they slam the little kids into the walls. Also, on the stairs, there is a hose type thing that comes from the ground and another one that comes from above on the top of the ship. Kids wait at the buttons for people to walk up and then spray you and your kids in the face on the steps. I actually fell down the steps because I couldn't see where I was going! Of course the kids that made me fall thought it was great fun but in their defense, it was the park that thought it was a good idea to pummel people in the face with water as they are going up and down stairs. Today I can barely move my back and my foot is very swollen (not fun!)Both of these areas as well as the lazy river are very cold. Both of my kids were blue and shaking while in these pools. I don't know how they keep the water so cold but the wave pool and the regular pool are not as cold as these areas.Now on to the older kids rides. My 11 year old brought a friend and went on some of these rides but quickly tired of them since there was 30-45 minute waits for all of these rides. (This was on a Monday). The lifeguards that they have running the slides have no intention of trying to make the line go faster. They are obviously there to put in their time and collect their paycheck. In fact one of the guards even said to me ""there is no way that I can control these kids."" That was amazing since I didn't even say anything to the guard to warrant his opinion and I have been to many water parks where, although there was not complete control, there was at least an attempt by the lifeguards to keep some structure. These are definately not Disney employees!The final thing is that there are signs that say that you cannot bring in outside food or drinks. The funny thing is that all sorts of people had food that they had somehow brought in. My advise is to bring in what you want and just wrap it in towels since they obviously don't check very closely. Keep in mind that a bottle of water is almost $5 and a slice of pizza is $7.We had planned to stay at the park until it closed at 7:00 but by 4:00, all of us were ready to go. Even my 11 year old made the comment as we left, ""at least we had fun at Magic Mountain yesterday."" Needless to say, we will not be back to Hurricane Harbor again.",GoAngels
40,Tons of Fun on a Hot Day!,"This was my first visit to HH. I had no expectations or preconceived ideas about the park. Upon arrival we rented a private Cabana. For $105 we got a cabana, 4 lounge chairs, a table with 4 chairs, innertubes, and 4 waterbottles.When we were escorted to our cabana we noticed the cabanas sit on a bed of fine sand. (The park walkways are all paved). The chairs and table were dirty and the lounge chair cushions had a lot of sand on them. My husband asked to have someone come over and clean the table off and wipe down the chairs. The employee told us to do it ourselves. :( OK> not the best start. So we had a small towel in our bag - we wiped everything down.Then off to ride some rides. The rides were all fun and thrilling. The temp. reached 105 so we learned quickly that flipflops are a must to get from slide to slide as the pavement was burning our feet.Overall we had a great day and a lot of fun. But there were a few things that were disappointing. First, the trash cans were overflowing. Especially ones at the top of a long flight of stairs. Considering this was apparent first thing in the morning- it meant that they did not empty the trash at night. We also noticed quite a bit of trash in bushes, under stairwells, and in the ques for attractions.The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only attraction I can speak negatively about is the lazy river that runs through the center of the park in a big circle. The water did not seem very clean and there was a lot of leaves and debris floating in the water. On the banks of this river the side walks were filled with dead leaves, so it seems maintenance does not rake and sweep up regularly to prevent the water from becoming dirty.Our Cabana rental came with ""food service."" Well... lunch time came and went and we never saw any service. My husband and daughter went off for 2 hours to have fun while I waited for food service. It never came. So we all went to the food stand and ordered lunch, carried it across the park back to our cabana to eat. THEN - the food service kids showed up and asked if we wanted anything. Too late - they missed out on earning a tip!I can't speak to the mens changing room. The women's changing room was a large open bay with metal benches. Several women had little boys that weren't all that little in there - so it forced women to change in the toilet stalls. That's not easy to do in a small space with wet floors. The shower is a large open bay with several showerheads. The water is only set to cold and you push a button and the water stays on for a few seconds. This made washing the hair cumbersome.These are small downers but did not affect my overall opinion of the park experience. It was really a lot of fun.",TamV
20,Be Prepared for Trouble,"What a disorganized mess this place was. We waited in line over 30 minutes in the hot sun with two anxious children to rent a cabana, and the customer service was horrible. The rides were fun, and our family ended up having a fairly nice day, but the park needs so many improvements, I don't have space here to list them all. My major complaint is about the inefficiency of the lines. The lifeguards were in no hurry to expedite the lines. I think the main problem is that they were understaffed and unskilled. We waited in lines up to 45 minutes, only to get to the top, where the line dissolved into chaos. Rather than demand the lines stay orderly, the lifeguard often just chose the child who was the most aggressive and loud to ride next. I tried to be assertive in not allowing people to cut line, but it was a losing battle I had to fight all day. Not all rides had this problem, some lifeguards were definitely better at keeping things fair. Despite these odds, my kids had a fun day because the slides were lots of fun. We went on a weekday in mid-July, and the place was crawling with unsupervised summer camp kids. I would not go back to Hurricane Harbor unless I knew that the lines would be shorter. A few days earlier, we battled long lines at Disneyland, but at least there was an organized system for moving people along. That was the frustrating part about Hurricane Harbor; I know that summer travel often means crowds. But what I can't stand is when there is a better, more efficient system, but no one seems to care. The lines for food were long at Hurricane Harbor; they ran out of large lockers to rent; they ran out of double inner tubes to rent; and I quickly ran out of patience. Management at the park doesn't seem to care about creating the best family experience it can.",PhilboydStudge
30,Pretty good. Some thugs. Some B.S. Long lines.,"We went to Hurricane Harbor on 7/29/2000, a hot summer Sunday, so you have to expect it to be crowded, and it was. Not TOO crowded, but crowded. Lines were 30-45 minutes for most rides [but no line for the ever-popular lazy river]. Some problems with large families cutting in line to get up to meet ""their cousins"" ahead in the lines. Be prepared to be assertive about instructing persons that cutting in line is not appreciated. The line to buy tickets was HORRIBLE looking.....buy tickets on line before you go!!!!! Then, avoid the annoying marketting guy who tries to ask you where you're from, what your phone number is, etc; and the annoying employees with cameras who try to make you pose for a picture. This is one example of some of the B.S. that could be eliminated by management. The price is OK [provided you used a coupon or on-line discount]. The food is expensive, and poor selection [hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken and pizza only]. But they do make considerable effort to keep the park clean, and maintain security [which is why we went there, and not Raging Waters]. A few surly looking types with tattoos, but not too many [again, better than the thug brigade that now rules at Raging Waters]. All in all, a fun day, but just avoid unnecessary lines [like, if you returned your rented inner tube, you got a coupon for a funnel cake, BUT the line for the funnel cakes was easily 45 minutes long, so who was going to wait for that at the end of a long day of waiting in lines?] Then, one final insult: the exit gate is BEHIND the long line to get your photos at the end, requiring you to either fight through the photo line, or jump the entrance turnstiles. Just a lot of small annoyances that add up to detract significantly from an otherwise fun experience. So, we'll probably go back, since we live nearby....but not real soon. The park needs to be expanded, and the food selection needs to be improved.",pameroo
