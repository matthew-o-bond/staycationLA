Saw ""Star is Born,"" there recently and hadn't been to the movies in a while. Was shocked to see concession prices but did appreciate the free and easy parking as well as surrounding eatery selection. Felt safe.",SilverLake2TheWorld

20,Bad Service for cancelled movie,Went to see a movie and after the previews no movie came on. Everyone waited for a while then nobody came and the place was still dark. Another person said he was going to check and he came back a min or so later said there working on it be just a min. About five minutes later a staff member comes in says it will be just a min. I walked out about 10 mins after that had to wait in a line to get a refund and then was given only one Free pass for my troubles.Didnâ€™t like the lack of concern for the staff about peopleâ€™s time. Or the fact we all spent a lot of money at the concession stand and didnâ€™t see a movie.,William H
30,Movie Time! - April 2017,"Tried this place on a Sunday night....not many people. Being in the mall, there's plenty of parking. Getting tickets and food was easy...again, not many people here that night. Now the main floor/concession area isn't all the big, so I can imagine it being easily crowded during peak times. They have a little birthday room if you are throwing a kid's party. Overall, the place was OK in my book. The seats are good, but in comparison to theaters that have transitioned to the reclining seats, they are way behind the times. So if you're looking to kill some time or want to take in a flick, this place is fine. Movie quality and sound is fine.",Kitman
