50,Beautiful Hidden Gem,"Rustic Canyon Park is a hidden treasure in Santa Monica. It's nestled away in a neighborhood, with a community swimming, free tennis courts, little kids play equipment and a club house.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/airbrush1212
40,Difficult to find but well worth it,"Using on board navigation to find this place will only get you so far. It is really off the beaten path. But that is the great thing about it. It is quite serene And it is usually only frequented by persons living in the neighborhood.The park itself is not very big but it is quite spacious. There is a nice playground for young children. The toilet facilities are pretty basic. There are plenty of tennis courts and I suspect that you will probably find one available just about anytime. All in all, if you are looking for a pleasant place to bring young children, essentially without any homeless persons, this is the place to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vincemc
50,Hidden treasure,"This park has a storied past with it being known as The Uplifters, ""drinking club"" during prohibition. The park is heavily forested with California Sycamores, Eucalyptus trees and oaks, which keeps it cooler than surrounding areas. It is more difficult to get to than most parks, as you must travel on narrow winding roads to get there. You will find a preschool, tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball diamond and children's play equipment. There are many classes offered for all ages and interests. A real treasure for the LA park and recreation department.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sixxmom
40,Hidden Park in Rustic Canyon .....,"The Rustic Canyon Park is rather unknown to most West siders, with the exception of the neighbors. Beautiful location surrounded by Eucalyptus trees, tennis courts behind & below, plus a nice public swimming pool. We discovered it when it was a voting polling place. Has Nature and art classes. Interesting! Enjoy.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Love this hidden gem of a park,Almost didn't review it because I covet the quiet of my local park which lies sequestered amongst old growth trees (part of a forestry experiment from the 1800s). This is a sweet park and they have great classes like Tennis and sculpture. They have an annual Halloween event and also do stuff at Easter. This is an historic property...the main building was the clubhouse for the UPLIFTERS...a motley and creative crew who counted L. Frank Baum (author of the OZ books) and movie moguls amongst their ranks. The park also has a indoor (and an outdoor) basketball court and picnic tables with BBQs that you can reserve for a bucolic old school cookout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFoolForTravel
