50,Great Park for the entire family,"This is a great local park in MB. It is large. There is a dog park which is always busy, people and dogs are very friendly. There is the Tot lot, for ages under 5, and there is the big kids park. All fenced off appropriately and safe. As well at Live Oak, there is the Scout House, which is about 50 years old and historical. a couple of baseball and soccer fields. The bathrooms are clean. There are also tennis courts and full time staff to make sure the courts are used appropriately. Reservations required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel

50,Very Nice Park,"A very nice park for children to play. They have a fenced in area for the small children to play in the sand & on some play things. They have a Little League field for the older children to play baseball. They might still have an art area for the young children. They have basketball ball courts and tennis courts. The first weekend of October the city has a 10K run and after the race which ends at the Pier, they have the Hometown Fair at the area of Live Oak Park. They have booths of food and crafts, jewelry etc. & they have a fenced in Beer Garden. It's a very interesting Hometown Fair. I highly recommend. They also have games and some rides for the younger children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SOCal71

50,Great Local Park With Hidden Gem,"Live Oak Park is a great little park with so much to offer. It has all the basics. Basketball courts (2), tennis courts, softball fields, lots of kids stuff (from LL baseball to playgrounds) and a super popular dog run. Note that for the tennis courts and ball fields a reservation is needed. All this is a 5 minute walk from downtown Manhattan Beach (and a 5 minute walk from the beach). That alone is worth the visit. Did I mention plenty of parking around as well?But what makes this park unique (and 5 stars!) is that it has a ceramics studio! This is a hidden gem in Manhattan Beach. I've been a student there for 6 years and it's always amazed me that people don't know about it.It's a complete studio - - 8-9 wheels for throwing with over 10 types of clay that can be used (and bought there) - 4 very large tables for hand-building and slab-making pieces (plus a slab roller and extruder) - 3 bisque kilns - 2 large final fire kilns - a raku kiln - a large glazing room, with 20+ glazes - numerous plaster molds - and moreThere are all kinds of classes to take for all ages. There are evening classes M-Th from 6:30-9:30 which are perfect for after work and plenty of daytime classes. Go to the City of Manhattan Beach web site and there is an Activities registration button and follow that. Open to all, not just MB residents. The instructors are pretty cool and open for students to do/learn anything.One last cool thing - if you are an experienced potter, they have what's called an ""Open Lab."" For a very low cost you can come in and use the studio facilities (no instruction though) for 4 hours. This includes getting your pieces fired that you created in the studio. They have 6 of these Open Labs scattered throughout the week (including weekend). Some really good artists there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cutro128
