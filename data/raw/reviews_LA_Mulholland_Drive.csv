50,Great vistas over LA,"We drove along Mullholand Drive on our own and saw many organized commercial tour groups at the overlooks where we stopped. This tour is best done on a clear day, for the best views of LA and the valley. We stopped at three overlooks, one overlooking the Hollywood Bowl, one overlooking Universal Studios, and one secret overlook which I will not reveal, but has amazing views of. . .well. . .I'm just not going to tell you, so the place doesn't get mobbed, in deference to the people who live there. There are amazing custom-built homes along Mulholland Drive, but most are hidden from view from the road, since they are built along cliffs overlooking the valley, for the view. This is a great tour for those unfamiliar with LA and wishing to get a bird's eye view.",RebelVirginia
40,Beautiful Scenery,"We rented a car and followed our GPS through Mulholland drive. There are several scenic stops where you can park your car, get out and enjoy the view. The houses are also quite impressive. Also saw a lot of ""star homes tours"", so I guess that's also one way to see the drive if you don't have a car.",Karim Maarouf

40,A long and winding road.,"We hired a car while we were in Los Angeles because you really can’t get around without one. And we thought would be an excellent idea to drive up Mulholland Drive, and it was. However it’s a little bit scary this is a very winding road, scenery is sublime particularly on a clear day.It would be very nice to be able to live there some of the houses are magnificent there are a couple of areas along the way where you can stop to take your photographs all in all it’s about 45 minutes drive from start to finish.Some people go in those rooftop little buses I wouldn’t recommend it, it can be very hot the road is very windy and I wouldn’t want somebody else being responsible for my life, however I did see some tourists in those buses.I’m very glad we did this drive even though at times we were a little bit nervous because of the winding road it was a beautiful picture way to see some of Los Angeles and would be lovely at night time. I wouldn’t be game to drive at night time though I’m not sure that there is any street lights.Don’t go on the weekend I believe it gets very very busy.",ParisMatch
50,I wish I lived here,Great scenery of Los Ángeles! If you’re lucky to catch clear skies you’ll definitely want to come around sunset time. Highly recommended.,Elizabeth Koch
50,Best experienced in a convertible,"An awesome drive in so many ways--the road is challenging (lots of curves), scenic, and star-studded. The best way to experience it is in a convertible, where you can get the full effect of estates teetering on hillsides, the difference in air quality in the Valley, and the sensation you're at the top of the world. This is a must-see, must-experience-at-least-once attraction.",Janet F
50,A couper le souffle!,"A long drive on Mulholland is a must. The scenery is beautiful, with it's hills,vallies,vegetation and mansions perched up on hillsides! I would say that it is worth driving along day (to see everything) and night (lights in the vallies),the view points are spectacular and in the evening try and get to a view point just before sunset and then just wait for the show to begin! You often drive by Mulholland to get to other parts of greater LA so don't hesitate to make a detour if it wasn't in your plans.",happyinparistimestwo
50,Hold on tight! A must see!,"Long winding road with huge houses, 2 lanes and there are some impatient crazy drivers trying to hurry you up. The views are incredible (Not much in the way of barriers so keep young children close!) and some of the houses are bonkers just hanging off the mountain! Quite a few lookout points that you can pull into and take some photos or watch the sunset.",The Simmons Family Adventures
40,An impressive drive,"We hired a car and did this at our own leisure instead of the many tours that are offered. It was incredible the sizes of some of the houses along this route and the celebs that live along this street. It was also great that there were many lookouts that gave great views of downtown, universal city, and more.",Matt_92aus
30,Just ok....,"The drive takes you up and up into the hills of Hollywood. Great views at the top, but getting there was a lot of back and forth winding roads. A couple of family members had a good ""motion sickness"" headache by the time we got to the top. Neat to see some more expensive homes....but otherwise, the drive was just ok.....",James L

40,Good LA experience.,We had the day to kill while waiting for our flight home so we rented a car and drove up to the Hollywood bowl and across Mulholland drive. First stop was Jerome C Daniel overlook where we got lucky and drove straight into a parking spot as it was vacated. Not many spaces here but good views of the Hollywood sign and surroundings and worth a short wait. We then stopped at Runyon canyon which had a rough unmade parking area but it was well worth it. We walked through the park to Runyon ranch and had amazing views of the city and flamboyant homes in the area. There are many other great views such as the Universal city overlook and more canyons so we hope to revisit one day and do some more walking.,gomms13
50,Great drive,"If driving around or out of L.A., it could be worth taking this iconic road. Parts are in pretty bad condition but it’s a very scenic winding road with lookouts on both sides of the mountains. The classic stretch is between the 405 and 101 but it stretches a lot further west and I’d like to drive that section.",mrdom

50,Beautiful,Went with a tour company to Mulholland Drive. The hills and the valleys were breathtakingly beautiful and the view over Los Angeles was amazing.Any downsides? The road is very curvy and I got a tiny bit nauseous when the driver sped up. You’ll be fine with the curves if you drive your own car and keep a moderate pace.,Helena Ö

50,THE ROMANTIC LIFE!,"There's nothing quite as exhilarating as driving Mulholland in a convertible (top down of course). It's a windy, windy road that takes you along the high road overlooking the vastness of the San Fernando Valley and the distant mountains, reminds you of Hollywood's mythic power, and fills you with joy. Glamor and beauty fused!",miriyamg
50,Nice alternative viewpoint of Hollywood sign,"We decided to check out the outlook point of the Hollywood sign from here because Griffith had no parking and it was very crowded. There was no one at the overlook when we went, and it was nice to have it all to ourselves. There are two points, one that over looks Hollywood/LA, and the other overlooks the sign itself. On a clear day, it's a great place to snap photos of the skyline and the sign!",hmill42894
40,Drove up to access good hiking trails,"Our uber took us up here in order to access the hiking trails around the nearby canyons. The views were very nice and what we could see of the houses were very elegant - however, most of the houses are set back off the road often down a drive or beyond high gates.",Amelia

40,On a clear day a beautiful view,"If you are lucky and you visit Los Angeles on a clear day, with no fog or smog or clouds, you may want to take a long ride on Mullholland Drive, on the top of the hills, crossing Los angeles county, dividing the city to two separate parts. The view on a clear day is breathless. The view changes with each hour of the day. It is strikingly beautiful early in the morning, when the sun sets, and in the evening.",NiliK

30,Twisting turning road,"Drove along most of it. There are several lookout points where you can get great views of the valley behind th hills. In some parts it is a bit of a rat run so long waits in traffic near the main roads that cross it. It's actually quite difficult to follows and especially on the crossroads, it goes off in directions you're not expecting. We lost it before we got to the part where it looks over LA itself. Don't expect to see much of the star's homes as they are invariably shielded by high fences or trees.",Anya L

40,A Tourist Drive to take,If you've seen enough TV and movies set in L.A. A drive down Mulholland Drive is a must. Great views all around and some wonderfully interesting homes. You wonder which Hollywood star lives in what. Something to do only once though,Chinapjs
30,Not a thing,"I wonder about a street being an attraction. It’s not like it’s Lombard. Lots of twists and turns and some idiots pretending it’s a road course. A few glimpses of impressive residences but I’ve never enjoyed gawking. People claim they go for the view, but why not just go to Griffith Park or the Observatory? In any case, pick a clear day especially if you want non-disgusting photos",Mike K
40,Fun to see,It's hard to be a tourist in LA. I lived in LA for a long time and now when I go back I know where i want to go and what i want to do. Mulholland drive is fun for the views and the cool homes. Nothing monumental to see in my opinion!,Lisa Wheeler

40,Fantastic!,If you have time I would recommend a drive on the famous Mullholland Drive. The views are fantastic.,Brian D

50,Really cool drive,This is a really cool yet dangerous drive uphill. There is a great view of the Hollywood sign from a lookout point. Just be cautious and keep your eyes on the road! Using a driver is a good idea so you can see the sights.,Kris91
50,A Great Experience that is Well Worth It,"My wife, daughter and her family and I recently were in the Los Angeles area. We flew into LAX and then went to the Getty Center (fantastic art museum that all but the very youngest will enjoy). I had heard about Mulholland Drive so we set aside time to drive it. We got on at the west end off Sepulveda Drive (that parallels the 405) and drove it till it ended at the 5. It is a very twisty road that skirts the top of the Santa Monica mountains. We drove it on a Saturday afternoon and the traffic was not bad at all. The views along the way are pretty incredible for those not used to mountains and canyons. There are many small viewing areas where you can pull off. 80% of them were on the opposite side of the street from the direction we were traveling (west to east), but we had no problem whatsoever entering them and getting back on the road. At one point we missed a turn and found ourselves on Coldwater Canyon Drive. After a short drive on Coldwater Canyon Drive, we found ourselves in Beverly Hills and enjoyed seeing the elegant homes. We drove around Beverly Hills a bit and then made our way back to Mulholland Drive. It was a mistake that I'm glad happened! One of the last viewing areas on the left side of the road gives you a great view of Universal Studios and Warner Brothers Studios plus Universal Hollywood park. The last viewing area on the right side of Mulholland Drive is the Jerome Daniels Overlook. From there, you can see the Hollywood Bowl (concert Venue) below you and downtown LA in the distance. Climb a long flight of steps and you get a good view of the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory. We had to wait a while for a parking spot to open up; the tourist vans had most spots taken. If all you are interested in is seeing the Hollywood sign, keep driving about 100 yards and you can clearly see it. It took us just under an hour with our stops and unplanned tour of Beverly Hills. We all enjoyed it (Grandparents through a 12 year old) and recommend it.",ejohnk
50,Great views and cool road!,My sister just bought a place up in this area and so we drove around a bit. Nice drive but you can’t really see into any homes if that’s what your into as they’re set way back from the road. The best is he views of the surrounding area and the road itself as it’s sometime narrow but worth it. If you have a car drive up and enjoy the view. Picture it 60 years ago with less houses and way less downtown area. Pretty cool drive though and Runyon canyon is right there too.,Josh79b
40,Scenic views,"A famous road in the area, with a many great views, Has winding spots in canyons, thru various neighborhoods both rural and city. A popular motorcycle route.

40,Mulholland Drive,"I went on a Hollywood tour, Mulholland is crazy! It is full of twists and turns in the hills! I am not a fan of heights, that is why I give it 4/5.

Many stars live in the area, houses are very large to say the least! You will get to see the Hollywood sign and all of LA, being up so high!

40,Drive yourself and enjoy!,"After seeing what feels like hundreds of movies, the road up in the Hollywood Hills is more than familiar. Mulholland Drive is rewritten, featured and filmed in a number of classics such as L.A Confidential. Obviously, you should take the curves in your own car instead of a tourist bus: to stay for as long as you want to gaze across the Valley, or over beautiful mansions on the other side are the very thing. In other words: drive yourself and enjoy!",PIPPY

40,Neat drive! * Where to start and how long to allow *,"Yes, it's curvy, so be careful, and watch out for crazies (we didn't see any but .. ), yadda, yadda. But, that's the easy part. If you're like I was, though, not a local and wondering where to start, which direction, and how long to allow, I can help, cuz lord knows I wrung my hands enough on those topics myself before our own trip ;)Travel eastward, starting near the 405 and ending near 101, which puts all overlooks on the right except the first two. I'd allow an hour, more if you want to meander any, such as into neighborhoods or, as we did, down one of the handful of ""...Cyn"" (aka Canyon) roads that dip down into Beverly Hills. We did both, and I'm guessing we were no more than 2 hours all in.Note for those doing a Hollywood tour: we did Legends of Hollywood (highly recommend!), but any that say they do Mulholland are likely the same, and what I mean is, we did it by car ourselves first, then again on the tour and guess what - the tour would have been enough, for us at least.Happy travels!",jboynsteph

40,Lynchesque,Nice surprise to take the road along the edge of the hills overlooking downtown LA and the Hollywood Bowl.,iWiebe
40,Watch out for stopping cars,There are some fantastic views both north and south of the road. At practically every turn someone is on the shoulder taking a picture. Watch out for the unexpected! I enjoyed the middle section from the 405 to Coldwater canyon the most since you get some glimpses of some phenomenal houses.,WestwoodTrekker
40,Great View in The Hills of LA and the Canyons,Fun ride (would have been much better on a Harley) with lots of curves and great views. Beautiful scenery and amazing homes on the hills sides. Pay attention to the time of day as traffic can be a hazard.,Stanton M
40,Thrilling Road divides L.A. & San Fernando Valley,"Mulholland Drive is a narrow 2 lane road that runs along the mountains that divide central L.A. and the San Fernando Valley. Because the road is very narrow (and there are NO barriers), there are only a few look-out points with very limited parking, however, the drive itself is breathtaking! Mulholland Drive runs East/West and can connect you to the main roads of Beverly Glen, Coldwater Canyon and Laurel Canyon Blvd. NOTE: You can take walking trails where Mulholland Drive meets Coldwater Canyon (look for Tree People sign). NOTE: If you can, avoid high traffic commute hours! NOTE: Take Coldwater Drive south to Beverly Hills. Take Laurel Canyon Blvd. south to West Hollywood.",weRtheWorld2016
50,Best drive in the world,Could drive up and down Mulholland all day. So many sights to take in and you never know what you might come across. Be sure to visit here in both day and night time. You won't regret it .,Rebecca H
50,Awesome views,"Mulholland Drive is a must do if you are in LA. The views of the Valley and the mountains are just stunning and in some points it feels like you are somewhere in Andalusia or Granada, with all the dry climates, beautiful Spanish Colonial homes, cypress and palm trees. Truly amazing.",mateo sz
40,Winding road leads to great views,Famous from the movie of the same name Mulholland Drive is a tricky road that climbs up and down The mountain separating Beverly Hills etc from the Valley. Very windy in parts but the views make it worthwhile. Just be careful of peak hour traffic,bigvicSydney
50,No Trip is Complete Without a Drive on Mulholland,"Make Mulholland Drive part of your itinerary while in Los Angeles. The views are immaculate, the homes are breath-taking, and the drive is serene. We usually start our drive from the most eastern point off of Cahuenga Blvd West. You'll climb up the hill and embark on your journey through the divider of Los Angeles and The Valley.To your left (if traveling West) you'll be able to see beautiful views of Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, the Hollywood Bowl, and everything South. To the Right will be beautiful views of the Valley, Burbank, Studio City, Universal Studios and Van Nuys.The best time to travel Mulholland Drive is both day and night. They both offer completely different views and experiences. My favorite time is just before sunset. You will be able to see the land change from light to dark. There are multiple viewpoints along Mulholland drive that are worth a stop. My favorite is the Hollywood lookout, but they lock it up promptly at sunset. The Universal lookout is my second favorite, which typically closes around 9 PM, though locals will stay later. These are stops along Mulholland Drive, keep your eyes peeled for signage, or look for the crowds and cars.A park ranger is always on duty ready to give out citations for violations. Proceed with caution if you choose to violate the posted signs.With each winding road and sweeping view, it's easy to fall in love with California as you travel along this historic road. You'll often times see Rolls Royce, Bentley, and other high end cars traveling along the road. Make way because there are often times exotics (like Lamborghins and Ferraris) that love to use their race car dynamics on this windy road. The posted speed limit is 30 mph, use it to your advantage to enjoy the views.Along Mulholland are great canyon drives, like Benedict Canyon Drive, Coldwater Canyon Drive, and Laurel Canyon Blvd. All offer incredible driving experiences through Bel Air and Beverly Hills communities. Laurel Canyon will take you through the Hollywood Hills, where many TV executives and stars live. To be honest, they live off of anyone of these roads, it's more fun to think about it than to go chasing stars for a picture.Bring your camera. If you go in the fall, the weather can be chilly at night. It's worth it to take a stop at any one of the lookout points to see Los Angeles from a different point of view. Enjoy!",Mikeywonderful
50,So different than driving a LA Highway,"Of course the dream road is to drive from San Francisco to LA through the Pacific Coast Highway. However, if there isn't time to do so, one nice and short alternative is to drive Mulholand Drive. You will be able to drive through Europe's like country roads, enjoy nice landscape views, see a lots of super and classic cars, etc. If you like cars and driving, then this is a must when visiting LA.",WernerM66
30,Great view...,Read up on Mulholland before you go. It will be more interesting.Lot of custom homes and great view. Its a street. What else can I say.. I went on a tour calledWe love lA... and we concentrated in Hollywood. Mulholland Dr. was on it.,sansa31
40,Crazy Road,"Driving Mulholland is not for the faint of heart. This road mainly runs along the top of a ridge, it is full of hairpin turns with extremely steep drop offs. But with the heart pumping you get unbelievable views. There are many areas to pull off and enjoy the views. This is a particularly hairy ride in the dark!",SueMass
50,Ribbon of road across the Santa Monica mountains,Ribbon of road across the Santa Monica mountains. Above the Sunset Strip and Hollywood it is the place to park on date night.

50,Is this the coolest bike ride of LA? (this should be on Strava),"LA is big, so I can't answer with 100% certainty, but it sure was a 100% experience in every aspect of views, sceneries and speed. Only limited parts of the route are affected by commuter traffic, so you should mostly feel safe. Choose your ascent well as it might either be very steep or time consuming. I chose Franklin Canyon and back through Nicholas. A perfect morning ride.",Florian G
50,THE VIEW,We went during the day and at night - the view is absolutely breathtaking - especially at night. Even though it was just a drive and a view - it was one of my favorite things we did. I'm still wishing I could live up there and look at that view!,Jennifer D
50,Go during the Day and at Night -,We drove this at night and then during the day. It has BREATHTAKING views. During the day we stopped at the scenic viewpoint. So beautiful. At night we just pulled off to the side of the road (probably not recommended). At night the twinkle lights of the city were amazing. Be careful! The road is very curvy and many people drive FAST! I took my time so I could experience the views.,emilymO4135ZQ

50,"If you have a Mustang, drive it!","Famous for the movie of the same name, and of course the private roads and gated communities of the rich and famous. The road winds up and through the Hollywood Hills from the Hollywood Bowl to the Belair Estate and down into Beverly Hills. If you have a car in LA its a must drive, there are plenty of viewing spots with stunning views across the city looking in every direction.Many of the tours drive the same road, I would also recommend doing a tour as they point out who lives where. But it's definitely a road you want to drive if you have a soft top Mustang or similar. Great part of LA.",RichardStuttle
50,A must see drive with amazing views,This drive was a major highlight. Wonderfully long and twisty road with amazing views of the city below and great houses along the way.

Girl have a great experience and see both the Valleyside and the LA side at one stop 👍",CoCo S
40,Very nice drive,"Very nice drive with some beautiful views and overlooks, but very bumpy drive at some roads as its an old road. Worth to drive if you got time while LA. I live here almost 4 yeas and drived there countless of times, so I do recommend it.",romanka2017

10,Mulholland Broken Road,"Crazy street with sharp curves. Folks drive fast and there's only a single lane in each direction. If you've gotta swerve to miss that oncoming car, you'd better hope there's not some idiot bike rider in your limited space! It's not any better at night as people just drive too damn fast and don't pay attention to staying in their own lane. If you're going to take a VERY WINDY ROAD then geez stay in your lane so others don't have to swerve into a biker or onto the gravel. Also the city really needs to pay more attention to the cracked roads and holes that chew up your tires.The traffic is miserable for bringing kids to schools there and picking them up and goes big to and from work and they've put signals here and there and the traffic is so heavy a couple of times a day as this area is a thoroughfare from the valley to the city and you need to wait...and wait to get past the signal.I avoid it like the plague",judysinger

To make a longer story much shorter we ate with him in a beautiful home over looking LA it was fantastic.",Paul H
30,Nothing special,We drove down Mulholland Drive and it was nothing special. I remember taking a picture of the street sign and that's about it. I'm sure we passed some celebrity homes along the way. Maybe if we had had a map of the stars homes it would have been more fun.,cathy d

I personally would not have to make the drive on this road daily.There are a lot of homes with a lot of history. Many celebrity residences in the area. The Jerome C. Daniel Overlook at the base of the road is beautiful for seeing the entire city.It was interesting to hear about the celebrities that live here on the tour I was on. However, I was not interested in returning. My favorite stop is the largest property in the county once owned by William Randolph Hearst now owned by a mysterious unknown owner.Good for one time experience.",VegasBling

On these little winding streets you will see some really quirky houses and some additional excellent views. These streets are not private, but they are narrow and sometimes with cars oddly parked, the passage is a tight squeeze.Although we did not drive Mulholland after dark on this trip, please do that one time. if you have a clear night, The views are like you have seen on TV and in the movies.",Robert W

If you are staying or going to Hollywood take the 405, Beverly Glen, Benedict Canyon or Coldwater Canyon and head East to the Cahuenga Pass - there are various lookout points and hiking spots. Bring refreshments as there are no restaurants or stops (with the exception of Beverly Glen just South of Mulholland where there is a center with great food options).

50,Surprisingly calm,"The drive is surprisingly calm, this close to the vibrant Los Angeles. You can understand why this is a preferred location to live...",Jorgfr
40,Very close to Hollywood sign,"I think it's the closest allowed place to Hollywood sign. Nice view of LA from there too. The only negative is that's by private houses, and the residents are not happy that so many tourists come and drive on those narrow streets, in some places only one car can go through. Also there is almost no parking but when you do find it you can stay there for very shoort time. So just go there, park, go quickly to take a selfie :-D and drive away ;-)",Gosia M
40,Good afternoon's worth of exploring,"It is great to drive and explore up on Mulholland, very now and again capturing a glimpse of something that appeals. Probably our favourite stop, was the Hollywood Bowl overlook. If you veer off the path and head down along a dirt-trail, you get some good views of Downtown, and also a distant view of the Hollywood sign.Appreciated the relative peace and calmness of the place, juxtaposed with the hustle below. It is predominantly residential in the hills, and the roads twist steeply amidst lush tree and plant life on the hillsides.Houses spring out of the vegetation in a variety of unique designs and sizes - some on huge stilts that look to be balanced so precariously on the slopes. Marvelled at their ingenuity, yet also sensed their fragility in the landscape.Well worth the drive.",Harrison F. Carter
40,Good Drive on a clear day!,If the weather is clear it is a beautiful drive. Plenty over over priced houses hanging over the rocks.,maxepr1
50,Mulholland Drive -- don't drink and drive!,We took a tour that brought us up Mulholland Drive. I knew there was no way my husband would attempt to drive this road with all of its curves and those folks who are familiar with the road really zip right around you like it was nothing! We made a few stops and saw homes literally built on the side of a hill that made you scratch your head. I would think rain or fire would be a homeowner's worst nightmare. Spectacular views including the Hollywood sign.,glapril
40,Nice ride through the Beverly mountains,The view depends very much on the weather conditions. Anyway you have a lot of amazing houses to see. Thee are some viewpoints hat you should not miss. Take at least one hour for that tour...,GWHAM
50,Beautiful drive up,"Beautiful scenery, roads not that windy (no need for dramamine). Two lane road takes you up to gorgeous scenery. See LA and Hollywood (the Hollywood sign and Hollywood Bowl), If you have the time you should do it.",KathleenPR
50,Nice views,Excellent views on a curvy road. Hire an Uber driver so you can take it all in. There's a pull over spot where you could get out and get a great photo of the Hollywood sign. The road is two lane and a little narrow so drive carefully.You can easily go to Hollywood walk of fame from here via car.,Chad R
50,Great Views Of Downtown and The Valley,These winding roads up in the hills give you some spectacular views of either Downtown or the Valley. There is a small parking lot on one side called the Mulholland Overlook that allows you views of Downtown and the Hollywood sign. Before it the Holywood Bowl Overlook gives you a decent view of Hollywood. On the other side the Universal City Overlook gives you views of the Valley. They're all pretty impressive. Even more so at night. These are the views you always see in movies of the new young hopeful coming to town with star in their eyes. This is what they usually are looking out over as they reassure themselves they're going to be a star someday. The thing at night is these overlooks are technically closed. Usually around 9PM. There are warnings of being ticketed. I parked near the Universal City one and was able to get a few snaps off without any trouble. Maybe I was just lucky. For the Downtown views at night I'd suggest going up near the Runyon Canyon pairing lot. It's closed but there's a section near there where you are allowed to park on the street. Park there and walk a little down and you'll find great views of Downtown at night.,Polaroids & Drinkin Stories

40,Amazing view of L.A. Skyline,"While I was in LA, I wanted to get a night time view of the city. After a few Google searches I ran across Mulholland Drive. It's a site to see either day or night. If you're visiting LA or planning to, put this on your bucket list.",Ryan

An nice drive with great views of the city and valley - not only for David Lynch fans. Plan 60-90 min for the whole drive including the view points. Maybe an other 30 min to be at the last view point at sunset.,Christy212121
40,Nice views in a few spots,"Mulholland Drive runs along the top of the Hollywood Hills. From this point you have views of the San Fernando Valley to the north, and downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Beverly Hills to the south. From the road, most of the views are obscured by private homes. There are a number of overlook spots that you can stop at.The two best spots are the Hollywood Bowl overlook at 7036 Mulholland Drive, where you will be able to see downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. The next spot is at 8401 Mulholland Drive, where you will get a very nice view of Burbank and the surrounding San Fernando Valley.",JustAVacationer

50,"Iconic views down onto the city, from a street that winds along the side of the Hollywood Hills and mountains","The views on Mulholland Drive are amazing...just wish I wasn't the one driving so I could have enjoyed them more thoroughly. You are essentially doing the equivalent of driving on the side of a mountain that allows you to look down on the city.In all the explanations I heard of Mulholland Drive before actually getting on it, I didn't understand. They all said ""scenic"" but I didn't understand that you looked DOWN on the city rather than driving THROUGH a scenic vista. When we finally got on it, I was like ""ohhhhh...THIS is Mulholland Drive."" I'd seen the views below depicted before but just didn't understand that the vantage point of the photos was Mulholland Drive.",ObjectiveWords

Totaly true.Whoever is driving is not able to pay attention to both.Now , about the tours that tell you about the artist s house. MOST of them you will either see the roof or the gate of the condo.Still, for me it was worth for the view!!!",Ingrid B
40,Nice ride,"Good views of LA and the Hollywood sign, there are multiple places to stop to take pictures. Of course also nice to see the big houses although you can only see a small portion of what is actually there.I wish I was here with my motorbike but also with a car nice to drive.",Cihat G
50,It only costs you about 2 dollars in gas for amazing photos,"Honestly, a must. Breath taking views that even my hard to please daughters enjoyed. The drive along mulholland alone is pretty awesome, but throw in all the over looks for some fantastic photos, and it is a home run. A Los Angeles must. From the Hollywood sign, to downtown LA to the valley , to amazing homes....and , every once in awhile, you might see a star or two. A great ride and a great view",Michael A

50,Awesome drive,"We drove this as a part of our private tour and made stops at several overlooks. While it is indicated as Beverly Hills, some of its best view are of the San Fernando Valley on the other side. There is a great one looking at Universal where you can see the park and studio lot. Also there are some great views at some very pricey real estate. It was great to learn about how Mulholland designed the road to give citizens the access and exposure to great vistas years before there was any development. It is one drive you have to make.",Grover R
50,Mad Mulholland Drive,This is a crazy road that has the view of the whole of Los Angeles. Some of of the drivers there are going way too fast although once you pull over the view is addicting. Plenty of bickers and hikers in the area and a truly long and winding road..,DeniseCohenGershon

50,One of my favorite places in LA,"I go back to Mulholland Drive every time I am in LA. It's a classic and yet a place which gives me something New every time, to. I enjoy the surprise of every turn. The wondering of who lives where and the marvellous views to the North and the South. Especially the view of Hollywood, downtown LA and the Hollywood sign from the very same spot near The Hollywood Freeway. This time it was very smoggy and we couldn't see downtown but usually it's visible.",Kim C
30,Drove up this road to see some stars' homes,"It was neat to drive up to see the homes of some stars. Many of them were hidden by big gates but it was neat to go there. If you are short on time, it wouldn't be worth going here becasue the homes that you can actually see are limited.",Christine M

30,Very nice landscaping. Houses are OK I guess,"With a swanky reputation, I expected houses that would be a little more than above average. Also they're not particularly secluded given that every other vehicle there is a loaded tour van or bus.Excellent views of both LA to the south and the valley to the north (at different spots).A tour guide (see above comment about vans and busses) might have been nice if only to say who lived where.If you get car sick, you may want to pass this up because the roads are very curvy.",mitch708

40,I hesitate to endorse! 😳,"Mulholland Drive is a long and winding street which meanders across the Santa Susana Mountains. Most popular is an area where Mulholland falls on the mountain where it separates ""The Valley"" from Hollywood, Beverly Hills and more.---Mulholland runs east-west while several other streets run north-south bring commuters back and forth between the two sides. (Laurel Canyon, Coldwater Canyon and Beverly Glen)Mulholland offers beautiful views on clear days and at night, but, please take care while driving. It is a busy two lane road that can be a bit dangerous when people are looking at the views and searching for a place to stop and admire the view.Be cautious and considerate of those whom are simply wishing to get home or to work--- otherwise, enjoy and take it easy with a gentle trek on this famous drive. 🌷",bubbly_sunshine

50,Winding road with breathtaking views!,"This is definitely a drive not to do by yourself, like I did, as you are too busy looking at the views rather than on the windy road ahead! I drove along Mulholland Drive from west to east, entering from the 405 highway and exiting at the 101 highway. There are spectacular views on both sides of the 'mountain' southward overlooking LA, north to the sprawling suburbs and mountains and views down the valleys to the Pacific ocean. I had read somewhere that if you wanted to stop off at the Hollywood Bowl lookout, it was easier to enter the lookout carpark if you were heading east along Mulholland Drive. However, as I was driving by myself and there was very little signage for entering the carpark, I literally drove straight past with nowhere to turn around. I will definitely be returning to Mulholland Drive again next time I am in LA so I can stop and soak up the magnificent views!Visited February 2016.",Alison P

Well, if one believes in the Law of Attraction and Deliberate Creation, then this is the place for you! It is such an awesome and breathtaking view of homes of the ""rich and famous."" For the correct location, dive up Crescent Heights until you reach Mulholland Drive- Make a left on Mulholland, and keep going past the first location where the wooden fence is located (this fence is closer to the street).

It is also one of the most exclusive and most expensive residential areas in the world. It is a very scenic drive which should not be missed out.,CarlaColumna123
20,Disappointing,You would expect this to be a street of luxury since some of the big stars live here. Not anything like i expected. The streets of Beverly Hills below the hills have much more to drop your jaw. Mulholland drive is just a long winding road with views to the valley and occasionally out to sea. All the homes that may have wow factor are not visible from the road as they ate in gated communities with security. DONT DO A TOUR! Too long! We hired a driver for 4 hours and he got us to all the spots we wanted waiting while we checked out Rodeo drive etc. This worked out cheaper than a tour snd we had a flash car with a chauffeur. Some people even videoed us as they thought we were famous hahaha.,Lisa B

There are some very exclusive houses up here (Jack Nicholson, Reese Witherspoon, Ben Stiller live along here) but the very large houses are set well back into the hillside and well away from the road. There are lovely views of the city of LA and also out to Burbank.

We saw some nice houses but suspect we didn't see the top celebrities houses or the outstanding ones. If you really want to know all about the celebrities homes then I suggest do one of the Starline Tours. We decided to try and do it ourselves but got very lost and ended up going off all over the place. Saying that great scenery from the top of the hills over Hollywood and some amazing real estate.

50,A Romanic And Utterly Scenic Vantage Point,"Few, if any American cities are built in around a mountain range as Los Angeles is.Mulholland Drive overlooks the San Fernando Valley as it runs above Hollywood and Beverly Hills on the northern ridge of the Santa Monica Mountains about 15 miles to Woodland Hills.During daylight the vantage point is often shrouded by poor air quality, smog and dust. The first inhabitants called it ""The Valley of the Dust"" as its geographic and topographical features created a closed huge bowl being bordered on the north by the San Gabriel and Santa Susana mountain ranges and the south by the Santa Monicas and Hollywood Hills. This also results in The Valley being hot, often very hot and stagnant air.However, at night when the land cools, ocean breezes are sucked it and the air bring much clearer allow romantic views of millions of flickering and glimmering lights across and the length and breath of the Valleu below.",Richard C

The mountains reminded me of the ones in Alaska, with drops hundreds of feet down if you were to run off the road.We gained a real appreciation for just how much of a desert CA has become. It was a dust bowl. I completely see how one tiny spark can make 1/2 a mountain go up in flames in moments.It was so dry and dusty, with lots of ranches, and quite a bit of property for sale. With the level of dryness, it's easy to see how mudslides and wildfires happen.However 77 and sunny everyday...is worth the risk!

No need to buy an expensive tour, just come up Outpost Drive from Hollywood or Laurel Canyon from West Hollywood and start driving. There are scenic overlooks all along the route and plenty to see. Be sure to bring a camera. Fine to bring a lunch but be sure not to leave any trash because there is a huge fine for littering along Mulholland.",love2skiLosAngeles

50,It's great but it ends,This iconic road still offers some spectacular views and I still make the drive often but most people don't realize that Mulholland Drive no longer goes all the way through. It ends at a parking area in the hills. You park and then you can walk the rest of the 'old' drive that is no more than a dirt road now. It's fun and I would suggest it for anyone.

30,Good Views of Los Angeles But There Are Better Drives,"If you want a quick trip to the higher elevations over Los Angeles where you get a pair of great views, then this is very worthwhile. If you are looking to see movie stars' homes, then this is also somewhat for you, as long as you know who lives where (or have a guide) and don't mind seeing only the garage and rear entrance for the most part. On the other hand, not far away is at least one spectacular drive with several turn outs offering almost constant, breath-taking views of the Santa Monica mountains, the Pacific and some unbelievable homes that can be seen from several different angles. (Look for my review of Rambla Pacifico.) Be sure to pack a jacket as it can be very breezy on the overlooks.We began our drive up Laurel Canyon Road off of Hollywood Boulevard as recommended by some to make it easier to get into the second (Jerome Daniel/Hollywood Bowl) viewing turnout. The climb up consists of several quick and steep switchbacks on a very busy road. If there are locals behind you, they will make you well aware you are travelling too slowly for their liking - pull over when it is safe to do so and let them pass. At the top is a 3-way intersection at Mulholland. We turned right to head toward the Universal City overlook, which is just a short drive up ahead. The overlook is on the left, but there is parking on the right side, also. It offers a very nice view, but you probably won't be there long.Back in the car, it's only a short ride further to the Jerome Daniel overlook. There, expect to find the parking lot full of tour groups and others. We were lucky to find a space in that lot, but there are also wide aprons just after the lot on which others had parked. Here, you will probably want to spend more time. There is a staircase up to an upper viewing area that offers nearly 360 degree views, including the Hollywood Bowl, Downtown L.A. (if it's not to hazy), the Hollywood sign and a spectacular home built just above the overlook by someone who must not mind looking down on all the tourists and having them look back up at him. More time is needed here because there is more to see, and you will probably have to wait for others to move in order to get your best photo angles.After that, it's a short ride back down the hill and off to your next destination.",Remdawg30

40,Surreal sunset drive,"We took a driving tour around Mullholland drive and sunset boulevard. It was a little surreal, driving down those curving roads that I've seen in so many movies. Each street sign seemed somehow familiar, each cliff looked like a set. Our driver was entertaining but too obsessed with house valuations in the area, which we didn't really care about. Even so, the perfect weather and delightful scenery made this one of my favourite moments in the US.",HushidarKharas
50,Make sure you go all the way,Driving on Mulholland is something you should do once and then do it again and again. Make sure you go slow and make sure your driver is paying attention to the tricky road and not all the cool sites. Once you have had a pass switch drivers so the other person can look. Also make sure you take it from start to finish in both directions. The Encino Hills terminus is really excellent. Throughout you will have views off either side of the road which traverses a ridge on a mountain range separating LA from the Valley. Be sure to stop lots of times at the turnouts and parks. Also take a couple dives down the mountain on either side to explore. Driving through Laurel Canyon is really cool,George Y

50,A must see Los Angeles drive….,There is no other better way then to drive Mulholland to get a feel for LA. Stop and make a wish….dreams really do come true in the City of Angels.,dawnwtv
50,Great view,"It's a very beautiful drive to go on the Mulholland Drive. It offers a great view of the LA surroundings and you can also see a lot of celebrity houses along the way, even though the gate does not say who is living where.",Malin_o_Jonas
50,Remembered Mulhulland from TV shows and movies and wanted to see it in person,Don't miss this one! Beautiful scenery we went twice. Would love to go again! Make sure to take at least two drivers so you can switch out so everyone gets to enjoy the view.,jvillemom15
40,"Enjoy the lazy, crazy, hazy days of summer","Have to agree with those reviewers who remark this drive can be confusing, but it was worth it.Rented a Mustang convertible while I was in town and put the top down. I was flying solo on this afternoon, checking out the amazing homes and wonderful views.I can imagine it would have been more enjoyable for my passengers - IF I'd had any! But there are certainly worse ways to spend an afternoon either way...",sox1fan
40,Stars Homes Tour,We were on a tour of Homes of the Stars. The tour through Beverly Hills and Sunset takes you up into the hills which gives you a great view of the valley (if it's a nice clear day).,dinnersistas
40,Cool Views & Drive,We rented a Camaro to make this drive and it was good. It has some great views and really sweet houses. Not much time to look if you are driving but let the passenger take pics. There are some overlooks where you can stop and take them also. It is a cool place to see and I would do it again.,rjr88
30,Nice drive,Drove a bit of Mulholland Drive on a recent trip to LA. Provides great views of the hills. It is a twisty turny road so not great for those that suffer from travel sickness! The houses around here are pretty spectacular !,Sashakins09
50,Gorgeous Homes and Lovely Views,"You simply must cruise Mulholland Drive when you are in the Beverly Hills area. The homes are absolutely gorgeous and the view of the Valley are breathtaking. You have plenty of opportunities to take pictures. Best to go during the day though, not so much at night. The road is very windy and it's fun if you are in a sports car like my friend and I were. Anyway, enjoy yourself and make time to relax during your adventure.",Pamela H
40,Windy with great views but also confusing,"Drove Mulholland Drive from the 410 with the intent of going to the 101 freeway. It's a very windy road, which makes it fun, but also made one of my kids car sick. We did have some great views of the valley to the North! I did find staying on the road confusing. One time there was a fork in the road and it wasn't clear which way to go to continue on Mulholland and I chose the wrong way. It was minor requiring a quick turnaround. Continuing on, I came to a stop light where again it wasn't clear whether to veer to the right or continue to the left. Again, I chose wrong. At this point, with time being my enemy, rather than turn around, I continued to my destination at Universal City. I wonder if that segment of the drive had the best views of LA? Ultimately, I'd recommend the drive, but give yourself some time in case you find yourself off the path to get corrected.",redbird71
50,Take the Drive With Your Top Down,"This was probably one of the highlights of our recent trip to Beverly Hills. The drive up and down is completely breathtaking, and the houses that lie upon this distinctive drive are just jaw dropping. There are plenty of turnouts for you to stop to take photographs. The only bad part is that if you want to do it at night there are hours when you can't stop. Our drive was during the day so it didn't affect us. I would say this is a not to miss experience if you are in the Los Angeles area!",camrachic
40,Well worth the experience,The views - allow time as its slow driving plus you want to see the city from up here. We also took in the observatory on the same trip out.,Rory Atkins
50,"Drive ""The Snake""","Just like on TV this is a must drive road when in LA. Safe, slow and not too crowded despite its location. Note designed for SUV's - drive it in a car with no more than 2-3 in the car. Good house-viewing and spectacular vistas.",B P
50,A curvy drive - nice view,"It is a curvy drive up the hill and we stop at the first viewing are. Even though the day was hazy, we had a nice view of LA, Hollywood Drive, the Hollywood sign, the Hollywood Bowl, The Capitol Records building, etc. It was very nice.",maggiet0813
50,a great starting point to get to the Hollywood sign,"From here, it is an easy walk along some great trails to not only see the hollywood sign but to see what the sign can see, a fantastic panorama of LA",fishinwater
40,Take the drive..,Take the drive if you have the time. The Hollywood Hills are beautiful and it is amazing to see the size of the mansions up there! There are many spots to pull over and look at the amazing views. Just do it!,spilcher26
50,Beautiful Drive on a Clear Day,"I drive Mulholland Drive several days per week between the 405 Freeway and Coldwater Canyon north of Beverly Hills. The road is very curvy with great views of both the San Fernando Valley and downtown Los Angeles. Along some curves are sweeping views of West Los Angeles and the coastline. On extremely clear days, like the day after a storm, I can see the large freighters off the shore in San Pedro. In the winter, on occasion, the mountains in the north valley will be frosted with snow and you have beautiful views of snow capped mountains to the east of Los Angeles. The only place to get food and drinks along this stretch of road is the shopping center on Beverly Glen about a quarter mile south of Mulholland Drive. There are restaurants and a Starbucks here.",alanmhersh
50,Just a fantastic drive!,"If you grew up listening to the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean, or really anything to do with Hollywood, you will have heard of Mulholland Drive. This a twisty turny road that weaves through to hills with great views everywhere you look. See the Hollywood sign from the Hollywood Bowl overlook. Yes, the Hollywood Bowl, where the Beatles played! The homes that are perched on the edges of the hillsides vary from cute little bungalows to mansions and each one seems cooler than the last! My wife was in the backseat and was scared out of her mind for the lack of guard-rails, but hey, why ruin such a great view!",framemanusa
50,Beautiful drive through the mountains,"Rent a convertible and drive Mulholland Drive on a nice day. Lots of celeb homes along the way but you can't really see much of that because most are behind gates, bushes and private driveways. Also can be a lot of traffic pushing you along so hard to drive slow and look unless you pull into the turn-outs to see the nice view. We stopped often and took pictures but the scenic drive is the draw here.Once you start there doesn't seem to be anything along the way so make sure you have food, drinks and bathroom breaks before you start.",Tom H
40,Would have been nice!,"But I didn't know that the lookout point closed at 10pm! Managed to take some photos from the other open areas along the road, but they were not the best locations for photos.",88_elwood_88
50,A must,"The views were Gorgeous! We drove here after driving up the canyon from Hollywood and wow, the views! I would say that you must do this in Beverly Hills. Having a car in LA is also essential. Pretty homes along the way!",caztravels
40,Breathtaking views,"We went on one of those Hollywood homes tours so naturally we ended up on Mulholland Drive. It was interesting to see where certain celebrities lived. A few days after the tour, we came back with our car to take a look at everything again. I was amazed at the views you can get along this street and surrounding areas. At certain points along the street, the roads get really narrow and extremely windy so take care, especially at night. There are some ""lookout points"" where you can pull over and take some great pictures!",Christina G
50,Beautiful drive,"Lots of beautiful views, both panoramic and architectural. Adequate places to park for views.Really gives you a topographical perspective of LA",David S
50,What a view,Narrow and whined roads but worth the time and effort. Beautiful view of the Hollywood sign. Beautiful homes to see along the way. Lots of cut outs to park for pics. A must do.,sammied3000
40,See Los Angeles from the mountains around LA.,You feel as you look on Los Angeles from the sky seeing the city as pilots see when flying over the region..,Israel B
40,Uninhibited view of the city,"Entering this drive from the city gave me a non commercial and uninterrupted feeling. I stopped at one of the high points there and was in awe of the lights, mountains and valleys. Short, no cost and beautiful.",Pooja J
50,Really fun!,"A fun drive, allowing us to enjoy the beautiful view of Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and the Hollywood sign. It's a pleasant outing with family and friends. It gives us a chance to see another part of Los Angeles that we probably wouldn't be able to see from a different location in Los Angeles (e.g.: downtown). I recommend it to everyone!P.S.: I've went there in 2010, but I wasn't able to choose an older date than December 2013.",Amelie1991
50,A wonderful Motorcycle road.,"As one of the classic and most iconic motorcycle roads in the world, Mulholland can't be beat.My husband and I have traveled it many a time. The views are incredible. But you must be aware of others, as tourists often are looking at the views, or taking photos, and not watching the road sufficiently. Don't be surprised if youngbloods and their friends are filming themselves around the famous hairpin turns...either on motorcycles or skateboards. Have a picnic at the park, and then enjoy the California sun. Or, perhaps go to the Getty in Malibu for a wonderful ending to a perfect day. (The parking used to be free if you are on a motorcycle. I hope that is still true!) Not recommended if there has been a slight rain, as this section of road gets little cleansing from rains, and can become quite slick with road oil.",AliLosAngeles
30,Worth it for the views of LA,Glad we did this for the views of LA- particularly of the Hollywood sign from the bowl overlook. Don't expect to get too close to the houses as they are distant from the drive.,David E
50,Fun to Drive!,"On a recent road trip to LA, my sisters and I started off our visit by driving this amazing winding road. It was so much fun!! The road itself is fun, with its many twists, turns, hills, blind corners, etc. But the views are not to be missed! LA looked so gorgeous in the late afternoon sunlight! I fell in love at first sight! There are many viewpoints where you can pull over to enjoy the views, so even though I was the driver, I still felt like I got to see a lot. Plus, because of the narrow winding nature of the road, you can't go much faster than 20 mph, so it's ok to take a peek at the view now and then. We didn't have a map to the stars with us, but still enjoyed checking out the huge mansions up on the hill.This was a great way to start our stay in LA. I highly recommend!",JilliePepper
40,A lovely view,"I decided to drive up here on my first morning in LA and try to orient myself a little. It was an incredible view. I drove up Laurel Canyon road and turned right initially. I pretty quickly came to the Hollywood Bowl overlook where there was a nice view of the sign, at which point a quick consultation of the map and i decided to make the trip back along the other direction to Stone Canyon overlook as it seemed like the best place to turn back before hitting the next freeway.I did take it easy and stopped off at a few view points (probably drove some locals nuts with my speed!) and I'd certainly recommend it on a clear quiet morning if you've a car and time to do it.",NellEdinburgh
50,Always the driver,"I've always been the driver rather than the passenger when driving Mulholland so I cannot comment directly on the views, but judging from passengers' reactions, it is awesome. It's a fun road to drive fast on!",CarmichaelVentura
30,CraZy winding road,"this is a narrow road deep in the hills. I wound up on it turning wrong direction to my friend home in laurel canyon ( another magical place). It's unreal the hills, vistas. The drive is not for those with easy stomachs",baindextar43
30,It will make you sick!!,"If you find this helpful please click helpful below.This attraction is historical, it has wonderful views of the hills and surrounding areas.... BUT you can get car sick from the elevation combined with the twist and turns in the road!!!! Almost everyone felt sick. There are many stars that live in the area.Worth doing it once.",Tripking07
50,Map to the Stars,"Long drive through gorgeous surroundings. Many points to stop and just admire. Purchase a ""Map to the Stars"" from Hollywood when you arrive in Los Angeles, California. Good starting point. Mulholland Drive ends in sunny Malibu. This drive gets better and better",Detoxrus
50,The famous road of danger and beauty!,"This road of twists and turns and blind corners and unforgiving drops is still a favorite to drive when in town. There are great little patches of dirt along the road that are excellent to pull over to and snap some incredible pics of a variety angles of every portion of LA. You have to be quick to pull over though, they are very small and sneak up fast!The best views by far are the one gated area where a tiny parking lot lends itself to absolutely stunning views of Hollywood and downtown LA, overlooking the Hollywood amphitheater. Those is for a little stair climbing can walk up some raggedy steps to the peak of this hill and have a dynamic unobstructed view of the iconic Hollywood sign.Another great spot is when you wind around to to overlook Universal Studios. It's a really fantastic view, just watch your step, one wrong move could send you tumbling down below in certain places! :-)",DoubleOIncognito
50,What a way to watch the sun go down,As the sun sets the views across LA are just amazing. Sitting looking out from the top of the hills and watching the lights come on all over LA /Hollywood is fantastic. A mst see.,22tangotwo
50,Stunning views of LA,"This is a great drive on a windy road with many lookout points. Though some do the drive because of its presence in movies or because of celebrities who have homes here, the best part is the great views this offers of the LA area.For those wanting to see the Hollywood sign, it's visible from the Hollywood Bowl Lookout point (the first lookout once you turn onto the Drive from Cahuenga).",rlennon1
10,The map sucks.,"The map for Mulholland Dr. Points to the 3rd St. Farmers market and not at all Mulholland Dr. We were at the Dolby theater on Hollywood Blvd and wanted to go to Mulholland Dr. Which we could see in the north. But the map kept leading us to the opposite direction. When I realized and typed in using the Google map, it did the same thing. Surprisingly both maps are wrong at the same location. I have never encountered this before. I was back and forth 3 times for 2 hours and we had to give up the Mulholland dr.",Charles S
50,Great views for free,"Don't bother getting on a gimicky celebrity tour. If you have access to a rental car, nip into the hills and take in the scenery from the viewing point closest to hollywoodbowl.",TGJessEv
50,Great View of LA!,"We decided to take recommendations of TripAdvisor and visit the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. We had hoped to arrive before sunset but unfortunately the LA traffic would not allow that! It was after the drive to this destination that I set my GPS to avoid Highways. The rest of the trip had a lot less traffic involved!! This is a beautiful overlook day or night! BEWARE there are very few parking spaces probably around 6 with 1 handicap space. For those looking for an address to put into your GPS 7036 Mulholland Drive LA, CA works great! We arrived just before dark and was able to watch the city below light up. Its beautiful and I am always a sucker for night time photos!",Cheryl S
50,Attraction # 1 for the right reasons!,"you need to drive on this road.lined with the nicest designed houses on both sides, you get to see the beverly hills life!there are some really awesome look out points. we first wanted to do it at night, but then realised there wouldnt be much to see except for lights!that was the best decision we made! what awesome sights!if you get on this drive from central LA and go all the way thru, you can then go down to the getty museum which is another must see.another tip is follow the existing sightseeing tour buses, they stop at the best spots!! but people hardly get off, you should tho!make sure you get out and check out all the look out points. definitely worth it!",fahym
50,Holland Drive/Hollywood/Beverley Hills bus tour,"Highly recommended. Mulholland Drive in particular was the highlight of a two hour bus tour. Loads of stars houses, but the views of LA were stunning - only matched by Griffith Park. Definitely get a bus tour including this beautiful stretch of road!",Thomas S
50,Scenic and spectacular!,"We loved driving along Mulholland drive and we were astounded at the beautiful view from high on the hillsides of LA. Its best seen during the day and it's a very twisty drive. You'll feel like an Indy or Formula 1 racer as you drive it. There were locals behind us and no where to really pull over for much of it so you're pressed to drive at a faster pace than the scenery allows. Thankfully my passenger snapped a few panoramic pics along the way. Even the best of drivers shouldn't attempt taking pics (and definitely NO selfies) on this drive. It requires your full attention. As a fan of fiction writer Michael Connelly and his fictional LA. cop ""Harry Bosh"" it was a thrill to come out near Woodrow Wilson drive, the fictional home of Harry's house on a real Street in LA. We're gonna drive Mulholland again when traffic is lighter.",0221Serendipity
50,Great views,Having read other reviews about this Drive we drove up here. The views are great of LA including the Hollywood sign and there are convenient places to stop to take pictures.,cazand1988
50,Gorgeous views of the city and the famous Hollywood sign,"Hold on to your seat and stomach as it is a narrow, winding road in the hills and canyons! Great drive late in the afternoon to ""sigh""-see the million dollar homes and scenic vistas showcasing LA and surrounding suburbs. A few pull offs so that you can step out and take a photo or two of the Hollywood Bowl and the Hollywood sign. Definitely worth the time and easy to access from Franklin Rd/Hollywood/Highland area.",LHarp12
30,great view,most of celebrities homes in muholland drive are gated and cover with trees. We were only able to look into celebrity homes from the distance. but we do enjoy the view from uphill and stop at hollywood bowl to take a picture of hollywood sign and city as background.,endang s
40,Hollywood Bowl overlook,Take the time to do this drive. Especially stop at the Hollywood Bowl Overlook. Bring your camera. There are other stops but this one us the best.,Dave K
40,A memorable drive,Such a famous road that you really should carve out some time for a short side trip and drive this iconic route. Some if the side roads are actually more quaint and impressive. Look around but keep your wits about you as it is busy with double lanes (and gawkers) on both sides.,JSD_West
50,Stunning views,"Take the twists and turns along Mulholland Drive past the large houses and you'll be wondering, who lives there? Eventually you will reach the scenic overlook. Pray for a clear day. Los Angeles, Burbank, Hollywood Bowl, Hollywood Sign, and the rest. The views are stunning and well worth the drive.",Malcolm H
50,Drive along Mulholland Drive,"Unbelievable views of the city from this road! Drive carefully and slowly, lots of curves and turns, but there are quite a few areas where you can pull off and take pictures.",Deborah3302
40,Fantastic views,One of the best places to stop by at when visiting the Los Angeles area. The place we stopped at gave us a view of Burbank and Universal City. We were there around 2 AM so there wasn't much traffic...other than the occasional overspeeding car. The road is a really fun drive if you're into that sort of thing. The curves and sharp turns make for a exciting ride. Didn't see any cops but came across 3 wolf looking animals. Could've been dogs but can't be sure.,Alihaider M
50,Stunning scenic drive,"We joined a 2.5-hour-long open-top bus tour and, although it was as cheesy as expected, this turned out to be a great way to see beautiful Mulholland Drive. The views from the steep slopes over downtown LA and the Hollywood Bowl were amazing. The architecture along the way is fantastic, as well, with all the million-dollar homes and celebrity mansions, plus there's an endless stream of beautiful and expensive cars to be envious of.",Ottawatraveller88
50,Amazing at any time of the day.,"The drive is beautiful, but rather short. The road itself isn't greatly maintained and are quite windy so be cautious!I visited twice, once during the day and another at night time - both are beautiful, though night time was a but more spectacular. The views of LA are great! Not to mention the incredible houses (mansions) you pass on the way.",Brooke V
40,Great views,"Beautiful drive, but a quite short one, as we drove west-east, from the 405 freeway to Cahuenga Blvd just off the 101 freeway. Most of the stops are on the northern side of the road with vistapoints towards Sherman Oaks and Burbank, but the main stop (at least going by the number of people stopping) just above the Hollywood Bowl is on the southside - something to keep in mind depending on if you're driving on a busy day, The views are very nice, especially towards the downtown are and the Hollywood sign.The homes along the drive are quite magnificent, as expected, so the more surprising part of the drive is the outright poor quality of the road. Maybe a way for the locals to make the drive less pleasing for tourists? :-)",Andreas B
40,Nice at night,"We were taken to this road by a local. We enjoyed the night time views very much. It does have a lot of twists and turns, so be careful!",philangie6370
40,Difficult to follow the road all the way,"The views of LA from the eastern end of the road are fantastic, and I recommend everyone to stop at the first stop, overlooking the Hollywood Bowl. One the western end of the road, in the Ventura county, the road is called Ventura Hwy, and there are some views down to the ocean in addition to the most twisty (and fun) section of road that I've ever driven. The middle sections of the road provide nice views, but I'm not sure that I'd place this drive in my top ten in the US. One problem that I ran into was that the road is apparently a closed off dirt trail for a section, just east of Topanga Canyon Road. Google maps wasn't very clear about that, so if you are trying to drive the whole road, be sure to investigate a bit.",z28colt
50,Stunning views,"Great views, especially on a night. Lots of spots to stop for views, lots of nice expensive hones. The road is a little treacherous as not many street lights and very bendy so drive slowly",MarcWins
50,Amazing experience!!,A must do if you want a view worth watching and it's all for free if you have a car. You must do this if you're a tourist in LA.,Zabi H
50,Beautifully Breathtaking,"How beautiful it was to drive up this mountain and see LA, the Hollywood sign, and some beautiful rich homes. The beauty and bounty of our Lords creations can be experienced and seen first hand in the lucious mountainous view!",Cat V
40,Over The Top,When you drive up one of the canyon roads (which you should do carefully) you get to the top of the Hollywood hills. When I go to the Valley I sometimes take the route that takes me to Mulholland Drive. When I am the driver I try not to look at the incredible vistas.,Jeremy T
50,AMAZING VIEWS,Unbelievable views of the city! The view points to stop at are just amazing! You get so many beautiful views of the city along this drive. An absolute must when visiting LA,lynseyb34
40,Great views,"Historic drive & the views were amazing, some great vantage points to take in the city. Great way to kill a bit of time & see the city from a different view",lasqueezee
20,Not much worth seeing,"I was a bit surprised at how uninteresting a daytime drive along central Mulholland Drive was. The pavement's in fairly bad shape, and if one's the only person in the car, one needs to be watching the twisting road, not the scenery. The Nancy Pohl overlook was okay, but it faces north, not south over the city. In balance: not worth the effort -- enjoy the Pacific Coast Highway, instead.",kay-cee-1138
50,scenic view,there is no better way to see LA and the valley than this road. it goes through the mountain and each turn is a new surprise. beautiful houses as well/,Parvatee37

40,Great view..,"I like driving around Californian it feel so peaceful. And the view goes on and on, so many nice trees and mountain view.",widelyne b
50,A scenic drive not to be missed..,This drive takes you along the topmost ridge in the Hollywood Hills with fantastic views from numerous viewpoints over Burbank and its surrounding cities to the North and over LA to the South. In addition the highly twisting and undulating route is a driving experience in itself. Not to be missed!,DavidHBlair
50,Beautiful,Love this road. Is great ay to get across town and is usually quite empty. We live very near Mulholland but I am in awe every night when the valley lights twinkle. My kids tease me because I always tell the to look at the beautiful valley when we drive home.,travelingworkingmom
30,Great Views,Nice Views - but after awhile gets kind of boring looking at closed gates. Very Nostalgic. Great Views of other side of Hollywood Hills,NeedRelaxin
50,Go there !,"What a great drive, what a lovely, peaceful atmosphere ! Rinse your eyes with flowers and trees, beautiful houses, amazing architectural styles, winding roads, ENJOY and stop whenever you feel for an outlook. Just beware of the parking patrol, I actually saw a car being towed, how aweful is this for the owner ?",Karin T
40,Beautiful Drive!,"A very scenic drive with the view of Hollywood Sign which is not too far. If you want to take a picture of LA skyline, this is one of the best spots. This drive also goes through a lot of gorgeous houses and estates.",Tanzir M
50,Awesome views!,"No one should come to LA on a clear day and miss this drive. It's better for the passengers than the driver, though, as the road makes many twists and turns. Local drivers tend to tailgate, so just pull over and let them go on by!",SDBeachGuy
40,Good scenic route,"Twist and turn on a two way street ... exhilarating but worth the drive if you are visiting LA. There are few spots where you could see the Hollywood sign and take good panoramic photos of LA's skyline.I did the trip on a day time, but I bet views are pretty even during the night.",crankypedaler
30,A good drive,It is a good drive which provides a good view of some of the Hollywood related attractions of the city eg the Hollywood sign,smhr
40,Mulholland By Detour - Surprise Drive!,"Just flew to LA, got detoured and ended up driving through Mulholland Drive due to the LA Marathon two days ago. The detour/LA Marathon were not on the GPS - imagine that! Frustrated drivers were everywhere. Finally, we stopped at the Laurel Canyon Market for a break and saw a mural on the side of the building. This large, cartoonish map of the area had Mulholland Drive at the very North/top of the map. With this, my husband took me on this beautiful Mulholldand drive. Viola! We ended up right where we wanted to be - must learn to appreciate those detours!Amazing how a detour can take you to a place you've known about, wanted to see and kept skipping. Well, it is a beautiful drive - detour or not. Now we're going back to the little market to buy refreshments for a stop on one of the many turn outs so I can photograph the beauty in LA I'd never seen. Other trip advisors have written dusk and night are equally beautiful. So, I'm on my way, with driver husband and camera.We've been to LA/Beverly Hills so many times over the years and family and the beach are priorities. Thanks to trip advisor asking ""what else have you visited?"" I wouldn't haven't known to go back to Mulholland Drive in the evening. So, yes Mulholland Drive is a great drive. ""Smaller"" homes are hard to see because of the walls/gates. The drive is very narrow in places, and you do have to be careful for oncoming traffic. Overall, the views are worth the trip up, around and down Mulholland Drive. Just a big thanks to trip advisors who have written about this drive!",RikiUSA
50,Awesome drive! Spectacular views!,We must have hit the Mulholland Drive at just the right time as there was very little traffic! Fantastic views at every overlook of all the major Los Angeles sights. Loved every twist and turn on this scenic drive!,KaChHa
50,Brilliant views,"From the top of mullholland there is an area for cars etc to pull into, in summer it is very crowded. Best take one of the many bus tours that go there. The view is spectacular and you can see the hollwood sign a little closer too.",g1000_8
40,Love the view and history,"Yes, the views are incredible and the stories to go along are very interesting. Top down, wind in your hair drive through the curves and by the amazing home/mansions. Best if you go on a day after the wind blows some of the smog away..",664DavidK664

Include it on either a round trip through Santa Monica, Topanga and Hollywood or just drive up for the views.",MSH-Sussex
50,Magic View,"What an amazing view of Los Angeles and the Valley!Definitely a MUST visit spot while in Los Angeles.If you take Mulholland Drive towards the West from Fwy 101N, take a left on Cold Water Canyon and you'll end up in Beverly Hills thru Beverly Drive Pass!!! Then make a right on Brighton Way and another right on Camden Drive and Voila!!!!",BatiaandAleeza
50,Test your driving skills,"Mulholland twists and turns at the top of the hills in LA offering great views of the city below. There are several lookouts where you can see universal studios, the Hollywood Bowl and Hollywood sign, and downtown LA. The only downsides are the slow speed limit, slow drivers and terrible condition of the road surface.",PeterAZ
40,twists and turns,"beautiful drive. If you are afraid of heights, might not be the place for you. very twisty turny road, lots of places without guardrails. there are places to pull off and just stop to admire the view.",keekin
50,Cool road with views,"Cool drive to make the drive, but watch out for those who live there-they do tailgate. Road is only about 25-35mph, but the fancy cars like to drive much faster.

30,It was ok,"We just visited Mulholland drive yesterday with high hopes but found this drive just ok. There are many other drivers in USA (or in CA) which are more scenic. Also, there are another places from where you can get the view of LA from top. We have seen similar view of LA and other cities from different places so we were not so excited to see those views again after driving uphill for 30 minutes (from the bottom where the road starts). But many can find this drive scenic if they have never seen view of a metro city from top.Drive carefully and enjoy!",SrsRocks

40,Great VIew,"When in the LA area, one of the must do things is to take a drive up Mulholland Drive and look down over the LA basin. It is really a beautiful view.",Okie47
50,Best Way to get Scenic Photos of the City,"Mulholland Drive is very pretty and FREE. I'd suggest the stretch between Hwy 101 & Laurel Canyon Blvd is the best part if you are limited on time. Several places to pull off, park, and take photos. Including the Universal City Overlook and Hollywood Bowl Overlook which you can both find by searching Google Maps and putting a STAR on them as destinations. This street is fun for anyone including families!",Chad G
40,A great drive!,"I never did see the movie but Mulholland is worth driving along--great views, a great drive and a bit of fun. Try to look up who lives where to make it more interesting and do turn off some of the side streets like the Hollywood Hills and Bel Air. A bit of fun if you have time & are into that sort of thing.",Wanda6969
40,for a great view of LA,the road is all turns and seems like it never ends but the reward at the end is a very good view point of LA,marta b
30,Not Bad,"My husband and I drove down the street and the views are impressive but I wasn't overly thrilled with the experience. The road quality is terrible and you can really feel every bump and lump, also there didn't seem to be many places to stop and take pictures and regardless there's so much fog and pollution around the city it's all you can really see. It's something you should do in LA but I personally wouldn't do it again.",hotelier2407
50,A must-do drive!,"When I first moved to Los Angeles, Mulholland Drive was absolutely gorgeous to me and still is! The reason for this is because I am from Florida where there are no mountains.Mulholland Drive runs along the peak of the Santa Monica mountain range. From downtown all the way to the valley, the views are spectacular anywhere you drive. It is gorgeous at night and of course for a different perspective - during the day it is beautiful as well.",traveler4k
30,Nice drive - difficult to maneauver,"Mulholland Drive is a nice drive to make, but the roads are very, very narrow. If you are using a navigation system, you don't really have an address to point it to, so we spent a bit of time just getting started. Worth doing, but a hassle because of the narrow roads. I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad I did it once.",c685710
50,Amazing views of the Valley,"Hire a car and ride up Laurel Canyon Blvd until you hit the intersection with Mulholland Drive, then take a left. Follow Mulholland along the ridge and stop at the lookouts along the way. You need to take in the view from both sides of the ridge. One side looks over the San Fernando Valley into Burbank, Studio City etc towards Pasadena (I think!) and the other side looks down onto the Hollywood Hills, Beverly Hills etc. Beautiful.",JeromeMaz76
50,Great scenic drive,"We drove the entire length of Mulholland Drive making many stops at scenic overlooks. The drive was well worth it for the gorgeous views and the amazing atmosphere. We had a convertible rental car, which made the experience even better.We stopped at the Hollywood Bowl overlook, the Universal City overlook, and a couple others. You don't need to stop at every overlook, but each one gives a different view.",radx4

50,Free and Fun!,"Driving along Mulholland Drive is a must for a visit to LA. Some of the views are amazing and it's also a pretty convenient (lighter traffic) route across town. It may not be the most exciting activity, but it's free and there are a number of places to pull off and snap some pictures of the amazing views.",Shawn M
40,A nice drive in a fun car,"Took the 2014 Mustang convertible for a nice drive from the 405 to the Hollywood Fwy. Fun drive and nice views of the valley and the city. Hollywood Bowl overlook is a must see, but it does get crowded and there is not much parking.",Gary C
40,Pleasant Escape From The Freeways,"This was my third trip to LA, but my first time to visit Mulholland Drive. It will not be my last. Mulholland is a two lane road that winds across the tops of the mountains between Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and the Valley. The views are spectacular, and it is fun to see how the rich live. I drove Mulholland from the 101 freeway to the 405 in mid-morning. I would recommend this so that you can drive slowly, avoid the traffic, and enjoy the experience. People in LA drive fast so expect to get tailgated, and you will probably have to pull of the road often to let them pass.Along the way you will pass the Laurel Canyon Dog Park, and the Coldwater Canyon Park which is managed by the Tree People and has great hiking. At one vista point you can look down into the Hollywood Bowl, and see the Capitol Records building. For me it was a pleasant escape from the freeways, and a nice way to spend a morning.",John C
20,Give it a miss,"We spent an endless time in traffic and found the drive disappointing. Some nice houses but not many visible from the road. Lots of bars and security guards and a very closed in feel. We stopped in one of the vista points and were amused by the sign. No firearms or bow and arrows, perhaps they are scared that there might be a reincarnated Robin Hood lurking somewhere. Not worth the hassle of sitting in endless traffic, nicer things to do.",Maureen H

50,Best Enjoyed at Night,"During any Holiday I enjoy the Outdoors more than an Attraction. I enjoyed my drive all the way. Though you can enjoy it in Daytime, But in my case I deliberately drove in the Night. The views of LA at Night were amazing , you can see the city Glittering during the nighttime. there is also less (almost negligible) crowd during the night. Best time is around 9-10 pm. many movies have also shot night scenes of LA from here. loved it.",Sharnjit_Sondh
40,Worth the Great Views,"We drove the entire length. Many great views and places to stop to take pictures. Some interesting houses. Be aware there is no commercial space (at one stop there was an ice cream truck--that's it) on this street, no public rest rooms, shops etc. Just views and picture stops and scenery. Smoking is prohibited too according to many signs due to fire hazard concerns in such a wooded area.",SBFINCT
30,A lot of time for a decent view,"If you want to see a good view for free, this is the way to go. But, if you have money to spend and only so much time to do other things, you might pass on this. You may end up spending an hour round trip, mostly driving in sort of nice but not amazing neighborhoods, to take pictures at a view from a hill. Its can be a long drive and is kind of out of the way of other attractions, and the view is of a part of LA that includes some mixed residential and commercial and office buildings that is not too incredible. I enjoyed the view from the Getty Center hill better, and there is other stuff to do there.",Marc C

I've lived in LA for sixty months and still frequently drive this legendary street which stretches across the top of the mountains providing a view of the city, primarily the valley, with a breathtaking and at night almost spooky view of the sprawling landscape.

50,Great drive,"Very pretty views along this very twisty road. A nice drive if you have time. Locals that know the road drive pretty fast, we would move out of their way to let them pass.",mcalbreeze
30,Some Interesting but Generally Obscured Views,"We drove Mulholland Drive from the 405 to the end at the 101 and found that most of the expensive homes were set too far back and obscured by walls and/or landscaping for a good view. Most of the views from the pull outs are of the San Fernando Valley and were quite obscured by a lot a haze; the classic views of LA and the Hollywood sign are only from the couple eastern most pull outs at the very end of the road and again the views were quite hazy but still worthwhile in this case. Also near the eastern end is Runyon Canyon Park that has some nice short hikes to viewpoints but parking is very limited and finding a spot to park and get out is quite difficult. The road is also difficult to follow around Franklin Canyon and it is very easy to make a wrong turn as we did. My recommendation, and if I were to visit again, would be to visit the eastern viewpoints near the 101 with their wonderful classic views of downtown LA and maybe the eastern most view of the valley at night or after a weather front when the haze is not obscuring the view and not to bother with the rest.",Steve5863
40,You may find yourself in awe,"If you have the time and wish to see how some folks live, this is a street you do not want to miss. It's worth the drive to see beautiful homes plus try to look through massive privacy bushes meant to keep people from seeing the well kept homes.",wkrupa
50,Epic dream come true,"I am a great lover of films and the whole Hollywood experience was one of the greatest of my life.

40,Amazing View,"We took Mulholland from around Westwood to a vineyard in Malibu. The drive takes you a lot higher in elevation than you would expect. The views are fantastic and you feel like you aren’t in Los Angeles anymore. The change in scenery is such a surprise as it suddenly gets very green and you have the city on one side and the ocean on the other. It’s always been suggested to me to cruise Mulholland. I wouldn’t go out of my way, but if you are on the way north from LA then why not?",HanKelly

50,OMG We're going to die!,"All ramps to the interstate were closed late last Friday night, and we found ourselves trapped on Hollywood Blvd. along with hundreds of other cars. After five changes of the light and we did not move an inch, we knew we had to change direction. Travelers from out of state, we didn't even know about Mulholland Drive until we sought alternate routes on the GPS. What a trip it turned out to be. That is possibly the longest I have ever held my breath in a car. Beautiful overlook scenery and nail-biting curves with what appeared to be sudden drop offs. Take the trip- I dare you.",Yeahbut246

Stunning views and places to stop. Don't take this drive with someone who doesn't want to do it, because they could ruin the fun! DO take this drive with someone who is a great driver! It winds and twists and turns and is incredibly fast! People ride your bumper on the road! (For added fun, study a map to the stars homes! You'll only see a wall or a ling driveway, but just knowing you are there is great fun!). Besides, Google maps can give you a great view of the actual homes from the privacy of your own home! Keep your eyes open for the security trailer outside the home of a couple of BIG stars. You'll see what I mean when you seem it!",Kelly
30,Nice Views,"The Drive offers nice views but the roadway is terrible. For the amount of money that lives up there, at least pave the road.

If you have a clear day, which can be tricky in LA, then the view is incredible, decent Hollywood sign pictures from here as well. It's very busy up here as endless buses pull in to give tourists a view so I don't think you can spend a considerable amount of time here.

50,"Beautiful, Free, Fun","There is a reason the Holllywood tours all head up on Mulholland. We had a rental car and did ourselves and loved the drive!We mad the drive practical by using Mulholland after the WB tour and heading through the Hills to the Getty Center. We stopped at the first overlook near the 101 which was fantastic! Great views with the LA skyline and sprawling city in the background. This stop also had really good views of the Hollywood sign that everyone wants to see. You're also standing right above the Hollywood Bowl which many were interested in seeing. If you don't want to make the whole drive, just stopping at this point above the Hollywood Bowl is worth your time.The rest of the drive winded through the Hills with continued nice views of LA and the San Fernando Valley on the other side. The drive gave you a vibe for the city. Some beautiful houses - though I'm sure many, many that were not visible or accessable. Still worth it.The heights of the drive was not concerning. Keeping your eyes on the road was more difficult because it's easy to gawk. Also, it's not a scenic byway - it's a road in LA which means people are driving fast and want to get somewhere. But that's why they have overlooks for people to pull over and take as long as they want.",ICNiT
40,Glorious View,"Pull into the overlook area, park your car and you can sit down on a boulder or two. This is a spot reserved for tourists, with a telescope available to check out the vast panorama in front of you. A wonderful spot that I always bring out-of-towners to. It never fails to impress.",junnyd2018

30,Don't try to do your on tour,We took our hire car around the area with maps of stars houses from our hotel.I wish we had paid for a tour. We did not learn anything other than these hoses have big gates and there are lots of dead ends in Beverley hills and Bel Air.,flowerpower_9
50,Spectacular views,"Don't visit Los Angeles without taking at least an hour to explore Mulholland Drive. We did this ride on Aug. 11, a beautiful summer afternoon when Warren Beatty and Annette Benning were having a party - security on the road and lots of cars. Do yourself a favor and research the area before making your trek - key off-roads, celebrity addresses, optimum look-out points with great views of the city, canyons and the ocean. Don't be afraid to let other cars go past, when you can find a good place to slide over. The locals are going to drive a lot faster than you'll want to... or should. This should be on every driver's bucket list.",PRqueen823
40,Check out the beautiful mansions on this drive,"Although this is a very beautiful drive and very famous, I think there are so many beautiful drives in this area it's difficult to make a distinction. In addition to the incredible views and overlooks, the homes on this drive are impressive. It is definitely one of the worthwhile things to do in Los Angeles.",nadomom2

Early in the morning on the way to Runyon Canyon to walk the dog I'll sometimes see coyotes. On a clear day the views over the valley are breathtaking and it's great to be up there at night time to see the lights spread out below.",Godbolt2000

40,LA must-do,"Mulholland Drive is something every visitor to LA must do. It gives you great views of the area, as well as the spectacular homes in the Hollywood Hills (those you can see that are not hidden by walls, trees, and gates). Several overlooks for us tourists to pull over. The locals do tend to drive a bit fast for such a curvy road. Watch out if you're crossing the street.",Debbie M
40,Don't go if you're nervous about heights.,"Mulholland Drive has gorgeous views but it is kind of a nail biter! If you don't mind white knuckling it around the multiple switchbacks and can relax, then you can enjoy the scenery and houses. There's lots of Hollywood history around Mulholland and Laurel Canyons. Rent a convertible and have fun!",CathRun
40,If you like canyon views...,Ok so I'm not a fan of driving on the side of a cliff so this isn't the best location for me. But there are some amazing views from the top.,MarketingDiva

50,Wonderful views for about 10 months in the year,"I live off Mulholland Drive, and I have never tired of the views. I love taking the drive from Studio City, all the way across the 405 freeway to the Encino end. Cycling looks lovely but the cars tend to go a little fast, and so probably not the safest route.",AudreyH8
50,Amazing Views,"Take a drive along Mulholland Drive and you will enjoy it. Many places to pull over and check out the view. In the East, you can combine a drive with a visit to a few wineries in the Malibu Hills.",prdx2222

40,"Excellent views on a curvy ""ridge road""","There are only a few places to safely park and get out of the car to look at the stunning views of the the Los Angeles 'basin', the San Fernando Valley, and the Santa Monica Mountains. Mulholland Drive winds its way along the crest of the mountains. While the road is generally well-paved and wide enough for everybody, it has a few sharp turns and dangerous drop-offs, so don't speed along and then gawk at the views, because you could wind up on the evening news.",Ralph K
50,Super view on the city,"Start your drive after visiting Hollywood. Road starts climbing from highway 101/170 and after ca 1-2 miles there is already this viewing area giving great view over Los Angeles and Hollywood Bowl.You can continue as long as you like (until 405 or further even), but I recommend to get down at Beverly Hills and continue sightseeing there.You do not see well the houses from the road, but even the film stars are humans, so let's respect their privacy.",mWrite

40,wow,"the views on this road are beautiful,no question, but the elevation is scary and the road is so narrow if you have a problem with heights or anything like that it may be a problem..I have migraines and the elevation set it off. there are a few points to stop and lookout at but you may have to drive by them and back to see because if people are behind you there is no stopping...the road is extremely windy and narrow. we didn't take a guided tour which may be better but we had a map and did our own thing.",NyTravlgirl
50,Wow!,"This is a drive that you'll never forget. Just don't get going too fast - there are curves with steep dropoffs from the outside lanes. If you're driving, don't try to rubberneck. Keep your eyes on the road and let your passengers take in the scenery. And don't let your downhill speed build up too much, as you will need good brakes if you get surprised coming around a blind curve.... Your passengers will all get a real thrill from his drive - but you will need to keep your mind on your driving.

Take the road west through some of the most expensive real estate in Southern California, with architectural touches from Europe, Asia and Outer Space. Mulholland is actually the ridge road on top of the mountain that separstes in Los Angeles basin from the San Fernando Valley. The views to both sides can be had along the way in many pull-off spots, but remember that this is primarily residential areas so you may be on private property. Take Mulholland west to Topanga Canyon and then go left to Sunset and right on Sunset to the Ocean. Keep the top down!",Eddie L

50,A Drive to Remember,"If you have a car and some extra time during your stay in LA, the drive along Mulholland is a ""must-do"". My husband and I did the stretch of Mulholland between Laurel Canyon Blvd and the Hollywood Freeway (or Vine St). The views of LA and the canyons were breathtaking, and there were many spots along the way to pull off and enjoy the scenery. The drive is a very windy one, so take your time, keep your eyes on the road, and try to pull off to the side if you find yourself holding up someone behind you. There are also many parks along the drive, and I would recommend stopping at Runyon Canyon Park or Laurel Canyon Park, where the trails are excellent for walking or hiking, the views are amazing, and you may even spot a celebrity walking their dog.The drive up to Mulholland definitely got busy around 4 or 5pm on a weekday, so go early to avoid traffic.This nature and beauty in the middle of such a busy and populated city of LA is like an oasis in an urban jungle -- an LA ""attraction"" definitely not to be missed!",ajcaine09

The views from various vantage points were okay, though the smog made it less than ideal for photographs. Bottom-line I don't believe it was worth the effort even though we toured it on a motorcycle. Felt sorry for those, who had to pay a tour operator to be bused through the area. My apologizes, if I offended anyone.",DaPheonix
