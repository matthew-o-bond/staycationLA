50,Best Brewhouse atmosphere.,This is a place you can go and take your dog or other family member and enjoy a brew. They usually have food trucks out front if you want food.,Sheez1
50,Nice open air Kid/Dog friendly brewery,"Love this place! Right down the hill from our Socal apt in Signal Hill. Real chill place. Great beer, food trucks rotate for food. They allow kids and dogs in. Open air feel, so gets little chilly in cold weather. Did I say Great beer?",oahuhaole619
50,"Large seating areas, games, food trucks","The variety of beer is great, and the service was outstanding. Parking is fairly easy, depending on the time/day. The inside was clean, restrooms were clean, and it's dog-friendly.",Michelle B
50,"Their variety of beers are truly great, everyone is unique and full of flavor.","Ten Mile Brewing Co is the best craft beer brewery in all of southern California their variety of beers are truly great, everyone is unique and full of flavor. I ordered the Das Uncommon a Dunkel bock (6.6%) which happens to be my favorite beer here, and my friends tried the freshly tapped New England style Hazy IPA, I am not an IPA fan but my friends were really impressed with this ale. During our couple of hours here we also tried Hidden Hollow (5.2%) a Kentucky common that appears to be dark but drinks remarkably light, Maggie Mae (4.8%) a blond malty ale that is light refreshing, The Low Countries is a Belgian triple (8.9%) this is highly aromatic, with touches of spices, banana and even bubble gum, and Hop Exposure a double ipa (8,3%) very hoppy made from a blend of six hops and amounts of Cascade and Amarillo. If you have not been to this Brewery then go you will not be disappointed. All the staff are friendly and know their beer. For fine dining there is an independent food truck outside.TIP. Start with the blond and work your way up to the Belgian triple and an Uber ride home.",Michael B
30,Wear a Jacket!!,"No heat. Even though your ""indoors"" you must layer up. No food, except for mobile vendor parked in front. Flights are $10 for 4 tastes. Beer average. The best brews, in our opinion, were the Trail Marker ($7) and the Citrailenial Pale ($6.50). Place is spacious, but lacks ambience. Parking in front. Popular and worth a visit.",baaaaaaa
