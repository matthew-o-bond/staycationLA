40,Wine tasing and live music,"My lady friend and I had the wine sampler of 6 different wines, then choose to have a couple glasses of Chardoney. The night also featured a 3 piece acustic band covering the Stones and some music by the Killers, Tom Petty, The Doors, INX, U2 and other bands. They were very talented and we enjoyed the music but there could have been a little less volume.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonesk535
30,Live Music Is Great,"Nabu has good wine, but the price is high compared to other wines. Don't get me wrong, they make good wine, but I have tasted much better wine at lesser costs. For example, their Cab is around $80/bottle. It taste more like a $30 bottle and is comparable to a lot of other bottles I have had from both Napa and Paso.We like the winery, but think the value can be improved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikedAMDG
50,Very nice wine from Napa & Malibu,"First time visitors to NaBu on a Friday evening. Enjoy a flight & Malbec. Later on a food truck arrived; food was good. Later yet Live music, but we didn’t stay long enough to hear it. Next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommabeara
40,Business social,We were here for an after hours business celebration with about a 100 people.We were given a tasting card to taste several wines. We don’t drink so I can’t comment on the wines and it wasn’t my choice to go here since it was a corporate event.The food was fancy appetizers and then chicken and potatoes and veggies that were all really good.The atmosphere was nice and the owners and staff were all very friendly.They have an old album collection that they use to spin records which was cool for those of us that grew up with the 70s - 80s music.The front room is a tasting room with chairs and small tables and the back room has a few comfy chairs and sofa. There are also 2 nice clean bathrooms.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
50,"Good wine, great people",After visiting Malibu we decided to drive to Westlake Village to go specifically to that place and we didn’t regret it. I liked the fact that they offered wines from Malibu and Napa. The price for the tasting was very reasonable considering the quality if the wine they offer. We even had another glass after the tasting. The drive from Malibu is a scenic landscape,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/797christinar
40,A Perfect Rainy Day visit to Nabu Winery.,"This was our first visit to Nabu (Grapes from NApa, served in maliBU). We visited with our dog too who was equally welcome. What a great find, the wines and tasting menu were very good and great value. We ended up purchasing wines, some great Pinot Gris and Oak Barreled Chardonnay. We had a great time discussing the local Malibu wines and the regions of Napa that Nabu harvests for its own wines. We will most certainly be back, what a great way to spend a rainy afternoon in Malibu or a sunny one.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colinr848
