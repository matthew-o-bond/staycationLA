30,Not a lot here - but...,These are the remains of a coastal battery that had been armed with 'disappearing rifles' like those mounted on Corregidor. Basically just the concrete emplacements are left along with powder magazines which have some artifacts and a lot of old photos and newspaper front pages. Quite interesting if you are a military buff. Probably boring for most people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgny1fwd
40,Unusual on our coast,"Even though living in the Greater Los Angeles area all my life there are still things I haven't seen before one is Fort MacArthur Military Museum in San Pedro. It is basically next to the Korean Bell of Freedom which I have been to several times. There is all sorts of military memorabilia from World War II, gun emplacements, many military vehicles, newspaper front pages, bunkers, soldiers quarters with gear, and all supporting equipment. Interesting place to spend some time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormKeith
50,2.23.2019,"Had a great time, a lot of foods, lived airplanes, tank and firework action....restroom easy accessible and plenty of beauriful scenic to take pics",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
50,Hidden history gem,A little hard to find but worth it. We easily found the barracks and Korean Bell but no signage to the military museum was confusing. Fortunately we asked a Parks and Recreation employee for directions. Limited parking on street which works in visitor's favor reducing crowds. Parks and Recreation employees are extremely knowledgeable about the defensive position for past 100 years. The tour was great. Bookstore and relic military vehicles also on premises.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B4344DLtimh
50,WWII History and More,Made the drive over after visiting the Drum Barracks and ended up spending the afternoon walking around the museum and surrounding area. Wear comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking and most of it is not paved but dirt and grass. Be sure to check out the K9 cemetery on the grounds and near by Korean Friendship Bell.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
50,Coastal Military History,Good museum for a quick stop or a longer stay. The museum staff and volunteers are friendly and passionate about the history of Fort MacArthur. Walk through everything and ask question for the best experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSMullins
50,Military History,"Since I like old military historical places, this is right up my alley. I have been coming here for many years. It's nice to walk around and put yourself back in time when this was a functioning military base. Quiet a few movies have been filmed there. I hope one day the museum can acquire the gun for its show piece, just like the ones on the USS Missouri and on Corregidor Island in Manila.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esethebomb
30,quick stop but worth it if you like history,Spend the time reading the fine print. Did you know that a ship was actually sunk off our coast by a sub before Peal harbor? Check out how they defended our west coast to keep us out of the war.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fmattship
50,"A hidden gem, don't miss it!","So our destination was the Korean Bell next door, when I was looking at google maps and spotted Fort McArthur from the satellite view. It turns out it was closed for the day. There was a man working we talked to for a while about the fort. He was so nice and let us look around for a while. Everything in the place has been acquired by a nonprofit group that runs the place, so make sure you donate if you go visit. Great to see so much history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Conrad68
50,Hidden LA WWII Military History ...,"Who knew? Not too many back in the WWII days when West coast harbor defenses were guarded secrets, but Ft. McArthur's coastal artillery defense gun batteries are still here. Open only 12pm - 4-5pm on, I believe, Tues, Thurs & Saturday (better Google it) and well worth a trip to visit, for all ages. Nice small museum detailing the WWII aspects and display of artillery, vehicles, missles and memorabilia. Nice area to walk and explore. A Must for any history buff. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Great visit,My kids had a great time walking through this small yet amazing museum. The views from the top of the battery are great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400juanv
40,A Great Slice of My Military History,"By visiting the Fort MacArthur Museum with my wife, two fellow former Army musicians and a new Marine friend, I was able to experience a wonderful look into California military history. I was able to connect with a former Ft. MacArthur Army band member, and gain a couple of new veteran friends. I was a trumpet player in the 72nd Army band at Ft. Mac. from April, 1966 to August, 1967. We played a lot for both military ceremonies and public events. All staff members are volunteers. The Director/Curator, Steve Nelson, is a walking encyclopedia and perfect tour guide. The museum is open on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, from 12 noon to 5:00 p.m. Check the website for directions into the museum through the correct entrance gate. This great museum relies heavily on donations to operate and grow, so please consider supporting them in any way you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gelaffey
40,Fort McArthur,This is a small military museun that is located in an actual coastal gun placement to protect the LA coast and harbor. The museum has some great displays covering little known WW II events off of the Southern Calif. Coast and the great LA Air Raid. If you come the second weekend of July for the Old Fort Mac days there are lots of active displays and living history people camped portraying a time line from the Roman's to Viet Nam conflict. This is an excellent show.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/707clayg
50,Who knew all this Military coastal defense history was right here in our backyard.,Found this completely by accident after a trip to USS Iowa and was completely amazed. Walking the grounds of the old military coastal defense base the was once here and seeing the spots of the gig 16 inch cannons that were here guarding our shores. Exploring the underground magazines where the big 16 inch shells were stored and moved was really cool. Battery Osgood and Battery Farley are open to the public to freely walk through and explore. Donations are accepted for the upkeep of the museum itself. The grounds are a fantastic place to go for a walk and the views of the ocean are fantastic from the top of the hill. Great place to take your kids to show them up close the history of what once was here to defend the west coast of possible attack years ago... Very hands on and that's whats great nothing behind glass and kids of all ages love that. There are several old trucks and a Nike surface to air missile underground that are really cool !!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsK1099DH
30,Small but interesting fort,"This is a small but interesting fort/museum to visit in San Pedro, CA. It is hard to find though. There is signage at the entrance but from there it is difficult to find as there are multiple roads with no signs indicating which way to turn. But once you do it's pretty cool to visit. It is small and free. There is an underground museum that gives you the history of this fort along with pictures, old tanks, jeeps, artillery, etc. There are hills to climb to get to the top of the fort that overlooks the ocean. It is a self paced tour and won't take more than 1 hour unless you read every placard in the museum. Lots of free parking. Uneven grounds, so wear comfortable flat shoes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lynette51
40,Very interesting outdoor museum,"If your a fan of military history, this place is for you. It is a small scale museum in the sense that: It is a self guided visit, no brochures, no docents to answer questions, no parking (park across at the high school/ mammal rescue center, but it's free. It is a nice piece of land next to the ocean with impressive military arms/ artillery, a K-9 cemetery, barracks, era cars and many articles. If you don't go into every little crevice you may miss out. There are a few entrances, but only one entrance is open on 32nd Street. You can cover the grounds, if you really take your time in approximately 1 hour or less; if you are pressed for time in 20 minutes. There is a single bathroom on the premises.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWind26
50,A piece of LA and California Military History,"This is a retired Army Coastal Artillery base. Up until the end of WWII, the big guns mounted in these forts were the first line of defence from attacks from the Pacific. Today, the grounds are a museum that is part of the LA County Parks system. This is one of the few intact gun positions left, and although the guns are gone, the rest of the installation is being lovely cared for by a group of volunteers. The grounds offers a great view of Catalina Island and some of the bases tunnels and interior spaces are open to the public. The gift shop has an interesting collection of military history books. It's a noce place for families, since there are nice lawns for kinds to run around in, while the military buffs explore the fort. Once per year, on the weekend after July 4th, a fundraising event is held were almost all of the local re-enactors gather to show off their skills, re-enact battles and generally have fun. Well worth visiting any time of year, but well worth attending the show in July. There are facilities, but they're fairly basic. Don't be afraid to ask any of the volunteers for help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TowpilotKen
40,Great Piece of History and special event in July.,"Totally Cool place. Lots of information and pictures within the Fort itself. I was there for Living History days in July which had re-enactors from almost every military period in history; from Romans to Cowboys. They wear the clothing/costumes, re-enact battles and have camps set up to tell you what life was like in their time period. Entry fee was $10 and what a great way to spend the day alongside the beautiful ocean. Wonderful experience for kids and adults alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindylove
