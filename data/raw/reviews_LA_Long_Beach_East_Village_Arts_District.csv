40,"OK to visit but didn't see much of an ""Arts District""","We had a good vegan lunch and found a big used record store that we enjoyed. However, as far as a district goes, not much to recommend it. Maybe if they put out a map giving some guidance to visitors it would help.",Robin T
40,Great place to visit to shop and dine,"This is a great little part of town. Whether you are looking for a good cup of coffee, a meal or to shop, you can find just about anything that you want here.",Alexander_Designs
30,I was disappointed....,"The shops were interesting, but very repetitive in nature. Almost all of them had overpriced used clothing. The only store I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND was the AIDs Thrift Store where there are very interesting items and appropriately priced for things that are used. I purchased two things here. It seemed that many people shopping on the street that day were from out of the U.S., so maybe these are novelty stores for tourists.",KathyAloha2013
50,Great Shops!,"Great specialty boutiques - crystals, plants, clothing, jewelry, antique furniture; and delicious restaurants!",jml821
30,"Cute, but not very big and stores have limited hours","I appreciate a street full of independent stores rather than generic chains...that is what this had. I also appreciated the outdoor public art (mosaic tiles, paintings, etc.) on the street. I just wish this was more than one block long. I also wish the shops didn't have rather limited hours, such as the shop that had all handcrafted stuff by local artists.",cchip55
50,LONG BEACH JUST KEEPS ON GIVING,Every corner you turn in Long Beach there is another little treasure to enjoy. The arts district is but one great example. The 3rd Thursday it comes alive with street musicians and people out and about. Little boutiques and discoveries abound.,SenorGancho
50,"Not quite the NY East Village, but artsy enough.","Having lived in the 90's East Village in NYC, this is a far cry! Why do they call it the East Village anyway?! But the food is decent (Utopia, Berlin) and shopping (Fingerprints) is a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Murals abound. Not sure it is a destination, but if you are in the area, have a stroll. Some good eats and shopping. Great murals. Nice architecture. Close to downtown and the beach.",travelingrules
30,Interesting stop,While you are in Long Beach you should explore the East Village Arts District and check out the gallerice and boutiques.,buffalojim67
10,What?,Is this a joke? Followed the map and drove the side streets and didn't see anything.Ended up on 4th at the Assistance League thrift store. If I lived here I would have bought all there furniture.,Sarah G

40,Small & safe area when you're on your own! Lots of nice places,"I had checked out various information on this area, and especially wanted to try some of the restaurants. I bus & walk (with a cane), so tried to find places with bus service. None where I wanted to go, except the main bus Gallery, so had about a 6-8 block walk. It was worth it! While I'm not a shopper, the restaurants I went to were great, the sidewalks clean, lots of tile work and benches to sit on. When I finished investigating here (took a couple hours, had to walk back to Pine Avenue to meet friends which was a several block walk,, but I still enjoyed it. I've been home 3 days now, still can't walk, but it was worth it, and I'm looking to doing it again, first chance I get.",lindalindabm

10,Boring not for someone California,There was nothing but regular stores. This is not a tourist attraction. I didn't even get out of the car,LIVElifeTravel2018
50,"Used to Be Better, But Still Solid",This is a great place to go chopping for mid century furniture and other items. Prices have recently risen due to the popularity of the era. However you can still find an occasional bargain here. There are several good restaurants down by the art theater which units on right is a nice place to see a great movie. This district will soon be on everyone's map when they visit Long Beach.,Jon M

50,Long Beach East Village Arts District,"The shops are amazing and carry the coolest items. It's like Melrose in Hollywood, but without the crowds and it's close to the beach! This area sells amazing furniture and clothes and many of these items are sold to movies and television shows that feature the 1950s and the 1960s. Great restaurants and just a nice place to browse. I live in Belmont Heights (I love Belmont Heights!) so it's just about 5 minutes away from my house. I recommend Long Beach to any tourist coming to So Cal. We have it all!",Pam C

50,this is where I live,"The reason I love the East Village Arts District is proximity to just about anything I need, the unique stores in the area, the fabulous restaurants and bars (special props to Utopia, District Wine, the Green House and Asha) and the ambiance of the area.

40,Interesting shops and cafes along Linden & Broadway street,"When I asked the front desk at the Renaissance hotel about the East village, they said it about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. There are unique clothing and second hand clothing shops here, such as Eleva8 and Brandon Apparel. These are interesting finds and they open after 10am. Eleva8 is thrift shop finds, scored some cool deals on accessories and blouses. Brandon Apparel has department store quality clothes for men and women but prices are very reasonable. The Utopia cafe has a unique world cusines menu, and offers indoor and outdoor seating. The Salon 500 offered reasonable blowdry and styles, and manicure and pedicure services.
