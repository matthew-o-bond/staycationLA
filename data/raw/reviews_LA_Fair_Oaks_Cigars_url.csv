40,Great Cigar and liquor selection,I like to smoke a good cigar periodically I found They have what I'm looking for. They offer a great selection of inexpensive to high end cigars.Fun environment on football playoff days they usually do like a pot luck party very fun but it does get a little smokey.,Dan Berry
50,One of a kind experience,"On most nights you can show up at Fair Oaks Cigar and find a dozen men (and women) sitting about in comfy chair, in a living room setting, chit-chatting and smoking cuban cigars. I came looking for cigar boxes for a classroom project and felt very jealous. Regardless of my distaste for the activity, I hung out for a good 20 minutes cuz these people were having a ball. Such a friendly atmosphere!",Erudite_journey
