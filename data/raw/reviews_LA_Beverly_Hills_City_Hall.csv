40,A beautiful architectural complex,The iconic City Hall tower is a beautiful icon of Beverly Hills and the new annex is also very pretty and easy to get around in.

50,Mythique!,"City hall is a very beautiful building that can be seen from the park but it's better to get up close. This 'monument' in Beverly Hill was also made famous in the movie Beverly Hills Cops with Eddie Murphey,but it served as the police headquarters in the movie.",happyinparistimestwo
50,Beautiful buildings,"You can appreciate the tower from Beverly Gardens across the road but following a previous review, I took a walk through the whole complex of striking city buildings with their lush courtyards.",mrdom

40,The whole 1930s Complex is a must see,Beverly Hills City Hall is a 1930s architectural masterpiece. Well worth a visit especially after spending time walking around Rodeo Drive. Even a walk around outside is impressive,Chinapjs
50,Style from a different era,Never been inside it but have passed it many times and stopped and admired it from the kerb. A stylish old building and so different to the crassness and materialism of newer buildings nearby.,RonWamberal
50,Worth a detour from shops on Beverly Hills,"If you want an antidote to the depressing materialism of Beverly Hills then walk a couple of blocks east from the centre to City Hall. It’s a beautiful example of 1930s architecture. Really impressive. Also walk through to the City Library, which is the most extraordinary civic library I’ve ever seen and provides a nice opportunity to escape the heat and there’s a coffee shop there too.",TomGSt_Albans
50,From George Vreeland Hill,Beverly Hills City Hall is home to the Beverly Hills City Council and many city departments.It is the heartbeat of Beverly Hills.A beautiful building that dates back to the 1930s.A must-see place when visiting Beverly Hills.George Vreeland Hill,George Vreeland Hill
