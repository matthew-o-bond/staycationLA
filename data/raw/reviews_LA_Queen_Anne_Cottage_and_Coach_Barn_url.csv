50,Romantic Historic Architectural Gem in Unexpected Setting,"Situated on the expansive grounds of the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanical Garden in Arcadia, take time to closely inspect the exterior of the lovely Victorian Queen Anne Cottage on the shore of Baldwin Lake. The historic Baldwin Cottage was built during 1885-1886 as a honeymoon present from Elias Jackson ""Lucky"" Baldwin for his fourth wife, sixteen year old Lillie Bennett, having been designed by architect Albert A. Bennett, Lillie's father. Unfortunately, the couple separated in 1885, the year following their marriage, at which time Mr. Bennett converted the romantic cottage into a memorial and tribute to his previous wife Jennie Dexter, who had passed away in 1881. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Hollywood notables have enjoyed this property; those familiar with ""Fantasy Island"" will find themselves exclaiming ""de plane!; de plane!"" upon their approach. Gorgeous setting, do walk the surrounding porch and admire the architectural details and stained glass on the cottage. Nearby, the high quality Victorian Coach Barn interior is accessible and should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimGTravels

50,Family time,"It was amazing to hang out with my entire family. Great pictures but, mainly, unforgettable moments!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/79patyg
50,Beautiful Cottage,"I loved seeing this house, so prominently featured in the old TV show, Fantasy Island. I was disappointed that you couldn’t go inside but you could look through the windows, which was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Manazefa
40,Historic,"Located by a large pond on the grounds of the Los Angeles Arboretum, these historic structures provide a glimpse into simpler times. They are not everyone's cup of tea, however. I took my 20-something Australian cousin since his family origins are from here, and he was just bored.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Lovely,"The house is only open at certain times, however, you can look in the windows & admire the gorgeous furniture daily. They also have patio furniture in strategic spots on the veranda, so you can sit and enjoy the gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tylottama
30,Smaller than expected,I think the place is charming and worthy of a visit—if you happen to be there. It is not big and visitors usually do not get to see inside except for a few days of the year.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/979dianem
40,"Part of LA County Arboretum & Botanic Garden, a jewel in Pasadena","Wow, what a beautiful place. This 1870s home, barn, and former homestead is in the middle of sprawling LA County Arboretum & Botanic Gardens. It's a beautiful place to visit. The home has been furnished with period furniture and holiday decorations and there are set times when you can tour inside. You can always view from the outside windows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RhettL905
50,The heart of the Arboretum!,A truly remarkable bit of local history - reminding us of the time when all this area was in the hands of a few ranching familes. Great place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CharlesC1296
40,First time visitors,"This was our first visit at the L.A. County Arboretum. We were especially interested in seeing the Queen Anne Cottage & Barn - which were gems BUT you can't go into the cottage. As we understand, it's only open twice a year. You can look in all of the windows & take pictures but it's not the same. I would have given it a 5 star review if we could have gone inside the house. It's really well maintained. The house is furnished beautifully and it's a real gem. I hope to see it fully sometime. The barn is worth looking at as well. All the original saddles etc are there as well as a very fine wagon. It's quite a walk - beautiful and worth it. Have lunch at their little cafe. We did and it was very nice. The desserts looked wonderful.The plants and waterfalls are just fantastic. I wish I lived closer - what a place to walk!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/58Lister
40,Lovely Building in spectacular surroundings,"When you travel around L.A and see that most people live about 10 feet from their neighbor's house, this wonderful place reminds you that it wasn't always like it is noe. Granted, the cottage and carriage barn have been moved, but they always had lots of beautiful space around them. There are times you can't access the house, but you can usually look in all the windows from the wrap around porch",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKT0707
50,QUEEN ANNE COTTAGE AND COACH BARN,"I LOVE the arboretum!!! There is so much to see. I have been a member for the past four years. It is worth the cost. It is close by, so sometimes I go for a quick walk, In the past, you could have mini picnic but I now see a sign that states they don't want you eating here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCLCP
40,Local film location,"I also wrote how great the Los Angeles County Arboretum was to visit. This is just one of the great things inside the arboretum. The Queen Anne Cottage was built by Lucky Baldwin ( one of the three great railroad barons of the west) to entertain his guests. Lucky never lived in the cottage! The nearby barn housed his horses, and is a marvel unto itself. Still used for movie backdrops, and many wedding photos, this is a moist see near Los Angeles. Yes, it was the structure used in the Tv program Fantasy Island, but it is so much more. ADA accessible by an elevator on the north side of the cottage. Be sure yo stop and look inside fro a great example of post Victorian decor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryI428
50,History buff excitement,Thoroughly enjoyed the coach house (thankfully which was opened). The cottage wasn't open but still enjoyable to peer in through the windows into each room and to walk along the wrap around porch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global415549
50,Local history; the Arboretum's Queen Ann Cottage and Coach Barn,"Although you can always walk around these two sites, they are only open limited days. Be sure to check the calendar. The Los Voluntaries give the tours of the inside which are fascinating.. Well worth visiting and doing lunch at the Peacock Cafe",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamePeg
50,Quite Interesting!,"Queen Anne Cottage is located inside the L.A. County Arboretum & Botanical Garden, and it's definitely worth paying a visit to, when you're strolling thru the Arboretum. It's got a lake in front of it, with ducks and fish in it...the cottage itself dates wayyyy back and it's interesting to peep through the different windows to see how things were back in the days...all I can say is that I'm happy I'm living NOW and not back then....lol. Oh...for those of you that remember the TV show ""Fantasy Island"" with Ricardo Montalban...it was filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
50,"Well worth a visit, children included.",This is part of the Arboretum and one of the main attractions of Arcadia (next to Santa Anita Race Track).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/no1popz
50,Visit Southern California like it was in the 1800's,"The Queen Ann Cottage has been restored to it's 1800's splendor amidst the beauty of the L.A. County Arboretum and botanical gardens. Of course you had to be rich in those days and a friend of ""Lucky"" Baldwin to visit the Cottage, but now, anyone with $5.00 can come and spend the day walking the grounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/David_DeMulle
50,Wonderful Historic Buildings!,When you visit the Los Angeles County Arboretum be sure to see the Queen Anne Cottage and tropical surroundings. Inside were numerous Christmas trees and decorations that gave the cottage a very special feel.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoLorenzo
40,Great sculptures and succulents,"If it wasn't so dry this would be a wow place.Larger than I thought.We, all enjoyed the waterfall. After the walk through the dry,dusty gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1SueDu
30,Beautiful Victorian Buildings.,"It is nice to see these buildings which tell the story of Lucky Baldwin who had a large part in the development of the San Gabriel Valley and his contributions to the growth of the area. Unfortunately you cannot go in the Queen Anne Cottage as it would be a great experience. The Coach Barn is open with a beautiful carriange and other important artifacts. Also, the adobe building that Lucky Baldwin actually lived in is undergoing renovation at this time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Beautiful History,What a beautiful piece of history right here in Arcadia. Not only a lovely historical home but it has also been used in several movies. For those of us old enough to remember Fantasy Island you will recognize this beautiful building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/464betsyl
50,One of the best sights in the Arboretium,"The Queen Anne Cottage is a reward for exploring the Los Angeles Arboretum. As a kid we felt we were exploring the jungle and then the cottage would appear.Others might yell ""the plane, the plane' after the long forgotten scene in ""Fantasy Island' that was filmed there.Well worth the walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Fascinating historic house tour,"We saw this tour on the Arboretum's website and thought it sounded interesting. Boy, was it ever! Coming from San Francisco, I was embarrassed to say that I didn't know who Lucky Baldwin was and how important he was to San Francisco and to Pasadena/Arcadia! What a character! He owned the property that is now the Arboretum and had this really cool and interesting Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn built on it. The buildings are amazing for their architecture, but the stories about Luck Baldwin were riveting! He also built the Santa Anita racetrack across the street. And with 4 wives during his lifetime, he was quite the character, especially when compared with the proper citizens of neighboring Pasadena! These buildings use to be open only once a year, now they are open for guided tours every week! You have to check it out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SF_AlexK
