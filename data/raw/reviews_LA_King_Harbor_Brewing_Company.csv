30,Great Location Brews OK,Very Friendly and great location for a brew at sunset. My tractor man is a homebrewer and really only found one beer that he thought was good which was the stout.Try a sampler and you decide.,SS_Forever
50,Beach brews are the best brews,"My fiancé and I stopped in here after spending some time walking around the Redondo Beach Pier. We'd heard Naja's had a TON of options but being from out of town we just really wanted to try something local. And they had $5 happy hour pints. So SCORE.The setting is super laid back, kind of intimate so I can imagine it getting crowded on a summer weekend but perfect for a casual weeknight drink. There are a few stools facing the water but you get the ocean breeze no matter where you are. There's cool ocean-inspired art and the table tops are made from the tops of barrels. Such cool attention to detail.I got the South Bayern, a Bavarian Hefeweizen that was super refreshing and flavorful for a hot summer day. My fiancé got the St. Jameson, an Irish Dry Stout ages in Irish whisky oak. As a big whisky drinker, he was impressed. We also got a 5oz. taster of the Greyscale Coffee Stout because we both love Bent Paddle Cold Press. It was a great balance of coffee flavor without being too bitter, but I'm glad we did a taster to split because I don't know if I would want to do a full pint.For snacks, expect bags of chips and jerky. So nothing to write home about but they're also pretty reasonably priced for a beachside brewery.The service was great too. Super friendly beer tender without being too attentive or pushy. You know the type.They have a great variety of beers so any beer palate. A definite must when in the Redondo Beach area.",Bethany Scribner

50,"Great spot to chill, people watch, and take in the peaceful harbor","I'm sitting at the King Harbor tasting room right now as I write this, enjoying a freshly brewed batch of Coconut IPA, listening to some great tunes, and enjoying the warm California afternoon. A great spot to chill with friends or decompress on your own (as I am doing now!). Try the awesome bagged nuts they have (my fave are the cajun flavored ones)",rayrayinLA
50,Fun Place Right on the Boardwalk,"It's was a beautiful Father's Day and we stopped in for some tasters. The place is fun, has a variety of beers, and is doing great business, My wife & I preferred the non-Belgian style beers, e.g., ""Sink with Caliornia"" & the ""Shaka People Blonde."" Fun time.",Billyjoe52
40,A brewery taproom right on the boardwalk!,"I've been to a plethora of breweries in my life, but I had yet to find one in so ideal of a locale as the Redondo Beach pier. The room is crowded and cozy, and the offerings are the usual staples of California craft beer culture. I even bought a growler to show my approval.",orange-u-tall
50,Probably the only place worth visiting on the pier....,"We walked down to the shoreline, which was awesome.. saw a dolphin swimming in the waves on the way to the tasting room. My girlfriend got a mango ipa that was from the last keg they had of it.. Something about it being the last makes it taste even sweeter. I had an IPA, and we split the coconut IPA, which was awesome. The coconut doesnt hit u right away, it's more of an aftertaste. HIghly recommended after a walk on the beach/boardwalk... you might want to bring food with you, the B rated establishments up and down the lane have been known close due to outbreaks of food poisoining/and pest infestations... but the beer should be pretty safe, it's got alcohol in it after all. 5 dollar happy hour on all beers makes for a pretty sweet deal.",Justin P
50,Craft Brewery Tap Room right on the boardwalk,"Nice little tap room right on the International Boardwalk. Open air bar is great for people watching while you sample the beers they make at their brewery a few miles east (182nd street near Hawthorne Blvd). Good selection of beer types for all palates. Only snacks are sold on premises, but lots of food available on the boardwalk and they don't mind you bringing it in if you are drinking their beer.",misterjohnny
