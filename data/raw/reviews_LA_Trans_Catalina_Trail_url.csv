40,A very challenging hike!,"Catalina has very scenic vistas and very satisfactory campgrounds, but lack of shade and thethe vertical challenges makes this a challenge to even the most experienced hikers. The experience in totality was great, but make sure you are prepared for the sun and some serious elevation variations. The buffalo tacos at the Catalina Airport are great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/401RichardH
50,Amazing! But AMAZINGLY DIFFICULT - what I wished I had known.,"Just returned from completing the trail on Mother's Day weekend 2019. I read quite a bit before we made our reservations and hiked the trail, but there were still things I wished I had known.1) Hiking Permit is now electronic - just save it on your phone or carry a paper copy (no one asked to see it)2) It was well worth it to stop and camp at Little Harbor!3) The showers: Hermit Gulch has coin operated Hot showers. The shower house closest to the Ranger station has appropriate water pressure. The other is a trickle. It takes a minute or two for the water to turn hot. Black Jack/Little Harbor/Two Harbors campgrounds have only a pole (no privacy) with cold water; think of the showers at the beach to rinse the sand off! Parson's Landing - no showers.4) Definitely stop where you can to eat. It is less food to carry. Airport & Two Harbors have places to eat.5) The safest way to complete the leg of the trail from Two Harbors to Parson's Landing is to take the West End road out to Parson's Landing and then hike the overland trail back to Two Harbors. The trail is crazy steep in parts of the 2 miles from Parson's to the top, but it is doable. It is then 4 miles down to Two Harbors from the top. Yes, you did read correctly from other reviews that there are no switchbacks! I'm not sure how you come down the steep sections if you came from Two Harbors overland to Parson's! We ran into a Ranger at the top who told us that they prefered to hike the overland trail the direction we were doing it from Parson's to Two Harbors vs. Two Harbors to Parson's. Now we know! Also there is no shame in taking the West End Road both directions. The other groups that hiked at the same weekend all took the West End Rd both directions.What is not on the map is that there is a new covered picnic table near the top, but no vaulted toilet on this section of the trail.6) There are coin operated hot showers in Two Harbors. They even provide shampoo/conditioner and soap! The bathrooms are clean! I would recommend taking a shower before heading to the Two Harbors Campground because . . . it is uphill!7) There is potable water along the trail at identified location, rest covered picnic tables and vaulted toilets. Still good to carry more than 1 litre of water, despite the weight. I didn't think that 3 litres is needed unless it is really HOT or you drink ALOT.The hike is difficult! It is worthwhile.We took 4 days: Day 1: Avalon to Blackjack; Day 2: Blackjack to Little Harbor; Day 3: Little Harbor to Parson's Landing; Day 4: Parson's Landing to Two Harbors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleK786
40,"Very hard, beautiful family hike, great views","This hike is gorgeous! It is also really, really hard and should not be taken lightly.My family enjoys hiking, does it often, and I would rank the 4 of us as fit for a middle age couple, and super fit for our 12 & 14 year old.We took a shuttle to the airport, had a nice meal, and hiked back to Avalon in 1 day. Distance 11.5 miles. The first ~6.5 miles are extremely hard - constant up and down w/ ~1700 feet of incline. The next ~2.5 miles were pleasant. At that point we took the road long, steep road down into town.Saw buffalo, a fox, hawks, squirrels, countless wildflowers.We went on a mild day (mid 60s) in March after the most rain in years, and it was green and lovely. Spectacular views everywhere you look!But again - this hike is very, very hard. If I would have truly known how hard it was, I probably would have done something else - we are hikers, but not particularly on a hiking vacation. So I am telling you the truth 😉 - there is no shade. There are almost no breaks, it is up and down nearly the whole way. If you do it, do the usual smart things - sunblock, water, solid footwear, etc.As a point of reference, my spouse and teenager recently hiked 72 miles on the High Sierra Trail, and they both thought this was very hard. We also all enjoyed it.Happy trails!! 🥾",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stephaniecL5392VH
50,"Challenging, beautiful and remote but not too remote","A quality backpacking trip for all, but especially for beginners who are a bit nervous about leaving civilization. Since you pass by Airport in the Sky and Two Harbors, you aren't all that far from civilization but out on the trail you feel like it! It's also nice to rent a kayak in Two Harbors. Since the island is mostly a preserve its quite pristine. Elevation gains are large but the views are worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tmwalsky
50,"Views,Wild Life,Sand,Surf All Across Catalina",Easy 37.2 mile trail across Catalina. This trail has fantastic vista views along a well planned out rolling path.Camping is situated every 8-10 miles. Plan a head and reserve space.Watch out for vechiles traveling the same roads in many places. Slow done and move over or get dusted.Bring plenty of water. It is hot and dry desert like on the trail with few places to refill your water supply. Consult Catalinaconservancy.org for detailed conditions and permits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BluewaterGypsy
30,Two Harbors to Parson's Landing: VERY tough,"We attempted to backpack the section of the trail from Two Harbors to Parson's Landing. So we were doing this with 35-40 lb backpacks--I'm sure it's easier with day packs, but even without this trail is STEEP.This section of the trail was marked as ""moderately strenuous"", but it was extremely difficult and mislabeled. We are from Denver, hike a lot, and backpack quite a bit at much higher elevations and this was too much. The trail is difficult because it goes straight up inclines for multiple miles: no switchbacks or flat sections to recover. The view is nice, but there is also very little shade and since the elevation gain is so steep, you quickly lose those cooling ocean breezes.After about two miles, we called it quits and got to Parson's Landing via the West-End Highway: much easier, beautiful views, and flat all the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelw211
50,"Nice trail, multiple skill levels, sectioned","My wife and I have never hiked. We hiked a portion of this trail during our stay in Two Harbors. Some parts were rough, but not impossible. We are not in shape, either. We did the leg from Goat Whisker's Trail end to Goat Whisker's Trail beginning including the Goat Whisker Trail. This hike shows on papers to be about 3-4 hours; we stopped at regular intervals and took our time, completed in 5 hours. We would not have been able to do more hiking that day; took all we had, but worth it. Goat Whisker Trail portion is very difficult due to steepness- goes up to 1500 feet at one point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adcjones
30,A Seasoned Catalina Man Hits the TCT,"First-off, a caveat and some revealed biases. As a So. Cal. resident, I love Catalina and have been out there about 3-4 times per year for the past 25 years, so I know it extremely well. Whether by boat, kayak, bus, foot, or any other conceivable means, I have traversed all parts of the island, and highly recommend it to folks who have not yet experienced this little gem. As for the bias, I am not a fan of the island’s interior. Honestly there’s not much to see there and, in my opinion, the real magic of Catalina is along the water.While most of my trips have been water-based (kayaking, fishing, etc), I enjoy hiking and have been intrigued with the idea of the Trans-Catalina Trail since it officially opened. This past week, I figured I'd give it a go, or at least a part of it. My quick 24-hour blitz was focused on the island’s west end and I purposefully avoided the section from Avalon to Little Harbor as I don’t consider it a good return on my physical/time investment. It’s a big up and downhill slog with very little to see. I am also not a fan of the Hermit’s Gulch or Blackjack campgrounds as they do not do justice to the camping splendor that can be had on the island.I ended up doing the 15 mile hike from Two Harbors (2H) to Parson's Landing (Parson’s) yesterday and it was mixed blessings. I am well aware that the TCT is, for the most part, nothing more than a bunch of interconnected fire roads that traverse the island with no switch-backs or contours that go straight up and down. I started in 2H and did the TCT via the Silver Peak Trail which is a straight-up climb to the 1750’ summit. This was pretty tough, but the views along the way are spectacular and I enjoyed the solitude, seeing no one on the trail.When I reached the summit, after photos and some rest, I was excited to hit the 2 mile section to Parson’s. I’d read that it was treacherous and slippery, and the reviews were correct. This must be why this section of the TCT is rated as Class III, as it required me to side-step down a good mile wondering if such a steep incline could even be safe for a fire vehicle. Seriously, this is a downhill technical scramble. I made it to Parson’s and had the whole beach to myself. As a Southern Californian, this was pure ecstasy! Parson’s is one of the best campsites on the island and I always enjoy being there. I woke and broke camp at 530am and made the 8 miles on the West End road to 2H in about 2 hours. With the blazing sun having yet to break fully and cool air, the hike and photos were amazing. Ironically, the West End road is not formally a part of the TCT, which I find odd as I consider it one of the best hikes on the entire island with consistently spectacular views of the coastline along the way.Overall, I'm glad I did it, but would never consider the entire trail, particularly if this was my first or only visit to Catalina. Here's why…1. I’ve already revealed my bias on the island’s interior of which the TCT is a major part. For me, I’d rather forego the time & physical demand it takes to hike it and be on or in the water or just relishing some of the scenery and tranquility at one of the beach-based campgrounds.2. Also mentioned, most of the trail is simply fire roads or, in some cases, paved roads, so it doesn’t give me a “hiking trail-like” feeling that I get being in the backcountry.3. If you're just trail running or looking for a nice section hike while on the island for a brief period, this could actually be good. Run to the airport and back or hike to Parsons from 2H via the West End road. Good times. Overall, the TCT is best section-hiked in my opinion.4. I believe the best way to see the real Catalina is from the water. A great option would be to mix it up and do the TCT sections from Little Harbor to 2H (probably the best section of the TCT) and then rent kayaks, do a 2-hour paddle to one of the many boat/kayak-in only sites and do some primitive camping and have the entire beach/cove to yourself. You could also kayak to Parson’s, camp for a couple of nights and do the Parson’s /Sliver Peak/Starlight Beach loop of the trail.If you want to do the entire TCT, here are some tips…1. GO ULTRALIGHT! I’d say if your pack weighs more than 17lbs with food and water you would be well-served to rethink this. I saw tons of folks with 40+lbs packs headed for the trail and nearly wept. If your gear is heavy, consider renting some of the lighter stuff (or getting some used on the internets) – your legs will thank you later.2. Bring trekking poles. All the other reviews stressed this and I avoided it since I switched the weight of the poles for a light fishing set-up instead. In retrospect, as I rub my thighs and calves while writing this, I realize that not bringing them was a big mistake.3. It gets very hot during the summer and there is virtually no shade, so think about doing the trail anytime between late Fall to early spring. In any event, bring a brimmed hat, sunglasses and plenty of sunscreen.4. A word about water. You're usually no more than 6 miles from potable water on any part of the trail, so don't overdo it. I don't drink a lot and 1 liter was plenty for my trek in the midday sun. If you drink a lot, bring 3 liters but no more than that.5. In my opinion, (outside of the aforementioned kayak/boat sites), the ONLY places to camp are Little Harbor and Parsons. If you do either or both of these, you’ll get the best of all Catalina has to offer. If you’re hardcore and doing the entire trail, blaze from Avalon to Little Harbor and do a zero-day there (avoiding Blackjack). If you miss camping at LH, you’ve missed one of the best experiences in Southern California.6. Get the TCT map from the Catalina Conservancy. It’s detailed, has mile markers and elevations. Definitely worth the $2. You can pick these up in Avalon or 2H.7. If you’re a mile-pounder and need a legacy of brutality entry in your journal, then, by all means, do the TCT! I can’t think of a tougher hike in the area that offers better views and solitude.8. Be sure to stop by the Airport in the Sky and the Harbor Reef restaurant in 2H for some tasty buffalo burgers and Catalina’s specialty drink, “Buffalo Milk.”Enjoy and if you’re trip planning, feel free to hit me up with any questions, ideas or advice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffreyp919
50,Hike and Bike,"My wife and I Biked to the ""Parsons Landing"" ( About 14 miles R/T ) , and the ride was 100% pleasurable . If we can do it... anybody can . The ocean views all the way was beautiful .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NavyMarine1
50,Wrigley Memorial to Renton Mine Hike,"First obtain a permit for the ""Wrigley Memorial to Renton Mine Hike"" from the Catalina Conservancy in person at 125 Clarissa Av Avalon, CA.I walked up Wrigley road to the East End Light Road where the Trans Catalina Trail begins. The East End Light Road is a dirt road, and is used by one of the tour companies for off-road tours. After about 2 miles the road splits, stay right. at mile marker 6 look for the dirt road leading down to the back of the Botanical Gardens. The total hike is a 9 mile loop from down town Avalon. It took me 3.5 hours to complete. It is fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/capttml
50,hike of all hikes,"My sister and i did 12mi, from Haypress to Little Harbor camping at Blackjack and then Little Harbor. Beautiful. On the beach. This was the most difficult hike i've ever done. All ups and downs. No switchbacks. No shade and we did it in early November. The island is very dry now. very scrubby and parched. Do not attempt this hike in summer. We didnt see buffalo until we got to Two Harbors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renee2012
50,Great Hike,Hiked to the top of the ridge from a beach and back down. Great views (if you're not in the clouds) and a good chance of seeing deer or buffalo.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pgrandst
50,Day 2 proved that I was out of shape!,"We hiked the trail from Avalon to Two Harbors, spending the first night at Blackjack campground. The last ascent into the camp was a killer! We saw deer, fox, and bison while on the trail. The mile markers and trail signs are fairly new and easy enough to follow. I needed all 3 litters of water each day, refilling at the campsites. Wonderful views, and only saw other hikers at the campgrounds - almost like we had the island to ourselves!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lee-Tarbet
50,Great Place for a Tough Trail Run,"I'm a runner, and whenever I travel I always scope out the best places to run. Our cruise ship had a stop in Catalina for the day so I was excited to check out the Trans-Catalina Trail. I was not disappointed. I was a little worried about taking a wrong turn and getting lost, but the trail was well marked. Starting and finishing at the dock, I ended up running 12 miles with about 3,000 feet of climbing. At the top you can see the ocean on both sides of the island. The trail is pretty barren and dry so bring your own water. There are some off-shoots so you can add some other trails into the mix if you want. At the end of the run I jumped into the ocean for a nice little swim along the beach. I had taken the first shuttle over from our ship, and my wife took one a couple of hours later and meet me at the dock. We then spent a wonderful day in Avalon together.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BidwellRunner

40,Hot and Challenging with a Backpack (September),"We went September 11-13th. Forecast was high 75/low 66. Came from Scottsdale, AZ so thinking 75 would be cool or at least comfortable and easily doable from 12-5pm. This was not to be the case.Day 1 - We got off the ferry and took a taxi to Hermit Gulch. Charge was $17 for 6p. We started at Hermit Gulch trailhead at 11:45. It was one grueling hike up 1.7 miles in 95 degree temperatures with 50% humidity carrying a 25# pack to pick up the Trans-Catalina. To top it off the map is poorly done and hard to follow. We got lost once on the trail, so decided to pick up the road and follow that to Blackjack Campground rather than risk taking another wrong turn in the heat. The entire hike took approximately 5.5 hours. The scenery was not the greatest on this section, the air was still and hot, so it made for long afternoon. We saw our first Bison near the intersection of trails, that was a highlight along with a car stopping and asking us if we wanted a cold gatoraid about a mile before the Blackjack turnoff. There was water at Haypress Park which we had not planned on and it was a welcomed surprise as we were going through lot of water quickly. I went through 3.5 liters between 2.5 liters of water and 2 gatoraids. I am guessing that we hiked a total of 9.5-10 miles as following the road, put us above the campground so we had to walk a bit further than if approaching by the trail. We did have one person in the group that stayed on the trail and said there were lots of ups and downs.At Blackjack we had assisted camping with Catalina Backcountry. Deanna is the owner and did an excellent job bringing us tents, sleeping bags, pads, pillows and a delicious gourmet dinner complete with wine and dessert. The next morning she even brought us coffee at 6am, but this really is not necessary as the Airport in the Sky Restaurant is just a 2 mile trek away. We had a few Bison trek through the camp while we were there and I should also mention there is water at the camp and a cold shower but difficult to operate and open to the surroundings so no privacy.Day 2 - Blackjack to Two Harbors. The first leg is to Airport in the Sky. Good place to stop to fuel up. Also can save on weight and get breakfast or lunch here if backpacking. This was 2 miles and took a little less than 1 hour with packs. From there it's another 5 to Little Harbor, which took another 2 hours. Pretty beach and camping available here. 2 of us pressed on and took the ridgeline trail to Two Harbors, which is about 4.5 miles and took another 2.5 hours. I sent my pack with the other 4 as they elected to take a shuttle from Little Harbor to Two Harbors. I had read another review that said this was one of the most scenic sections, so wanted to see it. The trail followed the ridge with the ocean to the left. There was on and off breeze and marine layer (clouds). There were lots of big hills - very glad that I did not have my full pack and had just taken a fanny pack. There is a resting spot near the top at approx. 12,500'. We actually ran into another backpacker there. On the whole trail, we only saw 3 other hikers the entire time. We stayed in a house that is rented by Banning House and it was so nice to have a shower, sleep in a bed, and have a cold beer at the local café.Day 3 - Another big day of hills, Two Harbor's to Parson's Landing. Starting at sea level and topping out at approximately 1800' and then back down to sea level. Since we were getting picked up by Deanna at the end, I elected to leave my pack at the Banning House and just carry a fanny pack with water, snacks, sunscreen - this was a great plan as the hills would have been very tough with the pack. Saw several more Bison along the way. Actually ended up walking through Emerald Bay Camp and there was water there to fill up. We made it to Parson's in 3 hours and 15 min. This is a beautiful beach and the water was refreshing. Wish I could have stayed here longer and camped, but this was the end of the trek for us. Guessing about 30 miles total with getting lost once and overshooting Blackjack campground.I am glad I did it, enjoyed the experience. Wish we had spent more time along the coast, as the interior was a little bleak due to the drought. Any grass or wildflower was burned to a crisp, but lots of green cacti (prickly peak) on the hillsides. Deanna said it is beautiful in the spring.There are lots of ways to do this trail, but working with an outfitter was perfect for us. It would have been nice to do it unassisted but at 53, it was nice to not have to carry a tent and food for 3 days, plus it was also great to have an option of switching out to a fannypack when I was tired and did not want to struggle on the big hills under the weight of a pack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindym576
40,Get away from it all,"Avalon can get crowded, noisy and annoying. In just a short drive, you can get on the Trans Catalina trail and go for a nice, quiet hike in the middle of nowhere. We hiked for a couple of hours and only ran into a few people. It is green, beautiful and ocean views along the way. Such a nice break from the hustle & bustle of touristy Avalon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatriceD97341
50,"Amazing Hike, Fantastic Scenery, Good for Experienced Hikers","We did this hike last year in July. Our Trans-Catalina adventure was a 2 night backpacking trip which started from Avalon. We got in the earliest boat to leave for Catalina on Friday, docked around 7:30ish at Avalon and started the trail immediately from Avalon. From Avalon to Blackjack Campground it's no so difficult. I mean it's strenuous...but it's not that bad. Hiking this time of year it's important to watch out for poison oak that loomed around the trail where Hermitt Gulch Camoground is and at times, they are very hard to notice so yes be mindful and KEEP IN MIND the saying: ""Leaves of three, leave it be"". Or at least that's how the saying went. Reached Blackjack Campground around 5pm. So as you can see between 7:30-5pm is a pretty long 14 mile hike. Besides me and my husband there was only another group of 5 backpackers on the trail and that was it.Blackjack Campground-Airport in the Sky: This hike consisted of a very easy 2 mile hike. Got up at 8am, had breakfast and left the campsite around 10:30. Got to Airport in the Sky around noon and obviously we had to try the Bison Burger. Hung out here for about an hour, rested our feet, had some awesome chocolate chip peanut butter cookie (also bought another one for the road as a motivator) and we were on our way).Airport in the Sky-Little Harbor Campground: This consisted of a 5.5 mile hike, and this is where the fun begins. From Airport in the sky you're on a trail for approx 1 or 1.5 miles then you hit a dirt road but don't let this fool you. This road is a downhill climb. It's definitely necessary to have trekking poles or your knees will hurt like crazy. Every now and then you get an uphill break and it goes back downhill. From then on to LIttle Harbor Campground, your hike is pretty flat.Little Harbor Campground-2 Harbors. So here you have a choice: 1) take the 7 mile dirt road to 2 Harbors which is easier but it'll take you longer OR 2) take the Ridge Line Trail which is 4.5 miles to 2 Harbors BUT it's a lot more difficult. Seriously...if you start early enough and have plenty of time, TAKE THE RIDGE LINE TRAIL. You will never forget the view. The ocean will always be to your left and although the hills are steep and I mean pretty steep, the huffing and puffing is worth the spectacular scenery. Reached 2 Harbors by 7pm and there was enough daylight to pitch tent and eat dinner.All in all we did 26 miles of the Trans-Catalina's 37 miles and we plan on coming back to finish it off. If it had not been for the obvious work schedule, it would have been epic to do the whole trail. ***NOTE*** Although they say that the Trans-Catalina is 37 miles you still have to backtrack to get back to 2 Harbors and take a boat ride back to the mainland which makes this grand total of a little over 53 miles. Unless you're rich and happen to have your own boat waiting for you on the other side of the island. :o)Tips:1) Carry light, I cannot stress this enough. I think my 24 lbs pack was too heavy so now I know to be an ultralight hiker.2) Cut out what's not necessary. Moleskin, tylenol, bandages ARE necessary.3) Don't count miles. You start counting and you start getting discouragedHmmm that's it for now. Since I'm writing this a few hours after getting back from the Catalina means I was pretty stoked about this backpacking trip so photos to come shortly!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreenAnthroSlug
50,Spectacular views and hike,"My husband and I planned to go on a hike from the Catalina Airport to Avalon on the Trans Catalina Trail.. We took a bus to the airport the day before to scope out the environment. The road to the airport is not much of a travelled road by tourists because driving is limited with permits. It is primarily used by locals and tour buses. We had acquired the necessary hiking permits online and made a 7:30 am reservation to get to the airport by taxi and start the hike. We decided to ask our driver to drop us off just short of airport where we could reach the trail. We then hiked toward Avalon and took the Divide Trail that circles the ridge line of mountains around Avalon. We had a small map and the trail signs were adequate. The weather was perfect except for fog creeping up from the opposite side of Avalon that blocked seeing the ocean on the other side of the island but kept us cool on the hike. We hiked to the East End down to Pebbly Beach. The walk was easy and it went moderately up and down in elevation. The last hour was primarily downhill. We hiked about 11 miles, five hours and not once did we see another human being. We startled a Catalina fox on its hunt for dove and buffalo moved about in one area. We saw lots of wildlife tracks. This was a peaceful hike and the views of Avalon Bay were spectacular. Take water and snacks as there are no facilties. I had cell reception and would recommend taking a cell phone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Laurie48
