20,Not a fan,"Came here once with my husband. We were surprised that the place was packed and no available seats. We ordered a couple beers anyway. To our surprise, the both beers were nasty. My husband wasn't even able to finish his beer due to it tasting almost like molasses. If you want food, you had the choice of ordering from a menu and have the food delivered. Since then, however, I've learned that gourmet lunch trucks alternate at this place, including the Holy Moly Truck. So that definitely is a plus and likely something that will attract more customers.",LorazeTam

40,Great Hidden Place in San Fernando,"Found this place in passing on line one day and so glad I did. It's a little off the beaten path but worth the find. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. If your new to craft beers just give them an ideal of what you like and let them put a flight together for you. Very fun place for couples or groups. They have a cabinet full of board gams, darts, and free pretzels and popcorn. They don't serve food but there is a food truck out side and you can order in. Can't wait to go back with more people. Love this place.",Kevin12700
40,"Chill Vibe, come thirsty!","If you like beer, you'll like this place. They have several varieties that they brew on site. The prices are pretty reasonable too with a flight (tasting sampler) costing about $10. I'm not really a beer drinker but I liked the cucumber pale as it was light and fruity. The place itself is hard to find so just plug the address in your phone and it will take you to the warehouse. Once inside, there are plenty of tables and a few games such as darts and the bean bag toss. The vibe is chill and dress extremely casual. One thing to note is that they don't serve food. So be sure to bring your own or eat before you come. They do provide pretzels and popcorn to go with the beer. Nice place for a group of friends to catch up.",Caroline L
50,Wait... Where is this place?!,"Hidden in an industrial zone and so new that Waze doesn't know how to get there and the Google street view doesn't show any signage for the place. Is a little slice of the American Dream called the San Fernando Brewing Company.The building is white and totally nondescript save for the big sign and a small, unmarked door off to the right.Enter and you will find a full fledged brewery with a decent sized tap room. In short, the beer was good. They don't serve food but there was a food truck outside. The key here is the people. Everyone I talked to, from the serving staff to the Brewmaster was friendly, helpful and had the wonderful pleasant smile of people who were actually enjoying what they were doing.I really enjoyed ""the Matador"" which was their red on the bottom and their stout on top. Ask about other special drinks like that.It's very simple. Go before the word gets out. This place is going to do well. If you can, go on a weekday just to make the experience as handcrafted as possible.",EddyDC
