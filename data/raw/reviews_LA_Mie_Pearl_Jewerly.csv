50,Pick and oyster and find a pearl,"What is not fun about picking out an oyster and seeing what kind of pearl is inside? Will it be pink, white, cream, black? How big will it be? They can also set the pearl into a ring or pendant for you in either silver or gold; depending how much you want to spend. If you really love picking out oysters, you can pick till you have a complete set...earrings, ring and pendant. Also, they will size and appraise the pearls for you. In the event you don't want your pearl in a setting; then they will put in a zip lock bag for you and attach the bag to a card from their store which shows their appraisal of the pearl. The owners are very nice and it really was a fun experience. I appreciated that there was no sales pressure to put the pearl in a setting, if I didn't want to. Also, they have a booth at the LA County Fair every year.",SBayKat
50,Great experience for all ages,"This is a family tradition for us. We love the magic of picking a shell and the anticipation of what you're going to get. We've had beautiful black pearls and large while pearls in our shells. My 7 year old love this place. Check out their jewelry shop too, nice stuff and you can haggle the price a bit. Must do if you're on the Pier.",X L
50,Perfect thing to do on a date - pick your own pearls,"After dinner at a restaurant on the Redondo Pier, we found a pearl jewelry store called Mie Pearl that let you pick your own oyster for about $12.00 Each oyster is guaranteed to have at least one pearl since it's cultured, but my wife picked was lucky and picked a twin! 2 cream colored 6mm pearls! We had them set as an earring set.She's happy, I'm happy. We thought it was a great unique attraction perfect to couples or families strolling the beach or pier at Redondo (we saw a family trying to out do each other with the pearl picking...)",ExtremeFishing
