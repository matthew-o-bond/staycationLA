50,Perfect location,Beach was perfect. Surfers in abundance and our family enjoyed watching them. Parking was in a lot with stairs leading down to the beach. We would love to visit again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adventure627194
30,Representative of the many beaches in Southern California,"Topanga Beach is easy to get to from Topanga Canyon in Laos Angeles. You do have to cross an small mountain range to get to the Pacific Coast Highway. It's not very far south of the beach at Malibu. Topang Beach does not have the famous restaurants, Like Malibu, but the views of the ocean and mountains are similar. It's a pleasant place to spend a day or part of a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeFlynnLaPlataMD
50,So quiet!,"This beach is not as big as others in the area, but I think it's a valid alternative if you're looking for a quieter place. There are people, of course, but it is not crowded and everybody seems to be respectful of the local quiet and there's no yelling or such.It was fun just to sit there and watch the -few- surfers riding waves (well, it was December after all), or just admiring the local fauna.The beach is also easily accessible for people with disabilities!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LelaLovesTraveling
40,Topanga beach,This place is between santa monica and Pacific palisades on your way to Malibu. Great place to hang out beach is small and intimate park your car on the pch and walk to the beach. Close enough to see from the pch. By the way the ocean water in the west coast is always cold. Around 50 to 60 degrees even in the summer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexgQ2787RW
40,This is NOT a dog beach,"Great little beach with nice sand, lifeguards, small surf and both paid lot-parking & street parking at the foot of Topanga Cyn Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdef2015
50,Great little spot free of crowds,"We stopped at this beach for a quick day trip. We were here about 2hrs or so. It was a quick drive over from Calabasas where we were staying. The beach was easy to access from the PCH parking right on the street and a parking lot. You go doen a flight of stairs to the brach and you forget you are right on the freeway. There was a handful of people on the beach with us which made it nice and relaxing for a Friday. The beach is for surfers. There were a dozen or so out xatching waves. All in all the beach was very easy to get go, clean and not over crowded. Worth the stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmarx121
40,Another deserted beach,toping state beach is just down the road from Malibu beach. As we visited very early in the morning it was still deserted. Very easy to park there too.A lovely white sandy beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bl0ndie72
50,Alternative to the craziness of Venice,Alternative to the craziness of Venice. Perhaps an “AltVen”? Downside it is in the midst of the raceway called the Pacific Coast Highway or PCH. Great beach. But if you have time venture further up PCH to Zuma or Leo Carrillo.Topanga State Beach is easily accessible by public transportation. Fairly close to Santa Monica. The Getty Villa museum is nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
40,Malibu Beach,"Topanga State Beach is easily accessible from Hwy 1 and even on the Sunday we visited you can get parking at the side of Hwy 1. It’s a beautiful beach, it is rocky so wear beach shoes. Well worth a visit and less crowded than other beaches in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/motorcar1
50,Amazing stretch of beach!,"Highly accessible, few people, great views! Yes, the 1 highway is busy with a stream of traffic, but just walk down the path and the highway noise just goes away!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41Wahine
50,Great alternative,"Great alternative to most of the busy state run beaches in the area. This is just down the PCH from Will Rogers State Beach and is smaller and more intimate.The beach is VERY clean, but is far rockier than most public beaches, and is a bit smaller. There are less places for you to sit comfortably rocks are on most of the beach, but it seems less full even during peak time of day.There are a good number of surfers, but they tend to stay in a specific part of the beach where ingress/egress is harder to the water. The water gets deep FAST. Less than 15ft out, it was easily close to 6ft deep. If you're looking for some fun wave running, this isn't the place and you want to bring water shoes for the rocks.All in all, a great beach and it is kid friendly, just keep them even closer than normal.Parking is cheap or free if you walk far enough away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Warnerdang
40,Very easy to get to,"Some beaches along PCH are very dangerous to get to and some are just a breeze. This is one of the easier beaches to get to. Very nice beach on the PCH and this should be an easy spot to get to. We only stayed about 30 minutes to half an hour but if we weren’t trying to do so many beaches along the PCH, it can very easily be enjoyed for the better part of a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
40,Stopped by for dirt-bag shower after a bike ride in the Santa Monicas,"I crawled in here after a suffer-fest bike ride in the heat of the Santa Monicas. There was easy parking on the PCH, but there is also parking lot parking available.On a Monday afternoon the beach was pretty empty, may 15-20 people. There were some open air showers for free facing the water. So this was a nice spot to cool down and clean off before sitting in LA traffic on the way back to SD.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unpossible
50,Awesome spot,Great waves and not crowded. Parking lot right above the beach. Good spot for young kids to explore. Lot of surfers so be careful if you like to body surf. Some very talented surfers of all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rob24242013
40,"Surfers paradise, swimmers stay away","This beach is the ideal surfers spot, it offers parking and a surfers only beach, yes you are not aloud in the water without a surf board. The life guards will immediately whistle you out. The beach is kinda rocky and the swell is really big. You hate on a mini peninsula so you get the waves from two angles. I would pack a lunch and bring plenty of water as there are no snack stands or food places near by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexanderfedericoIV
40,nice location,"this area was nice. parking close to beach. nice swim area. it was a little windy and the ocean waves were high, but still a nice swim.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213jacquelyny
40,Swimming nook...,"Topanga is one of my favorites; it sits right between Santa Monica and Malibu (proper) and is very easy to access without overcrowding. A swimming nook and also an area to surf all on the same terrain. If you are feeling that mid-day hunger, use the pedestrian underpass and get your fix at the Reel Inn (fresh seafood and it's great to people watch).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7
50,"Nice beach with ample, easy parking","Parking is right by the road and with a 15 second walk you are on the beach. We liked the beach a lot and enjoyed the variances it offered with parts of it having smooth rocks and another part that was mainly sandy. It was high tide when we were there so watching the surfers was nice. Saw whales in the area too so keep your eyes open. Our favorite part was discovering a woman from an area aquarium picking up sea hares and moving them further out or placing them behind rocks so as not to be washed too close to shore again that they can't get back out. The sea hares look like giant black slugs approx the size of a papaya or a little bigger. Our girls joined in and rescued quite a few themselves, which they loved immensely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kloverfield
50,A favorite,"Another one of my favorite surf spots, the beach is beautiful so bring the family, there are rest rooms. Parking is slightly troubling unless you want to pay the full price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vindensskygge
40,I mean... it's a beach,"It's a beach. There's sun and sand and usually plenty of parking. You can swim, use the restroom, bring a picnic, and relax.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/992elizabetht
40,Quiet in the morning,"I stopped by here to watch some early, 6:00 AM, surfers last week before heading to the airport. It was very quiet, parking was easy. I parked along the PCH instead of in the provided parking lot.I would like to come back during the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigcN9891HF
30,Another good point break...,"Topanga has a fun wave with the right swell it is way good. Breaks on different swells than malibu or sunset. Several different breaks/peaks: cove, inside section, top, and boomers.Crowded. Crowded with angry guys from the valley.Crowded with never great surfers that don't remember to have fun.Show respect & courtesy.Smile and wait your turn.Don't drop-in, ignore the mad-dog vibes and you'll have fun...Or you can go a little south to sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,"Beautiful Hot Day, Clear Skies - Nice Park: Topanga State Beach",We were driving down Pacific Coast Highway (Highway 1) stopping here and there. We had a hot beach day with clear skies in October. Topanga State Beach is very scenic.There are nice views of the Santa Monica Mountains as well.Its a good place to go hiking as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Peaceful And Free Entertainment,"If you are driving highway 1 and want free entertainment, stop at Topanga State Beach and watch the surfers! The Santa Monica Pier and Mountains are in the surrounding areas which makes for a great view! Wonderful experience and not crowded. We sat on the rocks and enjoyed the entertainment while watching the sun set over the mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ansilva12
30,Nice beach,Anything in Malibu is going to be nice and this beach does not disappoint. Be sure to set aside time to visit,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teresamd0906
40,Close to LA Beach...,"A fun spot near LA, only a few miles inside Malibu. Parking in lot or on PCH / Hwy 1 for the daring ( or foolish. ) Rocks near the PCH, so move around carefully. Fun beach w views...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,Okay,This beach can be very crowded...parking is along the road. Other beaches are nicer as far as beaches. Surfers are out in the water more often than not.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/448cheriep
30,nice not crowded,We just stopped by during our tour of the coast to watch the surfers but there were families enjoying the sun and it's probably a nice place to spend a few hours at the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vasile123
50,great day out,amazing place to visit wild life everywhere and watch out for those huge spiders a day to remember..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RacewayCornwall
50,less crowded and neat beach,This beach is very less crowded and you can always take your kids to play for the day long. Parking on the side of the road is easy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896gayathrin
40,Nice place to visit,"Depending on the time of year, this place can be quiet or really crowded. The scenery is terrific. Sand is ok but there are a lot of rocks. So be careful. If the surf is up its a good place to watch surfers although Zuma is better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/am08540
50,A jewel,"As a local who loves this beach I wish i could tell you all to stay away. This little beach is beloved by local surfers and on the other side of PCH is one of our favorite places to eat, The Reel Inn. Yes its rocky but those rocks hold tons of sea creatures to observe tide pool style. We have seen seal snails, spiney lobsters, sea cucumbers and evey a baby octopus here in the rocks. At low tide you can walk past the sea wall and see all the expensive houses on the coast. Just be cool to the locals. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackS181
20,SURF'S UP HEADS UP,"Like Surfrider Beach, it's closer than Zuma but look out for surfers who are running across the road no matter what and drivers who are slamming on their brakes in a useless attempt to find parking. A few days ago we saw two barefoot surfers making a mad dash across the hot asphalt to their cars while carrying open glass bottles of beer it's gnarly dude! Above all be safe on PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmalibu
40,Nice vistas,"It was foggy but what a beautiful area. Nice vista, surf and good vibes. Great mountains to drive in close by. A So Cal staple and a must visit when in L.A. area",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneg855
50,Inexpensive and Beautiful,"Abundant, affordable parking with decent bathrooms. This is a great place to watch sufers, enjoy the breeze. Far away from the city but close enough to be accessible. Away from the crowds of the Santa Monica Pier and the cost of Malibu. After a nice day at the beach, you can take a long scenic drive through Topanga Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geoutah
40,"Great sunsets, surfing and swimming","we stopped by to see the sunset as it is one of the few beaches where the sun sets over the ocean this time of year. the wind surfers were out in force and the sun set was awesome. A small beach, but free parking on the roadside. A little less crowded than other beaches as we found parking easily. Go for the sunsets as it is a great view reflecting off the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
40,A quiet beach,"We visited late on a sunny Saturday and the beach had surfers and families, but still was peaceful. The shores are a bit rocky, so beware when wading. The beach offers great views of the Los Angeles area. We saw pelicans diving for their food which was rather entertaining. Parking was free on the side of the road, but there is also parking on site for a small fee. Topango State Beach is a short and lovely drive from Los Angeles, and was devoid of the freak shows found on some of the other beaches.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0ther_of_5
20,Locals suck,If you're tempted by peeling point break waves beware of the local stink eye and negative energy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuLife
