50,So near yet far away!,"So near yet far away! Easy to access on the Angeles Crest Highway or simply drive to Eaton Canyon in Pasadena. Or hike to the Bridge to Nowhere above Azusa. Drive to the Mount Wilson Observatory or even hike there from Pasadena.So much to explore and so close to the city. Hike, camp, picnic or simply take a scenic drive from La Canada to Palmdale.Spectacular and often overlooked experience.Too many view the San Gabriel Mountains as a backdrop for Los Angeles and the Rose Bowl!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
50,Just around the corner,On a beautiful Saturday morning we took off for a day trip up in the mountains to the southwest of Antelope Valley. Barely an hour from Quartz Hill we found ourselves high enough up to feel the cold. After a week of rain and cold in the valley we also found lots of snow higher up in these mountains. And although they were not accessible to daytrippers like us the peaks were all full of the white stiff. And the hillsides were taking on a green fuzz from rhe rainfall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfindysz
40,A great change,"Of course not the largest mountains, but still impressive, They are a great visual when driving along the concrete freeways, They offer many recreational spots, even just to pull over if your are driving thru. Can be some stunning views. Pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Randy2353
10,Ridiculous,"To call the San Gabriel Mountains a Santa Paula attraction is ridiculous. They are located many miles from here, and aren't visible from here. This is ridiculous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Family Hiking in Los Angeles,Mother’s day… We planned a family hiking trip @ Sturtevant Falls in the San Gabriel Mountains. All seven of us went trekking. It is one of the finest waterfalls in Angeles National Forest. The 3.25-mile hike from Chantry Flats Road to Sturtevant Falls follows a pristine creek past resort era cabins. It happened to be the most popular hikes in the San Gabriel Mountains near LA. People of all age groups seem to enjoy in their own way... Some perspiring... Some taking a dip... Some romancing... All in the family!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cshastry2
50,So Many Amazing Trails,"The San Gabriels, often overlooked in favor of the Santa Monica Mountains, are absolutely stunning. There are SO MANY trails - from waterfall trails to Mt. Wilson and the observatory - that offer some of the best views in Los Angeles. In these mountains, you feel like you're out in nature (the Angeles National Forest). Climbing to the top you can get city views but there are so many hidden trails that just make you feel lost in the woods.Here are a few (of the gazillion) good ones: Eaton Canyon, Sturtevant Falls, Mt. Wilson",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
50,Fall colors along SR-2 Angeles Crest Hwy,"Yes, you can see fall colors in Los Angeles County. Take the drive through these mountains on SR 2 for a spectacular visual treat. We actually started on the east side and drove westward in the afternoon and that was backwards. The lighting and photographic opportunities were better looking behind us for most of the drive. (Best to go west in the morning, east in the afternoon.) Dress warmly and bring gloves for your hands. It gets much colder in the mountains and the wind will make it even colder than the thermometer. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kauai-Biz-Traveler
40,Majestic and massive,"The first 2 days we were in LA it was clear and cooler and these mountains loomed over the city and could be easily seen if coming out of LAX or in Long Beach. As things heated up there were a little more difficult to see from a distance. Still, once we got into LA, they again were massive and omnipresent. One of the best places to view them was from Griffith Park where they provided a very cool backdrop. You never think about LA as a mountain city but it has just as impressive mountains as Denver or St. Lake. I would have love to hiked them as well but I certainly enjoyed the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
40,Breathtakingly Beautiful,"We went on Memorial Day and every where was busy, we managed to find a quiet spot over the east fork bridge. The unfortunate part is the graffiti, makes no sense to spoil the nature. We took a picnic up cattle creek and did a spot of gold panning, let's just say our flight home won't be upgraded or supply any crisps for the journey home from the gold ,ziltch, but we really enjoyed a few hours in the tranquility, which we had to walk away from the crowds to find but only about 15 min. A lovely place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X5675AMangelab
50,Nostalgia,"Since I lived just below the San Gabriel Mountains for nine years, it is always wonderful to go back to visit. I especially loved to drive up the mountains on a clear day in winter when the snow covers the peaks. This last time was summer so it's not as green and you have to worry about fires.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IleneB867
50,Gorgeous!,Hiking in these mountains is fun!Small creek we walked along and our dogs could swim and stay cool!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamiM506
40,"Hiking Mt. Lukens, Stone Canyon Trail","Mt. Lukens, at just over 5000 ft, is the highest point within the LA city limit. I have heard that the Stone Canyon trail to Mt. Lukens is one of the tougher hikes in the area and decided to take on it. I am quite an avid hiker myself and have done many long day hikes (>10 miles, including the Kalalau Trail in Kauai) often, but this one, is indeed one of the hardest I have experienced. The total distance from the remote parking lot off the Big Tujunga Canyon Rd to the summit is just shy of 10 miles R/T, and the elevation gain is about 3300 feet in 4 miles. On top of the relatively rapid elevation gain, the condition of the trail adds much additional difficulty. Though the trail itself seems maintained (I think), it is rather rocky/gravely throughout, so finding your footing sometimes slows down your pace. Furthermore, the trail itself is overwhelmingly unshaded - although I started the hike on a chilly early Feburary morning, I got really hot from Mile 2 because of the sun exposure. So you have been warned. However, all the above should not scare you off, if you want some fun physical challenge and/or some quality time with the wild untamed nature. And of course, you are rewarded with an expansive view of the San Fernando Valley and vast LA metro area at the summit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TurandotBeau
40,less than an hour drive from most of LA,"It's hard to believe you are so close to this much population. There are lots of hiking trails and streams easily accessible for day hikes and overnight camping (You need a permit). My favorites are: Old Baldy, 5th stream crossing, and Ice House Canyon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikek794
40,View Them & Experience Them ...,"You'll see the San Gabriel Mountains from many venues in the LA basin from Pasadena & east, to when you top out on I-10 above Muholland. They run almost west to east and form the protective barriers for the valley. Lots of trails to hike, sights to see and specials to do. Driving the Angelus Crest Hwy. gives you a nice introduction, then go back for more. Remember to take extra water when hiking, plus hike w a buddy! Enjoy Nature. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Beautiful!,Absolutely beautiful drive up the top at Crystal Lake. Very quiet and serene. Wish that I could have stayed longer. I am from the Green Mountains and the perspective is so much different then it is where I am from. It makes you appreciate the differences this country has to offer.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KjCross
50,Amazing hidden treasures,"The San Gabriel mountains, despite being so close to the city, offer an incredible escape to the outdoors, with beautiful 40' waterfalls, rivers, lakes, trails, campsites. For my outdoor friendly visitors from out of town, I always take them to the Trail Canyon Falls waterfall. One of my favorite hikes in the San Gabriel mountains.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trekkerFrank
50,Excellent!,"If you need to just get away from it all, get some fresh air, and willing to do a little bit of walking, the San Gabriel's are one of your better bets.It's a fairly easy walk and so enjoy yourselves. Be careful of and obey traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P_Munro28
50,45 mins to a world away,"The San Gabriel Mountains are about 45 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, but in terms of a respite from the city, a world away. I have been hiking, swimming, and learning here my whole life, and I have never grown old of it or run out of new trails, rivers, lakes, or campsites to love. Whether a tourist or life long Angeleno, the San Gabriel National Monument will provide you a wonderful memory and change the way you consider Los Angeles. Get out there! Go Wild!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAFRLV

50,"San Gabriel Mountains - Beautiful View; Hikes, Lakes, Fun","When you are in San Gabriel Valley area (Pasadena area), those beautiful mountains you see each day are the amazing San Gabriel Mountains. On a day after it rains, they just sparkle. They are the back drop you see to the Rose Parade on New Years Day each year.But the fun thing about the San Gabriel Mountains is the mountain areas itself. There are lakes such as Crystal Lakes. There is the scenic drive (Angeles Crest Scenic Byway) that goes through the San Gabriel Mountains (well worth a drive if in the area). There is the Mount Wilson Observatory. There is the 10,000 ft plus Mount Baldy - on a clear winter day after it snows there, its amazing.There are hikes, lake play, fishing, bike riding and more in the San Gabriel Mountains.There are fall trails to Sturtevant Falls in the Chantry Flat area.There is so much to enjoy here - go explore and you will find more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mini
50,Lovely Mountains,"These were originally the Sierra Madres & there is supposed to be some lost gold out there.This mountain range runs from east to west & with the Verdugos Mountains are the only range in the US to do so.They are also the fastest growing range in the US as well.They cut off south moving cold & are high enough to stop rain on their north side.There is a diverse geology & gem stones can be found if you know where to look.My favorite mountains are Mt Lukens north of Montrose. Mt Wilson north of Pasadena & Old Baldy the furtherest to the east & the tallest of the range.There is too much that can be said about the area so do some research on your own, then go enjoy them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
50,Here you breath fresh air you really get in touch with nature.,"Rivers, natural springs,walking trails, and trees all over. Dont forget the water dam and driving your 4x4 trucks to the mud trails were people take 4 wheelers dirt bikes and get all dirty. I dont know what's the name of that spor, there is a fee for that. The rest is free to do water ever your nature interest tells you to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunshine323m
