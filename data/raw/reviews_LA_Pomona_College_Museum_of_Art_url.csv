40,Nice,"This nice little museum, located at the southern end of Pomona College's beautiful tree- and flower-filled campus, can be uneven, but it is almost always challenging.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/califcasl
50,Always a stimulating exhibition schedule...,"This is the largest gallery in the Claremont Colleges and has a history of showing ground breaking work by both Local, regional, national and international artist's I need all media. They also exhibit graduating student work at the end of the academic year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Artisteyes
20,not great,"Quite disappointing for the self-appointed ""the Harvard of the West"". Mediocre exhibitions, not very helpful labels, basically a repository for mediocrity. Go get ice cream at Bert and Rocky's instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pianisthaohuang
20,boring and disappointing,"I was expecting a lot out of Pomona College's Art Museum, as a flagship of the ""Harvard of the West"". Fogg Art Museum it isn't. Ive been there several times, and the place is poorly designed, the items on exhibit are often neglible. What a waste. Why?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/haohuangpianist
40,Well worth the visit,"I have nosed around in Claremont for years while I worked and lived close by. The Pomona College has a good collection of art that you might miss otherwise. Come and see for yourself. Smaller, more intimate. The college cafeteria also has murals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorobo123
30,Can be funky!,"We were visiting on opening weekend, after the college opened for the year. It was a funky exhibit. There were photos on the wall from Michigan and all the homes of famous people who lived there. That was interesting. Another exhibit was an iron of a naked man, while a video of sausages in dark liquid bounced up and down, to drumming music. Odd and eccentric.You could access it easily by taking the Metrolink to Claremont, and walking just 2-3 blocks up to the College. It's right off College Blvd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA
50,Not here in 1990,This was fun and if you are on campus and like art it's a must see! the building itself is interesting and beautifully modern and the art it was quite good.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenS184
50,Small but very nice,They have quite a few holdings and some of the shows include students. It's always fun to see what they're up to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TammySue88
40,Treasures! Limited hours.,"Incredible curated national shows (Pacific Daylight), as well as cutting edge student exhibitions. Being a small college museum the hours are limited. Check before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CardamomTuesday
