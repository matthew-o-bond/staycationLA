50,Hiking,"Love hiking in the Verdugo Foothills. So lucky to have these mountains so close and easy to access. Beautiful views, not too busy, and in a short time you feel like you got away. Lucky us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MargaM974
50,Beaudry Loop,"Very good hike early morning, best view up there. public parking (watch the sign), no bathroom, usually spend 2hrs here...highly recommeded it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/srengl2018
50,Awesome Hike!,I do this loop often. Glendale has many amazing trails. This one like so many have views and not crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonzohiker
40,Nice hike and trail run,"As a trail runner, it's nice to find different ways to connect up with the fire trails that lead across the Verdugos. This is pretty much up and up. There isn't shade from trees, necessarily, just from the mountain itself, so that's dependent on the time of day. Bring protection, especially if you plan on staying on the ridge, where you won't have much shelter. Gorgeous views, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
40,"Decent Hike, Prepare","It was too hot for us to go on the hike today. Plus, we had some small children with us. This was more serious and we knew that we could enjoy the outdoors some, but that we could not get far with three small kids. It looks lovely and Iâ€™d like to go back better prepared.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfAragon
40,Bring water and sun protection,"This is a fun loop trail with some great views of Glendale and La Crescenta. The trail is about 5 miles round trip and it can connect to other Verdugo Mtn trails if you want a longer trip. The downer is that there is very little shade on the trail and absolutely no water. It's not a difficult trail and can be done by novice hikers but the lack of shade and water can make it hard. My dog completely pooped out about 2/3 of the way which actually gave me a minute for the breather I needed too. It is not as strenuous as Wildwood Canyon but it's longer so take that into consideration (same elevation but longer).Parking is in the residential neighborhood so be mindful of people's homes as you walk up.Be on the look out for snakes. On my last trip my dog tried to say hello to a stick in the middle of the road that turned out to be a 5"" snake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller
40,Great views of the Crescenta Valley and Glendale,"After the recent rains, all kinds of blooming and blossoming! We ran out of time to make the entire loop, but I'll definitely be back to finish this hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suecd48
50,"A decent hike, bring water!","I've done this trail a few times and it'll get your heart rate pumping for sure. A great portion of the trail is in the sun and since this is a fire road it is not maintained as a park, meaning there is no water on this trail. Be prepared! The two times I brought my dog he pooped out halfway through so it may be too rigorous or hot for some. It's difficulty is about equivalent to the Amir's Garden trail at Griffith Park. I also saw a snake in the middle of the trail so be cautious about going off road and where you step.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tanya_Mueller
50,Not sure if its open at night but its a nice nieghborhood.,Atmosphere is nice but at night it can be a spot to meet up and maybe talk on a bench in the park but better in daylight. As the sunsets is best id say.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/193dustyb
