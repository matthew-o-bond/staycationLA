30,A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT A FEW MILES AWAY FROM THE BEACH,"First visit I‚Äôve known of Hopkins Wilderness Park for over 30 years. I never been promoted to visit till today after breakfast from the Original Pancake House. Ohhh what I‚Äôve been missing. I‚Äôd describe this place in a much smaller scale to Central Park in New York or Griffith Park in Los Angeles. This place offers much less than the aforementioned grand municipal parks but the tiny little secret, the hidden gem in this park is the NEVER ENDING PACIFIC OCEAN BREEZE. If you want a hidden treasure just a few miles from the beach a sanctuary in the middle of a concrete jungle surroundings this is Your place!",Adventurer0099
40,How is this place possible?,"Spent an extremely pleasant afternoon here on an October Saturday with my 10 year old son and a few Cub Scouts... Such a pleasant little wooded spot smack dab in the middle of residential and commercial space... I‚Äôve driven near here many times without noticing it! Animals a-plenty, thiugh certainly no linger ‚Äúwildlife‚Äù... These creatures of the woods (birds, squirrels, turtles - we counted at least a dozen!), and koi all seem very comfortable with humans nearby, even though both animals and humans are allowed to roam freely throughout the park. There‚Äôs a manmade stream that meanders through the property and ends at a tiny pond near the entrance, so kids don‚Äôt even need to get their shoes dirty to watch and feed the turtlrs and koi. ADispenser is placed conveniently near the park office and the pond - dispenses a handful of chow for a quarter. We arrived just as some heavy rain was clearing up and we watched as it became a sunny day. While we were there, a wedding was getting started, and some hardy folks were potching tents to stay the night.The place is an anachronism... A tiny little outpost of ‚Äúwilderness‚Äù in the midst of semi-urban sprawl, just far enough away from the Pacific coast yo avoid most notice. Run by the city, and worth a visit. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be back again soon for more outdoor play.",am0eba
40,Not What I Expected,"I was a little disappointed. I was expecting something more like a botanical garden. The park is 11 acres of mostly native plants. Although I walked most of the perimeter, the trails are not distinct. In the back corner is a small amphitheater of concrete seats - not sure how it is used. There are many picnic tables and gas barbeques and several restrooms. The information says there is overnight camping, but I'm not sure where and didn't see anyone doing so.I was hoping to see wildlife, but only saw the Koi and turtles in the pond. Some of the trees had plates with the type of trees printed on them.The park is surrounded by development and while you can't go far without seeing roofs, from high spots you can see the ocean a mile of so away and rooftops extending for many miles in the other directions. There is an open feeling and it was a pleasant visit.",Kenneth L
50,A fun place to visit!,"You can walk into this park and find a stream with two ponds-turtles, coy fish, ducks big giant oak trees. There's also an amphitheater and many barbecue tables and even gas grills-although I don' t know if they actually work.",Richard K
50,Always a great place to visit,Wilderness park is an old standard in Redondo. It has been around for quite a long time and you will feel as though you have left the city once you make it into the center of this terrific place. A nice chance to escape the city life if only for a short time. Neat walking paths and a nice pond to enjoy. Fun and great for kids of all ages!,CD1970
40,Great place for a family picknick,"I am older, and have been told that I need to walk at least an hour per day for my health. This is not the place for this kind of walking because it lacks defined walking trails. However, I gave it a four star rating in recognition of its great value for family outings, (reservations for group picnics required) and its overall rustic/wilderness appearance.",Robert D
50,Great family getaway,This is by my house. It's a great little gem hidden in the middle of a bustling beach city. You can camp.overnight for next to nothing.,BorgHouse
50,Great for picnics and barbecues.,Wonderful place for families to visit. It makes you feel like you are in a world of nature and far away from the city. There are ducks and many places that you can buy food from to feed to the ducks. There are native plants and squirrels in the park.,NanaSteer
50,Wonderful Place for the Kids,"If you are looking for an outdoor space where your children can run around and explore then look no further. My kids love to feed the birds, look for frogs and turtles and explore the surroundings. My oldest daughter is 12 now and she still LOVES coming here!",Mercedes V
20,Suffering,"In the past, this has been a favorite place for me to walk around and enjoy. It has probably been a couple of years since I last visited. The front on the street and the parking lot still look good, but upon entering the disappointments started. First, on this fine August Saturday, when the sun sets about 8 PM and families might like to BBQ their dinner in the park, the sign says the park closes and locks the gate at 4:30 PM! Turning right at the entrance, I go to the eucalyptus grove, where in the past I enjoyed watching Monarch butterflies flitting about in the spring. The ground looked dry and dusty and leafless. At least one big tree has been sawed down recently (probably more), and most of the smaller, younger trees were either suffering, dying, or dead from lack of water. No longer attractive. Moving on, I notice other suffering or dying trees, and little evidence of use. The amphitheater was still OK, but the beautiful thicket of blackberries (a rarity here in SoCal) at its rear looked half dead and the rest suffering, although there were still small red berries in abundance. One of the favorite jewels of the park was its pond at the rear, teeming with lakeside plants, turtles, birds, and other wildlife, and a babbling brook feeding it. No longer. The whole pond is gone, the plants and wildlife dead, and the area around it as dry and dusty as a bureaucrat‚Äôs heart. I know there is a drought and they have to save water, but they could save some of their young trees at least. There is a small area near the front that is still attractive enough for picnic use, and the small pond there still has water, a few turtles, fish, and ducks.",rendahl
40,Hidden cool park and picnic area for families nearby,"Who would have thought a picnic and campgrounds here in the city of Redondo Beach, CAü§î. Great for friends and family to get together. The one pond when you enter has lots of turtles, exotic fishes, and we saw only 1 duck ,1 white crane bird..... very cool for the children. You can pay to feed fishes, but it was closed for that.The ranger said the other pond dried out, most likely the city of Redondo Beach got cheap. This is sad and a shame BC they could make this a vibrant place for locals nearby, especially for children to experience the outdoors without driving to Muir woods or Yosemite. Sadly also the place can improve with staff and more kid friendly.They do have a donation box, but this place isn't a priority for the city. SadüòëüòêüòëDefinitely a nice excursion for children and picnicking.",bluecar88
40,Wilderness in the middle of the Beach Cities,"Hard to believe, but Wilderness Park is a few acres of tended wilderness in the middle of the Beach Cities. From the street it doesn't look like a whole lot, but once you go inside you are immediately away from the city and from groomed landscapes such as at nearby Alta Vista Park. There are plenty of picnick tables, outdoor grills, and ample lavatory facilities. They have special programs for children which are excellent. There used to be two great ponds with fish and turtles, but for no apparent reason the larger one has been drained (minus one in my scoring). Also plenty of free parking.",00Bruce00
40,A pleasant respite from the city,"The main attractions are two ponds, filled with koi, turtles and assorted ducks. It's a free public park and has some great views. Parking is no problem and it offers a nice walk among mature trees. Oh, and it has a picnic area with BBQs. I saw some scouts and they were all having a great time. Bring the kiddies!",Ambersea
20,Starting to get run down,"I haven't been there for about a year even though it's right down the street from where I live. That's because it seems that it's not very well maintained anymore. Used to love to take the kids and just walk through so they could see the ducks and turtles. Not any ducks last time I was there. Also, the large pond was extremley mucky. I think it's closed on Wednesdays or at least everytime I tried to take the kids then, it was closed (don't know why). They do have camping there but have never experienced it.",Renae T
50,Nice park for a peaceful visit in the busy city.,"Nice park for a peaceful visit in the busy city. The pond at the bottom has fish, turtles, ducks, and the occasional night heron.",Robin D
40,A bit of Vt. in the City,"This is a piece of Vermont in a city setting, there's a man made pool with turtles and fish in it, nice hiking trails, and even a WW11 historical surprise here. They have a nice ""museum"" inside, and have camps here also in the summer. You can also rent camp sites for the night.....",susanj329
50,A little bit of nature tucked away within city limits!,"Beautiful, natural surroundings and creeks and lakes with fish, tortoises and ducks. I've been taking my little one since she learned to walk there and loved picking up pine cones and rocks. We had Tinkerbell and Peter Pan meet her and her friends there at her Fairy party last year. Tink and Pan took the kids on a treasure hunt through the park and then down to the lake before resuming their fairy flying lessons and song and dance time. The park is picturesque and our family photographer has taken family photos of us there too. Each Fall, we even camp overnight during the Family Camp event. Don't miss this park and its wonderful amenities!",abfromsouthbay
40,What a fun place,"I love Wilderness Park because it is so unexpected. We used to take our kids to the Park when they were little and even camped overnight. I felt like we had truly left the city behind and so did our kids. Because it' enclosed, I was comfortable letting kids run around like kids should - without constant supervision. It's been a while since we've been there but it is one of those unique experience that bring a smile to my face and fond memories to mind. I would love to know who came up with the idea of putting a little 'forest get away' in the middle of Redondo. It's fabulous.",RebeccaForster
20,Sad Neglect,"Shame on the City of Redondo Beach for what they are doing to ruin this park! There is a nice little pond with duck and turtles in it, fed by a short creek that rushes down a little hill. Kids have a great time using whatever they can find (stick, pine cone, etc.) to race down the stream. Also food available to feed the ducks and turtles for a quarter. But the koi others mentioned apparently died due to some mis-handling of the pond (which is a now a very dark green opaque color). There used to be a second pond in the back end of the park, with a longer stream running down a larger hill to feed it. We were told by a park ranger that Redondo Beach Public Works decided to save a little money by closing the pond and stream, and that Redondo Beach City Council ignored repeated entreaties by park users to reverse this foolish decision. Before, the nice pond in the back gave the kids a reason to take a short little hike back there. Now your kids may just gripe about being bored if you try to take them past the little pond right in the front. As a typical family making a day visit to the park, there's really nothing of interest beyond the little pond in the front. What a waste! How much $$$ is Redondo Beach saving by closing the rear pond, at the expense of greatly diminishing the appeal of one of the few reasons to ever come to the city (we came over from Long Beach to check out this park and had lunch in the city, but won't be back...not worth the trip just for the little pond, which was also the opinion of our 6 year old). Guess it's still an OK diversion for 15-30 min if you live down the street, but otherwise nothing of interest left here. (By the way, every adult at the park the day I was there had a similar response when they heard about the foolish decision to close the rear pond).",Doug274
