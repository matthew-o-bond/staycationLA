40,Great for renting kayaks,Nice affordable place to rent kayaks from. The staff is helpful and pleasant. We have rented from here thrice and have had a good experience every time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rumblingstrips
50,Great place to learn watersports,"This is a great place to get high-quality instruction in a variety of watersports, including sailing, kayaking, and stand-up paddle boards. It is affiliated with UCLA but the public can sign up for lessons and rentals (rentals only after qualifying lessons). All necessary equipment is provided and the staff is both helpful and expert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/roadtrip14
40,Good hands-on learning for young kids and teens to learn sailing,My kids have used the Aquatic center via some of the local YMCA summer camps that transport groups of children and teens up to the center from beach cities/South Bay and teach them canoeing/kayak skills and sailing in small skifs. They learn how to tack in the channel and there is a large ramp and dock to launch the boats or to tie up the sailboats. The instructors are good with kids and it's a good outdoor adventure that builds curiousity about sealife and confidence in handling oneself on open waterways. Check it out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelmom_fun
40,"Good Place to Learn Sailing, Kayaking, Rowing, Surfing, or Windsurfing","A little known gem here in Marina del Rey is the UCLA Marina Aquatic Center. They offer classes on sailing, kayaking, windsurfing, surfing and rowing -- instruction and all the equipment, even wetsuits if you need them. Plus, they have a really good summer program for kids and teens.This weekend, at the Open House I sampled sailing -- on both a Capri (very small sail boat) and a Hobie Catamaran -- and kayaking. The instructor was very friendly about giving information about the classes, the boats and best times to rent afterwards to practice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marinagal
