40,A landmark sign,Visited on our US trip with SOTC group. It is located west of LA. Route 66 End of the trail sign is at the Santa Monica pier which marks the end of the legendary American route 66. This symbolises that the road ended only when the sea stood on its way. It is place for great picture. We walked along the pier and place was very crowded on a sunny afternoon.,cp_0010

50,Had to be done!,We only had a brief stay in LA but based in nearby Marina del Rey so had a wonderful walk from there to Venice Beach and Santa Monica and of course we had to see the pier and the Route 66 sign which was extremely popular. People were literally queuing up to wait to take a photo.,jmgLowFell
