30,Nice Spot,"If you need/want a park-like setting, check this one out; near the Malibu Country Mart so a good tranquil respite from the consumer experience. Not a main draw, as in didn't see anyone there during a weekday morning, but that's a plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Nice place to Relax on any lazy Malibu day-,A walk through the PARK- Dog friendly Malibu has lots of places where Families and pets can be together and enjoy the Great outdoors-,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBjeffreyl
40,nice to take a break and watch the ducks,"This is not an ""outing"" destination, but it is a good place to decompress in the middle of the day. Ducks, bugs and flowers - nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyp400
20,Not worth stop off,"We visited legacy park around mid day and was pretty disappointed. We ran into another couple of people who basically reiterated our thoughts 'is this it? Weren't you expecting more' which gave us a bit of a laugh.Nothing much to look at, the tide was out and the park area looked as though people had just dumped a load of waste into a lagoon. There was no wildlife in the area but the beach was a pleasant surprise.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jimandkaz63
30,"Not much here to see, but good for Malibu.","This is sometimes referred to by locals as ""weed park"", not the smoking kind but natural fauna kind. The city of Malibu acquired this land some time ago to prevent over development. Good. But it was meant to be a natural state example rather than green grass and courts style park. That said, it has its wandering path in and out of the park itself but doesn't offer much to see. Its a good use for strollers and small children to walk around, all flat, but not engaging for the family with older kids. It is across the street from Malibu's revamped library and in close proximity to two shopping centers. I'd much rather visit the tidepools at Pt. Dume for kids and family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
30,Arid park,Found this by accident it was a good stop but aired and little for us to do. But great chance to get out do the car and walk around a bit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
40,park of interest..,We visited this on our stop at Malibu... so pleased we did. We loved the mosaic animal sculptures and reading the information about the native plants. We also enjoyed reading the information boards about the history of Malibu.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5inatent
40,Native plants on display,"There has been a lot of controversy over this park. Rather than make it ""pretty"", the designers filled it with native plants and tried to show what the area looked like before man came along. The complaint is that it looks overgrown with weeds. If you want a manicured park I suggest you look elsewhere. If you want to learn something you could do worse than Legacy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wildscribbler
50,"Legacy honors our environment with native grasses, plants and shrubs","Legacy Park reflects it's name and honors our environment. It's filled with grasses, plants and shrubs that are native to our ecology and environment.This park thrives during our drought and maybe someday we'll have wet years (again). Legacy is not without it's detractors & controversy.Thankfully our Malibu community decided on a park instead of additional commercial development. Of course, there are some that believe we need more overpriced clothing shops and mediocre restaurants.Thankfully our Malibu community decided on a park, filled with native grasses, plants and shrubs. Of course there are some that believe we need more unnatural-fake and nonnative grasses, plants and shrubs.Legacy also has random mosaic sculptures depicting local animals and benches throughout the park.This is terrific park that honors our community, our environment and our ecology. PCH noise does detract from this park. However, Legacy can be peaceful and serene.Yes yes yes---see a real park with native grasses, plants and shrubs. Of course, I don't think I've ever been to a park that I didn't like and was support!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Be sure to check out the mosaic sculptures,"One of the more (and, in my view, unfairly) maligned spots in Malibu. The mosaic animals are fun to look at. Best of all, it's a great place to walk off dinner after dining at any of the nearby restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
30,nice for a quick walk with your dog,"this is the original drought proof park. legacy park was ahead of the curve when they only planted native drought resistant plants. hardly a flower filled garden, but the community is thankful to have a nice open space instead of more $800 t shirt shops.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmalibu
40,Protected area for a nice walk...,"This area in Central Malibu was purchased to prevent it from becoming a shopping mall and was instead developed into an area of local fauna and hiking paths. Good place for walking with strollers and there is easy parking along the North side, opposite the PCH. Shopping and restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
10,What a waste!,"Overgrown with weeds, where a community needed a place for families could go and relax and let their kids run and play, they spent millions on what the locals call ""weed park"". Several acres of nothing, a path that goes around, some nice statues, a bench here and there and dry, brown weeds. A complete waste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,Lovely Legacy Park,"When you consider that this location used to be where the annual Malibu Chili Festival was held, it's been turned into one of the most inviting and lushly landscaped park now...hiding the fact that it is treating the water! Brilliantly designed and executed, Legacy Park is a shining example of what can be done when all parties are on the same page and just make it happen. It's was an impressive effort and now such an impressive addition to the Malibu experience. A fabulous place to stroll alone or with someone special. Don't forget to read about its history along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilkmaidTS
50,"BEAUTIFUL, PEACEFUL PLACE!","Directly behind the Malibu Country Mart and shops is the most lovely place to wander..it is actually a storm water and urban runoff project that covers 15 acres..lovely native plants, ornamental grasses, lake and bird sanctuary, beautiful landscapes, paths to wander down, and best of all, large mosaic sculptures of the native animals in the area including coyote, snakes, frog with signage about each one..really charming. Come on a Sunday and you also get the farmer's market which is in same area, across street as well as all the shops, park and eateries in the country mart area. Great place to go any time of year, lots of free parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanLosAngeles
