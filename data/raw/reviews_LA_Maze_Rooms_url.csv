50,Fun Puzzles to solve,"We did the Jack the Ripper room and it was good. There were two of us and with a few hints, we were able to escape. It would have helped if we had a few more people but not impossible with two. There were some surprises and puzzles here that I hadn't seen elsewhere and that made it fun as well as learning a little history. I can't imagine that there's something more fun to do in Culver City!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BriardM0m
50,They're Coming!,"I was lucky enough to get to beta test They're Coming at the Culver City Maze Room location. The game was almost 100% complete and I was thrilled to get to experience it. I've now done all the rooms at this location and this is definitely my favorite. Without saying too much this is a zombie themed room that leaves you trapped in the heart of LA during a zombie outbreak. The owner is a huge horror film fanatic and you can see those cinematic influences throughout the game. It's like being in your own zombie movie! From the very start, the way the players are integrated into the story line was absolutely brilliant. That along with some great tech made for a truly immersive experience.This is not an easy game by any means. It's not a scavenger hunt and my gf and I struggled during a few parts and had to ask for clues. What I liked was that with a little nudging we were able to figure it out. The solutions weren't huge leaps of faith that would be impossible to solve without being given the answer.Overall this is a great game with some very unique aspects and a highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a challenge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeSerlinStunts
