50,"Lovely Shop, Wonderful Clerks, and Terrific Merchandise","Upon needing to exchange a gift, I visited this shop and was very pleased with their wide variety of personal and gift items. The store is wonderfully laid-out, displays are easy to see and there is such an array of choices, you'll want to stay for an hour to see it all. The clerks do everything they can to help you find what you want and are lovely and resourceful.",Kac
