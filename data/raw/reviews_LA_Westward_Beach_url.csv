40,"Great beach, OK parking","Great beach to bring the kids, especially if you go early. Late afternoon it is packed. Good sized waves for body surfing and lots of sand crabs to catch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RilesMurph
50,Awesome,"Beautiful, clean, nice sand, big beach with free street parking on beach level if you get there early... We got a spot before 9am on a Fri and Sat. Family friendly with reasonably clean and large restroom. We saw lifeguards on the beach and lifeguard boat on Sat morning. Seeing sea lions and dolphins just past waves breaking was a treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zhennailu
40,Pretty beach,Very pretty beach in Malibu that was quiet and family friendly. Great for long walks. Our only complaint was that we all ended up with a tar-like substance on our feet and shoes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boilerjenni
50,Stunning ...,"Stunning long white sands and far enough of PCH to offer some peace. Parking along the road means it's merely a few steps onto the beach. Cafe at the end of the road, we've seen it used in CSI Los Angeles . We stopped here for a couple of hours to relax on the beach. Water was a bit cold in March to go in but it was still lovely to stroll along he shoreline. Good place to also stop and take photos, if like us you're traveling along the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tina16flight
40,Big beach,Good sand no crowds plenty of parking and great for walking along the beCh. Enjoyed our stop here as you will,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
50,Beautiful beach! Free parking,Just before Zuma Beach and the expensive parking is Westward. It is worth it to park here for free and walk down to Zuma. Beautiful surrounds and clean sand!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mchelle1
50,Best view of LA shore,"I was recommended to go here by our host at AirBnb. So we went there during sunset. There is a short hike from the beach to top of the small hill, takes approx 15 minutes to get to the top. You will have from there almost 360 degree view. It is really amazing to see Santa Monica and Malibu shore when all the light go on. Very amazing sunset as well. This is a must go place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pitrf
50,Hidden gem,Favorite of locals looking for a spot of sand and a great view of the waves (and usually some marine life). Not a surfing beach at all. Safe for kids - never crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/768nancyi
40,Another almost perfect Malibu beach...,Westward Beach is just south of Zuma and actually connected.It's about a mile long. Take the ZUMA exit and follow westward road south. Lots of room and space for all.Nice wide sandy beach with plenty of restrooms and trash cans....use themPut your trash in the cans.Lifeguard towers and a smaller headquarters south near pt. dume.Parking along the sand.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Very quiet beach,This is a wonderful sandy beach with amazing views. Much more quiet than most of the other beaches in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMFANDME
50,Don't Miss This!,Do not miss this beach! It's tucked around the bend from Zuma and I found it to be much nicer and less crowded than Zuma. The views are beautiful and it's easy access to the Point Dume Hiking Trails... I would recommend checking this place out!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/629brendanp
50,First class beach in Malibu,"Very nice beach. Accessible by car, free and paid parking (fee area is much less crowded). Restrooms, outdoor showers and foot showers, restaurant halfway along beach. At end is Point Dume with waves breaking on rocks. Great sand and surf to walk and wade in, spectacular place for sunsets. Overall a wonderful and relaxing place to hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MerrillC_12
40,An extension of Zuma Beach,"Like the adjacent Zuma Beach, it has plenty of paid parking, restrooms and a big life guard station -- plus a really good restaurant right at the entrance (The Sunset). Best of all, it's a lot less crowded than Zuma Beach -- and you're right next to the Point Dume Headlands State Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
40,One of the best beaches in So. California,"Get there as early as possible. We got there at 11:30am and all of the parking was full with no nearby parking anywhere. There was no street parking, the free and paid lots were both full as well. We ended up not being able to enjoy Westward at all but had to drive further north up the coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RajiR_12
50,Top 10 Beach IMHO,"I've been all over the world, and have visited most of the famous beaches and when I come home to Malibu - I still think West are between the two main beaches, although if you have kids or are going to be in the water alot you might want to be closer to a life guard. Due to limited parking, even on a busy summer day - this section of the beach is never crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zumanbabe
50,Local Secret,"As beautiful as Zuma with a LOT less people! The sand is a little firmer, but beautifully situated. This isn't where you go if you want to play volleyball (no nets), but if you want to relax at the beach without fighting the crowds, this is your beach...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuMomma
50,Favorite place on Earth,"I was tipped off to this area by a hiking book that mentioned the beach walk from Point Dume to Paradise Cove. Westward beach (just below Point Dume) has quickly become my favorite place in the world. I've been back about 6 or 7 times already (I just moved to L.A. last year and live about 30 minutes away). So far, I have seen sea lions galore, dolphins playing in the waves, and 3 separate occasions have even watched mother and calf gray whales swim by on their northward migration. Apparently they hug the coastline to avoid attacks from killer whales. All of this can be seen from a comfortable spot on the beach. I also love the quality of the sand, and how relatively peaceful this beach is compared to other ones nearby. And of course there is the added benefit of the nearby trails and nature paths that go up and over Point Dume.The parking fees are a bit high ($8 daily off-season, & I've heard they increase during the summer), and once you're parked they won't let you leave and come back. However, if you get there early there's free street parking down the road. We usually get there as early as possible to avoid the fee, but since this is my favorite escape from crowded L.A. I'm willing to pay the fee when necessary!Bottom line, if you love stunning views (from the top of point dume as well as from the beach itself), wildlife (such as sea lions, dolphins, and gray whales), and fabulous sand to sink your feet into, this is a great beach for you! I LOVE this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/neuronsarecool
50,One of the best beaches in Malibu,"This beach was so undiscovered for many years. In the old days one could drive, walk or ride a bike down the beach road and not see another soul at all. At the very end, that you now have to pay to go to, you might recognize the rock formations of the Point of Pt. Dume..where MANY a commercial and movie has been filmed. You can still rock climb the cliffs, too...where I first learned how to...scared to death. The sunsets are beautiful here and the water is safe to swim in. Lots less crowded than Zuma or Trancas. Best to bring your own food and drinks, though. There are restrooms, but not sure how well they are maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MilkmaidTS
50,2015Â´s favorite spot for weddings,"This is a gorgeous beach, with daily rock climbers at the end of the road. The surf is extra active near the rocks as well. I've spotted whales, sea lions and pelicans here too.The beach is very clean and is regularly patrolled by the life guards and sheriffs. I'm a wedding coordinator and have had four in March alone! (Permitted) The water is always a gorgeous deep blue and teal, with always a little marine layer lingering.The bathrooms aren't always the best, but the toilets work well amd there's always toilet paper. You can find showers on the other side of the buildings. Parking isn't always the best either, but if you're patient, someone is always leaving.Videos and commercials are shot here often & there's a path to go up to the top of the rocks. People also park up there and walk down. It's a gentle climb, but looks a little slippery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/691nikkib
50,Really great place to visit,We visited this beach on recommendation from a friend and are so pleased we did.The weather was great so made our time spent on the beach even better. Lovely sand and clean beach. We had lunch at The Sunset which I will review separately so valet parked with them but there appeared to be plenty of other parking.I would recommend taking a picnic or snacks and drinks as there is not really anywhere to get anything to eat and drink apart from The Sunset.Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandys1965
50,Nice Hidden Gem,"Most people go to Zuma, but this beach is just as great. Parking limited on the road, but paid parking area available. There is a restaurant close by called The Sunset with good food. Bathrooms are available and clean. I ride my bicycle here every day or 2 and many people walk this stretch , both on the road and parking lot, as well as the beach. Great exercise area, and you can hike a short trail to the top of Point Dume for awesome views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeT394
40,Great for relaxing/surfing,"Great place if you're looking for a place to rest and spend the afternoon. The waves are pretty big too, so if you're looking for a place to surf this might be a good location for you. Parking is fairly easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lesterk96
50,Great place to relax,"Perfect beach if you want go and relax, not to many people as everyone goes to main Zuma Beach. Beautiful views and very relaxing atmosphere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bart1303
50,"Nice Beach Protected by the Bluffs, South of Zuma","Westward is an extension of Zuma Beach, extending about a mile from the southern edge of Zuma Beach. You can easily walk the entire beach from the north end of Zuma to the southern end of Westward. There is a road (Westward Beach Rd.) that connects to PCH at southern end just south of the traffic light at Busch Dr. There is a limited amount of free parking on the first half of Westward and a pay lot on the second half of the beach. Living nearby, there are endless TV and Movies crews on Westward which is always fun to see. The southern end of Westward ends at Pt. Dume cliff that many climbers use to practice their rock climbing skills. There are 3-4 bathrooms along the beach, however no fast food service. You can almost always see seals, dolphins and whales along this stretch of beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
50,Excellent first visit to Malibu,"My son attends college in Southern California and when we were visiting him he suggested we go to Malibu. I found a recommendation for Westward Beach in a tour book. It was a breezy yet beautiful Sunday in late March. Arrived at 11:00 am. Easy to park on the street. Walked as far to the left of the beach as possible and enjoyed seeing some whales, dolphins and even sea lions. Found this amazing cove. The sand was not as easy to walk in as many beaches on the East Coast, but it was good exercise Not busy, but it was a bit cool to lay out on the beach. Had a good brunch at The Sunset restaurant located right on the beach. I'll be back to this fun beach!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kap10
40,Next to Zuma beach,"If you are meeting friends at the beach, Zuma is easiest for parking and meeting point. It's harder to find an available free parking space here than at Zuma. There are also less restroom facilities available here than at Zuma.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTITL
50,"Serene, Prime Spot to Whale Watch","Insider's tip- if you are capable of walking a bit on a nice paved road, park by the Sunset Restaurant (free!) and walk in. I personally refuse to pay to park (Unless of course I was traveling with small kids or a bunch of things to carry- then by all means- pay!) During January to May whales come in very close to shore to scrape the barnacles of their bellies. Bonus is when you see their baby with them. Fun to watch the people climbing the big rock at Point Dume. For those of you who are adventurous, walk up the path where the parking lot ends and check out the Headlands at Point Dume State Beach. It is beyond cool. Especially when the water is clear on Big Dume beach below. (",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianettewells
50,"Perfect Surfing, Perfect Strolling, Perfect Sunning","I must confess I avoid Malibu's beaches on summer weekends as the crowds are beyond comprehension, but weekdays and even weekends throughout the fall, winter, and most of the spring are a true joy. You'll see whales, dolphins surfing (yes, really), sea lions, and all manner of sea bird. Surfers abound. No charge for street parking, but there is a parking lot that does charge once the streets are totally clogged. Dogs can be walked on leashes adjacent the sand, but are not allowed on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAPlatinum
50,One of the best,"Comparing beaches and the value this is a top beach for the family. It is clean has lifeguards, parking fee, of course, that is checked regularly. The sand is nice and dolphin can be seen from shore if you keep an eagle eye out. Kids love it. on a windy day the waves are gorgeous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
50,BEST BEACH IN MALIBU,"During our stay in Malibu, this was most defintely the best, cleanest, wide open beach we visited. Lots of beach, quiet, very beautiful and huge waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TraciM818
40,Love this beach,This is my go- to beach. Just make sure to buy a parking ticket at the machine if the parking booth is not open. They love to give tickets here. Dolphins are seen frequently. Water is always cold but sand is great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
50,best beach,"this beach is great, it has beautiful sand, and views. We saw pods of dolphins jumping and swimming. basically putting on a show. Love this beach",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karatetraveler
50,DÃ©jÃ  View,"Westward Beach is beautiful and if it looks familiar, it's because it has appeared in many TV shows, commercials and movies. I shot an ad campaign for Acuvue Contact Lenses there in the late 90's and have been coming back ever since. There is a famous scene at the end of the original Planet Of The Apes movie (1968) that was shot there â that showed a crumbling, sunken Statue of Liberty jutting out from the rocks. It looks exactly the same (minus the matte painting of Miss Liberty). It really is a beautiful beach. Make sure you climb over the rocks to find an even more secluded area, known as Pirate's Cove. You can also climb up to the top of the cliffs for stunning views of the Pacific Ocean. That area is known as Point Dume. There are some trails and great views in every direction. Keep your eyes peeled for dolphins. They are everywhere. And who knows, maybe you'll stumble on to the set of BAYWATCH: THE REUNION. If you do, post some pix so we can all see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/750johna750
50,A must while in LA,"Slightly down the road from Zuma beach, this is a quieter beach with bigger waves. Most beach entry is fairly steep so be careful with small kids. The views are amazing! You have a very good chance of seeing dolphins or the occasional seal. A great beach to just chill at and watch the waves. Take a hike up to the top of Point Dume to see a looonnnggg way north and south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dougontheroad
50,Family oriented/clean/quiet beach,I've been coming to this beach since I was little. It has always been a clean beach. The lifeguards are amazing. We just about always see dolphins. There is a big rock you can climb that has a trail to get to the top and look over the ocean or around it and see sea urchins and other sea life.It's beautiful and clean!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ginam45
