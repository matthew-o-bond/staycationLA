40,Comfortable trip to Catalina,"There was plenty of space for our large suitcases and it was easy to manoeuvre on and off the ferry. I get seasick so I was wary about taking the ferry to Catalina Island from Long Beach for a three-day getaway. However, I had minimal problems. We sat at the front of the ferry on the way over and played cards to pass the time, which did lead to me feeling a little unsettled. However on the way back we sat outside on the top and it was fine in the fresh air. There is a lot of waiting around after getting to the terminal for check-in, at either port, so make sure you have something like a book with you to pass the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caraj00
50,From Long Beach to Avalon,"We took the Catalina Express to Avalon from Long Beach. One of our friends traveling with us is afraid to be on a boat but she did really well with this trip. We stayed inside on the way there because it was midday, full sun and we didn't want to get fried. It was busy, I would say not a seat to spare, yet it was not too noisy. The ride was smooth and we played cards during the trip. Now on the way back we had this grand idea with hopes to see dolphins and the sunset from the deck. What we got mostly was soaked with salt spray, we were so cold and the view was ok but really not that spectacular from the deck seating. The water was much choppier on the way back and having to do it again I would definitely stay inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/taddgirl
50,Catalina Express,This was a great way to get to Avalon. Port is close to overnight accommodations and activities. Clean and always on time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/581sandyt
50,More than just a ferry ride,On both the ride over and back from Dana Point the Captain stopped to let us see a school of dolphins and one whale breaching on the way there. On the way back we saw False Whales (a type of dolphin I never seen before). The Captain said they rarely come near the boat. Yesterday they seemed very comfortable to be near us.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderingLite
50,A weekday getaway,I would defiantly upgrade to the Commodore lounge. The seats are very comfy and the adult beverages are cold. It was a nice getaway without the noise of children screaming.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulawon
50,Catalina Express,"Out of Long Beach Harbor. Catalina Express was super! Very clean and very fast. The seats were comfortable, plenty of snacks on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roving772845
50,Exploring the Island,We did several tours and walked around. The tour guide was amazing as he told the background and landmarks of the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elel77
40,Fast and Comfortable!,Going to Catalina is fun but the trip back is usually filled with drunks and is less than desirable...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoMoney2020
50,Fun ride,"It was fast, punctual, and fun. I got to stay in Catalina overnight and enjoyed the island very much. I selected a submarine tour before I left on the ferry, they had a variety of tours available while people waited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quest292536
50,On Time and As Advertised,"Took roundtrip from Long Beach. Parking in garage next door was pricy (~$40 for 2 days), but handy. Nice little restaurant in Long Beach terminal. We paid extra for Commodore Lounge seating aboard ship. It does get you a free drink and priority boarding/unboarding, but seats are about like they are for general seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NH_Joe
40,Smooth ride,"I get motion sick easily so I boarded the shuttle from Long Beach to Catalina armed with Dramamine. Turned out the ride as smooth (exceptionally so on the return trip). Of course that's largely because the weather was copperative, but I think the skill of whoever was at the wheel also contributed.Parking and finding our way to the terminal was easy, as the way was well marked. There was plenty of room, plenty of empty seats, but of course this was Dec 19... I'm sure it would have been far more crowded had it been June.All in all, good timing made for a very good experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shiredweller50
50,Post Christmas Getaway,This ferry was a very comfortable ride and its crew are very friendly and knowledgeable. The ferry is clean and modern. I highly recommend this service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvlelin39
30,Thanksgiving Day 2019,"Headed to Catalina Island to celebrate my mother's 80th birthday so I reserved the Captains room for an additional $80.00. Unfortunately, due to the weather/rain we were unable to get our drinks/snacks because of the turbulent rain storm. Weather is unpredictable but I thought we should of at least been offered a voucher for future drinks.Waste of 80.00!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RnDoreen
50,Great ride over to Catalina,The boat ride over to Catalina was nice. We picked the perfect day go over. Left from Dana Point. Everyone on board and through the check in process was very nice. Ferries were on time both going over and coming back. Only took a little over an hour. I would definitely recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorothyg883
50,Catalina Get Away,"The round trip on the Catalina Express was easy to book, easy to find, and the ride was wonderful! It was very smooth and there were plenty of places to sit!I had one concern on my trip. Before leaving Newport Bay there was a SAFETY TALK & DEMONSTRATION for the location & use of the life jacket/life vest! The young woman giving our trip THAT message spoke very, very quickly! IT WAS ABSOLUTELY SO FAST I COULDN’T UNDERSTAND HER! It was like she wanted to see how fast she could deliver that message and pop the vest over her head and pull the strap! This was NOT A GREAT IDEA! Many foreign visitors take this trip! Catalina is a paradise that many visitors enjoy and look forward to visiting! This ISN’T A JOKE! Lives depend on the instructions being delivered in a rate that similar to natural speech or slightly slower for the foreign visitors! There is liability and a job that might seem mundane or trivial can be a HUGE thing if a sudden storm or Santa Ana Winds started to blow!Enjoy Catalina! The Catalina Express was wonderful! Clean restrooms, two great bars with drinks & snacks and the trip was fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindapbAF686
50,Taken the express once for my daughters birthday,"Added someone to the trip to arrive later on the check in. Staff were very helpful, drinks were perfect, Captain of the express gets you there and back safely and quickly. Parking is easy, getting to the express from the structure is not a problem. Getting back to San Pedro everyone seems to know each other, great trip with the family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vanessasT3440QR
50,26 Miles Across The Sea ... Catalina Express on the boat to be!!!!,"Catalina Express transportation is the best! They have the friendliest crew, well-kept accommodations for the trip over and back, and wonderful drinks and food choices. Their vessels make it very comfortable and easy to get the luggage on and off. I appreciate their professionalism and willingness to help if there’s something needed. The fares are reasonable and their schedules are ALWAYS ON TIME. I can depend on Catalina Express!!! You can too!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WorksOfArt
50,Short Get Away,"The ride on the Catalina Express was awesome!Quick to to the island and back, will do it again in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G7709NJmanuelr
50,First Visit to Catalina Island,My wife and I took this boat for our first trip to Catalina. We upgraded to Commodore status for an extra $15 each. That was well worth the cost. On the ride over we even got to see some dolphins.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAPA1950
30,Timing is everything,"We've ridden the CE ferry multiple other times - years ago. They now have their own ferry landing (no longer at LB port!), with a restaurant on site. The restaurant has friendly employees and really decent food.CE certainly asks you to hurry up and wait, telling passengers to be lined up at the dock 30 minutes prior to departure time, but do not start boarding until about 5 minutes prior to departure.Thankfully, the boarding process goes quickly.The ""about an hour"" travel time between Long Beach and Avalon is more like an hour and 20. It makes it a little challenging to plan for a pick up from Lyft or Uber or even SuperShuttle.Thankfully, we picked a Yellow Cab from those lined up outside and got an excellent driver who got us to LAX in great time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholef528
50,Pleasant ride from Dana Point Harbor,Very pleasant 1-1/2 hour boat ride from Dana Point Harbor to Avalon Harbor on Catalina Island. Smooth sailing with TV's and a stocked bar for the trip. Check the schedule because there are seasonal hours. Would do it again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fran7753
40,Convenient way to get to Catalina,"Ghe Catalina Express is a pretty smooth, fast snd reliable way to get to/from Catalina. Noboby from our party of nine (ranging from 2 to 68) got sick and we were able to all find seating together, even though we were one of the last to board (on a beautiful and sunny Sunday).There's nothing spectacular about this transportation option but it is convenient. Recommend spending the ride on the back of the ship on first or second level, especially on ride back, as the view is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CroPez
40,Comfortable Ferry,"We took the first ferry out from Long Beach port at 6am and returned at 2:15pm. The parking garage was closed when we arrived so we waited until after 5am then it opened. Starting boarding around 5:30am. The facility was clean. The ferry was clean and comfortable. Only had three issues - 1) The obnoxious, loud and cackling two women and two men who sat in the middle aisle talked incessantly during the whole trip. Several other guests like myself wanted to enjoy tranquility of early morning hours and perhaps take a catnap. Due to these four annoying adults with no manners got on my nerves. 2) The second issue is during return trip gate 1 had no shade. The other gates had seating and overhead shade. 3) The third issue is the line of folks who paid extra for upgrade had one guy who lost his ticket. The ticket taker spent several minutes waiting for this one guy to search his pockets, luggage, and shopping bags for his ticket instead of allowing the other line of folks to board.Other that that the trip back was enjoyable and quiet. The restroom was clean on board as well. There are some small TV monitors that you barely see or hear anything. Plus side of the early morning trip you will see group of dolphins jumping out of the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/canyanyday
40,Catalina day trip,The ferry ride was very pleasant. The dock facilities were clean. The parking was slightly expensive for $20 day. The ferry round trip from San Pedro to Avalon was about $70 with discounts AAA/senior/military and others,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rmango2
40,Nice ferry,"No complaints... nice smooth ride for us round trip and the ship crew was friendly and professional. We travelled out of Dana Point and the ticketing and parking process is pretty confusing. You have to park in a general shopping plaza, get your tickets at the window which doesn’t open until 8:30, and then move your car to another lot.Tip: If you want to sit on the outside deck, there are a fairly limited number of seats. Arrive early and also bring a sweatshirt - it gets chilly out there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cg122
50,Great smooth ride,Vessel is clean. Enjoyed a very smooth ride and departures very timely. Personnel very friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikaempfe
50,Nice clean Ship,"This ship will do 30mph over to Catalina Island. Has a full stocked bar and snacks. Going over we sat up top , hot and more motion up there. Coming back we sat in the forward section on lower level! Perfect location on this ship!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doncN7737MQ
50,Great ride!,My husband and I planned a last minute trip to Catalina and booked the night before. Time we wanted was already booked (1030am) but decided on next boat which was at 1130. Boats are nice and timely. Staff is nice and helpful too. On the way there we had a smaller boat (which you could feel ocean movements more) The ride back was the bigger boat. (which I liked better) Fast boat ride to island!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/southerncaligirl72
50,Always Great,My wife and I have visited Catalina Island many times. NEVER a bad or uncomfortable experience. Everyone who works with this company is personal and professional.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicCouple
50,Excellent and organized,"They have it down pat! Easy in and out, quick smooth ride. Upgrade to the Commodore Lounge you’ll be glad you did!! Kudos to the gentlemen who asked for ID today on a group of underage boys. Good job!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BethMorrison6
30,Book early,"Book early or risk the boat being sold out. We booked late and couldn’t get on the Dana Point trip so we drove further and took the Long Beach route. The voyage was very safe and the crew very professional. I’m giving a low score because the boat was very dirty. Dried food on the chairs, chair trays dirty, carpet was filthy, and a piece of metal was sticking out of the receptacle in our row which is a really serious safety hazard. I was concerned if we intermittently bumped it we would get shocked (there were no other seats available). Outside of these things the trip was quick and easy. It’s a great way to see Catalina Island. Would definitely go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dupont2Traveler
50,Great customer service experience,During the July 4th weekend we definitely received great service both at the ticket counter and on board the ferry. We didn't pay for the commodore seating but next time on the return trip it will be something I will consider. Thanks Catalina Express!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Extraordinary685231
50,Great cheap getaway - didn't need upgraded seating,"Good way to leave the hustle and bustle of LA for an ""island"" feel. The boat is pretty cheap (about $40pp) and there's also a bar which is a nice plus for the 1ish hour ride. I didn't see the need for the upgraded seating option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/javidlou
40,Really Nice Rides to and from Catalina,"There aren't a lot of ways to get from the mainland to Catalina Island. Yes, one can fly, by helicopter (which may cost $270 round trip per person) or private plane if you have access to one. And swimming isn't an option for all but the strongest ocean swimmers. So for most, that leaves taking a boat. Apart from private boats and cruise ships, there are two companies that offer rides. We elected to go with the Catalina Express from Long Beach. (The Catalina Express offers two other options -- from Dana Point and from San Pedro.) The boat being a catamaran, the ride was smooth even though the ocean was quite rough on our return. The boat departed pretty much on time and arrived close to the ETA. We thought the price ($69 per person) to be reasonable, (We used a AAA discount. There are senior rates that are almost as good.) A couple of possible downsides: At least from Long Beach the parking available near the terminal is pricey (but this won't be a problem if you're arriving by cab, Lyft, Uber, etc.) If things are very busy, it's very much worth it to get in line well before departure line in order to get better seating on the boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesB9722ER
50,Great time!,"Nice ship, helpful staff, lots of dolphins. I shopped around for a good price and found one. Wish i hadn’t missed the Groupon deal.A must trip at least once in your life!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GN311
50,Sailed through a pod of 50+ Dolphins!,"A smooth, easy, and fast trip to Catalina and we even were able to sail just past a pod of 50+ dolphins jumping along in the channel between Catalina and Long Beach! An amazing and beautiful sight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattFore
40,Comfortable ride,"It's been about 7-9 years since I've been to Catalina. I don't know when the changed the boats seats. The inside seats are more like airplane seats. Rows of 3 seats on one side, Rows of 3 seats on the other side with more seats in the middle. There are over head compartments like on planes where you can put your stuff in it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Muzzysgirl
50,Quick Trip to Catalina,"Used a Costco discount for six tickets Long Beach to Catalina on the Catalina Express. In long beach we had convenient parking and a tasty bistro for breakfast while we waited for the ferry. We came back early and had to pay $5 per ticket for the change, but nice to have the flexibility. The boat was clean and quick. It was a nice smooth round trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anitan434
40,Cat Express,Just about your only public transportation to the island. Easy boarding and deboarding. You can purchase drinks and snacks on board.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnlN9105ZP
50,Blissful,"The ferry is fast and painless. The views are breathtaking. The young tomboy girl that gives the safety instructions is adorable and loves what she does. You can tell, she takes pride in her work! She is fabulous!!!All in all we had an amazing time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trebolera
50,commendable cruise,"We were ushered courteously aboard, had great seating accommodations and disembarked on time. We took the cruise starting from Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardcC2349VO
10,This ferry just cares about making money 💰,"I would not even give them 1-star, but I have no option.My family and I had a really bad experience on our last day of vacation. We bought our ferry tickets for an earlier time at 3:50pm and the person at the counter gave us the tickets for a later time, 7:30pm. When we talked to the manager at the island, Judy Rios, she didn't even want to help us to change the tickets since this was an error on behalf of their staff, she said she still would still charge us a $5 fee. This manager was pretty rude to us from the beginning and was not even willing to have a conversation with us to work it out. She started to raise her voice towards me and I had to ask her to lower her voice. She even told me she was not discriminating us because she was married to a Mexican person. At this point, my family was very uncomfortable and unsafe just wanted to leave the island. My family was discriminated against by this white manager.A few minutes later, there was a white lady who came to exchange her tickets to a different time just because she wanted to change them NOT LIKE US BECAUSE the staff did an error on our tickets, and this lady's tickets were exchanged WITHOUT a fee.It is unfortunately to have experienced this on our last day and to see that staff at this ferry service is not friendly enough and just keep saying this is their policy but when they make errors they don't enforce their policy. At least I was not blaming them for having made this mistake, I was also taking some responsibility for not checking my tickets before hand. They were not even willing to make things work and at least take some responsibility for their acts. The fact they have certain policy doesn't mean they enforce it adequately or even their staff communicates their policy to clients they are just selling tickets and don't disclose any information.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camper581642

50,An excellent ferry ride,We had a smooth ferry ride to and from Avalon. The bloody Mary’s made the ride even better! We’ll take the Catalina Express the next time we visit Avalon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Billm247
40,"Catalina Express 95 Berth, San Pedro, Catalina Island, CA 90731-3384",Took the Catalina Express to Avalon on Catalina Island and it was an enjoyable experience. The boat was clean and the staff was friendly. The only down side was when you arrive at your destination it is a free for all to get your luggage. But you do not have to deal with TSA like at the airport which is a big plus. It is kind of expensive but you have no other choice if you want to get to Catalina island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccB2213YA
50,Commador room is the best!!,"Not only do you get preboarding like first class airline boarding you also get a free drink ( hint blood marys are excellent!!)We got to see dolphins gives up a show by jumping out of the water!!! The ride was smooth, the service is first class. On the way back we saw whales too!!!!Would definitely recommend this company! First time to Catalina island, I will be back!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellesJ2976KC
50,More Than Just Ferry,We had a wonderful trip where we luckily saw whales up close to the boat. This was a bit unusual and everyone was excited. The crew was friendly and the boat ran on time. It is expensive but worth the ride.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiketoeatCincinnati
50,Day trippen at its best,From San Diego- Dana point is the best port to leave/ depart from. Friendly and helpful staff. Taking the 1st boat out was great. Especially watching the dolphins jump the wakes from the boat. We took the first boat out and the last boat from Catalina. Plenty of time to explore the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rdr698

50,Seamless and fun,"The ferry was such a tremendous experience-- seamless, fun and, at least for us, trouble free. We caught it from Long Beach. One relaxing hour later, we were on Catalina. Same was true on the return a few days later. Everything ran on time and the weather was beautiful. Lots of dolphin sightings on the way over-- a nice bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CATravelogger

50,Catalina Island Day Trip,"My hotel stay was in Newport Beach at the Marriott. For a long time, my desire was to attend Catalina Island Jazz Festival, and taking a day trip over to scout out the place for a weekend stay in October seemed like a good idea.I took the Catalina Express ferry over which took a few minutes less than one hour. My trip over was better than I expected. The staff was nice, the boat was clean, and the ride was smooth. This is a good way to meet people from all over the world. It was a nice day, I got to see a few Navy ships, but no whales were visible that day.Upon arrive in the Avalon marina, the architecture gave me the feeling of going back in time and I liked it. At this point I had not booked any activities. However, several tour operators are located right by the docks which allowed me to schedule a bus tour of Avalon. Next time I am on the island I will book activities before I get there.I really enjoyed walking through the community and down to the beach. This place is amazing. The spa, restaurants and shops all got a few dollars out of me. I had a chance to check out some of the old hotels to see where I will stay in October for the jazz concert. I found several that I like. Also, there is a late departure from the island during the jazz festival if you decided to stay on the mainland.I highly recommend visiting Catalina Island. Its Real Different” in a good way. I bet like me if you do a day trip you will plan to come back. I can visualize most of my activities for my next visit to the island. I plan to hike, bike, beach, see buffalo, para-sailing, eat good, shoot lots of photos, and take in some jazz.Peace and Blessings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GareyFields

40,Nice boat,I like the boat to and from Catalina. The seating was comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. On the trip back we sat outside and really enjoyed it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3194SQkarenb
40,"Comfortable seating, beautiful vistas and live dolphins enroute!","My 20s son and I wanted to travel round trip from Dana Point CA to Avalon, Catalina Island, but by Wednesday they were completely booked for Saturday's departure. (There are limited offerings to/from Dana Point so book early). Instead we travelled on the Catamaran from Long Beach on Saturday and took the Dana Point boat back on Sunday. I thought the $36 pp each way to be a bit steep, especially considering it is winter, but we enjoyed the experience very much. The Long Beach trip was on a larger boat - a catamaran and I thought the ride was more choppy. It took an hour from Long Beach. The Dana Point trip was on a smaller ""regular"" boat that took 1 1/2 hours and I thought the ride smoother. If going again, my preference would be Dana Point, but either is fine. We were dropped off and didn't park our car, so don't know whether there is any difference in parking availability, but was told the parking was $14 at Dana Point and $19 at Long Beach.On both boats, there was plenty of inside seating for the ride. The crew directs you through a breezeway to place your luggage. We left our suitcases and kept our backpacks with us. You then meander the boat to choose what seats you want. On the ride over, we didn't line up right away and found that there were no window seats left which was unfortunate for outside viewing. After the boats gets underway, they open a snack bar. We purchased coffee and a couple of muffins (pre-packaged in bags) for the trip over. This was sufficient since it was early and we hadn't eaten. The seat backs have trays similar to the airline and some seats have tables. They offer upgraded seats in a separate ""lounge"" but personally seems unnecessary since the trip is so short and the main seating perfectly comfortable. There are bathrooms on board. There were crew members on board who answered questions if you had any.There is a small space on both boats that are outside and I took a few minutes on both rides to go outside and enjoy the view and feel the strong sea breeze. Especially fun, was that on both trips we encountered dolphins. Heading to Dana Point there was a large pod that was jumping the wake of the boat for quite a while. On the Long Beach route, about five dolphins came along side for a short bit to frolic in the waves alongside. These sightings were my favorite part of the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MAbelini
30,Functional,"Long Beach to Avalon day returnBased on other traveller recommendations we decided to travel in the Commodore Lounge and I would also recommend this as the seats were comfortable and looked a lot better than the general seating.Dock staff at Long Beach were a bit brusk, but Service onboard was friendly enough, although the free drink and snack was not much shakes and very limited. We all had a cocktail, but if what was served was anything to go by it isn’t worth spending any more money onboard at the bar.I would say that there is nothing wrong with this service, but nothing to write home about either. We left and arrived on time both ways and had a very enjoyable and chilled out day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/louisj92
50,Excellent service,Even though the seas were very rough and several people were spewing the team provided a Stella up beat service . Good facilities and not a bad Bloody Mary for upgraded consumers,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/307viva

50,Taking the ferry to Catalina (Avalon),"Well, almost the only way you can get to Avalon. Ferries leave Long Beach, Newport Beach, and Dana Point, California. 26 miles one way, a little over an hour.Catalina Express has comfortable seating and for an additional amount you can reserve a seat in a private area.

50,Upgrade to commodore if you can,"There’s not a lot of options for getting to the island. The commodore seating is only $15 more and well worth it for a less crowded area, more comfortable chairs, better view, a drink and a snack. This doesn’t happen every ride but the dolphins really put on a show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justalegalgypsy

50,Commodore Lounge lovely,"This is the second visit to Catalina, and the first time we booked with Catalina Express. We opted for the Commodore Lounge, and we are so glad we did! Our party all received one complimentary drink and snacks to enjoy during the trips. The reclining chairs make the ride more comfortable, and the views were lovely. Highly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthasA9307VF
50,Thanksgiving Getaway,"MICK, My wonderful man of almost 8 months and I decided on a lil Groupon Getaway. We stayed at the Hermosa Inn cute older hotel. Had a great ride over and back. Must admit first dark crossing back and I was a lil nauseated, but survived.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coastal546074
50,The best way to Catalina,"We chose to leave from San Pedro instead of Long Beach, and oh what a pleasant experience. Parking is easy (but not cheap at $18/day), the terminal is clean with decent bathrooms and a small coffee shop that also offers hot food. The boats tend to be quite a lot smaller than the huge catamarans that sail out of Long Beach, but that meant that boarding and alighting only took about 10 minutes. Yep, I think I’ve found a new favorite way to get to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickrR9944JL
50,Used this great service for years.,"I travel from Long Beach to Avalon and vice-versa. The boats are clean, offer snacks, drinks and views of the ocean--sometimes dolphins appear. It is about 55 minutes to Long Beach from Avalon and the same the other way. I have been using their Commodore Lounge for an extra $15 each way--it is worth it. Good seating, priority boarding, and a drink voucher and not too crowded. Forgot to mention great service from boat staff to reservation aides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/earlya
50,Weekend getaway,"It was a round trip ticket from Long Beach port to Avalon. We opted for the upgrade Captains lounge. Which is worth it because you get to sit inside in the air conditioned area and included one beverage (with/without alcohol). You also get to board first (pick window seats).It's a fun one hour boat ride! Looking forward to another trip soon! Tip: If you are more than 2 people, I suggest you get there early because it's 1st come 1st serve seating. The people that boarded late were not able to sit together",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aaronandirma
50,"Nice ride, nice staff.",We took the ferry to Catalina Island from Dana Point and enjoyed watching the Dolphins swimming along side us. The staff was friendly and the ferry was clean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanieh85
50,Great trip,"This is the second time we used Catalina Express to visit Avalon. Although I had made a booking error, the staff at the ferry terminal quickly rectified my mistake.

50,Seemless,Comfortable and convenient ride from Long Beach to Santa Catalina Island and back. Good legroom inside and outside,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffM423
50,"A Comfortable, Easy Ride to Long Beach","We used the Catalina Express to travel from Catalina to Long Beach. The trip was smooth and comfortable, and we saw dolphins along the way. Seats are first come first served so get there early if you want first choice. You can upgrade to Commodore status for $15 and get priority seating and a complimentary drink and snack if you're interested. You spend a lot of time waiting in line outside to board so wear something you'll be comfortable in. The trip takes about an hour, no security or baggage check-in to go through; you just carry your own bags on board. The terminal is close enough to town to walk. Overall it's a great, convenient way to travel, and we'd definitely use the ferry again the next time we're on the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanogirl
50,Great ride,Fast ride to Catalina. Boat was clean and made a smooth crossing. Needed to use the overflow parking on the weekend as things were crowded. Made reservations ahead of time. Used the Commodore lounge on the weekend for a little extra comfort with the crowds. Great bloody Marys. On the way home used the regular cabin which was fine on our mid week return trip. Boarding was fine and staff friendly and helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinerdon
50,First time using the Commodore Lounge!,"We had a great experience! on the way to Catalina we took the general seats since we got on the 6am boat ride....not many people and we actually took a nice nap. On the way back we took the Commodore Lounge seats and let me say...BEST DECISION EVER!!! line was short, first people on (after handicap), plenty of space, free nut mix, one drink included, quiet, peaceful. While the general seating area was packed and crowded on the 3:50pm ride back to Long Beach.Paying extra for the Commodore Lounge it is WORTH YOUR MONEY!! great service too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noemymaciel
40,Leaving from Queen Mary,"If you are using this as part of the Queen Mary package, you have to go to 320 Golden Shore Instead of the departure kiosk located near the QM. No one on ship knew this information. Arrive at least 30 minutes ahead of time. Great service on board. Friendly staff. Worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager778152

50,Great day trip and/or weekend!,"totally relaxing, they serve and decent margarita and the beer is ice cold!! the weather was nice so we sat outside but there is plenty of room inside if you want to be out of the wind.

50,"Fairly comfortable, quick trip to Catalina","The Catalina Express that leaves out of San Pedro is probably the shortest boat ride (compared to Long Beach, Newport or Dana Point). It's easy to find, great service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/valeriebN3708FD
40,"Easy, Efficient Though Not Inexpensive Catalina Island Transportation","The Catalina Express from Long Beach was an easy to access and efficiently operated ferry to the island with frequent departure and arrival times compared to Newport Beach. Parking at the adjacent parking structure was $19 for the day. After receiving bad news requiring us to return to Long Beach sooner than planned we were able to quickly change our return time with a $5/ticket change fee. The ferry was clean, comfortable, and on time. A small concession stand aboard the ferry offers coffee and snacks and there was some table-style seating allowing travelers to spread out and play cards. Seating appears to be first come, first serve though you can pay a higher ticket fee for a faster boarding and a reserved lounge, which didn't seem worth the price to us traveling at an uncrowded mid-morning and mid-week time slot. the Catalina dock is in downtown Avalon so you can easily walk to area attractions and restaurants including places to rent transportation around the island. The ferry seemed a little pricey for a one-day trip, but my basis for comparison are public ferries in Seattle which is apples to oranges!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robinreagan3
50,Perfect boat ride to Catalina,We had a wonderful day as we took the ride toCatalina. It was a nice boat and it was perfect timing and great ride.Can’t miss.Upstairs is nice but can get windy and chilly.In the sun it’s wonderful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summersnuggles
50,Nice boat!,The boat ride was as fast and smooth as it gets. It beats the rocky boat I took with my middle school. We were lucky to see dolphins swimming right next to our boat. Our kids loved it!! The free drink was a great way to start and end our vacation!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CCExpress
50,Easy and Perfect,"I've seen many reviews mention this, pay for the Captains Lounge. It's a beautiful smooth first class boat ride to and from the island. People are friendly and professional, luggage can be stored in seperate area and coffee, cocktails and food are available on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asabados
50,Smooth and fast ride!,Commodore Lounge is the way to go! Crew was pleasant and courteous! We will always choose this way to visit Catalina!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gloriaf644

30,Vacation,"RESERVATIONS a must if you want to make the most of the cost of the trip- do not show up expecting to catch the next boat over. We did end up getting on, but were on standby. AAA also offers a small discount so don't forget to take advantage of this - you just ask for it.Also, something they don't tell you is when to be in line for the return trip- it is written on the outside envelope w tickets. Read the details.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djohn1226
50,Probably the only way BUT the BEST way to Catalina,The staff and crew of the Catalina Express are very hospitable and always have a smile. The boat and seating areas are nice and clean. Thank you Catalina Express.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chilmunk
40,Old age has caught me,"I remember when a ticket used to cost $15. Sure the ride is faster, the accommodations better and the scenery is still great. No matter what the price this is a must do once kind of experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/woodbd
50,"Great way, fast boat","Great ride, upgraded to the admirals lounge on the way over (really not worth it as they lock you in the upstairs cabin until boarding is complete, unless you want the free drink) There are much better views from downstairs and off the back Wesaw dolphins (porpoises for those in the know).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jansonjj
50,Great Ride,"The staff is professional and very attentive. Easy comfortable trip to the Catalina. Both trips to and back were prompt. Plenty of choices of drinks and snacks on board. Bathrooms remarkably clean and well stocked. I took the one from Newport Beach, parking is close to the pier, an easy walk even with luggage. I would use them again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jillwA2357KK
30,"Summer visit to Catalina, Long Beach to Avalon by Catalina Ferry boat","My advice is to place your ferry reservation by phone and get General seating, then arrive early to line up for seating together for your group/party. Online reservations don't reflect the actual seat availability. Speaking with a person on the phone can help you find a seat and time to suit your schedule. The Commodore seating was nice to try once, for the priority boarding only, but unless there aren't seats left in general, save your money for the island. The Commodore seating was one level above ""steerage"" LOL, (seats are just as nice below in General), but the included ""free"" beverage (12 ounce cup) and cookie (a package of Famous Amos cookies) included with the Commodore ticket weren't special. It was like snack time in Kindergarten. I was expecting a real cookie, freshly baked and chewy soft. In the entire ferry, music played overhead, the staff were helpful and friendly, restrooms were clean, and we arrived safely to Catalina and back which is what matters most.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachandForest
50,The Commodore Lounge,"We had excellent service from the moment we boarded the boat to Catalina. We had upgraded to the Commodore Lounge, which I highly recommend. The seats are more comfortable, better views and you can enjoy appetizers and wine. Our group left from the Long Beach port. We just wish the ride had been longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianaw580
10,Tickets,"This company makes you give them your credit card to reserve your tickets and once you buy them IN PERSON they “void” the amount off your credit card. Well, it’s been four days since they charged me TWICE for the amount and have yet to void it even after I have paid in person. So basically they have charged me three times and have made my credit card max out, making me unable to use it on my vacation. I have called probably 20 times everyday to get the charges taken off the account and I either don’t get an answer or I get dead end answers that don’t help. Unfortunately my vacation has been ruined. You’d think the stupid company could make this easier on everyone and just have you pay for your tickets right away instead of making you reserve them, but no. Let’s make it difficult!!!!!!! Absolute trash of a company. Still haven’t been able to get ahold of ANYONE who can help. EVEN MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY HASNT BEEN ABLE TO FIX THIS BECAUSE THEY NEED COOPERATION FROM CATALINA EXPRESS WHO DOESNT HELP. TRASH. TRASH. TRASH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K8510CYanag
40,Begin your trip on the cruise over to Catalina Island,Catalina Express is a ship leaving from 3 different locations in So California going to Catalina Island. Our trip over to Catalina from Long Beach was great. The ship was clean and comfortable. There were snacks and beverages available. The ride was very smooth. Don't worry if you are prone to seasickness. The pier in Catalina is only a short walk to all the shops and restaurants.The excursion desks at the port are very convenient and the staffs are super helpful. This was our first trip in 40 years!

40,A summer boat ride,"Departed from Balboa terminal on a slightly overcast Friday morning. Fortunately the water was smooth so the ride was uneventful.If you're planning a trip to Catalina Island I would recommend departing from Dana Point vs. Balboa. The traffic going to and from Balboa Island makes a long day even longer.Overall boat was clean, crew was friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9396TEgregc
50,Another Great Ride ⛴,"We left from Dana Harbor on Monday morning at 9:40am. The ride was a bit rough and 3 of the 5 in our family were sick. The crew had warned us the swells and wind might make for a bumpy ride. They were very accommodating for those feeling sick however, and handed out bags, ginger ale and crackers. Thankfully no one lost it!Here are my top 5 tips:1️⃣ book early and on-line! Overheard several people get turned away as the boat was already booked.2️⃣ allow extra time to park! You must first park in the lot by the office to get your tickets and parking pass. Then someone must move the car to the lot down the road and walk back - this is about 10 minute walk.3️⃣ if you are prone to motion sickness, take a Dramamine! Out of our family of 5, the 2 that took Dramamine did not get sick. Also, sitting upstairs outside or downstairs in the back is the best bet. And keeping your eyes focused on the horizon or mountains helped a lot.4️⃣ plan to line up early if there is a particular seat you want or if you have a large group wanting to sit together. This especially goes for leaving Catalina.5️⃣ don’t forget to take pictures! We were so busy chatting we forgot to get pics of the coastline as we headed to Catalina, and then did it again as we left Catalina 😢 The views are amazing both ways!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolofam4

30,It's a ferry,"Pretty boring ride, guess it would not be good if it was exciting. Seems like the chairs used to be more comfortable. All the kids fell asleep scrunched up in chairs in the waiting room then on the boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolccCNA
40,Nice Ferry Service to/from Catalina Island,"We booked our ferry rides in advance out of Long Beach Port. We also paid extra for the upgrade to Commodore Lounge. We got to the Port about an hour before and I did think they would start lining us up earlier than they did but the ferry also did not leave right at the hour, it seemed a little delayed. The seats are nice and comfortable and the service very good in the Commodore Lounge. They give complimentary small bag of snack mix and a small bag of cookies. The attendant takes drink orders as soon as you sit down and since I did not use my beverage ticket in the beginning, he remembered and checked with me a bit later. I was happy to move around and go outside for windblown hair and the fresh salty air! There are restrooms outside of the lounge.Only negative, to me, was I had a small carry-all (the type with rollers and a handle) and they made me keep it with the luggage. That was a bummer going over bc I had my book and snacks in there. I learned and carried the book with me on return trip.The trip was fast and most of the time there's something to look at whether it's the coast in the distance or the Island. We did see some dolphins when approaching the Island. It's a quick ferry ride - about 50 min to an hour total.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suemichel
40,Transportation to Catalina Island,You check in at least a minimum of an hour in advance then line up and wait. It would be nice if they had better seating etc. especially for seniors. It would was a pretty trip both ways. We went on the first vessel out of Long Beach to Catalina and on the last one out from Catalina back to Long Beach. It would be nice if somehow they could share information about the area as you are traveling. Get in line early or it could be difficult to find seats together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/26marilynf
50,What a joy ride!,"Such a fun ride to Catalina, skimming across the waves, letting your hair get whipped into knots on the back deck and then relaxing with a cold brew as the island approaches.

50,Nice boat ride to Catalina.,I first went on my birthday which was free at the time. If it hadn't been free I probably would not have gone. They've discontinued the free boat ride on your birthday and they shouldn't have. It was a great way to get people like myself to check out Catalina. I've gone seven times since that first trip on my birthday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciajO2506BK

A credit to the crew and management.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G6426FManthonys
50,Great experience!,Catalina Express is a great Ferry service. We took the ferry from Long Beach Port to Catalina. The staff was polite and friendly. The ride was very smooth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzie623

50,Company outing for the day.,"We took the ferry from Dana Pt. The ride was very smooth, although there were a few among our group who got motion sick even with some over the counter meds.Those of us on the top deck outside were a bit cool but had a great view of 5 pods of dolphins that came over to jump in the boat wake. A hat, and sweater and wind breaker is good for sitting outside.The total time on the water was 1hr 10 plus about a half hour from our arrival at the dock till we were on the boat.Still it's a great way to visit Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoryGuy
50,First Class!,"There are three locations to board the Catalina Express from the mainland; Long Beach, San Pedro and Dana Point. My Bride and I left from Dana Point on one of the smaller boats, not the jet catamaran which goes out of LA. At booking we selected the Captains Lounge upgrade. I thought this would be a dozen or so people in a special area, but it turned out to be a private cabin, drinks included! A steward welcomed us as we boarded first, took us to the cabin, got us settled in, explained our perks then got us our first round before we left port.On our return voyage the Captain even allowed us to visit the wheel house. Yes, it’s a few extra bucks, but if you are traveling with up to eight people the price is the same. We will be back on Catalina Express in the Captain’s Lounge again, it made the trip so much more fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briangT3877AF
50,Super Easy Way To Get To Santa Catalina,This is an easy way to get to the island. You can book tickets in adavance or walk up too. The staff are friendly and you can purchase refreshments on board. It took us about 55 minutes to cross. Seats are comfortable but not luxurious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lio-et-Ben
50,Round trip with smooth and warm trip!,Easy on and off and storage for luggage. Love the warm smooth ride. Very polite and helpful staff. Very nice & clean facilities. Easy parking on the mainland side. Near the Queen Mary.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeatherColoradogirl
50,Catalina Island trip,Good overall experience. No complaints. They have snacks and drinks available. Prices are not bad. Cabin was clean as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJTAS
30,Just a ferry!,"Catalina express is one way and the most popular way to get to Catalina island. We booked round trip online for Labor Day. We got our ship from Long Beach. On that day it was overcrowded, the parking lot was full and closed and we were asked to park somewhere else. We didn't know our way to get to our terminal.it was confusing and no signs, nobody to help. Eventually, we missed our ferry and we were scheduled for the following one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/173hanyg
50,BACK TO THE FUTURE,"I was a lucky kid from the 1950's prowling the decks of the SS Catalina until the steam whistle signaled we'd arrived in Avalon... and how times have changed! From the comfy 'Commodore' chairs on my recent return to the island via the 'Express,' I was impressed by the power of the jet boat and how more quickly we all reached Avalon! Catalina Express gets my five stars because their perfect service was an important part of a perfect island vacation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patrickmL222RN
30,"Comfortable, quick","Catalina Express has grown from a single boat to a fleet of modern, fast (28-32 knot cruising speeds) passenger vessels, carrying from 149 to 450 passengers. With service from San Pedro and Long Beach, it is, overall, easy to find and user friendly. Long Beach has good parking in a structure adjacent to their (relatively new) terminal. San Pedro, not so good - parking is about a 10 minute walk away, meaning drop off your luggage, go park, walk back. There is decent eating in Long Beach, not gourmet but better than fast food, should you wish to arrive early and then have breakfast etc.Boarding and disembarking is a bit of a cattle call. They seem to usually to have you line up a good half hour before actual boarding begins. If it's a hot day, that isn't great fun as there isn't much shade at Long Beach, a little more in Avalon. The boats are clean, comfortable and as mentioned, get you there in a bit over an hour. There are snacks on board including (limited assortments of) beer and wine. Upgrading to the ""Commodore Lounge"" gets you first boarding privileges plus one snack (trail mix, pretzels and such) and a beverage. Getting off, it's every person for themselves. Still, it's convenient, way cheaper than flying and fun to watch Catalina appear.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobsacerdo
40,You're Only Option,"The Catalina Express is great. It gets you from Newport Beach to Catalina Island in about an hour. The only downside is that the inside is hot and smells like food, so I recommend sitting up top outside. If you do this, be aware that the sun is beating down on you for an hour each way.If you don't want to take the ferry, there is a helicopter option but it is limited. I recommend taking this though, as it is a fun experience to a great island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike_Macrone
20,Wish There Was Another Option,"This boat provides transportation to Catalina but seems barely clean and very outdated. it would be nice if it went faster and had more amenities for the price. It does the job but to park on the San Pedro port cost 18 dollars a day! It seems there is no other place to park. It is an outdoor not very secure lot. Catalina expresses Charges a 5 dollar change fee per ticket and 5 dollars to get a refund of the ticket. I wish there was another company or two that could provide service so there would be some effort to do things better. They have passengers line up waiting for the boat and there is no cover or sun protection or rain or wind protection and it takes a long time to get passengers disembarked and the new passengers on.It is a rip off and not very nice nor clean. Bare bones.Crew is always nice, however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lattejr
50,A Great Excursion for a Day in Southern California,"We were like many people who say they know about Catalina Island but have never been there. So this time when we were in Southern California we decided that we would be intentional about doing it. We weren’t disappointed. We booked the Catalina Express and found the experience to be fun and interesting. We made the reservations online so all we had to do was show up, wait for boarding and enjoy the boat ride out and back. And the time on Catalina was made enjoyable by renting a golf cart and taking a tour of Avalon. We saw as much as we cared to see in the time allowed, had lunch, went through the museum and still could wander a bit in the shops. We were glad we finally made the effort and traveled the “26 Miles Across the Sea.”",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/169richardo
40,Basic Transportation,"If you want to go to Catalina Island and do not own a boat or chartered one, chances are, this is the means that you will get there. Basic transport, it gets you from point A to point B. There are restrooms and snacks to purchase on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nolig734
30,To and from Avalon,"Going to Avalon, Catalina island, we had an uneventful ride, which was great. But while coming back for the 6 PM ride to Long Island, they were delayed by over half an hour. It was bitter cold, and we were freezing. No one notified us of anything or how long we were going to be delayed. Finally, when they let us in, everybody started booing. But once inside, it was warm and there are plenty of chairs for everyone. The bathrooms are clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elvor
40,Efficient way to get to Catalina,"This is not a sightseeing boat, but express boat to get to the island. We took a boat leaving from San Pedro to Avalon, which took one hour 15 minutes. It was not cheap – about $70 a person – but the service was friendly and the ride efficient. You can buy drinks and snacks on board if desired. The views from the top deck are nice, though it does get a little chilly in the winter. Unfortunately, there was some animal hair left on the seats we sat on. Real service animals and even emotional support animals should not be on the seats, so hopefully the staff takes note of this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaymtravel7
50,Fast efficient transport from Long Beach to Catalina,"Web site worked well: desktop and ipad. Lots of selections of times and seatings even though booked within 12 hours of departure. Was easy to change booking at Avalon. Not cheap: parking also charged for. Both our travels directions were very smooth. Crew courteous and efficient: this is just transport, not a ""cruise"" or sight seeing tour with narration.For fast transport with quite a few options, this company performs well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/artthiel
40,Loud but pleasant view,The express was loud but the scenery is beautiful. Snack bar is disappointing so eat before you come or save your hunger for the island. Crew is as courteous.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747christib
50,Fast travel to Catalina,"Took the 1st morning trip from San Pedro. Booked the Captains Lounge. Water was smooth and the trip was fast. The San Pedro location has the V hull boats versus the catamarans out of Long Beach. I believe we paid $80 for the Captains Lounge. If you want privacy and to be able to talk with Capt. while they are driving then this is the room to book. The cost includes a free drink and is a great upgrade from the commodors lounge. If you have 6 guests you will actually save money by booking the Captains lounge versus the Commodore, plus you will have more privacy. Take the first boat so you can spend the full day, there is a full day of touring to do there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timg103
50,"Nice ferry, watch the dolphins!","We took this ferry from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island and back. The ride was comfortable, the crew friendly and the cost reasonable. The captain even pointed out dolphins (lots of them) on the way there, and a beautiful full moon on the ride back. We watched a football game on the way back in their heated cabin. Very nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RDM12345
10,Terrible Customer Service,"We caught the 2pm ferry to Catalina Island from Long Beach on October 22, 2017. They recommend you check in 15 minutes before and we were running late thinking we wouldn't make it. By the time we parked and walked up it was 2pm and boarding had not even began. We were relived to make it but the ferry didn't leave until 2:30pm! We had to wait in the HOT sun for 15minutes!!!Our return ferry 3 days later (October 25, 2017) was scheduled for 11:45am and it was another HOT day. We figured if we got to the pier at 11:45am that would be plenty as there was NO shade. We got there right as planned but we saw the boat starting to leave. I ran over and waved them down and the crew almost waited for me but they looked at the Captain and he didn't even acknowledge anyone. He just stared straight ahead. They could have taken one minute to let me and my parents board but they didn't. We had to wait for the next ferry which wasn't until 3:50pm. The customer service lady at the desk showed no sympathy and said we had to pay an extra $5 each to get on the next ferry. I was very upset as we did the responsible thing and booked a round-trip ticket in advance even though it doesn't save you any money. If I had bought a one-way ticket then there wouldn't be ANY extra fee. Horrible customer service! A better way to handle the situation is to apologize and upgrade us to the first class lodge and we would have been fine. It would not have cost them anything and they would have put our frustrations as ease.Anyhoo, we got to the ferry early this time and the 3:45pm ferry was 15 minutes LATE we had to stand in the HOT sun!!!! Very disappointed and will NOT be coming back to Catalina Island as the gas fueled carts are super stinky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lissylou2014
50,Fast...Comfortable...Ride,"We took this for our first Catalina trip, leaving from Long Beach terminal. Parking close to terminal.Very professional, fast and comfortable. Conveniant schedule for departure and return.We paid the extra upgrade fee which offers VIP boarding and drinks/snack in private seating area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rogerinca2003
40,Smooth ride,We rode the Catalina Express for a day trip to Catalina. The ride was smooth and relaxing and the view was beautiful. There is a bar onboard for drinks and snacks. The only thing that I disliked was waiting in the hot beaming sun to board the ship.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/454adriennej
50,It was Great,"Well Catalina is a island so you clearly have to get there by boat. Me and my family had just arrived in the parking lot of the docks. We walk through a set of doors and another set of doors then we are outside. As we get out the doors there is about 50 people standing in line to get on the boat. I would have thought with how expensive the tickets were, we would be getting right on. That was not the case here. We stood here for about 10 to 15 mins and finally got on the boat. The boat was clean and had a lot of seats. No one was crowded everyone on the boat had a comfortable seat. As we pull off the docks it seems like the Catalina experience starts there. There is a choice between the upper deck lower deck and the back of the boat. We chose the back of the boat and I'm glad we did. The boat seemed like a rollercoaster ride. Up and down up and down as we rode the waves like a surfboard. I have seen oceans on tv but, nothing compared to this sight. The water was a dark navy blue, and i had actually seen dolphins jumping in and out the water. This sight was marvelous to me as i had never seen open water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966calebw
50,Simple transport to Catalina,Big ferry company. Boats are big and handle waves well. Lounge was nice and service is good. NOTE: the day we went to Catalina was the LB marathon and they emailed different driving instructions that worked perfectly in tough traffic situation. Well organized company!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark_Victorville_CA
50,Beauty at Sea,"We (family of 5 - 4 Adults and a 10 year old girl) enjoyed our trip to Catalina Island and back to the mainland. The trip to Catalina was on a sea almost as smooth as glass and we saw 2 pods of dolphin, very exciting. On our trip back to the mainland the sea was a little choppy, but the trip was still great. No one on the trips either way has any problem with sea sickness, & ordinarily 2 of them get motion sick in a car. The crew were very professional & cordial. The trip took approximately 1 hour each way. We are looking forward to another trip in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanaqlts
50,"Don't need to travel far, only an hour away & a great getaway on your birthday!","Just spent an unforgettable birthday on this island! Catalina Express offers ""birthday deals"" - the birthday person can travel for free if you are traveling TO the island on your EXACT birth date with a purchase of another ADULT ticket. You are saving $73.50 round trip fare, right there, and some more if you use their many birthday promotions that they offer. Please check their website for details. However, all of this is available, only when you make reservations prior online. Also don't forget to ask for ""the Birthday button"" at the terminal before boarding. Without it, chances are you will not be able to receive the benefits of the birthday promotions once you are on the island!Tips: 1) We took the one from Long Beach, but be sure to arrive early. Parking could be hectic on the weekends ($17) and also better to be in line early to board to assure good seating on the boat. (if you are seated outside it could get very cold, but might be good if you are afraid to get seasick, but that shouldn't be an issue, usually a smooth ride!) 2) With 1) in mind, be sure to select the right boat for you to board on your return trip, otherwise you will not have enough time to spend on the island. People start lining up an hour or more prior.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
40,Really convenient,Catalina Express was really convenient when going to Catalina Island. The only bad thing is that they give you the specific times for you to leave to Catalina Island and to come back is not like you can come back whenever you feel like it but when you have to. If you contact them over the phone it completely sucks!!! I kept on asking the lady over the phone questions because she wanted to charge me again and she would always give me the same answer and would not answer my question. At first I was completely disappointed until I got to the window at the harbor the staff there are really friendly and helpful unlike the ones on the call center. My family and I were able to go to Catalina Island and come back to LA safe and sound. I do recommend them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariajosem394
50,Can't imagine a more enjoyable day cruise,"Effortless online reservation, easy to find departure point if you know where to go (signage is minimal), expensive day parking (be warned it's $17 for the day and expect to sit in a LONG queue when you return in the evening to get out of the parking garage), and fast travel to and from Avalon to Long Beach. We upgraded to the Commodore Lounge for the return in anticpation of being tired after touring Avalon and it was worth the xtra $15/person--included a snack and a beverage (Chandon sparkling wine split among the expansive choices). Last time I went it was a minimum of 2 hours each way--35 years ago!--now advertised 1 hour 10 minutes but reality is more like 1 hour 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roamingbears
50,Catalina express trip,"A delightful 1 hour trip from Lomg Beach to Catalina Island. Dolphins played in thw wake of the boat. Need to be early to line up for a seat on the upper deck. Friendly, helpful staff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/725karle
50,Great ferry at a reasonable price.,If it's a sunny warm day sit outside. Bring a book to read or other form of quiet entertainment. And get here early.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajbukovitz
50,Reserve in advance and get there early,"We reserved only a few days in advance, and naturally there was limited availability. Company doesn't charge your credit card right away-- puts a hold on card and then makes full charge when you check in.If the website says sold out, call anyway-- they often have cancellations, which on our trip could be done up until 6 PM before day of departure. Telephone service was quick.Driving to and parking at San Pedro is usually less of a hassle than Long Beach, but when we arrived at San Pedro lot, it was full-- not even a handicapped space. If you see ""lot full"" sign, believe it. Turn around and take the first left before Harbor Blvd. and go into World Cruise/ USS Iowa lot. Ten minute walk to ferry dock-- shuttle available.Ferry ride was pleasant. Plenty of seats, even on a summer Saturday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sudstattler
30,How about some shade,Overall our trip was fine but the wait to board in the hot day with no cover was unpleasant. Not just us complaining. You would think with the number of customers the company has they could build some covered areas. Maybe spend some of that profit that a monopoly has.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bjnz2017
50,HIgh Speed Cat to Catalina is the ONLY way to go! And do it on your birthday!,"Woohoo! The Catalina express is the ONLY way to go to Catalina. It's moderately priced and gets you from Long Beach (our departure point) or San Pedro to the Island in less than an hour. Ample seating, good space, smooth ride, and courteous staff. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip.We're not sure what the parking arrangements at the terminals were like since we had friends drop us off. You can get a taxi or just walk when you arrive in Avalon.Two important points:1) Book ahead! Although the change fee is only $5.00, it is important to book ahead to ensure room on the vessel. Some of the trips are completely full as this is a popular way to travel.2) Go on your birthday! If you go on your birthday, your ticket is free. Your companion or partner pays regular price, but it will cut your overall cost by half! And you get a snazzy button saying something like, I'm sharing my birthday with xxx!"" Folks, this birthday thing is a deal -- just do it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Skipjack906
40,Place has been really fixed up,"Have been going to Catalina for over 30 years. Lived there for a while and haven't taken the Express out of San Pedro for at least 7 years as Long Beach has been the schedule that worked best. The San Pedro terminal is beautiful. User friendly with a great ambiance being created. Palm trees, comfortable seating and what looks like a putting green and bocce court being constructed to perhaps pass the time while waiting?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcslatts
40,"Great operation, but Commodore Club a waste.","Commodore Club seems like a good idea when you're leaving the island, as you get to board before everyone else. But then the entire boat disembarks at the same time, so unless you feel a drink and a bag of cookies is worth $15 per person, I'd pass. Also, to get there just act as if you're going to the Aquarium of the Pacific and follow the signs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SundanceMountain
50,Timely and well organized,"first, make reservation first. space is limited, thus, online or phone to make reservation.second, leave earlier in the morning, traffic is bad, no matter what time in LA area. gosh, I almost miss the ferry! leave enough time for traffic and parking. you do not want to regret.parking is $16 for me, they directed me around the parking structure and went to a lot behind, since I will leave the same day. from the parking lot, I went across the parking structure and reach the ferry building. (not bad) in the afternoon, when we got back, no one attend the parking lot I parked, looks like an employee parking space. anyway.same, we were stuck in the traffic on the way back.but anyway, the ferry service is good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindalH8945HB
40,Smooth sailing.,"Which port to use for Catalina Island? Long Beach or San Pedro? I chose Long Beach because the online reviews were better and coming from the Los Angeles area, the difference in distance was nominal. Covered parking is very convenient and just across the street from check-in area. I suggest that you take advantage of the loading zone if you have a good size group especially if you have large bulky items such as coolers, beach toys, and luggage. The drop off curb is right in front of the Catalina Express office and the ramps make it convenient to roll your stuff up, this approach may make your trip easier since there are a lot of people waiting for the elevator at the parking structure, you can bypass the other travelers by taking the stairs down and walk across the street to meet your party.Unfortunately, general seating was sold out for our departure (8:00am Saturday) but they still had available seating in the upgraded Commodore lounge so we spent the extra money since we had no choice. Our return from the island to Long Beach was general seating so it was an interesting comparison. The Commodore Lounge is in the upper deck, the ride was quiet, nothing too fancy other than the Champaign and snacks as part of the price. They also offer water, juice, coffee, and soda. Snacks was a choice of spicy peanuts or Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies, I went all out and ordered the bubbly wine with cookies!On the way back from the island, I noticed that it was a different docking area and ship (significantly smaller). General seating was on the lower deck and considerably noisier, we could hear the engines spin louder once we left the harbor at Avalon and entered open water but the ride appeared much smoother than the morning. I could not tell any difference in our chairs or the amount of leg room in general seating compared the Commodore Lounge. About 10 minutes into our travel, most of us could not keep our eyes open after a long and exhaustive day and nodded off so we did not miss our late afternoon Champaign and cookies. 65 minutes later, we were in Long Beach, what a nice experience – I wish air travel could be as nice.Our overall impression of Catalina Express was good, they are professional, courteous, and on time. These are basic ferry vessels, don’t expect something at the level of a Disney Cruise ship. We did take advantage of their birthday special allowing our family to save a little money. This was a solid 4 star rating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamescL2481PM
50,Timely and well organized ferry service,"My hubby and I rode the ferry last Sunday from San Pedro, it was a fun activity for a Sunday spending the day on Catalina Island. Even though there's a lot of people it was well organized and didn't seem crowded. All the people we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Only thing call for departure/return times early we didn't get the time we wanted but worked out because it was a cloudy start to the day but beautiful when we got the island. Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DReadFindlay
30,Typical Ferry Service,"There is not a whole lot of choices to get to Catalina Island from the mainland. The Catalina Express does a good job getting people back and forth. The staff are professional and very helpful. It's the passengers that will kind of make or break your trip. People tend to act like ""savages"" when it comes to loading and unloading. Everybody wants to be first and they bum rush the entrance to try and be the ""first one on board."" I try and be patient and board after the crowd, realizing that everyone who bought a ticket for that trip time will get a seat. However, my wife and I had trouble finding a seat together. It's the people again...taking up every other seat and ""manspreading"" on some of the bench seats so no one else can sit by them. We eventually found 2 seats together after searching the top and bottom areas. And because they offer food and beverages, it turns into a feeding frenzy and people feel they have to have that bag of chips and soda. The ride to Catalina is only an hour and 15 minutes. I'm sure if they really thought about it, they can do without the junk food for that short period of time. Getting off the ferry is the same, with people rushing to be the first one off. Nevertheless, good ferry service, clean restrooms, and all at a good price.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davyboy75
40,Efficient ferry service,Great ride on the way to Catalina Island in the morning but the afternoon ride was very hot. They need to get more air circulating in the cabin.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseW2110
50,Fast clean and friendly.,I usually take my own boat over but this time I went to meet a friend on her boat. I had no problem figuring out the online reservations and there was plenty of room Saturday afternoon with only about 10 passengers. I found the wait staff and bartenders friendly and helpful. I ordered a Bacardi and coke and it was only $6.75 which is cheap compared to airline and restaurant prices. I sat on the top deck to look down on the water and was fortunate to cross paths with dolphins. A smooth trip for 1.25 hours. The one way trip from San Pedro to Avalon is less than $34.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sailing_Sweetie
40,Great ride,I reserved with my 17 year old as he wanted to scuba dive. The terminal is clean with restrooms and a snack bar offering a nice selection of food. The boats are clean. The staff were nice. The ride from Long Beach is about an hour. My only complaint was standing in the hot sun in Catalina for the return trip for about 30 minutes. I would definitely take the Catalina Express again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8730YMsharonm
40,Smooth sailing,"Booking via the phone, arriving, boarding, travel, and departing worked like clockwork. The ride out from San Pedro was smooth, swift. On the return, we were able to watch the sunset over the pacific, Parking in San Pedro was easy. We will do this again next time we are in SoCal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ablesambaker
40,SUPER RIDE IN THE COMMODORES LOUNGE,The ride in the Commodores Lounge is great and very nice.Boarding the ship early and in a sepatate line is great. The beverage and snak service was quick .

40,A Great Way to Get to Catalina,"Catalina Express is the most popular way to get to Catalina Island. If you are planning a trip during the summer, especially on the weekend, plan well in advance. There are only so many seats available and they fill up quickly. San Pedro may not be an attractive area, but it is the closest port to the island and the trip takes a bit less time. San Pedro also has some early departures if you need to arrive early in Avalon to make a tour connection. There is abundant parking. Just be sure to save some cash, because it will cost you $18 to exit and it is cash only. If you are over 55, you can save $3.00 on your fare.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rharch
40,Very efficient operation out of Long Beach,We had a group of six and found this ferry service to be very efficient and comfortable. The price was reasonable (~$75 RT) and there is a senior discount. Would recommend to purchase tickets early as both boats we were on were sold out. Two of our group waited too long to get tickets out of Dana Point so we had to change to Long Beach sailing (which was done very efficiently). We did pay parking at $17 for the day trip we took so be prepared for that. All in all a Catalina Express ride over for day trip to island was a fun time and well worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derbyking98
30,"Old, dirty and outdated","The people at the ticket boot and ticket pick up area are rude and unprofessional, the ferri it self is ok but is very old, dirty and outdated.You definitely need to book in advance your trip, but is very easy to do so in the website or via telephone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PattyFirenze5

The boarding was easy and organized (maybe need some shaded areas to wait both at Long Beach and in Catalina) and the boat ride was smooth and on time. The crew was helpful and friendly. There are clean restrooms and viewing is great from any seats! I would take this trip again anytime! Especially on my birthday! What a great deal!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/87pamelah
50,Long Beach to Avalon,Everything was great other than the $17 per day parking! Highly suggest The Commodore Lounge- considering that you are getting a free drink and snack the $15 extra is almost a wash.

50,Long Beach to Avalon,"We took the express from Long Beach since it had the most frequent schedule. Staff was nice. Boat seemed clean.

Overall pleasant experience although I think it's a little over priced, but so are most of the ferry rides, imho.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thehep
30,Stormy weather,"There was a storm and so we were asked to stay another day on the island. The Catalina express actually canceled it's pick up. This wasn't a bad thing, this was actually a pretty great thing that we were stranded. It was rainy and again it was stormy weather. What was hectic was that nobody could give us an answer about gettingtickets so we can get home and that made it a problem. We had the hotel staff intervene and call and coordinate our tickets home on the boat.When we actually got on the boat the next day, we were told that our boat caught fire and that's the real reason that we couldn't get off the island. Catalina express didn't have a back up boat to take us home. It was also problem because they wanted us to take another boat with another company and go to another port which was two hours from where our car was. Interesting",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladc2001

In the future I might consider commodore lounge upgrade if its in the budget.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STP95008
40,Comfortable trip to Catalina,"The Catalina Express from Long Beach was a good experience. The waiting room in Long Beach was clean and the seating was comfortable. They have a restaurant there which I did not try. Getting on board was an easy experience and the seating there was comfy with a choice of indoor or outdoor seating and enough room to move about. There is a snack bar on board. Some unruly passengers were dealt with quickly and appropriately diffusing the situation in moments. Our ride back was equally comfy but the outdoor wait with no cover was a bit of concern. We were lucky that it wasn't hot or rainy. Some of the wait areas are covered, but not the wait area for the Long Beach boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/270Pat_C

50,the way to go!,"We have taken the Catalina Express before, it is a comfortable, reliable and affordable way to get to Catalina. This particular trip in february was post-California storms.. so we had very rough seas. The crew handled it so well! made sure everyone had bags in case they needed them, retrieved some ginger ale or coke for those asking, and they just kept an eye on all of us to insure the best possible trip! When we arrived at Catalina, they also reminded us that the trip back to Dana point will be much easier due to the way the waves go... that really boosted everyone's spirits! Anyway... kudos to the crew for a job well done! btw, the trip is normally very pleasant.. this was rare for it to be so rough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SKnBK

The rid over was very smooth. On the way back we sat very comfortably in the Lounge Area, which was inside.We didn't stay over night but there was plenty to do for the day. We rented a golf buggy and did a tour of the island. In addition to that we went on the glass bottom boats, which was fine. We never knew this beautiful place existed until a friend told us about it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinahej
30,"Beautiful Ferry Ride, Average Island","The ferry ride to Catalina Island is really nice and relaxing. Our captain even pointed out a whale swimming nearby and slowed the boat so we could watch it. The island, however, is really not all that. I was disappointed with how little there is to do on it. The scenery from the island is beautiful, but the overpriced shops and restaurants are all clustered in front of the harbor, which makes the view from the water rather unappealing. I much prefer Mackinac Island in Michigan where motor vehicles are prohibited, and you can take your pets on the ferry with you and even take them on a horse and carriage ride around the island. It's prettier, too, and offers many more activities and touring options.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plmanning

Recommend to upgrade to the Commodore Lounge so you get comfier seats, a free drink and some snacks. ($15 extra each way)There is an additional fee for parking on the building and they do not take AMEX cards. (not affiliated with Catalina Express, it is an independent parking building)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicazyoung
40,"Comfortable and fast, good customer service","Due to weather and other circumstances, my travel plans were changed on both my travel to, and departure from, Catalina Island, so I had to change my reservation twice. The people at Catalina Express were extremely pleasant and helpful, and the process was painless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Deni51
50,Good experience,"First visit to the island. Easy transportation. We arrive to long beach and took the catalina express. Check in was easy. Boarding was a breeze. Inside was comfy staff was friendly. Met a few of the island locals on the boat: a man who lives on the island, others who own a store on the island and a few musicians. Which was cool! They gave us the inside scoop of the island and best things to do and in exact order. They made us feel like family. Once arriving at island getting out of catalina express was a bit crazy but we managed, due to an amazing guy who was an island local. He told us to get up and walk to the luggage pick up line before the boat completely stops at the island (this was about 5-8min before boat stopped), and this helped!!! We got up and followed him and stood in line (we were prob the 10th person in line) waiting for boat to stop and waited to be allowed to get our suitcase. the line to get your luggage and get out the boat is crazy! But due to this man and his amazing tip we were in n out the boat quickly. I felt bad for others who waited until the boat stopped and they had to deal with all other passengers getting up from their seat and get in a really loooooong line and had to hunt for their suitcase. I Will definitely riding the catalina express again on my next visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariahN1038FA
50,Very fast way to travel back to the mainland,"We used the Catalina express from Catalina Island to Long Beach over the years. It's about a 45 minute ride back to the mainland. We used to just buy the tix at the terminal in Long Beach. Then our last visit in August 2010, we discovered that you could take it from Newport Beach which is much closer to Anaheim than Long Beach (closer to LA). We booked online and took the morning boat and then left Catalina around dinner after a day there. There is a good amount of times to leave throughout the day, but we like to spend about half a day there before returning. Great views of either Newport Beach or Long Beach and Catalina Island when arriving and departing. Lovely way to spend a day on the ocean and enjoy the warm SoCal weather too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariedesjardins
50,Efficient,I like this service because it operates precisely on time. You need to call to book same day tickets but can do most other bookings online.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BalikpapanRain
40,Efficient Way to Get to Catalina,"Catalina Express operates from Dana Point, CA and Newport Beach, CA. They provide frequent service during the summer but have limited operations during the winter. We usually travel from Dana Point. The offsite parking is time consuming and a bit awkward but its reasonable. Shuttle service is provided between the parking lots and the small terminal. Its best to take Uber or Lyft to avoid the extra parking and shuttle time. There are some good restaurants near the embarkation point and the area around the departure pier is scenic. The trips over are fairly uneventful. The seating area is a bit cramped on the smaller boat used for Dana Point. You can upgrade to get larger seats but the cost is considerable. Luggage is handled efficiently. Its the only way to get to Catalina other than chartering your own boat or going to Newport Beach or Long Beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/richardb827
40,Quick ride to Catalina from SoCal,The Cataliina Express is an easy and quick ride from Long Beach/ San Pedro to Catalina Island (I have taken off from both ports). I would recommend upgrading to the lounge. It is worth the extra dollars and you get a snack. Plus it has AC and in bad weather would be a much more comfortable trip. You also get to ride FREE on your birthday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouiseASL
50,Quick and Relaxing Experience,"On a last minute trip to the Island, there were plenty of choices on when to leave. We were watching the weather to pick the right departure that would have the smallest swell. The big Catamaran in Long Beach is the way to go. Very smooth ride and a really quick trip. I even came back at night, which was a peaceful and relaxing experience. The staff was friendly and really made the experience great! Can't wait to do it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LML1985
50,Just great!,I loved going from Long beach to Catalina. Such a nice view of the sea approaching the island. Want to return soon!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karimexicogdl
50,First class service,"We took a weekend trip over to Catalina on the Catalina Express. From check-in to trip itself, all very professional. Consider using the Commodore Lounge for more comfortable traveling.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JamesUKUSA69
50,First Sea Experience on Catalina Express,"We were a family of 5 adults and decided to visit Catalina Island through a cruise ship Catalina Express. This ship has 3 floors Fully-covered, Half-covered and Fully-Open floors. The fully covered one is warm/hot for a cold day journey and has a two snack/beverage serving counters in 2 separate floors. The journey was about an hour from New Port to Avalon port.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Im_GPS
50,Perfect day visit,"Our extended family of 14 spent a memorable day traveling to and fro Catalina Island on the Catalina Express and exploring the island on foot and local bus. The ferry is comfortable on deck and only take just over an hour each way. Coming from the mountains, it was thoroughly appreciated. We bought sandwiches and drinks in the little town for our hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merryhell36
50,Interesting Day Trip only an hour away by boat,"We took the Catalina Express on Tuesday December 27, temps were in the 50's, seas were calm. Only an hour boat ride. I tend to get seasick very easily, so took a non-drowsy dramamine an hour before we left, sat in the back of the boat, outside for fresh air. No problems with seasickness! We arrived in Catalina about 11 am, back to Long Beach by 8:30pm. More than enough time to do the Food Tour from 12 - 3, walk up to the Wrigley Memorial gardens (3 miles RT), and still have 2 hours to shop & have dinner. A busy day, very tired when I got home.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janetmreynolds
50,Great rides,"The most popular way to reach Catalina. Large, fast, comfortable boats with inside and outside seating. Pedestrian only - no cars.There are ferries to Avalon from Long Beach, San Pedro, and Dana Point. There is also a ferry from San Pedro to Two Harbors. In the current off-season (until April 6, 2017), there are at least 4 ferries a day between Long Beach and Avalon, starting at 6am. There are additional ferries Friday to Sunday. There is 2 ferries between Dana Point and Avalon on Friday and Sunday, and one ferry on the other days. There are 2 ferries between San Pedro and Avalon and Two Harbors, every day except Tuesday and Thursday. In the high season, there are more ferries.

50,Great Weekend,Went to Catalina on the Express for my birthday weekend. Was absolutely wonderful to get there in record time. The service on the Comodore Lounge was excellent. Will definitely travel with them again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255nuryr
50,Day Tripping on the Catalina Express,"The Catalina fun starts with the boat ride from Long Beach, CA. Round trips are $77 adults, $65 seniors, and $56.50 kids. The boats are all windows and comfort as you head out into the open Pacific. When you reach Avalon Bay, the water is crystal clear and sailboats moor off pocket beaches along Crescent Ave. Yes, it's full of tourists, but so many activities, parasailing, water and land safaris, fishing, and diving, give everyone a special experience. These cost money, but I also found a town bus that took us up the hills to a botanical garden and the Wrigley Memorial for $1. The ocean view was spectacular, but three deer hopping right by us stole the show. The boats go daily and often, but you should make reservations, and weather can change the schedule. Parking is $17 for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817edaz
50,Excellent ride great view,"This is one of the best ways to get to Catalina. Frankly I don't see why people are complaining. It's a rid that has lots of seats and average food and drinks. And maybe some turbulence, but not much by comparison with other trips around the world ☺️ friendly staff and great view. You can go upstairs for a better view:))) we stayed at a hotel in long beach, but if you have to park it's usually $17.00 for the parking. Enjoy the ride☺️",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/395faranakm
50,Do not ride if pregnant or sensitive to motion sickness,"Nothing against Catalina Express itself, just want to notify riders that if you are sensitive to motion, or if you are pregnant, you will get sick. The ride to Catalina was horrible for me, not sure if it was overwhelming because too many people, the idea of an hour ride! or a bit of a bumpy ride, but I got very sick! I stepped out a bit to get some fresh air, seem to help a bit, not quite. I was sick the rest of the evening and the next day. However, the ride back, we took the 7:30pm ride which was a bit smoother. Didn't get sick on the boat, but did afterwards. I do not suffer of motion sickness, so I can only blame pregnancy. I rated 5 stars because on any other day, this would have been a nice enjoyable ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NanciG16
50,Gift yourself free ride to Catalina Island,Free to and fro ride to Catalina island on your Bday. The entire boarding process is very seamless and staff is very welcoming. Departure is on time. Great way to spend your bday,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KartikJain13q
50,Relaxing little cruise to Catalina,"I love Catalina Express-especially upstairs. A little on the pricey side but worth it. I have taken this boat over to Catalina 4 times now and each time was a perfect experience. Friendly staff, great drinks, and of course the view is to die for. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/756stephanieh
50,great day on the water,we had a fabulous trip over and back last week. weather cooperated and had smooth sailing both ways. be aware tho parking in their parking garage is $17/day. the staff and crew were courteous and knew their jobs. so no surprises. would recommend these guys to take you to catalina [but that island is another story and review],https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tndawoods
50,Free Birthday Ride,Catalina Express really lives up to its name. It's a quick ride over to the island and they run very smoothly. I actually slept the whole way back. Open seating is easy but get there early if you want a window seat. The free bday trip is totally worth it and they give you a guide to all the free birthday stuff around the island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RachelAMullins
50,Fast and Friendly Ride to Catalina,"You don't have a lot of options in terms of how you get over to Catalina Island, but the Catalina Express is definitely one of those options. As we are coming into the port on Catalina our captain so down the boat so we could check out a family of dolphins riding the waves with us.The schedule is timely and the hour and 20-minute ride is a nice way to relax on your way to and from the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJBlondie
40,Easy access to Catalina Island,"After reviewing several alternatives, Catalina Express from Long Beach proved to be the best option and the most convenient. We ordered our tickets online through the website and received very detailed information that was helpful. You need to select your times for departure and return, but the variety of times gave us flexibility in our day. Seating was available inside or out with the inside seats very comfortable and warm if you were traveling back in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfox55
40,Wind in your hair,Just an average boat ride for a slightly pricey cost. Professional and pleasant staff. Seats may be a bit narrow for larger folk. Beautiful views but cold so make sure yoi bring a sweater even if its a warm day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travettep
50,Great Way to Catalina Island,"I traveled from Long Beach to Catalina Island, and back on this well-appointed vessel. I was fortunate enough to upgrade to the Commodore Lounge, where up top one can enjoy the views while having refreshments and snacks during the approximately 1-hour journey across.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/antonec2018
50,Mid Week Birthday Trip,I have been wanting to go to Catalina on my Bday for years and it finally happened this year. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! I did online reservations with no problem. I left out of San Pedro and only spent the day there. I met so MANY people with the exact same Bday as mine. It was so much fun. The staff and ride were great. You not only get your fare for free but there are other freebies and discounts on the island for your Bday. They give you a Bday ribbon to wear. Plus on the ride to the island I saw LOTS of dolphins and flying fish. On the sunset cruise back I saw a pack of seal lions heading to the mainland.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaSnorkelQueen
50,Fun ride,"We've made several trip to Catalina Island and always ferry from the Golden Shore, downtown Long Beach Terminal (only 15 minutes from Long Beach Airport). The Long Beach terminal is very nice. The boats are roomy with big windows so that about every seat is a good one. I book online with Catalina Express and every step, from booking to travel, is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/903stephanieb
50,Fun Pricey Boat Ride,"Riding the Catalina Express is part of the Catalina Island experience. The boat is fairly comfortable and the crew are quite obliging. They seem to be sensitive to the motion sickness prone and are attentive as such. There's a full bar and snacks available for purchase. If you're lucky, you may have porpoises cruising next to your boar for your viewing pleasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RktDogg
50,Birthday celebration,Great trip. Loved that my friends trip was free for her birthday. The crew V were great and very helpful. Quick easy b and fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747marlynm
50,Fun Day trip!,Gorgeous island! Lots of things to see and do. Rent a golf cart to get around quickly. Lovers cove is great for snorkeling.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/solar2you
50,Two Tips from a Travel Writer,"Catalina is one of those great stay-cation destinations for Southern Californians. Exotic with beautiful vegetation and roaming buffalo in car-free small island vacation town. Catalina Express' scenic ferry rides from Long Beach, San Pedro, and Dana Point are part of the getaway experience. Tip 1: For just $15 upgrade to its Commodore Lounge as a bargain way to kickoff your holiday in style. You get a free drink and a comfortable seat away from the crowds in air conditioning. Tip 2:bundle the ferry ride with one of its partner hotels, then the ferry is practically free.Bon Voyage!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drjlever
50,Birthday day trip!,"Was well worth it! I went for the first time on my birthday with a few friends. I got a free birthday ferry ride there and back. Left out of long beach, had a lot more times to choose from than Dana point. Plus Dana point sold out faster. The port in Catalina was super easy and straightforward. I wish we stayed longer than just a day. I will have to go back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pungalo2016
40,Quality Experience,"This is a quality ferry experience that is extremely popular. It is somewhat pricey, but I traveled on my birthday which entitles you to a free round trip ride as long as you begin on your birthday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SalC701
30,Don't forget a sweater!,Good service. Interior was very cold for the evening return trip. We froze our buns off. Take a sweater!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichelleRP2016
50,Another great trip to Catalina Island,Always a comfortable ride to Catalina. Seats are always comfortable with a fold out food tray. Nice snacks and drinks available. Luggage is easily taken on and off with plenty of help near by if needed. Always plenty of boats available so getting to or returning from Catalina most every couple of hours is no problem.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aerocopter
50,Zooming out to Catalina!,The Catalina Express is a fast boat that clips along to Catalina Island. They were prompt and efficient with ticketing and loading up the passengers and all of their luggage. The trip out to Catalina is fun and seemed to end way to soon. The boats are very well-maintained an the crew is helpful and pleasant. We left from the Dana Point Dock and that was a lovely place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeborahM680
50,Way to go from San Diego,"Their birthday program this year is great, and since one of us got to ride for free because of her birthday this was a great trip over to the island. Personnel on board is friendly and helpful for all those who get a bit seasick. They are well prepared for that eventuality. Sometimes the ride is smooth and sometimes choppy for the sensitive. I must say restrooms are also very clean considering even those party-hearty riders coming back to Dana Point after a day or more of partying. I am sure they know how to handle all situations with good will. At least that is what I observed on my round-trip. The arrival/departure set up is as promised - Right On Time! Be late and you miss the ride to Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChiWind
50,"Good ride, easy trip.","Thanks to the captain of our ferry ride from Dana Point to Avalon. When we ran into dolphins toward the end of the trip, he announced that there were dolphins, and he steered the boat off-course enough to connect with and ride along with the pod so passengers could enjoy their breaching and swimming antics. Great fun for our grandson, along with us on the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5903NPwilliamd
40,First time,"The trip from Long Beach to Catalina Island was delightful. The ferry was pretty standard looking on the inside, but sitting outisde on the deck, letting the wind whip around your face was fabulous. Weather permitting, I'll always ride on top. Only one con: $9 mimosa!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michellegN6992FJ
30,Efficient service!,The boat trip over is convenient and the staff efficient. I thought the boat was a bit tatty. The window that we sat next to was leaking onto the seat and the table was well worn. The kiosk could also offer a better selection of snacks I thought.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyg789
50,From Long Beach to Avalon was a fun ride across the bay...,"This was my surprise for my birthday. We took the Catalina express to Avalon and my wife gut us the Commodore club. Which is seating on second deck inside. you get a free drink and snacks for the hour long ride to Catalina. And we got to watch the olympics along the way,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rickczap
40,Catalina Express,"I traveled on the Catalina Express with a group of friends scoping out the distance and the nature of St. Catalina Island. Our round-trip ticket only included disembarking at Two Harbors....BIG mistake! It's a rustic village meant for campers, hikers, snorkelers, and fisherman. We should have been in Avalon, the town where there are restaurants, shopping, and lodging. The island itself is rather barren and almost desert-like, but this destination does provide picturesque photos of the Pacific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgwelsh61
50,California Adventures,"Ferry from New Port Beach round trip was amazing. Staff was very friendly and explained everything in detail (safety, snacks, etc). Highly recommended it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelalS3609IQ

50,Best Way to Get to Catalina Island,The staff is so friendly & helpful (except for the lady who checked us in at the Long Beach Terminal...but we will just ignore her! I'll chalk her behavior up to a bad day!) Upgrade to the Commodore's Lounge - it's nice and quiet and not as crowded as downstairs; plus you get a drink ticket & free snack & priority boarding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SBayKat
40,Fine but bring a sweater,This ferry was an hour long and had a smooth ride. I was worried about my 14yr old getting seasick but he was fine. Didn't appreciate some of the moms letting their kids run rampant throughout the isles of seats. Get seats facing the stern of the boat so you can get a tan or warmed up by the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BargainHunter247
50,SUPER ENJOYABLE,"Comfortable seating both below and up in Commodore Lounge. Can sit inside or out. Grandsons loved their first big boat ride, The Commodore Lounge is well worth the little extra money. Loved that there were many different times both going to Catalina and returning. Would definitely do again , IF there was something to do on Catalina which there is NOT, but I would do just for grandsons to have the boat ride which they loved",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josL7740YS
40,Quick Trip,The boat crew was accommodating and friendly. They ensured your safety at all times. The ride is as smooth as can be expected. If you feel queazy at all they sell Ginger Chews on board which are amazing and can really settle your stomach so that your ride is enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandraaj2016
50,Wonderful Ride to Catalina,"Catalina Express is a fast, comfortable and lovely way to get to Catalina Island. It sets the mood for your adventure and is highly recommended. The fleet is modern and clean with comfortable seating. The staff is excellent. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deborahlynnt
30,"Efficient ""Greyhound bus"" of the Ferry boat's","The boat ride was efficient and fast to Catalina Island. Going to Catalina the staff was pleasant, coming back they treated everyone like cattle. Even to the point of talking loudly about their least favorite interactions with their guests/patrons. Impatient, rude and truly not polite or helpful in guiding you to load of offload gear from camping on Catalina.I also felt somewhat unsafe with the vague instructions as to where to find life jackets or PFD's onboard, especially for the children-sized life jackets. It was not made clear, and staff disappeared into an ""off limits"" captain's cabin where you could not find anyone to ask about them.Had the staff been pleasant and directed us in a helpful way to loading our camping gear onto the boat, it would have been a stress free trip. In particular one staff member chastised me just one second after asking to see my ticket to hurry up and not ""hold up"" the line as I placed the ticket back into my pocket to continue carrying heavy camping equipment on-board, with multiple trips off and on again to load up. This person's attitude was that of annoyance overall with the people making their way onto the boat.Someone should make management aware of their lack of professionalism. This also speaks to the safety of this vessel. Careless staff make more mistakes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaweedSara
40,Quick boat tide,"It's a about an hour boat ride to Catalina from Long Beach (another boat leaves from Newport). Comfortable seats, snacks and a bar onboard.$72rt pp. upgrade of $30 for VIP seats/lounge.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HotPocket505
50,"Best ""I'm On A Boat"" Ride!","On-time departure, expert crew, smooth and comfortable (even wen weather conditions create more choppy water), and a fast hour from mainland to Avalan Harbor: just enough time to enjoy a famous individually made Bloody Mary (with the best green bean in the world)!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/652rayq
40,Dana Point the way to go for South OC or San Diego,"An hour drive from San Diego to Dana Point and much better than trying to get to Newport Beach or Long Bach. Older ship but worked fine. The downside is parking and their shuttle needs improvement but all things considered, we do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snorris57
50,comfortable ride,nice ride to and from Catalina Island. friendly staff and on time. We decided to leave earlier than expected and were put on stand-by. worked out great!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lucy2967
50,smooth ride,we rode on the larger boats and had a smooth ride both going and coming back. Taxis are outside the terminal at long beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BandiB_13
40,Express yourself,"Overall the Catalina Express is an easy transit from LA/Long Beach to Santa Catalina Island. We opted for the Commodore Lounge roundtrip which came with one drink alcoholic nor non-alcoholic and allegedly a snack. i say allegedly as we never were offered a snack. That said, the lounge was booked to capacity but we were able to secure window seats each trip. Some of the tray back tables are broken and the windows could use a good cleaning but the sets are cushioned and of a better quality than those available to the general passenger.What stood out most was how unfriendly the cabin attendants were. Both going and coming, the women who served the drinks were robotic, not particularly personable and not friendly. Their job is similar to that of a flight attendant so I recognize that at times they need to be all business, but serving me a drink in a plastic cup with a tip jar prominently displayed seemed a bit tacky. IF I WANT TO TIP YOU, I can without your prompting. When I am on a plane, the beverage cart doesn't have a cup labeled tips with a a $5 bill jammed in the top.Overall the interior is clean, and the boat was well maintained and on time. The passing was smooth with a couple of dolphin spotting and for that alone it was enjoyable. I think next rip we will try the helicopter for a little variety.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chictraavel
50,smooth trip,"Smooth trip over and back. We saw a few dolphins and seals. Both of us took Dramamine II (less drowsy all day formula), and were very drowsy for 24 hours. On the return trip, I took nothing and was fine.Many people were traveling on their birthday because they received a free ride and a free scoop of ice cream.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cr1717
50,Dana Point to Catalina - Easy Peasy,This is a very well run island bus ride. The crew was excellent both directions and it was so efficient that we didn't notice the time. On the way over the captain noticed a couple of pods of dolphins and made it possible to watch them for as long as we could and we still arrived on time. Great way to get there and we will only use this company. Dana Point Harbor is full of excellent restaurants but the one right off of the CIE dock was excellent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolmh874
50,Channel crossing with speed and style,"There are a few choices to get to Catalina Island, and the most popular and affordable is the Express. Their terminals are well designed, comfortable and educational (yes, they have exhibits and loads of information about the Island); the food courts, particularly the one in long Beach, are excellent too.The boats are comfortable and fast, offering two levels of comfort. Outside decks for nice days, and spacious insides are the norm. Bathrooms are clean and the staff's attention is great.Having done the trip many times over the years, it is my preferred way to get to the Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosLdelaRosa
40,Nice Ride!,"Took the 7am ferry from Dana Point to Avalon on Saturday morning. Even though it was sold out, didn't feel too crowded. We arrived about 6:15am and checked in and got parking pass. We were then able to head to Starbucks for quick breakfast to go. We got back, parked and stood in line. By now it was about 6:45 and there was quite a line but we were still able to find 4 seats together downstairs.The ride over was a little rough. I always take non-drowsy Dramamine so I was fine but there were several people, including kids, that were not feeling so great. The crew is extremely attentive and were very quick to bring bags and free ginger ale to anyone needing help. The travel time was 70 minutes.The arrival into Avalon is beautiful! Right off the boat is a golf cart rental, which was great to tour the island.We returned on the 2pm ferry and started lining up around 1:30 and boarding at 1:45. We literally left the dock at 2pm. They do not wait for late-comers. The return ride was 75 minutes, of which most people took a nice relaxing nap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yolofam4
50,Great beginning to Catalina Adventure,"The boat is small enough to allow people to sit next to windows for a great view. It all seems well-organized and hospitable. We had a delicious local beer on board, which created a festive feeling for the beginning of the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquaBend
50,Like Flying Across The Ocean,"The Catalina Express is a fleet of sleek airline-like passenger vessels with inside cabin seating and upper deck open air seating that provide transportation from the Southern California mainland to Santa Catalina Island.One of eight islands in the Channel Island archipelago, Catalina is home to the resort city of Avalon - our day trip destination.We boarded the Catalina Express from Dana Point Harbor for Avalon. Booking the trip is as easy as picking up the phone. The reservation agent was very professional and helpful.Unlike some reviews claiming that Catalina Express has a monopoly, there is at least one other service, Catalina Flyer that operates from Balboa Village in Newport Coast. As Balboa Village is closer to our hotel, we would have utilized this service except that all available trips on the days convenient for us were already booked.Travelling from Dana Point Harbor to Avalon, my wife and I chose the upper deck open-air seating. On the return, we chose the indoor cabin. That experience was simply amazing. The indoor cabin is designed so that the cabin floor is close to level with the ocean surface. So as the vessel wisks along, you have the sensation of flying across the surface of the ocean. Just sit back, relax and gaze out at the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tjcnewyork
50,ONLY WAY TO GO,"We (wife and myself) chose taking the Catalina Express to our Catalina vacation. Why you ask. Here's why. It is normal to have some overcast skies over the island and if so, the flights are usually canceled or rescheduled. It can get kind of rough on the ocean but, in our case, both coming and going was as smooth as glass. These boats don't mess around and the 26 miles usually takes about an hour and fifteen minutes. Much of this time is getting out of the harbors and back in again as there are speed limits within harbors. We, if ever we were to Catalina, would not hesitate to use the Catalina Express again.

10,"Terrible customer service, Monopoly, overpriced","8 reviews1.0 star rating 5/18/2016By far one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had. My wife and I went o Catalina for Anniversary. I was shocked at the almost 200$ cost because the only return tickets were The Commodore, lounge, fine, its our anniversary. The going to Catalina was ok, nothing special. On the return we arrived at 2:55 and waiting in the extremely hot sun, as no shade provided for 20 minutes, agin whatever. The ramp opened and the ages took our entire tix and one of our drink coupons, I assumed this was normal. We arrived at The Upper Lounge and The woman attendant barked "" Where are your stubs? Why only 1 drink coupon?"" I informed her the agent took them and responded"" you can't be here, need to leave!"" very rudely. I informed he we paid and she didn't care. So I spend me email receipt and tried to show her, she refused. Meanwhile a huge line of people formed, chaos. I found a manage as we could not sit. He finally retuned with the stubs and graciously let us sit down. The rude lady returned, scowled and said, "" Its company Policy"", no apology, no drink, no apology from manage. This Company has a monopoly and the don't care. I wrote corporate, no response, why would they, they control the market. I will NEVER give them my hard earned $ again, horrible company",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danodiver
50,Great experience a must take to Catalina,This was a great trip over to Catalina and back. Comfortable seats and a clean inside. One thing that is hard is standing waiting to board. You have to be there early but they don't board till about 10 minutes before you leave so a long wait and it was a bit warm. I think they should have you wait in a covered area with seats. My legs and back got very sore. Staff very nice and respectful,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648jackieg
50,Great Trip,"Our round-trip travel for our day trip to Catalina was easy and comfortable. The ride was pretty smooth, despite some sizeable swells, and it was just a bit over an hour from San Pedro to Avalon. We saw a few dolphins on the way over. Crew and ticket staff were friendly. Overall, we'd definitely take Catalina Express again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VtaTraveler
40,Free on your birthday!,"We took the Catalina Express from Dana Point on my husband's birthday. I had to pay of course, but the $12 a day parking was free with the handicap placard. So a good deal all around. They have a very good system from the ticket window to the ferry crew. We even saw a pod of dolphins on the way over.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
50,Nice Seats! Champagne and Great Bloody Marys AND DOLPHINS ALL AROUND!!,IT IS FREE ON YOUR BIRTHDAY!We thought we were getting on a simple ferry to cross the water to the Island but were happily surprised to find it had nice seating both inside and out.Champagne! Mimosas! Bloody Marys!!!! That made our trip...well...almost...because when we were in eye sight of the Island we got the pleasure of have about 50 dolphins shooting out of the water in a synchronous water dance around the boat. I would have paid for this...it was fabulous!!!The crew is also very happy and fun and careful to insure everyone is a) safe and b) enjoying themselves.LOVED THIS PART OF OUR TRIP!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/L1941PFrebeccac
40,Great Crossing,A crowded ferry and a cool wind made the outer decks a bit uncomfortable but the crossing was smooth. The return journey was spectacular with the sun setting behind us and Pacific White-sided dolphins racing ahead. The pursers and the trest of the team were attentive and able to respond to all our questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/optimisticbob
50,Birthday weekend,Took Catalina Express out of Long Beach no one got six and had great bloody marys also seemed like it was quicker than coming out of Newport.We took Catalina Express because we were returning on Monday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaB540
40,Great Way to Travel,We have not been on a boat like this before. WOW! - it can really travel across the water.Reasonable amount of room and the seats are comfortable.All very modern and high-tech.Overall a very good experience (although the fares are certainly not cheap),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobandJosie
50,boat to catalina!!,"we've gone to catalina a couple of times and we like the ferry ride there, it gets a little chilly but we love the view, can't wait for the next catalina adventure..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurapO2775WI
50,Always Top Notch,"Short of personal watercraft or a pricey helicopter ride this is the only way to Catalina , that being said Catalina Express is always safe , reliable and professionaly run. The crew are helpful and courteous. An additional 25$ RT gets you in the Commodores lounge, a free beverage and a cookie included . The real value is boarding before the masses, especially on the return voyage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/459jamesp459
40,Quick service to Catalina,It's a boat ride so not too much to review. We were lucky that both crossings were very smooth and the weather was great. Service was good with boat leaving and arriving on schedule. No complaints. Nice they have a ride for free on your birthday promo so I plan on going again on my b-day (what better way to celebrate than a trip to Catalina?),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Cali Vacation,"Great ferry very big and stable. Got alittle chilly on the way back but stayed on deck, love the breeze and the views! Crew was great and very accommodating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RickH168
50,Great boat ride!,"Many may not know but if you go on your birthday, you get a free boat ride, a great saving. People were so nice that worked for catalina express from the person that helped me with our reservations to the one that took our ticket. Even though it was stormy looking with lots of clouds, the ride was smooth and pleasant. Plan to go again some time for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Departure808739
50,"Smooth, friendly and on time",Never went to Catalina Island before. For those traveling to the Catalina Express be sure to follow the directions they give you....don't follow the apps out there for directions. We made the mistake of taking Google's advise and we ended up in the ship yards at a dead end. Luckily a friendly shipyard worker directed us out and from there we followed the directions given. I was very impressed with the service and ease of travel. Going back again in March!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LEM1200
40,"Expensive, but great views!","Nice calm boat ride to Catalina Island, but very expensive! Wish there were less expensive means of getting on the island besides a helicopter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanSane84
40,"Expensive, but a Good Boat","First off, I think it's great that they offer a free ride on your birthday!I asked some island natives if there was anyway to get discounts for this boat, but they said generally not. One native suggested checking the Catalina Flyer (from Newport) because they sometimes have deals on Groupon. However, it looks like the Flyer has a much more limited schedule compared to this boat.We took the ferry ride back in September during the heat wave, on that trip we opted to sit outside on the upper decks. It was quite enjoyable sitting outside in the sun.My husband and I decided to take a trip here for NYE and spent a couple of days on the island. We booked our ferry tickets about 1 month in advance, I did notice that they were sold out on the day that we traveled. On this trip we opted to sit inside on the first level since we had a piece of luggage with us and it was chilly outside. We grabbed some seats that had a table in front of them, they were quite comfortable. I found the ship to be very clean.We did have our small dogs with us and they did ask me if I had a muzzle when I boarded. We have a small Shih Tzu, this breed has no snout, but I purchased a muzzle off of ebay for a few bucks and carried it with me. I put my smaller dog (5 pounds) in an airplane travel bag. I did notice that some people had there dogs muzzled when they boarded.My husband did get a bit queasy on the way over to the island, but I think it was due to the fact that he was staring down at his cell phone screen. I have a sensitive stomach, but the ride over and back were totally fine for me.It is a bit costly to get over to the island at $75 round trip, but it's very peaceful once you are there.We will definitely be taking a trip to the island again in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
50,Not cheap but great service and punctual...and you can purchase an adult beverage..👍,I've traveled in the Catalina Express several times over the last 7 years or so. Service has always been punctual. The boat is clean and comfortable. You can sit outside or inside in air conditioning/heating.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U1930DHmichaels
30,"Very pricey, but smooth and timely","Purchased tickets to Two Harbors because they were the cheapest form of travel to Catalina Island.Due to the price of the tickets and the non-contact from the company concerning possible ferry cancellations I can only rate 3 stars.Had we not received a call from our location in Two Harbors, we would have had no idea of ferry cancellation.Ferry itself was a smooth ride. We were only two of about 20 or so. The boat is large and would hold three times that. It was clean and comfortable. Thankfully we were going to Two Harbors, because leaving LA the first stop is Two Harbors then on to Avalon. It takes about an hour to get 26 miles to Two Harbors, plus at least another 30 minutes to Avalon. On our return trip, the ferry had already stopped at Avalon, so we only had an hour of time back to LA.They do have snacks available, including alcohol, for purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adcjones
40,Good trip,It was a good trip we took on Catalina Express.We reserved the tickets on line but this time of the year you probably can get on board as you come basisYou have to park your car $12 paid to Catalina Express walk 10 minutes from parking lot.Parking next to the ferry is allowed for 4hr so you have not choice but pay.The ride was smooth 1.5 hourReturning the same day 4.30 to Dana Point last ferry of the day.Beautiful view of full of lights shore.Dana Point in Christmas Spirit nicely Decorated with Christmas lights.The island is wonderful worth another review.Top marks for service .Price reasonable senior and student discount.Enjoy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/slabinskic
50,Catalina Express,First time on the Catalina Express. Great sitting up on deck. Fun seeing the island as we got closer. Coming home on the 4:30 was smooth as glass.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2118GXjoanneb
50,Watch out for the animals!,"i am in a wheel chair at the moment and the crew made this such an easy trip for us. they boarded me first ( thank goodness because the ramps leading to the ship would have been very difficult for me!) At the end, they were right there smiling pleasantly to help me once again. the ride was smooth and the day lovely...great crossing.the only problem we encountered is that pets can board with their owners and we were seated right next to the beginnings of a dog fight...scary. Otherwise, what a nice way to begin our vacation on Catalina Island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandaceR9
50,BEST ride to Catalina,"The CATALINA EXPRESS boats are the best and most reliable way to get to and from Catalina Island. Clean, very comfortable ride with excellent staff. The short 55 min. Trip is delightful in either the Commodore Lounge, a slight extra charge for seat in upper cabin, or in the regular seats on first level. I live in Newport Bch, but always take the Long Beach Express because they have so many different times they leave and return to mainland, where as the Catalina Flyer out of Newport is once a day and....they take no dogs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shesailor1
50,Quick Trip to Catalina.,"We booked the Commodore lounge and it was worth it on the way out because there was a crowd and you could board first. But if it is not crowded, it probably isn't worth it. We sat outside because my friend gets seasick. It was a very pleasant ride and the drinks are good. The parking is $15 a day and only if you stay under 3 hours will you pay less than that so you might want to look at the timing of your sailings. But Catalina was so nice it didn't matter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J283QBnancys
50,Fantastic for a Day trip or longer,"We had a great experience taking the Catalina Express to beautiful Catalina Island. The ship left on time, getting to, and waiting, at the terminal in Long Beach was convenient and comfortable. Considering the amount of people on the ship we loaded very quickly, it was very organized and they had a special area for luggage. Pulling into the Island you getting a million dollar view of the marina and the town of Avalon. When we left 2 days later, again we had a great experience. This time we stayed at the back of the ship so we could enjoy the view of the Island as we left, with the wind and the ocean spay in our faces we had a blast. There is plenty of seating both inside and out, so you can have a comfortable trip wherever you choose to sit. We used the ""Super Shuttle"" to get us there and pick us up, which worked like a charm. One last bonus, if it's your Birthday you ride for free!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rawnyd
50,Outstanding Service,I was especially pleased with their frequent schedules and the fact that there was more than one departure port to choose from. The ride to and from Catalina Island was very Smooth and Comfortable. The crew was extremely friendly and very accommodating. I felt safe at all times and the fact that they allowed elderly and disabled passengers to board first was indeed a plus! I would defiantly recommend them and use them if ever I am in town again!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mytyia
50,Definitely take advantage of the Commodore's Lounge!,"For a little extra, definitely recommend traveling in the Commodore's Lounge. Excellent service, comfy chairs, priority boarding. Would definitely travel this way again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/574lisaz
50,"Easy, great way to reach Catalina!","This boat is very comfortable and staff are fun and courteous. There is food/drink available onboard. It is kid friendly and safety conscious. We took the trip from the port in Dana Point. Sit in the main cabin near the front, gives good views and easiest access to all other parts of the boat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriplePisces2
50,A great start to the day,The Catalina Express was so organized and a really comfortable ride. I would highly recommend to upgrade to the Commodore Lounge. It's a slight increase and that includes comfy seats and a complimentary cocktail. Ride over was maybe an hour and smooth the entire way.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomasviska

Free rountrip to catalina Island, free dinner, free coffee, free ice cream, free botanical garden visit... Great two for one tours... and just found great hotel accommodations so no need to rush...

40,"Reliable But Not ""The Steamer""","Although the Catalina Express is a monopoly, they are organized, professional, on time and give you a fun and pleasurable ride to the island. I have been going to Catalina since I was a kid. I remember the Catalina Steamer in the 60's & 70's and miss that fun, exciting, bon voyage experience. When you took ""The Steamer"", it was a definite event you will never forget.Does anybody else remember ""The Steamer""? The live rock band rocking the ship once it left the harbor. People dancing and having a fantastic time on the 2 hour ""ship of dreams."" The photographer taking family pictures. (We still have our black & white one). Does anyone remember the mariachi band welcoming you when you pull into Avalon? Does anyone remember ""The Duke"" (a local who looked like Yul Brynner) and welcomed EVERYONE when the steamer pulled in and said ""Hello Neighbor.""Catalina was a magical escape back in the day. On The Express, the captain did steer the ship to a dolphin pool which was very cool, but The Catalina Express does not have the magic and mystic The Steamer did. They are a reliable, get you there and back transportation company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1_Cabo_Fan
50,Smooth sailing!,"The trip was smooth sailing (literally). Service was good, and adequate parking in the lot. They even serve snacks and drinks on board. The only thing that was a bit confusing is where to board - there were different lines or something. Some signs would be helpful, but it was not a big deal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qoom
50,Relaxing boat ride,Comfortable boat ride. We left out of Dana Point. Be advised that you first have to buy your parking pass by the blue umbrella and then move your vehicle to an adjacent lot; so give yourself enough time to park and make this walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilyMurrieta
30,Got Us There,"We took the Catalina Express to Catalina Island in February, 2015. The ride was fine and got us to Catalina Island on Schedule.We made a big mistake by going to Catalina Island on Superbowl Sunday. It seemed like 70% on the businesses and restaurants were closed. The place looked deserted.We grabbed a bite to eat at a restaurant whose name I don't recall.Based on our experience that day, I would not go back, as this place seemed like a big tourist bore trap, even if all of the restaurants and tourists shops were open.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robertsJ8565RW

50,"Quick, smooth trip!","The whole experience was great. We were supposed to be on the 8:30 boat out to the island and arrive a little before an hour prior to our departure. The lady checking us in told us that the 7:30 ferry hadn't left yet and asked if we wanted to be on it, of course we said yes. The ride was great, we rode through the port in Long Beach and on to the island. They served drinks and snacks and the staff was very friendly. I would definitely take the same ferry again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamieg337
50,B'day Boy,"Went out on my B'day on their free trip to Catalina Island. It is my 3rd trip to CI and always love it. Saw Dolphins, whales and a beautiful island. What a day and I love walking around the Island, or carting. And eating on the water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamC608

40,Very friendly staff!,"I used to ride the WA State Ferries daily between Seattle and Bainbridge Island. They are not known for being all that friendly.The Wa State crews are okay. The Captains and Mates are great!On this vessel, every crew member was friendly. I was impressed. We left on time and arrived on time. A little choppy on the way over but what can you do?Good operation!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/229RobertD
40,Dolphins at no extra charge.,"My family has been going to Catalina on the Express for over 20 years. Our first visit was on a cruise ship and then we took the ferry, but then we discovered the Express & its great. The ships are smallish, but big enough to be fairly stable. There is food on board to purchase. You often have your choice of inside or outside seating, and in about an hour, you'll watch as Catalina comes into sight and you navigate into the Yacht filled harbor. Along the way, on several occasions, we've sighted dolphins near our Express ship.Just kick back and wait foryour vacation place to come to you... comfortably and quickly.My family loves the trip, but of course the trip home isn't nearly as fun. Why is that??",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dansX5782WB

Thanks,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LizzieS936
50,Glad we decided to do this!,Nice spot. Lots of parking. You will have to pay for parking though. There is also a small cafe inside if you are hungry. The ferry ride was good. The boat well kept up and clean. The captain friendly and we got to see dolphins and whales!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelnmom31

50,A Fun Ride!,"I had such a great day heading to Catalina Island. It started off with the Catalina Express - I was able to book my trip through the hotel concierge and then headed off to the office of Catalina Express. I had many comfortable options to sit - also available is an upgrade to first class for an additional $15USD. The customer service staff was polite and cordial and very informative for a first time travel. Once aboard I sat outside to enjoy the views as we took off towards Catalina Island. While on board there were options for beverages (alcoholic and non), snacks and company should you wish to visit! If you sit inside in the comfort of Air conditioning - there are cushy seats airplane tables and it is very clean. - What a fun way to ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/260petrap
50,Great experience!,"My two friends and I took the Catalina Express on a Saturday morning (9am ferry) with 3 teenagers for a day trip (returning on the 645pm ferry). We were extremely happy with the experience. Finding our way to parking was easy. The lot was a little crowded and parking was only available towards the back of the lot but a shuttle was very quick to pick us up and take us to the main check in. Upon arriving we were able to check in very easily and quickly. We were also happy to find a cafe with wide assortment of breakfast foods, sandwiches, muffins, beverages, etc. All were very reasonably priced as well. The location was very easy to navigate and had plenty of outdoor seating to eat our breakfast while waiting for the ferry. The ferry departed on time and was very organized with boarding passengers. The ferry was roomy with various options for indoor seating as well as outdoor seating. There was food and beverages for purchase as well as several bathrooms on board. The trip was smooth on the day we sailed. We would definitely recommend the ferry (and a day trip to Catalina Island) to anyone looking for something fun to do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KikiK614

50,Great Weekend Getaway for Family!,I traveled with 6 family members including my elderly grandfather. The cruise was a great experience for all! Easily accessible and beautiful views included. The crew even helped to board my grandfather first without us asking. Great Experience! Looking forward to visiting again :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dev9687
50,Always a fun trip !,"Love coming to catalina/Avalon ! It really is a spectacular place to spend a night or w weekend ! If only for the night , take a early more boat and leave the next day in the late afternoon...it feels like a whole weekend ! Your hotels will usually have a discount for the expressThe shops are great and my opinion no more expensive than the malls on mainland. If your having s birthday, even the boat ride is free for you !Avalon has great history and the experience feels like your in a Caribbean so a little day or two here and you feel like you have been away for a week ! Lots of tours, great restaurants and just walking around makes for quite the entertainment here !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/905LisaF
40,Christmas on Catalina Island,It was our first time to Catalina Island. We were visiting Laguna Beach and had no plan to go to Catalina. But the folks at the Inn recommended that we go and what a great experience. The ship over to the island was fantastic. We went on the Admirals level which included a snack and adult beverages. What better way to start a great new adventure. The views from the top level are amazing. Catalina is simply a must do. The people there are so friendly and proud of their island - so refreshing!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rslot
50,Very enjoyable cruise,"Unfortunately, the day we booked the trip for turned out to be rainy in the morning and all we could see was gray sky and gray water until the windows fogged up and then we could see nothing! Still a nice 1-hr. cruise from Long Beach to Catalina Island. They were very quick to come around and see if we wanted a beverage. The return trip was much nicer -- the sun had come out, plus we were ""forced"" to sit upstairs in the Commodore Lounge because the main deck was sold out when we went to book tickets. Well worth the extra cost, we thought. It included a glass of wine or drink, and a small snack and we got excellent service. In fact, we found all the employees on and off the boat to be very pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bevb326
50,Beautiful Ride,"We live in Orange County so we took the boat/ship from Dana Point to Catalina, my partner got a free trip for his birthday but the price is reasonable, we would go again without the perk. The ship was bigger than I thought it would be, some are going to stay longer than just the day in Catalina like we did; we rented a golf cart and road all around the island; we had been on a bus tour and saw some things we might want to see up closer and stay awhile. It was great and the pics from the areas we went too were very good, great view. The shopping is better than most towns that size, the food was very good; We bought sweat shirts and snacks and had a beer and caught the ship back in the afternoon. It was smooth sailing all the way, both ways, you can sit inside or outside, there was nothing missing! The staff was great but not in your face, we just chatted and enjoyed the scenery and each other. It was a beautiful sunny day, typical for Catalina!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanieRich
50,Nice cruise between Long Beach & Catalina Island and return.,"Such a relaxing cruise from the coast to Catalina Island for a day of fun, excitement and adventure. There's so much to do in Catalina, we wished we could stay overnight, at least. Cocktails, wine & beer is available on board; our Bloody Marys were some of the best we've enjoyed! Safe, comfortable ride and the cost is feesible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DSpa0514
30,"Great For Birthdays, But Has Downfalls!","I was happy for the free ride my Mom received for her birthday. I was disappointed in how dirty the seats on the boat were, especially for $75 round trip! Also the employees on the island, that work for this company were very rude. The girls in the information booth were more into talking to each other than helping us. Also they had earlier departure times that weren't listed and we were all told that even though there were sets we would need to pay to leave early. This wouldn't have been an problem (staying on the island longer) if the majority of the shops hadn't closed early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/253patricen
40,A great birthday trip,"I took advantage of the ""ride free on your birthday"" promo. There was some confusion on whether or not the return trip had to also be on the birthday in order for it to be free. In my case, I'm happy to report, the return trip the following way was indeed free.There was plenty of seating available all over the ship. The trip was very timely. They were rather lax on giving the safety/ lifevest lecture. If you're at all nervous, I'd ask. The staff was very polite.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewinsomewench
50,"Nicely maintained fleet, easy parking and embarkation","We took the Catalina Express to the island and back and it was a quick, comfortable ride there and back. We paid $74.50 round trip per person and $12.00 per day to park at their terminal/berth. We sat on the top deck and enjoyed the views (lighthouse, seals playing in the wake of the boat as we headed out of port). The top deck gets chilly as the boat gets going so take a sweater and secure your belongings because the wind took a passengers baseball cap on the way out and a towel on the way back. The ferry lets you take suitcases, bikes, ice chests strollers and camping gear (with some restrictions) which comes in handy for longer trips. The terminal in San Pedro has a place to eat or get cocktails while you wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gabby92399

50,Great way to get to Catalina!,My boyfriend and I just visited the island for three days. We took my dog as well. Our boats were extremely fast and comparable and dog friendly. Of course we had to comply with the muzzle rule but all went well. There were six dogs on the boat on the way home. So nice to be able to travel with all of your family members.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VictoriaS768
50,Great ride to Catalina,The express is a great fast and affordable at to get to Catalina. I did a day trip there and back and enjoyed it. Boat is comfortable and drinks are available with cash.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jdharris717
50,Day Cruise,"For a small ticket price on Catalina Express, this has always been on of my favorites. Love the day cruise; enjoying the ocean, the quaint beaches at Catalina, the decent pubs and restaurants on the shoreline and have thoroughly enjoyed Hamilton Cove Villas. A short walk to Decanso beach, with quaint shops and a bar located right on the beach. Kayaking, SUP, scuba, snorkeling, zip line, are all available to the day cruiser.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJT852
10,Beware the Refund Run-around,"I agree with most reviews here. The express is a blast and is a great way to experience the decompression you want going from the craziness of LA to the escape Avalon has to offer.But!My experience with canceling my ticket opened up a whole new world on Catalina Express the COMPANY.Here's why. I checked in early in San Pedro Catalina Express port. I'd bought my tickets online a month in advance. Got the tickets. Round trip.So I'm killing time in the terminal, and I notice a desk for a helicopter to Catalina. I was escorting a Catalina Newbie on the trip and thought, ""what the heck, ask and see"". They were running a winter weekday special. $225 one way for two people. The net net with a refunded boat ride was worth the splurge!!! Helicopter out, boat ride back the next day - was the new plan.I asked if I could get a refund on the boat leg out to Avalon.Sure! No problem. 10.00 cancel charge. No big deal. They refund my boat ride out to Catalina and we had a great 14 minute trip to Catalina via helicopter. (splurge off-season, it's a deal!)It was so much fun, I decided to cancel my return boat ride the next day and take the helicopter back to San Pedro.I go to the Catalina Express office on the island but they refused to refund my boat ride.I was handed a form to fill out. Asking all sorts of personal info, reasons for canceling, blah blah blah. Which had to be MAILED to the corporate offices, who would decide whether or not I'd get a refund within two weeks of receipt of a postage-stamped envelope.They said the clerk who refunded my boat ticket shouldn't have done it. He was screwing up their system and was going to get in trouble.Really?My successful refund had already registered on their computer screen.I asked them to do what the San Pedro clerk did, and make it happen today. They refused.I called their customer service, and after much backing & forthing & double speak, they essentially said the same thing, I had to mail in a refund request, wait 2 weeks etc.I asked they email me a receipt, or text me a head's up when it was processed, etc.They wouldn't take my email or my phone number. In fact they assured me they would not call or email notifications, they wouldn't fax this form to their office either, they were so...1990.I could go on about tone, body language, and undertones which made it worse.I can't remember a more disappointing experience in travel. I travel a lot and I have a slow fuse. I'm very forgiving. But this was a huge hassle. So I posted this heads up. Don't try to cancel this ticket. It will leave a bad taste in your vacationing palette.Waiting for a charge back to come to my credit card, with no notification via email or text or call, sometime before March.Amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/422josephs
40,More than a ferry ride,"The Catalina Express is pricey but it is more than just a ride to Catalina. The pier location is new and clean and has a choice of eating establishments. The outdoor area is comfortable and scenic. The boat itself, has very comfortable seating on both levels. There is a snack bar if you desire a snack.The ride is smooth and there are screens to show you how far along you are in the trip. More than a ferry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24QueenBee
40,Great way to travel..,"There may be other ways to get to Catalina, but why?Take the Catalina Express. We took at from Long Beach to Catalina during a HORRIBLE storm (early evening on 12/30/14). Even the crew was rocking and wondering.......The return was 1/2/15 and was MUCH more enjoyable. We sat on the outside deck and enjoyed the fresh air (without the rain).....it was really simple and lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adobin
50,Bring your bike,"Its $7.00 each to bring it, and $10.00 or more to rent one. You'd rather have a bike here than not-if able to ride. City bike racks leave a lot to desire. We ranged from the Pebbly Beach to the Descanso Beach and points in between. Watch out for the renters of little golf carts on your bike-beware of cruise ship pedestrian wanderers stepping in front of you. Otherwise, ride on. Cruise ship accommodations for an hour ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bugnurse56
50,Easy as can be,"We just took the express from Long Beach to Catalina round trip and it was great! The parking is easy access to the dock and the staff is very friendly. There are various seating options so you can be indoors or out ... in the sun /wind or not. It is such a relaxing and beautiful trip, particularly after fighting all the LA traffic to get there. I appreciated the ride and it was rather smooth. There are eating and drinking options on the ferry but I was told you must have cash so plan ahead if you think you will need something ... the ride is only 60 minutes so you can probably avoid this. Also, there is a great café next to the dock (Fresh Food Café), that we ate lunch both coming and going to Catalina.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cincymom5
40,No issues!,"Got me from A to B, nice service, no issues!On the way there I sat outside where it was cold but the views were stunning. On the way back I sat inside and it was so nice and cosy I fell asleep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rowenav484
40,Still the best way to the Island,"I have been going to Catalina Island for over 25 years. Catalina Express is still the best way to get to the island and back. The boats are getting faster and more stable, No more sea sick kids and family's. The total trip is just over an hour and this is fast. Two harbors is my favorite spot on the island, Is is like a company town from the old west. One Bar, restaurant and Store. Loads of natural water actives to do. Why go to mexico when this is just a short drive and boat ride from LACatalina Express website needs to be updated and the phone reservation is OK.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515
50,"Easy booking, easy parking","Nobody likes confusing or complicated travel, so I was somewhat nervous when I bought the tickets because I hadn't been on a boat to Catalina since I was a child and I vaguely recall my parents stressed out and arguing. Well, that memory must have been about something unrelated to the boat. It was super easy to buy the tickets online, easy to find the parking lot, easy to check in and easy to board.If you want to sit up top, then get in line early and board first, but even with a full capacity trip, the wait and line to board isn't bad.Surfboards and bikes are only $3.50 extra each way.Parking is $12 per day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SeaJenniTravel
30,Fast and efficient transfer to the island,"The Catalina express was easy to book. We booked day of tickets (the day before the July fourth holiday) for a trip to the island. It was easy and reasonably priced -$74/per person roundtrip.Simply check the schedule online and head to the port. We parked in the lot at the long beach dock.I recommend visiting the island as a day trip as there's not much to do.The seats are comfy, just get in line right away to have your pick.IYou can get drinks from an on-board cash only bar.The trip is a quick 60 minutes. If you get motion sick, take something. It was sad to see all the people who were seasick.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pdh202
40,Go on your Birthday!,"Catalina Express ferry is a very pleasant efficient way to get to Catalina. We left from the San Pedro dock and were told to arrive more than 30 min early to pick up our tickets,etc. which we did, and we enjoyed a tasty breakfast and coffee from their little shop while we sat on a bench and waited to board. The San Pedro terminal seemed like a new building and nothing not to like. Straight forward check in. Comfortable seats on the ferry (we were inside, on the first deck) and large window views, a relaxing ride across the choppy waters on a boat that was more comfortable than the old-school ferries that I have ridden on. Walking around while moving was a bit rocky :).Our adult daughter happened to have a birthday the day we went, so she was Free...not a bad deal as the ride is a little pricey. However, I noticed that you do have to book the birthday ride in a advance of the day, as they had to email me a birthday reservation number in advance of us booking the trip...so plan a few days ahead! Birthday girls (and guys) also get some discounts at sites on Catalina, so remember to ask when you tour around!Ferry is timely and well run and a pleasant way to start and end the day (trip).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kn83
40,Long Beach to Avalon - smooth sailing but take Dramamine,"I highly recommend taking some motion sickness pills a few hours before taking the ferry if you're prone to motion sickness like me. Putting things in perspective, my 3 friends didn't feel sick at all. Take the pills both ways. (I did not take any hence was feeling sick. I just went to sleep.)We got the ferry originating from Long Beach. Ample parking ($15/day) and this building/port was easy to find. Close to a freeway exit. Note, we wanted to leave on a Saturday at around 10:00 am, but that trip was booked. So may I suggest that you make reservations early so that you have room at the time you want to take the ferry. We had the same problem going back. Reserve early!Boarding is relatively smooth and easy both ways.My friends reserved the trip using his credit card. We, however, were able to purchase Catalina Express gift cards (a few Costco stores carry them -$80 for $100 gift card). When it was time to pick up our tickets, we just paid using the gift cards. Thus, effectively getting some type of discount.The upgraded seats for this ferry (which you pay extra), from what I understand, may not be worth it. You just get better seats. But the standard seats are fine as they are.Note, it does get cold. So bring a sweater.If you want to take an earlier trip (assuming there's room), you need to pay $5 extra. Round trip ticket is approx $75.00 each. We booked directly via the website.There is a counter selling some drinks/snacks. Bathrooms available.Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrkkjones
50,Great ride,"The ride was fun, yet a little cold because we were on the outside of the ferry and it was windy. It didn't take but a little over an hour to get to Catalina Island. The fare was a little high, but we purchased a California Pass and saved some money. The view was spectacular as we approached the island. Also, as we were leaving, the sun was going down and it was beautiful. The view through Newport Beach was breath-taking. Would recommend this ferry anytime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhOtOqueen2014
40,Quicker than expected,Travel time goes by faster if you read or take a nap (like hubby). Great views and photo ops when leaving Long Beach and arriving in Catalina. The indoor seating on the top deck is more comfortable than expected. Bathrooms were decent.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lost175lbs
30,Nothing special - expensive,"It was a really expensive trip so I thought that the accommodations would be much nicer. I wouldn't bother getting the upgrade to the Commodore Lounge unless you want a cookie and a drink. They entice you into this upgrade by saying that you board before the other passengers but it's not like there are 500 people getting on the boat. Save your money and wait an extra few minutes to board the boat. Also, they talk about how fabulous the seats are in the Commodore Lounge and I really didn't notice any difference.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SingletonFamily
50,Wonderful Means of Transportation!!,"I did a spontaneous solo trip to Catalina for a zip lining excursion, and booked my tickets online for the Catalina shuttle. The regular seating was roomy, comfy, and plenty of windows for viewing the open sea!! I couldn't believe how quick the ride was between Long Beach & Catalina!! I highly recommend visiting Catalina and using the Catalina Express!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LNRobin
50,Perfect from start to finish,"I took a solo trip to Catalina Island departing from San Pedro to Avalon on a slow Monday in September. Booking online I was unable to find a return trip the same day, but found excellent assistance and a confirmed seat with a phone reservationist. It was advised to get to the terminal an hour prior to departure, which I did. The newly built attractive terminal building was open and a small food kiosk was serving early arrivals. The bathrooms were spotless and there were plenty of seating options available outside overlooking the port. The ticket agents were courteous and the check-in line moved smoothly; boarding was on time. I took some nice photos from the stern of the boat as we headed out of the port. Unsure of how cool it would be for an outdoor seat, I opted for an inside booth close to the bow of the boat. There were a decent number of empty seats open. After out to sea for a bit, the swells were pretty high and felt more strongly where I was positioned. I moved to a seat off the back of the boat in the open air to avoid any chance of seasickness. There was food, drink and alcohol available. The bathrooms were very clean and quite roomy for a boat. The vessel appeared to be well maintained and clean with courteous staff on board. On the return trip, which I had heard was smoother; the seating area off the back of the boat caught a lot of spray that was not felt on the crossing over to Avalon. I would highly recommend this company as everything was perfect from start to finish.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kribbean
50,The Best... Forget the Rest,"We took the Catalina Express from Long Beach, CA to Avalon, Catalina Island. It is just about one hour to Avalon. We highly recommend the Long Beach Service and to upgrade to Commodore Lounge. It is located on the upper deck and offers passengers pre boarding and a complimentary beverage of your choice serve by cabin attendants which demonstrate all safety emergency features, which it is not demonstrated on the rest general areas!! The Commodore lounge has reclining seats, tray tables. Very roomy. We recommend you don't pay attention to on line schedules or printed brochures, as we first handed discover just by accident that a trip was available but did not appear at the time leaving Long Beach at 11:00 am and then returning 7:30 pm. The Commodore upgrade is just $15.00 extras very worthy! We had a great time talking to Steve, who was very informative and helpful. Great demeanor, professional, and charming! The Catalina Express also has a Captain Lounge Special Seatings Options. If you are over 55 years old, guess what you get a serious discount from $72.50 to $66.00 dollars without the upgrade to Commodore Lounge. They offer group rates and Charters. One VERY IMPORTANT INFO is that the Ship inside ONLY TAKES CASH FOR SNACKS AND BEVERAGES in the general areas. We were not informed anywhere by this news so in our way to Avalon, Catalina Island we where not able to purchase any food or drinks, that was the biggest NO NO to this experience! They have a bag limit 50lbs. Per bag; Two bags. Must show 20 minutes prior to departure. If you change your departure time there is a fee of $5.00 per ticket, one way! But no charge to any reservation prior to a ticket issued. We had a blast, we will definitely return to Avalon. We will must again experience the greatest hospitality of Steve and the crew of the Catalina Express from Long Beach. Our daughter and we were so exited to see the dolphins swimming by the boat, and Steve told us that last week a whale was spotted next to the ship. Amazing experience, they are very much Pet Friendly and we love that. The hospitality, ambiance, experience we highly recommend to everyone of all ages. By the way very romantic as well. We will see you all soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJ778
50,Smooth Trip,Family of 4 took the 9:30 departure from San Pedro to Avalon. Departed on time. Arrived on time. Saw whales on the way. Seats were comfortable. Seemed a bit pricey?? But few alternatives. I would use Catalina Express again. Make sure you make a reservation!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barkwood66
40,Enjoy the Fresh Air Ride,"The Catalina Express is a great boat for all Catalina trips. You can take bikes, as much outdoor gear as you can carry and enjoy a fast ride. We have sat in the Commodore Lounge and in general seating. Both are fine. The Commodore comes with a bit more privacy and free drinks and snacks. Not bad for a small upcharge. If someone in your party is prone to motion sickness opt for the open air seating as the fresh air helps with the ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zkrscasa
50,"Great day, so glad we decided to make the trip.","Living in the Midwest, we had often commented that we should go to Catalina sometime when we were in CA for business or pleasure. Our daughter lives in SoCal, so we finally decided on a Friday afternoon to leave on Saturday. I booked the trip on the phone and found out that our preferred port to leave (Long Beach) was already full for a mid morning departure, so we settled on the San Pedro launch port. Easy to find using nav and posted signs, we were pleasantly surprised with the indoor facilities that include a small food concession and bar, with brochures on various activities on the Island.We sat outside on the top deck and for 70 minutes loved the ride to Catalina. The weather and water were perfect, but if you do sit outside, bring a jacket for the wind and a hat or sunscreen. On the way over, we read about some of the activities in the brochure and decided to rent a golf cart when we landed. Absolutely the best idea of the day; the island is very hilly with cliffs and amazing views, but you need a way to get up the hills and we highly recommend the gas engine golf carts for rent at 3 or more booths. The carts are covered and can hold 4 or 6 people, and if you sign up before 1pm, there was a discount of 'buy 2 hrs, get the 3rd hr free'. At $40/hr, 3 hrs for $80 was a great way to zip around the suggested route (w/map) and stop to take pictures, grab a taco and beer near the golf course and hit the beach area bar near the tail end of our 3 hrs.Everyone on the boat was friendly and professional and someday I'd love to take Catalina Express over to the island for another day of fun. Small shops and restaurants are all walking distance from the landing site, along with water toys to rent, if you don't feel like a ride up through the hills with the beautiful views. There are also small lockers for rent near the landing dock, in case you need storage space for your belongings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsStapes
50,"Catalina, CA.","An enjoyable hour long ferry to Catalina. As you get near it reminds you of Skull Island in King Kong. Anything but. Five of us went on the Avalon Scenic Drive through Catalina Expeditions. Wonderful tour. Learned a lot and we all enjoyed Cindy Lowe, our driver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NycElm
50,FANTASTIC BIRTHDAY EVENT,"Kudos to Catalina Express for their free trip to Catalina on your birthday promotion. They have upgraded and reorganized since I participated several years ago and it is a class act. Starting with check-in, they really make your day special. They now have a Happy Birthday ribbon, which lets everyone know it's your birthday, and they also have a abrochure full of discounts and freebies. Everywhere I went, people said happy birthday. Thanks to Lloyd's for the free birthday ice cream cone! I only wish I'd planned to stay overnight to take advantage of Afishinado's flying fish tour! A lovely day, and a wonderful time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladysailor715
50,Great Ride!,Great Service. The trip to and from Cataline was very smooth and peaceful. The boats were very clean. We enjoyed our day there. One more place checked off our bucket list. The directions to get to Berth 95 was spot on. We will use this service again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clalves
50,Bucket List check off trip. Spectacular,"Fabulous, peaceful, journey to one of the premier day trips in America. Catalina Island is breathtaking. Short but nature embracing voyage. Went from Newport Beach. Took my mom and sister and cousin for a refreshing, relaxing life goal trip. Look for groupon deals on weekdays.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robmcliberty
50,Employees need proper customer service training,"I've been traveling on the express my whole life, and it has been overall an enjoyable experience. They keep ( for the most part) their boats clean, staff is friendly on the boat , and it's always a pretty crossing. The only problem is the ticket agents at the express in avalon could be.... A little nicer. One woman, I believe she works in the morning , that's when I usually see her , she always has an attitude. I don't know her name, nor would I say it in this review but she has reddish hair, and wears glasses. Ever experience I've had with her, she's always been uptight. I understand it can be difficult dealing with customers everyday, (I, as well, have a job where you're constantly interacting with people) but that's what we get paid to do. She can at least say thank you or smile. That's just my input, but overall the express has been a great way to travel over to, and from the island.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/recklessm
50,Clean and efficient,"We used Catalina Express from Dana Point to Avalon and then Avalon to Long Beach. Both boats were super clean and very efficient. The crew was helpful and friendly, they have had a good lesson on customer service! The Bloody Mary on the Dana Point to Avalon was excellent!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnhsrq
50,Take The Glass Bottom Boat.,"If you or your group co to Catalina, the best way is on the Glass Bottom Boat, so you can see the Sea Life as you take the trip to the Island.The Island is pricy for Hotels, so check in advance, also checkto see when the Glass bottom runs its the Best.Great place to spend the day, and a lot of Nature to see,and Buffalo Here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RitchieH_12
50,Nice trip to Catalina Island,"The Catalina Express ferry service to Catalina Island was easy to access and provided great service from professional staff. The website is user friendly and made booking a snap. We departed from the San Pedro dock for Avalon at 9:00 a.m. on a Monday morning and returned from Avalon at 5:15 p.m. It takes about an hour each way and you can sit inside or out. It being March, we chose to sit inside, but there are lots of big windows and the view is great from every seat. Everything, including the washrooms, was clean and neat. There is a limited selection of snacks and drinks, but you could bring your own. We recommend making an advance online reservation to guarantee your space, especially in the busy tourist season. We would definitely recommend this service and will use it again ourselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alectric9
50,Quick one day trip,"The ride over on Catalina Express was quite enjoyable. It was cold the day we went but you are able to sit inside so we did not have a problem. We took two tours. Our first was a submarine boat that had viewing windows to see the fish. I wish I could remember the girls name who told us about all of the things we saw. She was great and very knowledgeable. Our second tour was on a bus with Charles as our driver. He took us all over the island. It was so interesting to be able to see how everyone lives there. Charles was well informed about every question we had for him. He was also quite the comedian. I am usually afraid of heights but with Charles I felt very comfortable. I had such a great time, everyone was so nice and I plan on going again soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GMQualityInn
50,Day Trip Via Catalina Express,"Calalina Express offers a free birthday round-trip excursion to Catalina Island. I recommend taking advantage of this if the opportunity arises. I made a birthday day trip and had a great day on the island. Discount coupons are always available for regular fares.Each crossing takes about 1 hour. Bring snacks, your music or a book for the ride over. It can be a chilly ride over water due to the wind. You can enjoy the interior or outside deck of the boat for the overwater ride.Staff members are very friendly.There are various departure times available and the boats are dilligent wtih keeping to their time tables. The boats are comfortable and reliable.Great views out of Long Beach and Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rome949
50,What a great journey!,"We took the Catalina Express from Long Beach to Avalon on Sunday at 2, returning Monday at 11:45 after a lovely afternoon, evening, and morning on the Island. Both trips were magnificent! We sat on the very top level and enjoyed the breezes and sunshine. We had bundled up, so cold was not an issue. Transfers were very smooth, leaving and arriving on time. Parking at LB and luggage handling were effortless. Staff were great, and things were not crowded. We saw porpoises and seals ... And loved snuggling on the journey. Thank you for a wonderful trip ... Times two!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranlauren
50,Commodore's Lounge!,"You cannot go wrong paying the extra $15 to be allowed to board first, have a drink and sit back in comfort while the express takes you on a wonderful, restful journey! One cannot express how wonderful each of the staff members are! The ship's crew greets you as you board, they greet you as you come into your seating area, they greet you when they serve you, and the process goes in reverse when you disembark! I had a wonderful trip both ways and have not lost sleep over the cost one bit! I was nervous being on a ship in the ocean, but my fears were for nothing. The Captain and crew got us to and from without any rough movements. I am thoroughly impressed and cannot wait for my next trip! <3 Hugs and Kisses to the crew!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolB612
40,Free Ferry to Catalina Island on your birthday!,"Tour is expensive ($34 each way from Dana Point dock), but it is a day trip you should definitely take. And if it happens to be your birthday, your trip is free! I think that deal only lasts for 2013.The ferry is clean and well operated, but if the water is rough, sit in the back. You need to be in line early if you want to get a seat by the window, as they obviously fill up very fast. The tickets should be reserved online or by phone in advance (as much as 4 days). They have very STRICT cancellation policies so be certain your dates are firm. The loading area is clean and pleasant, with a great coffee shop in the plaza. The staff on the ferry was very friendly and informative. The staff doing the ticket sales were UNFRIENDLY and rather surly...like they were really sick of tourists...and it was only 8:30 a.m.! We left at 9:50 a.m. and caught the last ferry back at 4:30 p.m. and that was enough time to really walk the town, have lunch and take a tour of the island. It was a very pleasant day and I do highly recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katdod50
50,Great ride from Dana Point to Catalina,"We thoroughly enjoyed our ferry ride to Catalina on 2/15. The views are beautiful, we loved watching San Diego fade into the background as we made the 22 mile journey to Catalina. A piece of advice- dress warm if you want to sit outside!! It is very windy on the outside deck and we got very cold even though it was over 70 degrees. Bring a sweatshirt (with a hood!)On the way to Catalina our captain spotted a ""super pod"" of dolphins. There were hundreds of them!! He made an announcement and circled among the dolphins for an extra fifteen minutes. It was amazing and very appreciated!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tripgrl727272
50,Trip to Catalina Island on the Catalina Express,"This was one of the smoothest sea trips I have ever taken. The whole experience was fantastic. I would highly recommend using Catalina Express for anyone wishing to visit Catalina Island.The boats were clean and well operated.I would have liked to spend more time on the island, but family commitments did not allow me to. Loved the whole island. It's unique, interesting and a true experience. Definitely worth another visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RevaB
50,Captain's Lounge - totally worth it!,"We took the Catalina Express to and from Dana Point/Avalon recently and we were impressed. The crew was friendly and the boat was on time/early. We splurged and purchased the Captain's Lounge upgrade for 3 of us. It has room for eight, so we had plenty of space for all of our carry-on luggage and to move around easily. There is a bathroom right outside the lounge - very convenient. There was a TV with cable channels and we got four free drinks with the lounge. On the trip out to Avalon, we didn't realize we had pre-boarding privelges with our Captain's Lounge, but on the way back from Avalon, we took advantage of that and enjoyed quick and easy boarding without having to stand in line. It was well worth the upgrade and we had a great trip!By the way, when I called to make our reservations (and ask questions), I was informed by the very nice customer service lady that for every $100 in gift cards, I bought, I would receive $15 off of the upgrade. So that saved us $45 bucks and everything went very smoothly with the gift cards (they were mailed to me in plenty of time before our trip). Parking was only $12/day and it was only a few blocks away. We had a great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianaB262
50,Catalina Island made easy,"Arrive early at the Long Beach terminal and get a senior ticket if you qualify. Easy ride on thePacific Ocean. Might see dolfins or whales in early morning. You can stay on the island the whole day, returning late evening. Easy to book day trips once you get off the ferry right at the pier. Take the day trip to the airport via a 1953 bus from Ohio. A real trip of a time. The scenery is great as you take in the buffalo herd near the airport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564barbaraw564
40,Best way to visit catalina island,We took this ferry from Balboa terminal. Its approximately 75 mins to reach the island from Balboa. We stayed at Holiday Inn Express in Newport Beach. It was just a ten minute drive. The rousnd trip ferry fare is around $65++/person. The ride is relaxing. The island is beautiful. You have to rent a golf cart to explore its beauty. It took as at least an hour and a half to drive around the island. It reminded me of Capri or Monte Carlo. ...Just on a smaller scale. Friendly people and perfect day trip for a romantic day. The ferry leaves at 9 am and returns at 430pm.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ellygan
40,Good Transportation,"Nothing exceptional here , but good quality transportation with smacks and drinks if you like. Crew friendly and knowledgeable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dwbfl0515
50,Catalina Express is the only way to go!,"We recently travelled from Long Beach to Catalina Island (Avalon) and back on the Catalina Express ferry (passengers only; no cars). It was a very positive experience!I made our reservations online before travelling to California. Senior fares begin at age 55. Access to the Long Beach terminal was a little hard to locate by car, but we figured it out without great difficulty. There is secure covered parking for vehicles ($15 per 24-hr. period), which we took advantage of, as we were going to the Island for a couple of days.The ferries are modern and clean, with a separate area at one end of the ferry for passenger luggage. The upholstered seats are plentiful and comfortable, with tables to put your food or drink (or laptop) on. Both times, the ferry left and arrived on time. The trip each way is about one hour. There is a snack bar onboard, which serves excellent Bloody Mary's!The terminal at Long Beach is large and clean, with numerous amenities such as washrooms, tourist desk and efficient staff processing passengers. They offer free fare for those celebrating a birthday - which my husband missed by only one day! Wouldn't it be great if they'd offer a free fare for those with a birthday the same week!?All in all, the Catalina Express ferry is an excellent choice for getting to Catalina Island!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvs2nap
30,Don't waste your money on the Captain's Lounge,"We were told to be at Dana Point one hour prior to our 7:45 am departure to pick up our reserved tickets. We got there earlier than that which is good because it was difficult to find the store that houses the ticket counter. Granted, it was dark and we are from out of town so that may have made it more difficult than usual.We had to park, wait for the Catalina Express window to open, go buy the parking ticket for the day and then move our vehicle to another lot.We paid the extra $80 for the Captain's Lounge because our friend wanted to experience it. It was not worth $20 extra per person! The ""free drink"" was in a small plastic glass and the glass wasn't even full!Luckily the Lounge was booked by another party for the return trip because the regular seats were perfectly fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Barb045919
50,Excellent and easy to use,"I made our reservations on line before we left home for California and had no trouble finding and using the Catalina Express. You can pay extra money to sit in a special room, but the ""regular"" was just fine. Seats were big and comfortable and there were restrooms on the ferry and at the ferry dock (at both ends). The dock provides a clean, safe place to wait for the ferry. If you don't get tickets ahead of time, you'll likely not be able to go, as they do sell out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh315
40,Fun trip,"Fast trip to Catalina Island, about an hour's journey.... choose outdoor seating or inside seating.... either way is good. Outside will give you some good sun and sea spray! Long lines to board, get there early to get best boat seating. About $75 will take you to Catalina Island and back roundtrip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chickenbiscuit
50,Best Day Trip Via Catalina Express,"I'm from southern Florida and take the Key West Express to Key West several times a year. On my recent trip to L.A. with family, we decided to take the Catalina Express to Catalina Island and it was an excellent decision.Not only is the Catalina Express a joy to ride (stay in the cool air conditioned main cabin or outdoors on several upper decks to revel in the ocean breeze), it also offers a fantastic bar so you can relax and enjoy the trip without having to choose a DD (designated driver) in your group (unless you rent a golf cart when you arrive on the island).It's only an hour ride from Long Beach to Catalina Island and the ferry itself is (I have to say this) much nicer than the ferry we ride to Key West. This Catalina Catamaran really gives you a fast, smooth ride, even in windy, rainy weather!We'd do this again in a heartbeat. Don't miss this boat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VickisTrips
50,Always a Joy,"Traveled to Two Harbors from San Pedro.Very easy check-inWonderful trip acrossTrip back was via Avalon, made for a very nice boat ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BradleyS552
50,If you go to LA you need to make a trip to Catalina,"When making plans for a LA trip I found you can get a free ride to Catalina Island on your birthday. You must make reservations ahead of time and produce ID to show your birthday. Be sure and bring your print out confirmation code. This was the highlite of our California trip, we love it! We rented a gold cart and drove around, then took a underwater tour in a submarine. The island is great for families or couples. I wish I had made plans to stay over night on the island (we will next time).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Melena506
40,airplane style seating.....but arms dont go up,"Havent used Catalina Express to go to Catalina in quite awhile. Easy reservations. Only negative is they have airplane style seats. If you are larger in stature, the arms do not go up, so you need to make sure you can fit in those style seats. The one boat we went on, did have one small circular couch in the front, port side (left).Expect to stand in line for awhile to board, but line goes fast once they start boarding. Would recommend to book early, especially on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnG229
40,Get in line early to get good seats,"Good seats are by the window or in front of the TV. If you sit in the back, every time door opens, it's super loud and it may wake you up. If you get stuck in the middle you;ll end up sitting with strangers or people wouldnt stop chatting next to you and keep you up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sweeetkiwikisses
40,Easy No-fuss ride to Catalina,"They have a birthday special where you ride for free as long as it's started on the day of your birthday! You must book it on-line in advance (I think) and have a picture ID & your coupon on your day of transit. The fares are about $70 round trip otherwise, so it's a nice bargain.We left from San Pedro and they have a beautiful brand new terminal there. You board about 15 minutes in advance & the boat leaves ON TIME so don't be late! The ride was pretty smooth-there are restrooms and a snack/drink bar available so it was a pleasant experience. It was smooth sailing for us, although I hear it can get choppy.There is table seating as well as individual seats and you may see some dolphins along the way. Transit is about an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaiolohiakids
50,fun way to get an overview of Catalina Island,"I was recently in Long Beach, Ca. for dragon boat races. We went a day early to see Catalina Island. My friend booked us on the Catalina Express--a beautiful catamaran, which whisks you over to the island in about 45 min.!!One of the locals suggested we take the ""one hour scenic drive"" after we reached the island.What a hoot! The driver of the open air tour bus gave some great history and background as we meandered up and down the narrow island roads.We had a great lunch in on of the MANY cute waterfront cafes. Our total travel time from Long Beach and back was only about 6 hours!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rebeccah687
40,Catalina Island,"My first time to catalina it was awesome! the ride over was really nice and smooth the crew was polite and helpful, need to return to finish exploring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUSANASUE
40,Scenic Ride,"The boat ride to Catalina Island although pricey was smooth and quick. If you are fortunate enough to sit on the upper deck (seats go quickly) the view is amazing and makes the ride that much more enjoyable. We saw a number of dolphins and sea lions. The boats are clean, spaciuos and the crew is very friendly. There are a number of boat times to choose from making arrival to and departure from the island convient. Our hotel even paid for a taxi to pick us up and take us to the dock. The only bad part about the boat ride home was seeing Catalina fade away off in the distance. Cannot wait to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/781KarenB
40,"Quick, easy, and convenient","The ride to catalina island was very smooth, quick, and scenic. I would reccommend this ferry to anyone, old/young/groups/etc. It was clean, comfortable, timely and the staff was friendly and helpful. We called a day in advance and they had availability which was nice. It was also easy to get to and there was a lot of parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MalibuNY
40,"Short, convenient ride","This was easy and quick to get to the island. We bought our tickets online, which made things easier. No seasickness. Straight smooth ride. No bumpiness. Dogs are allowed on the boat, you just have to read the guidelines. Also check the hotel if their is a weight limit on dogs allowed on the property. They have snacks and drinks on board.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trixie8965
40,One of the only ways to get to Catalina but know the ins and outs,"I used the San Pedro berth 95 for Catalina Express. Some important things people should consider and some surprises.1. Book online BEFORE you arrive if you are sure of the departure time. Because trips are often sold out in advance and you might find yourself waiting hours for the next boat. Also take note of which ship you'll be boarding as they have different ones, some smoother than others (bigger).2. The ride can get choppy and should be have problems with motion sickness you may get sick. Take some store bought motion sickness pills and do yourself a favor. We saw people getting sick during the trip.3. Be prepared to pay $12 for the day parking fees and $1 per hour after that. The port is located a way from the city streets so finding other parking may be a problem.4. Wifi is FREE at the Berth 95 Catalina Express port, nice to have when you're told you have to wait 2 hours till the next open boat.5. The boats have working AC outlets, which make it possible to charge your camera, phone, computer or tablet during the trip.6. Snacks and drinks are sold, a bit expensive and small but expected.7. Be prepared to wait in lines, a line to get on, a line to get off, a line to buy tickets and sometimes a line to get food and drinks.8. You won't see much during the ride, no more flying fish, no whales or dolphins along the way. Years back I recall lots of flying fish, nothing but oil tankers and freighters from China.9. Use your AAA card for $7.50 off but note you need to go to the AAA website to print out the coupon which is needed WITH your AAA card for the discount.10. Last boat back was 9pm, we did two tours, an underwater fish seeing tour and a scenic drive along the inside of the island. ALL expensive $40 and up, beware of the hidden fees and taxes some tour operators don't tell you about that can add to your total. I think Catalina Excursions was the best deal for both the scenic drive and glass bottom boat tours $12 each compared to $40 each to others. Believe me they DON'T differ that much.11. We went 11am - 9pm and had more than enough time, could have done it in a few less hours, the rest of the time you're standing around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/derkdiggler
40,Fun trip to Catalina Island,We had a nice trip to the Island and back. We made the mistake of ordering the tickets on line and there was confusion in trying to make the change.

40,Nice Ride!,"We kind of booked last minute-ish so the only thing left for the time we wanted to go was the 15$ extra seats. The Commodore Lounge, I'm not sure it was worth the 15$ but since we didn't have a choice, I drank my ""free"" mimosa with no complaints! The boat is big and feels pretty stable. I get a little queasy on boats, so the ride out to Catalina I popped a dramamine. I needed it. It felt like the boat was pitching around a lot. I took the dramamine again for the return trip, but I wouldn't have had to, the ride was super smooth! The Staff on the boat were all very nice. There was a passenger yapping really loud about politics and the ""state of things"", one of the lounge attendents asked him politely to pipe down! Catalina Express is one of the few practical ways to get to Catalina, so for seemingly having the corner on the market they still treat people nicely!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYNY1

50,Going to Catalina,We booked on line (senior price if you are 55 or older) but later I saw you can even get a better deal if you buy a voucher at Costco. On the way over from Long Beach we sat outside because I was afraid I would be getting seasick. It was a little cold but I felt great the whole ride and we had a beautiful view. On the way back I sat in a very comfortable chair inside and slept for the 'little over an hour' ride. Again no sickness whatsoever! Did not use the available snack bar or bathrooms. Handling of luggage was easy and professional.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danidy
50,22 Miles Across the Sea,"No one really knows why the song was written using ""26 miles"" but the truth is, the Island is only 22 miles from the mainland and the very best way to get there is on the Catalina Express. The 75 minute ride gives you time to make the transition from ""real life"" to island-time. Getting the Commodore Lounge tickets is well worth the expense: you are on the top deck, have priority boarding, and are served a drink (champagne or bloody Mary, anyone?) at your seat. Every member of the crew welcomes you and offers assistance to those who require it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJean1565
50,Great smooth ride to Avalon,"My husband thought he would be sea sick, but the ride was so smooth, the people very professional and we did not use the Dramamine we bought. Great company.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnetteR709
50,Best way to get there,The best way to get to Catalina Island is via this ferry. The Commodore Lounge tickets were sold out by the time we arrived but the standard seating was fine for this hour-long ride. There was a snack bar though we didn't use it. Crew seemed friendly and knowledgeable.Register online beforehand and get a free ferry ride on your birthday!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cards-Preds-Fan

40,26 miles,Fast and smooth ride to Catalina from Long Beach. Had a little trouble with the wind and our departure was delayed a day but once we got on the boat it was fine!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bikemom63
50,Great ride,"Paid $15 upgrade to Commodore Lounge, but still needed to hurry on for window seating. It was too cold to ride outside, but if the weather is warm, skip the upgrade and sit on top...right hand side of the boat is best when departing before noon and returning in afternoon - best view and if you are indoors, less sunlight beaming in. We don't drink alcohol, so the upgrade fee really didn't get us much - soda and a cookie (great cookie), but if you drink, you do get one alcoholic drink free so that's a $7 value. Also get to load first, but that's not a huge deal either way. Would definitely recommend using Catalina Express and, if you drink and if it's too cold to ride outside, choose the upgrade, but hurry on and sit on the right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1KarenR
50,The only way to get to Avalon(almost)!,We went to Catalina in December for our anniversary. Our ride on the Catalina Express departed from Long Beach. We parked directly across in the parking garage. Once on the boat they serve drinks and snacks for good prices. It was cold but we went outside as we approached the island which was a good choice. On the way back we took the latest boat and spent most of the ride out under the stars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tallsocal
40,Free ride on your birthday,"The birthday boy/girl gets quite a bit of freebies, a free round-trip ticket on the Catalina Express is one of them (which is a $72.50 value). My small dog also came along for free. However, the dog must be muzzled or locked up in a bag.The seats are comfortable. Had no problem with customer service. Ride was not too choppy. It look approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Dana Point to Catalina. There is a $12 parking fee if you park your car in Dana Point Harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWithRiley
50,Nice ride,"The customer service @ the LB doc needs improvement. The ride is nice and it's a good time to take a nap if the water isn't too choppy. We've done the commodore lounge & general seating. Commodore is not worth the extra $. You still wait in line ,sometimes long, depending on when your departure time is. All it is is a ""free"" drink and a cookie with less people. We took the 3:45pm boat back to LB & arrived @ the landing 15 min b4 take off. We had general seating & stood way in the back of the line but there where still PLENTY of seats to choose from once we got on. We chose 3d row window seats in the front so we could also watch the football game on TV. The seats have ample space & they're further apart than on an airplane, so you don't feel like your crowded or cramped. It's the same thing in commodore, it's nothing special up there, so save that $ for a nice dinner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chaparrin9
40,The only way to go if you cant take a helicopter,This boat gets your to Catalina in about an hour. The ride is smooth and comfortable.

No problem getting down to the Long Beach terminal, parking, picking up our tickets at the will call window and lining up to get on the both.It was a comfortable one hour ride and they have a little snack bar if you get hungry. Always a smooth operation every time we've taken the Express.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pcman63
30,"Easy ride, but customer service could have been better","We took the Catalina Express in mid-June to the Island. I had paid the extra $15 to upgrade us to the Commodore lounge - the extra $30 allowed us to board first with no wait, comfortable seats, and a free drink each with a cookie. The boat ride was about an hour and fifteen minutes, nice and smooth the whole way.The only reason they didn't get 4 stars - some time between me booking the tickets online, and us actually showing up, the location of the port changed. If we were in our own car, no big deal. However, we were dropped off by a driver, and had no way to get to the other location. The staff just handed us a slip of paper with the new location. When we told them our towncar had already dropped us off, they told us to walk a long way to a main road and flag a taxi :-/ Luckily, a good Samaritan who was dropping off his wife and son offered to give us a lift to the other location. A little more customer service would have bumped them up to 4 stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amy-fishie
20,Not happy with customer service,"I booked my trip and was talked into signing up for activities on the island, with the understanding that I can cancel later if I decided I did not want to do it. When I called to cancell 2 days before the event, they refused to cancel, and I was stuck paying for activities I did not want to participate in. Don't fall for their ""sign up now and cancel later"" concept. They oversold me an activity I did not know anything about, and when I checked it out on Tripadvisor and decided I did not want to go, I was stuck with it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HanyFromHermosa
40,A good ride,"This ferry gets you to catalina island and I departed the downtown Long Beach landing to the Avalon landing.Overall the journey was pleasant and a smooth ride (although this will be dependent on the water!). The ferry itself is nicely done with plenty of seating, a bar with snacks all for good prices and a level where you can take in the views from outside.As its the only cost effective method of transportation onto the island they're doing a very good job!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deansmith333
50,Happy!,"We chose to take this boat to Catalina Island from Dana Point and were very happy with the experience. Would recommend you get in line much before the recommended time if you want a chance at sitting on the 2nd level inside-deck. But the main level deck is lovely as long as you can get a window seat to maximize the view. Boat was clean, the seats were comfortable, it had a nice snack bar with various drinks (cash only!) , the staff all wore crisp white shirts with little aviation/boating lapels on the shoulders- great operation. Luggage can easily be dropped off for under-boat storage as you board. On our way to Avalon, the captain even slowed the boat for a moment to show us what looks like a whale. A bit more expensive than I would have liked, but worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KasuKasu
50,The way to go to/from Catalina Island,"After attempting to take transport from Marina Del Rey and the company canceling our return trip (and no refund!), we went back to trusty Catalina Express. They have a bigger fleet and they're a lot more dependable. The people are always friendly and the seats are comfortable. We brought our small dog along with no problems (make sure you know the rules). This was our second go-round with them and we liked both experiences. Definitely, this is the way to travel to Avalon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toonvox
50,Catalina Express - Wow!,"We visit Avalon every Summer for the past 8 years and last Summer we decided to include the Banning House in Two Harbors. Travel to Two Harbors and then to Avalon seemed a bit of a chore. We normally use the Catalina Express Downtown Long Beach terminal, but only the San Pedro/Catalina service included Two Harbors. The problem was getting from Two Harbors to Avalon on the 2 leg of our visit. The only published method was a 2 hour bus ride (old school bus, no A/C and dusty roads). However, the San Pedro to Avalon boat included a stop at Two Harbors. We contacted Catalina Express for tickets and were told that was not possible. Upon speaking with the manager, he was very helpful and arranged tickets for us to travel on the boat (20 minute ride) from Two Harbors to Avalon. Kudos to Catalina Express and working with customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCal-CDS
