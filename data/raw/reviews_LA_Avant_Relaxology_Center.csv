50,"â€œExcellent and still the best 5 Star in all the surrounding area""","Squeaky clean!!!AWESOME price points for the time and quality behind every massage.Its a big place versus small tiny boxes filled with cigarette smoke and noisy cell phones not to mention constant chatter everywhere. NOT HERE!CLEANLINESS IS TOP PRIORITY AT THIS BUSINESS!!! Can't find clean and spacious for this price anywhere not to mention the quality is worth the money. NO bright lights, really dim & relaxing. Great for big parties as they have private rooms.I highly recommend Katie the owner, if you are looking for a male masseuse give Frank a try he will pull your knots out like a magician. This guy is worth your time & money! Be ready to withstand his strength, knots need a little manipulating & Frank definitely has what it takes.Bottom line:Very clean, detail orientated spa that provides the relaxation needed to allow the body to enjoy and benefit from their great techniques.",billionsandnocure
