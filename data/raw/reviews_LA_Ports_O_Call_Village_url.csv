10,They Closed it and That is a Good thing.,"It is now closed. Sad, because it was such a fun place when I was a kid. But it turned into such a dump and my last visit there showed it to be mostly torn down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

10,No longer there,"It was a great place to visit up until the 2000's. Then old age and a change in people's taste led to the downfall of this once lovely place.

30,Attraction of the future?,"The Ports O'Call Village is a waterfront dining area, of the Food Court type. It is mostly sea food, and popular with the locals. There are also boat trips ""around the harbour"" that leave from the Village.Not sure if it is fortunate or unfortunate - there is a multi million $ development in process, of completely knocking down and rebuilding the large waterfront area. It is rather run down, and there is apparently a lot of unrest with the current traders not all being offered places when the new complex is complete - some are, some are not. Must say we felt completely safe whilst walking around and the restaurants all seem to do well for customers.We heard it will be the latest ""In Place"" but do not completely agree - there is no beach and the view across the river is of hundreds and hundreds of cranes in the commercial shipyards - not very picturesque to watch over dinner!It seems a shame to completely rebuild rather than renovate, but then as we are not local we cannot know the reasoning behind local planning developments and we only hope that it works out well for all, if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Annechad
10,So Disappointing,"A friend was visiting from Utah and remembered visiting Ports O’ Call 30 years ago, loved it and wanted to revisit. After reading other reviews I was skeptical and tried to persuade her with other options. It would be a two hour drive to get to San Pedro. She had her heart set on seeing salt water taffy being made, etc, remembering this place from her youth. Well none of that was there. Not one single shop. There were several sea food restaurants with good food on the pier. We did end up taking a 45 minute boat ride around d the harbor for $10 that was nice. But basically we wasted four hours in the car to drive there for sea food that we could have gotten anywhere else. She was so disappointed, but after reading other reviews I expected it to be exactly what we found. There are better ways to waste your time. I should note it didn’t feel seedy as some reviewers have mentioned, I felt completely safe. There just is nothing here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brendavig

30,Making a Come Back,"We were here a couple of years ago and it was practically dead, however it is making a real comeback. There are three times as many businesses open as a few years ago. It still has a way to go. (a number of the buildings are condemned and are scheduled to be torn down), however they are building up and in another year will likely be back to the glory days. I am optimistic it will make a full recovery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/csarchibald
20,"Too bad,so sad","While the concept of boutiques and restaurants set up as little villages along the waterfront sounds like a great idea, this place has not kept up the maintenance and is looking rather tired. Because so much is closed the restaurants and fish market that are open get lost. Not sure about restrooms but there were potopotties aplenty. Also lots of security on site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eandmb

20,What a dump it has become.,"It is sad that Ports O' Call should be torn down, but it should. Take it down and start over. It is a mess on so many levels. There is not one good thing I can say about this place and I do try to find something nice to say.As a child I went there with my family. It was clean and fun. They had a few fine dinning places and if you just wanted to grab a hot dog you could do that. They had adorable shops and a few candy and ice cream places. It was super cute and we loved it.As an adult we took our own child. The place had changed, but it was okay. The best restaurants were gone, but the shops were there and ice cream could be had and a kid could have a blast as could the adults.As a grandparent I just took my grandson. It was awful. I mean really bad. It is dirty. Your shoes will get sticky. Those little shops are now closed up or the few left don't have a thing even a kid wants to buy.The place is now sort of broken up. There are the mostly empty shops and then there is a fish type market, where you order your food and eat there. It is a cross between Mexican food and bad seafood. The entire area is crowded and it is so dirty. It is crowded and because of that I thought, well, maybe I am missing something here. We ordered a fish taco and tried to find a place to sit. None being had, we stood. My grandson tasted the taco before I had a chance and immediately vomited. It was so bad. I try to find someone to help clean up the mess, and no one is to be found. I take him to a filthy bathroom to try to get him cleaned up. The fish was not even close to fresh and had such a smell. I was furious.We left never finding one person to help clean up, no napkins for me to do it myself. I will never go there again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid

10,Terrible and Tacky Tourist Trap!!!,"I had fond memories of Ports o Call village, a favorite destination for my family when we first arrived in the U.S. 35 years ago. My, how times have changed! And not for the better! Avoid this cheap tourist trap which was filled with screaming kids, and drunken couples on the recent Sunday we visited. The parking lot was absolutely packed full so it took quite some time to find a spot, which made it doubly frustrating when we found ourselves literally walking in one entrance and almost right out of another. There were many, many large groups, families and couples all wandering in and out of stores offering a cheap array of ""made in China"" items at inflated prices. The restaurants seem to specialize in large, sugary, overpriced cocktails and enormous plates of junk food. Considering it's location on the Long Beach waterfront, one would expect high quality seafood, so that was an additional disappointment. Truly worth avoiding unless your standards are gutter-low!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjjSD
50,"Love this restuarant, being on the water, watching ships, being outside near a heater when it gets cold even better","Best place ever for happy hour then stay on for dinner.

20,Shadow of a once charming past,"My father used to bring me here when I was growing up in the late 60s/early 70s. We always bought seashells to add to our collection and I looked forward to every visit. This was my first time back since 1980 and what an incredibly sad experience it was. It was like strolling thru a ghost town of closed up store fronts and abandoned buildings. We were there on a Friday at suppertime so I would think it should have been a busy time. What few stores were open had employees who seemed like they would rather be any place else and doing anything other than dealing with customers. The Fish Market next door, which could be named ‘Little Mexico’, was booming with business but the old village was deserted and sad. Either fix it up and breathe new life into it, or put it out of its misery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fincaran

40,Dated but Pleasant Area,"This is a lovely but somewhat dated area within San Pedro. We visited in February while renting a yacht via AirBnB in a berth nearby. There are multiple restaurants within the village and a few shops. In February, it seemed like not everything was open, so there might be more of a on/off-season that we weren't aware of. There is free parking in the lot and benches available if you'd like to watch the boats and ships transiting the harbor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wandermuffin
50,Step back from the rat race.,Great memories from my teen years. But this review is after we finished our 50-State Quest and made our only trip south in the Month of June ((2009 not 2016)). This was different from our normal vacations in that it was to see friends and eat at those places we have missed being here in Kelseyville. The Village has a bunch of little shops like in those small towns back east or even Pier 39 in the bay area. We have always like going there to make a stroll being tourist then take in a great meal. The best is the Ports O' Call Restaurant right on the waters edge. A two story building with a bar & outside seating but upstairs is the famous eatery that has this great view at any table watching the boats sail or drift by. You will also see those big cargo & cruse ships pass by. Day or night it's always good. We ate dinner this time but over the years we ate many a lunch also. They treat you like a first class place because that's what it is with good service to go along with the same in food. Your table can order the same drinks they serve downstairs. I don't drink anymore but when I did the tropical drinks were out of this world & there all good. This will always be a 5-star rating in my book in this must see place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaduckcoin

30,We Like Anything Near the Water !,"If you come from the flat Prairies with no water within miles, except a river here and there, you will undoubtedly like this Ports O' Call Village. The fishing boats, the ""fishy"" aroma, the wharfs, outdoor seating on the terrace, just that wonderful fresh air and all that water around you --- it may all be ""run-down and decrepit"" to some folks but to us, we love it.Looking at the live fish and large lobsters in the tank is fascinating. Some of our seafood restaurants back home (on the prairies) do have lobsters in the tank for viewing but .... OMG..... they are like little midget lobsters compared to what we see here.We stopped for fish and chips along with a cool beer on a weekday afternoon and it was delicious ! We also don't get much fresh fish on the prairies !So it may not be what it used to be to some folks --- but to us, it's a pleasant part of our visit to California. By the way, I lived in San Diego in the 1970's but never got to see the pristine Ports O' Call way back then. Too bad !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MKS2010
10,Am I missing something here? It's a Dump !,San Pedro is in general a complete dump and this place a sad excuse of a tourist attraction. Dirty and smelly and with many closed shops and restaurants.Absolutely nothing nice about it. Waste of time. Pretty much sums up the whole area of San Pedro.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markzz2
30,I Love Ports O Call,"You can't get fish any fresher than at Ports O Call. I love to sit in the restaurant and watch the fishing boats unload their catch on the dock while eating my super fresh fish. I've been going to Ports O Call for over 30 years. In the past 10 years or so, it's started looking a bit run down. Some of the businesses need to be remodeled inside and the furniture needs to be replaced. Because this venue is so old, it appears to be less than clean. But, I still love the place and will continue to go in spite of it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kl417g
30,Pretty quiet Saturday Late Morning,"Many places closed, even around noon on Saturday. Might better in the late afternoon. Ok for just a walk around.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AceWickwire
40,Nice place for happy hour on the waterfront deck.,"This is a comfortable place on a waterfront deck or inside dining by the picture windows. You can watch the ships sail in and out of the harbor, and sometimes see the seal who frequents the waters. Happy hour fare has been pared down in the last year or so, but you can get a burger or drinks for about $5-8 each. There are free veggies and dip, as well as nachos, and sometimes tacos, with the purchase of a drink. Reasonably priced seafood, beef, chicken and pasta dinners. Many evenings, especially in the summer, there is free music played by local musicians.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/716jar
20,A Post-Heyday Walk Among Decay and Emptiness,"I recall visiting the Ports O' Call village as a child, and though rife with shops of tchotchke and cheesy souvenirs, I greatly enjoyed the atmosphere of the waterfront village and its quaint maritime theming.That was close to two decades ago, at this point.Upon our visit in December 2016, my wife - who had never seen the Village at its prime - had me treat her to an eerie ambiance of closed storefronts and buildings in varying degrees of repair and disrepair. Only a few of the stores were opened at the time of our visit, subsequent to partaking of a Shrimp Tray at the fish market down the way. I recall wondering what sad series of events led to the decline of the village to where it found itself today, almost laying in state, in a sense.It had a quirky beauty all its own, if one is prone to appreciating urban decay in that sense, but as we were hoping to find nice and unique gifts to procure for Christmas, this simply was not the place to go. I don't know why the tchotchke shops which survived did, but they seemed to be the only ones still around - or at least open at the time of our late morning/early afternoon visit. But as a quiet dockside walk among long-closed buildings, abandoned storefronts, and empty rentals devoid of many other visitors, it was a pleasant enough stroll - just not what I was looking for at the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EarthMeauxFaux
40,Keep things in perspective...not so much for divas,"This village offers some fabulous treats if you keep things in the proper perspective. This is a fishing village that offers the freshest seafood at decent prices and some interesting cultural experiences off the beaten path of San Pedro. In fact these fish markets are way better than the ones on Redondo Pier in my opinion and I have lived in this area most of my life. It is no fancy Marina Del Rey but that is why I like it. It's simple, very casual, and affordable. Grab a cold beer or wine, listen to some mariachis, eat some fresh fish, and maybe grab an ice cream on my way out......that's it.The harbor cruise is fairly priced and great! I can be a diva but I have fun here if I take it for what it is. Yes, it is smelly...fish...duhhh. No, I don't hang out all day...yes it can get rowdy but I only go early for lunch and just for an hour or two. Plus they have security guards. I don't shop for anything else here and there are places that have indoor restrooms. You just need to look for them. It's fun to look at the fish in the tanks and for my meal.....I like the Crusty Crab. If the atmosphere is not desirable, sit inside the Crusty Crab instead of the patio.Lastly, I find it amusing to watch people use a mallet to crack open their crab and to see a whole fish... bones and all.. on a table with a whole family digging in! lol Weekdays are great time to take my son or early for the weekend before people get too drunk. For my diva friends...no I would never take them here....they wouldn't get it....I take them to Ports O' Call restaurant for Sunday brunch. Very different....very high end...and the brunch is awesome! ..Still this village is always...an adventure for foodies with an open-mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chefcookie1

10,Ghetto!!!! and Smelly!!,"What looks like used to be... a fun, family, seaside waterfront/ harbor attraction..is now a smelly, loud place that’s over crowded with locals- and ‘Disneyland-like’ extra long lines and wait at all the waterside poplar eateries . I could hear conversations laced with casual cursing around families with small kids - The shopping was narrowed down to cheap souvenirs and ladies sundresses (which was the only saving grace of this attraction ) I didn't bother to take the short Harbor Cruise - for fear the same loud crowd would be on it. I said “Never mind”The menu of beautiful, large trays of seafood (see photos), turned out to be no more than sloppy, messy, shrimps with all the veins (yuk!) you can eat - They said if you wanted deveined shrimp, you had to get them done at the fresh seafood market next door, and bring it over to cook-GOOD GRIEF !!!…and unless you buy your own handpicked fish - the ‘restaurant-ready’ fish is always cheap Tilapia-….So that’s now 2 very long lines to stand in!. Other seafood like lobster oyster and crab were priced through the roof!!!About 12oz. of a Pineapple Smoothie, poured inside a fresh pineapple was $18. !…I won’t be back - Sloppy seafood - messy looking eateries! …And to bring it all home…the Waterfront uses mostly Port-A-Potties! - and Port a-Sinks for hand washing, that was ALWAYS OUT OF SOAP OR WATER!!! on my visit... and around all that smelly, germy fish?? Really?…and this is supposed to be popular attraction/ tourist destination in San Pedro, CA ?… Fix It! San Pedro!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lele767
30,Crowded but interesting,"We visited on Mother's Day (our cruise ship was docked for the day nearby) so it was quite crowded. Lots of restaurants that seem to blend together. We took a harbor cruise that was very interesting. Since this was our first visit, I can't comment on how it was in the past. If we had more time and it wasn't so crowded we would have eaten at one of the restaurants as the fist was probably very fresh.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unknown_Traveler
20,Needs some help,Have not been here for many years and I don't think that we will ever go back. It has really changed. It seems that now it's just a large fish market with a couple of stores. We were there on a Tuesday around and 3 and most of the stores were closed. That really was not a bad think because the stores were for the most part run down and honestly kinda trashy. There were a few that were nice. If you want to buy fish then head down they do have a pretty good variety there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/love-road-life
10,Skip It,"This place is quite seedy, run down and full of really questionable people. We were hoping to get some great pictures of the Iowa as well as the huge ships loading and unloading goods.What we saw is that almost the entire waterfront area is taken up with restaurants and your view is completely blocked by them. Scary that each restaurant had a security guard at it's entrance who not only checked the people out, but did searches of women's purses and any other bags one might be carrying. I don't even want to ponder why this is necessary.There are a few shops open selling mostly low quality junky souvenirs and some clothing. A long line of portable toilets also blocks some of the small view you have of the docks. One small walkway gave us a small glimpse of the port itself, but there was such a long line of people there waiting to get on a boat tour of the area you couldn't see much of anything. It's definitely a creepy sort of area, so much so that I kept my hand with my wedding ring in my pocket for safety.Unless they revamp and clean up this area, pass it by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/941JudyC

20,Past its prime and but full of potential,"My family used to go there as a standard stop for our out of town visitors - a good way to see the harbor, stroll around cute shops and maybe have lunch. Now there is a very large and highly active fish market with a slew of little eateries adjacent to it (it may have always been there but I don't remember it that large). The shopping area is a lot of empty stores and others with lots of souvenir tchotchkes. At the very end is a jewelry store that has some very lovely items -- that was worth the trip down memory lane. If you are in the harbor area, it is a pleasant place to visit, but I wouldn't make a special trip to it as it is small, a little dirty and, with the except of the jewelry store and couple of other quaint little stores, not worth a special trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TamraL593

It is actually very easily accessed via the 110s Freeway. It was clean (albeit could use more bathrooms), had fun food stall options (loved the ceviche tacos and other fish choices) and best of all, choices of cruises to take from short harbor tours to 2 hour whale-watching trips to even longer adventures.

It is a lot more run down than in earlier days. Plenty of shops and restaurants. I like sitting so close to the fishing boats in the harbor. It was Armed Forces Day so there were Para gliders and WWII airplanes flying overhead. The restaurants are very reasonably priced. Very popular with neighborhood families.

The candy store remained but felt dirty and I didn't want to eat anything that had been there. Bye childhood fondness.And where we had planned to have lunch: any of the Fisherman's Wharf-style fish market joints with fresh sea food and a view to the harbor - had been taken over by dirty, Tijuana-style bars and was overrun by Mariachi music and thugs.

30,Excellent Food - less than average surrounding,"it's been years since I'd returned to the village for some of that great fresh seafood… i would have to agree with many it's run down, smells like trash until you get into the walk way with shops and dining. Lots of families there. plenty of area for sitting/eating on the waterfront. The food was breathtaking. we had grilled Red Snapper, Tilapia, Shrimp with vegetables and potatoes with a spicy flavor to them… it was served on a huge tray… we ate like Kings. If you're down around Long Beach/San Pedro and have to have that fresh seafood mexican twist flavor - try this out. i should mention its a tad on the pricey side… priced like a 4 or 5 star restaurant with a 1 star quality/cleanliness appeal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/digdeep0169
10,Total Disappointment,"So run down, dirty! We were surprised to find the parking lots almost empty! We walk through the little shopping area, most of the shops were closed, the ones open had really junkie stuff or imports from Baja Mexico. Restaurants were doing a good business, but did not look very clean. All the families and panhandlers spoke Spanish, did not hear English. Felt like I was in Mexico. It may have been a nice place 40 years ago, not worth getting out of the car now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatH507
30,"Run down,kinda sad","Run down, nothing like it was back in the day, almost a ghost town. Few shops, several closed. Didn't even recognize it, I came years ago, if I didn't know better I would have thought it was different place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmilyE699
20,What a shame - so much opportunity!!,"It has the location, the space but is so down market!It gets busy with families and groups on Sundays - the food is fresh but cooked 'fast food.'The drinks are overpriced and it is dirty, very dirty!It's such a great location and tons of potential but the current owners are making money so they have neglected the location!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CientoVeinte
10,A waste of your time,"If you have time before or after a cruise, do not waste your time here. Go eat at the Green Onion a couple blocks away if you want Mexican food or try the fish an chips at Blu, the restaurant in the Crowne Plaza, also a couple of blocks away from the cruise terminal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lagnaf35
20,Cut and paste from others,"I had to stop and see for myself - I remember going here as a kid and it seemed really nice. But all the reviews are pretty much right on. Nothing new or different to say. It needs a major over-haul and looks and feels like a dirty, village south of the border with the feel of a fair. Move on and don't waste your time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AdvtrTrvlr
10,A bitter sweet experience,"It's been at least 10 years since I have last visited this little New England like village. It used to have so much character, interesting shops, and restaurants. I'm sad to see and report that it is very run down, dirty, and has evolved into a Tijuana/Rosarito Beach kind of place. Most of the eateries' menus are for Mexican style cooked foods. On Saturday afternoon, the lines for food were very long. No open tables. This place was jam packed. A Spanish speaking only environment, Spanish only entertainment, and enough gang members to take over Los Angeles. As a precaution, there were lots of security and law enforcement present. A must since there is so much alcohol being served. Now, I decided to try the food anyway. Ate at the outdoor Fisherman's Seafood restaurant, and I have to report that I tried a shrimp cocktail, talapia, and calamari and was very impressed. The best calamari I've ever had!! The food was delicious! Unfortunately, unless the eateries can clean the place up, serve more traditional American seafood favorites, and call America's Most Wanted to rid society of the less desirables, I won't be coming back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariannem978
10,Ugh! Totally run down,"This place used to be nice with interesting stores and good restaurants. Now this place is filled with cheesy gift shops, restaurants that certainly aren't special, and grounds that are not kept up. It's like the owners of this village have thrown in the towel and let whatever happens happen. This place used to be a great place to take your family and stroll from store to store. Now, the crowd is a little different (let's just say that you see lots of tattoos everywhere).I would never go back until they decide to invest some money and fix the place up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
40,Like Mexico without having to cross the border,"If your expectation is a clean, unauthentic, touristy, Disneyland type place, Ports O'Call Village is not for you. This faux New England coastal ""village"" probably started out that way. However, it has morphed over the years. Now it is packed by Latino families on weekends enjoying fish and shrimp fajita platters, shrimp and ceviche cocktails, beer, mariachis and fun. The energy and buzz reminds me of Mexico. Almost everyone speaks Spanish (including the Asian bartender dispensing beer) and you will probably not see a single white person except the occasional tourist about to board a boat to go on a harbor cruise or my husband :). The food is not cheap and the lines long on weekends but the portions are generous. Expect to peel your own shrimp and get your hands dirty. I love this place because it reminds me of Mexico and if you are looking for an authentic Mexican family experience without driving another three hours and crossing the border, this is where to go. You order your food indoors at one of numerous restaurants and then sit outside overlooking the harbor, which is a working port. Great place to people watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squirrelmama

10,They Let This Place Go!,"Wow...have they let this go! We used to go here a few times a year when we first moved to LA and it was nice. Went back for the Lobster Fest a couple of weeks ago and man...this place turned into a dump. Place is in a state of disrepair and all the shops sell nothing but junk. It now looks like a dirty flea market. Parking is a pain. On a side note.....don't go to the Lobster Fest. What a big waste of money. Food was not very good (over cooked and not fresh all), everything was overpriced (cheap flat beer was $7.00 for a cup), the grounds were dirty, and all the vendors were selling cheap garbage. My wife's grandma loved going here...she would cry if she saw how this place went downhill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/general5star1962

10,too many people! so little room!,"I was there yesterday with family since we had never stayed to eat. Most of the time, It was just to take a stroll or buy fish at 5am. Sunday early afternoon, there was absolutely no parking available. There was hoards of people everywhere. The ladies room line was a mile long; only had one toilet. Not to mention, there was no where to sit to order food and have a nice lunch. Did I mention there was hoards of people everywhere? We finally did find a place to sit only to be disturbed every few minutes from people asking if we were ""almost done"" so they could take our spot. This was a very uncomfortable experience. Food: the tray of shrimp and veggies with some garlic bread was ok. I can say the bread had more flavor than the shrimp tray. I can assure I will not come here again at anytime that isn't in the morning when the food service is starting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Godihvaps
20,Too many changes,We used to go here years ago and decided to go back again. So many of the nice shops have left and now it's a bunch of touristy etc. from all over the world. Guess it fits an area that receives ships from all over but there are still many shops closed down and the restaurants have changed. Lost its charm for us but many others may enjoy it. They do have entertainment on the week-end. It was really nice. Peruvian music. Loved it. Food area has expanded too large. Noisy and crowded. Too many smells mixing together not very appealing. People there did not seem to mind so good for them. No romance here unless you walk around there quieter area of the shops that are still there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaPuenteCA

10,Stay Away,"Sadly, Ports O'Call Village use to be a great place. I loved sitting on the patio of Ports O' Call Restaurant and watching the ships go by. Went there the other night and their service was crappy--they aren't even trying anymore. Walked around the Village and it's like Tijuana now. Tons of fish restaurants packed with people, shrimp plates, alcohol and mariachi bands. It looked fun at first but it smelled bad, the lines for the restrooms were long, all the places looked dirty and I seriously wondered how clean the food would be. If you are a tourist (heck, even if you are a local), don't waste your time here. You will be seriously disappointed. Cross the bridge into Long Beach and go to the Pike or Shoreline Village. Much cleaner, good restaurants and beautiful waterfront. Ports O'Call is just gross now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ljinbs
20,A Waste of Time,"For years I had heard so much about Ports of Call Village and the different shops and stores. Wow, what a disappointment. Almost all the stores looks like stores going out of business. The restaurants were dirty and not worth eating at and the trolley that is suppose to come every 15 minutes never showed up! Never going back here again, unless they fix it up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MamaBear63
10,Gone Way Downhill,"This is a location perfectly wonderful to bring family and friends for a nice and safe either Mexican or seafood dinner.

It was so nice 10-30 years ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pschenck
40,Good despite many negative reviews,"Lot's of reviewers have bashed this place but I choose to look at the positive. It may appear a bit run down but I believe it's because it's not the best of times for small business or tourism...that said I saw many truck crews trimming trees and cleaning the parking lot and surrounding areas. Parking is free...and maybe they should institute fee to help offset the cost of upkeep, but then I'm sure many would grumble about that.Simple stated it is a collection of local shops, many focused on local crafts, nautical themes, and such. There are many restaurants with varied menus and outside seating. I simply enjoyed the walk amongst many locals, the aroma from the sea and restaurants and simple conversation If you are looking for an upscale mall you are in the wrong place, but if you want a laid back stroll and little pressure to make a purchase it's a great place to walk. In the mood for a good meal with a great view...it may be hard to choose which place to dine at.I do want to point out I had to use the public rest area and pleasantly surprised to find it clean and without odor.If you want to pay a fee I'm sure you can travel to a seaside tourist trap, but for a laid back stroll and some good conversation this is a good safe place to go. Also be sure to cross the parking lot and take a walk by the fishing vessels and even talk to those who may be working on their boats, maybe you to will strike up a conversation with the captain of one of the ships featured on the DEADLIEST CATCH, a Discovery Channel Show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryG668
50,So So Disappointed...,"When I was a kid, my folks took us to visit this wonderful place called Ports O' Call. All the buildings were themed to look like a quaint seaside village. The myriad shops were filled with fantastic, whimsical and beautiful things to look at. It was what I compared Seaport Village to when our family moved to San Diego years later.Recently, we had the opportunity to revisit this wonderful place. As we approached it, it looked just like my memories. It was in the shadow of where where Disney and other major cruise lines depart as well as the LA Maritime Museum.That's when things changed. Oy.How disappointed I was when I went into the first store. Apparently, whoever is managing this place has sold out to the short dollar. They have rented space to the people better suited to swap meets and sidewalk vendors. While the original buildings remain the same as they once were, the Ports O' Call of today reminds me of the cheap and dodgy marketplaces you find along the streets in the darker parts of places like Tijuana or disreputable carnivals. To say it's bad is an understatement. Stores filled with nothing but off color and rude stickers, t-shirts and hats, most in Spanish. Most have trinkets that can be found in the Oriental Trading Catalog, but way overpriced. Many places blast music both inside and out that from club sized speakers that has nothing to do with their store's items. Another particular store was completely silent with the exception of the disinterested employee watching a blaring foreign television channel while chowing down on something pungent and fetid. We didn't stay in that store very long. To take my description of the place as a border market, one store sold only Tijuana souvenirs. And I'm not talking about the types of things you might find in Tijuana. I mean, most items had the words ""Recuerdo de Tijuana, Mexico"" written on them!The dining area used to be filled with choice seafood dining establishments. Nowadays for the most part it's beer and deep fried fish in a bucket. And that's just the sit downs. The outside, quickservice places reminded me directly of county fair food - greasy and expensive, not to mention the rude and lackadaisical service. Yes, I sound like a snob, but when you're paying $48 for chicken, burgers and fries, wouldn't you be that way too? There are bands of amateur mariachi musicians roving the fiberglass tables loudly hawking their wares to anyone who makes the mistake of catching their eyes along with badly made up clowns selling inflatable knockoffs of cartoon characters.However, there are a few holdouts from the old days. There is one fine art store that has been there since the mid 60's that still maintains a certain decorum and insists that guests do so as well. We stopped in and the owner shared stories of celebrities both old and new. There are is a handmade jewelry store at the extreme end that seems to do well. There is a candy store that really makes the extra effort, even going so far as to walk you to the door to thank you for coming.Needless to say, unless you're trying to combine a cheesy border visit with a harbor cruise, I would give Ports O' Call a pass. It is definitely not what it used to be and certainly isn't what it claims to be now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wraithdude

10,Completely Ghetto and Dirty!,"I can remember going to Ports O' Call as a kid and it was certainly not like how it is today. Apparently the free parking is there to offset the chance that your car might get broken into, just walking from the parking lot to the trashy shorelined seafood ""restaurants"" you can see a mix of garbage, litter and plenty of gangmember looking guys complete with neck tattoos, L.A. County lock up must bus them in.Against my better judgment we decided to have lunch there, my wife ordered a tray that was suppose to be shrimp fajitas this soupy over spiced slop was served on a piece of wax paper on a tray, maybe to make the homies on parole feel more at home but I doubt the trays were clean. Our Fajitas were served with garlic bread?? I took a couple bites and just decided to eat at home later.While we were seated a security guard came up to us and told us to move, apparently there is assigned seating!Overall, Watch your car, don't get stabbed and don't eat there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Andre2411
40,Interesting View,"Some people love the place, others hate it. I like it. Ports O'Call Village is a shopping and restaurant area in San Pedro beside the harbor. As you might expect, there are fish restaurants, clothing stores with beach ware, and shops selling things nautical. There is plenty of free parking (two hours) and a stroll beside the harbor. If you like watching big boats, there are always large ships passing by and unloading. Within walking distance is the Maritime Museum, the Battleship USS Iowa Museum, and nearby other points of interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
10,"Dirty,rundown,third world ghetto..","We just decided to visit Ports O' Call Village for lunch after touring the U.S.S Iowa. It's only a few blocks away from the ship and I thought it would be a great way to extend our day. How truely depressing, it reminded me of the scene in ""Back To The Future"" when Marty McFly discovers how his town has decayed with the passing of time. Years ago, this used to be an upscale, seaside plaza full of interesting shops and great restaurants. This no longer exists. It is now filthy and unmaintained and seems to be more of a ""hangout"" destination than for shopping or dining. Loud blaring music and crowds of screaming children, I would rather remember the village from years ago, than to have seen what time has done to what was once a nice place. Call me Marty McFly.

There are monuments dotted along the promenade a Maratime museum some great fish resteraunts and the latest attraction the Battleship USS OHIO. We spent about an hour on board.(there are lots of stairs to climb) We really enjoyed it my 17 year old said it was fab and cool so I guess it must be.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManchesterJeterfan

20,Really disappointing,"I think at one time, this area was really nice and fun. It's not kept up very well now and several stores are closed. It's not quite a ghost town yet. Shop keepers seem to be less than inviting and friendly. It struck me a sir they are sick of tourists, so they don't even say hello or can I help you.Only two stores greeted me, one being the art gallery and the other was.....oh no, I can't remember the name of the store, and she was so kind and sweet!!! She has jewelry, metal signs, memorabilia of movie stars, recording artists, a variety of souvenirs and is located at the southern end of the shopping.

50,A Big Hispanic Party - Loved it!,"We were staying at the nearby Doubletree, San Pedro and wanted somewhere to eat on that Saturday night.We almost avoided the Ports O' Call (dreadful name) expecting some twee, artificial, sterlised tourist trap, but so glad we made the last-minute decision to turn into the large car park (take careful note of where you park!). We found a huge party going on with a, largely, Hispanic clientele having a great fiesta on their Saturday night out.We live in Spain and felt really at home. Bands playing, women singing, hardly heard above the babble of people having REAL fun!Collect your seafood from one of the many counters and then sit down at the big stainless steel-topped tables.

One is more ethnic with a lot of large families and groups getting their el 7 mares on as well as fried (insert your favorite seafood item here) with fries, oysters on the half shell on the side. The second part is a few restaurants and shops on the other side serving cafe type food. Guess which part has better food?I wouldn't visit the first part at night, not with the plastic 40 oz and other beverages available, and the second part I wouldn't want to fall asleep from the boredom.As far as the view, you can see the water and the docks... great okay... nothing to see here, there are far better locations in Socal to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davensd

Dining choices from Mexican to Seafood to snacks. It just seriously needs to be cleaned up, and repainted.So - this is the truth. If things that are no longer sparkling turn you off - you will not like several aspects of Ports O Call. But, if that doesn't bother you - you will definately find this area worth exploring. And DO enjoy a harbor cruise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBsleepsurveyor
40,Big ships. ..another side of LA,"Biggest tip: bring cash, debit, credit cards not always accepted at stores and restaurants here.I went to Ports O' Call village on a visit to LA and was taken there on the recommendation of friends--they wanted to show me a different side of the greater Los Angeles area. First, seeing the largest port in the world is amazing. It's a whole different side of LA--we drove in from Downtown and seeing the harbor and all its works, machinery, and hardware was a site in itself. This ""village"" (they are trying for New England architecture, I don't know why. .. ) is nestled near the harbor water and, therefore, they have played up the ""fishing village"" aspect of the place. There are many shops (mostly artisans or kitch) and many restaurants. I also believe you can take boat tours, helicopter tours, and other types of water tours from here once you arrive in the ""village.""We ate a restaurant that has a working fish market inside. You pick out your fish or seafood (many types) and then have them cook it up for you. No waiters--this is unique and great. It was a large group of people I was with, so I didn't catch the name of the restaurant--but it's rather large and further down the ""village"" area near a store that sells ""African"" and Caribbean type merchandise. (It was a whirlwind day--and I was the guest, so sorry about not remembering the name--look for a reddish, large, low building with its back right on the water and a HUGE outdoor seating area in the back--you've found it.)Los Angeles is populated by working class Mexican American people who serve so many industries in the city, and from the looks of it, they love this restaurant. You will see couples, families with children, workers, etc.--all indications of how popular the place is and how good the food value is. . .This population is not a detriment, this IS the real Los Angeles. At the restaurant you'll find outdoor picnic tables right on the water on a huge deck. We had a large party, so here's what we did. A few of us who were familiar with the restaurant, went to the ""market"" area and ordered our food--large plates (more soon). Others of us went and secured a picnic table area for our group.We decided on huge plates for the table (you can buy POUNDS of shrimp or fish). Those who ordered food got to choose the seafood they desired (mmm) and then took it over to the kitchen area inside and had the cooks cook the food. We had a fajita style of sautéed grilled fresh shrimp. These were coated in a special seasoning, grilled with vegetables and served on a huge platter that we all fed from--delicious. This also came with grilled bread. We also ordered fried tilapia--also cooked and selected right there as well.Those of us who sat at the table went over in smaller groups to the drinks stand where you purchase your beverages, out on the large outdoor deck. They sell beer, soda--CA$H only. And we all then commenced to eat once the ""food getters"" returned. This is an extremely casual atmosphere, much like the beach restaurants one finds all over the US--minus the beach, big ships instead! Roaming musicians who play mariachi, conjunto, norteno, and other types of regional Mexican music filter through the tables and enhance the atmosphere with their talents.There's also large screen TVS sprinkled around and a soccer game was being broadcast--of much interest to many at the restaurant.Afterwards, we were stuffed and satiated and wandered through the village looking at shops, taking in the smell of the ocean, the sight of big ships, and enjoying the beautiful California weather. Up the road as you drive out of this area there are indoor, retail malls and shops--like all other cities.If you are up for something different, don't want something expensive, and not scared of being part of the melange of the US, I suggest taking a hearty appetite and an open heart (shouldn't you take these to everywhere you visit?) and enjoying the port of Los Angeles--a place where ships from all over the world bring goods to the US and carry them out as well. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/historia34

Grab a drink, take your fish outside to the picnic tables next to the ocean, toss some garlic bread to the seagulls, watch the gigantic cruise ships drift by and enjoy.
