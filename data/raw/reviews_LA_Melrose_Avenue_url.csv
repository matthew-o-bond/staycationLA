Took a walk towards a park and look at the doggie playground, then purchased some healthy drinks which were actually disgusting to drink, but it was part of the experience.

I used to compare it to Kings Road in the swinging 60's in London....as our own version of that. No more.Tacky tacky tacky...with a few cool places thrown into the mix, for sure...but not worth trying to park or walk blocks between them.",MilkmaidTS

I'd suggest starting at La Cienega...",CaraMHutchins
30,Visit to DASH,I walked to Melrose Ave specifically to visit the DASH store (being a closet Kardashian fan). If you love shopping and people watching it's excellent!DASH itself is great if you are the perfect figure with deep pockets.

There are some great coffee shops too where you can sit and watch life pass by.",the travelling foodie

20,It's heyday is over.....,"I live a few blocks away. It is disappointing but this area as well as many parts of West Hollywood have become overpriced both to rent or buy merchanidise and attract very few of the original artist or creative types anymore.Melrose Ave in the 80's and 90's was full of all kinds of shops drawing people up and down all day. Now it is spotty at best with many empty buildings. Unless you knew how it was, I suppose you think that a few clothing shops, or tattoo places, and few restaurants is great. Well It is only a fraction of what it use to be. I would drive down the street to check it out. If you see something then stop, It really is not worth devoting time as a destination anymore.",John L
30,Melrose Avenue vintage shopping,If you're into Vintage clothing then Melrose Avenue is worth a visit to browse in the shops and I say browse because they are expensive.

40,A Great Walk,"We recently wandered down Melrose from around Sweetzer (where our hotel was located) to LaBrea. It was a beautiful day and the window shopping and people watching was excellent. We watched the shops go from posh, to trash, to hip. The people (even the other tourists) ran the gamut of the same!

40,Melrose Ave,"An interesting strip of shops, cafes and restaurants. There is something for everybody here, from high end designers down one end to second-hand shops down the other. It also has the chain stores like Urban Outfitters. A mix of places to stop and eat/drink also. We enjoyed Melrose Ave so much the first time that we returned our next stop in LA, especially since it is outside as opposed to an indoor shopping mall (but in saying this the Beverly Centre is awesome for shopping). Melrose Ave is also relatively close to the Farmers Markets.",AEM967
30,Ummm...,"Okay...There are some cute shops that are worthy of patronage, for sure, but I don't like a lot of the styles Melrose promotes, considering that jeans with huge holes in them fetch thousands of dollars merely because the label sewn inside is ""prestigious""...Also, so many of the clothes are poorly constructed.There are three or four shops I do, and will continue to, shop at, when appropriate, but otherwise, use your money for clothing that suits you, not an image!",marybelle08
30,Not what I expected,"My daughter adored the shopping experience while I could have gone without. Many of the stores carry the exact same thing so it was like walking into the same store over and over again... and the stores worth visiting you can find anywhere really. Robertson, Beverly Center etc. That being said, it was still a fun day and it made my daughter happy so we most likely will return to shop when we are in LA again. (People watching was pretty amazing though)",sawracki

40,Always nice to shop,"First off, I really like the concept of a shopping street more then a typical Mall. The Melrose Avenue was always very trendy, creative and still is but in recent years badly a lot of good shops closed down. Luckily there are some of the best shops in town left and so It's really worth a visit. When you want some original clothing and not 08/12 stuff, shop @ the Melrose Avenue.",ChrisMatador
50,"An excellent, fun afternoon","Anyone who isn't wholly entertained by a long day on Melrose, is probably old, and gets their fashion sense from J C Penney.We live only about 35 miles from West Hollywood and go here often. My two late teens kids love it. There are several dark fashion/goth stores where everyday is Halloween (lol), the obligatory tattoo/piercing parlors, and there are also trendy stores, like SLOW, Marz Boutique, and Wasteland, where you can buy vintage, designer, and modern clothing. American Vintage has a huge store with a huge selection of clean used clothing and boots from the 1930's and on. Service varies from store to store, but I can't say any particular one has remarkably bad service or staffs.There's also plenty of restaurants with good food for a snack and for a full meal. Pink's Hot Dogs is just back on La Cienega, and if you start early enough, you can beat the lines.Melrose Ave. is like the shops at Venice Beach without the beach. You can also work your way down Melrose to Santa Monica Blvd. and on to BH and Rodeo Dr., depending on your energy levels!",GaryMon

While walking down Melrose, there were many Chabad individuals walking the street. We were stopped many times, asked if we were Jewish (which we replied with a yes), and then proceeded to pray and blow on the shofar. It was the first day of the Jewish New Year. Since we were away, we felt we did something to celebrate the holiday. Lots of characters walking around the area.",vaso815

A fun day could be had walking the length of it and popping in here and there. Now, it totally boring. One or two of the older places are still there shopping habits have changed and I think they are deluged by looky-loos.

40,My Visit to the Melrose Spa,"I walked to Melrose Spa, which is at 7269 Melrose on the evening of October 2.........it was a poor choice of times to visit, but if at all possible I like to visit a bathhouse when I go to a large city.The Spa is a sex hookup business, simply stated............gay sex. Along those lines, my expectations were low, since it was Tuesday.Anyway, this was one of the cleanest baths I've been to. My only real annoyance was that some of the walls and rails in the maze were sticky............that's a common issue in baths. The water in the hot tub seemed well-balanced and clean. There was a slight bathtub ring, but it was minimal, and could have been caused by one bozo that didn't shower before getting in the water. The steam room was nice, with what looked like new tile. I did notice that the hot water in the showers took a long time to get there; I showered cold, which kinda ruined the mood. I didn't see any trash/ wrappers on the floor. I didn't get a room, for financial reasons, instead, I got a locker. The lockers are right up front where the desk person can keep an eye on them. Most places have lock boxes for valuables, this one didn't, but padlocks on the lockers seemed adequate.The desk person, there was only one (it was around 9pm) was a very nice, attractive young man which made my short, uneventful stay enjoyable.I'll go back, but probably on a Friday or Saturday night.",sonlover83501

There were vintage items as well as modern, and art such as jewelry and playing cards. One man had an installation of objects that were not for sale, just to walk-through.

I wouldn't go east of la brea unless you're going to golden apple comics which is just east of labrea. The farther west you go, the nicer the street gets.You're gonna see some record stores, a bunch of really bizarre clothing shops, a few restaurants, and a lot of vintage clothing stores before you hit fairfax. If it's early in the day, eat at blu jam. If it's late, try vinoteque.After fairfax the stores get a little bit more pricey and after crescent heights you can start to find some designer stores, a couple fancy bakeries and some juice bars.

30,over rated - not what it used to be,"Not what it used to be...10+ years ago Melrose avenue was more Bohemian with shops and restaurants ranging from tattoos to shoes, vintage clothing, burgers, car washes, specialty lighting, antiques and bike fix-it shops. There was a fun ""hip"" feel to meandering down the famous avenue. Always alive with pedestrians and traffic there was an almost small town ""buzz."" There were the few ""fancier"" boutiques and expensive designer stores mixed in for interest. Now almost all of the little shops have been either abandoned or replaced by expensive names like Alexander McQueen (ahem) and whoever has that Pepto Pink building near Crescent Heights and of course the ""anchor"" of the avenue Fred Segal (restaurant and clothing store? hmmm never did get that one)...but I digress. If you still wish to tour, shop, dine or otherwise check out the Melrose strip be sure to bring lots of $$$ unless of course you plan on window shopping and wasting an hour or so waiting in line at Pink's hot dog stand. (That's a whole other one-star review though).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/topjoe
50,A cool place to shop,"Melrose Avenue - such an iconic spot to shop. What I love about this famous strip is that it changes so much from one end to the next. Starting on the West side, it becomes apparent that this is real high end shopping at it's best. There are some very big names along this strip and this continues for quite some way. You'll need to save megabucks if you want to shop up big in this area. But it's quite a beautiful stretch of road to see all the designer digs and homewares.An absolute must for lunch is Crossroads Restaurant, just on the corner of Sweetzer Avenue. It's a beautiful restaurant that is ripe for celebrity spotting, not to mention a beautiful meal.As you begin heading eastbound, the shops start to take on an interesting twist. What was once high end fashionist heaven, soon becomes funky, unique boutique shops. You will get some magnificent original pieces once you get past Fairfax Avenue.There are your big brands like American Apparel and Urban Outfitters, but be sure to check out American Vintage and Sportie LA for some really cool finds.Johnny Rockets, the original hamburger joint, is along this strip and you'll be sure to find loads of really cool retro vintage thrift shops and bohemian boutiques the further along you go.If you make it all the way along, head to Larchmont Boulevard and turn south, just off the corner is Cafe Gratitude which is a beautiful place to rest your feet and get a healthy, wholesome meal in a vibrant and peaceful setting.Melrose Avenue definitely has something for everyone is is far more affordable than Rodeo Drive. It's a fabulous place to find a bargain, but also to do some really unique boutique-style shopping without all that mass-produced stuff you find in all the chain stores. Have a good look in the thrift shops though, there are some pretty incredible finds to be discovered in here and some equally eccentric characters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChantalTee

40,Cool clothing Shops restaurants and overpriced everything,As a local I have bought items on melrose that until this day people compliment and state that they've never seen before.They have some clothing stores that carry one of kind (expensive) items.A variety of shoe stores and well as amazing restaurants.I would recommend this to any one who loves shopping but doesn't like having the same things as everyone else.Park somewhere on the side streets just pay attention to the parking signs so you don't get a ticket. Start walking where you see shops all the way down to fairfax high school.

It is a place to get a nice table on the first floor if with a group or get one in the balcony if one wants a bird's eye view of this very good restaurant where people like to go. I first found this excellent restaurant by posting a forum post on Trip Advisor and thanks goes to the LA group for directing me to now a favorite restaurant on Melrose.I also like the Village Idiot - its more a lively restaurant, good place to have a beer and enjoy some great food.There seems to always be another great restaurant to try in this area.

40,Funky one-of-a-kind shopping,"As one shopkeeper so eloquently told me: ""people come to Melrose ave. for funky not for basics"", thanks...really helped me find the sandals I was looking for. That being said don't come to Melrose looking for the perfect clothing item you have been searching for, come to Melrose to buy that funky dress or shoes that you know you can't get at home. As the avenue gets closer to Malibu the shops get more of a designer feel so there is plenty to shop for everyone. Yes, some of the stores are ""sketchy"" but don't force yourself to be edgy and super uncomfortable. There are plenty of fun stores from second hand to designer to explore and a full day is the only way to shop Melrose Avenue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/the_impasta_
40,Scruffy cutting edge fashion shopping,Unless you are young and interested in the newest trends you will probably not find anything which you would like to wear. Nevertheless it is fun to browse through the items in second hand shops or small trendy designer shops.Some hints and suggestions:- Free parking is available in side streets.- If you have enough after an hour or so turn south and stroll through one of the really nice residential areas with charming old houses.- When you hit W 3rd street turn right and walk until you see The Grove and Farmers Market which are both highly recommendable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarlosC172

After our lunch in Village Idiot, we continue driving towards Marc Jacobs store.. The scene is getting nicer and the area much more cleaner and much more safer to walk around. There's this giant billboard, a street parallel to Melrose Avenue, which says"" the fashion district, etc,etc"".

50,Easy Hip Vibe - Restaurants & Current/Vintage Shopping,"Love the vibe of Melrose Avenue. From the new current fashion designs to great vintage shopping, this the area to discover in LA. My husband and I found off-the-beaten path restaurants and sunny patio restaurants with umbrellas. Finding just the right place to have lunch with so many choices was fun as we menu shopped! We went to his pick, an outside patio, beer garden. Loved the vintage shopping from store to store. There are not many reviews of this area, so it could be missed very easily.Melrose Avenue was on my list of things to do on this visit to LA. Funny, because one of our friends in Beverly Hills mentioned Melrose Avenue, without a hint, and told my husband to explore this area before we left. Even though he did not want to experience an afternoon of shopping, or carrying bags, he engaged and enjoyed the day. I think the beer garden had something to do with this surprise! Definitely worth a visit. I could see where the area is becoming more upscale. I hope Melrose doesn't lose it's vintage, hip vibe!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA

40,Melrose Ave. Trendy Street,"Melrose is that trendy street in West LA, where restaurants, vintage clothing, and antique shops are found. Back in the day, when I used to go to Melrose, the place was bustling with people, and all walks of life, and even then the shops had a hefty price tag, although you could still find an inexpensive coffee shop. Today it much more expensive, but worth a visit. I would still go to Melrose, especially if you are a first time visitor, it is worth the walk up and down the Avenue. To me Melrose is a part of my history that I will never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoriF714
40,Cool way to see LA,"If you don't like shopping then don't bother taking a stroll down Melrose Ave. It is a cool street with a variety of stores. If you are visiting LA it is probably worth a couple hours of your time to visit Melrose. Remember, it is LA so the roads you will be walking alongside are very busy and quite loud. It is probably not the best thing to do with toddlers/young children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelgal12698

10,Vera Wang review ONLY,"I would like to know, how does one get a dress that is tailor made for them and then get charged alteration fees??? If it is made for me and I mean tailor made for me had to pay a rush fee of $500 to get it here at the 3 month mark, how can it finally get here and then I get gouged for more money as an ""alteration fee"" when its tailor made for me!!!!I left Vera Wang today so frustrated and upset with my decision. I FELT VIOLATED. Yes the dress is beautiful, but would I have gotten it for this price if I knew how much they would tag on as fees, NEVER!!When I came to this store there was so much politics and lies involved. There were 2 dresses that were in the running and I really had a hard time deciding between the 2, when I decided on the more expensive dress they told me ""oh we've already put the order in for the other one so why don't you leave all your credit card information and we'll let you know Monday which dress the factory is going to make"". Right, so I'm supposed to believe that you have an opportunity to make the more expensive dress and charge me more and you're not going to take it?SUCH A SCAM. I already had had enough and then today to get told I need to pay $1200 in alterations when I've already paid $500 and the dress is TAILOR MADE FOR ME.I want every bride to know how ridiculous this institution is.I was approached by Tara who is their manager, who decided to talk to be about my previous review.Apparently these are not made to order dresses. When they ordered the dress they ordered a size 8 which I was shocked at because I have a large bust. I thought they were going to order a size 12 and shrink the rest of the dress down to fit. But they ordered a 8 and had to increase the bust size and charge me $600. I was told by Tara that the length of the bust to bellybutton doesn't matter between a size 6 or 12 and so it would have had the same problem if it was a size 12, which is a lie. That's not possible, a larger size dress has more fabric period.This is why my bikini top is a size 10-14, when my bikini bottom is a 4 or 6, the larger top size has more fabric. A size 14 dress has more fabric than size 4, and not only that its longer so I didn't agree with her notions that they are the same.On to my point, Vera wang dresses are not made to order, you are approximated by a size chart and then it comes in and a tailor adjusts it. So its not couture. I was told by Tara that couture usually costs more, which i wouldn't know, all I know is that if you're going to sell something and make the customer perceive something that it is not, that is a deceitful and unethical practice.My dress price increased %20 from its original price tag, due to alterations, because basically they ordered a size that was so small for my chest, the bust had to be enlarged and because of my height, I am told I can only wear a 4 inch heel. I cannot accept paying that much money to be told I cannot wear higher than a 4 inch heel. Furthermore, if this was a made to order dress like they make everyone think, I would have not had these limitations and problems.So that's the deal, the dresses are beautiful but what you walk out paying is much more than you think, and you are made to believe each dress is for you, which its not really.I would love to share the final price tag of this dress but I will not because honestly feel so stupid that I bought a dress I will wear once for 6 hours and I paid this much. :(",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emm862

Most of the stores we saw were of that type and places that sold t-shirts and the like. My closets are filled with what they were selling! It was interesting but only worth the trip if you have seen everything else - or you are in the market for that kind of merchandise. Once is enough for us!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PJBLTB

20,A bit over rated...,"Headed for Melrose Ave expecting a similar vibe to Robertson Blvd, however personally thought Melrose was over rated.Shops range from Hot Topic goth style shops, over the top blingtastic style chavvy shops, to cheap tat shops.There are however some great little boutiques between, its just such an effort to find one as you have to venture inside every shop to work out if its worthwhile!Most of the boutiques i did find were quite overpriced for what they had, and all had pictures of Paris Hilton et al claiming they shopped there. Dont know whether thats true or not but couldnt really care either way.One boutique i do recommend is Pasage, where i bought a nice LBD for a reasonable price and the assistants were helpful and friendly, not paranoid that you're gonna shoplift like i noticed in some other shops!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zulucherry

40,Melrose: Look at Me Now,"Melrose Avenue, a place to see and be seen. Long before the t.v. show ever had a start, the name 'Melrose' already had its own claim to fame. Melrose avenue is filled with unique shops, tourists, metal-studded purple-haired punks, and the rich and the famous. Every time a head is turned another shop of attraction becomes the eye-candy. Stores, stores, and more stores plus unique style and intriging crowd equals Melrose shopping, land of glitz glamor and money well spent. If anyone is looking for a good time send them to melrose.
