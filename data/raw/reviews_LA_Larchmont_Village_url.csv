50,Phenomenal experience I recommend for everyone,This Museum was outstanding in every way. The outside views overlooking Los Angeles were amazing. The physical buildings themselves were architectural a terrific and the Landscaping done outside of the museum was beautiful. The monorail system to get you from the parking area to the museum was very well run and got you there in minimal time. The artwork was very impressive and displayed beautifully throughout the museum. Parking cost $20 but there is no cost of admission into the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kjaz43
30,day trip,It's very small. One short main street. Can see why you would want to live near there. Close to The Grove. Just walked around. Literally took 30 minutes. Some nice shops and restaurants.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimowen101
40,A little taste of riches....,"Larchmont Village is located east of LaBrea, between Beverly Blvd and 3rd street. It is a very hip little strip, surrounded by what, at a time, the most expensive neiborhood of Los Angeles. You have to try #Madre's tacos; they are the best tacos in L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreComtois

40,Very interesting little village hidden in Los Angeles,Larchmont Village is a very interesting shopping area north of the mid-Wilshire area. It has a surprising number of restaurants and bakeries that are not chain restaurants. They all have some quaint and unique character and style. There are also some boutique stores that set this neighborhood apart from other areas. Definitely a nice place to have a different experience for dining or shopping. Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,Archetypal LA small independent High Street in Midcity LA,"Spent a few hours here with my LA resident daughter- it's one of her favourites places to go.Small high street , metre parking on street.

40,"Quaint small-ish street in LA - shops, eating places, and weekly/occasional events","Larchmont isn't really a Village, it's a street (just of Beverly Blvd 90036), where you can find a variety of good, interesting shops, including a regular Rite Aid if necessary, plenty of good places to eat, also a Starbucks and also some health joints. A great one is Erin Bakery for those that don't eat gluten, dairy, nuts (and perhaps soy?). You can sit down there for i.e. for coffee and choose from a wide selection of their home made delights.There's a weekly -Sunday Farmers' Market in the mornings. At other times they may have other interesting things going on down there. In October they had an event for kids. It was great; with petting zoo's, slides, activities - the place was so alive - haven't seen so many kids together like that enjoying themselves in ages.Park either on Larchmont if you can on a meter, or in one of the few parking lots. If not, drive around the nearby blocks in the residential areas to park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shoshanah546
50,LA's great secret,"I love LarchmontI've lived in Los Angeles for the past 15 years, and this is a great, relatively unknown gem.Relatively quiet (by LA standards), with some nice shops and restaurants along Larchmont Boulevard (and a great view of the Hollywood sign).Walk Larchmont Boulevard, then take a little walk thru the neighboring Hancock Park neighborhood--beautiful homes without the Beverly Hills attitude. A real treatVery highly recommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JonathanV817
50,Love Larchmont,"I love Larchmont. It has cool shops and it is very pleasant to walk around the neighborhood. I like to walk from K-Town to Larchmont, enjoying the beautiful houses and the peace, which is not present in K-Town. When I walk through the neighborhood, I hear less sirens, less honking. Plus, the neighborhood is really safe and clean. I often walk around at night and it is perfectly fine. After I arrive at the village, I usually get coffee from Bungalow or Go Get em Tiger. If the day is hot, I eat ice cream from Salt and Straw. Sometimes I come with my friend to eat dinner. There are many restaurants but I like the pizzas. After dinner, it is really nice to walk around. Larchmont village is really lovely and a hidden gem in the midst of chaos in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pureumk
50,An idyllic village in a charming LA neighborhood,"Larchmont Village is as adorable as an MGM movie set. It borders Hancock Park, one of the most beautiful of the old Hollywood neighborhoods--20s and 30s houses, tall palm trees, and iconic studios from the 20s and 30s--like Paramount. The ""Village"" is blocks and blocks of attractive shops, boutiques, bookstores, restaurants (try The Larchmont, Vernetti, Osteria Momma, Le Petit Greek), and on Sunday a marvelous Farmers Market. You can buy a manicure, a yoga class, a cappucino, hand-knitted baby sweaters and Italian truffles. And you can do it by walking too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q7536KJmichaelm

The homes around the area and you feel like you are not in the middle of LA. Parking can be a bit challenging on the weekends or depending on the time of day. You will love to just relax, walk around, and grab a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MistyK_12
50,People watch; a real neighborhood,Shops all seem to have a unique blend of items; not found many other places. Eateries spill out onto the sidewalks.

Go hungry and sample the many offered small bites of products - everything from peach slices to humus samples. The variety of vegetables and fruits boggles the mind - Californai is such a big farm for everybody.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NH_Joe
50,Sundays at the Larchmont Village Farmers Market from 10:00a.m.-2p.m.,"I drive 45 minutes from the end of Los Angeles County several times to make this market in the summer. Though quaint, and not the cheapest, it is hands down the PRIMO MARKET for fresh organic produce in the Los Angeles Area! In addition, the array of vendors is simply wonderful and I am never disappointed with my purchases in returning home. Unlike other Famers Markets with the rotten berries and soft tomatoes hidden underneath which is so frustrating. Everything, from top to bottom is fresh and yummy!! I am dreaming of eating a plump sweet peach as I write this and yes there is free parking next to Rite-Aid an entire structure of multi-levels! Besides the amazing produce which is so fresh, fragrant and beautifully grown locally and I do have vendor favorites to share with you. The ladies of BLISS SOAP COMPANY, you can smell their bath bombs, soaps and custom lotions, salts and oils on the opposite side of the market. The bath bombs make excellent gifts and the soaps are a lovely treat for you! Every scent is special! The spice girls selling for a buck hefty bunches of fresh rosemary, Thai basil, thyme, cilantro and more for your culinary and medicinal needs. The guy with the Gourmet oils and vinegars. There is a bee keeper that sells herbal honey, pollen sticks and bee products. Nicolas farms is always a hit with their stand.Also the strawberry lemonade stand and the flowers are lovely including orchids, tiger lilies, and glads. The lavender guy sells plants, sachet and everything lavender. Unique coffee blends,teas,artisan breads, cheeses and french pastries are included in the broad range of vendors. I hear there is even a seafood area which I will check out on my upcoming trip. Jewelry, hand knitted items, arts and crafts vendors are also present. On the way home, after a morning of shopping, I make a pit stop at SAM's BAGEL SHOP. Visitors from Europe will love this market when in Los Angeles. BTW bike riders stop in to refresh, everyone is smiling but leave pooches at home and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NormaR135
50,Great neighborhood main street for shopping and dining,"I stayed nearby at the Hollywood Historic Hotel and frequented Larchmont Village everyday for breakfast, lunch, drug store, bank, or video store.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZExplorer2010
