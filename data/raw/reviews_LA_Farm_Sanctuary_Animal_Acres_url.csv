50,A place dedicated to farm animals,"I had a delightful experience at this animal sanctuary. The staff are lovely people who care about the welfare of the animals of the facility.The first part of the tour is an overview about how the industries that utilize animals (cows, chickens, etc) operate.The majority of the tour consisted of walking through the various enclosures to see the cows, pigs, goats, sheep and other animals.

50,Peaceful paradise,"Walk among the rescued farm animals...cattle, horses, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, and a llama... each has a name and a history that brought him or her to this lovely mountain paradise where they each receive lifetime loving care and medical treatments as needed. Learn much about the demise of mainstream animals and about what YOU can do to change it. Tours are given on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. This is my favorite place on earth, where animals are at peace and allowed to be themselves. Worth every minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/piperann3

40,Great for animal lovers,"If you are an animal lover, you will enjoy this. It's an easy 1 hour drive from L.A on open roads. The tour goes for an hour and is very informative and educational. You get to pat the animals and hear about each of their stories. They have a gift shop that has some snacks but no food so either bring your own (there are areas to sit after the tour) or go elsewhere. Staff are very friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarinaB556
50,FEEDING OF TURKEYS,"My girlfriend took me to an annual ritual of the feeding of the turkeys.Instead of feeding on turkeys, we fed the turkeys.I really enjoyed myself, and I won a bidding war for a painting of turkeys gathering in the snow. It has a nice frame and very nice artwork. We met other farm animals as well, which included cows, pigs and goats.You can't just go visit on a whim....you have to visit their website for hours and events.If you get the chance, it's a good day to look at alternatives to a meat eater lifestyle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArmchairC
