50,Breathtaking trail and scenery,"Amazing trail along the ocean with spectacular views. There are warnings about rattle snakes, but the actual trail is scenic and historic.",Glamourlife
40,Great park and walking trail,"This park is family and pet friendly, lots nice wild flowers to discover and take close up photos. There is a gate preventing vihecles to enter, but it allows people to walk in and follow the trail. We did not walk very far because of hot weather. Friends told us the trail can lead to as fast as Long Beach.",cjean168
50,Greatest hiking area around,"This is the best place to hike or ride your mountain bike, views are awesome and Google even has the trails on the maps. Go all the way to bottom and see the ocean views too.",Reza S
50,One of my favorite places to hike,Whenever a new friend wants to check out an awesome view of California. This is my favorite place to take them. They never forget it!,starrybeachlr
40,Great trekking,A great option for anyone who wants to do a physical activity outside the most touristic and crowded areas. Our 5 years old made it and it was great for the whole family.,Magnus Ã…
30,View of rocket launches?,"I went here because I read it was a good place to view a SpaceX launch from L.A., and I didn't have time to drive up to Vandenberg. For a daytime launch, I could see the contrail, but it was very short and didn't streak all the way across the sky. It really is too far away to recommend going there for a launch unless you have high powered binoculars or a telescope. It might be good for a night time launch with clear skies. The park itself is pretty much a big patch of grass leading up to an overlook of the ocean. The parking lot is small, but there is additional parking on the street. There is also a fairly long trail to the beach which I didn't take because it was like a 100 degrees out.",Brbnkseaj
50,Beautiful Views,"The location is great, not too busy and the views are beautiful! Be sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen!",LizbethW14
50,Best Ocean View Hiking,"These views rival any hiking trail in Malibu or Santa Monica. The ocean views from the tops of Del Cerro Park and the numerous trails down the hillside are breathtakingly beautiful. Especially since California had a wet winter, the cascades of wild flowers are particularly delightful this year. Normally the vegetation isn't as lush so if you can see it soon.WARNING: all the extra wild sage and fields of grasses have made the area a utopia to the local wildlife. I have now seen a big rattle snake and a coyote. The rattle snake was curled in the greenery just to the side of one of the wider paths. I have since been avoiding the super overgrown paths.ALSO PARKING: really the parking situation is a mess. The tiny parking lot in the park just doesn't accommodate the popularity of this place on Sat & Sun. Also you have to be very careful with parking along the street to get to the park. Certain sections require a day parking permit (which is ridiculous) they look like normal spots but you will get a ticket, especially in the morning hours. And likewise parking on the neighborhood is extremely risky and can also get you a ticket. Park with care.",LA Art Advisor
50,Fantastic view of Catalina,Like everyone says. Parking is very limited. You might need to ride around for 5 minutes to find a open parking space. Once you get a space and go to the overview. You see one of the most beautiful views anywhere. There are numerous trails. The one by the roadside parking called rattlesnake trail is very elderly unfriendly. Only use it if you are fit or young. But there are others but all are quite steep.Wear appropriate shoes.,Joyce and Dean
50,Hikes with views,This location has tons of trails to choose from with awesome views of the ocean. Please bring some water and a positive attitude you'll enjoy the hike a lot more.Looking forward to my return,Peter M
40,Nice View with Nice Cardio,"Del Cerro park has lots of hiking opportunities.. I go to few of my favorites..On Lazy days I hike on Burma Road as much as I want to go, this one is fire road ( I think, looks like one), go as much as I want first it goes gradually down.. One has to come back up! At the end of the trail, there is a board says some information.. one can continue with another trail which goes all the way down to Ocean! Never tried that one.. one day I will do that. There are few short cuts to come back where you started from via Eagle Nest or Peacock Flat ( it is not Flat! coming back up)Ishibashi trail trail will be on your left after restroom on Burma Road, it is a a bit harder to come back, it meets Burma road too.Rattlesnake Trails starts before the park entrance, I use this one and Ishibashi ( not together) one of those days when I want more exercise or feel fit..There are also many other trails coming to Burma road and goes many ways, 4 to 6 miles hike when it ends up in a neighborhood nearby.There are no water anywhere on trails, only restroom is close entrance on Burma road, it gets really really hot before you know it. Don't get southern Ca weather fool you.Very rewardings views throughout the hike, many trails to explore.. I just named my favorites..",keks64
40,Nice Hike with Gorgeous Views - PARKING ALERT,"We're not hikers but we decided to give it a try since it's not too far from our house.Parking is the trick. There's a parking lot, but it's often full. You can park on the street leading up to the park BUT the ten or so spaces closest to the park are PERMIT ONLY. The signs at the start and finish of this string of parking spaces are tiny and the ticket is $65. There are more spaces farther from the park, though, so use those if there are none in the lot.The trails start at the top of the hill and go for a few miles down hill. They're well marked and easily negotiated. The challenge is the length and elevation change. There are no streams that we could see. The view is of the beautiful Pacific and Catalina Island (and maybe others - it was hazy when we were there). Take plenty of water. We're in our 60s and didn't have a lot of trouble with it. Dogs are allowed on leashes and bikes are allowed on the larger trails.",tomslyck
30,"Limited parking, limited opportunityt",Once there was ample parking. In response to nearby neighbors it has become extremely restricted.Be prepared to be disappointed. Trails and views are great. But only if you can find parking,Jerry H
50,Great views,This place has amazing views! The park is on top of the peninsula so you can overlook the ocean. There are hiking trails and biking trails as well that leave from the sides of the small park and view area. Great area to bring people from out of town.,Dream559413
50,Best P.V. views,"There are some spectacular viewpoints along the P.V. coast but this one is the best. You can walk down trails, or mountain bike or just come for the view and hang out in the park on top",S. M
50,Great Quiet View,"Everytime i come Back Home , this is my Place , absolutely Breath Taking , Just Breathe the Fresh Salt water , and of course the Great Hike which u can get a Good Workout i would recommend Some Great Hiking Shoes since it is a Great long stretch but so worth it Be Prepared with some Water as well ..",PatriciaM1975
30,Great place to hike nearby,"Great location overlooking ocean. However, it is basically a place to sit and overlook the ocean. There are no picnic tables, no public bathrooms, and no play equipment for the kids. The park borders local residences, and I suspect that is why there is no access to public facilities. However, Del Cerro Park is close to the PV Land Conservancy hiking/trail area. Now that is the place to visit if you wish to have access to great hiking trails overlooking the ocean.",Bgoodtoall
40,A small quiet place,"I should tell you to stay away from this park and the only reason I could give is that I do not want it to become crowded. I enjoy this special little park.. In a quiet neighborhood a fair size green grass area with room for children and dogs to run. There are no bathrooms, playground equipment,or benches and tables, however, walk up the short path on the far right and you will be treated to a gorgeous view of the Calif. coast. There two beneches to sit on up there and that is it. Small, beautiful, and a lovely place to breath in cool clean ocean air.",Diane H
50,nice nice nice view...,"this is so far my best place since it is on my back yard.lol..not really but it is minutes from my apt... I like to go there and see the whole 180 degrees view...perfect for morning, sunset and shooting stars......and if you have time...go on the trials......nice place to walk and do sports......please pick up trash if you see any out there..lately some folks are visiting this place but are out the town and I have seen couple of them doing this.....and also, be careful after dark time....last time,my friends and we were there watching shooting stars and couples where there doing not good things...????,,, FYI..... other than that...NICE PLACE!!!",Mardi777
50,EXQUISITE VIEWS!,"I am within walking distance of Del Cerro Park, so it is a frequent walking destination for me and my wife. While it is nearly 1200' above sea level, it provides panoramic views of Catalina Islands, Catalina Channel, and additional views toward San Pedro (Coastline) to the East and the Pacific Ocean to the West. On really clear days, one can see Santa Barbara ISLAND (~35 miles away) as well as on REALLY Clear days, San Nicolas Island (~70 miles away) right in line with Santa Barbara Island! The peace and serenity of the place make it most desirable for picnics, families, etc... It is quite a jewel with breathtaking views of the South side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, including Portuguese Bend, Abalone Cove, Trump International Golf Course, and the Terrenea (five star) Resort! Quite an enjoyable place to visit. Be sure to bring Binoculars to enjoy it to the fullest.",PVJOE
50,We hike the trails starting there a lot,There are about 30 miles of trails in Palos Verdes. Del Cerro park is at the trailhead of the most traveled trail.It can get hot and parts of it are difficult. Bring water. Watch for snakes and bikers.,Dan G
40,Enjoy the view or sit and meditate,"This park is a wonderful place to watch the sun set, enjoy the view of Catalina or just sit and meditate.",Paul L
40,Hiking place.,A great start to start a 2 mile loop or longer that takes you into north america's biggest active landslide.,Jeff C
50,Standing With the Clouds,"Del Cerro Park in Rancho Palos Verdes is a hidden gem that is not to be missed. I get to Del Cerro Park by driving SOUTH on Crenshaw Blvd until the street literally ends near the park. This recreational playground offers a wide, flat, and green grassy area to enjoy. That area turns into a steep grassy hill which is both a challenge and fun to climb. At the top of the hill, I stood so high up that I felt that I was standing with the clouds. Below, there was a far-reaching, breathtaking, and memorable view of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island which defies description. What a great day to have my head in the clouds!",Ms T B
