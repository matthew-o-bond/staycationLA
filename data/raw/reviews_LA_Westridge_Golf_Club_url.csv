20,Drought Victim,"The greens are very damaged by fungus. Very poor putting service. The fairways are also very ragged with washouts throughout. The bunkers have very little sand, obviously washed out by the recent rains. It is quickly apparent by it's lack of maintenance that it is a golf course in decline and probably the worst in the area. My recommendation is don't spend your time or money here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donalddN2842YF
40,Nice course,This is a good neighborhood course. We can take our time and have fun with our friends. We always enjoy going there and visit about once a month.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kaj20
40,Lovely Wedding Reception venue,"Earlier this summer, I attended a wedding reception at this location.We were served pre dinner snacks and champagne on the patio area and then entered the dinning room.The room had a light and airy feel to it while maintaining the look of a formal occasion.The servers were very polite and helpful and the room did not have a crowded feel even though many were there celebrating. I would reccomend it for a reception.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hapi2014
30,"Ok golf course, but good bang for buck on Mondays","Frist of all, I am rating this for golf, so that is clear. Not dining or hanging out at bar. I am an avid golfer, struggling like everyone else to keep my handicap ( I am a 15). I have played Westridge many times. It is a decent course for the money, and I will review with bullet points of good and bad, which are easier to digest and gets to the point:Pros:1. Go Mondays. Super cheap and a good deal ($39 with cart)2. Greens are pretty good. A little slow, but not bad.3. Some nice hole layouts, raised tee-boxes, fairly good mix of styles. Not just an open course with fairway next to fairway.Cons:1. They pack 'em in, so expect a 5 hour round (which is why I joined a private club)2. Fairways can be a bit sparse of grass in spots3. Demograph is a specific ethnic origin, who tend to play slow, and NEVER fix divots. That really grates on me........I am always fixing divots from others on front of me because I respect the game and the course.4. Tee boxes ok, but could be mowed closer and leveled better.All in all, if you have the time, play Monday and enjoy the course. It is really not a bad course at all. Oh, and on 18 no point in using driver unless you hit 300+. You will need to lay up on your second shot likely.......",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dben99
30,Front 9 is nice but the back 9 was in poor condition!,I would rate the front 9 a very good rating but the back nine was poor giving this an overall rating of average. The course is challenging and overall had a good time. The employees were nice but the play was slow.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kobesan2000
40,Course is in great shape!,"New management has taken over and course is in great shape! Almost would give 5 stars, but it sometimes get slow play. Look online for a deal, rather than paying pro shop rate. It's a great course with the most ""testy"" greens in the area. Lots of undulation. Definitely recommend! I'll be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricLAX
50,Beautiful Country Club,I have been there several times for a special Christmas lunch for many years. The food is VERY good and the hospitality very nice. I'm sure for special occasions it would fit into all your plans.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Grandmaleslie
40,"A Good Course even for High Handicappers, enjoy!!","I am visiting LA and my friend took me there for a round of golf in the morning. Been playing in Hong Kong KSC for the past years, driving a golf cart on to the field is a big treat, There are only a couple of water hazards and over the valley shots so a good player could easily play the same ball all the way. But that would be too boring for me, so i lost two balls - a record for me too, getting used to lose 10+ balls when playing at KSC-north. I barely made a double digit score without going to my usual triple digit score. so for me if i can score below 100, the course would be good for high handicappers, considering that my usual score at KSC -North is consistently 100+ or even 110+, pathetic, isn't it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Uncle_Vin
30,Golf,I was a member of the Yorba Linda CC and a member of the mens club. We played them once and I really don't recall much about it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rodagain
20,Going downhill fast.,"This place is changing rapidly, and not for the better. The beverage cart gals are no longer there. A maintenance worker removed the pin flags from the holes with a half hour of daylight remaining. We stopped playing when we did not know where to shoot at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tony32580
50,"Tough course, but great place to play with friends.","I enjoyed the course, but would say you need to play before 12:13 in order to get your entire game in. Can play slow especially if you have a group in front of you like we did that must have been playing for a lot of money since they looked at every putt as if the Master's championship was on the line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dmas6
