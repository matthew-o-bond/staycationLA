50,Great job and customer service!,I found a nail place on the way to the airport. I had never been there before period I thought I had 5 hours to kill before my trip from LAX. I booked an appointment in got their 1/2 hour late due to heavy traffic. They still saw me with a smile. They were very attentive and did a great job on my nails. At 1 point when I said I was running a little bit late they triple teamed me in all of a sudden my nails were done in no time! They did a beautiful job. I'm also a bit of a germ a phobe and love the fact that they sterilize all their instruments.,lynnielein
