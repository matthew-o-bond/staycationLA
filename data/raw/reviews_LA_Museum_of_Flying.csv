50,"Amazing little good value museum, i love it","I was on holiday in this area and saw the sign for it. Being from England i wasn't aware of this attraction. I was so pleased me and my girlfriend decided to follow the signs as it was Amazing. There's something for everyone, Models to look at, Actual planes, Seats to sit in an actual cockpit with controls, The photos are fascinating. I was also very impressed by the Museum person who was so very interesting telling me about the place, planes even the history behind the round table and office furniture. I recommend this attraction to all in this area.",DerbyPhilip
50,wonderful aviation museum at Santa Monica airport,"If you are interested in airplanes, airplane memorabilia and the aviation history of southern CA, specifically McDonnel Douglas, this is the museum for you. It is small and well curated. Airplanes hanging from the ceiling, amazing murals and Mr. Douglas's actual conference room table. Great for kids. You can also rent the space for events. Friendly staff and volunteers. After your visit, go have a burger at Spitfire Grill half a block away.",roadtrippersCDL
50,We all had a fantastic time,"We went my wife, 2 granddaughters age 10 and 11 and had a great time. Even though is small it has great things to see. We loved a movie they have about the history of planes in the US. They also have a fantastic simulator that the kids can fly. The staff is superb and knowledgeable. We will be back.",Jose S
50,very cool small museum,"lots of history in the Santa Monica area and Los Angeles in general, Douglas aircraft info, great hands on for the kids, too.",ferdferd
50,Great spot for events!,"Came here for a cocktail reception! Loved the authentic, cool environment. Lots of fun socializing in this setting! Very convenient with lots of parking.Fun time!",travelchamp1
40,"Fun museum, especially for airplane afficianados","The Museum of Flying is a great small museum, especially for anyone interested in the history of flying and also for children. There are numerous historical aircraft on display, along with many models and photographs. Several cockpits can be entered and sat in, and there are very knowledgeable docents to answer any question about the aircraft on display. Located in the Santa Monica Airport, the museum also covers the history of the airport as well as Douglas Aircraft, which started their business in that location. I found a full scale model of the Wright Brothers first flying airplane especially compelling. It was donated to the museum by 20th Century Fox, and had been used as a prop in the film ""Night at the Museum"".",Edward S
40,Great place to take your kids or grandkids,"We visited with our 3 grandkids. They have docents positioned around the museum to help explain the planes. There are a couple of cockpits they can climb into and pretend to fly the plane. They also had a scavenger hunt for the kids, and they each got a prize (a cardboard plane to build). Afterwards, we drove over to the observation deck at Santa Monica airport and watched several take-offs and landings. One of the docents told us about going to the observation deck. They were all so friendly and helpful. The flight simulator was not working, but only one of the three are over 48"" tall, so it was probably good that it wasn't working :)",Sheila Z
30,Interesting stop,"While you are on the west side near the beach, stop by the Museum of Flying at the Santa Monica airport. It offers some interesting information and displays about flight history in the U.S.",buffalojim67

50,A fun stop for our family,"My kids enjoyed the hands on aspect of the museum and though we did not do the flight simulator, it looked fun! Our favorite part was watching the planes take off and land from the observation deck at the airport.",AndreaMSU
50,Small but fun,This museum is located at the Santa Mnica's landmark airport. It's small with fairly large collection of small planes and even a cockpit of a jet plane that one can sit in. Some memorabilia and a bit of written history on display makes it interesting. Very much fun for kids and adults alike.,GOSIA P
40,Lovely afternoon,We met friends and their kids ages 4-13 for what turned into a perfect afternoon. The museum is small but delightful. The docents were all happy to be there and share their interesting knowledge. All the kids were engaged be it the hands on controls to sitting in old airplane seats to watch a video clip. We will definitely come again. Afterwards we walked over to the observation deck to watch the planes land and ended with the kids playing at the playground a block away. It was a lovely way to spend the afternoon.,robnstu
50,Small but very interesting and educational,"Very friendly and helpful staff, interesting and educational. We were impressed by the history of Douglas, didn't realize what we had in our very backyard. My 12 yo son really liked that they had training and real cockpits you can sit in. We also really liked the replica of the Wright Brother's first airplane, which was featured in Night At The Museum. Be sure to visit the flight deck at the Santa Monica airport, walking distance away, to watch airplanes take off and land in front of you (while listening to the tower communications, real time).",Al M
50,If you love planes and flying it is a must,"My son, Hamilton and I visited your wonderful Museum of Flying yesterday and i needed to write to say thank you. We had a fantastic time and wish to thank all your people who we talked with and who showed us around that they made it a very special visit - the 727, the board room, the planes and the simulator (727 and roller-coaster). ALL up impressive and made extra special by your fantastically knowledgeable, friendly and interested team!If you love planes and flying it is a must",Niall C
50,"If you love aviation, stop by the museum",A nice place for families and folks who love flying. This is located on the same small airport property that used to be home to McDonald Douglas Aircraft.,Alice D
30,Little diappointed,"Recently visited the museum with my family and 7 year old son . It was very short stay less then hour and except of one employee other were a bit rude and very opinitated about children being able to learn and satisfy there imagniation but can be exciting for younger kids.There are few planes and a live rescue truck which my son was able to from inside because of a very helpful employee.Other then that nothing really exciting to see.I used Groupon coupon which was a good deal , otherwise price is too much for what they have to offer.",r S
50,A small but very interesting place,I had never heard of this museum but I am glad I saw it in a tour book. There are a great selection of displays particularly highlighting the history of the Douglas Aircraft Corporation.,flyboy1946
40,GOOD AIRCRAFT MUSEUM AT SANTA MONICA AIRPORT,The Museum of Flying is located at the entrance to the Santa Monica Airport. There are lots of vintage airplanes on display inside and outside including the old workhorse DC-3. The airplanes all have good information plaques explaining when they were in service. There is even a cockpit from a Boeing 727 that you can sit in. Also there is a flight simulator that you can try out for additional cost.,DarylJ552

50,Nice little place for a quick family visit!,"Not a huge place, has a 20-25 place parking lot with a small park outside, but a great small historical place to show your kids a little bit of important history! My pre-teen & teenager enjoyed the exhibits and learning. We even got a self-appointed docent for a little while, which was interesting.",Deborah P
50,beautiful planes and really nice staff,"You have a diversity of beautiful planes, you can sit in two diferent cockpits and you can enjoy a flight simulator. It's a small cute museum you can enjoy with your family.",Jo F
50,Great historical view of aviation,"Even if you aren't interested in history, you will find something of interest in this museum. The planes are very interesting to look at and the formation of the city around this industry is amazing to see. I found it very informative and the staff very helpful. The best part is the parking is FREE!",sixxmom
40,Interesting for Kids and Fam's,I have never gone here but was pleasantly surprised! The virtual pilot rides are astounding! Parking easy!,MLondon26
50,Fun and informative!!,"Awesome ! Free parking, the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend the flight simulator just an extra $8 pp",Curlychic1986
30,For airplane enthusiasts,A small museum that has unique planes and some local history.Check this out if you love planes. It's local history.,SMOgal
50,Simulator is fabulous. So is the rest of the museum,"Tucked away in the easy to pass (but easy to find) Santa Monica Airport is a great, small Museum of Flying. Fees are modest, and adults and children can spend several happy hours without repeating activities---except for the flight simulator. As to the latter, anaddiction is easily possible. My 14 year old grandson became addicted, providing a cover for my own addiction. The AIrport itself is active, so outdoor viewing of jets and props is also included at no extra charge.",Cos39
50,Small but fascinating,This was a great inexpensive afternoon out. Not the largest aviation museum but extremely interesting. The photographs and the history of Douglas Aviation and the surrounding Santa Monica area was mesmerizing and inspirational. Definitely worth going back.,TomMacrae
20,Don't bother...,"Small and disappointingTakes maybe 15-20 minutes to see it all—if you go slow and take your time!Only about a dozen or so planes, parts of planes and scale modelsOverpriced with a $10 admissionNot enough to be a museumNot hands-on and interactive enough to be an attractionGo to an end of the runway and watch small private planes take-off/landNo No",Summerasalifestyle
40,Small Aviation museum with some neat exhibits,"Stopped here after seeing the museum on a groupon offer. It is a rather small museum, but some nice hands on airplanes for children, and big children :)The Fedex 727 cockpit was really cool and allows you full access. It's well worth a visit with children or if you are an aviation enthusiast.",Jamie B
50,Great Museum in the heart of Douglas country,"Despite the tricky location, this museum is well worth the visit in a place that has seen a lot of the Douglas Aviation History at the Santa Monica museumNice collection with a wright flyer replica to the model of the proposed Douglas SST transport. The nose section of the FedEx 727 with accessible cockpit is a favorite with the children.The Museum also feature some great artwork by local Aviation artist with Worldwide fame : Mike Machat",jean louis D
50,Overlooked History,"The Museum of Flying is tucked between Sanata Monica College and the Santa Monica Airport. Now in its second incation (the original was the Douglas Museum and Library), the Museum of Flying augments the usual Wright flyer and other vintage aircraft with artifacts fromt the life of Donald Douglas, one of the unsung heroes of aviation. You can see his desk and drafting table, review his plans, and see how the entire Douglas aircraft factory complex was camoflaged under netting to keep it safe from possible air attack by Japan. There is also substantial matierial on another local aviation great, Howard Hughes. With its focus on the South Los Angeles Aviation heritage, there is much that you will not find in other museums. Not Air and Space, not the AF museum, not Pima,nowhere else can you see major sections of this collection. There are audiovisual exibits in addition to the display of artifacts. Due to financial pressure the current facility only exhibits 10% of its entire collection. Hopefully, funding will become available to expand their one of a kind materials. It is a shame that an important part of our aviation history is not available to researchers and just plain aviation buffs.",ColConnie
40,My Kid Loved All Of The Airplanes,I take my 3 year old over to Santa Monica Airpark and we watch the jets take off every once and a while. The observation deck is compelling and cheap.On the same campus is the Museum of Flying which is loaded with cool planes and aviation technology. My kid loved it. Its not a long stay but that's cool because my kid is 3.They do have a pretty well stocked toy/gift shop. My kid didn't miss that.,FlyersFanInLA
50,Hidden Flying Jewel in SM ....,"A treasure trove Museum of aircraft and historical memorabilia - located at Santa Monica Airport. Historically significant is the word here, as the SM field location was the site of Douglas Aircraft of WWII, and after, fame. Has food in a charming setting. You'll enjoy...",David B L
40,Enchanted,"This local museum is a charming blast to the past with a self guided tour. You can leisurely stroll throughout the museum and get up close to several of the classic planes. You can even climb aboard one of the display planes and pretend to be a pilot or co-pilot. I was impressed by the written documentation and photo collection noted for women pilots throughout history. Well done for a small space. I took my father who also loves planes, so it was a great way to spend a couple of hours with him. I don't remember a cafe on site, restrooms are available. There are many local restaurants right on Ocean Park Blvd. if you want to eat before or after your visit.",Laura K
30,If you love planes or your grandpa does...,"A nice local museum with several dozen planes and lots of detailed information about them. Particularly interesting to plane lovers. Great for families as Grandpa can read about the history and kids can run around. Best part was the volunteer guide at the 727 cockpit, who explained to us how to pilot a take off and landing as we sat at the controls. You can flip the switches, nothing actually happens, but with the volunteer's explanation and seeing the hundreds of controls that pilots have to deal with, you get an appreciation for how hard it is (at least before computers). Some planes outside you can see for free. Also interesting how Santa Monica was the home to the important aviation company Douglas Aircraft which designed key planes for WWII and commercial airlines. I wish there was a bit more storyline, but there is plenty of dates and engineering specifics for aviation and military fans.",socali123
50,Small but nice museum to learn about the history of flight,"Visited this museum back in March of 2013, it was really nice to finally see it after many years.It provides a great learning experience for children as well as adults from a model of the Wright flyer, hands on exhibits of actual cockpits of an older aircraft, a vintage fighter and a commercial airline cockpit for kids/adults to get their hands on behind the controls.It's not a bad way to spend a few hours if you're in Santa Monica.",GhostRider17959
50,"If you love planes & stepping back into time, this is the place for you!","Was in town for business and seeing as the hubby loves planes, planned a quick stop here. That quick trip themed u to several hours! Let me just say that the director Dan is AMAZING! It almost felt like we had a personal private guided tour. His knowledge about planes, pilots, bygone eras, engineering was top notch! He explained everything in an interesting & charismatic way that turned me into a plane buff as well. In addition, being able to sit in an actual cockpit, get the chance for a beautiful piece of artwork customized to show the plane of your liking, the array of planes from the wright brothers onward, etc was a great experience. If you're ever in the area, take some time & head on over...you'll love it!",jkbim
40,A small but neat museum full with interesting artifacts.,"I was there outside of museum hours because my company was having a reception inside, so I did not pay, but I think regular fee is $10. I had no idea we had a museum of flying in Santa Monica until that day. It's a very neat small museum full with artifacts about Douglas Aircraft Company, including a cockpit of Boing 727. I spent good amount of time in the cockpit because it was very interesting. They also have planes from different eras, including WWII. I was also very interested in seeing how stewardess uniforms changed in time, they had good number of mannequins. I also sat at a boing 747 seat and watched a documentary about flying. Overall, it worth a visit during a weekend with your family. They have good number of interesting stuff about flying.",Mert51
30,wheelchair access,This place is totally wheelchair accessible. However the lift wasn’t working the day we came so we got in for free and also got two free tickets to come back again It is quite small though.,twocalis
50,nice easy to manage museum,"perfect in town museum that takes a half hour to see. located right on the edge of santa monica airport, easy parking and walking distance from a couple nice restaurants.",pandpCalifornia
50,Excellent Museum - Great Docents,"On a whim, my younger son and I decided to visit the Museum of Flying in July, 2014 and I am really glad we stopped in.The museum is small - you can cover it in a two to three hours, depending upon how much time you spend talking to the docents. The exhibits are generally well maintained and the docents really like talking to children about flying. My son and I spent about two hours there checking out the exhibits, climbing into some of the open cockpits (where allowed!) and chatting with the docents. Of course, there is the requisite visit to the gift store which is well stocked with airplane ""stuff"".I spent a good bit of time talking with the docents who were all retired military and/or civilian pilots. Since my Father is a retired airline pilot and former SAC pilot we found a lot to chat about!A few notes for your visit:1. Allot at least an hour and make sure to bring a camera. They have static exhibits outside by the parking lot as well as inside.2. As mentioned, take your time and talk with the docents. They're a wealth of information and stories.3. Restroom facilities are clean.4. Parking can be a bit of a trick as it's a small lot. We arrived around 10:30 AM and found a place without issue. However, when we left around 12:30 PM the place was at capacity.Overall, this is a well-sized and appointed museum. It's just large enough and has enough exhibits to keep young children interested and not tire them out completely. We really enjoyed it and will visit again. I highly recommend this museum if you're into planes.I would love to bring my Father here but, sadly, he's not able to travel any longer so I sent him a bunch of pictures of the place.",Paul S
50,A thrill for those who love planes,The Museum of Flying is easy to find and to get to by car. It's in Santa Monica close to the airport and also reasonably close to LAX. It's also close to the site where many of the Douglass planes were built. It has a small but interesting collection and is well worth a visit.,Kathy S
30,Flew through the Museum!,"Decided to visit the museum after Groupon offered a discount on tickets. Figured ""Why Not?"" Overall it was an enjoyable experience. You wont need more than an hour to see the entire place. We went on a Saturday afternoon in July and there were maybe 6 other people there as well? The exhibits were ok, but a lot of them were replications and movie props. Cool if you arent in the movie biz i suppose. You do get to sit in a test cockpit and a couple airplane cockpit's, one from a Fed Ex plane. It's fun to push the buttons (even at 34yrs old) and more especially for boys! They feed the Air Traffic Control radio from Santa Monica airport into the Fed Ex cockpit so it's fun to have the ""live"" experience.Be sure to ask the docents for information, we certainly got an education we wouldnt have seen just looking around and reading signage.Good for a non-rush lazy afternoon of doing something light and educational. My boyfriend has never flown commercially, so he got to sit in some real airplane seats they had scattered around the museum. Good for him to see what it will be like soon enough! Be sure to grab a free ""I heart"" sticker on your way out!",jenandallthethings
50,great fun for kids and adults,"I love this place. It has lots of planes for its size. It also has a flight simulator that includes motion as well as visual, so you can feel what it might be like to do a roll, or spin. There is a store that you can purchase small planes and models. Douglas Aircraft was located here and there are many exhibits that document this history.The museum is located on the Santa Monica Airport property which was once Douglas Aircraft Property. There is a nice restaurant within easy walking distance. The museum has several events a year, check their calendar for details.",J S
30,Quite nice but a little small,What was here was very nice but it was much smaller than I expected. The staff were brimming with information and were very helpful. It has a flight simulator for an extra cost with a choice of type of plane. Worth a visit if you are in the area but not worth a long drive to as we did.,Tricia B
40,Fun with kids.,Our son enjoys going here and when he was small liked to watch the take off and landings from the public bleachers up at the airport. I recommend a packing a lunch and making a day of it. There's also a little public park for little ones to run around in.,Love2stayaway

40,A small museum with a well presented collection,"We visited the Museum of Flying yesterday and were pleasantly pleased. The permanent collection is small yet interesting. It includes a replica of the Wright Flyer, and the nose section of a Boeing 727 where one can sit at the controls.The current temporary exhibition is an international traveling exhibition called ""Now Boarding, Fentress Airports + The Architecture of Flight."" It explores the past, present and future of airport design, including the modernized Tom Bradley International Terminal at LAX. now boarding.orgWe thought we would spend an hour or so at the museum, but ended up staying over three hours. There's a small screening room that shows films and documentaries.",Woody
40,Small but full of history and planes,"I live near here and decided to check this out with my husband one day. Its small but full of history and an amazing amount of planes in a small spot. My favorite thing was sitting in the cockpit of the Fed Ex plane, that was cool. My husband is the one much more interested in this sort of thing, so he liked it a lot more than me, but there's enough to keep someone who isn't as interested occupied!",nevinbleau
50,A must see for all ages,Firstly - the address is wrong - it is actually on Airport Ave opposite the entrance to Santa Monica Airport. I took my 5yo son there who loves all things aviation and he loved it. We went on a Thursday and it was very quiet which was great. One of the ladies spent nearly an hour with my son in the cockpit of the nose section there showing him everything and answering all his questions. If you are in the LA area this museum should definitely be on the list of things to do.,MissMinelli
50,Great little museum. Unique.,This is a perfect day trip for a family. It's located at the working Santa Monica Airport and there are picnic tables nearby and a littlle resto called Spitfire Grill and then you can go see the airplanes taking off and landing. The museum was lovingly designed by a contractor who loves to fly and he used part of an old FedEx plane nose and integrated it into the design and you can go inside it! Fun! Kids and adults will be happy with this place that is big enough to have lots of cool stuff but bite sized enough to not be exhausting.,AFoolForTravel
30,small but interesting museum,Visited with grandson and had a very nice time. Compared to other Flying museums this is small and simple. It is however a nice hour or so visit especially with children. The large one at Boeing Field in Seattle is much more encyclopedic but this small local facility is quite satisfying in its class.,Chingachgook

50,Recent visit.,"Very good, still needs some of the exhibits brought over from the other side of the airport, where it was originally housed.

Nevertheless, the variety of types makes it worthwhile to visit. The staff are friendly, with a special note of thanks to the nice lady who looks after the visitors to the Boeing 727 nose section.",Simon P
50,Museum of Flying - Santa Monica Airport,"This is a great museum. It offers just the right mix of military and civilian aircraft and it is not so large that you can get lost in it or that it will take hours to see in its entirety. It has a collection of amazing aircraft both indoors and outdoors that change periodically. Additionally, it has several really exciting interactive exhibits which include being able to sit in the cockpit af a modern jet liner (a great photo op) and for the kids the opportunity to fly a link trainer. It has a great continuous running collection of historical and current films and a striking recreation of Mr. Douglas's office (President of McDonnel Douglas Aircraft). The people are great and they are there to help. Where there is a nominal entrance fee, its one of the few places in LA where parking is free. It is a truly someting not to miss.",Wendy C
