40,Very good cultural find and explanation,"If you think public mural graffiti is solely a modern art form, it has been around Los Angeles for 100 years. For those familiar with Miami, this may have been the original Wynwood. This historic mural was discover on the Side of a building during restoration. This museum both displays the mural and a museum that explains the painting and its cultural significance.Go upstairs for a create view of the resorted mural. Also see the effort made to expose the mural while also protecting it from the elements. It is a great mural.Then return downstairs for an explanation. The painter was a Mexican revolutionary during the rebellions of the early 20th century. The painting has many historic and cultural themes that are well explained. You also get the story of its whitewash.I am no supporter of censorship, but I am also not a support of public art advocating violence. While it is regrettable that it was covered, I don't understand the need to include symbols encouraging open rebellion. In that case I understand the whitewash decision even in disagreement. Still this is a great historic find that causes us to confront some historical conflict in a very well done way. Too bad more people have not visited.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
