50,Griffith Observatory.,"It is a park with an observatory, they explain to you in detail how telescopes work, as well as the movements of the planets, how we understand and visualize the universe. This is also where you get very close to the Hollywood sign. You have to put this on your visit list!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianasmith
50,Lovely park with views,Lovely park with great walks and views. Make sure to find the old zoo where there are still some cages for a glimpse into the past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
40,Dont miss the Trail,"You would never know you are minutes from downtown LA, we stopped at the Trail for a snack as we motored up to the observatory. It's basically a food shack, but we had quiche, cheese sandwich and our son the snakedog...all drinks, chips, and a huge piece of apple pie. We sat out under the roofed seating area and had a lovely picnic surrounded by millions of Angeloes going bout their business in the center of one of the biggest cities in USA...very relaxing and civilized...Not pricey, and a nice way stop on our way to the planetarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VicS906
50,Amazing views,This is a must-do if you are visiting Los Angeles. Up on top of the hill away from the city you can experience the amazing views and the vast valley below. Almost 360 degrees of views. View of the Hollywood sign also.You get a chance to be out in the natural beauty of this part of California and enjoy the great outdoors. You can take a hike or bike on one of the many trails.Public restrooms and running water are available.There is a parking lot at the top where the observatory is located and metered parking on the road side going up the hill.The observatory is free but you may need to pay for parking. It opens about noon on weekdays but the park opens in the morning.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DiFromOhio
50,Great Hike and Amazing views of the area,"Griffith Park is a must when visiting LA. Hollywood Peak is a fantastic hike and a great spot to view Los Angeles and surrounding area. The hike is not too challenging, although there are few people making some rest spots. Wear comfortable hiking footwear with some treads. Folks with normal sneakers where slipping and sliding a little. The Views from Hollywood peak are great. you have a 360 degree view of the area. Downtown LA, Hollywood, Santa Monica, the pacific ocean on one side, and Burbank, Pasadena and Angeles National Forrest on the other. The Hollywood sign is just in the distance and lots of great spots for photos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Indah2014
30,Griffith Park,The Griffith Park is a hiking area on Mount Hollywood where the Griffith Observatory and Hollywood Sign sits. Many visitors and locals go for hike there and stay till evening to watch the LA city lights as the sun sets. Very nice view from here. Also this is where you get real close to the Hollywood sign. Must visit and see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pkh_travels
40,Magnificent views,"Magnificent views over LA! Depending on the moment of the day (hazy, smoggy, sunset, etc) views may differ but absolutely worth it. The planetarium/observatory is interesting but the majority of the visitors is there for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robbertl124
50,"Griffith Park, magical place","What a beautiful place to explore. The place is massive and so much to see. From the Griffith observatory, Old zoo, the LA zoo, Travel Town , etc.. beautiful place during the day, magical views during the night .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordi-cr7
50,Relax,Very attractive place to see. Relaxing environment to go with family and friends. Very nice tram to get there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mehrsh
40,A gem of a place so close to the urban LA,We went for a hike after soaking up the sights of Hollywood. Was a welcome break from the commercialism down the road. You can get some impressive views from the park and a stop into the observatory is recommended. We had a hazy day unfortunately but I can imagine the views to be spectacular on a clear one.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielT716
50,Hike to Griffith Park,"From he Griffith Park you can have an amazing panoramic view of LA. The hike is light, and the sunset is stunning there. Is a beautiful and safety place. I recommend going there either alone or with family or friends. Is the perfect place to have an idea of how huge is the city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdvalenciag
50,Great hike in Griffith Park!,We had a great time hiking in Griffith Park. Went to the top of Mt Hollywood and had great views of the area. At the end of our hike we visited the observatory which had several interesting exhibits. We will definitely do this again in future visits to LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toddosbeck
40,Good hike - nice views. Observatory itself far too crowded to bother with for long.,"Approached via Ferndell Park - indeed on a Sunday afternoon that itself adds another mile round trip length given that you will park down by the little bear. Did the complete (east + west) loop plus observatory extension. 3 miles total maybe. It's a gentle, but somewhat steep at times hike, with wide paths. (NOT much shade) Except for the western loop, you never really feel 'alone in nature'. Lots of folks. Good views on observatory leg with outcrop. Observatory itself offers great vistas but was completely overrun and overwhelmed with people. Call it a children's museum experience. Enough there that I might give it another shot mid-week sometimes but. Of special note - criticism - is the cafeteria. Great views - deplorable ""food"". I looked through as I was hungry after the climb, but no way. Go find a taco truck - geez.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Great place to see the Hollywood sign,"We only spent a hour exploring the park mostly to see the Hollywood sign at the observatory, great spot with lots of parking. We were there around 10am on a Saturday and were driving a large SUV, parked close to the observatory with ease. The observatory didn’t open until noon as did the restaurant, so pack water and food if you can’t wait. We seen tons of trails for hiking and biking, amazing views of LA! Beautiful park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wanderer0213
20,Too difficult to park,"We spent so long trying to park that it got dark and we couldn't see the Hollywood sign. It's not very well organised and there is nowhere near enough parking. We went in the quiet season too, I can't imagine what it's like in the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HBRoxx
50,Vast park for recreation and enjoyment,"A vast space having so many attractions is one of the most popular destinations in LA. We approached it from Los Feliz, after visiting Lovell Health House and sundry other sights.We enjoyed our time at the incomparable Observatory, and availed of a snack in the aptly named Cafe at the End of the Universe.Best views of the Hollywood Sign are to be had from the Park. In the clarity of the morning sunshine it looked particularly impressive.After strolling around we made our way to a Park exit passing the celebrated Greek Theatre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
50,Boy Scout trail hike up to Observatory,"We weren't sure how to get up to the Observatory since amber signs indicated that the parking lot was full. We did find a parking spot along Vista del Valle drive and it turns out we were right by the Boy Scout Trail head which leads up to the Observatory. The hike is a short, but somewhat steep 0.6 mile (we're senior citizens). There are views of the city and the Hollywood sign. The Observatory itself is educational... but it was crowded on the weekend. The cafe was horrible -- served ice-box cold hot dogs and the person behind the counter would neither heat the hot dog nor offered an exchange for a warm hot dog. Literally left a bad taste in our mouths.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdc8mbc
50,Stunning views of LA,"Really nice Hike with a guide, with stunning views of the city. I highly recommend. You can also go to the Griffith Observatory which is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baquardie
50,Great spot,"We landed at Burbank and this was the first place we came based on reviews. So glad we listened! It was a lovely afternoon 12/30/19 with lots of people parking and walking to see the Hollywood sign. Great views of it from the Griffith Observatory (which was closed that day). Griffith Park is amazing and so large-I’m sure we only saw a small part of it yet we parked, walked quite a ways and all the way up to the observatory. If I lived here this would be a favorite spot for me. So many little paths and hikes to explore. We loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hikinghappily62
50,"Good spot, great view","You have a great view of the LA city, plus information about space, plus you get to see the Hollywood sign, and you can walk closer",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenCierra
50,Great hiking in the middle of a city,"Very beautiful day in December, lots of people out and about it was crowded in the areas where you could see the Hollywood sign up close but on the trails it wasn't that crowded. The hiking is not that hard and there is no water on the trails so bring your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeesaD27
40,Much bigger than it looks,"We only spent a day here, but in that day we visited the observatory, dodged the rattlesnakes, hiked to the bronson caves, visited shanes inspiration (the kids loved it), visited Travel Town as well as drove quite a lot of the park.The only downside is that there is no place nearby to get food for lunch or such..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HypnoWarrior
40,Family friendly park with great views,We were visiting LA area and put Griffith park as one of the destinations. Our family enjoyed the hike up to the Observatory very much. Family-friendly trail (Ferndell) with nice shade for the most part of it. The elevation quickly went up towards the last section (maybe 10 minutes or so) but the view was well worth it!We also checked out the Pony Ride where my kids enjoyed so much they went 4 rounds.I only took off a star because the public restrooms are not well maintained and are quite dirty. Some water fountains are not functioning well. So plan your visit accordingly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momwithplan
50,Great park,This is a great park for shorter or longer hikes and the views over LA are just great. We hiked first from the Observatory to Mt. Hollywood and from there to Mt. Lee behind the Hollywood Sign and from there down via Burbank Peak / Wonder View Trail. I totally recommend this hike but there are several other routes you can also take.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Great place to vist!,"I used to go here when I was a child on school field trips. This place has incredible views of downtown LA, the Hollywood sign, great hiking trails. The obseratory was closed when I was there. Definitely a place to stop and visit when in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8153FGdavidg
50,"WOW, just ""WOW""","As a Canadian transplant , as awesome as Los Angeles is, sometimes you just need 'GREEN""...You know what I mean? Who would have thought that minutes from Sunset Boulevard is this urban oasis.The entry is a park with thick tress and mostly pretty but dry ravines. You are in this mini forest right inside LA!!CRAZY!! As you climb though, and pass the observatory, you reach a plateau that lets you see the whole of LA from Malibu to San Pedro. It is sooo worth it!! I would put this one my LA list!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/konstantinamahlia
40,Off the beaten path and great escape,"We rode the merry-go-round that inspired Walt Disney. It is in need of more love but go ride it. You can feel Mary Poppins riding the moving horses. The paintings and carvings are well worth the $2 ride! Parking is free so enjoy the experience.We were feeling lazy and cool so we opted to drive to the old zoo. Again, parking is free and plentiful so we could be lazy. Walking around the old zoo was an eye opener. It was depressing to see the animal enclosures knowing that is what we thought was suitable. It is refreshing to see the progress we have made in zoological sciences.Nice hike up to B rock for excellent views of LA.Walking around Griffith Park makes you forget you are in LA. It is wide open spaces and not too many people. We saw many groups picnicking. The playground was packed with kids and families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbbyers67
30,Merry go round was our highlight.,"This park is better enjoyed if you are up for hiking and long walks which we weren't on this specific day. Its a beautiful park for sure. We were delighted to find that the merry go round in Griffith Park is the one that Walt Disney brought his kids to play on and was the inspiration for Disneyland. That was pretty special, so of course we had to go on it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozeire
50,A sheer delight of LA,"Griffith park is a sheer delight of Los Angeles, its vast, several trails and landmarks contained within it most notably the Batcave entrance, take plenty of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard
50,Lots of hiking trails and very nice views of L.A.,"Griffith Park is a mountainous park in the heart of L.A. that offers visitors dozens of hiking trails along with city views, provided the sight is good and the city is not covered in smog. It is recommended to spend at least half a day or more in the park. The park also has the Griffith Observatory, and it's also an interesting site to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gonen2014
50,Great hikes in the heart of LA,Griffith Park offers great hiking options along the hills in the heart for Los Angeles. These are by far the best views of LA if you make the effort and hike to the hill tops. Surprisingly quiet considering how great the area is. Free parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeachStone2C
50,These views!,"Went on a busy Saturday afternoon, but it was still very nice to see and walk around a bit. There is so much to do and even more to see. If you're a movie buff, don't forget to look up in advance to see what has been filmed here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angelbear425
40,hard to park!,"We went here on a Saturday afternoon and it was tough to find somewhere to park close enough to the observatory, other than that is a great day to start or finish your day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyngtz
50,Magnificant park,"So many mountain hiking trails and such beautiful scenery. We hiked and toured the park. This 4,000 acre park is in the middle of Los Angeles. We visited the Griffith observatory at the park summit. You can see for miles in all directions, And there is a wonderful solar system display inside. We passed an outdoor theater and a spot with pony rides and a wonderful large carousal. Next time we will visit the Zoo and botanical gardens located in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/deanalang
50,Ponies and a train,"My Dad was born in Glendale, CA and I have been going to this park for over 50 years. Pony rides are closed on Mondays but when they are open it is very fun for kids to ride around the track. There is also a train and snack bar. All are a fair price. The grounds are beautiful and usually crowded on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7753RAmaryb
50,Hiking in Griffith Park,"GP is about 6-1/2 square miles of great hiking. It's hot in summer, but in winter is when it really gets great. Hike to Mt Hollywood, Cahuenga Peak, Mt Lee, or even to the observatory, on a warm clear winter afternoon, and see the sun shining off the ocean. At sunset the show gets even better, since in winter the sun sets over the ocean instead of behind the mountains, and elevation coupled with the the low horizon produces the best sunsets I know of. Wait until the sky near the horizon breaks into prism bands to display a horizontal rainbow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevincA8344UK
40,Great views of LA,"Parked on one of the hills and had a 15-20 minute walk to the top. Once you reach the observatory there are conveniently placed toilets and water fountains, also Wi-fi but it didn't seem to work when we were there. Views are incredible and make the long hike well worth it. Would definitely recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesgood97
50,World Renown Telescope and related.,"This Observatory has been around for quite some time, but the attraction has only improved over the period of time of its existence. Even the magnificent views of Los Angeles are impressive, to say the least. The viewing and information are exemplary and plenty of convenient parking as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthonygW9228EC
50,Griffith Observatory,Highly recomendable visit. Educational shows are great. Views from the hill to LA are incredible. Museum itself great. Observations of moon and planets excellent.The place is a few miles from downtown and it deserves at least a whole afternoon to appreciate,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielferrari14
50,Amazing views and surprisingly peaceful.,"We visited quite early one morning and were amazed how relaxing and peaceful this place was. Parking was easy and free, we found a spot near the bottom of the hill but it only took about 10 minutes to walk up to the Observatory. Great views, it feels a world away from the very busy LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZoeB762
50,Great fun for families.,Various hiking paths . From easy to professional levels. Choose your path and make sure you have sunblock and water.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evantzolos
50,Great for Hiking,Has tons of parking.Different trails for hiking.Rangers patrolling area!Friendly hikers :)Overall great place!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mozayumm
30,Lovely views of the city- very busy,"You know you have hit the jackpot when it’s busy, like really busy so bear that in mind. The other major negative is parking- seriously the rates they charge are an absolute scam hence my review reduced to three stars.The views are beautiful, panoramic even and the trails great for a casual walk.Had lunch in the cafe area and that was alright too.Summary: worth it for the views just be savvy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GowerDG
40,Observation platform,"We went up to Griffith Park for the views only, you need to go early to Avoid parking fees, before midday week days and before 10am weekends. The view from the top is great and worth a ride up to the top. Toilet facilities are available at the top if the observatory is closed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/18Kel
40,Hiking with Barkley,The trails were good ones! We then stopped at the picnic area to get a drink of water for Barkley at the water fountain but it was covered with bees! He did get a drink at the second fountain! I did not horseback ride or visit the trains but next time I will! Great day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577auroram
20,Be aware of the car parking SCAM!!,"This review is based entirely on using the park as a viewing point. It is NOT a review of all of the park areas and the Observatory because I did not visit these areas.Parking at the summit is limited and there are parking space payment meters. These parking meters are signposted as PAY HERE $10 PER HOUR. PAID PARKING ENFORCED. However, the sign also states, in much smaller lettering, that the hourly charge is only enforced Monday-Friday 12:00PM - 10PM and Saturday-Sunday 10AM-10PM. This means that no payment is required if you park outside these times. I noticed that people were paying for parking at 10am on the Tuesday I visited because they did not read the small print and just saw the large $10 PER HOUR text. I'm sure the signs are designed to scam people and it is working! Most people were paying for something they didn't need to pay for!The views over LA in general are stunning from the summit and well worth the visit.However, anyone hoping to get a good photo of the Hollywood sign will need to use their zoom. So if you are also hoping to take a photo of someone with the Hollywood sign in the background then forget it because if you zoom in enough to get the sign in shot then the person will be out of focus. There are much better places to photograph the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/859raymondp
50,Amazing hikes,"Some real nice hiking to be done here. nice views of the city, Hollywood sign. Managed to run into a pack of 6 coyote also, they were gone so fast haha.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jerodkey
50,Wonderful way to spend the day,"We parked by the old zoo picnic area and there was plenty of parking. Staying away from the observatory seems to be the trick.We explored the abandoned zoo and then ended up hiking for hours. We hadn’t planned on that but the area was pretty and we challenged ourselves to find the Hollywood sign. We did!! Only 2 letters visible but we did it!The trails could use a few more signs, but overall the park is a great value!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leahb908
40,Great views,We took an Uber there from Hollywood and Highland shopping centre. The views are really good and this was the closest we got to the sign. On the way back my daughter saw a coyote in the woods.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GO50
40,Must see for 1st time,"Parking might be tricky also because it is prepaid 10 dollar per hour. After that you will get a view on LA and the Hollywood sign. The museum is also interesting, with video shows, meteorites, explanation about the universe and time on earth.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mijnprofiel
40,Nice (accessible) hikes,"A simple stroll or a multi-hour hike are a perfect complement to visiting the observatory.I visited the park multiple time, and always liked it. Next: see the views at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FM6565
50,Views are incredible,"Love to take out of town guest there to see the sites....of course you must bet on a good weather day and that we had. I love the interior , but nothing compared to the outside and views. Must give yourself time due to traffic getting up there and make sure its not the same time as a show at the Greek Theater",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/179pamt
40,A nice place to be to enjoy the views of inspiring environments,"This park around the Griffith Observatory provides opportunities for nice walks. Liked to explore the environment and combined our visit to this park with the near located Barnsdall Art Park,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AB_Stb_OZ
40,An oasis of verdant tranquility amidst the smog and bustle of Tinseltown,"My closest friend on the planet has lived in the Los Feliz neighborhood section of L.A. since the 1990s, and we like to take our morning constitutionals in adjacent Griffith Park when I'm in town to enjoy the (relatively) clean air and quiet of the location. Four or five years had elapsed since I last visited my old partner in crime, and the park hasn't changed one bit in the intervening time (thank God). There are horse-riding trails for equestrian enthusiasts, by the way (I ain't one of them).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joecF6695JN
40,Well worth the walk,"We visited on a weekend and the car park at the top as well as the road up was full. We parked for free in a field at the bottom of the road up. If you cant make the climb up the hill you can get disabled parking at the top or drop off the less able passengers and the go down and park.There is lots to see apart from the view of the Hollywood sign, with displays and a pay for planetarium show (well worth it)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Admcck
50,One of my favorite places to visit when in LA,It is one of my favorite places to visit when in LA. Free of charge and spectacular . Not cheep and cheesy. Spectacular views especially at sun set. And the visit to observatory is a cherry on the top of he cake . Note that on some days observatory is open till 10pm. But note: it gets really crowded here .....best if you don’t drive here but hike if you can.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
50,What an amazing spot,"We were advised to check this location out prior to planning our vacation to California (driving trip). It didn't seem like much but we are so glad my family made the visit. In fact, it was so cool we went 2 days in a row to take our time to see everything. Whether you enjoy astronomy or not it will entertain anyone. The views alone are spectacular.Some advice: Go a few hours before nightfall. That way you can see the Hollywood sign (it is not lit up at night). Then when it gets dark, you can partake into the observatory for history on space history. I'm a science geek and loved every corner of the museum. There are several floors with different topics covered. parking is $10/hour at the top but you can take the bus up or park at the bottom of the hill and take the nice 1 mile walk up the path to the top. Your hard work will pay off.If you go later, be expected to have long line ups with cars. As well, there is Greek theater that holds concerts and other performances throughout the month. Try to time it so you don't go up on those days as parking will be even more challenging to find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fearjac
40,A Must See place in LA!,"This huge park has something for everyone. Great hikes, you can hike up to the Hollywood sign. The Ferndale side off of Western Blvd. has a quiet stream.They have the Griffith Observatory which has great shows AND views of the city.Near the 5 freeway they have pony rides and a train for the little ones. Just take that ride in and you can go to the L A Zoo.Across from the Zoo is the Autry Museum of the West. It has a wealth of western history and art.They are also near the carousel and several playgrounds. This park is AWESOME!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
40,Pony Rides,"My 5-year-old granddaughter was looking forward to riding a real horse. There is the choice of having your 100-pound or lighter child ride a small, medium or large horse. The children I saw really enjoyed their rides. Each ride is $5.00.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenak63

50,Wonderful sunset at Griffith,"Absolutely amazing colors in the sky and an amazing view of the whole city. It was crowded, but there was still enough room to see Bothell the Hollywood sign during the sunset and when the sun finally set, there was as amazing fiery of the night skyline of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackienet
50,Beautiful,This is a beautiful park that you'll pass through on the was up to the observatory. It is worth a visit on it's own merit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyt200
40,Nice park with great views,Our main draw was to come see the observatory. But of course the park itself has beautiful views and there is the Hollywood sign.The hillside is nice and there are trails through the hills. A children’s play area (jungle gym) at the bottom was great. We would come again just to explore the park and it’s hills/trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dinfamily2009
40,For the outdoorsy travelers,Griffith Park offers lots of walking and hiking trails. You can also ride your bike through if that’s more up your alley. You can see the famous Hollywood sign while in at the park and there is lots of shade if you need an escape from the summer heat. It’s a nice break from the hustle and bustle of downtown. It’s very large so I would ask a local where to go or take a guide with you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/201leannen
30,Careful of the bushes,Griffith park is basically ok. You can see shows there. You also can see gays screwing in the bushes. Not a place for kids. Doubt I'll ever go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer780991

50,Great views and free,"Great views - be sure to go on all levels and decks for different views. I would do the decks first then you can cool down in the museum. There's plenty of hiking here and maps are available of the trails, or use Google Maps. Free Wi-Fi too! You can Uber here and avoid the parking problems but call for your Uber early because they take a little time in getting there. There's one designated area for Uber pickup.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorig689

50,Beautiful hike with view of the city,"We have hiked several times up to the Griffith Observatory and it is an uphill hike but not too long from the parking lot up to the Griffith Observatory (took maybe 30 minutes). Parking is free at the bottom but fills up especially on weekends later in the morning. There are amazing views of downtown LA and the Hollywood Sign and the trails have people on them but it has never been too crowded. Griffith Park Observatory is really cool to see in person and you can walk around inside as well. You pay for parking up here but it is always really crowded with cars, buses, and Ubers so I would rather hike up instead of drive up. Would definitely recommend this hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emilytO6138AN
50,Old LA Zoo in Griffith Park,"Griffith Park is beautiful and has a lot to offer in general. The old LA Zoo is site of many shows/movies such as Jerry McGuire and Anchorman. In fact, while we were there they were filming a Lifetime movie. You can venture around and go in the cages if you like. Beautiful sight for a picnic or leisurely day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GotMyGoShoesOn
50,Hiking at Griffith Park,I leave at Los Feliz area. I take morning walks to Griffith Park Ferndale trail. It is beautiful. It has small creeks. There is a coffee shop called Trails. It is convenient to stop for a cup of coffee. The guy works there is very rude. I love nature and very much enjoy walking at this place. There are public toilets on the ground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mlalik

40,Needs better paths,"Griffith Park is big and varied and definitely worth visiting. However, it’s set up for cars and lacks walking paths in key areas while many of the ones it has are wide dusty roads or footpaths beside roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdom
40,A nice spot,"It is -at least- a free-of-charge spot in LA. You only have to pay for parking. It offers a magnificent view to the city and to the sign, while if you go inside you learn lots of things. It is worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lanthopo
50,Hollywood sign hike,Hiked to the Hollywood sign via HollyRidge Trail at Griffith park. Would have liked to hike behind the sign but could not get close from this trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F5749WHmarkm
50,There is so much here...,"Griffith Park is an amazing place--it has the Griffith Observatory, The Gene Autry Western Museum and tons of hiking and walking adventures. Plan to spend the whole day, but decide what you want to do before you get there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless730216
50,Go there at night,"To get a view of Los Angeles this is the place to be at night. The scale of the city is still unfathomable, but a beautiful quaint place to be. And there are astronomy enthusiasts that have their telescopes and guide and teach you about the stars and galaxies. Fun place to be.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Umayrmasud
50,BREATH TAKING,We were so enraptured by the natural beauty of this region and thankful that we chose to stay in a location that allowed us such easy access to the enormous park and the stunning views from it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
50,Great Hiking Trails,My friend and I Uber'd to the park which was a very easy option. There are plenty of places for a quick pick up/drop off here.There are nice options for hiking once you get to the park. We took a trail that was higher intensity on the way up and then found a more groomed path for the way down. The trails were well tended and there are trash cans along the way to help keep the space clean. We enjoyed great views of downtown LA as well as the Hollywood sign. You can really make this hike as long or short as you'd like and would still enjoy nice views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allysong255
50,Larger than Central Park and a more Natural Setting,"Griffith Park is larger than New York's Central Park. Most of the park is the natural setting of the mountainous areas with plenty of hiking trails, picnic spots, quaint places to rent for a special day. If you are so included, you can head all the way up to the Observatory as well - a true LA icon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alexander_Designs

50,A great place to hike,"My friend and I drove through the park first, but there was nowhere to park, so we decided to come back the next morning. We got there early, and parked at the bottom in the free parking area. We did the mile walk up to the observatory, and it was a nice little hike. Everything was so green and it wasn't too hot, and it was a perfect day weather wise. It wasn't too crowded when we started, though it did get more crowded as the day went on. If you're going to go to the observatory, I suggest walking through the park is the way to go because it's free and a great nature hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hmill42894

50,Great place for an early morning hike,"As Midwesterners visiting LA, we’ve visited Griffith Park a couple of times in the morning and found it to be a peaceful way to start the day.We hiked up a couple of miles, leaving my parents at the little garden near Dante’s View.Be ready to dodge some dog poop (and horse poop), but the views of Los Angeles more than make up for this.Parking at the Observatory is free until noon, so this is a great spot to start a hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naptime17
40,Great on a cooler day to go walk about,"Take a picnic and chill out for a few hours here with some friends. Parking is easy which is a pleasure in LA as everywhere else is sooo difficult parking , and expensive. Parking is free here .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/londonlouise43

40,Biggest public park in America,"There are plenty of trails to hike and on a clear day, incredible views. Best of all it's FREE. Great way to escape the hectic downtown LA scene and relax. Pack a bottle of water and a camera and enjoy. If you get a chance, get up to the Griffith Observatory. If for nothing else, a great photo op and view. Expect crowds though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfm02719
40,We took e-bikes here and loved it,"While I was not that impressed with the park itself, there are many great areas in it with fun things for kids to do (pony rides, train rides, carousel, hiking) as well as horse back riding. We rode our e-bikes and that was pretty cool, and I hear there is great hiking in here as well. There are many areas for picnicking as well, and to have a huge park in the middle of a city is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374barbh
50,Sunset walk,"A lovely park, and fairly easy walk uphill. The Griffith Observatory is about halfway and busy with tourists, but if you keep heading up, things quieten down. Top of the hill overlooking the Hollywood sign, a lovely place to see the sun go down. Take a torch - after the sun goes, it get dark quickly and tricky to find the right paths beyond the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlexH0lmes
40,"Road Bicycling Grifith Park, Technically Challenging but Worth It","The world does not need another review of the Observatory. I rented a road bike to tour Griffith Park. This allowed me to see much more of the park with limited time. There are well-marked bicycle lanes on many of the roads. It is a good work out with plenty of hills to challenge you. Some of the roads are in rough shape with lots of rocks and pot holes so be sure to be alert and possibly consider a hybrid or mountain bike instead of a road bike if you are going to get adventurous. I had to stop briefly for a Showtime TV show shoot but then got to ride through the set. This was very interesting. There are adequate rest room facilities and water on most of the routes but bring enough for your ride, especially if it is warm and sunny. Given the limited opportunities to ride in the city, this is a fun ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DT355
50,A Must Do,"My husband and I hiked through some of the trails in Griffith Park to make our way up to the Observatory to see the views of Los Angeles and to see the Hollywood sign. There are many different paths that you can take up to the top. We took our time to take in the views and the scenery along the way.When we got to the top, the Observatory wasn't open as we were too early, but we still were able to take in the views from around the Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrs_B_Perth
40,Great Trails,Would love a place like this at home. Countless trails of various lengths and difficulty. Beautiful views. Bronson Caves in many famous films and TV. Would be nice to have some shuttle service around the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DLCote
50,"Nice old observatory, great views, Hollywood sign","This location had a great observatory and a small astronomy-related museum throughout the building (also go downstairs where there is a gallery between the gift shop and the cafe), a 12 inch Zeiss refracting telescope that is used for public observing in the evening depending on the weather and clear skies, and several other amenities in the park which we did not see. There is no fee to go into the observatory. There is a planetarium show offered three times a day which does include a fee.You will likely have to part near the Greek Theatre at the base and either take the long walk uphill or grab the DASH redline bus. $.50 per person and $.25 per senior. Bring exact change- not dollar bills as the money is calculated as it drops into the hopper. Outside restroom lines may be long. Instead, take the elevator from the tall elevator kiosk near the observatory to Lower Level 2. There are restrooms with about 18 stalls per male/female restrooms. No one really knows about it. A staff member mentioned them to us when we were waiting in line. The bathrooms are older with a 1920s or 1930s feel, which was kinda nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daler0753
40,Best sport to see all LA,"I lived in LA 12 years and from this park, besides the exciting trails you can have, you can look at some of the most beautiful villas of LA, Stunning view of Downtown, and last but not least reach the Gripphit observatory where you have a wide view of LA and Hollywood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/795rickyt
40,Paid for the night view,"There used to be free parking on the roadsides where you can walk 5-10 mins to the observatory, but now city LA parking sets pay stations and charges all of the free parking... You can still park far and take the shuttle or walk to the observatory.The night view is still great here, but you can probably check Hollywood bowl overlook as an alternative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CraigL0803

50,"Great place for a picnic, a bike ride or a hike!",Griffith Park is very large and right in the heart of Los Angeles. It has multiple hiking trails and picnic areas for everyone. It is popular with cyclists especially on the weekends. You can also go horse back riding! There is also an area with trains that the kids can explore. There is a great hike that will take you all the way up to the Observatory. The hiking trails get very crowded on the weekends.

There were quite a few people there on a Sunday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizhar76

50,Amazing area on the edge of LA,"We have been here several times for hiking trips and nature walks. the facility has a lot of great infrastructure like picnic tables, BBQs, play structures for the kids and of course a lot of great hiking trails.

50,Walk up the Hollywood Hill,"We wanted to walk up to the Hollywood Sign, we did not realise just how big Griffith Park was. Wow what a view from the top.

50,Best view of the whole city,"My friends and I do some hikes here from time to time. Be careful at night considering we had to fight off some Coyotes which was way too similar to Liam Neeson in the Grey for our liking. However, the view is always worth it no matter what kind of Adventure you end up in at Griffith Park. Don't drink in public or smoke a ciggy here though because the Rangers will get you in trouble for that. However, this is the best damn nature escape there is in Los Angeles. A must for travelers and locasls alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/captain_nomad

50,View worth to come up,"For one night we wanted to see Los Angeles from above. We were thinking about a rooftop bar, but coming to this park was the better decision. With a breathtaking lookout over the skyscrapers and lights in the night, without too much noise, it was like being in a remote movie. Could have sit here for hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nyyan
40,LA City view from top,We visited at day time. Though it was foggy but the LA city view was awesome. I believe the night view of the city from this point should be more beautiful and I'll definitely back for that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arijit_here2007

50,Great park with tons to do,"Definitely one of my favorite places in Los Angeles. There's tons of trails for every skill level and it's big enough that it feels like you're away from the city without having to go far. The trails have great views and there's always fun events going on, especially during the summer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cristine4412

50,MASS TRANSIT (OR GETTING BY TRANSIT TO THE OBSERVATORY),"For the Griffith Observatory you can take L.A. County Department of Transportation's ""OBSERVATORY"" dash bus which runs 7 days a week HOWEVER<< THE OBSERVATORY IS CLOSED ON MONDAYS. If you are staying in Downtown Los Angeles take the RED LINE subway to Vermont/Sunset station and wait for this bus on the Vermont Avenue side (you'll see the LADOT bus stop sign saying OBSERVATORY) on the same side of the station entrance you came out of. If you are coming from your hotel in the San Fernando Valley get to the Chandler and Lankershim RED LINE subway station (THIS IS THE LAST STOP IN THE VALLEY) and take this train to the very same stop as described above (VERMONT/SUNSET). The bus runs frequently and since Griffith Park closes at 10pm YOU MUST BE AT THE DASH BUS STOP AT THE OBSERVATORY AT ABOUT 9:50PM AS THE LAST BUS GOES DOWN THE HILL AT 10PM SHARP. As you arrive at the observatory, you will notice that you were fortunate to take transit as opposed to driving as parking is a royal pain and traffic as well but, being on the DASH OBSERVATORY bus gives you an advantage, that the traffic police usually halt the cars and let the bus through. The bus begins mon-fri about 12noon on weekends and holidays at about 10am. Fare is 50¢ for adults and 25¢ for seniors and disabled. If you purchased the EZ TRANSIT PASS from the LOS ANGELES MTA THIS BUS IS INCLUDED AND YOU DO NOT PAY ANYTHING ON THIS BUS.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel8390
50,Hike to the back of the Hollywood Sign,This was quite a hike but well worth it. Pack a good amount of water and a hat! The trail is mostly dirt until you reach the road that takes you to the back of the Hollywood sign. The views throughout the hike are beautiful. Once you reach the back of the sign you can climb this little area and do a panorama shot to get the entire sign. Theres also a seismology monitor at the top which is pretty cool.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JessiAnn85
50,Waking with the Stars,"Most amazing view of LA from balconies and terraces.Watch planets, stars and satellites with telescope and explained entirely by experts.

50,Beautiful hiking!,"This is a beautiful area to hike in! There are many places to start, and many different areas to go. If you go when the Griffith Observatory is closed, parking is free in that lot (it’s $6 or $8 to park when it is open) and there is a great trail off the Charlie Turner Trailhead. We’ve also started near Fern Dell Drive where the parking is free. There are trails for every level of hiker. There are some good websites that list the trails. You can get a great hike as a tourist without taking a guided tour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HollyO381
50,The place to be for walking/trekking or to take great pictures,"We have been there many times, you must go if you are visiting LA for a great picture of the city and the Hollywood sign. Beware: on the weekends road to reach the Observatory is normally closed due to no place to park. you may chose to leave your car on the bottom and walk up - it may take you 20-30 minutes depending where you parked! I strongly recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sergiobV6825OA

50,Iconic spot in the center of LA,"Of course, there really IS no center of LA, which somebody famous once called '85 towns crammed together searching for an identity.' Griffith Park is enormous, offering pleasant hikes, an outdoor train museum, the Greek Theatre and of course, the Observatory. An excellent escape from the concrete chaos....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3625WZpaulb
30,"Nice park, but not for a casual bike ride","We rode bikes we checked out of our hotel to the park.....only to discover it’s not that kind of park, meaning we got there but couldn’t just ride around the park. You could risk your life riding in the few narrow roads, or maybe if we had planned better found a place to leave the bikes and go walking. Not really bike paths..... plus lots of hills! Most people seemed to drive to the part of the park they wanted to be at and parked there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tuli763

40,"Awesome Hike with views of LA, the Griffith Observatory + Hollywood sign","We parked in the free parking area east of the Griffith Observatory and googled mapped the Captain's Roost hike. It took about 30-40min. It's uphill so it can be a bit challenging if you have kids but it's not impossible either. Once you reach the top you get amazing city views, a view of the Hollywood sign and a view of the Griffith Observatory too (see pictures below). It's a great way to do something free and fun in LA. Bring water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joseltravels
40,Awesome Park,"There's a little bit of everything tucked away in Griffith Park. Horse trails, Gene Autry West Museum, hiking trails, Zoo, the Observatory. The list goes on. My last visit I went exploring around the old Griffith Park Zoo. Some of the old cages still stand. It's cool to check out and odd that they're still there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jointfilms
50,Accessible nature and beauty,"Never a bad experience. Moving from NY to LA, I compare Central Park and Griffith Park in my mind, nature in a big city, but Griffith Park is really like leaving the city behind. Going to Griffith Park might be more like escaping out of NY to go upstate, but without the two hours it takes to get out of the city. It's a treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quarchias
50,Beautiful Urban Green Space,Drove up here to get a view of the Hollywood sign. Parking was definitely at a premium - but the park itself is beautiful. Walking trails and picnic areas provide some nice options.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Altius10

30,Expectations! Great Expectations,"Living DIRECTLY across the river from Griffith Park for over 30 years has taught me to appreciate a few things. 1st...It is the Largest Muni Park in the World!! Oh yeah over 4,000 acres. From Travel Town Train Museum to the North, 5 Fwy on the East, Los Feliz Blvd (kinda) South and then Western Blvd on where else? The West! What can you do Here? Name it The Griffith Park has it regardless of LA City has tried to do! There is Horse/Bicycle riding, Hiking (Be Careful), The Zoo, Gene Autry Western Museum (My Fav) as I mention Travel Town which no matter how old you are is a great attraction! There is a very small pony ride place at the Riverside Drive entrance by the East end. This is where you also access all of the above. Now the Middle, which has the Observatory (see my other review on this) the Greek theater which is where concerts rage during the warmer months because it is outside. And finally there was or is Fern-Dale. which use to be a lovely walk in a semi-tropical forest area off of Western Blvd entrance. It has fallen in disrepair. But people line up to get water from a natural spring...Yeah Right it is LA City Water folks. Go to the main attractions during the day and the Observatory at night. Stay in public areas and if you see people you'd rather not be with. Then don't get out of your car!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevesR2784SM
40,"A pain to get to, but worth it.","It took trying on two evenings to get a place to park. The hike up is not suitable for everyone so we needed to park closer. Both nights the main parking area was full, but we were able to park on the approaching road on the second try. The museum is informative and interesting. The views are amazing. You must go at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SEFowler
50,"Plenty of visitors, but not terribly crowded","Ok, my reason for coming here was probably a bit different than most. I was looking for a few hours of trail running in the L.A. area, while also checking out the Hollywood sign. I sort of can’t believe that after nearly 40 years in SoCal, I hadn’t yet visited this landmark in person! I suppose that after a while, it was easy to write it off as “just a tourist thing”.Starting from a tennis court parking lot opposite Roosevelt Muni Golf Course, a steep trail leads to a ridge overlooking Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills and the city of Burbank to the north and Los Angeles and the Griffith Observatory to the south. From there it connects to a wide dirt road that winds to the west toward the Hollywood sign.I figured I’d return to my starting point by descending the steep dirt road that leads southwest to Canyon Dr, then follow the trail northeastward until I’d completed a loop. Well, I DID get to see the “Batcave” (a la Batman TV series), but the “trail” to the northeast led up the wall of a steep rocky bowl. So much for trusting maps, even ones based on satellite images!All-in-all, though, it was a fun adventure, one that I’m glad I experienced. And plenty of workout.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mtrob326
40,Incredible Views,Griffith Park is a great place to hike. The Mt. Hollywood hiking trail was moderately challenging and provided incredible views of the Hollywood hills. The trail culminates with two nice vantage points for photo ops with the Hollywood Sign. Very clean trail.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/966jona
40,Nice,"I wish I was there at night... I was not... so, we walked around the park and... it is a nice park... though... at night it would have been much better...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MarcinDrP
50,Amazing views,A highlight of our visit to LA. Great place for getting amazing photos of Hollywood sign and view over the city. Also enjoyed the gardens around observatory. Gets crowded so plan accordingly. Would love to visit for sunset views and also see inside the observatory itself which was closed when we visited. Great for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kathstevens2017
50,Excellent vistas of all of the greater LA area on clear night or sunny day,"I have been at night and in the afternoon under full sunlight. I prefer the evening views and the lights of planes coming in or leaving from the LA area airports. But the views at any time of day are breathtaking. Plus you can see the plantarium and the telescope. If you are a fan of movies from La La Land now back to Rebel Without a Cause many decades ago, this also is a must-see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/176abb
30,Very hot in summer and sloped. Hard for walking,"The park is between the city, the old zoo and the gold course; the observatory with the same name; and Hollywood sign. Very hot and most of the area totally brown in summer. Watch your feet going up and down the hills. The slopes will give you an extra hard sportive excursion. Take your own food and as much water as possible (camel bag is more appropriate to be hydrated all the time). Anyway, Be careful with the sun.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josegV3393SU
50,VAST BEAUTIFUL PARK IN THE HEART OF L.A.,"You can hike on a path, or up to the Observatory (for a great view of the Hollywood sign and the surrounding hills). It's a vast, beautiful park with many different trails...and a carousel!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miriyamg
50,a must in LA,This is free with views of the entire city. It is well worth the trip. Parking does cost $12 but I would highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamierZ6696UR
10,Waste of time.,"Not much up there other than a nice view of LA. It was so crowded, had to park and take a shuttle bus to the observatory. The observatory was ok but I am not a big fan of planetariums. A long time to take in a good view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WoodridgeGreg
50,some many things so little time,"This is amazing -Central Park eat your heart out. Try the pony rides or horse rental, the Gene Autry museum is incredible., world class zoo, train city is amazing, just the drive in the park is like you are in the wilderness",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P8699UAkarenp
50,Wonderful Views,"The views from Griffith Park and the observatory were wonderful, however make sure you have reliable internet connection as when you leave the observatory you won't be able to find any wifi if you need to look up buses or Ubers. My sister and I made the mistake of hiking from Griffith Observatory to the Old LA Zoo and got stuck at the information centre as we couldn't contact an Uber.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomadartemis
40,Great views of Los Angeles at Night,It might take people sometime to get to Griffith Park. The observatory is located near by and also has multiple place for people to look at views of the city.

50,Beautiful,"This park has a lot to offer. From the Griffith Observatory, Hiking Trails, ""The Trails"" Coffee shop in Fern Dell, There is a small golf course across from the outdoor concert theater",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W8922SSlisat
40,Lots of park -- not that many roads,There's no reason to feel crowded in Griffith Park --- but the way the roads are you're going to be next to a lot of people -- so drift to the unused areas and get some privacy!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rapr0ducer
50,Beautiful nature preserve in the heart of the city.,"This is a beautiful park and L.A. is very lucky Mr Griffith donated this land. However, this hike is not for the unprepared! I saw many tourist out with no water, wearing sandals, carrying small children, etc. The trail is very hot, sunny, dusty, and long. Do yourself a favor and only hike this trail if you are prepared or sign up for a guided hike!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yfarm
50,Amazing Views of Los Angeles,"I've been coming to this park since i was a little girl and was always amazed with the view.

50,A place you can go day or night and see the sights!,"A lovely place to go when the weather is not too hot! The Griffith Observatory, located on the grounds is also a place you should visit if you go. The views are great, but be prepared for walking up hills unless you begin at the top.A few tips:1) You can see the Hollywood sign from the park as well!2) Parking can be difficult to find and you may have to walk more;3) Better to depart before 10 pm, when traffic is more restricted",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DRLieberson
30,Best views of LA,"The observatory is a must-see in LA and I've been there several times. It can get pretty crowded so I recommend off-times. You used to be able to park along the road leading up to the top but last year they installed parking pay stations so no more free parking. There aren't enough restrooms and the park rangers have been rude and ungracious. BUT these views are the best so make the trip anyways. There's some good hiking in the area if you'd like, so bring water, a compass and good shoes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Partera60
20,Crowded,"This used to be a better managed park. But the current LA Mayor has encouraged massive tourism into this park and the residential neighborhoods surrounding. Most of the wildlife has disappeared that I used to see (deer, coyote, rabbits, etc.) being forced deeper into the quieter areas of the hills. It's not easy to find parking on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioAngelina
50,"Nice view, interesting exhibitions","Arrived at around 9 AM, and we got ourselves parking place very near the entrance. If you arrive after 10 you probably have to park your car a bit distance from then entrance. Nice view of LA, and the whole family stayed for 5 hours at Griffith. We tried to go after dark, but park and entrance was closed due to a big fire a few days before. Really recommend this to everyone. Exhibit was very well organized, and both kids and adults learned a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/657stigj
50,Amazing Views,"Definitely worth visiting as you see amazing views of the City of Angels. Been both in the day and the evening, and it doesn't fail to impress - you see LA from a different perspective and appreciate it for it's natural beauty and cosmopolitan feel. Recommend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdevgun
50,Sad about the burn... but go at night.,"As the evening tempers the heat, there is an effect that causes a light breeze when you stand on the ridge or the balcony of the observatory. The view on most nights, overlooking Los Angeles, is why they call it Angel's Rest. The view is what inspired the cover of the book about Los Angeles-- titled Angel Flights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PickyBaer
40,Nice view of the city,"It is a good place to view city from a hill top and Griffith observatory is nice place to visit if you like sightseeing and great architecture. Unforturenately, I visited on a very hot day. So its hard to stay outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gayan1991
50,must visit even on the day it closes,"must visit even on the day it closes. We went on Monday, still crazy crowded, but it is so worth it. clean bathroom even on the days it's closed.

50,Running and biking paradise,"The dirt running paths are great on their own. Knowing that they come smack dab in the middle of the city and can whisk you away from the noises of traffic and the demands of daily life makes them all the sweeter. There are also a number of paved roads good for bicycling, some that are currently closed to cars. Get out there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexmjeffries
50,Scoping Out the City,Great attraction in Los Angeles. One of the best places to get a view of teh city and just chill. Can't beat on a sunny day with view from downtown LA to the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexandreesteban
50,"Awesome, just not on weekends","We made two visits, one on Sunday night (bad idea) the other on a Tuesday afternoon (much better) Drive up to the Greek Theater and use the free parking/shuttle bus or Walk it as you are only a mile away. We did te Red Line Dash Bus up and got stuck waiting 40 minutes for another bu to bring us back down. Lots to see and do, or you can just relax and enjoy the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damonm43
40,"No cell phone coverage, so couldn't get an Uber/taxi","The place was lovely, many vistas from the building itself and also in the carpark area of the Hollywood sign and LA.

50,#1 Park to visit if your in L.A,"Ive visited all the parks big and small in L.A area and I love Griffith Park the most. You have endless trails to hike within the park and you can always find some seclusion any time of the year here. Its a huge park and inside you will find all worthwhile attractions of the L.A Zoo, Autry Museum and the Observatory. There is also a great little cafe near the entrance called the Trails, here you will find yummy pie and date milk. A little expensive but worth the splurge if your visiting. I love this park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Such a great experience,We rolled up to Griffith Park on an extremely sunny Saturday and hiked the easy trail (mainly as we didnt really know how else to get around) but it was extremely sunny and I forgot to bring a hat. You'll need to bring water if you're going to stay out for a long period of time but I really recommend doing it. We were out for 2 hours but sadly didnt get as close as desired to the Hollywood Sign!Next Time!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/snooks23
50,Definitely a place to visit,"Griffith Park is the best place to see LA from above. Excellent view, can be very romantic at the sunset. Plus you have the Hollywood sign ""right there"" (perfect option to take good photos of it!) and Observatory (even if it would be just a short visit, it is worth every minute of your time!!!). Parking can be problematic (number of spaces upstairs is limited, but there is a lot of street parking available, however it can take you a good walk to get there on top). Hiking there is good, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/786malgorzatac
50,Beautiful Nature In the Middle of the City!,"I mostly went for the Observatory itself but the park surrounding it is also amazing with its pine trees, rugged hills, and smooth trails that are easy to walk and get around! Even though it’s in the middle of LA and you can see the skyscrapers in the distance, it still feels like you’re out experiencing nature in some faraway place. We’re lucky here in SoCal to have this as a resource to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Lovely place for families,"The place is really quite big in an accessible location. Great pony rides, mini-train and a zoo! Very pleasant environment and enjoyable day spent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1bloodyfool
20,Too big and too many entrances,"I hate this park, it has many entrances, and they didn't connect with each other, there is no main entrance or main park. Google map will guide you to an entrance close to you. I was coming from the north highway, you can never find a big park like the picture. It is so confusing. The people showed the good picture, could you post the exact address of the entrance？",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/980liuy
40,In La La land!,Extremely interesting exhibits and talks. Planetarium shows worth paying for . Wonderful views and trails round about. . Restaurant a bit pricy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanC710
50,Iconic views!!,If you go to LA Griffith Park is a must. The views are awesome and the hiking trails can be as challenging as you like. If you want to do it justice set aside a couple of days and really explore every inch.....it is worth it!! We spoke to a wonderful friendly guide at the ranger station and she gave us loads of helpful tips. So it's worth paying them a visit if you've never been there before.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/23laurenced
50,An Amazing Urban Adventure,"Angelenos are so lucky to have this urban gem topped with the Observatory (LA's hood ornament). This park is my 'go to' for training, both cycling and running.

30,"Park is big, but watch out for homeless people","This park is big...there are many sections...golf course, playgrounds, and hiking. However, some areas are inundated with homeless people camping in bushes with their junk all about...these areas did not feel safe...or sanitary...we had children with us and we saw a totally (and I mean totally) nude man walking around with everything hanging out! Stay out of these areas!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob

40,One of the largest urban park in the country,"A total of 4310 acres was donated to the city of Los Angles by Griffith J. Griffith.

50,Perfect Place for a Short Visit,"We were in LA for 4 or so hours and decided to do Santa Monica and Griffith Park. Griffith Park was a great addition because it gives an overlook of both downtown and the Hollywood sign. The Observatory was a surprise, I didn't know what it was on the inside, and I loved it! The gift shop was very nice. The bus is 50c up AND down the hill.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErylbyExplore
40,Good View,"This place had a wonderful view of the city of Los Angeles. It is colder here than downtown, so make sure to bring a jacket if you get cold easily.

50,Be sure to observe the Observatory,"I visit Los Angeles twice a year and every time I visit Griffith Park, from hiking ( give at least one trail a try) to the observatory to the Hollywood sign to the reservoir, the views priceless and spectacular, parking below which is easier, if you elect to park at the observatory get there early since it fills up very quickly, it's a must see or you have seen Hollywood at all",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wallyreidjr
50,A must visit,"We were lucky to see one of the beautiful sunset. The best time is around the sunsetParking - is a real challenge and the dash shuttle is too crowded but a good alternative.Evening telescope - the q cuts off at 9.30 pm and generally takes 40 minutes so plan accordinglyMuseum - a lot to learn or relearn about earth, moon, seasons",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caballero500
50,Ginormous park!,"If the earth could become a lush piece of greenery, then Griffith Park would be a good sample.The park houses many attractions and visitors are able to do sooooooooooooo much within it. Rather than me rambling on, best thing to do is see what they have to say - Unfortunately i can't link the PDF here from their official site but just search for ""griffith park info pdf"" and it should be the top link :)In summary, please do visit but do take heed of the park rules.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTwos

50,Outstanding views,"Huge beautiful park. Many hiking trails. We did the Mt Hollywood hike which I would totally recommend. Wonderful views of the city and the Hollywood sign as you hike. Took an Uber to the Griffith observatory parking lot which was the trail head, but had difficulty getting an Uber for our return to our hotel. Lots of traffic to parking lot, and we were there early before the Observatory had even opened.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rageisman
40,Great views of LA,"Very busy, but worth the drive to get some great views over the city. Would like to go back and do it at night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewKen
50,Best Thing in LA,"I'm shocked Griffith park isn't ranked in the top 5 for things to do in LA, it is easily the best place I went to when I visited.The park offers the best views of the Hollywood sign, but better yet the views of the city with the observatory in the foreground are absolutely stunning. There is a vast amount of trails in this park, including the trail to the Hollywood sign itself, and it can be quite easy to get lost. I ended up hiking to the top of Mount Hollywood, which was quite tiring on a hot day, but you need not go that far for exceptional views. Within just 30 minutes from the observatory you will be treated to amazing photo opportunities.I would advise anybody going here to take the Observatory Dash bus. The fee is only $0.35 each way and it drives all the way up to the observatory. The amount of people trying to park here was insane, with many having to park much further down the hill before hiking up to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AndrewK508
50,Nature and the heart of the city,"The last time I was in Griffin Park with well over 20 years ago as a kid, I was pleasantly surprised to see that is still very rustic and country like and the city has spent money on the Jean archery Museum the LA zoo the travel center and is kept up the park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nissan1515

40,Ferndell – An Oasis Before Griffith,"This little trail at the beginning of the road to Griffith Observatory was a delight for us. We visited several parks in the area, but this one was a relaxing oasis. A small stream ran through it and benches were near bridge walkways. For couples looking for a place to relax before going to the observatory, I recommend it for a romantic treat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joestuffsda
50,Awesome experience,"The park is great, very well mantained and plenty of people to help you to get around. It is very croweded during the day but we were lucky getting a park space by arriving early in the morning. The observatory is not to be missed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TulioBourbon
50,Spectacular view of LA,The is a pony and train rental place at the bottom. If you are not interested in this then please remember to continue to drive further upwards. Then you reach a parking place where walking trails starts. Trails have steep passages - but you are rewarded by a spectacular view over LA even after walking very shortly - we took the passage targeted for the old zoo - saw the was a lower track as well - we choose going upwards from the start.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/927hansk
40,"Great park - wonderful view, great for moderate walks or long hikes",This is a huge park above LA. Fantastic view of LA and areas. Hint - even if parking lot signs are full -drive up (the parking lot has high turnover) so never saw anyone not get a parking spot. Great place to just look over the city but terrific paths for walkers or hikers (parts are very steep). A must do in LA I my opinion.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nedelakttraveler

50,First time in LA? Be sure to come here.,"Visit the top of Mount Hollywood and the Griffith Observatory Do not drive! Take the shuttle bus for fifty cents from the Sunset and Vermont station. Door to door service rather than a long uphill hike. Even if you are not into astronomy, the view is spectacular. And if you are a budding astronomer, the movie presentation is excellent. Bring your own food. Cafeteria was out of food when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenjerliz
50,Best views,Very well kept park! Wonderful views of the city and Hollywood sign. Parking was free until noon on the day we visited.

40,Not bad for a free attraction,"It does not cost you a thing to come here and visit the famous Observatory, a landmark of Los Angeles. So you cannot set your expectations very high, nor you can complain after the visit. We have visited this place at least a dozen times. Finding parking is becoming more and more challenging, last time when we visited the place we could not find anything close so we turned around and went to beach instead.Lots of people! The observatory itself is not something very impressive, you can actually say it is a little disappointing, not too many things to see inside. But the surroundings are spectacular, you get the best views overlooking the city. It is one of the few places where you can take a very good picture of the Hollywood sign. Many people come here for hiking, the trails are easily accessible and offer you awesome views. Highly recommended for first time visitors!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller_12

We walked up the side stairs to get to the roof to look out. We didn't look around too much in the museum we had a few people with us who already been so we didn't take the time. It looked like it had so cool information. One thing I found fun was on the sidewalk, It has a location for the sun and then down the walk path there were the path and which planet and how far it gave us a visual which makes it even cooler. I it was so cool to see and enjoy the nature and city around you. Go and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Breanne07

50,Best view in LA,The Observatory Outside: If you can get up there on a day the smog is not to bad then it is the most beautiful view of Hollywood and LA you will ever see. The hiking trails that take you up the hill even higher are amazing and can even lead you to the Hollywood sign if you know how to get there.If you want something a little less dramatic you can always stroll through Ferndell along the stream or just run around the old zoo grounds. For fun you can take the kids to the merry-go-round which was always one of my favorites as an adult kid. There is also train town there for people who love very old American Heavy Metal. But if you are more the cow boy type there use to be a horse rental place that takes you all over the park on horse back. I am not sure if it is still there but it was a lot of fun for an afternoon.My favorite was going to the Observatory (inside). I lived down in Studio City for a short time and when ever I could I would go up there and play with all the displays and read all the info with wonder. It is great for science geeks and amateurs alike.If none of this sounds like your kind of thing there is always the Greek Theater. The theater there has seen countless famous performers from Harry Belafonte to Neil Diamond to the Indigo Girls. I had the chance to see some great concerts there on warm summer nights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fireangel616
50,Best views of the city!,"Must see in person! No review can justify the amazing views Griffith park offers! Day or night, you will be satisfied!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Smphillips53
50,"Day or Night, always worth the traffic","Griffith is one of my favorite parts of living in LA. There are two major things to do in the park: hike (including to the Wisdom Tree, or the Hollywood Sign) or visit the observatory. Both options have wonderful views.Parking can be tough to get, especially on weekends, so be sure to wear shoes suitable for walking, even if you aren't going on a hike - there's a likelihood that you'll have to park further down the road and walk up the hill to get to the observatory. I recommend eating beforehand or bringing a picnic (even if that just consists of in n out!) as I am not usually impressed by the food at the cafe in the observatory. It's decent, but why spend money on food I don't absolutely love? Especially in LA.I enjoy the view both during the daytime and at night, and would recommend both if you have several days. If you don't, I recommend visiting in the early morning to avoid the crowds and taking a hike as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/432gabrielles
50,Bike..Walk..Dash,If you want no hassle from the traffic and the crowded parking lot specially on weekends.I suggest you take the hiking trail or bike along the paved road . You can also take the public transport that runs every 20 minutes. The best view of Los Angeles during night time is here. It is worth the trip when you get here..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AikenJoshAndrew
40,Lovely,"I liked it so much. View was great especially in night. I love to sit there, in mute and noiseless and look at the busy city",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlfredS1511
40,Great Vista point for L.A.,"Came up here just before leaving L.A. It's the best view point to see all of L.A. However, if you want the Hollywood sign, you're better off going to Lake Hollywood park, as it is far off in the distance here. Plenty of parking, for a fee, or on the cuhrb for free as you go up the hill. Easy to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craig1086
40,"Great exercise, well maintained trails, gorgeous views","I hiked from Roosevelt's cafe (grabbed a sandwich for the trip) at the bottom up to the observatory then up to the top of Mt. Hollywood, and finally over to the Hollywood Sign. The sign is not on Mt. Hollywood, so if you are going to do one or the other, this is helpful to know. Once you leave the observatory there are no bathrooms or places to get water, so go at the observatory and take plenty of water with you. I recommend a bar or small snack as well. Bring a camera for fantastic photos. Wear comfortable walking shoes. Trails are a bit slick from dust, but otherwise, well maintained. Layer so that you can take things off when you get warm, but have a long sleeve ready for the times when the wind blows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/648maryd
40,Nice hike to the Bat Cave,"We had a good, short hike to Bronson Cave which is the Bat Cave from the original TV series. There is not a lot of parking and the port-o-potty is disgusting. Otherwise, good stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/boymomdfw
50,Equestrian Fun!,"Griffith Park is a magical place...full of opportunities to learn while having fun as you learn. Not only is there an Observatory for studying Planetary matters, but there is also an onsite Equestrian Center for renting and riding horses. If either of these two things don't interest someone, there's the option to simply going hiking through nature on one or several of the many trails within the park. Terrain is a bit robust so be sure to have plenty of bottled water on hand, along with sunscreen, bug repellent and a hat & sunglasses. Parking is sometimes limited, but is still free and easy to access. Parking is also allowed along the curbside on the main road leading up to the Observatory. Make a day of visiting Griffith Park soon!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rokce
40,Very Busy,A great park to visit also great views over LA from the top also good photo opportunity for the Hollywood sign . It was rammed packed on a Sunday in January we had to park near the theatre and walk up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lillyKent
50,Beautiful and very peaceful,Griffith Park is very beautiful and peaceful place to visit. We took a nice long stroll through the park. Definitely a must see if you are in town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RacquelvsKels
50,Beautiful,"My experience at griffith park was lovely. We don't have squirrels back home, and hoped to see them during our stay in the states.I could have watched them all afternoon. The park had plenty of tracks to explore, toilet facilities, seating and playground. I was very happy to have found it, and would recommend it as a nice relaxing outing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindapE2425ZI
40,Good Hike,"We hiked up and viewed the Hollywood sign and then back down. Probably a 40 min hike from where we parked up. I'm in decent shape and got a little winded, it's a steep hill. Great view of the Hollywood sign and of LA. I probably could have spent more time here hiking other trails. The trail system looked like they went on for miles! We were on a time crunch so didn't have all day to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suzikay1
50,Best view of LA,We came here to visit Griffith Observatory and the view both at sunset and at night was absolutely incredible.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S2172EKrebeccac
50,Over and over again,I just LOVE this place. It is kind of magical. Take a hike to the Griffith Park Observatory Trails Peak and enjoy the view! It is by far my favorite thing to do in busy LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Edalsworld
30,A nice piece of nature in a big city,"Wellyou haveto go in here on the way to the observatory or the hollywood sign. Butyou could see lots of walking paths, good for locals but not sure if tourists would be bothered",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Antinmelb
50,Massive fantastic park,"Griffith Park is a must visit in Los Angeles, not only is it home to the Griffith Observatory but it offers stunning views and scenery and some great walks. You can even get close to the Hollywood sign walking around here. It's best to plan what you want to do before you come here though as the park is so big that different areas have there own parking sections.By warned parking on busy days around this park is a complete nightmare so try and come at a quieter time if possible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JXXXR
50,Fits all your needs,"Great view, great walk, great observatory with interesting explication for all astral phenomenas.Fascinating for children as well as for adults.Watch the panorama of Los Angeles on the sun set what we did. We parked along the street and had the all .Was great even if we came back in the dark .Recommend as the must in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/krzy_k2015
40,Lots of trails,"Lots of trails snake through this park. Nice views of the Hollywood sign farther up. If this is a first visit for you, Make sure you study the map good so you don’t get lost. Also be sure to read all parking signs so you don’t get a parking ticket like we did. (No parking after sunset sign was missing.) As long as you leave before sunset, you could park for free and walk up to Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WilliamK487
50,A Must for LA,"There are so many things to do here. The trails are great but beware, there is not much shade for hiking. Be sure to check out the abandoned zoo, the Hollywood sign, and the view (night and day) of LA, the valley AND the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amberxapocalypse
30,Good City view from the observatory,Didn't have much parking space available for this park but i enjoyed the city views from this park. I was able to capture good city landscapes from here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/857srib
50,Awesome views,"amazing views of LA and the Hollywood sign, free to visit and beautiful would highly recommend visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lisacG4605RS
40,So much to see!,"This park is bigger than Central Park but it’s different.There are so many different things to do here. The history is so interesting and anyone who visits here should read up on it so you can appreciate it.Our little kids enjoyed the pony rides. We toured the abandoned zoo, which I could have spent hours there!! So interesting!!!We didn’t go to the LA Zoo. We just didn’t have time to do everything!We did go to the Autry Museum! Really great! Beautiful!Some of the areas of the park were a little scary and needed attention. We were there the end of January and the Christmas decor near the pony rides still had not been taken down. This area needs an update. Slightly trashy. It’s a state park, so this surprised me.The observatory is a must see! See my review for that separately.All in all a great place. But I’m a history buff. You could go here everyday for a month and not be satisfied that you’ve seen it all.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pof69er
50,What a place to hike!,This is a huge and fun place to hike...so many choices and places to go here. So many views and so much beauty. Highly recommend it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/452lesliee
50,Beautiful Park to Take In Sights & Hike,"This park offers great trails to hike and beautiful views of downtown Los Angeles. This park also has the Griffith Observatory that I feel is a ""must see"" if you visit the Los Angeles area. The best part about everything is it's free except parking. There is no entry fee for the park or the Observatory. At the Observatory there are fees to view a special exhibit or hear a speaker but overall everything is complimentary. The Observatory does offer a cafe and a gift store and wonderful views including the ""Hollywood"" sign.Depending on the time of your visit the traffic going up to the Observatory can be slow and bumper to bumper and the only criticism is finding a parking space and having to pay for parking (don't remember the charge) and you have to put the receipt on your dash in the vehicle.It's hard to say how much time you will spend up there because it depends if you hike or not or how long you take to view all of the exhibits in the Observatory but plan on at least a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelLong1963
50,Science Geek,Great place to go learn more about our universe! There are shows to watch and you get a great view of Los Angeles from the balconies!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CiruMwaniki
40,Challenging Hiking experience,"We started from the Canyon Drive entrance. First we visited the Bronson Caves. Then, after walking up slope for 2 miles we reached a view point below the Hollywood sign to take pictures. Then we continued upwards and reached the radio towers above the Hollywood sign. We did not stop there. We continued to ascend along a steep dirt trail to Cahuenga Peak and the Wisdom Tree, before returning.The hike was a wonderful experience. It was quite challenging for me but it is good for my health. Also, the view near Cahuenga Peak and the Wisdom Tree is wonderful, from which you can overlook a large area of LA. The condition of the trail is less than ideal since most of it is loose dirt, some mixed with horse waste and urine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPofHotels
50,The Only View of Los Angeles!,"We decided to go to Griffith Park on New Year's Day and wow! what a workout. We climbed the hill from the bottom (we are true hikers) to the observatory first. It was tough and it will test your limits - especially the more steep inclines, not to mention the WATCH OUT FOR RATTLESNAKES SIGNS - but well worth it. Bring lots of water and be prepared to be amazed at the views. The observatory was closed but at non-holiday time you can go in and see a planetarium type show. There are bathrooms at the top. Bring a picnic and enjoy with the older child family. Young ones may have problems climbing but you can always drive up to the observatory. We continued our climb to the peak and saw some breathtaking views not to mention amazing spots to take pictures of the HOLLYWOOD sign. Make it a must on your next trip - it will take you a half day approximately and it is FREE!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinekY2598NP
40,Center of Outdoor Activity,"Griffith Park is where much of LA residents go for outdoor activities. Within the park are outdoor music venues, running paths, picnic spots and more. It's a nice place to visit on your way up the hill to the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johninok
40,Great outdoors,"Few options to spend a day with family or hike, jog,.. The area could be a gem with more rain fall.I visited twice but dry grass with predominant. Nevertheless it is worth spending few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianB6495
40,Very nice area !,"With over 4,000 plus acres - plenty to do - largest urban park in America - take time to explore all facets from Observatory- bird sanctuaries- Theater - horse back riding and trails !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/352bobs
50,Amazing Views,Came at sunset and were treated to amazing views. Was very crowded trying to get up the hill but well worth it. A must do if you are in the area,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnc7200
50,So big you need to drive around it and hike in it,"Quite a few things to do here, pony rides for the kids, the merry go round, the Griffith park observatory, travel town and the L.A. Zoo. You just have to pick a place here that suits you interest for you, your friends and/or family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/esethebomb
50,Breathtaking views of LA and the sky!,"It was dark when I arrived, so I can't speak to how lovely the exterior is during the daylight, but the exhibits and the telescopes and layout were top notch. Oh, and the views of the greater LA basin were fantastic. I saw people of all ages and types enjoying the same great view that I was. There were a few ""mobile"" telescopes set up in the lawn that were attended by staff and the public could use to peer at heavenly bodies. There was a well appointed snack bar downstairs. There was also a designated pick up area for cabs and Ubers that was very helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryinOK
40,Go for a drive for an amazing view of the city,"As you drive up towards the observatory, you get an idea on how large LA really is. Park on the side of the road and head off for a hike, or follow the road to the end and visit the observatory.this park is huge and diverse which gives you so many options on what to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4509PPtimf

50,A stunner of a place!! Absolutely must see,"We went 2x! in a DAY :P yes, we went in the morning to see the Hollywood Sign and were very impressed with the Griffith Observatory - they even offer free public viewing from the telescope - TOP!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/syeda409
50,Great place for bikes,"I've ridden the Griffith Park loop a few times and really enjoyed it. Starting at the bottom by the LA Zoo you ride around the Roosevelt Golf Course up and over the hill along Grifith Park Dr. The hill is long and steep at the end but not too crazy. Then you have a long, fast descent to the Railroad Museum and back to the Zoo. Its a nice ride with a lot of great scenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregJ1964
50,Grandbaby the delights with the lights,Took my granddaughter there on the train light for the Christmas lights at Griffith Park had a wonderful experience. However this is a few things you need to know one you cannot buy tickets online. To get there at least an hour early there will be a long line to buy tickets and then you need to get in line for the train. It is on the chilly side so bundle up the little ones. The grandbaby and the family really had a great time well worth the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/920johnnyv
40,Great view. Gorgeous art deco building.,"I love every to do with astronomy and it doesn't get much better than the Griffith Observatory. Housed in a lovely, perfectly preserved art deco building. With a great view of the city and the Hollywood sign. Definitely worth a visit to both the observatory and the surrounding mammoth park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eric22754
50,Great place to visit.,Dash bus from Metro takes to the Observatory. Great views of LA on a clear day. A short walk towards the Greek Theater puts you on a bird watching trail up a canyon . Very good short walk. Loos at the start of it.All around you hikers are on trails. Dash bus back from Greek theater to Metro.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonyisleham
40,Not your average park.,"This is a huge oasis sort of at the edge LA. Entering from the south the park seems like wild canyons and hills and this includes the mt where the observatory is located. The eastern edge along the expressway is more traditional with golf courses, a zoo, picnic spots etc.Tip: bring some change to feed the telescopes for gazing out over the city. I plan on returning at night to see the city lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/702billh
50,Favorite Hiking Park,"Almost 70 miles of hiking paths in the wonderfully scenic and historic Griffith Park. Plenty of mixed trails , easy to difficult , and almost everyone provides “ sanctuary “ from cars, noise and the city. Views on the Pacific , and on some days , Santa Monica. Come the greening that happens due to rainy season , some of the trails will remind you of the land of the Hobbits...highly recommend getting a map and try a few trails...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmm2355
30,Beware of Heights,"Like most folks, I was excited to see the views, hike and get near the Hollywood sign. I was not prepared for the dramatic heights while driving up the narrow mountain to the observatory. I will certainly take a shuttle or tour the next time around. Otherwise, the experience was great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SassyTravels77
50,my sanctuary,"my favorite place in los angeles. you can send all day there and never get bored. there are pools tennis courts basketball courts, a carousel where walt disney sat, horses sunsets views the observatory. the list goes on. perfect for a family a date or just to go and hang out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IsaiahMichel
50,What a view,We wanted to get close to the 'Hollywood' sign and oh boy did we!! the walk is easy and worth every moment getting to the top and to be within feet of the Hollywood sign was very special. The view all the way was spectacular...we got to the top just on sunset and was very magical but it's not a walk to do in the dark! so make sure you give yourself enough time to get down. You can do this climb by horse if you wish.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savannahaustralia
50,Great hike and view,"Try to go early for best views and if you can spare the time, hit the observatory as well. Beautiful LA landmark.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureensU1084SS
30,Well Known LA Park,"This park is well known by many residents of LA. It offers a green space to get away from the city for a picnic, walk, movie night (check event listings), theater (check listings), or to just relax. In comparison to other LA parks I would rate this as one of the better ones. But since this is Trip Advisor and for travelers, when comparing it to all the beautiful parks throughout the world, that's why I rated it as average. This is not one of those parks you drive to a city just to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NeoNorth

40,Bird eye view of LA,"To visit this park, you need either uber or to travel on foot. I walked all the way from LA red line metro to griffith park and it took me 30 minutes (2 miles walk). Park is very well maintained and it gives a bird eye view of LA. A must visit place in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UsamaPerwez
50,Great view of Los Angeles (if it's not smoggy),This was part of a half day city tour. A great place to see the iconic Hollywood sign. Unfortunately is was terribly smoggy the day we were there but it was still a nice experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runnerrae
50,Worth the effort,"On a beautiful hot day we walked to Griffith Park. We expected signage to guide us there, but sadly, no. It seems in LA for those who choose to bike or walk their way around the city you need to consult a map...anyway, we made it to the right entrance almost by chance and then enjoyed the long hot walk up to the Observatory. It is worth the effort, the views across the city are memorizing, even with the evidence of some smog.We didn't get to see any rattlesnakes, despite the warning sign, but did enjoy getting fairly close to a squirrel who was enjoying a nut snack as we wandered by.The many trails offer hours of exercise and a chance to enjoy this wonderful park. If possible, don't drive into the park...take the opportunity to walk or bike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SusieCarlucci2015

50,One of the best views I've ever seen,One of the reasons I'm jealous of people living in LA is that they can get to Griffith park whenever they want! The view is great and the park is really good if you are interested in hiking or running. If you are visiting LA (like I was) this place is not to be missed!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tommy_Apostolidis
50,"Great park, closed on Mondays, but still worth the visit","We loved this park- the views of LA, Hollywood sign, and beach were amazing! We went on a Monday when the Griffith Observatory is closed, but turns out I think Monday is a good day to go, because less traffic getting around, easy to park, less crowds at the observatory so we could get some cool pictures/ video. Looked like a nice park for hiking as well, but we didn't have a lot of time. Would go again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/163kerid
50,Awesome View,"Aside of being historical observatory, the view is fantastic and breathtaking. Planning to go back there at night to try those big telescope and see the beauty of the skies! Thumbs up!! Make sure you have a car it’s quite far. It’s on the Top 😂",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sheuk_Miming
50,Don't miss this view !,A must if you want a fabulous view of LA and its surroundings-stunning at night as well and the observatory is fascinating. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesonf210
50,Run / hike trails galore,I ran about 3 hours here and it was fantastic ! I recommend parking at visitor center and getting a trial map. There isn’t much water so bring a camelback or bottle water to refill. They have water fountains but you have to plan a little bit. There are porta Potty’s in main park areas with some flat dirt trails to run. No bathrooms on hard hikes so bring a poopy bag! Tons of trash cans. Wonderful views!!!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katravler

50,Night dream,"If you are romantic you should go there and see the city from the top of the world, like in La La Land.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlOfTerezKorut
40,Don’t go on a weekend!,"If you want to go to Griffith Park, and especially up to the observatory, do it on a weekday. But beware, the observatory is closed on certain days. We tried to go there on a Sunday and it was a mad house. There was literally no parking and the park police were having people drive right on through and exit. There were no good options.So we went back on Monday. There was parking and the views were great but the observatory was closed. We did not know that would be a thing. We did not even check if it had days it wouldn’t be open.So for the logistical nightmare I would give this a 0, but on a normal day when you can park and walk around and see the views, it warrants a 4 simply for awesomeness and uniqueness.I cannot comment on the observatory since it was closed. The parking was easy. It is pay parking up at the observatory.If you are in LA you should not pass this up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dshochet
40,Great running paths,We stayed by Griffith Park during our stay in LA. It’s pretty tough finding time to run but with paths like these it’s actually a fun part of the vacation. Felt safe during the morning hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xamers
50,Amazing views of the city,"I had never been to Los Angeles before and I can say that of everything I saw, Griffith Park was my absolute favorite. It offers stunning views of the city (on a clear day) and has wonderful hiking. Of course the Griffith Observatory is just as cool. I’m a photographer, and I just went crazy with my camera because the view was constantly changing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjvieth

50,Big oasis in the city,"Lots here with the Autry museum, zoo, many trails, Griffith observatory. Don't forget the merry-go-round near the ranger station. Operating on weekends and a few other days - even has old time music: both the young and young-at-heart will enjoy it! Treats for sale too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brwerner
40,Huge park with fantastic wide trails,This is a great park with lots of opportunities for walking and cycling with play areas and other activities for younger children. You will either need a car or to have researched what you want to do here before you set out to get best benefit. The easiest hike to the Hollywood sign is probably from the observatory about 4 miles. You will need to arrive early to get a parking space at the observatory or face a further 1 mile uphill walk from the Greek theatre if you aim is the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
50,Great Views on a Clear Day,"Griffith Park is a perfect place for a run, walk or hike. Wear the appropriate shoes, pack water and let another know that you’re off on an exclusion. I’ve found that letting little kids run around on the grass is great for some outdoor time. Then, there is the observatory!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProfAragon
50,Bit of a hike but worth it in the end,"Griffith Park is absolutely huge and there is so much to explore. If you have a car there is various parking available but it comes at a price. We saw one for $2 every 15 minutes.If you walk up from Hollywood it may take a while as there are some steep sections but is worth it fir the experience. The nearest metro for Griffith Observatory is probably Vermont/Sunset and will take about an hour to walk up. There is a supermarket on Franklin Avenue for drinks etc. And there is a cafe just before the entrance to the park.The views are so worth it.

50,Ready for nature?,Griffith park offers a bunch of really cool trails and stuff. It’s a great place to go on a hike or have a picnic. The observatory is close too so you can also stop by if you want to see some cool aliens and stuff. 10/10.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knighttimedragon
50,An amazing experience!,"Loved all the educational exhibits, shows, scenery and ambiance. What a wonderful observatory! I would definitely go back again as there is so much to see and do. I loved seeing the Tesla coil demonstration.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chipski
40,A fantastic break from the hustle and bustle of LA,"We tried twice to get up to the Observatory to watch the sunset, but both days we ended up in grid locked traffic and ended up having to walk a fair bit of the way up - no biggie, but we never made it up in time to see the sunset - I guess we'll have to do that next time we're in LA.But I really liked Griffith Park, it's an oasis right in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of LA, my favorite part was probably Amir's Garden though - a tranquil garden on top of one of the hills, with beautiful flowers and humming birds buzzing around. It's a small hike up there, but it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredrikedvardsen
50,Great & must see during LA trip,"Went with family on a Sunday afternoon, was patient and found parking at the top. The view of the city & Hollywood sign were great as was the Observatory. Live view of the Sun & some great exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bfallona
50,"Great place for couples, groups, picnics, hikes",Nice hiking trails- pretty moderate when it comes to how strenuous they can be. You can start at the bottom and hike all the way to the Observatory. Or you can drive in and have a picnic at many of the picnic tables scattered around. It's a huge place with many points of entry. Look at a map to see all the options!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaraS1299
20,Total Trafic-jam,"We planned to visit the observatory late afternoon. And It became a living trafic hell.

50,Get a local's view of LA,"The largest urban park in the US, if not in the world with many hiking trails.

Lee and the Hollywood Sign",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamS967

Especially during the later afternoon/evening. Same for the weekends. there is no fee to enter the observatory.... awesome views, you can see DTLA/Hollywood and the Hollywood sign is behind you/K-Town/West LA from the Observatory. You can roam all around the different levels of the observatory. if you go later on at night, there may be parking spaces opening up at the very top... but depending on the night, the parking attendants may not let you drive up that far. dress comfortably.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GSWRD510

50,Real Tribute to 'Griffith',"Had read about J.Griffith's contribution of 3000 acres of land to the park in 1896. Felt like offering 'Real Tributes' to such a personality. With his foresight, today it holds an Amphitheater, Observatory & a Planetarium too. It has witnessed four major fire accidents in 1933, 1961, 1971, 2007. Even if we remember these aspects on visiting the 'Griffith Park'; It would be a tribute to #Great Souls#",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cshastry2
30,Beautiful views,.. but slow busses. It wasn't clear that you could park at the top. Therefore we parked at the Greek Theatre and took the bus to the top. However the line was long and there were not enough busses. There was even a traffic jam. It would be better to make sure the busses get priority lanes or something similar to get faster up top and back down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tanneboga
50,One of the largest city parks in America,"Named after the man who donated the land, this is a beautiful park which separates Los Angeles from the San Fernando Valley.

It is a good place to take the children, or where you can get some peace and quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/484karlc
50,Everlasting gobstopper of a park,Everlasting gobstopper of a park. Something for all and individual treats throughout Griffith Park. Great hiking and one of the best bike rides in Los Angeles goes from the Planetarium to Travel Town. The hippie love ins were on the Merrygo Round meadow and the abandoned zoo is now simply a place to eearily explore. The new zoo is a hidden gem that few seem to have embraced. The Audrey museum is another place that has yet to capture the publics imagination.If Griffith Park were in New York it would be embraced in the same fashion as Central park. Los Angeles has yet to view it as a whole rather than a collection of small parts.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad

50,"Awesome Hike, Better Views","Hiking at Griffith Park was one of the more surprising highlights of my trip to LA. We decided to hike the trail shortly after I got off the plane so I could see a good view of the city and the Hollywood sign and it definitely did the trick.The drive up to Griffith Park was beautiful! The homes were stunning and was a very lush oasis in an otherwise desert arid climate.The hike we chose was the most difficult path, but while it was tough going up, the view at the top was its own reward! We were treated with a panoramic view of LA and a close up look at the Hollywood sign. It's even above the Griffith observatory, which I would like to stop off at next time.Overall a great hike for a novice hiker looking for a unique adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978nicolea
50,"dream as seen on new stations, movies, etc","although I didn't get to fully enjoy the telescope, I did enjoy the the views and just being there gave me goosebumps. I happen to have had my bicycle in the car, so found me a quick parking spot, which kindly enough, the people leaving gave me their parking receipt for a few more hours, so I paid it forward by giving them a few dollars, and passed on the receipt to others when I left.....but back to the bicycle: I rode up the rest of the hill and was in complete awe. *an extra: The Greek Theater at the bottom of the hill exiting the Park. big fan of all concerts/music held there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pico26

50,Sunset Time to Go,"I took a hike up here with my friend and was so pleased with the walking trails as well as the overall view from the observatory. It can get steep in places, but I saw that there was actually a road to drive up! So it is good for people of all ages. I'd highly recommend coming up for sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SammiDeRosa
50,OMG I love this place!,"Due to jet lag we arrived to the park early morning around 7am. It was a glorious day, very sunny and later on pretty hot. We hiked a couple of different trails. We also went to see the back of the Hollywood sign (which wasn't worth it).The park gives you wonderful views and it is very relaxing and beautiful out there. I hope I will be able to come back.

50,Beautiful Sunset Location,Wow - it's worth the effort getting up here and finding a place to park for stunning sunset. The views over LA are incredible with the setting sun behind you. It will get cold so bring a jumper! And don't expect to see lots of stars - unless you're watching one of the movies in the planetarium. A great place for timelapse photography as day turns to night. If it's a concert night at The Greek be prepared for even more traffic and access to the Observatory may only be via one route - we found this out the hard way!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SLCNKH
50,Amazing place in Griffith park,"Absolutely amazing Autry museum of the American West located in Griffith park is an obligatory must see in LA!!! Please, dont waist your time and money for primitive museums on Hollywood bd, this is even not a poor copy of the original Tusso's and Guiness museums, but AUTRY will excite you with the first minutes of your visit. You will see the unique collections of costumes from legendary films, old luxury guns, handcrafted masterpices, and a lot of other amazing things, including special exhibition dedicated to the 20th century toys:) Also I'll recommend this place for families with children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TYur
50,"Beautiful overlook, plan to arrive at 11:30","The views from the Griffith Observatory balcony are stunning, the exhibition is very intelligently arranged -- interesting and not at all childish or simplistic. I think that for younger children, the science-oriented exhibition probably goes beyond their grasp. It's much more suitable for older kids and teenagers.The two planetarium shows were WONDERFUL. With a live-person narrating the 45 minute shows skillfully, interestingly, and with a beautiful voice and sense of accurate drama.The box office opens at noon, and the place gets VERY crowded. Plan on arriving early, parking your car at 11:30 tops (parking can become an issue -- you'll need to park far away and walk up the hill for a while). In the high season (summer), if you arrive at, say, 14:00 in the afternoon, the planetarium shows will be sold out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MayaM792

50,Beautiful view of LA & Hollywood Sign,"Went to Griffith Park for the view of the Hollywood sign and the view did not disappoint. This is a popular location, so getting to the top of the mountain by car takes some time. If you're not there first thing in the morning you will likely have to park further down the mountain and then walk up towards the Observatory for the views. The walk can be long and hot, but it's worth it. Note that you have to pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinedm23
40,Hiking Trails,"Griffith Park has a variety of hiking trails, throughout the park. The area near the Observatory has trails that wind through the hills, with spectacular views of the city below. Near the golf course and the Zoo, the trails climb into the hills that give views of the Los Angeles River, Glendale, and Burbank. Be sure to bring water, and check the map at the trailhead for an estimate of the hiking ability necessary and directions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasH_traveling

50,"Beautiful, be wary of parking!","Absolutely amazing views for sightseeing and photography. It's gorgeous. I'd recommend for anyone visiting LA. Be wary of parking though- I got a 95 dollar ticket for parking on the side of the road. There weren't any signs- it gets crowded with vehicles.

40,Park surrounding the observatory,"Whilst the observatory probably is a lot more interesting, the park surrounding the observatory is also very nice. If you want to take the hike up through the park, use the ample parking at the entrance of the park and take the hike up. Parking up at the observatory is very limited, and recently they changed it all in a one-way circular system, which increases the flow of traffic, but it makes it a lot harder finding a spot by driving up and down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThomasEMM

50,Breathtaking views and an exciting observatory tour,"We were amazed by the breathtaking view we got of the city up at the observatory, to top it off we also got to enjoy a beautiful sunset next to the Hollywood sign. In the observatory you can get exciting facts about our solar system. And be sure not to miss the movie in the Leonard Nimoy Event Horizon theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeppe_07
40,Beautiful landmark with stunning views,We took the shuttle bus up to the observatory for a taste of LaLa Land. Brilliant views over the city and a nice cafe to sit and soak up the atmosphere. Only downside was volume of traffic causing congestion and delays getting up to the summit and back but worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cab726

50,Best City Park in the United States for 100 Reasons,"As someone who's visited Griffith Park literally hundreds of times since 1967, I had to make mention of ""Angelenos' backyard"" at least to post a photo or two. So much to see and do, including its famous hiking trails and historical sites -- if you haven't been, I recommend starting with a short stop at Ferndell then proceeding up to the Observatory. Then consult any online guide to get directions to its other treasures: The carousel, pony rides, Disney's barn, Travel Town, LA Live Steamers, Bee Rock, the Hogback trail, Dante's View, Amir's Garden (try to ignore the surly caretaker), the soccer fields, Autry Museum, LA Zoo, the Old Zoo (non-natives love to write about this ""secret"" ""hidden"" landmark ad nauseum, but natives know it's hardly secret, and it's sitting in plain sight just west of the Crystal Springs playground.) Visit Los Angeles Resident Tourist on Facebook for actual hidden sites, additional photos and tips. Thanks!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalRambler
50,Always worth the drive,There's so much to see and do at Griffith Park.You can go here to catch a show at the Greek Theater. You also go here to visit the Observatory and check out amazing views of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. You can go here with kids for pony rides. You can also check out the old zoo and take some creative photos. You can come to different parts of the park to try different hiking trails including several that leads you to the Hollywood sign. I think there's a summer camp and a ranch here as well.Totally worth a visit and a treasured LA landmark.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadarien
50,For Angelenos and tourists alike,"Loved our drive through the park, great scenery (several movies have shot scenes there). Our tour only drove up to Griffith Observatory and back down -- would love to have stayed longer and learned more about the ecology.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fivecontinents5
50,Beautiful Oasis with Easy Access,This is a great place for a picnic and hiking. Let the kids run. It is in the canyon so the scenery is very close in and natural as opposed to the Observatory above which carries wide expansive views of the city. Easy access and parking compared to the observatory on weekends.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seashark7
40,IF YOU LIKE RUNNING,"I have been running up the hill to the Observatory two times, for me was a tough one, from LA city up to the Observatory is over 200 meters... not bad. Then once you arrive at the top you feel you have reached a good target and you can see the all city from above, pretty extroversion. Try yourself!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matteo80adami
40,Escape from the city IN the city,"Like New York's Central Park, Griffith Park isn't a place where you can breeze through the whole place in an hour. It's an urban oasis with flora, fauna, assorted hikes and strolls, a great zoo, children's activities galore and plenty of space to plop down a blanket, open your picnic basket and catch the breeze or some rays.

Unfortunately, our most recent trip put us there on a Sunday and it was impossible to find parking for the observatory. We would have had to park miles down the road and hike uphill to get there.

40,So Much To See & Do!,"Griffith Park is a huge park right in the middle of the city. There are a lot of different things to do there depending on interest and ability. One can easily spend 2-3 days exploring. We spend 2 days in May visiting the observatory, zoo, Travel Town and Walt's Barn. In addition to these attractions there are also miles of hiking trails, pony rides, golf, and picnic areas. The Autry Museum features exhibits about the history of the Western U.S. You can rent a bicycle or take a train or carousel ride. Admission to the park is free and so are many of the attractions. Check the website before you go because the different activities have varying hours. It's well worth the visit - just be aware (as others have noted) that parking can be a challenge. We did not have any trouble parking at the zoo and Travel Town (we arrived at both just prior to opening), but the observatory was another matter. We did manage to get a parking space and see it (8:30 on Saturday morning) but it was congested and traffic was slow. Consider taking public transportation if possible - there's a bus that goes to the Greek Theatre and the Observatory from the Vermont/Sunset Metro Station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CrankingChick
50,A MUST if you're in LA!,"I was in LA for a few days and really only had time for one good hike; so after some research it seemed Griffith Park was my best bet. Considering the Observatory at the top of the mountain (GO THERE TOO!) was also on my list of things to do it made the decision pretty easy. I'm a pretty new hiker so I was weary to do the hike alone however I said screw it and took the Western Observatory trail. WOW! Such gorgeous views of LA the whole hike and it was nowhere near as crowded as other reviews warned. Overall it was pretty physically demanding but as a young guy I didn't have much trouble making my way to the top. I imagine this would be an awesome hike with some friends or a significant other, so I plan on returning with more people :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sammeir

30,Crowded!,"First, this attraction is free. Second, because it is free, it is very, VERY crowded. Traffic was like a slug on ice, and parking was like winning the lottery: you have a chance, but not a good one. And while the grounds are free, parking is not. There is a four-hour minimum fee, even if you only plan on sticking around an hour or so. So that's where they stick it to you: $16 bucks. Ouch.As far the actual place goes, it's iconic and offers some of the best views of LA. So bring a camera. As for the observatory itself, it's just okay. Many of the exhibits were dated or not working at all. And because of the crowds, we were lucky just to get to a few of them. In all fairness, we went on a Sunday; which was probably a bad idea.Still, the views are great, so check them out. Just be prepared to face the standstill traffic. Welcome to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlackCat307
50,The hike!,"So worth coming to this park! It was a very challenging climb because we are not used to hills, so be prepared and bring lots of water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/213elsaj
50,The views!,This park is a major tourist spot but it is worth going because the views are so awesome! The observatory is closed on Monday so try to go then since the crowds are manageable and you can get a parking space. Good spot to see the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221lindag
40,Personal Hike,"When coming to LA I knew I want to hike Griffith park. The park is not hard to find with GPS. The hike was everything I thought and more. The views of the Hollywood sign were an added treat. The bathrooms are a bit ""used"" but with the amount of people using them I guess that is to be understood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618tashah
40,Looked great - sorry didn't have time to enjoy more,"Drove through Griffith Park en route to Griffith Observatory near top of mountain. Impressed with hiking and biking paths. Very impressed with foresight of Griffith to donate 3000+ acres so many years ago to enable such a great park, now in the middle of L.A. metro-plex.And it's FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaroonDawg67
50,Marvelous Sunset and the Holly Wood Sign,Went there for sunset - the drive was quite a long one (keep going uphill takes plenty of time).Reached at approx 7pm (sunset at 8pm-ish) yet its super struggle to get a parking spot. Have reshuffle a few loops to get one spot.The view was magnificent - you just can say no to that. and a tiny 'hollwood' logo will be spotted around the sunset area.Totally worth the drive and the time. Just a bit chilly up there.Make sure you go probably 2hrs before to make sure you get to park your car. The road is kinda one way (in a loop) so you may have to make couple loops if you don't have space to park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/giligulu2016
50,Great views,We hiked up the Cahuenga trail to the wisdom tree and then to the backside of the Hollywood sign. It was amazing!! Highly recommend @RangerTedLA_ to lead you on this hike if you're not a hiker.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/noslenf
50,Amazing views - an absolute must,The views were incredible - the Hollywood sign and the vastness that is Los Angeles. Lovely spot away from the busyness of the city - wish we had had longer to enjoy the trails. Parking a bit of a challenge but you should persist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyandSarahG
30,"Great views, interesting drive ALWAYS crowded",I have been several times on different days of the week and different seasons. It is always crowded. Everyone is trying to get to the Observatory or to see the Hollywood Sign (see it from Canyon Lake where less crowded) so traffic is bad. The park is nice place to relax and kick back if you can get a place to park. There are some spots in the park with amazing views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbbyers67
40,amazing views...,This place is one of the best attractions of LA.

50,LA's Awesome Premier Park!,"Having gone to Griffith Park since I was a little girl, it holds a special place in my heart. So many things to see and recreational opportunities abound! First, and probably the most well-known is the LA Zoo. It's a wonderful, modern zoo, with so many animals to see. Young children and the young-at-heart will enjoy a visit here. There are a number of hills, so taking a tram ride may be in order.Other things to do include golf, horseback riding at the equestrian center (where I spent many a Saturday a.m. riding as a youngster and teen), and even watching the local rugby teams, Plenty of places to picnic, walk and hike, play ball, and explore. (You need to be careful as there is wildlife living in the hills.)What would a summer's evening be like without taking in a concert at the Greek Theater? A really nice venue with a modern sound system, smaller than the Hollywood Bowl. Nestled within the pine trees, it's a terrific ""smaller"" venue (compared to Dodger Stadium, unless you want to take in a game), and the Forum or Staples Center. Check the schedule online and you can even buy tickets as well.There are plenty of other attractions as well: The carousel, and Travel Town, and if you take a hop across the Ventura Fwy, you can visit the Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.If you're in the LA area around Christmastime, you can thrill at the driving tour of Griffith Park with their spectacular light displays. Fantastic, but be prepared to ""take your time"", as you'll be there with many other visitors, along with people from the LA Metro area who also want to see what's become a holiday tradition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lab-girl666
50,The view is amazing,"Standing at this lookout, you can really appreciate the scale of Los Angeles. It's nice to see the sun go down and the lights start to illuminate the sky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fancypantsdancer2009

50,Good Hike,Griffith Park is extremely beautiful! I knew that this was a must visit when I visited LA for the first time in January 2017. There is so much space for hiking and adventures. You can also see the Hollywood Sign in good view from the top!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AbundantLove

20,Nightmare Park,I wanted to see the Hollywood sign and read that this would be a good place to go to see it - we headed there after dinner on May 13th - what a nightmare - the traffic was HORRIBLE and the people directing traffic seemed to have no control or idea what they were doing . . . there was a concert at the Greek that evening - so I figured that could be why traffic was backed up - took us over an hr. to get to the top and by then it was dark so you could not even see the Hollywood sign . . . when we asked where to park - we were told it was like this EVERY night because people come there to see the lights of LA - not worth it to me,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donnalee014
50,Great surprise to find Pony Rides,"Taking a drive through Griffith Park with grandkids and found ""Pony Rides""!! What a treat!! We were there during the week and no lines.

20,You have to be in good health,The trails are steep and long. These trails are for hikers. They are dirt trails over hills. At the start of the trail they have nice bathrooms. No food or drinks near by you have to go back toward the residential neighborhood. Not very much parking and in some places you have to pay the meter for 4 hrs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tonda3546
50,"Respite from Elvis, Marilyn and Chewbacca","While in Hollywood on business, took a side trip to Griffith park. Hiked the path from near the Greek Theater to the top of Mt. Hollywood and then down to the observatory.This was a great and welcome break from the tinsel and crazy of Hollywood blvd.The guide told us about the history of the park and the Griffith family and pointed out distant items in the spectacular vistas.Watch for actors as you go. A gal in our group said that a jogger who passed us (twice) was the lead in one of her favorite TV shows. The guide had a long list of stars she has seen on the trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/timiniowa
50,I can see why James Dean came here!,Now it use to be that this place was run down and stuck in some sort of 1950's educational time warp. But now it has had a huge influx of money and ideas.

50,Very nicely done,You should definitely check this out.It is insightful. You learn alot about everything that has to do with the observatory. From the telescopes they use to the stars and the whole history between them.It was only 7$ for a ticket for the planetarium show and best 7$ spend! The lady who told the story did it with such charm that you could listen to her for hours!Nice views too!Only minor negative point was the parking that felt a bit chaotic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kdw452

So bonus for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Natyip

50,Amazing views!,"Sadly the day we went the observatory itself was closed (Monday) but the amazing views of LA and the Hollywood sign were well worth the drive. Be warned though, even though the observatory was closed, parking and traffic was a bit manic, so I can only imagine what it was like on days the observatory is open. Parking is time regulated though, so in the end, we didn't have too much trouble or long to wait before we got a park. Bring your binoculars and cameras with a zoom lens! Awesome views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Caroline4559

30,Both Natural & Manicured with Many Activities,"Griffith Park is different than most big city parks in that it has many areas that are natural/rustic without being beautifully, artificially landscaped. If you are looking for something like New York's Central Park this is not it.There are many, many different activities including: an area for pony rides, small trains, big trains, picnics, Fern Del which is a fairly short landscaped trail with a brook running through the center, a public golf course, The Los Angeles Zoo, as well as the Griffith Observatory and the famous outdoor Greek Theatre (it's a smaller version of the Hollywood Bowl). There are miles & miles of walking trails.This park is HUGE and you will not be able to walk the entire park. If you only have time to do one thing it would probably be to visit the Observatory which the drive up the mountain is a thrill ride by itself!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016
50,Refreshing Hike,I am a hiker and always looking for a good trail. Griffith Park has many to offer and each with amazing views.

50,One of my favorite places for hiking,"True, there are many places in and around LA that are more distinctive, more secluded. less crowded. But the trails around Grifith Park can be reached in minutes from Hollywood or the Valley, meaning that you can take advantage of a spur-of-the moment adventure. Look online ahead of time for trail maps, and you can choose what you're in the mood for: views of the observatory, the Hollywood sign, Catalina (on a clear day), the old zoo, the Angeles Mountains. Even hidden gems like Ameer's Garden. From easy to fairly strenuous, there's something for everyone. With all the rain this winter, the park is unusually lush and beautiful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChristopherN863

50,"DTLA , Sunset, and Sunrise views, not to mention a great walk in nature.","A great park to rival the magnificent Central Park in New York City.It is a bit more difficult to walk into the park for the best views. You can take the trails, or drive to points and see the best views that Los Angeles offers. Worth a stop for tourist photos, if there is no smog.

50,Nice outdoor location for LA,"With many attractions within the Park, such as the zoo and the observatory and a big playground for kids, the place is the only location which offers a touch of wilderness within the city. There are nice trails and abundant parking. Good for a full day excursion!",
50,A view to die for,"Seeing Los Angeles by night from the Griffith Park Observatory is a life changing experience. The entire city is lit up for as far as you can see, and if the stars are out, the view is truly magical.Ignore the observatory, and just soak up the view. Obviously, you need to bring a camera.",
40,Sunset Ranch,"Had an afternoon ride with GeorgeAnn. Me and my three girls went for an hour ride and had a great time. Saw the Hollywood sign and some highlights of Griffith Park. All of us were novice riders and had horses with good temperment. She helped us with pictures and had to stop when my daughter dropped her camera. Easy ride, recommended for beginners.",

It's quite far from the center, so me and my friends drove there as we had rented a car for the trip. (tip: LA is reallllyyyyy big, and things are quite far from each other, it might be worth renting a car). It's also a nice place to hiking, but... don't attempt to walk from there to the Hollywood sign!(i speak for experience, ahaha). it's really far and you can only see it from a great distance, even though I had walked quite a lot!:'D worth a visit and to spend the morning :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anamafalda8

There is paid parking available by the entrance. When we went, the paid parking area was closed off even though there were plenty of spots available.

If you have arrived up to here to view the city from above, the Hollywood sign, the breathtaking views, do not miss the opportunity to take a ride in the park. A tip can also be the one to walk up the dirt road that goes from the foot of the hill up to the observatory, but given the climate of this city, I recommend dressing properly.

They have a wall that has samples from the entire periodic table. Cool to see it in person and not just in a book.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dannymY6769KB
50,"Excellent hike with kids, but it is only stroller friendly to some extent","Griffith Park is charming with trails across the park so you get to see different angles of LA. Enough has been said about the park so I'll focus on hiking it with kids.We read online where some websites commented that Griffith Park is stroller friendly: to a small extent it is, but only if you are thinking about some simple strolls around Griffith Observatory, or if you are walking by the roads back into town. The rest of the park trails are narrow and steep - certainly not stroller friendly.Shane's Inspiration, south of the zoo and golf course, is a spacious and breezy playground area for kids. If you drive, it's worth dropping by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WeeKee
50,My Grandmother knew Griffith.,Grandfather also but died 31 years before I was born. I went everywhere in that vast park starting as a pre teen and I'm 71 now. My wife & myself went often after we were married. The park covers more than just one single thing. The last time back there was in the month of June in ((2009 not 2016)). That was 4 years since my retirement. Our 50-State Quest ended in 2005. Living up north now we did make our only trip to Southern California to catch up on past memories then. The park was just one of them but well worth the time even if we did it so many times. Cross the street from the entrance is a wonderful fountain seen by day or even better at night. As you drive by even if you don't plan to enter you see the kiddy train that is always running with those small ones. It may be the main entrance but if you study the map you will see other ways to enter. I have done those a lot too. Inside you can see the new zoo done over after my early years. The Merry Go Round is older than me good for all ages. The well know Observatory is worth the time it was in my early years and older too. You will see that in many movies over the years. The Gene Autry Museum isn't as old as other well know stops. My niece has work there for a few years. Fern Del Park is very impressing now and even growing up. That is nice to stroll by the stream that runs along the pathway. Following the road up from their it does enter the parka different way. But if you don't do anything else just the drive in & out along the hills is a great way to see the countryside or the far distance of Hollywood. Again night views are pretty. But I would have to rate Travel Town as my favorite that began in my early years. Anyone can come in and jump on & off all the trains as well as a bunch of cars. The museum for the town is good to see. Today they have a train you can ride both kids & their folks. Doesn't go far but it is fun. Then you can see how big the park really is that was left to the city by Griffith. Back to my Grandmother she did say that it was given free only with the understanding it was to always be free to the public. That's not true today and I wonder how that is possible. Granny & Griffith would turn in their graves if they could. But in any case this will always rate a 5-star with me. And it is a must see for you.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaduckcoin
40,Nice big natural area near bustling LA,"When you drive into Griffith Park it's hard to believe you're just a few miles away from Hollywood Blvd and all of the sounds of the people and sounds that go with them. This is a large natural area with nice areas for walking and some good parks for kids. We spent a couple of hours at Shane's Inspiration, a playground that is good for able-bodied and handicapped kiddos alike. We let the kids play, had a picnic lunch, and watched the Acorn Woodpeckers beating up the trees. There were several other families around on a weekday and the kids enjoyed playing together. Not a typical place to visit when in LA, but one of the highlights from our trip in terms of quality time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zdufran
50,So much to explore with small children!,"We visited with four adults and three small children. We were headed to the observatory, but stubled upon the greater park.

50,Great place to view landscape of LA,"I think the movie ""La La Land"" made this place more famous than before, and it also made me want to see this place. We came in the afternoon. It needed lots of effort to reach the place because we had to walk from the parking site uphill to the site. When we reached the site, it was like a reward because it was beautiful and really soothed the eyes to see the whole landscape of LA. From one side we could see the Hollywood Sign and from the other side we could see downtown LA.We spent a lot of time there, from afternoon and waiting until sunset came which was so amazing! Really enjoyed those moments...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlbertNoers
50,What a View,"The view was beautiful from every direction. We could see all of Los Angeles, take a great picture with the Hollywood Sign in the background, and enjoy nature.

50,Cool Free Place,"We went to find the old abandoned Griffith Zoo which closed in 1966. We found it and it's super creepy and interesting. There's old cages and caves to explore plus hiking.

50,"Great Hike, A Must Do in LA","I came solo to the park on a beautiful Friday morning and grabbed some quick food from The Trails Cafe in the park before setting off on the hike to the Observatory. Definitely recommend this - it wasn't too bad of a hike, just challenging enough for an amateur hiker like me and the views are spectacular. Lots of great areas to take a look at the city and once you get to the top at the Observatory, head to the balcony and take in that spectacular LA view. There is an option of a more difficult trail at the beginning of the hike, so if you're looking for a more challenging option, there is one available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marianasunc

50,The park for dreamers~,Walt Disney would go here to dream up new stories of mice and men. He did a great job following through on those imaginations. I go to Griffith Park to dream and write just like Walt and you can feel that magic vibe he was able to tune into. It's a Hollywood thing.

50,Lovely park with incredible views from the observatory,"This lovely open space is within an easy drive of Hollywood and other LA attractions.

Do yourself a favor and get going to Griffith Park - the largest, most ""natural"" urban park. This is Nature at it's best. Preserved forests, brooks, tracks (you actually can visualize Indian chiefs floating by...) yet, from the top you can have a great view of L.A. and it's high-risers. The Park has challenges for sportpeople, romantic spots for lovers, playgrounds for children - you name it.To top all that - there is The Observatory. This merits another, special review.

So we took about an hour and a half hike up, (not difficult at all), to the overlook that provided panoramic views of LA...so beautiful. I would highly recommend taking the time after going to the Observatory to head behind it and take the 1.5 mile hike up to the top of the mountains behind it.

Intertwined with a golf course and surrounded by equestrian trails, if you have clubs go for a brisk 9 holes or if you have horses, bring them. We did one warm Saturday and had a great time riding the trails. The tall trees surround the bridle trails and it is a very pleasant place to ride, even on the warm days of summer.There are dedicated kid areas that showcase ponies and even a miniature locomotive. My kids loved it when they were smaller and now my grandkids love it.

If you hike in the park, especially in the summer, be sure to wear good shoes, bring plenty of water, wear sunscreen, and watch out for snakes. There are definitely coyotes in Griffith Park (as well as a bunch of other wildlife), but they usually show themselves more when it gets dark. The views from the park are beautiful is you go higher up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kef1545
40,Nice place for a run or walk,"I live near the park and its a much bigger park then one would think seeing it from just one side. It is a dessert Park, so not much flowers or greenery, but the Observatory is in the park and a great visit, and you have some great view to the Hollywood sign and the city from those hills.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tamarao462
50,Fun Park,"Great fun with diverse activities for all the family to enjoy including the dog...One can find pony rides, train rides, zoo, museum and great hiking trails. It is also a great spot to picnic as BBQ are available for use.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaphaelG837
50,great views,there is a wonderfull trail up the mountain you can take. I recommend driving up on the buss and walking down just down go down the trail after dark its rough terrain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justins866
40,"Lots of choices, but beware the City's trail maps don't work!","We have done hiking, rode the trains, picnicked, enjoyed the Merry-go-round, and much more. My dad loved to golf there when he was alive, even though it was an average course. Concerts at the Greek Theatre, visits to the Observatory - all part of a signature experience for L.A. - this is, after all, the largest urban park in the world!However, if you're going hiking, do online research first, and prepare to get lost a bit, because the trail maps from the City are very old, don't usually reflect current conditions, and the trail markings get changed by people frequently (pranking, maybe?) plus, the rains re-work the trails when we finally get them... It's fun, great views, worth going an extra distance to complete a loop if the markings are wrong or the trail has changed. Just don't count on the timing being right.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mahsha57
40,"Griffith Park Observatory, magic by night","This is an awsome place, a ""must go"" for me when I am in LA. I like the park, and love hiking those trails above the Observatory, but what intrigues me most is the atmosphere and view that is there by night, with all the city lights. It is easy, you can drive there and enjoy the silence and the amazing view. It is magic and (if you are a couple) very romantic :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrem336
50,"great place for hiking, picnicing. griffith park zoo","We went to the old abandon l.a. zoo. WE saw the old zoo cages and there is a wonderful picnic area.

50,Griffith Park Observatory Hollywood Hiking,"When visiting Hollywood, one of our favorite things to do is hike above the Griffith Park Observatory. There are many simple trails starting from the parking lot adjacent to the observatory. To get there, go north on Vermont, pass the Greek, go through the tunnel and there is plenty of parking at top or along the road if you can parallel park. It's a 2-3 mile round trip with a 700' elevation change, medium difficulty even Inder people do regularly. Beautiful view from the top, but not the best starting point to go to the Hollywood sign (another 6 miles.)On a clear day you can see Paris Verdes, Catalina Island and San Gergonio (tallest peak in So Cal at 11,000 + ft) and snow capped on our visit.We also saw a horse tour coming from the Hollywood sign along the way.Bring a bottle of water, Good shoes and a camera for the memories.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan
50,Stunning views,"Even on a holiday (Christmas day!) this place can be packed with visitors, families and locals. Hikers, couples on dates, multigenerational families, all drive up the winding road to the observatory looking for a place to park. On the observatory grounds there are numerous vantage points looking toward snowy mountains in the distance, the city spread in every direction below, the nearby hills, and of course - the sight everyone came for: the HOLLYWOOD sign. Bring your camera.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AKT0707
30,"On a clear day, fabulous views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA","What a crazy zoo to get to the top! Traffic was bumper to bumper, and there is very limited parking at the top. We FINALLY found a parking place, and were greeting with fabulous views of LA and the Hollywood hills. We were there around 10 AM and discovered that the place didn't open until 12. That seemed strange. My boyfriend's favorite thing is the door that says ""Entrance"" and right below that says ""Not an Entrance.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sunmich2
40,Picnic in Griffith Park,"Had a lovely picnic there this Dec'16, a lovely warm and sunny day - with the most awesome views of LA ever !So take your food 'n drink and enjoy the fresh air - an unexpected treat in LA - though the drive up and finding parking was a bit slow .....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrgaryw
40,Beautiful view of the city,"We were so lucky with the weather on Christmas Day while visiting Griffith park. You can park downhill and walk, but we choose to park uphill and enjoy the view. Simply amazing. From here you have a nice view of the Hollywood sign and with clear weather you can see the ocean. Must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robert-Jan1972
50,The best of LA,"I love Griffith Park.It is my favorite hiking spot, my place to go in LA. Every free moment I have I love spending here. There is always ton of people on trails from the Griffith Observatory to Mt. Hollywood view point (strait opposing Observatory), and on the way to Mt. Lee, where the Hollywood sign is located, so you can always feel safe on those 2 trails, even if you are alone in early or late times of the day, just stay on the fire roads, and do not wander on less used trails.It is a large park with more then 4000 acres of land. In 19th century the owner of about 70 percent of what makes GP now, was Colonel Griffith J. Griffith and originally it was an ostrich farm. He donated it to City of LA in 1896. The remaining land was acquired through a purchase in 2010. It was in an effort to expand the park and prevent any eventual residential development in that area. I was told that GP had approx 53 miles of hikes....is it true or not, I don't know, but for sure it is an amazing hiking spot. You are in the wilderness, in the heart of the city.It is also home to many attraction, like:Autry National Center/Museum of Western HerritageBronson CanyonGreek Theatre (Los Angeles)Griffith ObservatoryGriffith Park & Southern RailroadMerry-Go-RoundHollywood Sign on the southern side of Mount LeeLive Steamers Railroad MuseumLos Angeles ZooTravel Town Museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeaM1408
40,Its Cliche but must be done.,"Theres no surprises here, you go up to Griffith to see the view, and thats excatly what you get. Its not as pretty as Hong Kong or Sydney harbour but for shear size its tough to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477warrena
40,Great Place For Hiking,"There are basically 2 parking lots and they tend to fill up fast so it's better to come here early in the morning. You can easily hike to the observatory, spend an hour to go to the Hollywood summit or 2 hours to the Hollywood sign. You can also try the horseback riding, picnic, among other activities.Downside? Parking lot is usually full and there really isn't much to eat around here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gesogeso
50,a magical place in the midst of the city,"A wonderful, magical place: with a merry go round, golf courses, miniature trainrides and traditional Park activities, like picnics, hiking etc. They also offer a special light display at night: it's crowded and expensive if you drive thru but you could walk.I find the park to be SAFE at all times of the day or night, but there are wild lifelurking about though I have never seen any. But hey, I have coyotes at my door in mid city. it's the CENTRAL PARK of the West and more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027

Its a very large park in Los Angeles.There are major attractions there such as the Autry National Center which we enjoyed going to. We have been a number of times.There is the amazing Griffith Observatory which we have gone to numerous times. Best time we like to go is at night.The Los Angeles Zoo is also in the park, close to the Autry Center.There is the equestrian center. This time we were able to see from a far a wedding that was being held on horse back. It was beautiful to watch. For children, there are pony rides.In the summer, we have gone to music events at the Greek TheaterIts fun to wander through and see the trains in travel town area,There is lots of places for playing in the park, having picnics, and enjoying being outside. There is a golf course as well.There is more.

40,Nice But for the Visitor Center,"This large urban park is well worth several visits. Go to the Visitor Center first to get a map, just ignore the rude clerk who could care less you are there! Hopefully, she is a volunteer and not being paid! We hiked the Bird Trail and saw some interesting specimens, even a coyote. The Autry Western Heritage Museum was the highlight. We spent half a day seeing the exhibits of art, western movie making, and two photography exhibits that were outstanding. A large exhibit of Adams, Westons, Cunningham and others had some of the most well known images. This was paired with contemporary images by Richard Mirasch. The collection of Native American and Cowboy artifacts is very large and will particularly appeal to those over 50. For young folks, there is a ""green screen"" that you can used, while sitting on a saddle, to be ""in the movies."" The cafe was well priced, comfortable, and the tortilla soup delicious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bilsue

The scenic walk around the planetiterium gives you great views of the Holywood sign, Holywood and downtown Los Angeles. The hiking trails are great but you need to be in decent shape .

50,Lots of things to do for all ages.,I have been coming to the park since I was a kid almost 40 years ago and have brought my daughter since she was a baby. There are many things to do for different ages. When she was under 3 we would go to:- children's play area and Carousel- the horse rides and the train rideOnce she got a bit older- travel town- hiking up the see Downtown skyline view- LA Zoo- more Carousel- bigger pony rides- Griffith observatoryThe hikes are good for all levels and fitness from wide dirt fire roads to shinny little deer tracks that seem to go straight up.All in all a great place to go relax for a picnic or get your dose of nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Robone13
50,A great place for Company and family gathering,"Beautiful park that also encompasses the LA Zoo with many picnic areas that can be reserved for friends and family or large groups such as company annual parties.Even in the heat of the LA summer, Griffith park can provide a nice escape from the heat with a relatively cool air provided by the canopy of many trees around the park.When planning an event, be sure to reserve well in advance as there are many groups and organization who take advantage of this beautiful park nestled in the heart of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElieB670

40,Enjoyable Hike,I always make a point of hiking Griffith Park when I'm in the area - the trail I usually take is not too steep though its 7 miles up and 7 miles down.

It was a hot day but there are loads of free water fountains throughout the park. Lots of people walking, with dogs or running. Once you get to the top the views of LA are pretty awesome and give you a real perspective of the size of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/403antm
50,Amazing sunset walk,"This place is obviously a popular walking route for many Angelenos, You will find that on a nice day the traffic up to GRiffith Observatory is very slow, since it so crowded and finding a parking spot is difficult. Thankfully there is also a DASH bus going to Griffith Observatory and back, which is useful especially in the evening. When I was there cars were not allowed up to Griffith Observatory for some reason, so it was impossible to get an uber. The bus is just 50ct and brings you to a metro station close by.The park itself is quite big, and gives many unique views of Los Angeles, especially Down Town and the sea are very recognizable. I mostly took the small walking paths off the main path, those followed the ridges of the hills there, they were a little more difficult and almost no people follow those paths. The main path up to the hollywood sign is popular with many people, and very easy to walk since it only slowly ascends, so it is not steep at all.All in all, enjoyed a nice slow 2 hour walk from the Observatory to the Hollywood Sign and back, and you don't need your own car to reach it! It is absolutely worth it, so if you're in LA and have time to do this, go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192marav
50,Fantastic place to spend an afternoon,"There is something for everyone here. It's a great place to walk, run, hike, ride horses (adults), ride ponies (kids), kids entertainment, picnic, bbq, etc. Locals make up a good majority of the people here for a good reason. It's a nice green space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StationToStation

50,"Hiking, carousels, trains, ponies, and views of LA","So if you're visiting Los Angeles, plan a trip to Griffith park. This park offers so much to see and do but if you have a few hours in the morning or late afternoon, park your car at the trail heads across from the Greek Theatre and walk up the hills to Griffith Observatory for stunning views of Los Angeles, Hollywood, and of course the Hollywood Sign. While you're up at there, check out the observatory, learn a little about the facility, our solar system, and the stars. Admission is free. It's usually very crowded so go early to avoid the heat or go later for watching the sunset and the sprawl of lights below that make up the city at night. Save yourself the hassle of parking and take one of the new buses that takes you the observatory. If you're not a hiker, do yourself a favor and take water, dress in layers, and travel lightly so you can make the hike up and down. Stay on the trails because the short ways down could land you in a cactus or face to face with a local reptile. You won't get to the sign directly so just enjoy the iconic views and take your selfies from some of the best spots for pictures of greater Los Angeles. And as you look directly south from the observatory, be sure to wave so I know you're there! Enjoy this great park and resource for both tourists and locals alike. And welcome to LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joe_Cool68510

50,An unlimited ceiling beneath which to dream,"After driving up through the park to the Griffith observatory, there before you appears the mighty Los Angeles, sprawled out like an ocean of dreams - whether those are shattered, deconstructed or realised. The effect of it takes the breath away momentarily.There are then a choice of miles of trails to take. Water bottles can be refilled in the car park at the observatory. The higher up you go, the better, and it is the scale of the view that really then grabs the attention. The amount of visible sky here seems massive, and staring out over Los Angeles forced me reflect on the 'nature' of this great city - of its history and culture - of the optimism that is so often attached to it in people's 'hopes' in coming here.Looking at the size of the sky - it did make me feel as though Los Angeles does have an unlimited ceiling beneath which to dream, and I could feel the allure. We just need to change the dream - to one that doesn't just work for a tiny minority.After which point, I settled my mind down and cracked on with a good prance around these parts and enjoyed the hike that we had chosen. There really is a lot of wonderful scenery in Griffith Park. It is possibly my favourite place in L.A. and well worth a good explore at any time of day. Hope you get good clear weather and enjoy your walk.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrison-F-Carter

However, having not visited for many years, I had a fresh look at it recently and realized just how much Griffith Park has to offer -- a zoo, travel town, the observatory, bird sanctuary, hiking and equestrian trails, parks for picnics and great views among other attractions.

Pony rides for kids only $3 but better bring more $$ because kids will want to go a few times. My 5 and 7 year old loved it. We also saw one year old babies ride.... Really!! Very safe! Great staff also. Little train rides are right beside ponies. A ten minute ride for $2.75 gets a thumbs up in my book.Visit Circle K for horseback riding! They were awesome.

40,VERY NICE! CROWDED.,"This is a nice park, but we could not find parking and later found that they were having a concert in the park that was beginning soon after we arrived. We were trying to give up to the Griffeth Observatory, but the traffic made it impossible and I believe we went as far as we could in the car before the police blocked off the road. We could have walked on foot, but we had other plans so we decided to forego it. But in any other circumstances we would have gotten out and walked in the park. It was a beautiful evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayWalk7
40,Great view - Day and Night,This is a great vantage point to view the hollywood sign and also to see LA. You can get some good photos from here day and night. It is a short drive from Hollywood and a short walk from the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattMonty88
50,Worth the wait,"Very busy when we arrived and couldn't get parked near the observatory so went for a picnic in the park, watched a film being made and also sat watching the many species of birds (lots of woodpeckers), squirrels etc. We drove back through the park and returned to the observatory. Managed to get parked on the road side and was very pleased that we had returned. Fantastic views over Los Angeles and the ""Hollywood"" sign can be clearly seen.As we had enjoyed the tranquil setting of the park, after visiting the observatory we returned just for some peace and quiet and to sit and listen and watch the birds again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maureencH8271HH
50,Quintessential view of LA,"If you want to see the quintessential view of LA, go here at sunset [and be prepared to struggle to find a parking space] to watch the lights come on over LA. But be sure not to miss out on the Griffith Observatory - FREE, small enough not to be overwhelming, and entertaining for both kids and adults",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ErnAlexander
40,Hiking with views,"Like many popular attractions in LA, parking can be a challenge here. That aside, though, this park features many trails and beautiful views of the city. We went during the day and enjoyed walking to Griffith Observatory. The skies were clear, but the there was a pleasantly cool breeze, so we didn't get too hot. Assuming you can get a spot fairly high up, you can see plenty even if you only have an hour here. But if you have more time, there appear to be many more trails to hike along.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zinear
50,Summer Summit Walk,"Couldn't rate this walk any more highly The view from the summit of Griffith Park is spectacular. As seen in the photos posted on here, you get to see a huge portion of LA city. The walk is about 1 mile and only requires average fitness. It isn't too steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G8656MPsamuelm
50,Nice break to a busy trip,"I was in LA on business and promised my son a picture of the Hollywood sign. This turned out to be one of the highlights of my trip. I wasn't dressed appropriately to leave the main trail, but had a pleasant walk of about an hour and enjoyed the views. I didn't get as close to the sign as I had wanted, but my son thought it was cool so mission accomplished!I wish I had come better prepared and had 2 or 3 hours to just hang out and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Harrydawgsdad
50,nice park,"It was a very nice park where you can go walking, hiking or running. Lot of trees, nice grass and a nice trail. If your trying to go to the griffith observatory you will past by the park first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kevind473
40,"Fresh air, great views",Went for a stroll on a chilly winter morning and it was perfect - you get to see the Hollywood sign from the distance and enjoy nature in general!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rrrebekah
50,The best free sight-seeing in LA,"Day or night the views are gorgeous. If you come during the busy times trying to find parking, you might be too frustrated to stay which I did one time. I would say this is definitely a must-see though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ango4
50,Great budget-friendly family fun!,"My kids loved this place—and so did my wallet. We visited on a Saturday and the crowds were very reasonable. We were able to ride the train and horses with almost no delay. We also rode the simulator. It was okay—nothing spectacular. There was a snack bar. The churros were good, but that's all we ate there. Parking lot was full, so we had to walk a little further than most guests. Great place to take families with small kids on a budget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DW-Surprise
50,Great Park,"If you are looking for a place to relax while visiting LA, this is a great place to chill out. Take a blanket and a picnic basket -- perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mshapiro99
40,Great views over LA/Hollywood,"I wanted to go up to the Observatory to see the Hollywood sign but heard about long queues to park at the top.Luckily I read about an alternative route involving a short hike so we entered the park from the southern entrance at Fern Dell Drive/Los Feliz Blvd and drove along until we got to the Trail Cafe shack. Free parking available along the road. Public toilets available next to the kids playground which is also the start of a couple of trails leading up to the Observatory.There are 2 main tracks from here, one to the left, one to the right. We went up the right one and came down the left but actually both offer very similar terrain and views. Don't bother taking photos of the Hollywood sign as you go up - the best angle/views are from the top. Most people will have no problem walking up, just take it slowly if needed, especially as there is very little shade so can get quite hot. We started walking up at around noon and got to the top in just over half an hour. Bring water if hot day. Going down needed more care as some steeper parts a bit slippery on the sandy path.Far reaching panaramas from the top with good view of the famous white Hollywood sign in the distance. The Observatory building also has some interesting multimedia exhibits on the ground floor which are free, the upper floors which I didn't visit require a modest admission fee.Overall, definitely worth a visit for some great views of the city and an opportunity to take a photo with an iconic sign being you - a must-do in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SerenaW237
50,Perfect in every way,"Whether you are hiking, strolling, or out for a picnic this is the place! Wonderful hiking trails with breathtaking scenery, parks and playgrounds for the kids, and the observatory if you like. Do it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miller2theresa
30,Great views but prepare to be dusty/dirty!,Great views of LA and the pictures are amazing! Hollywood sign can be seen in the distance but the hike up to the sign is about 7 miles each way. Bring lots of water and a snack. It gets super hot (it is sunny California) and it is super dusty as the hiking road is not paved so be prepared to get dirty. Free parking is available and the roads are paved up to the Observatory. You can decide how long you would like the hike to last depending on how far out you go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ceck00
50,Great place outside the city,"Griffith park has some incredible views of Los Angeles with some great hiking trails. It's also a good place to get a look at the Hollywood Sign. We didn't have time to visit the observatory, but it looked cool. We were there on a Tuesday afternoon and the parking lot was already full, so prepare accoringly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/114sama
50,griffith park is awesome,"if you think LA is one giant freeway, think again. great hiking, beautiful views. Take your dog, take some water, start at Fern Dell if you're a first timer. Start near Merry Go Round if you're a little more adventurous.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/w2conrad
50,Griffith Park - wonderful place to spend the day,"there are many things to do in Griffith Park. The Observatory is a wonderful place to see the city on a clear day. From Santa Monica to the Palos Verdes Hills to downtown Los Angeles, the view is wonderful. And spend time going through the exhibits and museum. There is always a good planetarium show which is worth while. Then go to the other side of the hills to the railroad museum, the miniature train ride or the pony rides for kids. Don't forget the merry-g-round. The Zoo if part of the park and although not up to the caliber of the San Diego Zoo, the kids will have a great time. Caution: The observatory is very busy on Saturday and Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsadon
40,Griffith park is ideal place to a glimpse of this fashion capital,"Once you are i La, Not to miss place apart from the downtown & hollywood is Griffith Park. You can relish the scenery of whole LA from this high suited park & plus you can sharpen up your knowledge at the Griffith Observatory located just adjacent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lion_chd
40,Griffith Park,"Had time before leaving Los Angeles. Took time and we're not disappointed. Great place for the family. Great views of LA and surrounding areas, when there is no haze. Enjoyed all the attractions.Next time would like to try hiking around the park",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsT7875EP
50,great city views,This spot is popular among locals and tourists. Come at least one to 2 hours before sunset otherwise you will have to park far off and walk up to the observatory. Great views of the city and the Hollywood sigh at sunset. No Parking fees.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Christy212121
50,Awesome hike,If you are into hiking and nature Griffith Park is definitely the place to go! So much to see and do for the nature lover. Make sure to bring a camera to capture pretty views and ofcourse water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aracely130
40,Great Views,We headed into the park mid morning and were lucky to find a parking space a good 20minute walk from the Observatory. After a pleasant uphill stroll you are rewarded with the sight of the Griffith Observatory and great views over the various parts of Greater Los Angeles and Downtown. You also have the Hollywood sign in the background.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TartanTeddyBear
40,Short Visit,Drove into Griffith Park and up to the Observatory during the daytime. Views are spectacular but the smog is a problem. Worth the drive up and walk around though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterMVA
40,"Nice hiking, great views, and easy access to local attractions","I took my family for a day in the park and at the observatory. We enjoyed an evening hike from the observatory into Los Feliz for food. The hike took us through beautiful neighborhoods, and on very accessible trails. We didn't make it to the stables yet, or through the rest of the park, and we look forward to coming back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/corpdoc
50,Fun and beautiful,"This is an amazing park with much to do. The Mediterranean beauty is like no other. Take yourself to Griffith Park, you'll have a great time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/738melissav
50,Great views of LA,"If you are looking for a place to hike in LA, then look no further than Griffith Park. My wife and I hiked a 3/4-mile trail up to Griffith Observatory. Even though the trail was under a mile, it was still a great workout due to the incline. When we reached Griffith Observatory at the top of the trail, we experience some of the best views that LA has to offer. From the top of the trail, we had great views of the Hollywood sign, downtown LA, and many surrounding areas. Griffith Park is definitely a great place to visit in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jordan_Rachel
40,Great FREE Beautiful Park,"Hello, I am visiting LA and decided to swing by this park. It is very nice with lots to do for everyone. I went hiking and saw breath taking views of city in all directions",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuteDrummergirl
40,Best Way to see LA,This was probably the best thing we did in LA. We could see everything including a great shot of the Hollywood sign. It was super busy and touristy so prepare for that. Also they shut down the parking for some reason but there was still a lot of parking open!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ColetteK683
50,An absolute MUST SEE!,"As they were filming on the stairs leading to the observatory building, it was hard to embrace all the stunning views from the top of Griffiths Park. However, my family and I saw enough to know that Griffith Park is definitely worth a visit. In fact, it is the best free experience you can have in LA. Let's face it, most people are drawn to Beverley Hills, Santa Monica, Disney and Universal Studios. However, before you dig deep in your pocket, this is an absolute must on your itinerary!Allow for a 45 minute stroll up Griffith Park to reach the top. Allow for a 2.5 to 3 hour window to really enjoy this experience. It's a no brainer - it's a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/955craigm
50,Every Moment Took my Breath Away,"GORGEOUS. Put your hiking boots on - there are a ton of trails. Some parts were harder than others, make sure you have plenty of water if you are hiking for a long period.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renias2016
40,Very pretty views,"There are a bunch of different trails to check out. Some easier then others and some with better views. The observatory is right there, as well as the Hollywood sign. You can catch view from LA as well. It gets hot midday, so I suggest checking it out in the morning or even for a sunset hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/east0ne
50,One of the best things about Los Angeles,Look: we're talking about 3200 acres. Literally hundreds of miles of hiking trails. A planetarium. Three kiddie trains. A carousel. A redwood grove with an outdoor cafe. A dude ranch. A world-class zoo. Three golf courses. Two playgrounds. All in the middle of a major metropolitan area. You could lace up your hiking boots and spend three days here and not see and do everything.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/betteryeti
40,See Hollywood and nature at the same time,"We came here as unashamed tourists wanting a good view of the Hollywood sign. We got that but loads more with a lovely walk on a trail designed for the viewing but also great views of Los Angeles and more. Hot, hot, hot - so take plentiful water, especially if you intend a long trek around the park. We didn't do that, but had maybe an hour's stroll so the children could take in the local flora/fauna and enjoy the views. Only downside I think would be the state of the toilets in the car park which were frankly disgusting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Stenvoid
50,Great Hiking. Amazing views.,"I hike frequently and I find Griffith Park to be one of my favorites. So many trails. There are trails for all levels whether a beginner or seasoned hiker. The views of Los Angeles are breathtaking. There are many picnic areas, ample parking. The Los Angeles Zoo is also at Griffith Park and a train museum too. A must do!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindysR5658SU
50,Fabulous views,Something for everyone at Griffith Park. See the Hollywood sign close up. Amaze at the views of downtown LA and beyond. Take the kids on a pony trek or mini train ride or just simply enjoy the hiking. Then there's the zoo and the observatory and all with free parking. An amazing day out!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nickyN6259YJ
50,No visit to LA is complete without a visit to Griffith Park,...enough said!ps...one if my favorites is to climb up to the Hollywood sign from the top of Canyon drive. It's about a 90 minute walk each way. Completely awesome :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alysonp802
50,night time highly recommended!!,i'd highly recommend a night visit as you'll be viewing LA city/hollywood from the top! night cityscape!! and it's cooling.... definitely a nice place to chill after dinner.. take a leisurely stroll,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asylumescapee
50,"Cannot describe, must see place","One of the best trails I visited in LA. If you like hiking through trails, you should visit there one day. Visited 3 times in two years. Every time I go to LA, I must visit for at least couple of hours.A three hours up and down hill, you can hike from there to the Hollywood sign and back. I did it with my 7 years old daughter and she had fun. Not every hike there is safe for such young age, you have to pick the write place if you have kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashrafym
50,Have an amazing time with friends,My two friends were very glad to go. We walk into a unmark trail were we took a rest and were able to see a beautiful scenery.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariacO8939AG
50,Huge park - lot of things to do,"Hiking, watching, observatory, theatre, beautiful and quiet neighborhood (great houses too)...free shuttles from the Metro station (Sunset/Vermont) on weekends if you have a 7day or 30day metro pass.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409jesusa
40,Plan Carefully to Avoid Tremendous Crowds,"Having never been there before, we got stuck in a horrendous traffic jam trying to get up to the Observatory to watch the sunset. After an hour (!), we finally made it to the top only to be told by the police that it was full and we had to go down. We left and gave up for the evening, but returned the next day (early) to go hiking. There are good, moderate hiking trails, and some decent bird watching, but very few amenities. We hiked up to Dante's Peak while the area was experiencing a record heat wave (it was at or over 100 almost every day we were there...) and we had to go back down because there was no shade, no place to refill our water bottles, and no place to sit down. I'd like to go back when it is cooler and hopefully not so dry--most of the vegetation was scorched. Tremendous views though, and worth the trip. If going at night, GO EARLY.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BelleBHouston_Texas
50,Great hike,It's great short hike. It's quite easy and can be done by almost anyone who are in okay shape. I have even seen kids as young as 4 or 5 doing this hike. The hike I am talking about it to the Griffith observatory. The park is well painted and the hike provides great views.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maybelater15
50,Hiking Trails,The Griffith Observatory is a very busy place especially during weekends and in Somers. If you were interested in hiking we would recommend driving to the top Area of Griffith Park Observatory and as you come up the hill take the road towards the right-you will start on a decent ( Beautiful drive ) and then you will see a parking lot on your right side. Park there and proceed on the trail...it is a good hike (wide trail) and takes you to the Observatory!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/5starreview
50,Free of Cost - an adventure worth a million,"I wont post my pictures you can find those a lot around the web, but this experience you should not miss being a week in LA or less. The view is amazing in any period of the day",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evgeniia25
30,Not the best place to see the Hollywood sing,I recommend going up to the top for the scenic drive but there are much better places to see the Hollywood sing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMLL
40,Nice mix of trails of variable difficulty,"It's a nice place to take a hike in the Hollywood hills...all the way to the iconic Hollywood sign if you so desire. It does tend to get hot and crowded as the day wears on so I'd recommend getting there early. There are a few fountains along the way but probably wise to bring your own water as well, it gets pretty warm and dry if you take one of the longer hikes.The hikes themselves are variable, they do a nice job providing options for all sorts of different people at different levels of fitness. We hiked to the highest point but did not want to take the time to go all the way to the sign, did not see the purpose really.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Retinol13
50,Somewhere Between a City Park and a Baby Yosemite,"I am a Chicagoan but I love California and go there frequently. This and the Getty Museum are my L.A. favorites ...My recommendation is go to the Griffith Park Observatory cafeteria buy something to drink and go sit on the terrace outside. You'll thank me later...To say this is a ""nice"" view would be like saying that the Mona Lisa is a nice painting. Maybe it's because I am a vertically challenged Midwesterner but I can still recall the first time I beheld the view on these hills high above the city . With the iconic Hollywood sign above and the mansions of Loz Feliz and the Hollywood Hills beneath and the city of L.A trailing off in the distance I was momentarily speechless.With the hills and trails and the fact that Griffith Park has a mountain lion living in it.( He usually avoids people...he has a tracking device on him) it feels to me more like something between Yosemite and Central Park.Cover your camera when hiking these very dusty trails..some dust got into my compact camera and that was all she wrote...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HistoryBuffet
50,Beautiful views,"Beautiful view, I did the hike to the Hollywood sign, It was about 5 miles from the observatory but work the 10 miles. Beautiful views of downtown LA as well",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt4jezus

50,Sport - Hike - Landscape - Vip's,Bring water and sunprotection with you... go there very early..it's getting crowded and hot after noon. If you want to see something without hiking..there is a shuttle...if you want hike...leave your car in the entrance...the parking up on the hill is always full.The observatory is free...nice information to take home. and if you are lucky...you will meet some Vip,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hosi27ch
50,Beautiful,Nice place to stroll along the walking paths looking at greenery and vegetation. The streams have fish and even a few turtles!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JANB378
50,The best place to hike!,Griffith Park has some of the best trails and views to offer! I used to hike Runyon Canyon but the trails in Griffith park are much more vast and diverse. Such a great place for an adventure!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opheliabright
30,Very big park,"The park is huge, well maintained. Would like to have visited it earlier to see the Hollywood sign at the observatory overlook, although the view is spectacular",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hjde
50,Plenty of trees and plenty of room to park,Griffith Park is in a great location. There is plenty of parking and plenty of space to walk around. It is also the location of the off site Greek Theatre parking which is very affordable and well done. We went back in the evening to get some nice views of the lights. Exit the 5 freeway at Los Feliz and it is right there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAtoEverywhere
40,Best views in town,"What an amazing place. Unfortunately when we visited the Observatory itself was closed but the viewing was still spectacular. Wished I had the opportunity to go up in the evening but not sure if you can do this and we were tied into an schedule that didn't allow this luxury. However, with free wifi up there it was great to upload some views so our jealous friends could share in its awesomeness.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/113andym
50,Best hidden attaction in Los Angeles,"Hiking through the hills (mountains) of an old zoo location that has been condemned for 51 years is quite exciting. A hiker can find old walking paths, rails, cages, buildings, and more. We even spotted a wild deer during our hike. If hiking is not for you, the animal caves and cages can be accessed with a short walk and there are picnic tables for family get-togethers. This Old Zoo is difficult to find unless you know exactly where it is. If you start at the Griffith Park pony rides, go behind to where the old ""working"" Carousel is, you'll find the maintained area of the old zoo. This is a great place to have a picnic, take friends, go for a hike, and the photo-ops are fantastic. It is a definitely ""must-go"" place in Los Angeles. It is also free to visit. When my pictures are posted, you'll get an idea of how much fun we had. GPS 4801 Griffith Park Drive and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MWB2011
40,Quite the walk and worth every step,"Another hidden park in Los Angeles, acreage of hidden places to relax and sight see.

Walking and riding path was also well maintained.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OpieT_12

40,Lovely drive,Had a lovely drive through Griffith Park and the scenery is lovely. Easy to drive and lots of signs directing you around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UkManchestergirl
50,Love Griffith Park!,"Love griffith park area as it has so much to offer including free + paid shows, observatory, travel town museums, great view of LA and Hollywood sign. Love the LA zoo as it is not too big and easy to cover with young kids in reasonable time unlike San Diego Zoo. It gets crowded on weekends especially long weekend so be ready to be stuck in traffic on your way to observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sidd_LA
40,Beautiful way to see the city,"Griffith Park is lovely! There are a lot of different entrances and a lot of different trails. You can find views of different directions of Los Angeles and can hike for hours. It can be taxing or relatively easy, depending on what trail you take. Beyond the trails, there is a lot of different areas to picnic which is fun! And you can ride horses or go to the Observatory, etc. It's fun! There's so much to do there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateoS8832HT
50,Best place to hike in central LA,"This is a great place to go for a hike to get a sense of the geography of the city and to do some exercise. The views extend 360 degrees. The hills are real too, so you get a pleasant workout. In summer, very little shade, so sunscreen and water is key.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAOXON
50,Wonderful Place to Visit,Lots of walking / hiking and great views. Definitely worth a visit in addition to the observatory. Kids loved the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CPINSL

50,Great park with plenty to see and do,"Great views over LA, some fantastic trails (including to the 60's Batcave and to the Hollywood sign), the observatory and countless other things to do, it's a great place to spend a day and then watch the sun go down over the city. All for free, well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FullFonz
50,Excellent park!,"This is a place which you must visit while being in LA. There are several playgrounds for the children but the main thing to do, according to me, is to drive up to the Griffith Observatory. The observatory itself is nice to look at but we didn't go inside. There's a very nice hiking trail starting at the parking lot and you can have a refreshing morning walk in the beautiful surroundings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Joky80
50,Great urban park with lots of hiking trails,"As many times as I've visited/worked in LA, I'd never visited this park. Great hiking trails (especially the canyon from Fern Dell to the Observatory). There is also golf, outdoor theaters, the zoo, enough to keep busy for days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AggieJoe79
50,Wonderful!,"I've been to Griffith Park three times now and each time I enjoy it more and more. There are so many things to do at Griffith Park. The Samuel Oschin Planetarium is stunning; you can do so many hikes in Griffith Park; the views from Griffith Observatory are amazing. In addition, it's home to the Hollywood Sign! Must see when in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/710maximiliang
50,"Lovely short hike, not too challenging!",We went there after a huge meal so the short hike was exactly what we needed! It turned out also that they had closed the driving option and thus it was the trail or wait 3 hours before the road opened.The hike is only 0.7 miles long and there are loads of great picture opportunities along the way. Be sure to bring lots of water and good walking shoes.The hike may be challenging for older people as well as babies in strollers.Best done on a less sunny day as it can get pretty hot!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventure_freedom
50,Gardens,"By all means, get out and walk a bit! The trails are wonderful. The flowers and trees are beautiful back drops for pictures!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/246kandy
50,My favorite place on LA,"This is one of the best city parks everywhere and my favorite activity during our stay in LA. We had the chance to visit and check out the Observatory. However I wanted to going for the hiking and views of the city. However, even I could not have prepared for how great this place was.We first entered and drove past the Greek Theater. We proceeded to the Observatory but had to park a long way from but the hike was part f the adventure. The clear skies and lack of foliage made every turn more amazing view than the prior. Finally we made it to the Observatory which exceeded my expectations on view, beautiful and expansive. However the best feature that beckoned us was Mt Hollywood above the Observatory which is the highest point of the Santa Monica Mountains in the city.Despite the heat, we hiked to the top and were rewarded with even greater views including incredible ones of the Observatory. In addition this was the best spot to peer into the San Fernando Valley as well as get great views of the San Gabriel mountains. All in all a great hike and way to see the city. We were also able to enjoy the sounds below of a concert at the Greek Theater.I can not say enough great things about this park. It may be the best city park in the entire United States. We certainly enjoyed it and you will as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GroverR
50,Come early,Griffith park is one of the best places to bring out of town visitors. The hike near the observatory provides great views of the Hollywood sign but parking is insane after 9am and bring water bc it's hot and dry. We found the hiking paths to be a little confusing so take a good photo of the map before you start the hike. Great views of LA on a clear day!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BnRadventures2015

40,Nice evening location,"I came to Griffith Park for one of the Shakespeare evening performances. Although the traffic was bad, as can be expected, parking was fairly easy. We came about 15 minutes prior to the show, and had no issue finding a nice spot. It was nice to be outdoors and to take a look around at the views and old zoo locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheLadyJess
50,Great location to get a good panoramic view of the city!,"Don't go on Monday because the center is closed, but you can still walk around the grounds and take pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeengreene
30,Too Busy And Hard To Park But Good City Views,"We drove to Griffiths Park because I had read their were good city views and views of the Hollywood sign. There was a concert on at the Hollywood Bowl which caused a traffic jam driving up to the Observatory. We parked and walked up a very dry dusty path. It had great views of the city etc and average views of the sign. We didn't, get to the Observatory but it was just crazy busy and too much to deal with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AucklandWiz
40,Amazing Views overlooking the City,Absolutely Stunning View overlooking LA. Loved hiking up the mountains to see the Hollywood sign and just get to enjoy the gorgeous view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sarahdup0nt
50,Summer 2016,Attended an outdoor viewing of Dazed & Confused with food trucks. The movie was great. More food trucks would have helped reduce the long lines and waits for food & drink. Parking is an issue. Recommend Uber or other transportation option.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/41marilynv
50,Breathtaking,I love coming up here at night. It feels like I'm worlds away from LA. The views thriugh the telescope and of the city are breathtaking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Webisan
40,Lots of ways for a family to spend time here!,"Griffith Park is not as muich an urban haven as Central Park in Manhattan or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, but it has lots of diverse spots to enjoy your family or a date. While most folks enter near Riverside Drive, where the road goes past the pony rides, the little train depot, the carousel, and eventually the Autry Museum and the LA Zoo, you can have a quiet walk or small picnic on the Hollywood side of Los Feliz, going up Fern Dell, In between is the Greek Theatre and the Griffith Observatory. If you are a hiker, jogger, or runner, there's lots of scenic options for you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/86michealb
40,Nice views,Griffith Park is quite large with lots of different things to do. There are many beautiful old trees to picnic under and lots of hiking trails. It's a nice place to while away a Sunday afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllyT43
40,L.A. Skyline View,"If you have never been to L.A. or, have been but wondered where this view is, it's Griffith Park, and the Griffith Park Observatory. There is hiking, and biking, and it's an all around great place.I highly recommend this as a place to go in L.A..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/672manuelq
40,Nice Walking Trails,"We had to get our steps in, and since we were already in the area checking out the observatory, we stopped by to check this out. It was a nice park with decent trails in a good neighborhood. The views impressed looking down at the city. A lot of it you see in various tv's and movies, which is nice for nostalgia sake I suppose.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/runaway2travel
50,Beautiful Hike,"We went here on a Sunday around 11:30 and were able to easily find parking. Also, it was FREE!!We took a short hike to get some nice views of the Hollywood sign. This hike doesn't go to the sign itself like we were hoping. Apparently that is a 5 mile hike somewhere else in the area.We took a few minutes to look at the exhibits in the Observatory (also FREE!!)Great way to spend a few hours with the kids!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaPep
50,The Griffith Observatory is a Must Stop,"We've visited the Griffith Park Observatory many times in the past 20 years, while our children were growing up. In recent years, the observatory has been renovated to include a huge lower level including a large theatre and restaurant. Admission is free, parking is free, so there is no reason to not visit. The observatories are open for viewing planets and stars, and there is something for all ages. We like to go in the late afternoon or early evening, and then stay for the gorgeous sunset over the Hollywood hills. Be sure to bring your camera as there are lots of opportunities for pictures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha
50,Amazing,This park is really nice and very big. You really must spend a day walking there because nature is very beautiful. Speccially the trees are very beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Viviangom
50,Great hikes!,Wonderful hikes with beautiful views on a clear day. Good cardio. Lots of options for longer hikes and a place I would definitely return to.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranE4684EI
50,Great hiking,"When visiting family in LA, we said we wanted to hike to the Hollywood sign. Little did we know what we were getting into! We both thought it would be a little 10-15 minute walk to the sign, take pictures, and head back. NO! With a 3 year old in tow and 2.5 hrs later, we still had not made it all the way to the sign. We were in the home stretch but decided to turn around. Even though we didn't make it all the way, it was a highlight of our trip. Being from Florida, land of complete flatness, hiking the hills was a lot of fun! There was a lot to see on the way and plenty of places to stop and enjoy nature. We would definitely do this again...though maybe be childless next time. Or at least of an age she can do long walks like this without being carried. Oh and we saw many people wearing sandals....bad idea! Wear hiking shoes or at least some kind of sneakers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natalieb515

40,Worth the Hike!,"Visited with our adult children. We went on Saturday afternoon, which apparently is a peak time. (It was a last minute decision.) We lucked out on finding a parking space on the side of road, and hiked up the hill about a mile to the observatory. It was worth the hike! Beautiful views! If I would do it again I would go on a week day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTraveler052

40,Griffith Park,Quite crowed and very little parking but it is a good place to visit. The planetarium show was excellent. Seeing Los Angles at night was beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/393patriciak
40,Very nice park and lots of things you can do!,"I'm an L.A. native and have fond memories of Griffith park. To my surprise I didn't know how many trails it had and you can walk these trails depending on where you enter the park. It's great for hiking, picnics, among other activities. It's a great escape from the city in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ecargsand87
50,Great trails!,Off of the parking lot for the observatory starts multiple trails through the Santa Monica mountains. You can choose from shorter easier trails to the steeper 4 mile hike up to the top of Mt. Lee behind the Hollywood sign. All of the trails offer amazing views of the L.A area just make sure your bring water!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleytM993WU

50,If you don't like Griffith Park then drive to another corner and then you'll like it,"There are so many parts to GP that it is hard to write about or sum in one review. There is the Ferndale section which is wooded and has a stream. There is a darling little coffee stop there. It is always cooler in that section of the park beause of the verdant enviroment. There is of course The Observatory. Which is great for a high shot of LA. Yes, you feel like you are in a movie when you are walking around the planetarium. I like to go at Sunset. But it can get crowded especially on weekends. Then there is the Travel town section with the vintage trains. Great, for kids who love climbing around the locomotives and one hell of a gift shop. Say that twice. By the way there are two areas of the park that have little trains that can be ridden. There is one by Los Feliz Blvd. there are other rides, including ponies. And then there is the little train at Travel town which is on the north east corner of the park about ten minutes from the other one. I like Travel town better. There is of course the golfing at the park. I don't golf but I know people love it. And of course there is the Zoo & Gene Autry Museum. I have NEVER been disapointed by Gene Autry. It is one of the few museums in LA right now that has a curator who knows what the heck they are doing. Just writing this hurts my fingers..that's how big a park it is.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyHawaii
40,Great walks,The park is huge but rather brown and dry at the moment due to the drought. The observatory is very crowded but there is plenty of space in the park for a bit of solitude.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albywon
40,Close to nature,The park is quite big and covers a lot of ground.There are some walking and mini hiking trails you can try.Very soothing if just sit around. very good place to spend some quality time with family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abutaiyab
40,The View.,Griffith park is a great place to hike. Parking near the Observatory can be tricky and I recommend you get there early. The views near the Observatory are awesome. You can see the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSIfan3167
50,Great views and hiking,"We drove up to the Observatory and hiked some trails from this point. Do note, you can see the Hollywood sign just by going up to the Observatory. While it is a side view, you can still see it and get some pictures. If you hike the trails at this end, you will get a closer side view of the sign. There are bathrooms and water fountains up at the observatory. The trail was a nice hike and would definitely do it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostfringie
50,It is Beautiful. Plan on Spending the Day,There is so much to do at Griffith Park. It is huge. It is super hot in the summer so go in the morning or in the late afternoon.The zoo is there as well as great hiking paths and beautiful views. On some trails you can take your dog. Beware of ticks. Use a repellent.Travel Toy is also at Griffith Park as well as an old Carousel which is fun.It is very tourist friendly and the locals are knowledgeable of the area and can direct you.You will pay to park.Have fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
50,Something for everyone,"This review is based on numerous visits over the years in LA. The kids liked the Merry-Go-Round and pony rides. We have picnicked there many times, which can be combined with a visit to the Griffith Observatory, travel town (the kids liked the train rides and exploring old trains) or a hike. It was fun to identify the places where Hollywood movies and tv shows were filmed (Rebel Without a Cause, Batman, Back to the Furture and Terminator).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spiritwheels
50,Something for everyone,"Griffith park is the size of a small town! Within its boundaries you will find 53 miles of hiking trails, a lake, golf course, riding stables, camp grounds, picnic areas, Bronson Caves, and much more. The place to go to get away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davec110
50,Great Hike,The views are outstanding. Hikes can be gentle or challenging. DEFINITELY bring lots of water. The hike up behind the Hollywood sign is iconic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nundrum
30,On a clear day it would be great,"We drove to the top near the Observatory. but the LA smog prevented us seeing the city high-rise buildings, but we could see the Hollywood sign. The car park was full, and we had to park way down the hill. It seems this is a very popular spot, and I'm sure on a clear day or night it would be spectacular. Wait for the right sort of day before venturing out if it's the view you're after.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/248grega
30,Nice Place for a Hike,"While visiting Los Angeles, my wife and I decided to hike a path in Griffith Park. This park offers a lot of activities for all age groups. We just decided to hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CurtK815
50,Great hiking trails,"many trails to hike or just to relax and enjoy the city view. They have donkey ride for kids and horse back riding for adults. In the past, people reported seeing mountain lions and rattle snakes, but I am luck enough not to encounter any of them.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b0gardc
50,An Unexpected Highlight of Los Angeles,"Griffith Park is one of the mostly undiscovered gems of Los Angeles. Sure, lots of people know about the manicured lawn, kid-friendly parts, and there are plenty of those. But there are also vast areas that are almost completely wild - where the rustling you hear in the bushes is just as likely to be a wild animal as another hiker. The park itself is enormous and wonderfully varied - there are places for everything from family picnics to drum circles to wilderness hiking. For a tourist, it may seem strange to come all this way to look at trees and grass; after all, you probably have some lovely parks back home. But for the Angelinos lucky enough to discover it, Griffith Park is an uncommon and wonderful gift.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ProPhotoLA
50,A must do while visiting LA,"Every visit we always try to go to the top of Griffith Park for the views. Unfortunately the day we were there, on a Monday, the observatory is closed on that day of the week so all we had were the views. The observatory is excellent so plan on visiting if it's open. The view from the Hollywood sign is also great and you can do one of three hikes to the sign depending on your fitness level. Google it and you can learn more about the different hiking trails. The entire hill is brown because of the drought so it's not very attractive. We were there during the heat wave they had so bring your own water and snacks to the top. Parking is severely limited and we had to park on the road going up and walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BushkaTexas
40,Beautiful view,"You can see the Hollywood sign, hike and see the observatorium. There was a lot of cars, but not problem if you have time. We went for 1 hour. Free wifi.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anonym92

50,Very interesting.,The history behind this place is great. The plants on Fern Hill from all over. The science of all kinds inside. And the best part is this is all free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmssun50
50,Just wonderful..and lovely view,"The place is popular with tourists as well as locals, hence crowded. But it is well worth the drive uphill. You are rewarded two gems. The park, and the Observatory.There is a trail that goes right upto the Hollywood sign. Apart from that, you will find jogging / hiking tracks too. The view of the financial district as well as the rest of the city is stupendous.Do come here. It is an oasis amidst the urbanisation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BhawaniPathania
50,Fantastic view,A little crowed but the view is perfect. Hollywood sign and the city view - just great ! People are hiking up or you just leave the car in front of the observatory center. We were not in there - we just enjoyed the view.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niciam2015
40,Wow!!!,We stumbled across this park by accident! Glad we did! Nice views! Parking sucked but it was worth the pictures of the surroundings and Downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srmccracken
40,A run to the hills,"The Griffith park is one place that you can enjoy, aside from having physical activities like jogging (uphill so prepare your knees & water as well), picnic with the family, going to the Observatory (where a scene from the Transformers movie was shot) & the having a view of the city (was told it is better see it at either sunrise or at night). Cool breeze runs through in the morning & slowly sips into day, drinking fountains are located in park, also trails are available for those who wanted to try some off-road trekking/hike/jog, just make sure you're wearing the right pair of shoes. Once you're in LA, one need to check Griffith park & be amazed of what the place can show you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iancarl0

50,Excellent zoo,"We went to Griffith Park to go to zoo, collection of railroad cars and western museum. We only made it to zoo as it is huge with very different animals than are present in other zoos. The carousal was fantastic with so many different animals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N5263WGcarolr
50,Gem in the heart of the city,"Griffith park is located in the heart of the city, but you would not know it while meandering through the park. It is a very beautifully planned park that has trails that can take the visitor all the way to the Hollywood sign. It is a great space to hike in, as well as spend a quiet afternoon. A truly beautiful spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ezinneu
50,Worth the walk,"We walked from the bottom and up in about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning it was a good workout sesh + the most amazing view. People are friendly and happy. And you even see the Hollywood sign at two of the points",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Subasna
40,Spectacular views,My friends and I went late in the afternoon about 2hours before sunset. It was still boiling hot and had to walk up to the observatory but once you get to the top all the pain is forgotten. The view is amazing. The park is clean and tidy and the police are always present to keep any trouble makers away.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wynmardel
30,Great Views,"Great place to hike, see a view of the Hollywood sign and LA. There's a cafe there and also a few scientific things to do inside. A bus also runs up there which will help you avoid parking far. Would I visit again? Maybe. Not at the top of my list though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VOYAG3R1
40,Great place to learn!,"There is so much to learn here, I wish I lived nearby to visit it more often. Great place to learn about the solar system, the stars, the sun, the seasons and so much more! There is much more to see and I wasn't able to check it all out. But if you go at night you get to see the city lights. And if you go check out the telescope so that you can see the stars. When we went they had to close the telescope because of an ash cloud.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soychiquis

50,Great walk and views,"Griffith Park in the centre of LA contains both the Griffith Observatory and Hollywood sign, and are about 3 miles apart from each other. The walk between them is gorgeous, going over rolling hills and taking in the views of Los Angeles city from above. Make sure to bring plenty of water with you as it can be quite hot with little shade up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MattSRob
40,Lovely but hard work!,"We walked here from our hotel on west sunset & endured the walk uphill, my girlfriend really struggled but it was worth it, amazing views but no signposts or cafes to break up the climb, not for the feint hearted !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gurnico
50,GREAT PLACE TO HAVE A FAMILY OUTING,"There is tons of parking available and an equal number of picnic tables. If you stay down below the Observatory you can enjoy the peace and calm of nature. Wander up the trails, get some exercise and some amazing views. A nice change up to the craziness of LA and the freeways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SenorGancho
50,Get Above It All,"Well it's fun all over this park! I love that even with all the people living in this city that we have this area for free to enjoy!

50,Go for a hike or just enjoy the view,"You can drive up and start from the top of the hill where the Griffith observatory is and enjoy the beautiful panorama of LA, or the other way around taking a walk/hike up and explore some of the trails in the park. Hiking shoes or at least some shoes you don't mind getting dirty recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/articok
50,Merry Go Round,"Frist of all... Griffith Park is a huge area. There is a lot to do and explore. The Park as itselfs, the Observatory, etc. But the most beautiful thing is the ""Merry Go Round"" close to Griffith Park Visitor Center. 66 wooden horses with history, because the carousel is from 1926. Beautiful details everywhere. This is a very special carousel with a lot of stories to tell. Try to find Esmeralda, Diavolo, Skygazer, the Unicorn, or the funny horses and enjoy the amazing place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JesseBlue
50,A large area with great views!,There are great views of the city and Hollywood sign. The park is huge! We also went to the observatory and there are viewing areas and neat displays inside too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hj99

50,The Everything Park,"Griffith Park is not only home to the Hollywood Sign, Griffith Observatory, the Loa Angeles Zoo and the Autrey Museum but has miles and miles of great hiking trails and scenic overlooks, plus bike paths and picnic areas, free summertime Shakespeare in the Park, pony rides, train rides and a train museum. You can ride horses through Griffith Park or take a ride on the giant antique merry-go-round or play a round of golf. We are at Griffith Park at least 3-4 times a month. There are always new areas to explore. We are so lucky to have such a treasure right in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jocelyn1157
50,So Much to do and See,"THere is so much to do and see in Griffith Park. Like Central Park in NYC, it is many different things to many different people, but unlike Central Park, most people drive to get there.

40,Views of LA,Great family spot to take the kids to see the observatory and the views of LA.

Amazing views of Los Angeles from there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vee1050
50,Cannot recommend it highly enough,"So much space, such beautiful views. I advise people to get an online map before and PLAN THEIR HIKE beforehand. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes, shorts, and have sunblock and shades. Once you get there, you'll fall in love with the lovely scenery and the peaceful environment of people hiking with their friends and family. It's just spot on, and you'll want to walk around for hours and hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cx1111
40,Go for the views and visit the observatory,"We took an uber as there are often traffic problems on the narrow road to the observatory. Once in the park you get to see the Hollywood sign and amazing city views at Sunset, while you are there go see the observatory its free and amazing (light shows cost 7.00).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppynic
40,Spectacular views,We couldn't get up as far as the observatory due to the mental traffic snaking up there and barriers across letting any further cars anywhere near but did manage to park up further down and still managed to get some amazing City views at Sunset,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dancing_Zorbas
50,Great Views of LA,"First of all: If you're going to the Griffith Observatory area, keep in mind that you can't park there. You need to leave the car somewhere in the middle of the ascent and then walk on one of the trails (or on the road but that takes even longer). For us two young people this wasn't a problem, but I can see how it could be a dealbreaker for some.Other than that: It's a very nice park. It provides stunning views of LA—its downtown and urban sprawl. The Hollywood sign is also visible but it's not the best place to take pictures of it. There are two or three nice viewpoints along the main trail.Small note: it's probably better to rely on your instincts or use a print map to get from the bottom to the observatory; we tried to use Google Maps but it wasn't 100% accurate and we ended up really confused until we just stopped using the software.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ynhockey
50,Elevated view of LA - Park with many trails,"Be aware that all the trails are pretty exposed to the sun, so have some water with you. We walked from Observatory to Hollywood sign, and back. To the sign via few summits, back then another path. Overall it is not very demanding or high elevation gain. Early mornings seems to be the better time, since parking lots at observatory was pretty empty, and trails are not very crowded, and its not very hot yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KKBuddy
50,Nice hiking.,"This park is huge, with lots of hiking options and plenty of weekly activities and events. The air is fresh and there is lots of greenery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petuniasprout
40,Oasis in the city in a lovely part of town,"We walked right from the nearest Metro station through some lovely & charming suburban areas to the entrance of the park and then up the trail, past the views of the Hollywood sign, to the Observatory. Such a lovely part of LA and once you hit park a sense of peace overtakes you. The air is clearer and things seem brighter. Trails offer great views all the way up and the panorama from the top at the observatory is expansive. Walk from the metro approximately an hour or so each way and recommended to see a different side of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingChonyT
50,Sunny day views rainy day activity,Went on a sunny day. Lots to see views amazing inside of museum really cool. Parking is an issue but you can park and ride. Nice cafe and good value souvenirs.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/juliamanning2015
40,Griffith Park Observatory at night,Find out when the telescope will be open and check the schedule for the planetarium. Bring your good camera and a tripod. The sights of LA from above are incredible. You can see the Hollywood sign from the Observatory deck.The museum is well worth the visit. Very fun educational activity.It would be nice though if they kept the cafeteria open later as it is a night time activity. So I would suggest taking a bottle of water with you to keep hydrated. Be prepared to park down the hill a fair walk from the observatory. There is limited parking at the summit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TWS871
30,Be prepared for LONG backups,"Lovely view from the top of the mountain. Sunset is pretty if the clouds cooperate. But be prepared for a gazillion cars going up the hill with you. The planetarium offers a lot and it is a really nice view. Just assume you are on the 101, enjoy the view on the slow ride up and even slower ride down if you stick around for sunset. Perfect view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poipoi29494

50,Underated Beauty in the Middle of the City,"Griffth Park goes often unnoticed by even a lot of Los Angeles Residents, but it is truly a wonderful place with a massive variety of activities to enjoy for the entire family.

It also contains a lot of parking spots spread through the park so be sure to drive around and make several stops along the way to check out all it has to offer. The park is a photographer's dream locale for obvious reasons. One of the park's hidden gems for those who like to hike and explore is the old LA Zoo, the now-abandoned old home of the LA Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divisiblebyzero
40,For Tree Lovers From the Desert,"Griffith Park has a lot to offer. To name a few; a bird sanctuary, the Griffith Observatory, and the Greek Theater. To be honest, as a person living out in the desert areas of Texas, I really liked the park for the basic things that parks are great for; lots of trees and lots of grass. There are a lot of trails to go up to the observatory if you prefer the hike over just driving up there. Overall, great park in a big city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ishm_13

40,A beautiful walk,My daughter and I walked through the park as part of a hike to the Observatory. There are lovely picnic areas among the trees and toilets placed in obvious areas.

The equestrian center is nice but could use better food options. The Zoo is great and there are plenty of trails. We explored the old zoo which was pretty cool. My son liked going in the old exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drkathyj

Toilets/washrooms at the car park. Fantastic views over LA and Hollywood, including the world famous sign.Really recommend a visit, get there ahead of the observatory's opening, to assure a spot in the car park, but none then the access road takes the overflow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gordonh267

40,Cool urban park,"My coworker showed me Griffith park, which I had previously only heard about. I had no idea it was so big and I love the little train and cultivated greenspace along with the untouched land for exploring. The Los Angeles landscape is not my favourite but this was a cool place to explore and I'm glad it's set aside in such a big city. It reminds me of Stanley Park in Vancouver.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeganWalters

50,the big jewel of LA,"Griffith Park is the big jewel of LA. I had the good fortune once of flying into LA at night on a small plane and asked what that big black area was. I never realized how HUGE Griffith Park is! And whether you want to amuse the kids at the Train Park or LA Zoo, Western buffs at the Gene Autry Museum, stargazers at the Griffith Observatory, or hikers with walks in Elysian Park or to the Observatory, Griffith Park has something for everyone. Hey, you might even see (or get attacked by) a mountain lion or rattlesnake -- right in the middle of LA!!! That'll never happen to you in NY, Chicago, SF or any other big city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Drucksterino
50,A beautiful respite in LA,"We spent the day at Griffith Park midweek. It is very large with many entrances. We were in and out of the park, going to different destinations. There is a merry go round with several parking lots where we hiked a bit through well maintained trails. The picnic areas, playgrounds and restrooms were well maintained. The grounds were clean and there were plenty of rangers to offer guidance and direction. With some help, we were able to find the ""Old"" LA Zoo, which was in operation from the 1930s-60s. The grounds are pasture-like with enormous trees. We finished our day at the impressive Griffith Observatory, also in the Park. Next time, perhaps we will see a show at the Greek Theatre, which we passed while leaving the Observatory. The park is a wonderful way to spend the day in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wuvhawaii
50,22:00 closing!,"This is one of the most important landmarks in LA. But be prepaired: at 10pm they close the accessing roads, so if you driving from Santa Monica for an hour to see it you will be upset..It is worth to visit after sunset. The City is beatuful from there. Visiting is free - all of your friends will be fascinated - for free.My navigation shown 2 ways to go up, but the only one we found starting above the Chinese Theatre.Worth to check the website for the opening times - the Observatory frquently closed for movie makings or private events.Must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Itdoesentmatter

50,A beauty of Los Angeles at your feet,"Griffiths Park is a beautiful, natural area near Hollywood. The top offers a panoramic view of the city, - all the way to the sea and of the mountains and the Hllywood sign. It's a great venue to watch the sun set over LA and the lights come on in the city below. The parka also offers lots of trails for people with all levels of ability, including provisions for disabled visitors at the observatory.Watching the sun set over behind the mountains is a very romantic experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3bsa

30,"Amazing views, but...","A historical landmark, for sure.The only real amazing thing to see is the Observatory. After you spend much of the morning in traffic getting there, it's finally worth it. The parking lot was probably built around 1935 as it simply cannot handle the busloads of tourists that arrive on the hour. Daytime is best but if you absolutely must visit at night, be careful. Crime is way up this year in Los Angeles and I would not recommend a leisurely walk thru the park at night. Due to State budget cuts, Park Rangers seldom patrol anymore and gang members and thugs have been seen after dark getting high and drinking beer. The best street to drive up for the Hollywood Sign is Beachwood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddyb1968

50,Breathtaking views of LA!,"Being and Angeleno and used to see and visit the numerous wonderful places we have around here, I sometimes leave them out when it comes to reviews on Tripadvisor since I have mostly used it while traveling to either other cities or abroad. That's why I decided to be a bit fairer with local places and give them the attention they deserve.Griffith Park is not just a historic landmark for Angelenos but one of the largest urban parks in the U.S. It is a good option whether you are hiking solo or with family, friends, etc. if you are visiting LA, this is a must, don't forget Angelenos are all about fitness, hiking, outdoors activities, etc. 😊It could be sort of difficult to find parking along the roads during the weekends when the park receives thousands of locals as well as visitors.Don't forget your bottle of water & sunscreen. Hiking could be as long as 2+ hours so try to eat something before heading to the park or carry a snack with you.Views are breathtaking in those clear days. You could see all the way to almost LAX, 110/105 junction, downtown, Century City, Hollywood, Glendale and other parts of San Fernando Valley.Most of the trails are good for beginners so don't be afraid.Have fun guys!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z1899IMfrankg

50,Gorgeous hike!,"We spent 4 days in LA for a friend's wedding. Of course the weekend we were there it rained every single day! BUT we live in FL so rain means something different to us! We decided to hike starting at the East Griffith Observatory Trail. My husband isn't in the greatest shape so I wanted to find a trail that would be beautiful but not to strenuous. We parked across from the Greek Theater and found the trailhead easily (thanks to modern hiker dot com's excellent descriptions!). It was a rainy (well really ""sprinkling"" to this FL girl!) overcast day but it was BEAUTIFUL! I love experiencing undisturbed nature, natural vegetation & the trail offered much. We hiked up to the Observatory, looked around at the beautiful views (beautiful even though visibility was limited). Then my husband said ""let's hike some of these other trails!"" I was shocked and happy because I could've hiked there all day! It was the best time we've had in a long time. I highly recommend hiking here. I will definitely do this every time I'm in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunShineGal231

50,Bustling park in the city,"A good partial escape from the smog of LA. You will still be surrounded and hear cars and people and buildings, but also by trees and a few wildlife.

Sever different entrances check them out before you arrive to see what best fits your plans. Fenced playgrounds and spots for frisbee or football. No gates or fees, limited parking but seemed like there was enough. Narrow road and limited turn around in some spots. I would not bring an RV, large vehicle or tow item into either entrance I visited. As with any park check website for wildlife warnings prior to your visit.

50,"Must see in Los Angeles, for views and nature lovers","Griffith Park is Los Angeles' Central Park. It is a large mountainous park in the middle of the city, much less accessible than Central Park or the usual city park. It's great for hiking as there are many trails from which to choose. When you get up high, the views are amazing. The trails are a good workout -- consider yourself forewarned. There are some good destinations within Griffith Park, including the Greek Theater for concerts in the summer and the Griffith Observatory. The Planetarium shows at the Observatory are a personal favorite. The park extends from the Los Feliz area -- hip, urban area -- to the Valley where you'll find the Zoo, The Autry Museum and other attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HuntressCA

50,Childhood Spent in Griffith Park,"As a child of 12-16, back when many of the homes in the area were still owned by old Hollywood movie stars, I would frequent the park trails and streams all the way up to the Observatory. Then walk out on the famous balcony overlooking Hollywood and LA. We later rode our motor scooters through the eucalyptus forests and down to the zoo and attended concerts at the Greek Theater. It's all still there, and this area has tons of old Hollywood history. Love Griffith Park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EddieLTravels
50,Fantastic urban park,"We live 10 minutes from here, and enjoy so many of its amenities. The playgrounds are top notch; there are readily accessible tennis courts; there are convenient bike lanes along the road through the park. There are great hiking trails that offer fabulous views of the city and the Valley. There are two 18-hole golf courses, which can be crowded, but at times are not too bad, and always fun to play. The zoo is also here, and a terrific destination. The carousel is also a gem, and is open on weekends and holidays, and is an experience you will not forget. In short - this is a great destination for locals and out of towners.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gdutton
20,Crowded,"What can you say? It's Los Angeles. It's crowded. There aren't that many parks in LA given the size of the metropolitan area. And, it's a nice enough park. But it's almost always very crowded, and that doesn't give one a very park-like experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/525BillS
40,More than the Observatory and hiking.,"Unbeknownst to us, the Park offers a train ride and pony rides not too far from the Train Museum. They are just down the road from the zoo and Gene Autry Museum. The pony rides ($4) are different size ponies for different ages. The rides are more than just a walk around a ring. They actually trot and the kids get a kick out of the jogging and they get two laps per ride. They are completely safe on their own during the ride. They are allowed to stay on and pay for another ride (don't have to stand in line again). Our first visit was on a weekday and there was no waiting. We went again on Sunday and had a very long wait (partly because so many take that second ride).The train ride ($2.75) is quite enjoyable and adjacent to the pony rides. You travel through natural surroundings but there might also be festive decorations along the route depending on the holiday",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lpetz
50,Amir's Garden is my favorite hike in Griffith,"I love the hike up to Amir's garden both by path and by stairs. The garden itself is such a tranquil hidden gem among the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. There are plenty of small paths and benches. Just keep an eye out for wildlife especially snakes.Park at Mineral Wells, about 1/2 way between train town and the driving range.There are many great hikes throughout the park, as well as a carousel, train town, zoo, observatory, etc...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Puppetgirldotnet

50,Ready to hike,"We did a lot of driving while visiting California, so our outing to Griffith Park was a wonderful chance to be away from the traffic and hustle and bustle. We bought along our lunch and found plenty of picnic tables next to the carousel. We spend our remaining time just hiking, looking out at the expansive scenery, taking in the park from many gorgeous vantage points. Pony rides and also offered, though we weren't interested in doing more than hiking on foot around the mountains that surround the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C3792LMericm
50,More than expected!,"I'm not a huge fan of LA, so every time someone asks me what to do, this is probably the only place I'd recommend. Not only is it free but also very entertaining, people are standing around outside with telescopes and show you what's to see out there. In addition, you get a super nice view over the city on one side, on the other you can see the Hollywood sign as well. Be aware that the place gets very crowded though, especially at sunset. But it was still worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/die_lilo

20,"Nice for kids, NOT adults","This is a cute attraction for kids, however NOT for adults, we(2 adults and a 16 year old) went on the first day of our vacation with the impression that this is a normal sized train that goes all around Griffith Park. It does not, it goes around in a small circle in one corner of the park. Also, the cars are very small, and adults are cramped and have to bend your knees. Also, this is not nessasairly their fault, and they can't do much about it, but coming from the East Coast, where there is absolutely no drought or watering restrictions, the amount if dead plants was upsetting and ugly. Also, just PSA, this is not Travel Town; travel town is in the NW corner of Griffith Park, and this is in the SE corner. Travel Town from what I hear has a nice museum connected. All in all this is a cute diversion for families with small kids (and the price is great for that), but not for a adult only group.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YaacovD
40,Take a picnic,"We took a picnic, had a canyon walk then returned for lunch with the locals. Well worth the time and effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnPagani
50,Wonderful haven in the city,"Our first visit to LA. Even on an overcast day, visiting this park was a joy. Wonderful vistas, any number of hiking trails, and of course the Observatory at the top. Yes, the traffic can be terrible. Plan for it. You may find that you have to park downhill and walk quite a bit if the observatory is in your plans. But don't let that dissuade you. The 360° views are well worth it. We only touched a small portion of this park; can't wait to come back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hammbrook

The park was crowded, but everyone seemed to be having an equally enjoyable time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bocadey
50,Great place to touch base with nature!,This is my place to explore and unwind all while hiking the tons of trails it has. I go solo with my pup or pups both day and night which is what i prefer. I have never had a bad or scary night hike and even with my flashlite in hand i seldom ever used it. I'm that comfortable even walking the dark trails! Guess thats just me but it where i find peace and quiet and the icing on the cake is always waiting there at the top with a view that takes my breath away.

40,It was quite impossible to park during December!,"We went there just before Christmas and it was quite impossible to reach. The road up to the observatory had a lot of traffic and people were parking their cars on the road and walking. That was not a possibility because I had a young child and old parents. We left the car when we finally achieved the top while my husband stayed in the car, having the impossible mission to park it. But I think he was lucky after a while.Besides this difficulty, the observatory was nice. We had the chance to see the sun set there! Also, the little ""museum"" inside was interesting for my son.Ly the way, the coffee shop is just ok for something hot to drink. But those telescopes that runs with coins are just money-taking... They have limited movement and are very heavy, especially for small children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElineLee
50,Fun stop,"Wow! This was amazing! Check it out! The building was open and there is more to do than meets the eye, because so much is actually underground. I went during the day time, and want to come back at night!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thewaterman69
50,Griffith Park is my backyard,"I live directly below Griffith Park observatory and for the last year have had the great pleasure of getting to know the area. Having lived in Los Angeles for nearly 30 years, I really hadn't spent much time in this area before moving here and had only been to the observatory once. Don't miss going to the observatory at night! The view of the city lights is spectacular. Be prepared to hike up the hill (yes, I said hike, it is not an easy walk) as there are (surprisingly) many people there at night and parking is at a premium. The daytime hike from the bottom (Ferndell entrance, by the bear statue) is gorgeous and the view of the observatory against the blue skies as you first come upon it is awe inspiring. At the base of Griffith Park where you start your hike there is a small cafe (aptly named ""the pie place"" by locals) for coffee and treats. Further down Los Feliz blvd you'll come upon Hillhurst Ave- with many cafes, the local favorite being Alcove, 1929 Hillhurst Ave. You'll view all the stunning, huge historic houses on Los Feliz Blvd, some dating back to the 1920's and the heyday of Hollywood. Much better than Beverly Hills! (But I'm a little biased, I love my neighborhood).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle-mirk
50,Excellent outdoor place,"I visites this excellent place with my family. We loved the grassy hills, the hiking paths, and the facilities in general. This is a perfect place for photographers and in each corner there is a view worths a photo",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/talali2016
50,Beautiful Oasis In LA,"I love all of the fantastic hiking trails and grassy hills, the live oaks and amazing views of the mountains and the ocean. The LA skyline is quite the sparkling backdrop at dusk. Lots of coyote and deer in this giant green space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerNate
10,Griffith Park,"It's a little misleading to refer to this outstanding location as a ""park"" because it certainly doesn't meet that expectation. However, this was one of the nicest things I've ever done in Los Angles. The ""park"" is the ideal place if you want to get some serious exercise. You can hike up the trail at your own pace and make this a wonderful experience. You will find people doing the same thing - from experienced to novice hikers. Leave time to check out the observatory - another must see in the Los Angeles experience. We did this in under 3 hours, but you should leave more time so that you aren't rushed through the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denisehM5346QA
50,Beautiful night scenary,Magnificent night scenery. We missed the telescope though as it actually close at 9.30pm when the other exhibits close at 10pm. Need a lot of patience to find parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Toorak6

40,"Great view of the city, lots of fun diverse things to do","From its great views at the Observatory to the cute railroad museum at the base, this has got to be one of the most outstanding urban parks in the world. Sometimes parking is a bit rough, and there could be better food served (why only cheapo, unimaginative National Park-style snack bars in one of the most imaginative cities in the world).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Burbatana
50,Great trails,"Wonderful park with great trails with views of LA and the ocean. When we went in December, it was very crowded and was difficult just to get into the park let alone park the car. Would recommend you go early or on weekday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pridewillkill
40,Be prepared for a hike,"It is a great place to go, definitely historic. Occasionally the observatory will set up telescopes that anyone can use. I recommend going with walking shoes, the amount of people that the observatory attracts you will have to park far down the mountain and walk up to the observatory. It is a gorgeous walk and not a reason to avoid the observatory. Night can get a bit cold, I recommend wearing multiple layers. There is parking at the top of the hill for the disabled. It is free to enter but you have to pay for the show.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ellisinla
40,Great time killer while waiting for work associate,I was waiting for someone to fly in and had 5 hours to kill so I came up to the park. Even though it was only 10:00 am on a Sunday the park was starting to get packed and parking was at a premium. I went to the Observatory area and it was informative. The park is laced with packed dirt trails all over the place. I decided to hike the Mt. Hollywood Hiking Trail. It was a 5 mile roundtrip and climbed up 900 feet in elevation. The hike kicked my rear but it was great exercise and good views. Be sure to leave bread crumbs because the trails are many and it is easy to get turned around. Fun hikes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trafcon
40,Great views of Los Angeles from here,"The day we visited, on a Sunday, there was a lot of visitors and it was a long slow drive up the hill but it was worth it!

50,A must see! Good view of Hollywood sign.,"Park is large with numerous activities available. Can drive to observatory and have very good views of LA area.

40,Green Oasis with a view,Griffith Park is a great spot to put the large urban LA area into perspective. We went on a clear afternoon and could see all of the LA area down to the ocean.

A lot to see and enjoy .,"As if Griffith Park didn´t offer enough to enjoy all year around, I showed up just before Christmas to enjoy the annual Festival of Lights in the evening. . A real treat . Crowded but still accesible and enjoyable. In the afternoon ,went to the train museum and rode on the miniature train around the area. Other reviewers have raved about the hiking trails and the Observatory and they are correct. Place is a real jewel .Go to the Dell, a green and shady trail and find to your amazement a running stream ! Place is good for several visits if you are from out of town .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ordinaire3051
40,Wonderful Walks,The park is full of outstanding paths for walking/running and you could spend whole days exploring the trails. It's a must visit for views of the hills and over the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whijo598
50,Trails are well maintained,"Spend some time in this gem in the middle of the city. Hike, go to the observatory, take in the views of Los Angeles. Magical place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/697dianneh
50,Inner City Haven,You will not be disappointed! Do not just drive through although making it to the Observatory is a treat in itself. You need to get out and walk the area to appreciate the view. You need to look up the history of the park and it is pretty interesting if you are a history buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PCourt2015
40,late afternoon hike with the family,"Great hiking path for a walk to see the LA skyline. The drive was slow as there was a tonne of traffic the Friday we went. thinking it was Christmas day we thought it would be a good time to go, but there was a fair amount of traffic. A road was out which I think was why we couldn't drive up to the conservatory like we wanted to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bartleyg04
30,Good night view,"This is the trail where you can see the night view of los angeles. unfortunately, there are no other street light so i felt a little bit dangerous but overall it was fine. you can take shuttle which costs 50 cent because sometimes you cannot park at the top of the hill so you may have to park your car on the way to go to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minimize940314
40,Morning walks,This area was a great place to walk every morning while visiting relatives. The dogs loved it and the views were great. Such a big greenspace in a populated area. Easy to get to with plenty of parking. The area has lots of grounds keepers to help keep it clean for our enjoyment.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ptrjw60
40,Hike and see So Cal chaparral plants,"Great hiking uphill on wide, dirt trails. Great introduction into Southern California chaparral, but the area is disturbed and filled with hikers, so you won't see much wildlife. Nice to experience nature in such a big busy city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimberlyu390
50,Griffith Park at night,"We visited Griffith park on Xmas night. Unfortunately the observatory was closed, but the view was outstanding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Meyrav
50,Magnificent!!!,It's huge and has lots to offer in the way of visuals. I'd recommend this to anyone who visits LA. It humanizes the city.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EssenceM
50,Trains of all Sizes,"What are you waiting for? Dress up the kids and head over to Travel Town at Griffith Park. Why? First, it's a museum. Second, you can actually climb on some of them. Third, it's free!It's a great place to take you kids and let them run and look at former working trains. And how the transportation industry at one-time depended on these wonderful works of iron and steel.You can also plan a ""train"" birthday at the site. Please be sure to call the park ahead of time for reservations.But if you've never been, go, and take a look what the past use to be like.Fun for all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycelynnq
40,Small trail in the heart of LA,The highest hill in LA where you can make trial walking or hiking. Worth to get to the top where you can see the view of LA but need at least 4 hrs for roundtrip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pookiemonster19
20,Disappointing,The Autry Center is well worthwhile but the rest of the park is not. Even the view from the observatory is overrated as it is better from the Getty Center.

The total distance from walking the loop is one mile but you can take the trail (steep) up to the observatory for a total of four miles and the view from the observatory is hard to beat.

40,Serene and scenic,"The look into the boulevard is really amazing as it has all the possible beauty angles to it. Best time being around sunset, lot of pictures can be taken.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenmon09
50,A must visit while in LA,Great views of the city and Hollywood sign. Take a drive up to the observatory and enjoy the view or take a hike from the trail starting near the observatory. Nice trails for walking from several locations around the park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/445eriks
50,Park for all ages.,Love the varieties of outdoor activities you can enjoy in the park. the drive around the park is enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rudy-R283
50,a must see on our trip to California,"This park was a must see on our trip to California, although time didn't allow us a chance to full enjoy this beautiful green space it was apparent by the number of people that this is one of the few amazing places to escape from the busy city. Just driving through the park was a very peaceful experience, once you enter this park a sense of calmness surrounds you and you feel like you're hundreds of miles from any city. The drive through this park allows you to see just how vast an area this really is enjoyable at the least!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheresaM382
50,real eye opener,I wanted to see this place since I lived in LA 30yrs ago so return visit was definitely going to include this and I wasn't disappointed in fact all 4 of us were very pleased with what it showed us. It started as a quick visit to keep the old man (me) happy and ended up as being a 5hr (could have been longer) experience which everybody thoroughly enjoyed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CordonGordon
40,Walking Around The Obeservatory,"Griffith Park is huge considering it is right there in the city of Los Angeles. There is no entry fee to the park or observatory and it has nice areas for sitting and enjoying a lazy afternoon and miles & miles of hiking trails. On the trails you can see the occasional sign warning of rattlesnakes but I didn't manage to spot a single one. There is plenty of other wildlife though, such as birds and bats which I did spot a few of.Near the Griffith observatory, on the trails directly below, there are fantastic views of downtown LA and the views from the trails above (where you can get a good look at the famous Hollywood sign) are spectacular after sunset, you can see the observatory and the city both illuminated.The amount of parking is not massive although the roads through the park offer extra and if you're walking away from the roads you won't even notice it really, although your legs might if you're unlucky enough to go when it is very busy! The area is in the hills and even the roads can feel like tough going if you're not used to walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobinGraves
40,Beautiful place,Very beautiful! We drove the and it is a pleasant park to visit. The nature there is clearly well taken care of.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marianahelp
50,Most excellent views of Los Angeles,"Besides the great views of Los Angeles from high on the mountain side, the facility has a wonderful show and great museum pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnsstein
50,"Amazing View, All Free","How can the Griffith Park observatory be anything other than 5*, it's free to enter, free view of the city, free information and exhibits. Brill. Can be a mare to drive up to, busy, queues etc, but for a free visit you can hardly complain.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353VanessaA
50,Favorite place in LA to hike plus great views of the city,This is one of the biggest gems LA has to offer. There are endless miles of trails and great views of the city. Check out the views from the Observatory or go up to the Magic Tree. Grab a map from the ranger station if you're not familiar with the trails. There are hard trails and easy trails alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/illini2000_LA
40,Place to visit at night,It is really nice to see how the LA city is so huge when you is in Griffith building!! Great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suelyne
50,Beautiful,"The grounds were beautiful, nice place to see the entire city from the Hollywood Hills. Nice place to picnic and the price is right.....FREE",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doreenl835

50,Awesome views,Awesome view over Los Angeles and Hollywood. Very close to Hollywood sign! Good photo opportunities! Good hiking trails.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjaK

50,Great Views,"Always tends to be very busy at weekends, so to help park and enjoy with less crowds try to miss sat and Sunday! Great views of downtown LA and Griffith Observatory is a fabulous building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrewt3233
50,Griffith Observatory,Definitely make the voyage to the Griffith Observatory on a clear day. You can enjoy the park as well as other nice outdoor activities. The area can get super crowded and parking can be tough at the top of the mountain near the observatory. Many park along the road leading up to it and walk the rest of the way. Once there you have great views of LA and some great educational info available inside the museum in addition to the actual observatory itself. Its a fun place to go on a date or couple and very fun place to bring the kids,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zzixor1
50,Great for tourists and residents alike,"As a resident of Koreatown, I hike here several times a week. With miles of trails consisting of various difficulty levels and beautiful views, this is one of my favorite LA spots. The trails around Griffith Observatory always have a lot of hikers, but if you venture north, there are fewer people. The main attractions within the park are the Observatory, Zoo, and the old zoo. The old zoo is worth investigating if you have the time. All of the deserted cages and buildings make for an interesting walk. The only complaint I have is that most of trails are exposed to the sunlight, making it a hot hike during the summer months. Therefore, bring your sunblock.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregoryu874
20,BEWARE,"Griffith Park can be a wonderful place. It is a huge park in the middle of Los Angeles with plenty to see and do. There is a big zoo on one side, The Gene Autry Museum across from that. There is Travel Town with trains children of all ages can climb on with Walt Disneys office also there. There are pony rides and you can rent horses and ride through the park. There is an old carousal that is wonderful. On the other side is Ferndale where there are lovely paths along a stream. Also, the Greek Theater is there as is a driving range and large golf courses.The two stars is because it is not safe. Mothers, do not let you children go into the bathrooms by themselves. There are preditors in them. There are men meeting for illicit purposes. There are condoms lying on the hiking paths. Men are parked all along the roads, waiting for other men to perform (acts) on each other.They are all along the hiking trails. I am not exaggerating. I worked for the police dept. many years and saw all the reports and extra patrols. I see it out there because I am aware of this problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ninachka1
50,Favorite LA Park,I have to visit every time I go to LA. The views are beautiful. My favorite thing to do there is sit and have a cup of coffee while enjoying the view of downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GriselleMM
50,Great place,Great place to take the kids out of the busy city. We found a carousel and a great kids park. Also horse rides and icecreams. Great place for a picnic and a few ball games. I love taking my boys here when in los angeles,
50,Solo Female Traveler,"Bring lots of water and go for a walk. You get a great vantage point of housed in the Hollywood Hills as well as the HOLLYWOOD sign. You can ride the Merry Go Round, take the shuttle on Saturday and Sunday for $10.00, rent a bike, bring your pets for a walk, have a picnic, etc...what a great setting. Those that live in Los Angeles are fortunate to have this park, what a gem! The observatory is at the top of the road inside Griffith Park.",
40,Great stop in LA,"Unbelievably gorgeous and enormous park.. Parked at the lot for the Bronson Canyon trail and encounted a film shoot at the Bronson Caves. Cooled off in the gorgeous Fern Dell where they were setting up a film shoot for the next day--this must be Hollywood!! Enjoyed incredible sandwiches & pie at the Trails cafe and experienced incredible views at Griffith Observatory. In hindsight, probably should have just hiked up to the Observatory since we had to park half way down the road in any event! This park is a wonderful gem and wish we had more time to explore it!",
50,An Oasis of a Park,"One of the largest urban parks in any major city, Griffith Park offers biking trails, hiking trails, and numerous playgrounds for all ages. Friendly families frequent the playgrounds. A train museum, zoo, and carousel ride can also be found amongst it's grounds. On a Sunday afternoon, one can find a group of loyal drummers who gather and fill the park with a rhythm that awakens one's passions.",
50,Fun in the park,Nice place to walk around. Interesting Shakespeare in the park area. The old zoo was fun to explore.,
50,Great place!,Loved it!! However as an astronomy buff I'm partial to the observatory. That being said the park is a large place with many things to do beyond the observatory . Plenty of places to have a picnic or just to get away from the hustle bustle of downtown Los Angeles,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F3810NFstevew
50,Unbelievable Park in LA,"This is a great place, its hard to believe that there is a park like this, in the city. I walked around the park, (not the whole thing) it has a bunch of great little hidden places. Its very ""California"", real laid back, with dedicated hard core park goers that frequent it. I went on a Friday, parking was really easy,and made my way through the different trails. In one place there was a stream, where you see little ""crawfish"", its very cool. It is worth the time to hike around there, and if you feel adventurous, there are some strenuous hike to participate in. (I left that to the more fit in my family).Enjoy it!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/2lifeadventure
50,Amazing,During the day the scenery and some wildlife is beautiful. The view is great at night and it is really peaceful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janeanp2014
40,More than a Park,"Griffith Park is a very large area encompassing part of the San Fernando Valley and into the Hollywood area. It includes the L.A. Zoo, multiple picnic area, horseback riding, traintown, the Observatory and multiple hiking areas. It is a beautiful area, well worth it. Some great views from the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelbH8204CN
50,you should go!,"you should stop here and enjoy the views. especially at night, its just beautiful. you will enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Italiana84
40,Great view,"It was a great view, although depending on the time of year, I would go later in evening or at night, as early morning was hazy and not good visibility, around 10:30am on 9/5/15. But very scenic park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466grega
50,Beautiful Place,"the most beautiful experience with the nature, we are not nature persons, but this place is iver, great, good for a romantic sunset",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808colinc
50,One of the best parks in LA!,"This is one of my favorite places to hike in LA! Located right in the East Hollywood Hills spanning all the way to the 5 freeway, this park is massive, yet gorgeous. I might be a little biased because I live within walking distance, but there is lots here to do besides hiking. You can picnic, play tennis, golf, horseback ride, and there is even a merry-go-round here, in addition to the famed Observatory,the Greek Theatre, the LA Zoo, and the Autry Museum...which is one of my favorite museums in LA. If you visit LA this is a must visit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thisgirl_Gray
50,The highlight of our vacation!,"Visiting Griffith Park was hands down my favorite thing that we did on our trip to LA. The downside: went on a weekend so the observatory was very crowded. You could barely move from room to room and see the exhibits, and the grounds were filled with people trying to pose and snap a picture of the Hollywood sign. However, there were far more positives to note: the park itself is on a mountain, so there are breathtaking views in any direction from the observatory itself. I thought the hiking trails would be crowded too, but we found that most people hike up to the first curve in the path, and then turn around. We hiked about 2.5 miles to the small peaks and lookout areas. The views were incredible--absolutely like nothing I had ever seen. You can see the entire city, the boulevards stretching towards the ocean, celebrity mansions tucked away in the hills, and the infamous Hollywood Sign in close proximity. You can even see down into the valley and get a glimpse of Glendale. What's more, since most people don't hike up to the lookout areas, it was very peaceful and quiet! Make sure you bring water--it's hot up there. Also, the whole park has wifi, so when you snap that perfect selfie at the top of the summit, you can post it to social media with ease (ha ha). If you're looking for an easy hike, to work on your tan, or to catch some stellar views, I strongly urge you to visit Griffith Park. Pro tip: don't drive there. There is a shuttle on Sundays that takes you all the way up and back down the mountain and drops you off downtown. They run about every 15 minutes, and they cost a dollar per person roundtrip. Spare yourself the headache of attempting to parallel park your car on the side of a windy road...we heard many a car alarm go off!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hhayleytodd
50,Hike,Really nice place to explore. My friends and I parked the car and walked all the way up. Once we got to the top is was really nice to over look the city. Felt amazing being away from all the crazy noses that city has. I definitely will be hiking that again,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ExploringGipsy44
50,Another Don't Miss!,"Call ahead or go online and buy the family membership/or single...Saves on the tours, observatory events, and gift shop. A No-Brainer. The membership sends out special events several times a year, that are incredibly cool! You'll have notice way before the general public, including special small group tours all ove the world!The daily astronomy shows are absolutely wonderful; for all ages! I would have to say better than the Air & Space IMAX in Washington, DC. They're equally terrific; perhaps it's the different venue's...East Coast/West Coast?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clearbrook6
50,Worth a visit if you are in LA and so close to all the action,Greak hiking and facilities. A beautiful park full of many trail options. Great views of the Hollywood sign,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nab025
50,Be prepared to walk,"We decided to go here on the spur of the moment. The drive up the mountain to the observatory at the top is pretty. The park gets really crowded as it gets closer to sundown and it can be hard to find a parking spot near the top, so be prepared to walk. Once you get there, however, the view is spectacular. You can see the Hollywood sign from here as well as look out over downtown LA and the surrounding areas. The observatory is awesome and you might be lucky enough to get some astronomers setting up the telescopes which are open to public viewing. While there, we were able to see the star Vega even though it was still daylight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdelahalle
40,"Dears, Wolves and the Greek","Home to a family of dears and a pride of wolves, just up from the Greek Theatre and down the hill from Griffith Observatory. A great place to park and walk up the hill to the observatory if you don't mind a bit of a hike",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidsL7053XW
50,Can't beat the view!,We decided last minute to trek up to the top and we are certainly glad that we did! We walked the whole perimeter and we were able to see some breath taking views,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifermP3871SW
50,Hike to the Hollywood Sign!!,"If you're up for a good hike, the 3 mile trek to the Hollywood Sign is worth every effort!!! Do some research to locate the entrance, take a backpack with water & snacks, and go early. You really can get into nature in the middle of LA! The Batman Cave is supposed to be off this same path, but we did not take the time to go there. There are no bathrooms/port-a-lets along this long hiking route. It is definitely desert, so wear appropriate gear. Griffeth Park is huge, there are hiking trails for all levels, you just have to do the research.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedRunner71
50,Fantastic views!!,"I went here on a Sunday afternoon it was a great experience and fantastic views over the city. The walkways through Griffith Park are great. However, I thought you could get a good picture of the Hollywood sign from Griffith Park but it is still quite a distance away. So try not make that mistake if you are looking to get a close up picture of the sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lukeb364
40,Don't go off trail!,"The proper area is great and you get some incredible views. Please take the time to go. You can walk to the Hollywood Sign from here but please don't try. Nor can you drive across to collect the fools in your party who decide to persevere, so they have to walk back all by themselves!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Madmumatuk
50,Great spot,"You have to walk in because bikes and cars cannot go in. History history so many movies shot here, John Wayne, batman series and original Star Trek. All that aside it's beautiful with the caves and mountains. Loved the view of the Hollywood sign. If you can don't miss out on this spot. By far one of my fav's!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justmyimpression

50,Wonderful views and interesting displays,This attraction is free to enter. The displays are really good and every interesting. THere are also staff walking around who were happy to provide additional information about what you were looking at. Once you are outside the views are quite amazing and well worth the drive for this alone.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/833justinc
40,Amazing views of LA. Great Experience!,"We were visiting LA from London and I was determined to visit this place as I had read so much about it. We drove up there one evening to catch the sunset. I couldn't believe how busy it was!! Parking was quite tricky but we managed to find a space half way down the hill and then had to walk up again. My kids were not impressed... Anyway, it was worth it when we go to the top. Amazing views and great sunset. You also get a view of the Hollywood sign. They also had telescopes on the lawn at the front and we got an amazing view of the planet Venus! Well worth a visit, but make sure you bring comfortable walking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3788QBkatem
50,Must see,A good and leisurely hike to the top. parked our car at the bottom car park only to realise we could have parked higher up!but it's worth it people are very accommodating .

50,Griffith Park is a haven in the city,"Griffith park is very centrally located to many areas in Los Angeles. It is easy to get to and once you're there you feel like you have left the city. Griffith park has many hiking and running trails as well as horse trails. It has one of the best zoo's in the country, the Los Angeles Zoo. It has the observatory where you can also hike to the Hollywood sign. It has a merry go round, and Travel Town a free and beautiful place to see trains of the past. It has many picnic areas and playgrounds. It's a great place to visit while in Los Angeles or like myself who lives here it's a great place to feel nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bono2011
30,Nice views,"We grabbed an uber to the top which I would recommend however it's difficult to book one going back down. The wifi in the park was patchy and we couldn't get the app to work. Couple that with the super slow ride to the top meant we were pretty much stuck there. The ""shuttle"" bus doesn't go all the way down and the staff seemed neither willing or able to help us. Luckily we grabbed a ride with some helpful locals. Besides the transport difficulty it was a great spot to grab some pictures",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacV9034JN

Inside the observatory is filled with information about the earth, galaxies and other space related programs. There are so much to see and enjoy. You will not regret your time there. Try to get there early since the parking is limited specially if you want to be closer to the observatory. If you have time after visiting you can hike up for some great views",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marcj220

It has a very nurturing and refreshing feel after miles of hot concrete and its a good place to jog,picnic,ride the carousel ,visit the Gene Autry museum or simple hang and relax. I do not recommend it at night. It is dog friendly There are children around and you must pick up.It is a very popular haven for Angelenos to expand and relaxafter dealing with L.A. which is extremely stressful particularly driving, parking and paying the rent . Griffith park is a great relaxation spot, so if you get exhausted with sight seeing,pick up a deli lunch and relax in rich green grass and shade. let your fatigue drain away into mother Earth until you are ready for your fun evening.but oscowrs0e0 you have to pick up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T7453DTmarkk

50,"Great place to hike, safe, but beware traffic","Don't not even try to go as a casual hiker any day after 3pm when a concert at the Greek is being held, you will be stuck in traffic forever if you try to go up to the Conservatory.

50,Wonderful place to experience. Great views of LA,This is a place everyone should experience in LA. The views in the day time or night are superb. And the museum has lots to offer anyone to learn about astronomy and outside you can chill out and walk around with breath taking views. The food is pretty decent but could use some more variety.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericmV9029PW

40,Huge!,Huge park! There are different sections of this park so you may have to drive around to get to what you want to see. Took the kids to the carousel (just $2/ride) and they loved it.

The views and park areas were beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TXRanney76

Thanks to Eric - you did a great job. It is a must do activity if you visit LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/torbenm2014
50,Mentally Miles Away,"Griffith Park is about as LA as it gets. I have been going here since I was a baby, and I am still finding new trails and interesting vistas. It may be geographically in the middle of the city, but mentally couldn't be more far away. If you are visiting LA and need a break from the hustle and bustle of the city, take a hike in Griffith Park and experience the ""real"" LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USAFRLV
40,options for all the family. great outdoor space,This park is huge and houses LA zoo and a museum. Also golf course pony rides and mini trains as well as huge outdoor locomotive museum. This time jogged here on the sandy trails which during the day are busy but this means likelihood of getting lost minimal. You can picnic and parking is free. A great alternative to the concrete of los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/699veras
40,City Mountain Hike and More,"Griffith Park can definitely be an all fun excursion. Not to mention you get in your exercise for the day. You have to get there early to find parking near the observatory in order for you to begin your hike. The hike is an easy one but since there isn't any shade take water, sunblock and a hat. There are a few trails but the most popular one ends at the top of a mountain and has a 360 overlook. Just follow the crowd to the top. After your hike, you can either take a lunch break with the lunch you packed or go into the the observatory and have lunch there. The restaurant is okay. The rest of the day you can walk through the observatory. It shouldn't take more than an hour to get through it all unless you walk really slow and like to stop and read everything; then expect to get home really late. For dinner you can yelp one of the many restaurants around the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Destination555
50,A trail running mecca,"Seemingly endless miles of running trails with lots of elevation changes. Easy to get lost in the Park, so using GPS or taking a map would be a big plus. Drinking fountains scattered occasionally, which is indispensable on a hot day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AkrontravelerAkron
50,Great place for photography,"Assisted with a wedding engagement shoot, and we had lots of options for backgrounds. It's a good mix of light forest and woodland. People wouldn't guess you were shooting in the heart of Los Angeles. Parking is hit or miss on the weekend, bathrooms can be found and they are decent, lots of pick nick people but you can shoot around them. As a bonus this is also a good place to shoot some light wildlife.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hellsumz

50,"Very cool, especially at night.","My kids and I visited before sunset and stayed just until after sunset.First of all, parking is tricky but don't give up early. Go all the way to the top and see if you can find parking before giving up. I've watched people park half-way down the hill knowing that there were parking spots being freed up in the parking lot near the observatory.Make sure to check out the views from the roof, walk all around and then spend some time in the observatory itself. There are cool exhibits about the change of seasons, changes in tide, lighting, etc.The coolest version of the periodic table is at the observatory.If this all sounds nerdy, perhaps it is, but it's a lot of fun, as well.Lastly, it's all FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmathew22
50,Always someplace new to explore,"I hike here often and even if you don't hike there are things to do. Plenty of picnic areas, great for outdoor parties, activities for kids. If you're hiking make sure to bring water because it can be hot in the sun but usually a nice breeze if it's later in the day or evening. So many trails, you could hike all day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S5357RZlauram
50,Great place,"This park can serve so many purposes - hiking, strolling, family and friends gatherings. We used to come here when my kids were little, and now it's our favorite place to spend time with our little grandson.

It's clean, plenty parking spaces, the rides are reasonable priced, clean bathrooms. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InnaC727
40,Great hiking trails - but easy to get lost!,"We had intended to hike to the Hollywood sign from the Beachwood access point, but it was closed so we drove to the Observatory. We didn't really see any maps, so we just started in the general direction, asking everyone we saw if we were going in the right direction. The trails were well groomed and wide, but are definitely not well marked with any guide points as to where you are. We got a few helpful tips, but one sent us off on the wrong tangent and we found ourselves on a tangled, winding, steep trail that took us eventually to the paved road to the Hollywood sign. We took a different route back - longer but mostly paved. What we had intended to be a 3.5 mile hike ended up being 8.4 miles. The scenery and views of Hollywood and the valley were beautiful, however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/apersistent1
40,Griffith Park Oberservatory - great hike and educational,"I really enjoyed visiting this Park and the hike up to the observatory. I found it very educational with all the exhibits and found it fascinatining with how the universe was created, astronomy, the moon, stars and the different chemicals that made up the atmosphere. The admission to the Park was free but if you choose to watch planetarium shows at the observatory you will have to pay $7 (adults) andThere are different hiking trails up to the observatory and I went in June on a really hot day so bring water, suncreen and comfortable walking shoes.At the top of the observatory you have a great view of city of LA and the Hollywood Sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andyt42

50,Park with views!,"This park is quite large! There were areas with families picnicking, trails for ripple to run on. Lots of free parking lining the street. You have to go up to the observatory. It's free outside and has great views of LA and the Hollywood sign. Bring lots of water, it gets hot up there. They do have decent bathrooms and drinking fountains in the parking area by the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Williamsland
50,Nature Escape in LA,"Griffith Park is great. I spend a lot of time in the park. There are many access points with many highlights. You can visit the observatory with great views of the city during day or night. You can also go inside and check out the exhibits. I like to park here an take a hike up the mountain in the morning.There is also the Greek Theater which is wonderful for outdoor concerts. You can also park near there for nice walks up the mountain.On the east side of the park you can access many areas for picnics. There's a great area for kids with a tiny train ride, pony rides and a carousel. There is also the LA Zoo and Autry Western Museum in the park.It's a great place to spend the afternoon relaxing. You can spend a couple hours in the park or an entire afternoon or even day here.** TIP ** If you are going to the Observatory on a weekend night in the summer, expect traffic. Check and see first if there is a concert that night at the Greek. IF there is, traffic will be crazy and can take over an hour to get to the top. The solution is to go before the traffic between 5-6pm and watch the sunset. Then leave after you look through the observatory and traffic has settled down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Xhico
50,Perfect Park all around,"Griffith park is close to my heart. I have spent countless gatherings, birthday parties, and long afternoons by the merry go round with my hubby and dog picnicking or BBQing with friends. You can ride horses, hike, hang, etc. My fave spot is by the Merry Go Round and tennis courts. The grounds are well maintained and when the weather is right, you can stay for hours on end. Plus it's free and a great place to people watch. Never rode the horses, but I always saw groups heading up the mountains on horseback.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RinaTravelsWorld
50,Fun hike,"Quite a few ways to enter the park, but I usually take the one off Los Feliz, park at the first lot and hike up. Its fun - you can go to the Hollywood sign or the Observatory.

50,Great place to spend the day,"We got dropped off at the entrance to the park and hiked up to the observatory - a great place to see the hollywood sign.It was an easy hike, but steep at some points and very hot / dusty during summer. It only took 20 - 30 mins to reach the observatory at a leisurely pace.There are lots of great trails, but unfortunately there is minimal signage.

50,Best views in Hollywood?,"I went here mainly to hike up the hills up the the Griffith Observatory to get a good view of the Hollywood sign.The hike up was amazing and I had lots of good viewpoints where I could look out over the city. There is quite a lot of people walking in this area, so you never feel unsafe.The park is pretty close from downtown Hollywood, so it felt really nice to be able to do some hiking even if you're so close to the city itself.Spend the whole day here since you want to see the sign at daytime and the lights from the city at night. If you don't feel like walking down the hill at night, there is buses going back to the city from the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielHenrysson

40,Great Park To Getaway from the Hustle & Bustle,"What a great little respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. The trails are pretty, albeit dusty in some areas. Many dogs being walked and couples taking a stroll. I spent about an hour walking around the area and found it peaceful.

50,Great hikes in Griffiths Park,I did not hike myself but my husband and daughter headed out to Griffith everyday and were gone for hours. My daughter lives near the Park and often posts photos on Facebook of her early morning treks to the Observatory. Good job LA for protecting such a large recreational space for your urban residents.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donna27272015
40,Many things to do!,"Griffith Park has the Zoo, Autry Museum, Travel Town & L.A. Steamers. Plus, carousel & pony rides. The place is huge, so you'll need a car. I'm unaware of a free shuttle or anything like that, but, if you're planning a visit, check it out 1st (I live here, so I always drive; parking is free). Great place to visit but I advise going online & deciding what you want to do & find out hours & admission times to those places within Griffith Park (some are free, some are open limited hours, etc).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332marleneh

50,"Will travel back to LA, just to return here!!!!","We only had a couple of hours to spare here but are so glad we did. We enjoyed visiting the abandoned zoo area and the light hiking the paved trails offered. The views up the hill are amazing. There was such a wide variety of people all enjoying the same place, which truly seems to have something for everyone. If I had to guess I'd say we saw maybe a quarter of what the park had to offer. My advice is plan to spend the better part of a day and bring some food, to really enjoy everything this park has to offer. The crazy thing is this experience was completely free and better than all of the places we PAID to visit on our short trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CovAmy

10,Weekend Traffic at the Observatory! Warning!,"Apparently timing is everything with this venue. Tried to visit mid-day on a Sunday. Oooops. About two miles before the observatory, the winding road suddenly started filling on each side with parked cars... the previously slow traffic ground to a halt, and we saw people getting out of the parked cars and making the slow trek toward the observatory.Before we were parked in, we bailed, and Y-turned quickly and motored back down the hill. I estimated the observatory was another hour or two from where we turned back. I would go back, but when there's not such a traffic problem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/michaelsD6450XZ

40,"Horses and the train, south end of park","We bring our toddlers here to ride fast horses and it is so, so much fun! The horses are not on a harness and they trot around a rather large track with guides running beside the horses. It is hysterical to watch your kid hold on while the ponies trot! And there is a cute train (small scale, like an amusement park ride) that the kids love, too. Great for kids 2 years and upwards.Griffith park is enormous so be sure you are at the very southern end of the park for these two attractions. At the very northern end is a train yard--NOT what I am rating here. Kids like that, too but it is much less adventuresome and there are lots of kid birthday parties to contend with. Personally, I like the attractions on the southern end the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oohlaalaa
40,A relaxing day at the park~,"My family and I (including 3 small kids who are 3, 6, and 8) go to the Griffith Park almost always when we are in the L.A area to.visit my parents. The Griffith Park is a very good place to visit snd to relax. Also, unlike other attractions and places to visit in the L.A. area, there is little. Or no costs involved (other than meals...). Last year, we went to the Griffith Park Observatory. This is a good place to go to see all of L.A. from the mountain top. This time, we visited the Pony Rides, minature train ride at Southern Railroads, Merry-Go-Round, and the playground at Shane's Inspiration. The kids enjoyed all the activities. The pony ride, miniature train ride, and merry-go-round charged fees, but the fees were very reasonable (US$3 per person for the pony ride, US$2.75 per person for the miniature train ride, and US$2 per person for the merry-go-round). All in all, the Griffith Park with various activities and places to visit is a great place to spend a day in L.A., esp. with kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saesolbyeol

50,Classic Los Angeles at Its Best,"Whether you live in Southern California or are visiting this is a must-see. You would be wise to take more than one day. My first visit was in the early 1950's, and I still love going. Within Griffith Park are the Autry National Center and the Los Angeles Zoo, but there is also Travel Town, the Observatory, a mini-railroad, horseback riding, pony rides, The Greek Theater, hiking trails, Fern Dell, picnic areas, golf courses, and more.One of my favorite areas does not have an entrance fee and does not cost anything. That is Fern Dell. It is a picturesque path with a brook that is heavily planted with ferns. During the heat of the summer it can be more than 10 degrees cooler than the surrounding area. It is a great place for children of all ages to spend a few hours. They are no longer plentiful, but if you look carefully you can find both dragonflies, and tadpoles in season and frogs later in the season.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932BrendaG

40,So Much to See and Do!,"I spent the day at Griffith Park doing photography with some friends. There are plenty of places to shoot. We explored the old zoo cages, many which are kind of creepy and covered with graffiti. There is also an amazing vintage carousel for kids and adults alike. Tickets are only $2.00.Afterwards we went to the Griffith Park Observatory. I hadn't been there since the remodeling was finished, which I believe was just a couple of years ago. The parking is unfortunately way worst than it used to be. We got there in the early afternoon and basically had to hike in. But, at least parking is free!The inside of the observatory has been extensively remodeled and now has a basement area full of very interesting and interactive planetary exhibits. I'm amazed at how comprehensive it is.The observatory also has a nice cafeteria where you can buy drinks and food. Prices didn't seem to be out of the stratosphere.

We didn't hike but we thought about it! Plan for a couple of hours and get active.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ikirol
30,Pony and Train Rides,"We took the family on a Friday morning to see what it was all about and get the kids out of the house. Parking was free, close and easy. The rides were reasonable at $3 each. However, for the mid-size ponies it was a pretty long wait. I did hear someone say that they had never seen it so crowded there. It's understandable in order to save the backs of their employees, but they do not load and unload all the children after every ride. If all of the children ahead of you have 12 ride tickets, they will be allowed to stay and ride 12 times before having to come off. This made for a LONG wait for my 5 year old. She was a trooper and it wasn't a problem, but I could see how it could be for some children. Still, if the park was unusually crowded that day, maybe the lines are not usually quite so long. My daughter absolutely loved every second of her 2 rides. She did not stop laughing and smiling the whole time. Her pony took off on a nice little trot for a moment, but she was very secure in her belt and she thought it was fun! I was very impressed with the gentle little ponies they used for the babies. Those tiny children were buckled in and the ponies just turned around and headed for their track slow and gentle. It was adorable. The train ride was nice. We had a day with nice weather and it was a pleasant ride through the trees. They obviously tried to make it interesting with some store fronts for a western town added at one point, but you can tell there isn't a lot of time for the upkeep. You also get a view of the other ponies in their pens. Some of this looks a little cluttered and messy, but hey, it isn't Disneyland. There is a food area with the option to get a hot lunch. It is a bit pricey for what they offered but that's typical for amusement areas. I had tacos that were pretty tasty, two on a plate for $4.50. They werent skimpy on the meat. Seemed like the best deal compared to one corn dog for $3. All in all a pretty good day without breaking the bank. My 5 year old thought the whole thing was amazing and in the end, thats what its all about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/8melissaz
50,"LA's Central Park, but bigger and more to do...but you have to drive here....","Griffith Park is home to the famous Observatory, where Rebel Without a Cause was filmed, with views to the ocean a few times a year...actually saw Catalina Island in the distance in February - the day after it rained. There are amazing views to downtown LA and across the basin; it really gives you a sense of the vast city. Also, there are a multitude of trails, too many to disclose - go to the official website or just wander - you can even walk closer to the Hollywood Sign than you will ever be able to drive to. Or do go to the ranch, think on Beachwood Canyon, where you can rent horses and ride around the trails. Fun to do with tourists - gives them a sense of being in the middle of nowhere, while actually being in the heart of the city!.On the back side of the hill, there is the LA ZOO, old LA zoo, the carousel, a golf course, cafes, a train museum, that I keep meaning to visit. Many people use it for family picnics, and it is a short-cut from Burbank to Los Feliz Blvd, where you can snake your way down, mirroring the 5, to Dodger Stadium, Chinatown etc.It is a place that most Angelenos know about, but few go, unless they have visitors in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YvonneM806

You have to take a 45 minute hike (very easy) up to a spot that gives you a good view of it. I thought we'd be really close to it but that is not the case. You are actually pretty far away. There are two different paths you can take, either a front view or a back view. We did the front view. I don't think the back view gets you any closer. It was still worth it. Great views of the city. I would do it again to see the back view. There are also other trails to hike (Batman's Cave) that I would like to do. Whatever way you choose to go Don't forget to brink a water bottle and some good hiking shoes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kittyme2
50,Nice walk to the Observatory,"I walked here from the Best Western Hollywood Hills hotel. It was a hot day but an interesting walk. Plenty of joggers!The Observatory is worth a visit, in particular the Planetarium.It has free Wifi:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Veryafraid
40,Hidden Gem,Griffith park is an awesome place to spend the afternoon. Great place for children with all the interactive things and you can't get a better spot to take a photo of the Hollywood sign then from the parking lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingTarns

50,Popular Landmark...,"The downside to Griffith Park is the traffic to access the park, especially the Zoo. Since this is a popular landmark for families and active individuals, this area often times becomes VERY crowded with auto traffic on the weekends. Plan accordingly for drive and parking time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CynJ22
40,"Great walking trails, views of city and Hollywood sign","We parked for free opposite the Greek theatre and walked up to the highest view point which took us less than an hour at a snails pace. The views were fantastic looking back over the observatory to the city. Got some nice tourist snaps of the Hollywood sign too. Some companies available to do it via horseback which would have been nice but we weren't organised enough. Top tip - take water. There's nowhere to grab any on the walk. Also, it's dusty, wear old trainers! Well worth the couple of hours. The observatory wasn't open until 12 or Wembley have looked inside there too and spent longer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Loxyduc
50,A must see,Excellent view of LA. Get there early if you plan to see sunset otherwise you will be park 20 minutes from the top.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontrealFrenchy
40,Very nice view,"The place has a very nice view to the city and some other interesting thing about the sky (sun, moon, planets etc). Also, it is a very nice place to make exercises and take pictures. The negative point is the parking: if you go by car, probably will need to park in the hill. Prefer to go using a bus tour, they can enter the park and drop you right in the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/896alexandrez
50,Beautiful!,"We drove through Griffith Park on our Day at LA Tour, and we were amazed that it was actually donated with the stipulation that it be kept free to the people to visit.

40,The famous Griffith Park Merry Go Round,"This is the merry go round that houses the original park bench where Walt Disney sat and conceptualized the Disney theme park. The bench is on display.

The horses are all original and amazing to look at, particularly if you're into antiques and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoctorBuckles
50,The view!,The park offers spectacular views of the Hollywood sign as well as downtown Los Angeles. We visited on quite a cloudy day so when it's clear it must be even more spectacular.

30,"LARGE Park, Hard to Find Things","Nice park, but very confusing. Drove and drove, and never knew where we were. Maybe maps or signs at each entrance? Just felt like we wasted a lot of time trying to find things.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rryan313131
40,Griffith Park,"This is truly a special place and has a lot to offer. It is close to the LA Zoo and the Griffith Park Observatory. I used to go on the carousel and pony rides there when I was a kid. Travel town is also a cool attraction that features lots of trains.

40,More than just the observatory,A great urban outing with lots of hiking trails all around the Hollywood Hills. Amazingly enough I did this on a weekend and it was not crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsum73
40,Lovely Park North of Hollywood,"Great place to picnic, drive through etc. My favorite has always been the railroad and the exhibits. I remember meeting a lady there once who had this great big wolf on a chain.I think it had to have been only one quarter wolf to be legal. What was fascinating was her exlanantion of how wolves think. - ie: not like dogs). She also had an older Husky/Malamute-type dog which wolfie looked up to as its leader due to respect for the elderly or somesuch.You get to meet really interesting folks in Griffith Park!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/what666

50,Awesome 'city' park,"There is so much to see and do in Griffith Park, it's hard to put everything under one heading as an attraction. There are great hiking trails. Of course, the namesake Observatory. The zoo, golf courses, horseback riding, a theater, views of the Hollywood sign and the list goes on. You could spend an entire week here and never cross paths. I love it. Hard to believe this much nature can exist this close to the big city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RTWtraveler213

50,Really Great Area,"Probably the best thing we did in LA. Went on a nice day and walked up to the observatory and the continued on up to Mt Hollywood. Was great to get away from the city in some lovely terrain, which is far more natural than New York's Central Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jcheshy5
50,Pleasant time,"It is a nice area. The whole city is peacfull from there. You can make a nice, gentle hiking. If I have some free time I go there at sunset to rest a little bit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/czedlkata
50,Historical Landmark - BEST views,"I typed HOLLYWOOD sign into my GPS, and the directions I was given were to the Observatory (which is a site I wanted to see). The winding roads were a bit scary, but when we got to the top, the views were amazing.We arrived too early (9am), the museum doesn't open til 10am, so we missed our chance to go in. Truly a spectacular site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmiraD_12
40,Fantastic view of LA,"We visited the park on a Saturday afternoon which was a mistake, everybody else was there as well, so if you can, pick a different day. Huge park, lots of walking trails. Our goal was the observatory at the top but we didn't get there since there was no parking (cars parked on both sides of the road almost all the way up/down!) but we did get a nice look at the view of Los Angeles. Will return on a weekday when we can to see the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MiaEJ2013
50,Griffith Park has a wide variety for all types of people!,"From the Greek Theater for a concert to the Zoo and Gene Autry Museum, Griffith Park adds so much to the LA experience. You can go on kiddie or adult horseback riding, or ride the carousel, visit Travel Town (with old train cars and fire engines and a miniature train ride) or Golf. It also has the Observatory which was redone a few years ago and offers young and old an experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/318elainel

50,Fab park but trail is a bit slippery,"Great park, went early and parked at the bottom and hiked up to the observatory. We hiked with the kids and would advise caution as they were slipping all over the place on our way down the hill. I had to help a woman who fell over as the sandy soil was very slippery. Otherwise a lovely way to spend the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobeDaughters
50,Great views of the city,Was an awesome trip to the park with my girlfriend. We intended to just see the observatory but decided to hike around for a while and it was totally worth it!

50,Run on Griffith Park,Although the path to the Griffith Park is not easy for runners - a lot of hills - when you reach the top you will realize the efforts is valid. This is best skyline of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vkingeski
50,Cheap but fun kiddo date!,"If you want to entertain your kids for an afternoon and don't have the hundreds necessary for most California attractions, this place is great!!! Pony rides, hikes, train rides, Ferris wheel and a park. It's Faldo very scenic and beautiful. Our kids were there full day and between mom, dad, and two kids. We stayed under $100 all day!

50,A wonderful L.A. local experience.,"Put this on your list of ""must see'' in Los Angeles. if you are athletic, park at the base and take the path up. The park offers beautiful views of LA, a laid back experience. Limited parking, try to walk up if you are able.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LADouglas

50,What to choose?,Where to start Griffith Park has so much to offer that you never want to leave. I love the carousel that they have and walking thru the old Zoo the options are never ending.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dozoara
50,A Park as big as Sydney,"If you have never been to Griffith Park then you can't imagine the size.It houses The Observatory,The Greek Theatre.Gene Autry's Western Heritage Museum, L.A.Zoo,The Train Museum and probably things we missed.It's also a refuge for the locals to take their families to escape the speed of L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/James2850

50,Worth some time here,The telescopes and history of the place are the main draw. The displays provided me with a good review and supplement to my limited knowledge of the solar system and planets. The view is of course fabulous. The building was remodeled extensively and most would not know by looking at it just what was done and what a feat of engineering it was unless they sit for the film narrated by Leonard Nimoy. We enjoyed it and saw the moons of Jupiter quite easily from a scope set up on the lawn. Visit at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/46MK
50,Great Hike,"This is a review ourely for the hike behind Griffith Observatory. This is a tougher hike depending on what trail you take. This can be a choose your own adventure type of situation. There is one very well worn trail that is wide and easier to hike, but steep. There are other trails you will see branching off this trail that can be steep and difficult and a little slippery with dirt and rocks. The views are stunning throughout and you will get a great view of the Hollywood sign. I highly recommend this. Bring water!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jvalliant
40,A great day in the park,A superb place for a view of the city and the Hollywood sign. However do note that parking could be a slight hassle if you arrive later in the morning. Best thing to happen is FREE WIFI,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZalizanI
40,Nice walk!,"It is a great way to add some exercise to your visit to LA. It is a long and sometimes steep walk, but you get the best view in town of the famous Hollywood sign.

50,the mountains are beautiful,"we walked up the pathway, and we could not get enough of it, looking down on LA was a bit scary at first but we got used to it, you need to take along a bottle of water on a hot day, but its worth the trip up",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zussmans
50,"Griffith Park Observatory, The LA Zoo, The Autry Museum, The Greek and fabulouse hiking","Incredible hikes through the beautiful Santa Monica mountains, the iconic Griffith Park Observatory is a must visit, Trailhead Cafe at the Ferndell entrance to the park does great healthy snacks for the hike up to the Observatory, or you can go on horseback from the stables at the top of Beechwood Canyon - night ride over the mountains to Burbank!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214suzanc
50,Hikes galore,We hiked to the abandoned LA Zoo cages - very cool. We also hiked to Bronson Cave - the site of the Batcave. Great views of the Hollywood sign. Parking is tight. If you see spot take it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emmbeekay
40,Awesome place,"Such a cool park with so much to do. Wish we had more time to hit up some of the trails to hike. We went to find the Hollywood sign which was easy to see from a far. Make this a day trip and hit up one of the many trails, they are pretty awesome looking:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/978natalief

40,Vacation and health,"The annual January birthday trip for me... no Caribbean island this year! Southern Cali didn't disappoint. While we've visited Calie on many a trips, this was our first vacation where we enjoyed our timing going to all of the tourist attractions.the Griffith Park hike was better than Santa Monica Pier, Oceanside beach and the Paramount tour - I'm an nature person and this hike while rather difficult was sooooooo much fun with my teenager who think he's superman and my retired veteran who thinks he's still enlisted!!! We love the difficulty and the views! Not to be missed...Love it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kaebnroh

50,The Jewel of Los Angeles - A Real Must-See,"Spectacular views, excellent hiking, and a superb Observatory make Griffith Park the jewel of Los Angeles, in my opinion. If you have one day, focus on the Observatory, and plan to spend the better part of the day. Priority #1: get tickets to ""Centered In The Universe,"" the best of their Planetarium shows and truly a riveting, inspiring experience, with talented live narrator, high quality script and extraordinary visuals. Well worth $15. The regular exhibits (free!) are very good too, and there's a cafe where you can get lunch. The cafe is nothing to write home about, sandwiches and such, but Griffith Park is so isolated, you can't just pop out for lunch and come back. No problem bringing your own food & having a picnic on the lawn. The views are absolutely spectacular. On a clear day, you really can see forever. Nice gift shop, too: lots of educational toys and great selection of books. Between taking in the exhibits, seeing one or two shows, browsing the shop, having a meal and enjoying the view, you will be happy here for at least four hours.Bring sun protection! There's no shade whatsoever when you are outside the building. If you come from someplace cold, you might want to bring a blanket, lay it on the lawn in front of the Observatory and have a picnic or just lie back and soak up some rays.Hikers: the trails have lots of quirky little sights along the way, but FYI there isn't much shade and that Los Angeles sun beats down hard. Hats, sunglasses and water are de rigueur. Personally I would go early in the morning for cooler temperatures and more solitude, and I would avoid summers completely, but I'm a heat wimp so consider the source. :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spicegrrl
50,Love It,"We went later in the afternoon so parking was no problem and there were hardly any crowds. The hiking was incredible. The trails were well taken care of and relatively easy to navigate. Halfway through our hike, we ran into one of the park council members. He welcomed us to the park and shared some helpful hints and information on what we should look out for. The views of the hollywood sign and city were incredible. We made it down from the mountain just in time to catch a wonderful sunset and watch the city lights turn on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shylamm
40,Pretty sighing,My friends and I drove uphill close to Hollywood sign. We got there around 6pm it was slight haze not clearly see the sign - Hollywood due sunset. Lovely place and pretty sighting over LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Slylittledevil
40,Breath-taking view,Need a parking space near the Park cause the Park is a long climb from where you can park. Overall when you reached the top there was a good view of LA so I think its worth the effort of climbing up and down.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/precie2015
40,Weekdays should be easier... Do visit this gem,"MLK weekend was not a brilliant move as the Griffith was mobbed and parking difficult. That said, a late afternoon visit and early evening vista of LA's lights glowing in all directions is simply wonderful. The exhibits are captivating and informative. The location is superb and, unreal, it is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeanpierred603
50,A terrific view of L.A.,Visit this awesome place if you are in the vicinity of Los Angeles and/or Hollywood. There you will find the Griffith Observatory.

Visit and enjoy nature within the city of angels. You wont regret it. At night time you can see the entire city of Los Angeles and its shiny beauty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cotjos213
30,Great views but too crowded,"We arrived at 9am on a Saturday morning. It was very crowded and hard to find parking.Depending upon where you go in the park, there are wonderful, wide, well-traveled hiking trails (which lead you up to the scenic views), tennis courts, a golf course, a petting zoo and train for little ones, and of course, the observatory.I would want to go back during the week and when I have more energy. It was kind of draining due to all of the crowds.You could spend all day in the park or at little as 45 minutes depending upon what you want to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arualpalm
50,"Best of LA, a must-see","Griffith Park is LA at it's best. The drive up to the park is so scenic. Nearby neighborhoods are ritzy; I've seen a number of filming crews at work in the area. Parking can be hectic. Try to find a spot in the main lot because the alternative is parking on the side of the windy, hilly road. The observatory at the top is free to visit. It's actually quite an engaging and well-maintain museum about space and science. From the observatory's balcony you get one of the best views of the Hollywood sign in all of LA. When it's not too smoggy, you can see for miles across SoCal's urban jungle and the ocean just beyond. If you're a local, bring visitors here. This is the epitome of California. The only downside - you might just make your visitors want to move here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TT_ND
30,"Visit during daylightHistoric park, this is LA's Central Park","It is a huge park. People do get lost.

40,The perfect view,"We came to the Griffith Park just to see the view over Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign - we were not disappointed!It's a good idea to park the car further down the hill, walking up to the park is a good experience in it self and if you got the time, then take a hiking trip to the Hollywood sign.All in all a great trip with beautiful views and nature!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maleneanna
50,Best Secret in LA,"It's free. There are hiking trails, golf courses, the Observatory, and the best view in the city. And, for some reason, Wi-fi. Take a day with a picnic lunch and go up the mountain. It'll be a good change from all the running around, and you can get just as good a pic of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alh45

30,Don't go when its crowded,"Don't go on a busy day. They closed it and we couldn't even get in. We had driven quite a ways and had no idea that we couldn't get to the bird sanctuary. And we were there from out-of-state, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rubbertgator

50,Great experience,"This is a beautiful area with large grounds and wonderful views of the city down below. We got lucky with finding a parking spot near the top, but most people park along the road leading up to the observatory. There was TONS of people even on a weekday in the middle of the day, but it was worth the experience in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bguth11
50,Wow!,"Terrific views;worth seeing both during the day and at night. Did not tour the observatory, but enjoyed walking about on the decks and taking many a photo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckeyeTraveler55

50,Completely unexpected!,"I chose to go this spot as it is always shown on TV. I wanted to see what it was all about. I wasn't real excited as I thought it would be another boring planetarium. Boy, was I wrong. After the long drive through the beautiful park, through the tunnel and up the hill, I found people from every corner of the world. The views were remarkable. The planetarium was VERY interesting with unusual ways to learn! Best views of the city and the Hollywood sign. It was so crowded but really added to the fun. Lots of people taking each others photos, people picknicking, etc. A definate stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anndC1934SE
50,Best views,This place is fantastic since you get to see the whole of LA smog permitting. We didn't have the time to hike or bike through the park so had to drive which was a shame. Will definitely bike through this park later. The grounds of the park are very nice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManiR986
40,Caheunga Peak & Wisdom Tree,"We need we wanted to do a hike but weren't sure where to go. We decided to go straight for the good stuff and took an uber to the Caheunga Peak trail head and started from there. It was no easy hike, mostly uphill on steep rocks and uneven ground. Once we got to the top by the wisdom tree we had some amazing views. Could see Warner Bros studios, snowy mnt peaks and downtown LA. Still not satisfied we continued to hike to Mt. Lee and behind the Hollywood sign then looped back down in front to take some pictures with the sign from the front. Overall it was great until we had to leave. We thought we could just walk back down to the main road but didn't realize how high up we were really were. There is very little cellphone service up in the hill so the second we could order an uber we did. Pretty hard to get into the park without a car unless you're keen on walking up/down hill on roads through people's houses.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristenmerke

50,Amazing!,"We spent a couple of hours here hiking but will definitely be back to hike the trail that starts at the observatory car park to the summit of Mount Hollywood. We took some great photos just before sunset and then at night from the observatory. Make sure you are wearing good walking shoes, bring water and a jacket (if going in winter). It's so, so beautiful here and highly recommended!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandydlozano

40,Pony rides!,We have taken our children there many times. They first started out on the walking ponies then graduated to the trotters. Now we are taking our grandchildren! ! What fun. We have shown then pictures of their mother riding the same(Almost) ponies. Everything is the same. From there they ride the miniature train which is next door. From there to theCarousel. Which is a bit fast but they love it. All of these are right by the entrance off Los Feliz blvd. Unforgettable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/351priscillag

50,Good day hiking spot,"I've hiked a couple of different trails here -- it's a good spot for some exercise that leads to the beautiful observatory and fantastic view of Los Angeles. I believe there are 6 trails? It's an uphill climb, and you should wear appropriate shoes. I saw a girl wearing high-heeled boots and struggling -- that is just silly. This is a good date activity too. After you hike and see the observatory, you can hike back down and eat at Trails.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelingyogi

50,Gorgeous - MUST SEE if you're in L.A.,"It was our first trip to L.A. and we went to a LOT of tourist attractions. The Griffith Park and Observatory were by far the most impressive. I'd definitely return here again. It was clean, beautifully landscaped, safe, and offered some of the best photo opportunities. For hikers, there are a lot of trails that you can take and I'm sure you could spend an entire day here (or more). Skip some of the overrated attractions down in the city and go here instead!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick

40,"Great Hikes, lots of trails","Coming in off Vermont, follow the road into the tunnel and you will find plenty of parking. You start off above the observatory and can take many trails in different directions. There is WiFi in the parking area and you will get good signal on most trails. Trails are wide, safe and well traveled so you wont get lost. With a few exceptions the grade on most trails is not extreme and its dog friendly too.Keep your eyeys open you might even see some famous people on an early morning hike.As you climb, you will get some of the best views of LA and the Hollywood Sign. Some mornings you will be above the cloud line and only see the tops of LA buildings. There is also forests in this area and if you catch sunrise just right can see the sun coming up through the forests. Beautiful sight. Find a map so you can track your time up there and bring some water and comfortable shoes. Dont leave on a hike after 2:30 in the winter as it gets dark fast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OC-RaiderFan
50,"Hiking, Horseback riding, Golf, and Star-gazing all in one place","Griffith Park is where you can escape the city and get back to nature by hiking the many trails or exploring by horseback (Contact Sunset Stables on Beachwood Dr.), and where you can chase a little white ball around, if you're so inclined. But the gem of the park is Griffith Observatory, both for the science and also the panoramic views from the mountains to the sea (also of the Hollywood sign), and a stunning view of downtown L.A. at night. Do NOT visit L.A. without visiting the Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BTuckG

It hosts a number of activities that range from casual exploration, including the old location of the L.A. zoo as well as the new one. It has museums, gold course, lots of rest areas, horse back riding, small shops where you can buy nick nacks and several museums including travel town where you can go back in time to when the main means of transportation were trains. The park can be used for parties, family reunions, or a romantic place to get away and spend some quiet time with your loved one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielR84

50,Spectacular Panoramic Views!,"Griffith Park and the Griffith Observatory have been on my list of things to do in LA. For me the Griffith Observatory and photos are the highlights. Also, discovered this great hiking park with many trails. Winding drive through Griffith Park to the Griffith Observatory at the top was busy with many people and vehicles parked on the shoulder of the road. The drive is worth the spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean by day and LA especially at dusk as the city lights up. Super photo op of the iconic Hollywood Sign from the top of Griffith Park. Also, the height over the city orients visitors to the area and allows a somewhat panoramic view to the east, south and west (hard to see over/through the hills behind the observatory). The sunset photos are among the best I've shot - anywhere! With these photos, I don't need to take my camera again. Actually handed my husband a camera to take photographs and he did! Now, this is one of my new favorite places in the LA area to explore, hike - and photograph!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RikiUSA
50,Terrific views,"My second favorite spot in Los Angeles. Dodger Stadium is the first. I make it a point to get here each time I visit. The views of the city and the Hollywood sign are terrific. This place provides quite a contrast to the urban sprawl of Los Angeles. You can drive all the way to the top and park. I made the mistake of stopping halfway up the first time and walking the rest of the way. You can do this, but it is a really steep uphill walk to get there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/872charlesh
50,Second shot just as nice.,"Did this a couple of years ago and liked it. We hiked, got great shots and just explored. This time it was more just the shots.

50,"bike, hike, run",If you want a pretty much traffic free park to enjoy your favorite outside activities in LA this is it.

50,Griffith Park,Griffith Park is one my favorite spots along the Observatory nearby! Also nice golf courses in the park!,
30,Nice park but terrible traffic/crowds,I know that this is a city park with limited parking... but that is what you get - large crowds and terrible traffic plans. Plan to visit the observatory or see the Hollywood sign from here during the morning or when no shows are at the amphitheater. This park is also on the mountainside which makes it fairly tricky navigating.,
50,Best part of our LA trip!,"This was the most amazing park we have ever been to and probably the best views we have ever seen in LA! We were able to hike up the whole mountain to see the Griffith Observatory and the Hollywood sign. Definitely a tough hike from the one side with the carousel, so be ready and have water on hand because there aren't many stops along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrittSuz

30,Haunted Hayride at Griffith Park,"I went to the Haunted Hayride event that happens every October in Griffith Park. We got the $42 all attractions pass. We got there early and did not have an issue with parking. They take cash only. We did the Haunted Hayride first, it was great, and luckily we did not have to wait long in the line for it. Be sure to wear comfortable clothes since you will be sitting in the hay during the ride. Next we went to the In-Between Dark Maze. In this maze you are let in small groups with one lantern to try to get through the dark maze while being scared by the monsters. Was really freaky. Next we went to the Seven Sins maze, we waited 45 minutes for nothing basically. It was not worth the wait at all, I only liked the ""Lust"" room. The last maze, House of the Four Horsemen, was over an hour wait it was OK, but it was an improvement over the Seven Sins maze. There is the option to pay only $30 for the hayride, but it seems a waste if you are travelling from afar. They also have a VIP (front of the line) pass which costs $58. The area in the middle is called Purgatory, they have psychics, pumpkin carving, an improv theater show (theater macabre) and a merry go round with horse skeletons that goes backwards. Depending on where you live, I would probably recommend doing the Hayride only, however one issue with this place is that you are only allowed to do each attraction once, you cannot go back. I would also recommend not eating the food there, eat before you go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niae274

In another section of the park there are pony rides and a tiny train ride for children that they fix up for Christmas time. On the other end of Griffith Park they have a nice pathway following a stream that leads you to a bird sanctuary. There is also a trail that will lead you up to the observatory where you can take in great views of the city.

50,A walk in the park,"I love Griffith Park! This park feels like home. Its a great place to come any time of year, any time of day. Best views in the city!! The park never gets old - there is always something new to discover here. Enjoy the peace and quiet of the park while in the midst of the city. Beautiful and I highly recommend to everyone, especially visitors to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MasonLAX
50,Must visit if in LA,A must see. Great view. Make the time to visit. Great exhibits along with some very nice people working there. The planetarium shows are worth it as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elduby
40,Worth the visit.,"This place is enormous! I've been here countless times and it seems I always discover a new nook of the park. The trails are great and the views are spectacular, though some take quite a bit of work to get to. This is a wonderful place to get some piece and quiet in the middle of this crazy city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DoubleOIncognito
50,One of the best views in Los Angeles,"Home sweet home, Griffith park is one of the best located view spots in all of LA. You have the whole city and the Hollywood sign. Its a great place to just be :) One of my favorite places to go. I recommend it to everyone, its a must see especially if you are just visiting our city :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Everythinginit
30,Overrated,"In any city that was not park-deprived, this one would not score so highly. Many of the attractions are tacky, gangs are an issue, and there is always danger of fire.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
50,Large,"This park is still filled with wild life whch makes it dangerous, so don't wonder through it alone. You can ride horses through the park from the stables there. You can have picks in a myriad of places.If not careful you can get LOST.I loved it here and I am sure you will too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyaKeittKalule
40,Large park with views,"In a quest to find the Hollywood sign, we followed signs and ended up at the Los Angeles zoo. We got directions from an employee and continued west. It took a while but by following signs we worked through the streets up windy hills to Griffith Observatory where the access and views are. The Observatory was closed this Monday, but being close to the end of the day and sunset, the parking lot was quite full. After all the time and effort to get to this point, we were rewarded with spectacular views on this clear afternoon. To the right up above was the Hollywood sign and to the left down below was Los Angeles and Hollywood. Like the other tourists all around here, we admired the views for a while and took plenty of pictures and videos.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoadtripCowboy
50,See LA,"Great view, day or night, of the LA area. It's closed on Monday, so we didn't get to go into the observatory. It's still worth the drive up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/powycommodore
40,Huge Park!!,"There has to be something for everyone here! We went here to hike, which there are plenty of places for that. We ended up at the zoo. As we drove around the park- we passed birthday parties, picnics, horseback riding and just so many things. If I lived in LA- I would want to live next door to this park and spend most of my free time here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/duane52
50,Wilson & Harding Golf Club restaurant-excellent,We stopped off here before visiting the Observatory and had an excellent breakfast. The restaurant is in the clubhouse overlooking the greens which are beautiful. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OnlyinBrighton
40,Worth the effort !,"This is not the easiest place to get into or out of, we spent some time trying to find our way to the point where you see the HOLLYWOOD sign. Eventually a cycle hire chap pointed us in the right direction which was to get to the observatory.A beautiful place with sweeping, if smoggy, views of the huge city ! The sign is a lot further away than I had expected but still an iconic thing to cast your eye over !Getting back across the main Los Feliz Road on exiting the park was a prolonged experience, avoid visiting around evening rush hour for this very reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Richchap24
40,Beautiful view of LA,"If you've been to LA and have never been to the park before, you should! Very beautiful view of LA. You can drive all the way up so very convenient!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JitM
50,"Go early for a parking space near the observatory, but definitely GO!","This is a fabulous attraction both inside and outside. The views and exhibits are wonderful and many gather there before sunset for that daily event. It is LA, however, so there is a pollution smog/haze much of the time, but it is still well worth driving up to the top of the edge of the city. The park grounds are expansive and beautiful. You don't just walk around this park - it's too big.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lsihrofhhisc
40,Good place to see LA,"It was amazing place where u can see all the la from there. Hollywood sign is very close to you and the best place for that too. Inside is really amazing.

50,Fantastic,"This is a must if you're visiting LA. I would venture to say that even if you do not like hiking, it is worth giving a try. There are some beautiful views! I would recommend be prepared though. Common sense things. Hat, sunscreen, water, water, water. Do your best to know where exactly you are going as well. It can initially be confusing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeW45
50,Great hiking trails,"Incredible views. Great hiking trails especially hiking to the Hollywood sign! Peaceful, meet nice people that give you directions & advice. Take water.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T773UYjoec
50,Just like every other review,Go at least once during the day and once during the night. The views are spectacular.If your going for the sunset I'd suggest going early. Traffic builds up big time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradr879
50,Favourite place in the world,"I can't say there is anything I don't like about Griffith Park it is such a great place. Plenty of hiking trails, Great views from the observatory and great place to view the Hollywood sign. If you decide to hike from the observatory to the Hollywood sign make sure you take plenty of water and plenty of suncream. It is just short of 4 uphill miles to get the sign and then the same to get back but it gets very very hot but the views from the top are nothing short of awesome",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/371andrewf
40,Nice place,We came to the park in the morning of the day we departed so we couldn't wait until the observatory opens (at noon). The park itself is really nice with beautiful views to whole LA and the Hollywood sign.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casatest
50,Pick the right time of day!,"Awesome views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA, although a bit smoggy of course. We wanted to get there around dusk, just in time to see the sunset and experience the city lights at night but weren't able to do it on this trip. Had to go in the afternoon...still had great views though and will plan a night trip next time I'm in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travels4jen
50,Great all-around,"If you're like me and enjoy hiking or are adventurous, then Griffith park is a place you should check out. I haven't done all the hikes as I just moved to SoCal from Canada so I'm unfamiliar. However when I went I found many different trails from small to big that all had it's own unique beauty. I'm curious to find the really good ones. Parking isn't really an issue, just be careful for snakes. Griffith Park is one massive park that is waiting to be explored! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlessandroE2
40,Science with a view,This is a must for those that visit LA surroundings. The park is very nice and the view from the mountain is outstanding.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiosteinberg
40,"Trails, Trails, Trails","Great park to take a stroll, walk, or hike. There was a long line of cars trying to park up at the observatory so we parked down the hill and decided to walk the many trails that lead to it. It was very enjoyable and what a great view and reward when you get to the top.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mioksguy
40,"Gorgeous views, crappy parking",GO EARLY! The parking when we went up there on a Sunday was a nightmare. We had to paralell park down the mountain and hike up to the observatory. The views of LA from the Observatory are great. This is also a great place to get photos of the hollywood sign since the hike has been closed down. It's a beautiful park however. Great hiking trails but very busy...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jennifers587
50,"Oh, what a special place!","Griffith Park just outside the busy city of Los Angeles, was very, very fantastic. Due to a busy schedule that day, we only had one hour, which was of course much too little. But we did grasp the special atmosphere of the Conservatory, and got to see the things we wanted. i would like to spend at least a whole day there! I really hope it will happen...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/britt_sem
50,Great Place to Hike and see Hollywood sign,It was a great hike that took about an hour to get to the top area in front of the sign. Great view and best place to take pictures.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Coachajr
50,As seen in the movies,"Griffith Park is one of my favorite places in Los Angeles and I keep coming back again and again. The weekends are a bit crowded and there can be difficult to find a good parking spot if you want to visit the Observatory made famous from movies like Rebel without a cause with James Dean, and Yes man with Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel. On the weekends it's easier to leave the car and take the Observatory shuttle for $0.50. There are a lot of hiking trails, but watch out for rattlesnakes. If you want to get closer to the Hollywood sign it takes about an hour to hike from the Observatory. It gets really hot so don't forget to bring water. A map over the park is also good. There is also the possibility to visit the sign on horseback. The view from the Observatory looking over Los Angeles is amazing and you don't want to miss the breathtaking sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/36angelicae
30,A dry hike,Average sized park for a good hike. As the rest of LA it's as dry as a hot frying pan. Make sure you visit in off hours or not during summer as every cold-weather-friend person will be sure to melt away.Not much to say in terms of nature and natural sceneries.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/963oliverr

50,Hiking up to Griffiths,"We hiked on a Wednesday morning and easily found free parking on the street by the Trails Cafe. We had already eaten but the cafe was clean and quaint. It was a beautiful hike; you work up a bit of a sweat but the views during the hike and from the top are awesome. It was relatively empty and fun to see two dog walkers each walking eight dogs, and amazing to be higher than the red tailed hawks that are circling below you. Bring a water bottle, wear a hat and use sunscreen, pause to look at the Hollywood sign and enjoy the peace and quiet while you step out of LA and into it's beautiful hills. We were to early to tour the Observatory but the walk was definitely a highlight of our trip to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandb1213

50,Kid's horseback riding at Griffith is awesome!,"My girls looooooooooooove to go to Griffith Park for horseback riding! I try to take them at least once a month, and they ride approximately 4 times each (twice the first time, and then twice again after we grab a bite to eat). Tickets are only $3.00 per ride, and the kids get such a kick out of the ride. They also love the train ride, which is also only $3.00 per person (parents must pay as well). We are there for a couple of hours each time we go - it's really an enjoyable experience for the entire family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skystar2
50,A long time favourite of peace....,"The scenery of LA and Hollywood are amazing. It's free! The Hollywood sign is right there, the picturesque views are stunning of the valley.

30,Struggled to find attractions due to lack of signs,"Using our guidebook, we knew that there were several children friendly activities within the Park: the Zoo, the caves, the miniature railway etc. However, we were unable to find these areas of the Park.Perhaps we missed the road signs or it was because we are unfamiliar with the scale of everything in LA that we were not successful in locating these areas? We did stumble across a funeral!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/potterfan10

50,Lovely oasis in the middle of Hollywood,"We thoroughly enjoyed our picnic in she shade of the trees near the West entrance to the park. Closely were clean bathrooms and a nice playground for the kids. Further up, the park has great views, but we were so enchanted by the peace and quiet in the middle of the city. I am also very impressed with the number of picnic spots throughout the park and the ease of accessibility. Great choice for families!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globeteach

50,Excellent hiking trails and endless exploration,"I've lived adjacent to Griffith Park on either side for about 15 years and I have yet to explore all that it has to offer. From the Hollywood side you can park in several residential neighborhoods with trail heads that will take you up to a great view of the basin, observatory or away from anything resembling LA. From the valley side you have endless trails, the zoo, the Autry, the golf course, travel town and meandering places to find shade with views of all the studio back lots. I've hiked early morning and heard the zoo animals screaming to be fed, and I've jogged the horsetrails at sunset away from heat and traffic. Love Griffith!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leigthm
50,Beautiful Views of the city,"Great place to spend the day, wish we had more time! Parking is free but imagine it could get pretty crowded. The place has different areas to walk around and see views of the city. Part of the building was closed so we were unable to go up to the roof to look out but still amazing views. Wish we had more time to hike some of the trails in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/turtle25
50,Fantastic find and great visit,"After attempting to visit the hollywood sign we saw that the sunset trails were closed. But the park had a member if staff thee to assist and give us information of Griffith park. I wasn't too convicted by this park, but decided to give it a go.Parking was a case of finding a spot and dumping your vehicle, which was straight forward. We decided to go for the trails toward the hollywood sign as we like walking. This trail was a fantastic find and we had an amazing views of LA. And it's glory and then of the hollywood sign. Because of the time you can't getToo close to the sign, if you wanted to get up and close personal with it, I would recommend 4-6 hours during the day. This visit was a great find and really pleased to have come across it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowieEngland
50,Pack an evening picnic!,"A very pleasant place to spend an evening watching the sun fade behind the hills. Be sure to pack a picnic and enjoy it on one of the benches available. Restrooms on-site outdoors as you approach the area after the carpark. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes because it can be quite a long walk from where you park your car if it is as busy as it was when we were there. The main carpark was full so we were directed to parking down the hill, together with many others. A very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The Hollywood sign can be seen in the far distancebut you'll need something better than a smartphone to get a really great photo of it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jc63Stockholm
50,Great views from a little effort,"The route we originally wanted to take was closed by the park so we headed up to near the observatory, parked on the road and headed up the many routes around Griffith park. The paths are dirt tracks, appropriate footwear is required. Great views can be seen of the LA basin and surrounding districts. There were many people on the paths but you can take the slightly more strenuous routes to obtain solitude. Loved walking through the hills and trails and got some great shots of the hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbl0we

50,Hungry and Hiking!,We started out at breakfast on the golf course thanks to a TripAdvisor review! Thank you... the food was great and so was the service. Then we took in a really nice short hike (Fern Dell) half way up to the Observatory. Maybe we'll make it to the top next time. The hike was along a babbling creek with shade... what more could you ask for?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FernShaw

40,Great retreat in the metropolis,"Although there is a severe drought and the park isn't probably at it's finest, Griffith Park is a lovely place to get away from the craziness of L.A. We visited the park on a few occasions and enjoyed the expansive and peaceful atmosphere. The L.A. Zoo is there but we were somewhat disappointed with that aspect. If you'd like a bit of family time to enjoy a picnic and to kick a ball about, head to Griffith Park. It'll make you forget, if only briefly, the hundreds of dollars you're haemorrhaging at the local theme parks and shopping malls.Great hiking opportunities, too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwazycanucks
30,OK,"It is vast. I know that there has been a drought but I felt that this park was lacking flowers. The best kept bit was the golf course, not a place I would go. It had a 1900s carousel in working order but it is in desperate need of restoration. OK for a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TriciaBY
40,Morning Hike,Great morning hike. We got there around 10am and had no problem parking. The beginning of our hike was cool enough but make sure to bring water as it quickly heated up since there was minimal shade. Great views of LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannahsukanykuhl
50,Fantastic views of LA,My partner and I visited the park and did some hiking. It was fantastic and provided great views of the city. Parking was an issue so I'd recommend getting there early. I am certainly going back next time I'm in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Speakerphone

50,Don't miss Griffith Park,"A great place to stretch your legs and enjoy the beautiful view of LA. Perfect for tourist pics. And I still get a kick out of seeing it in the background of so many films and commercials - ""hey, I've been there!""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/400lissaj
50,great Place to spend the day,"As I said in an earlier review, I grew up near the Griffith Park. Used to hike the hills everyday. It still is a great place to spend the day. Many hiking trails, some of them go up the mountain and you can get a beautiful view from the top. Do bring water. It is also a fun place for kids, with plenty to do. Even though we live out of state, when I return to LA I love to visit Griffith Park. On Los Feliz Blvd. you can visit Atwater and by all means go to the Tam O'Shanter for dinner. Been there for years with great prime rib and creamed spinach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marilynjack1929

50,A park with everything,"One can hardly do Griffith Park in one go! There is an excellent zoo on one side which takes a whole day or more and then there is the observatory and planetarium on the other. The planetarium shows are excellent and on the terrace of the observatory, the famous Hollywood sign on the Hollywood hill forms a favorite site for photography. The Greek theatre, the Hollywood bowl are nearby as is a stable where horse riding training is provided. The walk up to the observatory has many trails for trekking though one has to be careful regarding some wild animals like coyotes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZiaChaudhuri

40,Beautiful open space,"My daughter and I visited this park on 4 occasions during our stay in Los Angeles. A beautiful place to be with far reaching open spaces, ideal when you want to get away from the shops and the traffic! Parts of the walking areas we wouldn't want to walk alone as there weren't many people around but if you stick to the path, or with a bike cycle along the path, you do meet other walkers/cyclists along the way. Could have done with some little outlets for refreshments (water!), especially on a sunny day, (perhaps an ice cream parlour?) and a Park Ranger with a little bit more enthusiasm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Evie100
40,"GREAT VIEWS, LOTS TO DO","There's so much to do here from hiking/walking, bird watching, visiting the observatory, or just enjoying the view over LA, which is great by night (the park closes at 10 pm I believe). We went with a couple from the UK who had never been there before and were fascinated by the view and seeing the HOLLYWOOD sign. There is a terrace cafe at the side of the observatory and we had a drink and enjoyed the ambiance. There are various shows at the Observatory and at night you can use the various telescopes. Fee for the shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaWanderer2013
50,Escape the City!,"It is very easy to get to - the winding drive up to the observatory is charming. Beautiful houses, great landscapes. The Greek is one of my favorite venues in LA - it hides the city background and transplants you into a hidden garden amphitheater. The Observatory is a great weekend afternoon trip for visitors and locals alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/720katyp
50,Great For Hiking and Picnics,"I like to drive through Griffith park, and bring a lunch for a picnic along the way. Best of the park is the Observatory. And it's all free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cynsha

40,Difficult to review,"We did not explore the observatory or see what else was here. To be totally honest the main purpose for our trip was Back to the Future sight seeing - and here we got to see the tunnel. We got to drive through the tunnel!! After that, everything else was a bonus.Parking on the day we went was free - not sure if it always is? However, it was also crazy busy so after driving most of the way up the hills and down the other side we finally found a parking lot with some spaces. We set out for a little walk and ended up hiking all the way back up to the tunnel. It was a lovely hike - so peaceful and beautiful. Unfortunately with the parking being so packed and we had other things planned for the rest of the day we did not get to explore the place further.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anthony2k12

40,Excellent break from the city crowds.,"We chilled, hiked and strolled it was so green and lush. Such a nice break from the busy crowds and traffic without a long drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GJAJKJ
30,Needed more planning,"I am sure that if you know Griffith Park it is a wonderful place to go, however as a tourist looking for something mostly free to do on a trip to L.A. we found it very fractured. Attended on a Sunday and the parking for the Observatory was overflowing to the point where we had to park so far away we decided not to walk back with our young children. We then went to find the train and had a little ride for $2 each and onto the Merry Go Round again with a small fee. Even with a map kindly given to us by the train office we couldn't find a play structure for the children and left much earlier than we would have like to. All in all, not the best day of our holiday by far. Definitely needed more planning to workout where everything was before we went, and expect a long walk back to the observatory on a Sunday!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeDee1274
50,Drum Circle,"It is a great day when you can come to Griffith, sit and relax to the beats of the drum circle. I bring and picnic and just sit and listen. The people sitting listening or the ones playing are very nice. Met a lot of very nice people this day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianac302
50,Great views,"Get here earlier in the day when it's not so crowded. Easier parking and great views of LA, the Hollywood sign, etc. It's also beautiful during sunset too! (But definitely much more crowded and not easy to park). No matter what, get tickets to the Centered in the Universe in the Planetarium, it's a great show with a live narrator that gives you perspective of the Earth in the universe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thatpearl
40,very nice hill,"It is full of green which is so rare in LA, in the park road you would see really impressive houses, while you are climbing you will enjoy LA view and will see some cafe&restaurants to rest and at the you will have a great LA panoramic view. It is totally different and worth going at day and also night. Also an observatory building and museum is located at the top if you may interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mustdent

40,A Park with a View,Griffith Park is a medium sized park with a stunning view of all of LA. On a clear day you can even see the ocean from one of the higher points. It is a respite from the surrounding areas of LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyNYLA
40,We hiked for miles.,This semi-wild part of Los Angeles is scenic and lovely. We hiked for several hours and had a great workout. We also saw a whole different side of this large city. Loved it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/332winifreds
40,Perfect for children under ten!,My two years old son could ride on a ponny and a small train goes around the park for less than $10! It's also a pretty big beautiful park near LA zoo. We stopped by before the zoo to let the little one enjoy the nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aoi240
50,Must visit while in Los Angeles,Griffith Park and Griffith Observatory go hand in hand. They are at the same location. Park is magnificent. This is the place to be if you love hiking in the city. We chickened out but the trails looked very enticing.Observatory is all the way to the top of the hill where you get a direct view of the Hollywood sign and great 360 degree view of Los Angeles.This is another must stop while visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhargavipl
50,Batman's Batcave entrance is in this park! Best view for photo of Hollywood Sign!,"I was told that the ""cave"" where the Batman TV show filmed the Batmobile coming out of the Batcave was in Griffith Park so we set out to find it. Yep. It is there; tho it is really a tunnel! Not too far of a walk from the parking lot... but you are walking up a hill to get there.There was a little boy in a Batman costume who came running out of the ""cave"" while we were there--very cute! But there were people of all ages there.We walked through the tunnel. On the other side was an area were we were told many scenes were filmed from Western movies... like when you would see a coyote running on the ridge of a mountain!A man standing next to us asked if we saw the Hollywood Sign from there. We had not. So he showed us that only a few feet from where we were standing we could see the sign close enough to easily take the photo... because this park is in ""Hollywood-land.""A fun FUN side trip for families... couples... hikers... everyone who is able to do a little climb or who wants to be adventurous. Pets are welcome here, too.Go to the bathroom BEFORE you go to the park, tho!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kowalisyn
50,A place not to miss,"This park is something you cannot miss on your visit to LA. I have been here three times and I never tire of it. It is such a beautiful place to visit at sunset. You can see all the valleys around, see LA for miles. As it gets darker, you can see for miles. It is just breathtaking. Don't miss this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brendermac
40,LA Griffith Park,"The park is much more than the great observatory. It is difficult to imagine you are in crowded Los Angeles while in this peaceful setting. You can see the Hollywood sign off in the distance but that is the only reminder of LA. I didn't get to the zoo, but the Brookfield zoo bear Chicago would be tough to beat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GalenaEd
40,Nice free visit,"The park is nice and it is free to get in. It wasnt the best place in the world to see, but for Los Angeles, it is a good spot to check out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jims875
40,"History, Science and Scenery","Although the planetarium is what brought me here the observatory is surrounded by the beautiful park with the Hollywood sign in the distance. It was hard to imagine Rebel Without a Cause was filmed here, the building seems timeless. The views of the city are terrific. For those who love to hike it is a great place and I believe they offer evening group hikes in the park. Pack a picnic lunch and make a day of it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieB105
50,Phenomanol Park,"As a little boy, 40+ years ago, we would go to Griffith Park to play and have picnics. There is a nearby area called Travel Town where we had children's birthday parties. Retired trains and all sorts of neat stuff for the kids for a day trip. There is a large merry-go-round in the park as well as horseback riding for the little kids. Big kids can play golf or go to the top of the mountain to see the Greek Theatre and watch a concert.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasEyedoc2020
40,Great Place for a Hike,"There are lots of great hiking places surrounding LA, but this is the best one actually in the city. You'll need to check the internet for trail maps as its not obvious how to find the trails from the general entrance. Some of the trails are fairly steep but the payoff are some great views. Dog friendly. There is also a public golf course.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/InTheMoment_TBD

50,A top sight in LA,"The Griffith Observatory is in the top tier if sights that this City can be truly proud of. The park is large with lots of trails, the building itself is a historical art-deco beauty and the observatory is interesting. There is plenty if space for a picnic, plenty of free interpretive installations, and the shows I've seen have been good. Weekends/summer/etc gets crowded but what isn't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brilan
30,Nice place for a hike,"You can hike up behind the Hollywood sign which is a bit of an effort, though I did see families with children and prams doing it.Great for if you want a break from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood. The place is a bit barren and really quite hilly and sunny so wear a decent pair of hiking boots and sunscreen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TripMember112420141

50,it's a huge park!,"we visited the park while we were traveling at LA. it's HUGE! i think it's even bigger than the Central Park in New York. We drove around the park and got to the Griffith Observatory and had a nice hike there. There are a lot of hiking trails and picnic tables. I thinking there were camping sites too, not sure. It's a great place for family to hike and play. We enjoyed our visit there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142angelw

40,A short trip worth the drive,"You can see all of LA, including the smog.. I went as apart of a stop on a tour. There's not much, but worth a quick peak. The drive up there is just as interesting as it itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hereandthere123
50,Great place to connect to nature while staying in the city!,"If you enjoy hiking, this is the place to be in LA. There are miles of hiking trails which are very well maintained, many with spectacular views of the city and beyond. It can get warm, as many trails have little to no shade, so start your day early, or later in the afternoon. If you're planning to hike for long, take water with you for yourself and any pet which you may bring along. This is a terrific place to hike with your dog! The length of your hike is entirely up to you, and there are a number of loops that are naturally a perfect length, but be aware that it's very easy to get carried away and discover that you've gone much further than you initially set out to do. While persons of any fitness level can hike it, it helps to be reasonably fit and willing to tackle some of the hills which lead to the best views. Of course, you can elect to not hike at all and still have fun - the carousel and picnic areas are terrific, and the remains of the old zoo are intriguing. In addition to Travel Town, there's a small train which operates in the park for children, and pony rides are available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MjsAjs
40,what a view,"For all the space-curious folks, this is the place to visit. It has some cool gadgets on display. There are a couple of live demonstrations too.For the rest of us, the view is to die for, and the chance to take a photo with the Hollywood sign for background! There is beautiful greenery everywhere and a chance to lie down on the grass for some rest or chow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AshrafB862
40,Big but crowded,"Griffith Park is the largest urban park in the US, even bigger than central park in Manhattan (NY). But unlike Central Park, Griffith Park is not maintained as well by cash strapped LA. If you you're a tourist in town visiting the City of Angels and want to see Griffith Park, it is best to go on a weekday since weekends are crowded and busy. The park offers horse back riding, a train kids can ride on and a train museum, and the LA zoo as well. There are also abundant hiking and walking trails, some of which go all the way up to the Griffith Observatory. There is also a working carousel and Shane's Inspiration park for the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJCrawford
20,Avoid on weekdays,The park is not worth a visit. There is no public transport on weekdays. The walk is long. No map in park office or tourist information.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IndiaWanderlust
50,Fresh air - good spot for photographs,"If you need a balance between the two sides of Hollywood, you need to experience Griffith Park [parking can be difficult but persevere as spaces are continually changing]. If you want to be photographed with the Hollywood sign in the background, this is a must walk. You need to be reasonably fit but you can take your time to get to the highest point. This was a memorable experience for us as we like the outdoors.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LynfaGloucesterUk
50,Amazing way to walk/hike to Griffith Observatory!,"Beautiful and about 17 times the size of ""Central Park"" (of NYC). Tons of hiking trails, super-dooper clean restrooms throughout, and Observatory destination at top of mountain had a great cafe and more restrooms. Hundreds of people within ear-shot, so very safe and fun, friendly cool Park Rangers everywhere too. We also went to the LA Zoo, which was on the other side. We walked from our hotel (Hollywood Stars Inn) on sunset to hike to Observatory and cafe, but zoo is way over miles away on the ""valley side"" of the park and we used rental car to go to their zoo, which btw was one of the best I've ever seen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joeyc302
50,A must-see in the night,"It is simply amazing. The observatory itself is very good for a visit as well yet most people go there for the fantastic view up the hill for LA in the dark.

40,360 degree views of LA,"This is a must stop every time we have visitors in town because:*It has 360 degree views of LA including the Hollywood sign*It's FREETry to go around sunset.

40,Unique to LA,"This is the largest municipal park in the US (I believe) and a real treasure. Although we didn't hike or picnic, we did enjoy the planetarium and the view from the surround.

It is also free to go in unless you want to watch one of the shows at the observatory, go on a horse back riding tour, go to the zoo, etc. Just make sure that you are in a group when wondering around the trails or wooded areas.

And if you're hungry, stop at The Trails Cafe for a treat!From Los Feliz, turn North on Fern Dell Drive. You'll see the entrance to the trail on your left.

No parking up at the park or below along the street. Just ended up passing through rather then trying a second pass. Our fault, we tried late on a Sunday afternoon (around 3:00 p.m.).

This is a great part of Los Angeles and should not be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hejwall
50,Amazing hiking and scenery,"My first time at Griffith Park was for a photoshoot. After shooting in a few different locations within griffith park, I was impressed by how many tranquil spots and hiking trails they had. Not to mention a great spot for a photo session (if you don't mind onlookers watching you while you work).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/496ericas
50,Absolutely Beautiful,"Heading up to the Griffith Observatory you are greeted by a sign that says Griffith Park. The park was extremely well kept and filled with lush foliage. I didn't have an opportunity to set foot on soil since we just drove through, but i was immediately drawn in by the rich smell of jasmine and honeysuckle, which made me think of picniks in the parks. ;)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kristyn24
40,Great observatory but parking is a nightmare on weekends,"Our initial visit on a Sunday morning in January had to be postponed because cars were lined up and down the road for at least half a mile. We went later that night and it was a little better, but not much. The jam isn't because of limited parking; it's because the Observatory is so popular, with perhaps the greatest mountaintop view of downtown L.A. available.The Sunday night we visited, the staff let visitors peer at the craters on the moon through their high powered telescope. The long line moved quickly and everyone had enough time to at least look for two or three minutes.But be forewarned. It is very crowded up there on weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rammer13
50,Go There Every Week,"Been going to Griffith Park for over 20 years now. It is the perfect place for running, walking, biking, and hiking. Oh, yes, lots of picnicking and family friendly atmosphere too. I personally just go there to exercise. It is very motivating to have so many people of all different ages walking and running past you. The horse trails are perfect and kept clean. The restrooms at the playground area are always well kept. I see the cleaning crew out there every morning before 7:30 a.m. If you go late in the day ore evening, it's a different story. By then the masses have been there and unfortunately, there are many people that don't clean after themselves. I prefer early morning exercise and for that, this park is perfect!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aandmrun
40,Great views,"We drove through this well-trodden park to find the Observatory/Planetarium closed. But the views from the top were great - and it is, of course, the best vantage point for the Hollywood sign. Be prepared to queue though to take that iconic photo of the James Dean statue with the Hollywood sign as a backdrop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
50,The Griffith Park visit,New went here with the family and we all loved the everything there was to see. The scenery was so beautiful and the garden was exquisite and beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GENA2010
40,Great urban park,"I go to this park when I have an hour to take a hike into the Hollywood Hills. Great views, peace and quiet, great exercise!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sma0221
50,Get your hike on at Griffith park!,"The trails are wide, easy to hike without huge rocks. The views of Hollywood sign, LA etc are amazing. The hills are humongous if you hail from a flat part of the U.S. so be prepared. Be sure to take water for hydration and a buddy as there are miles and miles of trail and you could be out there for a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeeAnn-SHWM
40,"The Gene Autry Museum and a stunning view of LA, CA","WOW, the Museum was perfection, it was everything you would want to see if you are 60+ and remember fondly all the Western heroes we watched on TV! The Observatory was the first time, on our LA, CA visit, that we saw the view so it was especially exciting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JudiFran
40,Wonderful,"If you have young kids, you should definitely put Griffith Park on your must see list. Great hikes and playgrounds, the merry go round, the zoo, pony rides, the Autry National Center, all add up to lots of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Becky2010
50,Loved every step,"I wish I allowed a whole day just to walk along the trails and absorb the breathtaking views & mountain scenery.Sit yourself down at a bench table and just relax.Visiting in the winter, we were able to find parking quite quickly, though not easily. Allow plenty of time for this, especially if you're travelling in the peak season!This is one of my favourite attractions in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KD128
50,Beautiful,"This park is very beautiful with a best look for Los Angeles. Great place. You can walk to see the nature, you can make a pic mic with your family, you can take a lot of wonderful pictures. I love this place at Los Angeles!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RodrigoJacinto
40,Perfect to take pictures of LA and Hollywood sign,"Go there and you will have a very good time taking pictures of the city and sign, also inside the building it is very good and organized.Also, if you like cars, always there is one of the first Camaros in the parking lot, I do not know if it is there all the time but I went on 2 different dates and was there, also if you go to Google Map it appears there.Go and enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/albertom349

40,Amazing park in the midst of LA,I was surprised by the size and variety of attractions in the park! My almost 3 year old grandson really liked the Traveltown Train area as well as the playground.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwb58
50,Great for Tourist and Views,"This place is great for tourist and great views of the city. When we lived in LA, this was a must stop when we had visitors in town. Its iconic from the movies (Rebel without a Cause) and you have views of Downtown, the Hollywood Sign, and the ocean (if you look closely).For parking, you can NOT drive all the way up, that is reserved for tour buses and handicap spots. Just park anywhere on the drive up and the side of the road, they will NOT ticket you. Also, try to drive up the West side (Western Canyon Road), less cars and tour buses. Look around and you will see a lot of coyotes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/166ToddS
50,Oasis in a concete jungle,"It was lovely seeing the joggers, and the pony stables, and the golf course, etc. far away in space, time, and experience from the LA Freeways. The observatory is a must as well--and the Hollywood sign can be seen, unobstructed from this fabulous institution, one of the top attractions in the whole city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reginalampert
50,Great walks and views,"One of my favourite nature places in LA, there is a wonderful energy to Griffith Park. We have had some fabulous walks and there is a small cafe - Trail Cafe. Which serves hot cups of coffee and tea, homemade pastries and cakes. A great place to kill a couple hours or a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mushie78
50,Beautiful views,"I love going to Griffith Park and going to the observatory. There is so much to see. Main thing if you go is to arrive really early for good parking or have a handicapped parking tag, otherwise you will have to hike to the observatory from your parking spot and they have very steep hills. But once you make it to the entrance it is all well worth it. I recommend seeing one of the shows they are really great. Good family fun and it's all for free (admission and parking) although you will have to pay for the show at the planetarium.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShaniB793
50,Amazing view! Not to miss!,"We didn't go inside the building but the view, oh the view when the sun is going down and once it's down all the lights of the city of Angels is a beautiful image I will cherish in my mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LeilaMauro
50,The best view of the city,"The Griffith Park Observatory is the best location to view the city. We happened to hit a spectacular, sunny, clear day and you can see to the ocean, downtown and the Hollywood hills. The exhibits inside the observatory are tremendous as well with lighted photos from Hubble and other space telescopes as well as planetary telescopes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bounderad
10,Attempt to Visit Failed,We tried to go on a Saturday night at 6pm in late december. There was a 2 mile back up of traffic to get to top of mountain. We could have parked and walked 2 miles but we were not dressed for a hike. We had to turn around and then wait another 45 minutes in the traffic to get back down the mountain.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/draperdavejr
50,An oasis in the ocean of humanity that is LA,"Although Griffith Park is well-traversed by locals and tourists alike, it's a beautiful, large park with plenty of trees and trails that make you feel like you're getting out of the city for a while. Lots of well-used trails take you to some beautiful vistas of the city, as well as to the observatory (which was very crowded when we went).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justmycupoftea
30,Oasis in the middle of LA,This is a great asset to the City of LA. Very relaxing and inviting. We like the neighborhoods around the park and the great Thai restaurants nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadomom2
50,nice area,Relaxing and nice area - easy walking neat to see at night and can walk you dogs. FYI if need bathroom plan aheads,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephStx
30,Very Busy place,The views are nice but the traffic is not worth it. This place is very busy all the time and the parking is bad. there are facilities and you can see the Hollywood sign in the distance but do not park illegally there because they will be on you in a second and the ticket will cost. The road is very narrow going there. If you have time to kill by all means go because the view is good. I would not do this again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonialouish
50,Old Zoo at Griffith Park,"Not being a local, this site was a little hard to find but I heard that it was cool and I went out of my way to find it.This is the location of the old zoo before the LA Zoo was built in it's current location. The move happend some time around 1965 so this place was rather old and warn. This is one of the things that appealed to me.They have built a playground in the general area and when I was there, a kids party was setting up for the afternoon so it's a local favorite.I'm not sure it was intended, but you could climb thru some of the old exhibits and into the cages of animals long removed. The fense had been cut back in some areas to allow limited access to the back of the cages. It would be a bad place to get hurt but a fantastic place to be a snake on the hunt of some unsuspecting humans.Enjoy and take lots of pictures. This would be a great location for a family photo or an interesting (if not dark) wedding proposal.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Media_Monkey_Chris
50,Abundant Beauty Right in the City,"Yes, visit this place. This reminds you of how beautiful the natural world is and that we need to make sure that it is here for future generations. Attractions...Merry Go Round, Pony Rides for the Kids, Golfing, Jogging, Autry Museum...and its all very affordable go here and go often.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelerMargaret
40,The View from Below,"This place is very interesting! My grandsons and I liked the clock best! A very good place to take young, aspiring astronomers! The location is also very nice for taking pictures. Parking was hard to find, though!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSR88550
50,Awesome View,"My boyfriend and I were in LA for the day and heard rave reviews about Griffith Park so we decided to venture up on Monday evening. For whatever reason, the way we went to the park there were numerous signs saying ""Road Closed"" but we kept seeing cars coming down. We decided to just keep driving up to see if we could get up there and to our surprise the entire parking lot was FULL! The Observatory is closed on Mondays however it appeared that everyone had no problem getting to the site to check out the view.The view was awesome and the observatory balconies rock for getting the absolute best view of LA! We got some awesome shots of the downtown area. It is truly amazing to hear crickets whenever you know the city is just a stone throws away. This is definitely somewhere to stop at for a few hours rather than sitting in the awful traffic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/katew83
40,great park,went horseback riding. HUGE park. great during the day and night. Loved the scenery from every view point.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/randigarcia
30,very large park,"Griffith Park is an extremely large Park and hosts a Zoo, an Observatory, hiking trails and many other things. As a tourist I think the main draw is the observatory. The park has its place with a population like Los Angeles has but I think the experience is better to the local population than for the visitor with the exception of the Griffith Observatory",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Continent8
50,A long time favorite of peace.,"The scenery of LA and Hollywood are amazing. It's free! The Hollywood sign is right there, the picturesque views are stunning of the valley.

50,Vast and gorgeous,"Griffith Park is actually quite sprawling for a park in LA. There are several hiking trails, the observatory, The Greek Theater and other attractions to keep everyone entertained. On any given weekend, you will find tons of runners and families taking advantage of the lush grass and open space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iannash85
50,A little bit of Nature right in the city!,"Griffith Park is a beautiful area with many things to do. There's the observatory, which is most definitely worth a visit, but there are also many hiking, biking, picnic, BBQ areas that are very nice. I enjoy the views from the observatory, and I love going hiking in the area or having get-together with friends and BBQ-ing. There's a Merry-Go-Round and a Choo-Choo train and horsie rides for the young ones, and a nice scenic area for adults. I feel relaxed whenever I come here. Oh, and there's a golf course, too! The Greek Theatre, which is my favorite outdoor venue, is also located within Griffith Park. All in all, I find this to be a wonderful place where one can feel like you're outside in nature, even though you're in the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GermaicanSpiceGirl
50,"This is a beautiful park, go and see it!","I can't say enough about the many different and wonderful things that this park has to offer! It seems like there is something special around every corner and in every nook and cranny. There is a tiny train, lot's of big trains, a carousel, pony rides, a big zoo, a western museum, a charming little out door cafe and tons of green and shady areas to sit and picnic or play Frisbee or play with the kids on the swings and slides. It's really a treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daycavtravel
50,Amazing views- watch out for the fog!,We got there just in time to see the sunset as we walked up the hill from our parking spot. Luckily I stopped along the way to take panoramics & regular pics of the hills and forrested areas. By the time we got to the observatory roof the fog had completely moved in! Everything was veiled in clouds. The building and grounds were still beautiful. I can't imagine how great the view would have been of the cityscape. Very happy I dragged my friend there even with the fog.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dierdre77

50,Great views,"10 mins driving distance from downtown Hollywood and once at the top near the Observatory, great views (as long as there isn't too much smog). No fee to get in or park the car and it has a great view of Hollywood and Los Angeles in the distance. Also a good place to get a photo of the Hollywood sign. Would recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jetsettingaussies
50,"Hiking, biking, & the observatory","There is so much to do in Griffith Park and you will see some of the best views of the city from up in these hills.

50,The park that inspired Disneyland,"As a native of L.A. for over 60 years I have yet to visit all of Griffith Park. It offers so much in it's 4200 acres. You have hiking, biking, horseback riding, zoo, theater, and observatory but that's not all. Let me just focus on a small area near Travel town and L.A. live steamers on Zoo dr. as well as a picnic area with a merry-go-round. That place has a bit of history as it was the inspiration for Disneyland. Yes, Walt, who's studio is just across the river used to bring his daughter. Thinking of how it would be nice to expand on this, Disneyland eventually came to be as a result. Disney also participated in the trains, a passion of his. His old barn is on site.Volumes have been written about this park.Plan a day or more here if you can.Check the website provided by Tripadvisor",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hal49
50,Great hikes with amazing views,"We visited the Griffith Observatory on a Saturday afternoon. Although the observatory itself was a little disappointing, on our way out we noticed a number of people hiking up Mt. Hollywood behind the observatory. It looked like a great hike, so we decided to do it. We were not disappointed. It did take about 40 minutes to hike from the Griffith Observatory to the top of Mount Hollywood (there were some more direct trails but we decided to take the less steep trails). We were rewarded with some amazing views. The hike was well worth it, and I highly recommend visiting Griffith park if you are in Los Angeles and have time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/radx4
40,Very nice park,"We explored some of Griffith Park and it is a very nice place to walk and explore. It offers miles and miles of scenic trails, unpaved. There are bathroom facilities that resemble port o potties but are very nice, with running water and soap! We stumbled upon a filming crew cleaning up a set from a recent taping. We also saw some wildlife such as a coyote while in the park. The park also offers a decent view of the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelinFool7215
50,Amazing park so close to Hollywood,We had booked a hiking tour that started at the Greek Theatre and wound our way to Griffith Observatory. The hike was not too hard and we were so impressed with the many different activities to do within the park. Everything from theatre to horse riding! We even saw a coyote not far from where our hike started. Will definitely go back to Griffith Park on our next visit to LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingMum0f2
50,Lovely place to visit in the city,Lovely park to wander in on a sunny day and then to walk up to the observatory and view the skyline of Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Very relaxing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whispycl0ud
50,One of the finest urban parks in the US,"If every city had a Griffith Park, everyone's quality of life would soar. This park has it all, and is a mecca for kids and adults alike.

50,"Beautiful place to see to walk, hike and enjoy!","Walking through the park, and hiking in most of the parts depending on where you are entering it from, is a wonderful and challenging experience, that s rewarded with beautiful sights of the Los Angeles skyline, the Hollywood sign, and much more- all surrounded by nature.At the top of the park, there's also the Griffith Observatory, free of charge, and offering a great learning experience for both kids and adults, along with more beautiful views of the city of angels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/747amartins
50,Hard to beat,"Amazing views, the best stop for the Hollywood sign, and an amazing museum. Best to go in off hours when parking isn't insane, and also check to make sure there aren't Greek Theatre events going on at the same time. I'm not familiar with the trials, but there look to be plenty of great ones. The cafe is also very nice, but may be difficult for picky young eaters.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AustinEEE
50,don't miss the observatory!,"Do not miss the Observatory!Went there ona Sunday and we wanted to get to the observatory by the end of the afternoon to watch the sunset and LA lighting up, but apparently the whole city had the same idea and we had to park waaaay too far from the observatory and walk up the hill. The effort was worthy, though. Really beautiful.If you're going there to enjoy the sunset, I advise you to pick a week day or to get there a lot earlier during the weekends to avoid the traffic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/analuiza88

50,WILSON HARDING GOLF COURSE CLUB HOUSE RESTAURANT,This restaurant in the middle of Griffith Park is a true gem. I go there most weekends for breakfast and watch the golfers come up the 18th green at Harding. Most mornings there are deer in the middle of the fairway. The food and ambiance of a 1930's vintage conservation corps built building can't be beat. The prices for breakfast are half what you pay a few miles away on Riverside Drive.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmuk51

40,Great place to hike in the early morning,"Avoid the crowd and go early. It is a great place to hike through to see LA from a birds eye's point of view. Take water with you as there are few ""pit stops"" along the way, and you will need it if you are doing a long walk. Great for friends, family or solo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jetzetter

40,Fanstastic Views,Can get crowded. Beautiful huge park with so much to see and do. Amazing views of LA. You can drive through or spend the day there.,
50,Adventure in the City!,"We were staying in Hollywood for a conference and ventured out to hike at Griffith Park. While it takes quite a bit of research, you can easily get to this park via public transportation. (the city should make this information much easier to access). It is a short walk from the Hollywood/Western Metro station through the Fern Dell Gardens to the Trails Cafe. Or on the weekends there is a Metro Observatory Shuttle that picks up at the Sunset/Vermont Metro station and drops off right at the Observatory.If you want to hike take water, it is a must. There are many picnic tables throughout the park.We visited here twice. The first day, we ate at the Trails Cafe, toured the Observatory and hiked. The Trails Cafe is a wonderful place for lunch or a snack. It is right at the foot of the West Observatory trail. The Observatory is very cool to visit. Clean restrooms and also offers a cafe with a decent menu.The second day we hiked to Dante's View on Mt Hollywood and then on to Mt. Lee and up behind the Hollywood sign. It was a 6 mile round trip hike. To do this takes some research, but it was a very enjoyable and rewarding hike. The views and the landscape are incredible.The park service should improve visitor information and trail guidance. Trails are not marked. We consulted with a local hiking blogger, Dan's Hiking Pages, to figure out how to hike to the Hollywood sign from the Observatory.From the hike you can see amazing views of downtown LA, Lake Hollywood, The Hollywood sign and the San Gabriel Mountains. There are many hiking choices and if we would have had time we would have tried other trails. If you like horses, there are a couple of places that offer horseback riding on these trails that looked very fun.Hiking at Griffith Park was the highlight of our visit to the LA area. We had a great time.",
40,Great views!,There are great views from Griffith Park. We toured the observatory and saw a show at the Planetarium. Would be great for kids. Lots of interactive displays.,
40,Romantic Overlook of LA,"It was difficult trying to find our way up to the top of the observatory, but well worth the night view. Make sure to do your research before heading to the top because the signs do a poor job of directing us up. Once up, I hope your parallel parking skills are up to par because some for a San Diegan, those hills were pretty tricky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trades32

50,Amazing park and home of the Griffith Observatory,"The park has some of the best views of the LA skyline and the Hollywood sign. Lots of trails for hiking and biking and is ofter referred to as the Central Park of LA. The main hill leading up to the observatory was where part of the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause"" was filmed and there is a statue of James Dean in the park. The tunnel is where scenes for the movie ""Back to the Future were filmed. Lots of other movies and tv shows film at the park too.

50,Best place to run in LA,"If you like hiking or running with a gorgeous secluded view, this is the place for you! I lived in NYC for awhile and this is like 10,000 times larger than Central Park.

50,On the trail to Mt. Hollywood,"Journey started in the parking lot not far from the merry-go-round. Parking is free and close to park restrooms. Start early and bring plenty of water as the hills are exposed. Dogs allowed on leash and a drinking fountain can be found on trail for hikers and four-legged pals!On this particular August day, skies were very overcast so nice for the uphill trek. Once at the top of Mt. Hollywood, clouds started to break and enjoyed decent views of the Observatory and the famous Hollywood sign. Survey monument showed elevation at 1619 ft. so a good number of steps to the top! With rest and snack stops, hike took 3.75 hours r/t.Tip: Best to go with someone who knows the trails as many are unmarked. Case in point, three hikers rescued by helicopter the next day when they brushed w/poison oak and lost their way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shimadog

50,Griffith Park and Observatory,"This is always a great place to visit. It's amazing that there is such a large natural area in the heart of a city as large as LA. The surroundings are beautiful, there are plenty of places to stop for a picnic and several walking trails. Parking is free...a rarity in LA. We happened to catch the filming of a hockey commercial or movie scene while driving through. It was surreal to see the trees covered with ""snow"" in the middle of summer! The Observatory is also free with some presentations provided at a nominal fee. The view is priceless! I would suggest going late afternoon to early evening to see the sun set. They set up telescopes outside at nightfall for free viewing of whatever heavenly body is most visible. We've seen the moon (it's cooler when you can actually see the craters!), Saturn and Jupiter with its moons. The workers are all very informational, friendly and eager to share their knowledge. Be sure to go into the lower level of the Observatory and check out the weight differences on the planets and the seismograph (you can jump to create your own ""earthquake""!). We were fortunate to encounter one particularly interesting worker. He was so enthusiastic and had a large following wherever he went to speak in the room. Cars will be parked up and down the long winding road to the Observatory. Take a chance and drive up to the small parking lot. People are always leaving. If you're patient, you can snag a spot and not have to walk forever! We've never parked along the road although sometimes it takes 10 or 15 minutes to get a spot in the lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/blabink

40,What you make of it,"Griffith Park is huge. So there is a little bit for everyone.There are a couple of different ways to access the park (off Los Feliz, the 5fwy and 134 fwy). I highly recommend avoiding the zoo park entrance unless you are going to the Los Angeles Zoo (it is packed and on the other side of most activities).If you have small kids, go in through the Los Feliz entrance to find travel town (there are pony rides, a train, and a wagon ride).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCJules

50,Free attraction-well worth a visit.,"This gem is only about 3.5 miles from the heart of downtown LA but easy to find by car, or presumably cheap enough by taxi. I don't think any tour buses from downtown LA visit here but if you can, make the effort to get there. The views of the Hollywood sign and LA skyline are outstanding.The observatory itself is an impressive building with lots of interesting exhibits: more for children aged 8+ and adults I would say. There are regular shows in the planetarium ($7 for adults) but we didn't have time to see any unfortunately.Definitely a place to spend an afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mseren93
50,luscious green in Los Angeles,"When I lived in London, I always loved visiting the parks. If you are close to Los Feliz, you have this beauty in the backyard.

We wanted to photograph the views, which were amazing.Unfortunately, the car parks were full and the overflow parking snaked for miles around the twisty hills, making driving and looking for a parking space very stressful.Eventually, we did find somewhere to park, but it was miles away from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravelling

50,"Love, love, love Griffith Park","Used to live nearby and went hiking about five days a week. There are countless miles of trails, but I tended to stick to the same trail most of the time: all the way to the top! The views you get from the top (above the Observatory) are spectacular. You can also hike to the Hollywood sign, which is fun. Bring water and wear sunscreen, since there's not much shade offered!The rest of the park is great as well, even if you don't do any of the hiking, b/c it's just so huge. I've seen people celebrating birthdays, playing frisbee, walking their pet pigs (it is L.A. after all), having picnics, doing yoga, filming, pretty much anything...

50,Something for almost everyone,"If someone is on a budget, there are a number of attractions within Griffith Park for seniors down to young children. From north to south, there is Travel Town--the train museum. There is The Autry National Museum, and the The Los Angeles Zoo in the North East part of the park. The Autry has permanent exhibits of the Cowboy lifestyle, much of which was donated by Gene Autry. There are also permanent exhibits of Mexican Charros an Native Americans. There are 2 or 3 rotated exhibits at any given time as well. There are restaurants in both the Zoo and the Autry.In the middle there are a number of hiking trails and golf courses. Approximately midway on Crystal Springs, on one side of the street is the Ranger Station in the Los Feliz Adobe, where you can get detailed information on both the attractions above, and those that follow. On the other side of the street is one of the few genuine Merry-Go-Rounds left in Southern California. There is a charge, but it is nominal. Going south on Crystal Springs, you will find a pony ride and horse rental, as well as a miniature train that takes a tour of the park.In the Southwest part of the park are Fern Dell and the Observatory. Fern Dell is more of a walk than a hike. It is planted with dozens of species of ferns.There is a brook that runs through the middle. over which are a number of picturesque foot bridges. It is a great place for a family to spend time. Many local artists go there to to take photos, sketch, and paint. There is a picnic area close by. The observatory is in the Southwest part of the park as well.More detailed information, a map, and current prices of all attractions can be obtained on the Park Website.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/932BrendaG
40,A Wilderness in the City,"I decided to take a walk this morning but I didn't want to do the ""old walk around the neighborhood"" thing. So, I took a short drive over to Griffith Park. I forgot what a ""neat"" place it is. All in one park - the Griffith Observatory, the LA Zoo, 3 golf courses, and the Greek Theater, just to mention a few. There are bike paths, hiking trails, the Pony Rides (my folks took me there when I was a kid), and a great Merry-Go-Round. I walked near the Greet Theater, which is sort of an uphill-downhill area. Invigorating!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RobertL873
50,One of the must-dos in LA,Probably one of the more popular trails in LA. You are able to get great views of LA city as well as get closeup to the famous Hollywood sign.

50,Perfect for a stroll or a picnic in the quiet,"Perfect place away from the traffic. The park is quite large, and chances are it won't be too crowded. There are hikes and places where you can have picnic. In some areas of the park you can still see the remains of the old zoo, which makes it a great place for random fun pictures with friends. Beware of wild animals after dark, it's still a park and there is wildlife living there (bobcats and coyotes), it's unlikely that anything would attack a human but your small pets might not be as safe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/f64CM
50,We love Griffith Park!,"There is so much to do here. Usually we l hike, there are trails for all levels. (Sometimes we go with the Sierra Club) We love the zoo.

40,Do your home work,"There are so many aspects to the park you really need to do some research first. Especially if you are from out of town. There doesn't seem to be a single source of ALL information about the zoo, the travel museum, the model trains, the horse riding and kids pony's and the carousel; so dig around. You can easily take a family here 3 times in a week and see completely different things each time. Then add on the exploring, hiking and picnics. Some attractions can get busy so go early. Zoo is unbearably hot at the height of the summer so duck into the Gene Autry Museum as a cool off. Its all good and a great alternative to the screaming and lousy food at the theme parks or the buzz of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504
50,An iconic LA gem for adults and kids,You cannot beat the setting and the building has so much history.

Let your dogs run and play, but remember big, wild cats still live up there, ride horses, hit up the zoo or museum, or just be in the mountains right here in LA. I try to hike there everyday, I live 5 mins away from Griffith and the observatory which is all free, and free parking, great views from the top:)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sundaradawn
50,Great Hiking in the Center of L.A.,"Looking to get in a hike while in Southern California? Remarkably, you can find great ones right in the heart of Los Angeles in the famous Griffith Park, known primarily for the famous HOLLYWOOD sign and observatory seen in many films. The hikes take you up and down rigorous hills and mountains. Some paths are more popular than others, and some obviously more difficult. We began ours to Mt. Hollywood, a more moderate/popular hike, as it begins in the observatory parking lot and then goes up. It was a terrific hike, giving us a great workout and fabulous view of LA and the HOLLYWOOD sign!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatSnyder
50,Griffith Park!!!! Yay!,"I can not say enough about Griffith Park. One of my favorite places in LA. It is great for everyone, including canines!!!!!! There are so many incredible places to go to within the park. The Old Zoo is great lots of old cages that you can go exploring and if you have kids they will love it, lots of hiking trails too! Fern Dell is an a dream on any day! So peaceful and relaxing with benches all up and down the trail. You can also hike up to the observatory from here, mind you that the trail does get steep once you start nearing the top. Don't forget about travel town when you visit! Lots of old locomotives, very cool for kids specially if they love trains or are going through the Thomas phase, parents you know what I am talking about! Make sure to bring comfortable shoes as I have seen women going up the trails in high heels! Yes high heels! All three areas that I mentioned have restrooms and drinking fountains. Plan to spend 2-3 hours or make it a picnic and spend the day! Bring sweaters as it does tend to get cooler as soon as the sun starts going down. Griffith Park is an amazing, fun place to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luvLA85

40,Pony and train rides for the kids were great!,"Beautiful park even though the pony area was a bit stinky. They should clean up after the ponies right away to maybe lessen the smell. Beware of the bathrooms. Very dirty. Great deal on the pony rides ($3 for 2 laps). They have different levels (slow, medium, and fast) for different ages and heights. Watch out though because our girls only got one lap around. We were confused at first but when we inquired, found out it was supposed to be 2 laps. We were offered another ride but there was a line and we didn't want to wait. They did give us a card for a free ride for next time though. We went on a Friday and though it wasn't too crowded, there were a lot of people. We waited about 20 minutes for the medium ride. The other rides didn't have too many people waiting for it. Can't speak for a Saturday though. I did notice a snack bar which sold ice cream, drinks, and I think it had some food. Was feeling a little under the weather so I didn't check it out. Maybe next time. Definitely go and take the kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VangFamily

40,Nice 9 hole golf course,If you know an LA resident with a park golf pass this is a nice 9 hole course that you have to walk. They rent pull carts--play can be slow but the course is challenging enough but also very playable for beginners too.

40,On a clear day you can appreciate the view,"We attended the Planetarium presentation which I enjoyed. Other than the view and a walk through the observatory, there is not much else to do, so plan to include it. The air conditioned theater is pleasant if you visit on a hot day.For photo buffs on vacation, you are presented with spectacular views of Los Angeles, the iconic Hollywood sign, and surrounding suburbs. You can see all the way to the coast if the air quality allows for it - not a given.Midweek visits will help to avoid some of the crowds. Parking is always an issue, and you may have to walk some distance on busy days. Still, it is worth the drive, and an easy tie-in with a trip to the Los Angeles Zoo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/globalexplorer1

50,Long trek up...but worth it!,My only regret in our visit is that we didn't allow enough time. The views from here are spectacular...as long as you understand the effect of the smog (it is highly unlikely you will get a completely clear view).Take the time to at least walk in and view the rotunda and the free exhibits...educational and engaging.I found the solstice and equinox markers quite interesting as it was very near the solstice when we visited.Would have loved to do some hiking as the park has many beautiful trails.Bottom line...plan to spend a couple hours (or a whole day) and enjoy this excellent urban oasis.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlumniGuy

Great for families, individuals, dogs .., everyone can enjoy the Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTTABEST
50,Place to go for hiking in LA.,"There are granite quarry caves that were featured in many movies and tv shows until the 70s that you can visit. Everytime you saw a cave you cold be sure it was filmed at Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. Even the Bat Cave on Batman used the Bronson Caves for the Batman tv shows. I visited recently, and for filming they have to be careful not to show the Hollywood sign. Then the path will take you steeply upwards to the Hollywood sign itself. Be careful, it's about a 2-mile vigorous steep hike to reach the top - just over the Hollywood sign. If you aren't in shape don't even attempt it. For those you can go on a less vigorous hike from the parking area of the observatory to the Hollywood sign. To get to the caves and the steep path up the mountain, take Bronson Ave as far North as it goes - go left at the end and that road lead you right to the parking area. Walk up the path and the main path to the Hollywood sign is right is straight ahead while if you take the first right up a slope you'll shortly find the caves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/knightline
50,Awesome View of HOLLYWOOD Sign near the Observatory.,Great pictures of the famous Hollywood Sign and the hills. The walk is a little steep so wear your walking shoes. We spent 30 minutes taking pictures and then visited the Hollywood Walk of Fame.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jtopel
40,Outstanding free observatory!,"Although this place can get very crowded and parking can be an issue, the observatory is a beautiful structure that overlooks hazy L.A. with the famed Hollywood sign in the distance. Entrance is free but some of the exhibits charge a modest fee. The onsite cafe is quite good but does not have real cream for the coffee (for shame!). Worth the trip!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laminicooperman
40,One of the Must See in LA!,"I just love the view from this place. Breath taking!!It almost goes well with anyone you go with! As couple, with friends, family, or with kids, anyone from any age can enjoy the Griffith Park.Only one thing I hate is the getting here/leaving here. . . It's in LA...and when you visit here on a weekend or holiday, etc... police will actually shut some of the road...so you will need to know how to get to Griffith Park, or Leave the Griffith Park and get on the FWY.I'll not be able to reach here without my car-navi...lolI would suggest to arrive here bit early, because on a peak days...parkinglot will be full, and will have no choice but to park on the streets. . . .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HYX-Curious-Journey
40,an oasis in the city,"and an oasis with fabulous views of the city! More than just the observatory for which it's known, Griffith Park is full of fun ways to explore the city. The one with the best view, I felt, was the Mt. Hollywood trail, which great views of the sign, and downtown LA. Sturdy shoes are advised, and take care of rattle snakes.Greek Theatre near the park's entrance has a wide range of performers throughout the season. Not easy to park near the Observatory so prepare to park on the hill and walk up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cariannec
50,Always Fun,"My son and I love going to Griffith Park, there is so much to do there. You can show up in gym clothes and run, jog, or hike. Or you can go to the observatory, or just spend the day in the park. If you've never been you really should go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeastMode36
50,Beautiful Park,"It's easy to see why they say LA is the land of the beautiful when they have free outdoor facilities like this. A beautifully kept park for all kinds of outdoor pastimes (walking, running, hiking, horse riding) not to mention housing the LA Zoo. A lovely serene place in the midst of LA - you feel a million miles from the city. Well worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J_JMcMillan
50,"Great views, lovely spot to escape hustle and bustle","Did Mulholland Drive then Griffith Park and loved both. Architecture of the Building worth a walk around and the views are spectacular. Lots of people and dogs hiking around the trails and tons of blooming trees...a great spring destination for a picnic or hike not to mention the observatory.If the traffic gets to you, head for the hills of Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairann2000
50,Hike with incredible views,Griffith Park is home to miles and miles of hiking trails up in the mountains overlooking LA. I was only able to take one (the trail from the Observatory) but I'm told each one is spectacular. The trail I took was pretty easy and not that strenuous. Can be done easily in about 30 minutes. The view of the Hollywood sign makes for a great photo opportunity.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KasleBounce
40,Best view of the expanse of LA - and the Hollywood sign,"The grounds and Grffith Park building are beautiful. Amazing views of the spread of LA - depending on the smog! You can get a great photo here of the Holllywood sign. If you have children, plan to spend time at the GP building. It has amazing planetarium, observatory and heaps of cool information and interactive things for them to learn about the galaxy, the moon phases, seasons... and its completely free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmandaW257
50,Interesting,"We only spent a very short time at Griffith Park, but it was well worth the time spent. We would recommend you allow at least a couple of hours to visit in order to do it justice. This is one stop we would like to revisit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAVBV
50,Fantastic views and a must do,"Whether you are visiting or live in LA this is a favorite. Trails, views and something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plastx2
50,A Visit to Griffith Observatory,"First of all, I love the Art Deco architecture of the building. The Astronomers Monument stands in front, with names like Galileo and Newton. Inside, the science exhibits are fascinating and many are simple enough for children to understand. The Observatory first opened in 1935. It closed in 2002 for a major expansion and re-opened in late fall of 2006. It has been seen in many movies, including 1955 ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and there is a sculpture of James Dean. The views over the Los Angeles basin range from downtown to Hollywood and all the way to the ocean. You can also see Mt. Hollywood. It's definitely a worthwhile visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
40,fun for young and old,Many nice exhibits. This is a fun place to visit and has very interesting displays. Go at night and see the city lights.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArnoldV844
50,Check out the Walt Disney Train Museum,On the far North East side of the park is located Walt Disney's Red Barn railroad Museum. It is part of the Southern California Model Railroad Museum. The Third Sunday of each Month entrance is free for the public. Take a ride or look at some of Walt's orginial Railroad that he had in his backyard. This was where he got the idea for the Disneyland Railroad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bhd

50,An Oasis in the City,"Griffith Park has a lot to offer: great observatory, zoo, Autry Museum, Travel Town, golf course, bike rentals, a variety of picnic areas, hiking trails for all levels, and more. The terrain includes canyons, a fern dell, shady paths. I live very near and often visit some area of the park. I highly recommend for visitors and locals alike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Koda
40,Griffith Park Merry Go Round,"Griffith Park is an expansive park just north of downtown Los Angeles. A nice little secret is the Old-Fashioned Merry Go-Round. It is a work of art and cost $2 per ride, which last approximately 4 minutes. It truly is one of those things ""you've been meaning to do.....but couldn't find the time."" An added feature is there is plenty of grass and shade trees for those who want to really relax and throw in a picnic.One final note, there is plenty of FREE parking adjacent the attraction. Even though the park is large, signage is pretty good. We used the smartphone GPS and were directed to the spot with no issues.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fredyt3
50,You can take pictures of the MOST beautiful Cityview of LA,"Yep... GRiffith!!! The place you MUST go when you travel in LA. If you are the photo lover or love to take some of beautiful picture for your trip, then you must go to Griffith. Griffith is free admission, and free public parking is available on hill. i went there for sunset on that day like around 4pm, but already too many cars parked outside of the entrance. Since people there for the sunset, its hard to find a spot for parking. i drove down to the hill a bit farther, there have many parking spots are available. But have to walk about 10-15 minutes back up to the Griffith Observatory. Its okay. while you are walking, you still can see the beautiful sunset on your right hand side, and the Hollywood Sign just right next to the Sun, you might want to stay there to take some good pictures! ;) Plus, there have public restrooms for men and women or family, water fountains and chairs also available on the side walk of Parking lot. You always can stop to get rest. I spent about 3 hours there to take pictures, also enjoying some relaxing time with my family there. Even during the dusk/evening, there still have many people there to chilling around, still don't want to leave. This is the place that i strongly recommended it to everyone, and i definitely will return there next time when i visit LA again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JJnish
50,4000 Acres of Nature in LA,"Not many people realize that they have this free, great resource in LA. And there is more to it than just the great views from the Observatory. There are many miles of hiking trails, where you can forget that you are in the middle of a huge metropolis (until you get to the top of a ridge). A hike to the top of Mount Hollywood gives 360 degree views of the city, and is worth the effort getting there.However, there is much more to the park. Travel Town Rail Museum houses vintage and antique trains, in addition to having a small scale raildroad circling the area. Next door, the LA Live Steamers takes Walt Disney's love of trains to the public. In addition to the ""Carolwood Barn"", where Walt worked on his trains, there is an extensive layout of model trains large enough to ride in. The LA Zoo is also in Griffith Park, along with the Gene Autry Musuem of Western Heritage. The Merry Go Round is still located near the ranger station, and is credited with giving Walt Disney the idea for a theme park. There are play areas, BBQ pits, and even a pony ride area (with yet ANOTHER miniature train). And the trails! Miles and miles of trails!Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DizKahuna
40,Nice spot near Hollywood,Nice place to get away from it all when you are tired of the Hollywood hype. Scenic views and much land to hike around. Check it out next time you are in L.A.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geneg855

50,Beautiful Park!,What a great park for Los Angeles. This park was much bigger than I expected! I took the kids up to the observatory and we did a little hiking. It was pretty hot but that was a nice break from the weather back home.

40,Lovely views,Lovely views over Los Angeles but I wish we had allowed more time to walk. Views of the Hollywood sign were good but not much better than seeing it from the Hollywood bowl which is a lot more central. Parking was difficult and we had a long walk up to the Observatory but I'm not complaining as it was very enjoyable and all free of charge,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheDuchessNottingham
50,Amazingly peaceful hike,"I was surprised just how long this hike was up to the iconic Hollywood sign. The trail is paved in spots and while not difficult, it was much farther than I expected to reach the sign. Be prepared by wearing comfortable shoes and bringing a water bottle. I walked it on a Friday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. Easily 75% of the people I encountered were locals out exercising. Once you are up to the sign a tall chain fence makes pictures a little difficult but still worth the climb. A friend who lives locally told me that the sign is protected by numerous cameras that assure no one gets any ideas to jump the fence and get too close. On the advice of locals, I took N Beachwood Dr up to some limited parking and happened to find a spot without a problem. It's not well marked and I think the locals like it that way. :o)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrandonW957
50,"Serene, beautiful, a must.","I love this scenic park. It is massive. You will want to stop at the Observatory. Once there, you may have trouble parking, but is so worth seeing. Some displays you will also have to wait your turn for. But the learning lessons are bountiful. From adults to kids, this park and Observatory are for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374dw

50,Train Town,Awesome for kids and it's FREE...what a great way to spend an hour or two! We stopped over here before heading home and could not have made a better choice. The kids just loved jumping on and off the old train cars and we got to go on a little train ride ($2.50 per person=bargain!). There's also a museum and gift shop on the premises. What a fantastic memory to leave the kids with as we ended our stay in LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoodLife15
50,One of the best things about L.A.,"We drove to the observatory and enjoyed a great view of the Hollywood sign. The observatory itself is beautiful. There are several individual bathrooms (dirty) in a building near the parking lot, but lines form especially when tour groups arrive. The hiking trails were amazing. I wish I lived next to this park. We also went to Travel Town. This is a great outdoor museum with several very old trains. There is also a large shed that houses some very old cars and trucks. This area is a great place for a picnic. Bathrooms are hard to find, but very clean here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MangoSmooth
50,Excellent View,Fantastic view of the Hollywood Sign and LA. Plan at least an hour or more. Great exhibits on space etc. A must do when visiting LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pearx4
50,Must visit when in LA,"Beautiful drive up ""the hill"". Can stop anywhere along the way to hike the paths. Go early in the day and the view is wonderful from the observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KLBWylie_TX
50,What a nice surprise!,"A on cool and pleasant day in March, we explored the old abandoned zoo and the trails above it. Great views! I had seen Griffith Park from the highways and always thought it looked kind of barren, but it was lovely at this time of year. We stuck to the easy-to-walk park-condoned trails, but my sons pointed out the many maverick paths that can be used to scramble up and down the hillsides if you're a scramble the hillsides kind of person. There were many interesting-looking routes branching off from the path we took that I would love to go back and explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSniggins
50,Brilliant Views,"Griffith Park is unusual in the fact it is located in the centre of Los Angeles. To find some of the best views of the city, you need to follow the signs up to the observatory. There is a relatively large car park here but it does get busy so you may have to park on the road and walk up the rest of way. For those just wanting to have great views of the city, you can stay on the level of the observatory which has viewing platform over the city and a large grassed area at the front if you want to take the family and have a picnic. There are restrooms here and water fountains for those wishing to use the facilities. The views of the city from this level are great but Los Angeles is well known forits haze. If you want to see any great distance, it is best to go to the park later on in the day so the sun has a chance to burn through. For the more adventurous, there is a pathway which leads from the car park which takes you up to one of the higher peaks. It is a little steep in places but perfectly accessible and the path quite wide. From this path you get a great view of the ""Hollywood"" sign. Once you have reached the top which is accessed via the zig zag path, the view is stunning. There is a viewing platform which allows you to see for miles around. This park is certainly worth a visit, but dont forget the camera!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donk1
40,Excellent hiking if you can find it,"I spent about 2 hours in the park and was at first unimpressed. There was a lot of construction and none of the parking lots boasted trail heads in their signage so I picked one as far in as possible, but even so I had to walk about a mile on a trail RIGHT next to the road until I found one branching off into the hills. I walked about 3 miles out and then turned and because in all that time, I never saw a sign indicating which trail I was on. I was fairly certain I had come back to the main road and was not far from my start point, but with no trail signs, it was impossible to be sure. If only they would do a better job labeling trails, this place would be prefect",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElizabethANRodriguez
50,nice place to take the family,i know it is out of the management control but there were so many school kids running around and very noisy. Try to go when the kids are in school. do not go when there is a school holiday either. we did not find parking had to walk up the hill bring the rigth shoes to walk in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vicm726
50,Beautifull place to Hike,"I been here 2 times & it has surprised me both times, there are lots of hiking trails & biking trails.There is a Beautifull view of Los angeles skyline at the top of the mountain, worth the hike.I recomend to bring your own water because there are not vending machines once you go on the trails.It coud get hot",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yael47

On our last trip both kids (4 and 2) rode the ponies in addition to the train. We got some great photos of very happy kids.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AllegraS_12
50,No trip to Hollywood is complete without it,"Go during the day for great views of the Hollywood sign (which is rarely lit up at night unless someone pays for it for an event). You can hike along a trail to get right up to the fence around the sign and it's a really nice walk. The observatory itself is nice to walk around and see the views of LA day or night. If traffic is bad, it's hard to get up there, especially if there's a concert or event going on.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Broctoon
50,"Beautiful Views, Lots of Fun Spots",What a beautiful park. Many magnificent views. Wonderful hiking trails. Numerous scenic photo opportunities. Griffith Observatory is in the park as is a zoo and golf course. I'd love to come back early and hike up to the highest peak one day. And I could spend more time taking pictures and taking in all the wonders of the Observatory. This is a must stop in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtomicReviewer
50,The view is magnificent!,Don't visit LA without visiting the top of the park where the observatory is.

50,Beautiful View,"When we were walking up from where we parked our car, I felt like I was in Northern California with the beautiful trees and the dusty air. The views are gorgeous. Gotta love the diversity in California. The lawn of the Griffith Observatory is beautifully maintained; the grass was picture-perfect. The views were gorgeous; it's like you're in the middle of nowhere. There are eastern views of the hollywood sign (it is to the west). There is a restaurant in the complext, but we didn't eat there. On a clear day (which unfortunately it was NOT), you could see for miles. Even in the smog, views of downtown LA were visible. The best part is that we didn't have to pay a dime for the views. Definitely a tourist hub however.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCirillo

On a clear day you can see down to Santa Monica and then down to Palos Verdes.The Observatory is a fun and interactive experience for ""kids of all ages"". From the novice to the astrophysicist there is something for everyone. Hang around and early for the Tesla Coil exhibit.Most of us in Los Angeles like to drive to the supermarket and park right next to the handicap parking. So, keep that in mind when reading some of the reviews here. Parking can be a challenge if you arrive late in the morning. No fear, there is parking along the roads and if you are European you will feel right at home. Park anywhere you can (with limits of course and safety).Besides what is inside the observatory there are plenty of hikes and trails to do. Bring water and snacks and a backpack. You will have fun!Then of course there is the draw of the Hollywood sign and that this Park has been used in a variety of films and TV shows. I could list them, but that's why they work so hard at Google. Keep them busy!Get there early and enjoy some free* entertainment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rubten

EXHIBITS: very intriguing & well-executed, making what could be dreadfully dry material into something truly compelling. DESIGN: Views from each level of the Observatory, at which there was easy access to the other floors. EDUCATION: Throughout each floor inside. STAFF: Pleasant. PRICE: Right/free! SPECIAL SHOWS: We didn't have time to see any. GIFT SHOP: OK; some very clever things, some rather uninspired & standard museum fare; however, a variety of price points were noted. Maybe I missed it, but I would've enjoyed more fun stuff for adults as well as more jewelry options than we saw. BONUS: The downstairs pathway's jewelry-bedecked wall with a planetary motif. How fun! & NOT SO MUCH - Didn't see any readily available info for those with different abilities. Few guardrails overall en route. Just one staff member noted outside of the observatory in the far parking lot. No signs re: going beyond fencing...A few kids, ~7-13 years, were walking ~10 min outside of a fence & precariously close to steep embankments, which was not fun to walk behind. One was crying when s/he jumped back to the safe side to presumed parents. REMINDER: Keep some quarters in your pocket if you venture to the Observatory decks~*",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PoppyPrisha
40,Awesome trails and cool if you like space stuff,Awesome views and trails free parking and neat museum if you ae in to space. I hear its best at night but the view during the day was amazing,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bak1010
50,Go in late afternoon,"You won't regret it, you must go! My recommendation is to go in the late afternoon and stay until it's dark because you get an amazing view of LA in both settings. You must do one of the shows, it's an excellent way to spend 15 minutes!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linbay
50,Very informative.,It is so cool to see so much land in the middle of L.A. Great views from here too. It's a lovely place to visit - I will come again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Buckyboyincanada
40,Nice place to view LA and take a hike,"Great place to see LA from above and take pics of the Hollywood sign. Griffith Observatory is closed on Monday and Tuesday if you plan to incorporate that into your hike. Several trails, but not well marked as to distance and where they start or end. Loved this gem of a park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariT66
50,Beautiful and scenic,"It's beautifully large; if we had more time to spend, we definitely would have gone for a hike. Instead we walked around a bit and had a little picnic, visited the Conservatory, & sought out the tunnel featured in 'Back to the Future 2' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'.I like to think if I was a local, I'd be all over those trails and star-gazing events.Very scenic view of LA and the Hollywood sign.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jainpkj86
50,Amazing,"Didnt expect this huge park in the middle of chaotic, urban mass that is LA. So much to see and do throughout this area. Good for walks and some steep hikes but difficult to get around main attractions without a car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CeeB_13
50,Great Day at the Zoo,"Los Angeles Griffith Park Zoo and Botanical Gardens., you will need a day to take it all in. There are a myriad of endangered species, many which are not found in any other American zoos. It is always a treat to go to the zoo, and LA zoo, although not as large as some, offers a day of entertainment coupled with educational aspects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyFamilyNow
40,Great Park,Love the Observatory - just don't visit on Christmas Eve - not a chance to park at all. Good view over LA and a nice place to spend some time - bit difficult to find your way round though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/docsov
40,Fun and Educational,"A great way to see LA from above and learn about astrology. They'd be better served with an online reservation system for shows playing in the building, and better guidance on parking. (I didn't want to pay to park so I parked down the hill from the observatory and hiked up to it which was fun, but after the show was over and I took all my pictures and hiked back down my car had been ticketed). Just be extra careful where you park and that you know all of LA's fun parking restrictions and good luck...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethInSearch
40,Amazing views and a great museum,"When visiting LA, head up to Griffith Park for great views of the city and Hollywood sign, hiking trails, and the observatory.Observatory has great planetarium show but arrive at opening to get seats.Entry to observatory is free but charge for planetarium.Check opening times carefully, as observatory often opens quite late, e.g. 11am.Lots of parking but can get full in peak times, leading to parking down road and long walk up, so again get here earlier.Nice cafe in the observatory for snack/lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarocheBabe
50,"Hiking in Griffith Park, CA","The next time you go to California and you're in the LA area, be sure to go to Griffith Park. We went up to the observatory which is excellent and what a view of the city you get but as soon as I turned around and saw people up on the mountain behind us, I knew I wanted to get up there. The next day we hiked our way up to the top of the mountain. It was a gorgeous day. You could see all the way to the Pacific Ocean. There were folks on horseback. As we made our way back down the mountain, we took a wrong turn, which was very easy to do because we were talking and looking at the amazing view. But we realized before we got too far down. We only had a few hours so we were not able to see any of the other sites in the park. But I will definitely go back the next time I'm there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KimF105
50,Watched the sun go down here,"It was fantastic, not too busy a bit of a trek but well worth it for the amazing view - we watched as the city lights became twinkly and then walked around the observatory but headed down before darkness! It was fantastic to have the hollywood sign behind us and the glittering city in front of us, would def recommend even if you are in LA for one day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lornsadaisy
50,A True Treasure!,"I think it is the largest ""City Park"" in the country. I know it is an amazing and diverse place.I mostly go there for dayhikes. I believe there are over 52 miles of trails.In the park one can find - The LA Zoo, Western Heritage Museum, The Observatory, Pony Rides, A Carousel, Picnic Sites, Bike Paths, Train Town, Views of the Hollywood Sign, Deer, Coyote and many other attractions including what is likely the best concert venue in America; The Greek Theatre!If you are visiting, this is one of the place to see, especially the Observatory.If you are a local and never considered it, well you are missing out! You are likely paying outrageous rent in a deteriorating city where it is increasingly difficult to earn a living wage so if LA starts to burn you out, (or you just want something to do or see) consider taking advantage of this treasure. Your tax money pays for maintaining it, btw. So it is YOUR park. ~ Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bentheredunthat
30,Too Crowded,There was a concert going on that is why it was so crowded. I'm sure i would have enjoyed it more if not for the crowd.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penoytraveller
50,An Amazing Museum,"Griffth Park is like Central Park in New York, a ""Must Do"". The Gene Autry Museum is world renowned for Western artifacts both from Movies, TV and genuine history with many notable items. The displays are informative and easily understood with many ""family friendily"" activities. There is a cafe, gift shop and plenty of free parking and easy access to the 110. The LA Zoo is across the street and the Train Museum down the road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PaulLori
50,Great escape from Los Angeles,"While the trail heads could have been better marked, my family really enjoyed taking the hike to Mount Hollywood. The views were great, in December the weather was just right, our fellow hikers were in a good mood and courteous. Great oasis in the crowded city. The view from the top was expansive, there are picnic table to enjoy a little snack. The observatory was closed, but I plan to come back to enjoy this another trip. Just beware that parking is rather difficult if you come in the afternoon. We arrived in the morning, so it wasn't too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSLAMT
50,Best view of Los Angeles city,"It was a little bit cold there but it was great. First of all is a free attraction. The isntallations are awesome. If you are someone that you love science you'll be loved of this place. If you dont you also will be loved of this place becuase the views are unbelievable. The beest place to be in dawn. We also saw the show in plnetarium, it is great and very interesting, this show is not free but is very cheap. You with no doubt should go to this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josearomero1

40,Griffith Park and Observatory,"Nice spot above LA. The day we visited there was a lot of fog so we couldn't see the city well, but my in laws say its a beautiful view looking down on LA. This is probably the best spot to see the famous HOLLYWOOD sign that you've all seen a thousand times in photos and movies.The observatory/museum is very interesting and the area around the observatory seems to hold some terrific hiking trails, although we did very little of that! Worth the visit when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charlip218
40,Nice park with good amenities,The park offers many facilities that meet the needs of families and large groups. The various areas and rides will offer something to everyone and the golf courses are good and relatively level.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Often overlooked,"We live in LA and have been here multiple times, but I think it is often overlooked by visitors. Great educational spot for children, conveniently located if your are going to Hollywood for any other event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisJ356
50,One place you shouldn't miss when you're in LA,"This is my third time to visit the Griffith park and it has never stopped to amazed me. The wonder of nature on top of a bustling city, a good escape from busy life to do just about anything you like. Do not miss to go to the Griffith observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OliviaQ
50,Beautiful,"We just loved the park. It's crazy to have such a park in the middle of a crazy city like LA. We were tired when we got there, so we laid under some trees and took a great nap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luisa341

50,Kids will have a ball,"We went to the train park and pony rides.... My 3 year old loved it, I mean really, really loved it.The train ride costs nothing and kids love the experience of going on a minature train which blows foghorns/whistles and all. The seats are a bit tight but the short ride (~10 mins) wont bother you and your kids will beg to do it again.Once you have been on the train 5 times, your kids will love the pony rides. Also VERY cheap, they have horses for all kids (up to 100 lbs I think). For small or scared kids they have very sloaw ponies and for the more adventurous they have larger ones which go slightly faster. While I don't vouch for them in terms of liability, they strap all the kids in really tight so they don't even have to hold on. My 3 yr old loved bopping up and down for a few minutes while his little colt jumped around the track. If you can stand the poo smell your kids will have a very memorable experience.For so little money I was really thrilled my wife found this place... my kid has not stopped talking about it.Also - there is no shopping there - which I found a huge plus!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/internationalist159
40,Amazing space in the city,"Picnic spaces, merry go round, golf course, free Shakespeare performances - what more could you want!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CJinCA

50,Wonderful place to get a great view of LA,"I was visiting with a friend in LA and she took me up to the park. What a great view of LA. We went up at sunset to see the Hollywood sign and see the lights come on in the city below. It was beautiful. There is a planetarium, lots of walking and hiking trails, a restaurant up at the planetarium that is open limited hours.If you are in the LA area this is a free place to get great views and a nice walk in nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerriTraveler
40,"If You're Visiting and Have the Time, Visit Griffith Park","My family and I had heard a lot about Griffith Park, so it ended up on our ""Must See"" list for our summer vacation to LA. We weren't disappointed. The park is much larger than we expected, so knowing where you're going is important. It didn't seem to us that there was a road that ran throughout the entire park, so we ended up having to enter the park at different places to get to a bike rental place (Spokes n Stuff) and the Observatory. We became frustrated, but that was attributable to our lack of planning and having a map that showed us where things were located in the park. Our GPS was helpful, but only in navigating the streets and highways that ran past and around the area.Anyway, the Griffith Observatory is worth your time (see my review) and we enjoyed renting bikes and riding around the park a little. Be aware that it is a mountainous and hilly area and also that, while there are some bike paths and lanes, it is sometimes necessary to ride on the park's roads.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jsctraveler
50,A must for runners,"Griffith park is a wonderful place to run. It has lots of trails. The hills are challenging and it has very nice views of the Holllywood sign, mountains and the Griffith Observatory.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/256MalcolmC

50,Nighttime View and Daytime hikes,"You know every LA view you've seen in a movie? Well it's shot from Griffith park.

Plus there's horseback riding, parks, and all kinds of fun stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeoffreyS81
50,Great Park,"Great for picnics, family events, they have golfing, horse back riding, hiking, summer night plays, and a vintage style Carrousel all in the same place. I drive throught the park every morning to smell the fresh cut grass and Eucalyptus trees. I have seen wildlife early in the morning and it is a great place for joggers and camping too. This a a great get afternoon get away that is local.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alycia602
50,Griffith Park is the best. Make sure to eat at trails.,"Hiking. Playgrounds. Griffith observatory, including one of the best views in the city. They even serve decent coffee up there.make sure to eat at trails though, by ferndale. It's right near where Western Ave. turns into Los Feliz Blvd. Walk through ferdell while you are there. It's man made, but one of the most beautiful spots in the park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markwT471OW
50,A nice day,"I enjoy Griffith Park alot and its been a part of my life since I was a very little girl. There are lots of things to do for kids. The train ride and pony ride is always a favorite. To get on the merry go round is always a must because its filled with music and very colorful. A great place for picnics and places where the kids can get on jungle jims and things like that. Its a great place for families, but its still a great place to just drop off and sit and have a quiet time for yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buddyone1
50,Went to Griffith park in style!,"Visited Griffith Observatory briefly on the Rasta Bus tour, my fiance and I loved it so much we took a cab back that night to view the stars!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trentl686

40,Biggest park in the US. Makes NY's Central Park look like a back yard.,"Too big. Focus on a few things: Pony Rides, the Zoo, The Autry Museum, The Carousel, Travel Town (if you have kids). For adults, it's a great place to play golf, ride bikes or hike. Get a map. It is easy to get lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariachurchill

50,Walt's barn at Live Steamers in Griffith Park,"Walt's barn is only open the third Sunday of every month for 4 hours but it is worth a visit. The volunteers are all very nice and knew a lot about the barn and the history of Walt's and Disneyland's railroad. It's a small area so it doesn't take long to walk through. Worth a visit for any Walt, Disneyland or Disney fans.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrynC92
50,Amazing views of LA,One of the best places in all of LA for views and great hiking trails. It may be a little crowded on the weekends but there are plenty of trails to explore. Also close to the Griffith Park Observatory. Fun for the whole family.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheSalvadorRios
50,Huge wilderness in the heart of LA,"Having lived in LA in the past, I return to Griffith Park as often as I can. If you're into hiking, pack water and a snack or a lunch and set off on the uphill trail from Griffith Park Observatory. It is long and varied in its vegetation and you can easily forget that you're in the heart of this sprawling metropolis. The view from up here is best at night. Park at the Griffith Observatory and marvel at the carpet of lights before you. And that's just LA, the valley being behind you. Even during the day, on a relatively smog-free day you can see the entire LA basin to the ocean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sequoialit
40,Huge green space in LA,"We drove through the park and decided to visit the Indian museum. The park is a huge pair of lungs in the hustle and bustle of LA. It has the observatory, zoo, museums a small train. A fantastic way to get some peace in LA LA land",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Sheermadness
50,Best place to see the Hollywood sign!,Beautiful views! Just a must see for anyone traveling to LA! The only thing negative I can say is that parking is difficult because it is so popular. But gorgeous especially at night!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CookingMama1
50,Amazing views,"Wasn't sure what to expect and didn;t think this would be for us but we really enjoyed it. Saw a 30min show on the 'Universe' for 7$ and we were totally amazed, it was interesting and educational but not a lecture. A very well written and presented show which was projected into the dome. A welcome change from the Transformers and King Kong rides, we ended up spending 2 hours here but if you are into stars and planets etc give yourself longer and take in a couple of shows.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RaymicheD

50,What a view...,"A wonderful way to see downtown LA and the Hollywood sign!I found the architecture of the Observatory rather impressive, my only regret was that we couldn't spend more time inside.Excellent trails, disabled parking at the Observatory, otherwise you would have to park some way down and walk up.A wonderful oasis away from downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CandiceM416

50,Excellent Park for a Sunset Hike,"Griffith Park has great hiking--I believe it's the largest urban park in the U.S. We hiked the Mt. Hollywood trail in the late afternoon, and it had terrific views of the Hollywood sign, downtown LA, Griffith Observatory, the Westside, etc. We also saw an amazing fiery red and pink sunset as we finished up the hike.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zengirl_10
40,Great view of LA skyline.,"Highly recommended, but make sure you plan enough time to both hike up and down (if you choose to not drive up to the Observatory). We went a little late and it seemed a little dangerous for two girls to be hiking up in the dark. The view and observatory was extraordinary. I just wish we could have enjoyed it before sundown. The museum has parts that you need to pay, but there are also parts that you can just walk into. You can also see the Hollywood sign from up there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EricaA890
50,relax amongst the trees,A chance to get away from LA's incessant traffic is well worthwhile. Eventually on the way to the Observatory we found some green spaces to relax on the grass in steaming temperatures. A nice restaurant on the left about a kilometer from the entrance offers fresh squeezed fruit juices. There is a public toilet but it is unisex which i didn't care for especially since there was a lady trying to change her baby (the diaper not the baby!) and there was no bench to help her rest the baby. Plus who want to change their baby in full view of the toilets!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bumbleboo
50,Always something to do here...,"Griffith Park (a gift from Col. Griffith J. Giffith) to the city of Los Angeles was a true godsend to us. There is sooooo much to do here! The L.A.

50,Amazing View at the Hollywood Sign,It was a pretty long hike to the top but well worth it. Make sure you have on some good sneakers and plenty of water as the trip to the top of the Hollywood sign can take up to two hours there and back down. I wasn't very smart as I did it with no water and some vans with no socks. Please don't make the same mistake but enjoy the wonderful views from almost every corner of Griffith Park.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SwaggsMcFly
50,LA's Gem,"I have visited LA many times on vacation or with my work and Griffith Park is always the place I spend my last day, beautiful sweeping views covering all of Los Angeles from it's highest point - The Observatory, the drive up is winding and narrow and on weekends people overflow park on the roadside near the Observatory as the car park is always full, so better to go Monday to Friday. There are many walking tracks, picnic areas and even horse riding trails around this massive park and I highly recommend you spend a morning or afternoon at Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ularu

50,Sprawling Beauty,"LA's answer to Central Park is harder to access (due to the fact that it's up steep hills and nowhere near train stations, making it, like most things in LA, nearly inaccessible without a car) but just as expansive and beautiful.In addition to the legendary Observatory, Griffith Park also features a zoo, a park filled with decommissioned trains for kids to climb all over, The Greek Theater, golf and tennis courses, charming restaurants, picnic areas (including the site of the old LA zoo) and miles upon miles of hiking trails that will give you an excellent workout and provide you with some of the best views of the city.Green public space is certainly scarce in Los Agneles, but Griffith Park is a treasure that we often take for granted. A wonderful place to spend a weekend day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SethG527

Most of the park is a mountain with hiking, views, equestrian trails, gardens, rides, museums, an observatory, a zoo, trains, and a lot more. One of my favorite places is the Old Zoo Picnic area which is the site of the old zoo where you can now eat your lunch in the bear cage if you want. Travel Town and LA Live Steamers are among the trains, the Griffith Observatory is work famous and has good views of the Hollywood Sign. On a clear day you can see the ocean and a great view of down town. There is too much to describe here. Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828

The lungs of LA, this park has numerous hiking trails, a zoo, an architectural gem of an observatory, a fabulous amphitheater graced with top-notch talent, a public pool, museum, an equestrienne center, and a train that takes small riders past some of the sites.

50,"A Los Angeles ""Gem""","Whether you come for the park, the hiking, the zoo, the observatory, the museums, or any of the other activities, Griffith Park is a true treasure for Angelenos.4,120 acres in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains just northwest of downtown L.A. make Griffith Park the largest municipal park with urban wilderness in the U.S. Most of the land was donated by Colonel Griffith J. Griffith (what a name) as a Christmas gift in 1896 to the people of Los Angeles. His generous favor continues to be a gift that keeps on giving more than 100 years later.Outdoor exercise options include golf, hiking, jogging, soccer, tennis, swimming, horseback riding, and more. Picnic tables, barbecue pits, and camping are all available, too. The park is open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.There are also plenty of sites to see. The most famous is the historic Hollywood sign which is visible from many hiking trails and Griffith Observatory. Built in 1935, the observatory is one of the best sightseeing options in L.A. because it is free and views are often spectacular. The observatory is closed Mondays and Tuesdays.Other key destinations in the park include the 5,700 seat outdoor amphitheater built in 1930 known as the Greek Theatre, the Los Angeles Zoo (Adult $16, Child $11; 10 a.m. - 5 p.m.), or the Autry National Center's Museum of the American West (Adult $10, Child $4; 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. except Mondays).Kids may also get a kick out of the Travel Town Museum (Free/Donation; 10 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.), the 1926 Merry-Go-Round featuring 68 horses and over 1500 songs (11 a.m. - 5 p.m.), or the mile-long 1948 Griffith Park Southern Railroad (10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.).Entrance to the park and parking are both free.

Also no trash to be seen.Remember to bring your own drinks and food since there are no kiosks anywhere.

50,Recreational Park in the middle of Los Angeles,"When one grows up and lives in a city for several years, it's easy to take some things for granted. This has been particularly true for me and Griffith Park to which I have had significantly more connections with than the average Angeleno. I lived in project housing, Roger Young Village, in The Park from the age of about 3 until I was about 7 (1947 to 1951). I started school and went thru 2nd grade in Griffith Park. We actually walked to the L.A. Zoo on a school field trip once or twice. I took swimming lessons just outside Griffith Park at the local swimming pool. Whenever we returned home at night from visiting relatives in other parts of Los Angeles, I revelled as a kid at the colors on ""my fountain"" just outside The Park at Los Feliz and Riverside Drive.Today, a group of runners meet every New Year's Morning at about 6:30 at The Pony Ride just inside the park near the Los Feliz entrance to run to The Hollywood Sign. The round trip is about 14 miles, 7 miles up and a faster 7 miles down. We finish off the morning with a ""pot luck"" buffet picnic brunch.In addition to a multitude of spots for having a picnic in the park, one can also enjoy The L.A. Zoo (that I visited several times a year while I lived in The Park), The Observatory (that I visited first in elementary school), The Carousel Merry-go-round that I rode as a kid, The Gene Autry Museum (across from The Zoo), In addition, one can take young children to The Pony Ride or the Model Train Ride. Horseback riding is available from stables just outside the park.There are numerous hiking trails in The Park and one of them can take you by the Observatory and to The Hollywood Sign.Use of Griffith Park and parking in the Park is free.

The train was $2.50 a person, merry-go-round $2 a person. Bring cash for the merry-go-round. There are bathrooms that were relatively clean, close to both rides. The train route is not very scenic for adults, but for a toddler with a big imagination, it is a lot of fun. The merry-go-round goes fast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hotspicedtea

You can experience fairly large redwood trees(some over 100 ft tall) in this area, along with a wonderful cafe with homecooked scones, pies, and other baked treats(Trails Cafe). The fairly short hike to the observatory is beautiful, and there are several trail options you can take , depending on the temperature. I have hiked numerous trails here for over 30 years, and I love this place. There is a spectacular ridge trail that is located to the east of the Mt Hollywood summit, and there is not a more spectacular night view in the city than from this trail, where you can simultaneously view both the San Fernando Valley and the city of LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/baybee63

Parking on weekends or holidays can be a challenge. If you can't find parking on the lot, you will have to park on the street and walk up the hill. A perfect activity for kids, families and out of towners. If you are driving from the west (the westside), try avoiding Santa Monica Blvd. because it is extremely run down in this part of town.

30,Good views/below average hiking,"Griffith Park hiking is a nice alternative to the typical urban activities. That being said, if you are a hiker from moist climates, this will be disappointing. We did the Mt. Hollywood hike and the trailhead is found immediately upon entering the Observatory parking lot. It is well-marked with a blue street sign. The hike took us about an hour and a half and was relatively easy. There are some steep grades though so anyone who feels they are not in decent condition should be prepared to double that time. Also note that it rained the night before and the hike was not muddy. The soil is very sandy so anything short of a monsoon and you should be fine to hike. Also, on-site restrooms in the Observatory parking lot are convenient and the parking is free.I think driving to the observatory is great to get a panoramic view of the LA basin, but I'd forget about hiking. First off, I've done a fair amount of hiking and, in general I don't find LA-area hiking that great. There are some exceptions but I won't go there now. Griffith Park is plagued by the problems found most everywhere in LA hiking. There is no shade. You will be in direct sun for 99% of your hike and there are no creeks. The only thing you will get are big views and that's great, but to me it wouldn't be worth it if the temperature is above 85. If you want exercise in the Hollywood area I would recommend Runyon canyon so you can people/dog watch. You can always drive to the observatory, see the view and leave. There was a huge crowd with lots of traffic as well, which also detracts from your hike. Another alternative is to go for a nice walk in Hancock Park or Beverly Hills and look at the beautiful homes. The only way I will return to Griffith Park is to do a night hike, which I'm sure is fantastic with all the city lights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HeathCalabasas_CA

50,Great and Scenic Hike,"This is a super convenient hike for those in the LA area, and it has amazing views of the skyline and Pacific ocean (so long as you can see through the smog). What's nice is that you can tailor the hike to your skill level - there are a few shortcuts that are steeper, or longer more meandering trails. There's also the option to add a few hours to your hike and walk over to the Hollywood sign. Roundtrip from the observatory, the hike took myself and few other 20-somethings about 4 hours!

I don't care to hike into my park with young children.However, I joined a runners group that ran through the park and it was fantastic. With my older children, we enjoyed some horse back riding.

50,Griffith Park-a Perfect Place for Hiking and Hangin' Out,"One day, on my hike in Griffith Park, it occurred to me that, in a way, I’m living my dream. On the hills, I’m not the mundane over-the-hill (no pun intended) person I sometimes feel like...no!... I’m an explorer, an adventurer, a thrill-seeker! And I’m out there on my own!Hiking in Griffith Park is a spectacular experience. The park is a huge expanse of hills, trails, places to play for people of all ages. And tucked in the midst of such committed civilization, it’s a great wonder and respite. The trails wind sensuously around the hills, in and out of the sunshine and the shade, up, down and around, leading to new experiences around each turn. Taking a new path is an adventure...who knows where you’ll end up!This is my favorite time of year. The air is cool, brisk, damp. In the sunshine, I love to feel the warmth on my skin...holding my face up toward the sky, feeling the sun’s caress, I’m in love. In the shade, I get to experience the cool breezes and enjoy the engulfing smells. Ahhh, it’s heaven.Usually I hike alone. Naturally, there’s lots of time for expansive thoughts and observations. In the fresh air and sunshine, my mind clears, my body energizes and my spirit expands. I wonder a lot... what those people are talking about, how that tree stands so straight with half it’s base and roots hanging out of the side of the hill, how that little girl managed to hike up so high. I see squirrels playing, birds soaring... Once I saw a coyote and, quick as that, he disappeared. I wonder if these animals are permanent residents here, or just transients. I wonder what it would be like to live here, in the woods. The other day two doe scampered across the path right in front of me. I caught my breath, then laughed with another woman, sharing the excitement...the exhilaration of wildlife!I almost always have a smile on while I’m walking....I’m sooo happy. I smile at fellow travelers, sometimes saying hello. Most of the time, my greeting is returned. I don’t take it personally if it’s not, but then I wonder why it’s not and what’s going on for those people. I wonder, and I’m grateful, that not more people are on the trails. Today I heard a woman, hiking with two others, complaining about “the f...ing baby.” I didn’t hear the context...but in the surrounding silence and beauty, her words were jarring. I wonder why others go there...just to get exercise, fresh air, sunshine, be in nature? What I believe is, Griffith Park is a haven in my back yard just for me.I love all the sensual aspects of being in this place, but mostly I love the smells. The exertion of the hike makes me breathe deeply, and I consciously take in those breaths analyzing each one for it’s special flavors. Surrounded by all sorts of foliage...trees and bushes.... I sense a little evergreen here, a hint of rosemary there...a grand repast for my nose!Sometimes I hike with my friend Julie. She and her husband are real HIKERS....for miles, for hours. Sometimes they go to exotic places, like the Angeles Forest, but she loves Griffith Park, too. Most of the time, after our hikes we stop at Trails, the cafe at the base of one of the paths leading up to the Observatory. There we enjoy superb coffee and scrumptious food and it’s always a joy to hang out at that cozy spot after a good workout. I love being able to share this experience with a good friend.I began this essay by claiming I’m “living the dream.” It has been, and continues to be, a deep desire to spend more time in nature. Happily, I am able to accomplish that goal through the bounty of nature that surrounds me as an Angelino...the ocean, the mountains. Given the choice of any place to live, this will certainly do for now!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BeverlyMay

I started out from Los Feliz climbed the first mountain to the Griffith observatory. But on that day my purpose was to exercise, so I skipped the observatory. I was going to go back down the same way I came up. But I am afraid of heights and it was so steep to go down. There are no rails or anything to hang on to, so if you go, you need climbing poles. So instead I looked for another way down. I ended up going across and up and down the expanse of about three mountains, I was trying to make it to the Hollywood sign. It was getting late so I decided just to find my way down.

50,"Griffith Park Observatory and Hiking Trails are popular, must visit places!","Griffith Park, Observatory and Hollywood Hiking TrailGriffith Park is a very popular place for local and out of town hikers of all ages and abilities. My wife and I took 4 hikes there in late Dec, 2011.  We hiked happily on trails of medium difficulties, varying in distance of 2.5 - 6miles. Besides typical hikers with backpacks and hiking sticks, we also saw young mothers pushing strollers, following happy, toddler screaming oh's and ah's,excitedly pointing at everything; as well as plenty people like us in the grandparents age group, some of them using walking canes! Of course, there were numerous young legs running up and down some steeper slopes, too, naturally! Everywhere on the trails, which wrapped around the mountain range, were friendly and happy people,  walking, hiking, or running, many with dogs of all breeds. We heard several different foreign languages (in addition to the common Chinese and Spanish) spoken on our hikes, so it was obvious that this park must be quite popular to foreign tourists as well.Among the trails we hiked, we loved the easy and long Hollywood Trail most,  going up from the Observatory to the top near the iconic, spectacular Hollywood sign. We branched out to several other side trails along the way, and managed to cover a 5.8mile loop (we used iMapMyFitness GPS program for tracking). Almost everywhere on the trail offered spectacular views of the landscape and the misty skyline of LA.  We also hiked the trail from the Observatory down to the nice picnic area of Fern Dell (2+mi round trip) - a tranquil, picturesque trek, with only a few steeper, slippery sandy sections.  Around 5pm, we even witnessed a spectacular sunset! Wow indeed!We loved hiking on Griffith Park trails, and will definitely go back for more - and there are so many trails there to choose from! Too bad we don't live in LA!One wish, though: - Hopefully, our Griffith Park Rangers would some day put TRAIL NAMEs on signs at Trail Heads and Trail Forks. [Except for the Hollywood Trail Head, we did NOT see trail names on any other trail heads!]By the way, the Observatory itself is a must visit for all ages! It's architecturally beautiful, inside and out, not to mention its multi-million dollar views from all vantige points. It has many fun-filled, educational exhibits, inspiring and informative lectures, demos, planetarium shows, etc., - most of which are free!  The rangers told us, with great deserving pride, that it took 6yrs to rennovate this old historical observation, built back in the 30's[?]! It is open from Wed to Sun, up to10pm. We were surprised to see the night crowd busily streaming in after 5pm - so it is just as popular evenings!Peterskis, 12/31/11",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Peterskis3

40,Off the beaten path this place gets real quite,Hard to believe you are just North of downtown LA and next to I-5. This park can be very serene as you walk deeper into it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/V4844ZHdavidb
50,Beautiful views and free admission!,"This is a beautiful museum with 360 views of Los Angeles. The museum itself is free, unless you want to watch the observatory show which is around $7. It's definitely worth it. If you're into hiking this is also a great location. A must do while in the Los Angeles area!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wrldtraveler365
40,Great oasis in the city and so much to do!,"Great walking paths, picnic areas and the zoo! Christmas time has the light show and the Gene Autry Western museum is right there. Something for everyone. Parking is easy also.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/levisgaulin
40,A hidden gem right in the center of a vast metropolis,"Visitors to Los Angeles are usually confined to the worm's eye view of a vast city. They see the view from traffic-clogged thoroughfares like Ventura Boulevard or Santa Monica Boulevard: an endless sequence of muffler shops, fast food joints, auto body repair shops and mini malls. If that's all you've seen, you have not seen anything in this spectacular metropolis. Here's a tip. When you visit Los Angeles, head for the hills! Get the bird's eye view of the city. One of the best free attractions in LA is Griffith Park. Miles of hiking trails on rugged hills with glorious vistas in every direction: North to Burbank and the San Gabriel Mountains, East to San Bernardino, West to the Pacific and Catalina Island, and South to Rancho Palos Verdes. There are miles of horseback trails (and a little horse ranch in Beachwood Canyon where you can rent a horse), miles of paved roads for bicycles, and both groomed and ungroomed hiking trails. Get out of your car and move around and enjoy the spectacular LA sunshine. Bring your camera and plan to end your hike in the late afternoon when the long rays of light filter through mountain pine and the sycamore and live oak trees in the canyons. Glorious and good for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Superplex
50,The best open space around,"Whatever great foresight caused the creation of this place, with its zoo, golf courses, picnic areas, fountain, kids amusement train and pony ride, carousel, cannot be repeated oft enough. Enough variety and geography to keep one amused for a lifetime. A city treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clemmie_11
50,Awe inspiring! The view at night is overwhelming...,"The view of Los Angeles from Griffith Park is awe-inspiring.....To capture the intensity of the view is impossible. Los Angeles is such a city on the go, traffic jams, shopping malls and parking lots and to see the city from up above made me feel so small in this big world. It was overwhelming, breathtaking and inspiring all in single view. I fell in love with LA in this moment.....maybe it's a bit overdramatic, but Griffith Park gave a bird's eye view to love of a city that otherwise seems tacky and a bit artificial. Simply put, no LA experience would be complete without checking out the real stars from Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdsuperstar
50,Go during the week for better parking!,Huge beautiful park with walking trails every where. Can be hard to find parking if on a weekend but weekdays have plenty of space.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CherylandBrett

30,"It's good, not extraordinary","The park is nice, good for a jog, run and explore the nature. I didn't find it extraordinary though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ragdias
40,Did you know...,"Griffith Park is actually larger than NYC's Central Park in land mass. Basically Griffith park is a mountain with stuff to do all over the park. Horseback riding, Zoo, Museums, Travel Town, camping, hiking an the famous Griffith Park Observatory (seen in so many movies). Everyone will find something to do in Griffith Park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalenacole
50,what a fun park,It was nice and relaxing. Beautiful Home to drive past.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jackey_sDad
30,"Nice park, but signs are inadequate and closing time confusing.","This isn't a park like Central Park in NYC or whatever, it's a huge sprawling hilly place with numerous trails going off all over the place. We were up for a hike of a good couple of hours, and eventually found the Ranger Station. Maps were provided free, although they seemed a bit baffled when we asked if they could recommend a trail that would last a couple of hours. Didn't seem that odd a request, we wanted a decent circular walk, but what they suggested was only a mile?Anyway we eventually picked something and drove to the merry-go-round car park, which is also where a number of the trails started. Here there was a problem, although we had a map, there were numerous pathways leading off from the car park and none of them had signs indicating which is which. We've done plenty of State Parks etc in the States over the years, we've never encountered one that doesn't at least indicate at the start of each trail which is which, with the occasional marker along the way as well.Well we guessed which trail was the one we wanted, however after 15 minutes we came across some sort of event that was being set up in the park and decided we must have taken the wrong trail and had to double back and try another, which I think was the right one.The trail was perfectly pleasant and we carried on for a while until it started getting quite steep, and then the trail essentially stopped, and two pathways lead off from the dead end. We weren't sure which to take, neither were on the map, and the general rule seems to be ""stick to the trails,"" so we were a bit confused. As we wanted to get to the top of Bee Rock, we pressed on up one of the steep tracks and were greeted with a fine view from the top.It was after 1700 by this time, and we had seen that the park closes ""at sunset"". We weren't sure what this means. Most places would say, eg 1800 closing May-October, a definitive closing time rather than something as subjective as ""sunset."" So we made our way out, not wanting to get locked in or anything, but saw plenty of joggers and dog walkers entering, so I guess we cut our walk short a bit for nothing.We're not fools, I just wish all this stuff was made a bit clearer, that's all!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jk80
50,Great Views and BEST OF ALL = FREE!!!!,"This has terrific views of the LA and canyon area! You have some of th best views of the Hollywood sign here, best views of the city, and you can see Griffiths Observatory (although, I couldn't go in because it is closed on Mondays)!!! The tunnel to get to the observatory and some of the trails was in the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit (tunnel to toontown) and it was also the tunnel used in one of the Back to the Future movies. It was really a neat place! Definitely worth a stop!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lullabystar
50,Great Hiking and Views!,"I LOVE Griffith Park! I'm surprised that Griffith Park is only #11 for Los Angeles Attractions, I'd think it would be 1 or 2!Inside Griffith Park, there's tons of hiking for all ages and levels, the Observatory, the famous Hollywood Sign, and beautiful views of the city!I live in Los Angeles, and find myself hiking Griffith Park at least once or twice a week. There are free guided tours by the Sierra Club from level 1(easy) to 5(strenuous) every weekday at 7pm. I love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/somewhereinthewest
40,Travel town - a train lover's paradise,"This is almost my son's favorite place, 2nd only to riding Casey Jr Circus Train at Disneyland. Though Griffith Park has a lot to offer, we seem to only have time for Travel Town on each visit. There are actually 3 train rides offered at Griffith Park and Travel Town seems like a long drive away from the park entrance. You must past the horse and train ride offered at the park entrance, drive past the LA Zoo, past the Carousel, and go through some construction until you the train museum and at the very end is Travel Town. Admission is free but expect to spend a little at the gift shop and for the train ride. I would also recommend wearing a hat and/or sunglasses as this is an outdoor attraction.There are huge locomotives, passenger cars, and many other old train cars. You can climb up into some of the locomotives and see their inner workings and sit in some of the passenger cars. My son likes to look out the locomotive window like a conductor. We walk along and on the tracks, which is pretty cool since I wouldn't normally be so close to them.There is an building which houses some old train cars and has a kid's play area. It is also home to a model train club which has a very nice display that is set up where the kids can watch the miniature trains drive though tunnels, over bridges, and through the town. They are currently doing some remodeling to their display but the kids are still fascinated.The gift shop has a very nice selection of train merchandise, including Thomas, Chuggington, and Dinosaur Train, They have toys, clothes, posters, signs, party supplies at very reasonable prices. We try to buy only one thing every time we go and this time we got a modern trains poster for $12.99+tax. (I went home and looked for more train posters online and the sites were selling them for $21.99 + tax + shipping!).We ended our visit with a ride on the train. Tickets are $2.50 per person. Children 19 months ands younger ride free. It's almost always a full train every time. The train goes around Travel Town twice and takes about 10 minutes. Try not to sit too close to the front due to the engine smells.If your child still hasn't had enough trains for the day, I suggest going for lunch at the Pasadena's Del Mar train station, La Grande Orange Café. Ask for a table near the door or windows looking out into the courtyard and you can see the trains passing through and train gates opening and closing with all the lights and sounds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradleysmom
40,Beautiful views,"While visiting LA with a friend who had never been there before, we wanted to do a lot of the ""touristy"" activities. I had heard that Griffith Park (specifically the Observatory) offered some of the best views of the Hollywood sign so we decided to check it out.Being a Sunday, we knew it would be impossible to find parking in the Griffith Observatory lot, so we ended up parking on the side of the road and walking up about a mile or so. By the time we reached the Observatory area, seeing the Hollywood sign was secondary to enjoying the incredible views of Griffith Park and the city in the distance.If you are visiting LA and looking to get away from the city for a few hours, Griffith park is definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jwanderer57
40,Wonderful views,"Went here early evening, so had day and night views from the Observatory Grounds, stunning views over LA. The day we were there the Observatory was closed - so cannot review that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bentlegs
50,"Pony rides were great, train was good","Our kids LOVED the pony rides. Only $3 for 2 times around the track. The little train was also good - but not as great a value $2.50 each ($10 for all 4 of us)... it did last about 7 minutes, so better deal then the mall ones... and at one point it goes through a little wild west scene area. We did not make it to the carousel, but other parents in line were recommending it. Bathrooms were gross - like you expect in public park I suppose, women's room had soap but then no running water! men's room apparently had running water, but no soap!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dg_in_ca
40,A cheap day out,My kids loved the train and pony rides. They are 8and9. Also went to zoo. Reasonably priced. Not that pretty but natural. Lovely views from observatory.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/latham_10
20,Too busy - too many roads closed,Tried to visit Griffith Park one afternoon in late July 2011. Bad mistake - lots of parts of the park roads were closed and the main road to the Observatory was full of parked cars. Couldn't get near the place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SimonB61
40,Great place to relax,"Great place to relax and get away for a while, when you are bored shopping.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OttoDerFlieger
50,Definately place to go with Kids & friends,"If you want to play and have fun with your kids, family and friends - then this is the place to visit. Its a huge park and hence there are no issues with spaces or anything - everybody can do whatever they wish. Lots of shady trees and hence the entire atmosphere is very relaxing.For kids - the park has carousel, pony rides, bike rentals & a small train (even adults can enjoy the train ride !!!). My 4 year kid with her friends thorougly enjoyed our one full day of picnic here. We didn't go to the zoo which is attached to the park - but had lots of fun either ways.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/domino007
50,Try the Hollywood Sign hike and have fun exploring the rest of the park,"I may not have been able to experience Griffith Park to its full potential, but it was easy to tell that it is a quality public area. There is absolutely no funny business: very clean, grass always green, very cheap, but still endlessly enjoyable. The hike on the Hollyridge leading to the Hollywood sign was breathtaking. The views were some of the best I've ever seen, and undoubtably the best in Los Angeles. No matter how long you stay in LA, be sure to visit this park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BenjaminOdom
50,Wonderful Wilderness smack dab in the middle of America's second largest city.,"NYC has Central Park, LA has Griffith Park.What does Griffith Park have that Central Park doesn't?Coyote sightings, Deer sightings, Rabbits everywhere, 360 degree views where you can see Downtown LA, Hollywood, (and the sign), the mountains, (snow capped in winter) and the ocean. We've hiked almost every single mile of the 53 miles of trails in Griffith Park and it's a great way to exercise and get back in touch with nature within 5 miles of my house. If you're going for the first time I suggest going early and parking right after the tunnel then stroll up Mt. Hollywood drive. It's a paved road, but closed to traffic. This route is less busy than main trail that starts at the Observatory...and less dusty too. From there, decide how far you want to hike that day. You'll see several trails shooting off the road up the hill or if you follow it all the way around you can make it to the Zoo or even to the carousel.If you want to make it all the way to the Hollywood sign, follow this street to a dirt road, (labelled Mulholland Hwy on Google maps) that juts off to the left, but be careful of the ""contributions"" from the trail horses that use this road. At the end of this trail you'll reach another closed to traffic paved road, (Mt Lee Dr on Google maps). Here, go left to get a great view of the front of the sign or go right and follow the road to the top and you'll be just a few feet behind the famous HOLLYWOOD sign.FYI: Good, clean restroom facilities at the Observatory parking lot. Ten times better than the ones at the bottom of the Fern Dell Drive entranceIf you're visiting LA for the first time, take a half day and treat yourself to a visit here...if for nothing else, come for the views.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Boston-LA
50,"Visiting LA? Skip the theme parks, bring the family to Griffith Park instead","The LA Zoo, pony rides, a train museum and a mini steam engine that kids can ride, a merry go round, a super cool playground, the Griffith Observatory.... all this and more! Often overlooked when people think of visiting LA, Griffith Park has a ton of fun activities, expecially for families, and most are either free or rather inexpensive. For those without children, there are also miles of beautiful hiking and the Greek Theater.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgirg
50,"Great place for a hike, picnic, or bbq with the family!","I love this place! During the summer, my dog and I go out there for long hikes at least 3 times per week. The park is full of families, which is great to see! Lots of good spots to have summer picnics, relax in the grass, and enjoy nature in the middle of LA. Highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonKeedo
40,Great place for train rides,"We were there two weeks ago for a birthday. Both my children loved it. We went on the train ride a few times, and then ton the pony ride. The kids had a great time. It was nice to be outdoors and have the kids run around. We went during the week and it was pretty busy for a weekday. Take a look at the link below, it describes the train ride offered at Griffith park as well as other locations around Los Angeles.http://fascinatedwithlife.blogspot.com/2009/09/train-adventures-around-town.html",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fallforme
40,Urban Oasis,Griffith Park is great as far as I am concerned. There is so much to see and do here. If nothing else it's a great place to unwind and have a family picnic and enjoy great views of LA. The only downside I see is that there can be a lot of graffiti in certain areas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/saphireLA
50,Griffith Park Unfiltered,"If you spend any amount of time in L.A., you need to visit Griffith Park. It is probably to Los Angeles what Central Park is to New York City. I have been there at least 100 times or more, over a good 15 or more years. One thing you can say about it is that you will never have trouble finding parking, as it is abundant and you can pretty much park anywhere. I go there mainly for hiking and the happy feeling of being around all sorts of people in a very Hollywood-meets-nature setting. Beware though: there are a lot of homeless, crazy folks, people doing drugs, men looking for quick hook-ups, straight couples making out in cars, gangster types with their annoying pets, and at the top there can be an insane amount of people visiting the observatory. Just park your car along the curving roads that lead up to it. There is a good flow of traffic going up and down, so I've never had anyone break in to my car. Believe me, you will save yourself a lot of frustration if you don't try to pay for the parking at the top. Ask anyone who has ever been there if they ever sailed right into that area and just parked. Really, I don't see what the big deal about the observatory is anyway. I love my city and I love Griffith but I rarely go up to that area.The rest of the place - the winding roads, the views, the sense of being somewhere very special, all make up for it. 90% of the people are just there to relax and have a good time, but you will want to keep your eye out for the other 10%. Better for you to know that before you go . . . again, I'm sure Central Park is the exact same way. The chaparral surroundings make for a one of a kind California experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Forgottensage
50,Lovely spot right next to a major city,"We live in Burbank, CA which is on the backdoor of Griffith Park. We love Griffith Park.We've gone there for picnics, rode on the Walt Disney merry-go-round, taken pony rides, riden the kiddy train, walked through the Christmas lights in November/December, and been to the nearby Los Angeles Zoo.We would like to one day rent some bikes and go biking as well as see the train museum on the north side of the park. Additionally we have yet to go to the Observatory and do some hiking. All which we will take out time to do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caligirlburb
50,"Wilderness & Fun Activities, too...","Griffith Park is not only the largest municipal park, but it has alot of fun activities, too. The Observatory is being renovated right now to a state-of-the-art complex, but the lookout point from there is great. Also, there is the zoo, Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, pony & wagon rides for the kids, a great miniature train ride, a train museum, and a carousel. Also, there is golfing, horseback riding, hiking trails and many picnic areas...all of this in a wilderness area in Los Angeles!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/loveLA
50,great view...,It is well worth making time to visit Griffith Park for the views of L.A.We went to the Observatory and spent at least an hour going through the exhibits.As well as a fantastic view of the city ( smoggy but good) you can also see the HOLLYWOOD sign ~ yiihaa.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/missytwoshoes
