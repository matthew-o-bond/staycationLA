40,A very nice place to shop and eat,This was our favorite mall when staying in Pasadena. It is not that big and nicely organised in 2 levels with practically no vacant shops. Atmosphere is relaxed and friendly and the assortment of shops and eateries very much to our taste being a family with teen kids. We kept coming back even thou we hadn't planned to :-),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelBG
50,Wish we had a place like this at home,The aesthetics of this space are clean and modern. There are delicious options for Asian food and we appreciate the large Uniqlo because we usually have to order online because there is no brick and mortar in our entire state!We love watching the turtles swim around and visiting the variety of stores. We never have trouble parking very close. We make a stop every time we are in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xietsanghua

There’s a variety of eating choices in the food court as well as around the mall. There’s a cinema too. There’s a small indoor play area for kids on the lower level and a bigger outdoor area on the upper level with a pond of turtles. The outdoor area also has many other stores and other eating venues. You can spend at least half a day just wandering around, looking, eating, sitting. My husband’s complaint is that there is not much for men to look at or shop for here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/545kareno

20,Visit to Santa Anita Mall,I was really disappointed with the mall....there is nothing interesting to see. No fountain....nothing artsy about it. The only thing I enjoyed were the horse sculptures outside the Food court.The mall has all these different hallways....it’s not like other malls I’ve been to. Thanks for the sculptures outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119yvonnej

40,Lots of Good Food Choices,"Over the years we've seen this mall grow bigger & more geared towards high end clientele. However even if you are on a budget it's still possible to have some fun - for example during Lunar New Year season they had a couple of weekends where there was free entertainment in the courtyard. My kid was actually part of the lion dance troupe that performed there, but the general public who happened to be there got a great free show & great photo ops & instagramable moments. Just check the mall's website under ""Events"" & occasionally you can catch free entertainment or other cultural or educational events.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NaomiK479
40,Enjoyed the atmosphere...,"I'm not a mall person, usually just find a place to sit while my wife shops. I found the architecture of this mall very appealing, combined with plenty of places to sit, made for a very relaxing afternoon for me, on a bench, in the sun, with book in hand. My wife did enjoy the shopping, said there were a lot of stores that we don't have where we live, but did not buy much as it was a bit expensive. Food court had a decent selection of places to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
40,Classy Mall,"I really enjoyed this Mall, the clientele were mostly Asian, its in a very posh neighborhood, and the architecture of the mall is really exquisite. I liked how there were atrium spaces with park like features, it was different from other malls",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanedwardazcueta
50,Lots of eye candy,"We came to this mall to go to the Hello Kitty Cafe, which was disappointing.The mall has a lot of high end stores, but not enough stairs, elevators and escalators.The food court is over the average, there are extra and better choices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithc951
20,This Place Is Ridiculous,"I grew up in this mall. I got my first real job at this mall, took Dial-A-Ride here as a kid and watched as it was taken over by the behemoth known as Westfield. Nowadays, just trying to find a spot to park is a ridiculous challenge and once done, it’s only to enter an indoor chaos full of overpriced shops, department stores and, of course, the Food Court.The Food Court at Westfield has various choices, several of which had nobody at all patronizing them. I guess even the mall isn’t immune to folks not wanting to eat what they don’t understand.All-in-all, I miss the homey cohesiveness that used to be our Fashion Park, but has become just another Westfield Shopping Center.This could almost be the one one back in Auckland, NZ.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sashmom1
50,Very Nice Mall,This mall is big and they take great care of it. Every time we go we enjoy our visit to the stores and restaurants. There is a play area for young children and it is well used and the kids have lots of fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donisland
40,Westfield Santa Anita Shopping Center,"If you like to shop and eat, this mall is for you! I have lived in the area for many years and it is amazing how much this mall has grown. This mall has it all-there is indoor as well as, outdoor space. If you don't want to stay inside, there are some nice outdoor stores and restaurants. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!! There is a large food court, with a variety of food. One can spend a full day here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCLCP
40,An above average suburban mall,"I've lived near this mall for years. It's gone through a couple of rounds of expansion, and is a very spacious, modern-looking shopping facility.Plus side: very large mall, ample parking (though stretched during peak shopping season), good food court selectionMinus side: traffic flow can be a pain (particularly at those busy shopping seasons), seems to *always* be under construction (it has been so for the last couple of years, at least)..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chuckm521

30,Parking,"Enjoy shopping here, but 95% of trips to this mall involve parking problems. Sometimes after looking for a space for 15 minutes or so, I just give up and go home. This mall has added lots of new restaurants and this has intensified the parking problem. I also find that some of the chain stores don't have as good a selection as you might see in other locations (i.e. Macys on Lake in Pasadena has a much nicer selection than the Santa Anita mall Macys. Same is true for Nordstrom, Talbots, etc). I will continue to shop here because it's convenient and there are many stores I like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/poodlelover2017
30,A great place to visit if you can find parking!!,"When I was a teenager I use to follow my parents to what use to be ""The Santa Anita Mall"", now it's a different name and it has grown by leaps and bounds! I moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 1993, lived there until I moved back to California in 2011....and that is when I made my way back to the mall! Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and it has all kinds of great shopping and food to eat, but you may have to drive around and around for parking unless you don't mind valet parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/888Theo
20,"Big Mall , not enough parking for handicapped",This is a big mall with lots of stores and some good restaurants but there is not enough parking for the handicapped andwe must pay to use the valet service which we have been forced to do everytime we have gone there.You would think they would offer a discounted rate when those who are handicapped cannot find parking but they are unapologetic.Certainly Westfield is not hurting for profitssince all the parking lots are jam packed .Certainly it says something about the philosophy and degree of character of thismassive business that is not American owned and owns many of the shoppingcenters throughout the United States,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tdeimel
50,The mall that has everything,"There are 3 main department stores (JC Penny, Macy's, and Nordstrom), 1 main food court with various fast foods, as well as restaurants that range from budget to fine dining in various places throughout the mall. The central Westfield area is full of clothing apparel/accessories, specialty, and boutique stores.The mall also features an AMC move theater that has IMAX screens, a Dave N Busters, and multiple kids play area and rest areas. Headlining restaurants include: Din Tai Fung (world famous soup dumplings), Wood Ranch BBQ & Grill, Cheesecake Factory, Benihana, California Pizza Kitchen, Hai Di Lao Hot Pot (top notch Chinese hot pot), and All That KBBQ.The Promenade section of the mall was newly constructed within the last 5-6 years and features more restaurants and shops as well as another kids play area.A hallway section of the mall with a very hipster vibe has been added as a the Promenade and the JC Penny side of the mall that features a Din Tai Fung restaurant and will soon see construction of a EMC (seafood restaurant + drinks) and a Backhouse (sushi + drinks).The mall also provides plenty of parking in various structures and outdoor parking. Recommended parking areas are the 4 story structure by the AMC theater and the 2 story underground structure by Macy's and Nordstrom.Located right next to the Santa Anita Racetrack and within close proximity to Arcadia High School and the Santa Anita Golf Course and park.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsDannyLin127

30,meh its a mall with a decent food court,ITs a mall catering to the lowest common denominator judging by the shops it has. Even the Nordstroms here has pitiful service and selection compared to its stores elsewhere.My favorite high end shops have all left and been replaced is restaurants. Go figure...a mall of food places with mediocre shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frazgo
30,Nice mall but more parking needed,"Mall crowded on weekends, parking becomes an issue. Got a dent on my car while parked there. Go early!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KingNat13
10,Typical Westfield - Bad,"If it weren't for the Nordstrom, the only one for several miles, I would NEVER go to this mall. It is impossible to find a parking spot on weekends. Most stores are junky, trendy, low-end shops, designed to attract teens and people in their 20's. Westfield fought a Grove type of development nearby and now we are stuck with this old style mall that cannot attract or retain quality stores.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler445
40,"""Nice shopping center""",This shopping center is well designed and clean. You will find the basic shops and more. Good points : have two playgrounds for kids one outside and the other inside. Have a food court and many good restaurants around the mall. Nice place to shopping.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PMT-76
40,Shopping experience is getting better,"The shopping center has been upgrading over the last couple of years and has added some higher end premium shops and also catered more to the growing Asian community in the San Gabriel Valley with additions like Wing Hop Fung and Ding Tai Fung to the mix; but it's all high class. There are times that parking can be difficult, especially on the weekends; however, we seem to have better luck finding parking in the below ground parking below the southwest portion of the shopping center, especially in the lower level. Unfortunately, the carousel is gone, but the shopping experience is definitely better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522

30,Great selection of food choices!,"This mall has its ebbs and flows however after the food court side opened with better tasting franchises in my opinion, the mall is more crowded than ever. Its gaining more traction as newer vendors open shop in this mall such as Zara, Din Tai Fung and Dongpo. What mall has 2 Auntie Anne' pretzel, Santa Anita does! The Potato corner always has a line on weekends and CPK got a facelift so that's always a popular place to dine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HKhereIcome
50,Nice for shopping,"Westfield is a great place to visit and spend an evening or an afternoon. This is an indoor mall with lots of really nice shops, food court, restaurants and coffee , ice cream and dessert places. There's also dave and Busters where you can play and have fun.

40,Wing Hop Fung Store at Santa Anita Mall for an Ethnic Adventure,"We stopped by Westfield Santa Anita Mall after our visit to The Los Angeles County Arboretum, which is right across the street! The mall had a variety of stores, shops and restaurants that you see at other malls, but, what fascinated us was the new Wing Hop Fung store on the second level. This was a sterile and organized, upscale Chinatown store! They had everything from dried sea slugs to hundreds of varieties of ginseng, elegant tea pots, Oriental appliances, Chinese and Japanese teas from $2.00 to over a thousand dollars! In one corner, there was a nice selection of sake, wine, whiskey and other liquor. In the opposite corner, Bird Pick Tea served a variety of teas with pastries. Try the delicate and fragile wafer cookies for your own tea party, or try the dried ginger treats to help with motion sickness. Most things were reasonably priced.Next door, Daiso, the $1.50 store was fun to check out, as well!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanHana

30,Not too shabby...for a mall.,"Let me start with saying that I am generally not a fan of indoor malls, as I find them a blight on the landscape. That being said, three stars from me means the Westfield Santa Anita is doing something right. The mall is consistently filled with shoppers and window gazers. Credit to Westfield for continually upgrading the quality of the interior and exterior spaces, and for bringing in newer retailers to keep things fresh. I'm not much of a shopper myself, but my two teenagers can wander the mall for hours without being bored. To the extent I buy anything, it would either be in the Macys or the Sport Chalet. There were two recent armed robberies in the parking lot (Jul/Aug 2015) so be careful when walking back to your car with your bags. Food options are pretty run-of-the-mill. There are better, and cheaper, alternatives nearby. (Remember that you are in the heart of the SGV and all its wonderful eateries.) As for parking, the least crowded area is outside the JC Penneys. I can find a spot right away if I don't mind the walk. The most crowded area is near the entrance of the movie theater/Cheesecake.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chumleyjones
40,Westfield in Arcadia,"A nice mall, well kept. It has a variety of stores that range from Macys to JC Penny to a small Disney store.

All in all, a good, albeit, typical mall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EpcotAl
