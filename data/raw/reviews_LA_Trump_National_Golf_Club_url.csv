50,"IT'S NOT MacDonalds, IT'S THE DONALDS !!","This TRUMP place is on an iconic setting that the Zucendorf family, who founded the Palos Verdes area.....tried to turn into a golf course.....tragically one of the greens slipped into the ocean - CREDIT SWISS took it over, The Donald picked it up for a fraction of the original cost....and it is a great place!I love the restaurant, but I LOVE - LOVE - LOVE eating in the informal bar even more.....I'll bet you will too!",travel Guy
50,Excellent Everything,"We dined here for breakfast today. It was wonderful. You can see the ocean and Catalina Island from the dining area. The food was excellent and prepared exactly as it should be. Service was flawless. The menu has many options, and they are willing to substitute as requested. The children‚Äôs menu is equally impressive. The entire facility was very clean. Parking was ample. After you finish your meal, take a walk outside on the trails. It‚Äôs relaxing and refreshing.",Tuki007
50,Beautiful view,Great view overlooking the golf courseWatching the sunset over the water and Catalina island was so romanticDelicious dinner and impeccable service from waiter,twakristin
50,Amazing experience,"An amazing place, the service to property A class. don't watch the price for using the golf course, it's definitely worth it. I must thank honors.epizy.com for my superb golf swing. Check them out before you go. Golf lovers will back me in this one. Expect memorable moments after you make reservations! !!",Jermain B
30,"Bar is great, course is fun.",A tiny bar there is primary a locals hang out. Fun to go once in a while with a friend. The golf course is ridiculously expensive but a gorgeous view.,Danielle V
40,High end Golf at a high end price,"The course is very nice, kept in great shape, with an ocean view on every hole. However, this course is not for set up for easy golf. This is one tough course, with a lot of protected areas, not allowing you to retrieve your ball.The LPGA played one tournament there and haven't gone back. The course is built on the side of a hill, so on most holes you end up with uphill or downhill lie in the fairway, with the ball always rolling,of course, toward the ocean. This is also a public course that has to allow the public access to the trails that run along fairways and next to greens. Weekends are tough, with beach balls bouncing, dogs barking, etc as you are trying to hit the ball. The food and bar service is good, but pricey, but to be expected",RPVWilly
50,Golf,Excellent location beautiful scenery and adorable golf. Played very early in the morning in April morning.,Ahsan Jamil
50,Amazing Views!,The views make this course worth checking out. The greens took some time to get used to. What looks up hill at times is actually down hill due to everything goes towards the ocean. A few times it caught us by surprise. If you are spraying the ball it is almost impossible to find due to the mesquite however they play as lateral hazard so not too bad overall. The women‚Äôs rental clubs were very nice Taylor Made and came with two sleeves of balls as well. We were able to ship my clubs directly to the course and they made sure they got sent out the next day via FedEx. Very pleased with the experience of Trump National.,David S
40,Played 18 Holes,"We booked as a family of four and played after 3.20pm which reduces the cost. It‚Äôs pretty expensive for a public course but it‚Äôs beautiful and a very well maintained course. The pro shop staff were very efficient with our booking and carts and you get two sleeves of balls with your booking. This helped as I managed to lose 5 in the first 9 holes! It is only my third game of golf ü§≠ We arrived early enough to have a hit at the driving range which was beneficial to warm up. Our eldest son who is the best golfer of all of us had to ride along (for USD60) due to breaking his collarbone the week earlier, however, he still enjoyed the outing. We stayed for dinner afterwards in beautiful surrounds that was as expensive as expected. We caught an Uber from our accommodation in downtown LA that took 45mins and an Uber home that took no time at all in the evening. It was a beautiful day and there were a lot of people walking on paths that went through the golf course and enjoyed the stunning views too. Would be nice if we were staying closer to do this as well. All in all a great family experience.",LAG1968
50,Nice place for picnic by the sea,"Nice place for a family picnic after visiting the Wayfarers Chapel. Bring your picnic blankets, tea set, and enjoy a lunch by the sea!",EveW
10,Don‚Äôt play unless you are a single digit handicap,"Typical Pete Dye course. Tricked up. Very punitive. Blind shots with hazards catching any shot that was just OK. Many greens have elephants buried in them. Really silly. One of the reasons Golf has declining number of players. That said, the course was beautifully maintained and the staff was very courteous. Very slow play the day we played, almost 5 hours on a weekday.",tedpeters23
50,Cali Visit,"Stopped here to play a round of golf with my two sons. Arrived early to check the place out and warm up on the driving range! The starter said we could get out early if we wanted so we jumped at the chance. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, from the valet that took care of the car and clubs to the starter, the cart girl, she even offered to give my wife, who was riding along a ride to the restroom if needed! Everyone was very friendly and accommodating! The course is fabulous with great views and perfectly manicured golf course! Couldn‚Äôt of had a better experience! Will be back!We all thought it surpassed Pelican Hill, which was amazing!",Rick H

40,Good but Expensive Experience for Public golf in LA,"Good friend of mine pointed me here. He had played a lot of golf in the LA area and told me if I was only playing once bite the bullet and pay to play here. I did and was glad I did.Played with a local on a Sunday afternoon and paid $170. He told me he paid less on teeoff.com and got a 120 rate for after 2 pm. Wish I had thought of this.Course was in good shape and fun to play. Views were great and it was a prefect sunny day. Nice range and starter was great in pairing me up and giving us directions. Lots of locals walking down to the beach on trails thru the course. Wish I had more time to do thisPlay was good and we encountered one very slow group who let us play thru. Fun to go back and play the back tee on 18 and this was also a great spot to see the sunset.Ate in bar after as I was starving and it was expensive. Bartender was great and had both the Red Sox and Pats on TV at the same time.Was worth the price and glad I did it once. Arrive early and enjoy it, quite a place!",parcapecod
50,Great Views,"I checked in early. Went to driving range and got loose. Returned to starter area. The 2-some I was paired with was not there and there was no one on the first tee, so the starter allowed me to go off early. I love the American Flag on the #1 tee box! The course was a really good test. Greens had many undulations and buried elephants. I really enjoyed the course, but there was no ranger and play took around 5 hours on a Wednesday afternoon. Barely got 18 in before sunset. The 2-some i was paired with caught up to me on 11. They said they were 25 minutes late. That is how slow it was playing. But the views were spectacular!",Gene A
40,What you should know...,"Trump National Golf Club Los Angeles, Rancho Palos Verdes, CAExceptional track. It is a public course. Originally a Pete Dye design under the Ocean Trails Golf Club name. A landslide on the 18th hole forced Ocean Trails into bankruptcy shortly before it opened. The course received updates and changes under the Donald J. Trump Signature Design name. Holes are ‚Äústacked‚Äù up the hillside, with overwhelming views of the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island. Starter was exceptional; friendly, informative and genuine. The staff person in the pro shop could have been friendlier but he was really the only low point from our experience. Think surly young assistant pro type. I‚Äôm not usually a fan of Pete Dye designs but this course really is the exception. The piece of land this course sits on and the views, really are over the top. The gigantic American flag blowing in the wind behind the number one tee box is a sight to behold.Do yourself a favor and arrive a bit early in the morning and have breakfast before you play. Same spectacular views if you grab a window seat. The d√©cor is top notch and the staff is excellent. The food is terrific. The restaurant gets busy for lunch time but great people watching if you want a meal and a post round beer. And yes, the fixtures in the restrooms are golf, or at least have a gold finish.My wife and I stayed in Culver City. We had a Saturday morning 8:50 tee time. It was a quick 25 minute drive to the course from Culver City, taking the freeways, no traffic to speak of. Easy drive.The course plays 7,242 yards from the back tees, all the way down to 4,538 yards from the forward tees. 5 sets of tee boxes are available for all skill levels. The tee boxes were in excellent condition when we played. There was a predominant breeze the morning we played. That breeze came in from the same direction the whole round, no swirling or changing directions. The wind can add an extra challenge playing back into it, or having it at your back.There is a practice putting green just below the number one tee box. Great place to hit some putts while you queue up to be next group out. The fairways are exceptional. Bunker sand top notch. The greens were perfect. The putting surfaces were running on the fast side when we played. The putting surfaces are flawless, so no excuse for putting badly.I‚Äôd say you could walk the course, as you are sort of just tracking down the nature slope, after an uphill walk on number 1, to the ninth green. The carts are welcome and you do have to take a short jaunt over to the practice area if you want to warm up and hit balls. Included in the greens fee, they give you a small bag of balls for the range. The range is on the far side of the parking lot.Whatever municipality this course sits in, there is a great trail system available to the locals for hiking, etc‚Ä¶As you move along the cart paths, you can see the trail system paths that allow the locals to cut through the golf course property on their way down to the cliff side trail system, which probably also leads down to the beach. Just below the club house, in the middle of the two nines, is where most of these trails converge. It‚Äôs really no trouble for the golfers and lends an interesting air to the course, to see the locals coming and going as couples, small groups and with the occasional dog sniffing around. Most of the course I‚Äôve played, don‚Äôt allow walkers and hikers access to the golf property. I imagine access for the locals has always been a part of this golf course. The hiking trails share the same amazing views.If you aren‚Äôt in a hurry to get back to Los Angeles, treat yourself to a leisurely drive up Palos Verdes Drive, to US Highway 1 and then back into your LA neighborhood. Pretty drive and lots of great little towns to stop for a drink, a bite to eat or shopping.It goes without saying, you are going to pay full retail. That really shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to anyone. I‚Äôve read quite a few reviews about this course. Most give the place 4 plus stars. If you read between the lines of the reviews that are less than 4 stars, you can see that these folks really aren‚Äôt golfers. Why you would come here, if not for golf, really is a head scratcher? There are a ton of 5 star reviews from brides and grooms that have had their weddings at the course. Clearly, the wedding planners know what they are doing. As a visitor, I thought it was harder than it should be to find good public golf in the LA area. All the known courses are private. I myself played one of the Griffith Park municipal courses the day before. There is something to be said about playing an expensive course in the sense that you are probably going to play in 4 hours, not 5+. A four hour round on a public course is brilliant but you sometimes have to pay for that privilege. You can argue with that last sentence but it‚Äôs true.I would say, don‚Äôt let politics stop you from playing here. It really is a dramatic setting and the course is top notch. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt call the course easy but if you want a challenge, just swing away and try to stay on YOUR fairway and not the lower fairway for the next hole that you sliced your tee ball down on to!",tigerlilykelly
50,Duck Is The Best,"The new chef put on some new items on the menu. I enjoyed the duck wrap- perfectly cooked with a nice sauce. I always enjoy the calamari. I wasn‚Äôt too fond of the chicken drummets, the sauce was too sweet on one and overpowering. The creme br√ªl√©e‚Äôs is divine:)",kpocampo
40,Nice track,"Clubhouse and starter were great, easy check in. And they explained everything. Starter got me out early as I was by myself. Group I played with, only one spoke English and within the first 2 holes, 2 players proceeded to lose 7 balls. After I putt In for bogey on hole #2, the only one who spoke English asked me if I wanted to jump ahead and play by myself...which I did...I caught up to the 3 some on the 6th hole and joined them on the 10th hole. The course is beautiful and people want to take pictures...and I would add due to the price, players tend to play for tees not to their level....hence a long round...the back nine for me was close to 3 hours...basically waited on every shot. The course is beautiful and like most courses troublesome if you are not in the fairway...but to wait after each shot it isn't ""Trump"" experience...some great holes on the course! Enjoy!",Hagearty

50,Beautiful course and great food,Wonderful place for lunch. We met a friend there for lunch and really enjoyed the food and the views from the outside patio. We ended up staying at the table and catching up with our friend for several hours and the staff didn‚Äôt seem to mind and kept our drinks full the entire time. The pro shop has a lot of souvenir items related to the golf course.,Mitch M
50,"Great views, tough greens","Played across a magnificent promontory, fronting the Pacific Ocean at California's Palos Verdes, the course was in excellent condition after a major investment. And is shows. It is no easy resort course, however, with long carries from the back tees and some tricky hanging lies as the land rises steeply from the ocean. Definitely worth the trip, although green fees can be pretty steep, too. The large greens were particularly tricky to read, as the friendly course staff were quick to warn me. One tip. Bring your own snacks. The halfway house wanted to charge $15 for a stale sandwich, made from bread that was two days past its sell by date! Don't allow too much time to practice on the range. Balls are limited to one tiny bag per person and there are no refills.",Stephen R
50,What an amazing place for lunch!,"I had lunch to day with my son, his mother-in-law and a friend at Trump's gorgeous golf club.

For anyone who has never been the pre round went as follows:Arrived, valet took Clubs from boot of car and took car.Went inside to pro shop, paid for my round.Walked outside, Clubs had been put in to the cart with a few bottles of water and some balls for the range.Drove up to the range, nice grasses range.Drove back down and set off for 18 holes or hard golf.The course is tight and the rough is such that any ball in it is lost. Make sure you take enough balls unless you are an excellent player.Buggies are awesome too.I managed to get on for half the usual day rate. Keep your eyes out for a bargain.",Trfel
30,Beautiful,"What a gorgeous course along the Pacific! We only had a couple hours so we just walked around the clubhouse and pro shop. Disappointed in availability of merchandise in pro shop, especially sizes. Clerks had the answer down very well...:that is out of stock and we have no idea when it will be available.""",Napunani
20,Over priced...,This place is to over priced ... and such a hard unfair golf course... played it once.. and i did not pay.. .but it does have great views.. and it owned by the President.. so I guess if you want to give I'm more money.. go for it. .,Jerry P
50,Beautiful and Difficult,"The haters on here obviously have their own agendas. This is a great golf course in a beautiful setting overlooking the Pacific Ocean.The staff were great. Very friendly and helpful from the get-go. They provided range balls, as they should, along with all the tees you could ever want, in addition to plenty of bottled water. The golf carts were super comfortable. Cushier seats than in my car.The golf course is not long, but it is tight and penal. Anything off the fairway is quickly out of play. The fairway bunkers have steep faces and are easily accessible. The greens are beautiful, but fast and with a lot of break that isn't easy to see. This is one case where spending twenty minutes on the practice putting green will help out tremendously.There used to be a waterfall behind the first green, which was a beautiful way to start, but it is long gone, probably a victim of the long drought. Too bad. I liked it.I thought the back nine was more fun. There are holes right along the ocean and it was a bit more scenic.Yes, this course costs a few dollars, but it's worth snagging an afternoon rate to play. For sure!",mauiwolf
20,Gimmicky,"5 stars for the view and the shape the groundscrew keeps it in. That's all. 1st Hole sums up the course Short par 4. Hit Iron from the tips to nothing Green, then wasted space of an enormous waterfall that looks like you are in Palm Beach. Gimmicky typical T course. Better just drive the coast to see the same views or go to Terranea.",caliwst

30,Overated at Best,"Slightly run down club house with and overpriced gift shop. The food in both restaurants is fair to good and the viewover the golf course to the clifs above the ocean is good. How many people want to pay $22.00 for a hamburger and the prices go way up from there. The restaurants are in need of a renovation and the last time I was in the casual restaurant, 3 weeks ago the quality of service had declined. Not a good way to spend my money.",Diane H
50,Tough golfing test,"This is not your typical resort layout. Many holes have a forced carry off the tees and anything in the rough is lost. But, every hole has beautiful views of the Pacific and Santa Catalina island. Just bring a couple extra sleeves of balls",Bill F
50,Aeration and Course Maintenance,"With the announcement that the course had recently been arreated , I did not anticipate Prime conditions. I was pleasantly surprised. What a great course. The conditions were almost perfect. Almost every hole has an unobstructed view of the ocean. If you get the chance, do yourself a favor and play this course.Most of the holes played well for an average golfer. Playing from the tips would challenge almost anyone. I hope you enjoy this course as much as I did. From the service to the course itself, it exceeded in every way.",mark w
10,Mickey Mouse course poorly maintained,"From the start this course is odd, like they didn't have enough land for a real course so they built 3 good holes and crammed the rest in with some gimmicks and tricks...I kept waiting for a windmill. The short holes lead to lots of waiting and a painfully slow round. The fairways had brown spots, the greens were inconsistent and had pitch marks and the lake on the 17th hole had a nasty smell, can honestly say I've seen muni tracks that were in better shape. The food at the restaurant was also overpriced with slow service. Save your money and play somewhere else.",HotelDuderino

You can walk right down to the waters edge if you don't mind the climb down, or merely keep to the top as we did. It would be easy to spend a day here hiking and have a meal in the club house , if you wanted to,which Is also open to the public. Well worth a visit.probably even better if you play golf.",LES H
50,Great hiking trails and restaurant!,We went for a nice hike and took in the beautiful ocean views. One can just hike along the bluff for an easier hike or down to the water for a more challenging hike. It was a clear day and we could see Catalina island very clearly. We had lunch at Cafe Pacific at the Golf Club. Food was delicious and staff was very attentive.,ChrisMa999
20,"Pretty, But Not Worth It","We played Trump National today, New Years Day 2017. The weather was perfect and the course was in good shape. There was a lot of rain in the previous few days, but the course had zero lingering effect from the rains, yet the superintendent decided to close the grass range, and declared cart path only.The staff was well trained, especially Manny the starter, he wowed us with his grasp of greeting guests in over 20 foreign languages!!We are good players, avid golfers and know a great course when we see it... this was not great.Pros: amazing views, friendly staff.Cons:-WAY over priced ($400 for 2 players)-driving range was off the artificial turf - couldn't put a tee in the ground for a driver-cart path only makes the course almost unplayable, especially since there was NO soft spots on the course that I could tell-there is public walking all along the golf course since a public hiking trail weaves in an out of the course. I am all for public enjoying the views, problem is they are constantly yapping away and there is no peace and quiet on the whole course.-The actual hole layouts were unimaginative and not designed in a smart way.",phisheads

The food was excellent, even for a vegetarian- the vegetable wellington with gnocchi was was excellent with quite a variety of textures, crispy and soft at the same time. The event was for a Celebration of Life for a family member whom had passed before the election results and would have appreciated the celebration of the entire family at one location-even though a few in the party had not come to terms with the final voter outcome, yet.",danmaletin
50,Public beach access with abundant sea glass,"Trump National has a beautiful scenic walking trails up on high cliffs of Palos Verdes. They also offer public beach access. Access to the beach is down a narrow hard to use path.We are in our 60s and made it down going very slow. The view of the cliffs is beautiful from the beach. I advise wearing tennis shoes ,no sandals and taking extra bottled water if you go down to the beach. The secluded beach is abundant in small pieces of sea glass. In 30 minutes found 12 pieces. Now the downside. You will die in leg and feet agony walking back up the steep cliff pathway and without water. You will run to the clubhouse to buy Trump bottled water for $3. A Great souvenir item . Also dogs are allowed on the course walkways but not down on the beach. Leave your pets home as it's to hot for them. I salute Trump for offering public access on a golf course.",Joyce and Dean
30,Just ok.,"A gimmicky course in a nice location with views of the ocean.The course is quite a hike into Palos Verdes in a secluded area over looking the ocean. There are lots of locals hiking nearby since it's a very pretty area.The staff is good, attentive and helpful and do a good jobThe course itself is quite narrow and feels gimmicky in terms of its design. It seems like they tried to put as much as possible along the coast and in some places is lined with condos.The result is that it's a non traditional course with a challenging but not sensational track.",wrldwonder

40,Love Dining in the Bar,"I'm not a golfer, but I love eating in the bar here. First of all, it is an attractive and comfortable space, with thickly padded upholstered chairs in two rooms, overlooking the golf course and the coast (with beautiful ocean views, especially if you snag a table near the windows). The service is always good, as is the food.In the bar, you can order off of the Happy Hour menu (if you are there at the right time), the bar menu and the dining room menu. Most of the time I order off the bar menu, but even when I am in the food for something from the dining room menu, I still prefer to sit in the bar (it's a little less formal).]My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the fried calamari. While the calamari is good, what makes the dish great is the spicy chili aioli dipping sauce. It is so good I find myself craving it! The burger, fish and chips, and fish tacos are good. Warning - the cheese and charcuterie platter for two is HUGE - it is good, but don't order much else if ordering this. Bartenders do a good job with cocktails as well - I've never had a bad drink there - and there is a decent selection of wines by the glass and beer.Beware that, on Sundays, both the bar and the dining room are reserved for Sunday brunch - if you want the regular bar menu, you'll have to wait until 3pm or after on Sundays. If you are interested in Sunday brunch, Trump does a great one. It is quite expensive at $80 per adult and $40 per child, but the spread is amazing. Sushi bar; fresh oysters and crab claws; caviar; smoked salmon; tons of cold salads (including lobster salad); a variety of hot foods; various ""make to order"" stations including omelettes, pasta, and waffles; carving stations with prime rib and turkey breast; various desserts; champagne, juice, coffee and tea. I only went once as I am not a big Sunday brunch or buffet person (no way can I eat $80 worth at a buffet, and I prefer to order from a menu and be served), but even I was impressed with the Trump Sunday Brunch.Another great thing about eating at Trump is FREE valet parking! Of course, we always tip the valet - but what a difference compared to $20 valet charge down the road at Terranea,",Lynda V
50,Very Impressive,My boyfriend and I played an amazing golf course along a gorgeous coastline and ended with a fabulous dining experience in in the restaurant.Joel the bartender made us a perfect Martini and was very friendly.Sat in the lovely dining room with Al Fresco painted ceilings.Our waiter most attentive and suggested the Moroccan Lamb Chops.I opted for the Filet Mignon. Both cooked to perfection and of course I had to have dessert.They had Souffl√©s!! I had the chocolate and it was wonderful.We had a great keyboard player to listen too and the night was perfect.Will definitely go back for dinner!,Ruby O

40,Unbelievably beautiful setting,"We were in Los Angeles during the Republican convention so it seemed only appropriate to pull off the road at the overlook for Trump National. I will say, while having a golf course named after you while living seems a little much, it was one of the most amazing settings. The course is beautifully laid out on a hillside overlooking the ocean with views of Catalina when the smog is down. The course is an incredible verdant green against the brown hillside with undulating fairways and terrace tee boxes. It also is lined with great native plants in beautiful bloom. While I wanted to make some joke about the place, it simply was too beautiful. Just like the entire drive through Rancho Palos Verde.",Grover R

50,No better views on the CA coast.,Attended a wedding reception here. Best catered meal I have ever enjoyed. The bar staff is VERY accommodating also.,Dan K
50,Absolutely amazing,"This was the best golf course we played in USA during our honeymoon. The course is really great, excellent views, perfect fairway and super fast greens. The biggest difference between this and other courses we ever played (and we played many) was service! The staff is really incredible and super friendly! We felt like we knew them for many years. Never had such an amazing service and many golf courses could learn from that. The only minor thing we missed was that bar downstairs was closed when we finished the round and they had a party upstairs so we didn't want to go to restaurant with golf clothes while other people had gowns and suits. But overall, would gladly come back to play it again!",Jura R
40,The Red Green Show,5 adults had a celebration dinner. Gals were very happy with calamari. All had fish dinners. Fish was good but my bass was on a lentil base which was disgusting. Real clunker. Good salmon and swordfish.Our waiter looked and acted a bit like the actor who plays Harold on the Red Green show! Funny and friendly.,Art M

50,Spectacular!,My company participated in an event at Trump National Doral. I have never golfed at this Trump layout and was not disappointed. We played Red Tiger and loved every minute of it. The course was in excellent condition and the staff was very attentive and professional. The pro shop one of the best I have ever seen! So many choices.... Highly recommend the golf course and resort....,conley1234

40,"Say what we want about Trump, but this is a gorgeous location","We went in a somewhat joking mood to the Trump National Golf Course, but I do have to admit the scenery alone makes it worthwhile to at least walk around the grounds. I don't think I would go back and actually pay for anything, but it was a surprisingly fun pit stop.",PH2003
50,Nice Course in an incredible setting,"The course was interesting fair and impeccably maintained. The wind picked up in the afternoon and made several of the holes very challenging.The real story of the course is the incredible setting and views. This is a true oceanside course with great views of the Pacific and cliffs in every direction. Although this is not an inexpensive course to play, the greens fees are fairly reasonable considering the setting.The clubhouse and was nice if not spectacular with great views of the course and ocean. I would recommend this course to friends and would love to play there again when I am tuned up in mid season.",Dan L
40,Great happy hour and brunch,"We live locally and love to visit this ""gem"" of a spot. It won't disappoint. We have even seen the Donald himself there. Overall it's a great spot. We wish they hadn't closed the dog trails. That was such a cool feature. I'd say pay it a visit if you can. I don't know about the golf aspect but the guys say it's a challenging yet fun course.",morganblairanthony
50,"""Relaxing area with many trails to explore""",Palos Verdes is a very beautiful place to visit on warm sunny days. Trump National Golf Course is one of my favorites places to visit. The hiking trails are great for exercise and taking a view of the beautiful blue water and the surrounding area. We enjoy packing a picnic lunch with different beverages and enjoying the sun and temperature as we sit at picnic tables enjoying the view.,GUCCI415
20,Tricked up course not for serious golfers,"The course was beautifully manicured and the ocean views were spectacular. The course itself was merely spectacle. If you like a good challenge on a golf course you'll hate this layout. No choices, no risk/reward, little variation. Hole after hole featured deceptive sight lines, Hawaii Five-0 styled bunker complexes, and ridiculous, multi-tiered, undulating greens with miniature golf-like characteristics (i.e. you hit a good put and it rolls off the back of the green). This is a course at best to be viewed but certainly not to be played by the serious golfer.",Ted028
40,Not bad,"Very nice layout but it's right in the middle of a hiking trail system and the hikers seem to run the place walking across fairways and talking on the trails while you are trying to play. If you can't keep the ball in the fairway bring plenty of golfballs or play somewhere else since you are not allowed to search the ""nature preserve"" for your ball. Otherwise I do recommend the course and I would play it again if I ever visit the area again.",sepedigo
50,Great Golf Course - Scenic Pacific Ocean Views,We enjoyed our visit to Trump National Golf Course It is a top notch golf course.The views of the Pacific Ocean from the golf coure are stunningly beautiful.It is a public golf course.

40,Gorgeous views with some construction wrapping up,"Great challenging course and maximizes the ocean views at every turn. Some ongoing construction and errant hikers on the course. But overall, a great experience and beautiful scenery. Fantastic staff took great care of us, clubs, luggage throughout the day.Not sure if it's worth the rack rate $280 for the first few tee times, but probably a fair price at $180 - $160 range for the 10:00 am tee times and later.Lunch was delicious and clubhouse is traditional trump gaudy... I mean opulent .... (I actually mean gaudy)..d√©cor. Locker rooms are comfortable if you need to head to LAX after the round.",Dan A
50,AMAZING,"This golf course is in perfect condition and it offers great views of the ocean. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. You can't go wrong here. Even if you don't play golf, it's an experience just to visit the golf club and take in the views.",Starrlee316

30,Disappointed,"I have played Trump Bedminster (NJ) and Trump Aberdeen (Scotland). They are both magnificent golf venues. Aberdeen will be a Top 10 in the world if it isn't yet. So, my son's combo Fathers Day and Birthday gift of a round at Trump Los Angeles was met with great expectation. Unfortunately, even with allowance for the California drought the course was nowhere near top level standards. The greens were immaculate, the tee boxes chewed up with plenty of uneven lies. The fairways were OK. The layout is grand and so you can imagine a great golf experience. It needed more tending.",MickeyFaigen
40,Great Wedding Venue,"We were invited to a wedding that was held here. The wedding was held on the lawn outside the banquet room, high on a hill, with a beautiful view. The weather was perfect.Inside, the appetizers and drinks were great. The room for the reception was very elegant, with a large dance floor and band area in the middle. The staff, all dressed in black, with iPads, were very, very organized, cordial and professional. The meal was magnificent. My wife had the filet mignon and I had the sea bass, and they were cooked to perfection. They both came with nicely cooked vegetables. The salad was great too.This is a perfect place for a wedding and reception, although a bit far away. The wedding party and other events were in Santa Monica, probably an hour and a half away. We stayed in Manhattan Beach, which was still an hour away. We drove up highway one and the Palos Verdes Blvd to get there, instead of the highway. It give beautiful views, in spite of the dry vegetation resulting from drought and the smoggy view of the sea.",Mike P

30,Drought has really hurt the course,"A beautiful course but currently ravaged by drought. We played here once before and thought it was spectacular. It is still a good golf experience but the course is kind of a mess. A few holes are under construction and the fairways are getting killed.however, we received both phone calls and emails advising us of the construction before we arrived. Greens fees have been reduced to reflect what is going on, which was very fair.",susan r
50,Great views and hike,"We went there for the view and some hiking, there are some spectacular views of the coastline and easy access with free parking.",Viktor B
20,"Overpriced, overrated, subpar service","The spectacular ocean views go without saying but a course that charges close to $300 should also have the quality and service to match which it does not. The fairways were spotty, brown and dead in so many places for such an expensive course. I mentioned to a staff member at the end of the round when he asked me about my round to which he replied defensively ""We're in a drought!"". I was shocked by his response. Well then don't charge the rates that you do then! No deference to the customer but rather a smug attitude. Wish I got his name. I'd fired people like that on my staff. They'll destroy your business from the inside.",Hiker100
50,"Deeply discounted golf for Veterans, police and firemen","I will preface my brief review by saying first of all I am not a golfer but I do live close to the golf course and frequently walk the trails surrounding the course and enjoy eating at the restaurants. What I didn't know until yesterday was that they give Vets, police and fire personnel discounts for playing the course which is very generous. I am none of the above so hopefully these groups are aware of it. If not, hopefully they are now!",SandraAl
50,"Great views, demanding course","My wife and I had just enough time to play one course in the Los Angeles area and gave Trump National a shot. Just as we imagined, it is located on the Pacific Ocean and every hole has lovely views. It is not inexpensive to play, but price breaks throughout the day can make it more affordable. With California in a drought and water restrictions in place, the Trump iconic fountains were being removed during our visit. The fairways were tight and on most holes errant shots would end up in environmentally sensitive areas where retrieval was impossible. Check the slope rating numbers before you pick which tee box you are going to use. I normally like to play around 6,000 yards and most courses I play have a rating of ~130 to 133. The tee box I chose (blue) played out at 6291 yards. I did not notice the slope rating was 138. If I play again (and very well might) I will move up to the white tees at 5881 yards. The greens were challenging and added to the difficulty of the course.We did not have time to dine here but the facilities looked very nice.",Gary F
50,Free hiking trails,"We live nearby and wanted to go hiking. The views are stunning & the hike is along the golf course. There is a parking lot where you can park for free, there is a restroom & water fountain as well. It was very peaceful & safe... The view was just breathtaking!!!",Anna H
40,Interesting course with great ocean views,"I've played at least five Trump courses. This one was very nice with ocean views on almost everywhere on the course. It's tight for the average player with lots of waste areas. Unless you're a single-digit handicap, bring lots of balls. The track is pretty convoluted with lots of backtracking. You really have to pay attention to the signage. We paid the reduced after 2:00 rate of $160. I wouldn't pay more. Food in the restaurant was expensive, but average. The staff were all very helpful.",Jack T
50,Class and Finesse,"We attended the wedding of our daughters best friend. What a beautiful view, the food was served hot and it was plated beautifully. We had the choice of Salmon or Chicken Prosciutto, I had the Chicken and it was delicious. Served with Asparagus and a potato mash. the staff was professional and at the ready for any requests. The only downfall was that during the ceremony, the golfers could be heard speaking (and some of it was pretty tacky) thru the hedge that separates the venue from the Golf Clubhouse...other than that, it was beautiful",Susie M

40,decent course with great service.,I played this one on my stop before NZ and it was a great warm up. its a tough course with nice greens. not sure its worth the really high ranking it gets in golf magazine but the ocean views might have something to do with that. the wife did like all the birds there too.,Phil F
50,"Spectacular golf course, tight fairways, and tough greens.","Trump National was one of the most challenging courses I've ever played with its tight fairways, undulating greens, and tough pin placements.

20,Very disappointing return experience,"I played trump last Dec 2013 with my family. I was SO excited to return to one of the courses I rave about as having the best views in Socal as well as challenging holes to make for a great round of golf.The day started out exactly as I expected: warm greetings from the pro shop as we bought the extra balls we would need, a thorough explanation of the course from the starter and an amazing bloody mary from the beverage cart.We pre-ordered our cheesburgers at #9 for the turn... and that is when my day was absolutely ruined by poorly trained staff. At the turn, I went to the locker room to use the restroom. The locker room attendant was not there, so I asked Mary, the concession stand cashier, for the code.She asked me if I was playing golf. I smiled and said yes. She came out the side door of her concession stand into the hallway, looked me up and down and said ""Are you sure?"" I was in utter disbelief. Um.... (in my head thinking, do you see my golf shoes, my Nike golf skirt and golf ball silhouettes in my pocket?) ""Yes,"" I reiterated again. Mary, ""Ok this is the code."" I go back to the door, the code is wrong. I had to walk back down the hallway and said ""What is the code it didn't work?"" Instead of apologizing, she just rattled off another code. This code was completely different. It was not as if she had transposed the numbers, all 4 numbers were different!I was fuming. I wanted to ask, ""Excuse me, are you sure you work at Trump? Did I really just spend $1000 just to be here to golf to get this kind of humiliation and treatment?""I called the manager, Dimitrius, who was apologetic and assured me he would reprimand the employee. Upon the completion of my round, he offered me a complimentary drink.When we got the check, my drink was on the bill. I was even more embarrassed to have to tell the waiter the drink should be comp'd! I appreciate Dimitrius' gesture, but a $10 complimentary cocktail does not come close to making up for the humiliation and ruined day of golf. Dimitrius said he has not played the course, so maybe he does not realize how much it costs to step foot on the course. Most golf courses that charge $280 in greens fees per player would have offered a complimentary future round to ensure I kept a high regard for their club.My second experience really changed my view of the Trump golf course and what it offers. I would never want to risk spending $1,000 to be humiliated again nor could I recommend it to business associates for fear they could have the same experience.",Erica J
40,Quiet Place for Breakfast with Amazing Views,"The Cafe Pacific restaurant at Trump National in Rancho Palos Verdes is not very busy for breakfast, and that suits me just fine. You always get a nice window table with a great Pacific Ocean view. Service is fast, efficient, and friendly...and the food is good, too!This visit I had an omelet with cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and avocado. It comes with toast, hash browns and your choice of either bacon or sausage. I opted for the sourdough toast and bacon. The omelet was very good but a little dry. Everything else was excellent. I did not order coffee this time, as I feel their $5 price is a bit much for ""just OK"" coffee. Service from Mr. Kevin was excellent, as always.Parking here is free, both self and valet. But if you elect to use valet parking, please remember to tip the valet well for their very fast service.I hit a golf ball once. It was not a pleasant experience. But that's another story!",ChiefDennis

50,Not just a golf course,"This is open to the public and there are several trails that lead down to the beach and along the cliffs. It used to be dog friendly, but dogs are no longer allowed on the beach (due to a handful of residents who protested and won), however they are allowed all along the trails (on leashes). The beach is not a great swimming beach as there are many large rocks. The beach itself is a mixture of sand and small rocks. At Trump itself, there is a very nice grass area with picnic tables scattered about to enjoy the view of Catalina and the ocean. Beautiful sunsets too. The dining room is a nice place to stop in for a drink and/or lunch and dinner. Overall it has something to offer most anyone: hiking, strolling, tide pool exploration (at low tide), or just chilling. I could only ""select"" one of the below, but this is great for all: couples, families with all ages of children, friends, business, and solo. And I could only select one date that I visited, but it is appropriate year-round and I go often.",Barbara H
50,Good hamburgers and awesome view,"The location is amazing. We don't golf but we love going there to hike and to have lunch at the outside patio where they serve hamburgers and hot dogs. Not too expensive and there are few places with a view like this one, you can see Catalina Island from tip to tip. We have seeing whales right from the deck while having lunch.",LisleyD
40,"beautiful views all day long, lacking in customer service","When we arrived the course was shrouded in fog. Looking out at the ocean was like looking at clouds from a plane. It burned off quickly to offer spectacular ocean views with Catalina Island in the distance. All holes are on the ocean, and there is nothing but great views all day long.The course was in great condition, and we really enjoyed our day there for the most part.When we arrived at the bag drop, the young man took my bag our of the trunk and dropped it on the ground. He picked it up and stood it up. Then he took my husband's bag out and proceeded to drop his bag too!When we went inside to pay(a lot), the young man from the bag drop came in to let us know that he had broken one of the legs on my bag, and it would no longer stand. There was no offer to repair or replace. The bathroom on the main level of the palatial clubhouse was found to be in need of cleaning. I understand that the management cannot be responsible for what other people do in a toilet stall, but they can be responsible for checking it frequently.I found the same thing when I used to on course restroom. Not only was it dirty, but the toilet seat was beat up and stained. There is no reason for not maintaining a high standard for the restrooms at such an expensive place.When I went inside to use the lower level restrooms at the turn, there was a keypad lock on the door. I walked back to a desk on the way and asked the man there what the code was, and he laughed and told me that that bathroom was just for players. already disgusted with the restroom situation there, I started to tell him that I was a player. He got up and unlocked the door for me, but did not give me the code. At least that restroom was clean.",2ritravelers
50,Great again!,"Second time playing this course in just over a month.For us NV/AZ people it is an ocean experience.You really can't beat the views.The course played a little slower than last time & the Marshall wasn't as vigilant.Overall it's a beautiful course & I'd want to play it every time I'm in the area.Difficult, scenic & fun- can't beat that.",VicandFawn
50,"Great staff, course... Challenging winds","Stopped in for one final round on my Southern California swing, and thankful I chose here. Courses like this can be a little intimidating, but the staff was super friendly and helpful. Played the twilight round, and because the tee was open, they let me start early. If not for this, wouldn't have finished all 18.The course was tight. You've got to be in control off the tees, which is tough given the wind coming off the water. The course was in really good shape. Most of the greens putt true, but a couple had been well traveled and needed a new hole location.It's not in the shape of some of the really nice courses down the coast, but the late afternoon value rounds make it a must-play.",Eric W
40,What a difficult course!,My husband and I golfed here twice last week. The slope rating for women was the highest I have ever played on. There was never a level place. Most holes were similar but the beauty of the ocean was spectacular. The employees were very accommodating and friendly.,Shooties
50,18 holes of Ocean!,I'm really surprised it's not ranked higher. Every single hole has an ocean view.The valet was friendly & efficient. The golf shop was nice & staff was friendly.The starter came by & checked on us a few times.The course is beyond scenic.Although a lot of the holes are similar it's still amazing as a whole. Maybe the tee boxes are a little beat up but that's really getting picky.It's a beautiful course with great staff. I can't wait to take more clients there.,VicandFawn
20,"Great views, course is difficult, and not well groomed","Trump National is well worth the $280 for the views, but as golf course if was not a fun thing to do. Bring plenty of golf balls because the natural areas laid out between parallel fairways are off limits (I would go in them anyway). All of the fairways seem to be parallel. Contrived man made water falls gave it a Disney or put putt feel. Staff was great, club house was Trumpesque. (beautiful and a little ""over the top""). I have been fortunate to play Trump National Bedminister and it was a real golf course.",Ken C
10,Total Disappointment,"This was the greatest disappointment I have ever had at a golf course. It is scenic - beautiful views of ocean. Condition was good but not great. And the waterfalls were fun. And that is where the positive ends. Pete dye outdoes himself with one of the most ludicrous examples of golf ever. Playing the blues at about 6200 for par 71. Almost every hole has the most absurdly narrow landing space from 220-260yds. Ridiculous. Blind shots. Never a flat lie. Plays incredibly long on multiple holes. Never a straightforward hole. Designed for the low digit single handicapper (I'm a 9.5 and was constantly in trouble). For that rack rate price of close to $300, go down the road to pelican hill/Torrey/monarch beach/sandpiper/ multiple other locations with better designs at significantly less cost. Would never play there again or ever recommend it to anyone.",desertduffergolf
50,Under the Radar,"Trump National is not receiving enough publicity. It is one of the most scenic courses you can play. It is certainly up there with Whistling Straights, Pacific Dunes and The Ocean Course at Kiawah. The Pacific is in view on every hole. The first hole's waterfall is incredible. The course is in great condition. It is a fair but challenging. You do not want to miss many fairways. The staff is professional and courteous. The senior starter is a great person to talk with and a superior employee.",Tom E

The lunch is excellent as well. At a fraction of the price of dinner you can enjoy a delicious lunch overlooking the Pacific. It's a great place for a special occasion or to enjoy a lovely, leisurely lunch.",Dawn W
40,Beautiful course in pristine area,I decided to play Trump National in November during the re-seeding of the greens period. The green fees are half price at that time. I am not cheap but I also dont like paying more than 100 dollars for a round of golf. I feel there are plenty of nice courses in the United States that charge under 100 dollars. To say I have played Trump National was worth the 150 dollar green fee however. Trump is located on the coast of California about 15 miles west of Los Angeles in an upscale community known as Palos Verdes. We played the course on a weekday and it was not crowded. The first tee really sets the tone for the round. It is a beautiful hole with a grand waterfall near the green. Most of the holes on this course have ocean views. It is not a course for someone that has just started playing golf. I have been playing for 20 years and I can hit the ball straight and I still found this layout to be very challenging. Five holes in I decided that I would put my driver away. I played the rest of the round with a 4 iron off the tees. This allowed me to stay in the fairways and still hit my ball into the fairway about 200 yards. The greens were being reseeded so each putt was a bumpy ride to say the least. This didnt matter. I was happy to be there with my son and we had a great time. I will definitely be back.,Gene2459
50,Must Play Golf Course,"Wow. What a golf course! I felt like a country club member for the day. The course is very challenging, so bring your A game. Photo opportunities on every hole. I'll be back, sooner rather than later.",John W
50,Beautiful Hike,"We didn't go to golf but the trail passes through the golf course so I can definitely say the course is beautiful with great views of the ocean.We actually went to hike the ocean trails which are stunning! There are a lot of different trails with different levels of difficulty once you start walking. We chose the trail that led down to the beach. Great going down but steep when your coming back up. Definitely a good workout. From the top, the views of the pacific are amazing and seem to go on forever. There's free parking on La Rotunda Drive and a free clean bathroom at the entrance. I forgot to mention that the trails are not at all crowded. Definitely recommend checking it out.",310dini
50,Worth the experience‚Äîonce,"The course is extremely challenging, but so beautiful that you almost forget how hard it is. I loved how almost every hole had an ocean view, but I'm not sure this is a course I would play again unless it's a special occasion. The staff were very friendly and the facilities top-notch.",Lauren K
50,Awesome course,"We played here last Sunday March 30. We had a foursome and were blessed with great weather. I'm very impress with the service and the ambiance of the location; expecting nothing but the best from TRUMP. The Staff were friendly and courteous. We were given lockers when we arrived, our clubs were loaded up to our carts. We were also given courtesy range balls prior to our tee time of 8am. You must come early with plenty time to soak up the place before playing your round here. The course was fantastic except, the greens were being aeroficated and was difficult to putt. But they did give me a discount to play again. Overall with every hole with a view of the Pacific Ocean, the experience was priceless regardless of the green fee. All of us were flabbergasted just playing the course. Although, make sure you bring plenty of balls because once you hit the ball OB on either side, you might as well forget it. The pace of play was great, 10min lag between groups which my group liked. No worries, just swing away. Lastly, I will be back. I would highly recommend this course even for just the experience. Late!",smoothjazz
50,Stop to see the views and walk the trails,"We are not golfers but stopped here as we were driving the coast from LA Harbor to Hermosa Beach to see the coastal views. We just stopped for less than an hour and didn't realize the vast amounts of trails that weave thru the course, along the bluffs and down to the beach. Looks like The Donald had to leave a lot of public access and natural settings in tact to build golf course! It was all well done and worth a visit.",ItchyFeet
50,Phenomenal!,"This was my first ""Trump"" golf experience and it was out of this world. The course is in meticulous shape, rolling fairways, tough greens and amazing views. Playing from the reds we did not find it to be a hard course at all. The greens were definitely challenging and no matter the read play towards the ocean!! I have personally never played Pebble but my friend has and says ""dollar for dollar, just as good as Pebble"" The down side is that there is public walking trails and a park so they use our restrooms and you have to watch out not to hit them on certain holes. One thing I have never seen is a non golfer sitting on the 13th green tossing tennis balls to his two terriers in to the sand traps!! I asked him if he planned on raking up and he gave me the bird.I definitely recommend for anyone visiting the area and loves scenic golf to play Trump National.",Pamela P
50,Ocean view from every tee box!,"Gorgeous golf course with some tough lies due to the course being on the side of an oceanside mountain.

Worth playing at least once if you an avid golfer. Great service overall.",Pavan V
50,Go here for the Trails!,"We are not golfers, but thankfully there are miles of coastal trails interspersed amongst the golf course. We accidentally found this gem and could only spend an hour here. We could have easily spent a few hours walking down to the beaches and just exploring. Free parking and restrooms at the trailhead. What a great place.",shastaball
30,Snobby and Expensive,"To be frank, I am not the best person to rate this locale. Mr. Trump is not necessarily popular with the locals because he is....well, Trump. Lots of money and crassness, no substance. Of course the location is gorgeous and the restaurant sumptuous. But obviously, one pays a premium price for the golf course and the restaurant. I don't know about the golf course, but the restaurant has beautiful murals and a great view of the coast. The food is good, but not fabulous. Bring a camera to take pictures of the coast. Mr. Trump has generously (snicker) opened the grounds for the public to visit.",Bgoodtoall

Driving range was on side of hill and not level,,,,,very odd.Tee boxes and greens were in great shape, but the fairways and rough are in very poor condition......mix of grasses, no grass in some areas, torn up in others......stop putting the money into the waterfalls, and into a little grass seed ! Most 75.00 a round public courses are in better shape. I can't begin to tell you how disappointed we were in the round.In addition, our GPS system on the cart did not work and it took the 90 minutes to come out and replace the cart......we called them 3 times to come out and swap carts.........for 350.00 they should have been out there immediately. Poor service in my book.Don't waste your money.",paul30
40,Great Golf,Had a great time at the Trump National Golf Club with a group of friends. Beautiful setting and the course was in good shape. The clubhouse is beautiful with a nice bar and restaurant where we had lunch.,SEL1006
40,"Gorgeous, tough, expensive, first class service","Very difficult course and I'm a 9. Hit it off the fairway and its gone in wild area. Greens very, very fast and firm. Fog was in for the first 10 holes so we didn't see the ocean until the 11th, we teed off at 8:10. Rack rate is very expensive; my cousin went in and greased the pro shop the night before and got a coupon for everyone in our foursome for $150 each. Terrific, terrific starter in Manny!!!!!!! Would like to play again after knowing it. Great views!! A few longer carries to the fairway. We played it at 6400 yards. Ball doesn't fly as far there as it does in Minnesota. Pricey and it was busy.",pbirdie3
10,The friendly is not forthcoming or friendly,"Staff not friendly at all when they know you are a guest of Terranea. They did not treat us good at all. We were very disappointed.....Terranea recommended Trumps, Sad that .The food was not worth what they charge. I love food, being Italian and all. I was very disappointed. Stay and play a round at Terranea much better service! I think my husband was almost embarrassed bringing friends here to Trumps. NEVER AGAIN!",Anna U
50,Great Golf,"and the views can't be matched, tuff golf so due to windy conditions, location right at the ocean. Patio has 19th hole food with ocean views. Call the starter for special golf rates through out the year. MeuterMedia",MeuterMedia
50,For non golfers the food is great.....,We do not play golf but have enjoyed many wonderful luncheons and a great many outstanding dinners. We have been fortunate to have hosted a number of special occasions at the club. The view alone is a memorable sight. The service has alway been excellent. Pat.F.,falangettisurf
50,Got married here!,Trump National is a beautiful place to go. I actually got married here in 2009 and had the most wonderful wedding ever. The food here is delicious and not over priced like you might expect. They also have really nice public walking trails that are dog friendly.,Angela A
40,"Golf Course is Tough, Hiking Trails are Great and Restuarant is Excellent","If you are a golfer this course is extremely tough; however, the views on the back side are magnificent and the course is nicely manicured. Pricey green fees, but hey, if you are on vacation play it once and bring lots of golf balls as most of the off course flora is ""ecologically protected"" so you cannot go in to look for balls. The hiking trails in and around Trump are great and have beautiful views and you can be adventurous and hike down to the ocean and tide pools. The views from the upper trails are great. Trump has provided picnic tables etc. for the non golfers and that area is open to the public so you can take your own lunch and eat at your leisure with a breathtaking view of the Pacific Ocean and the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Also a great place to walk your dog if you feel so inclined. Trump has a very good restaurant in the clubhouse that has a very European ambiance. The food is a bit pricey; however, the ambiance and the service are super. The food in the sandwich grill is also very good. I suggest you give it a try.",rjgagliano
50,Sunday brunch yummy,I don't golf. Beautiful place to walk around .Sunday brunch is expensive ( Donald trump) but oh so good. Crowded need reservations.,Kathy F
40,"Went for the hiking trail, not the golf","Nice trail along cliffs and down to the beach- bit of local flora and fauna, then the Pacific rocky sections and sand beach - you can go a fair ways (pun intended) north 'til you run into a private club section. There's a southern section we didn't try. And you can have lunch at the club afterwards (public welcome). We took our own picnic, so I can't vouch for the food there.The top part of the trail includes a walk along the cliff top and edge of the golf course that is wheelchair accessible (though not perfectly flat). And there are a number of other hikes along the coast north and south within a short distance - check the following websited for dtails on this hike: http://www.everytrail.com/guide/ocean-scenic-trails-at-trump-golf-clubhouse",Donquixote218
50,Golf on the Pacific; What's Not to Love?,"Have now played to Trump four times. This is a magnificently manicured facility all the way around. Tough track, and tougher the farther back you go. Awesome to be able to play right on the Pacific ocean, with clear views of Catalina, and not be a member somewhere. It's not cheap, but worth every red cent.Also, of note, the restaurant onsite has outstanding food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.Highly recommended.",Jim C
50,Go for the beach that sits below the bluff,There is a park adjacent to the gold course. Park up top and hike the trails down to Rancho Palos Verdes Beach. It sits below the course. Low tides are amazing here as there are tide pools galore. Take a picnic and eat at one of the picnic tables on the bluff-beautiful view.,Lukeoline
40,nice view from the restaurant,"The restaurant has a reasonable pricing policy, and an old world feel to it. The view is very nice and it is a rather quiet place, you can talk. The food is good without being exceptional. I only tried it at lunch time to be able to see the ocean.",pourpre
40,Awesome views - tough golf,"The day we played was beautiful and the scenery matched - from the surfside views to the whales playing off the coast. The course is in great shape, greens rolled true. Our group found the back nine tougher than the front, maybe a little tricked up on a couple of holes. Service was excellent though and we had a great time. Take your camera.",jlfor
50,Beautiful,Beautiful golf course on the edge of the Ocean. Love it! My group all said what a great course this was. Challenging and fun.,Vickiedga
40,Trump...overpriced ...not memorable,What makes the course nice is where it is located....however the actual course design itself is not very memorable. The only holes I remember are those that had the waterfalls. Would I go there again....probably not for the money. Orange Co. has many nice courses for half the price! The course is very well maintained but I guess you should expect that for the price!,RP507
40,"Can't Afford to Play Golf, then have Lunch","After visiting the Wayfarer Chapel, We stopped at the Trump Golf Course. First, parking is free in the public lot or if going to eat, parking is free in Trump's lot. The restaurant was very nice and prices were 'fair' for the ambiance the dining room offered. We chose to eat outside at the tables with umbrellas. This was the lunch stop before going to the 10th hole. You order at the window and they call you when it is ready. Limited items, but my teriyaki and pineapple hamburger was very good and came with chips and a drink. The view was really nice. There are also tables for picnics and trails to walk. Really a very pretty place to visit.",hoho92649
40,Beautiful course,Purely from an aesthetic standpoint Trump National is hard to beat. The beauty rivals any track i've played. It is breathtaking.The course is really tough if you can't hit it straight. If you hit it out if the fairway you will likely not find your ball. If you do find the ball you will likely have an unplayable lie.Here are my only two issues;1) there are beautiful white sand bunkers...but they were really hard...like hitting off cement. They need to fluff them up more2) lots of people didn't seem too worried about repairing their ball marks on the green...which was too bad as the greens were pretty niceAll in all though...beautiful track and great golf experience...we played after 1PM and it only cost $160...(better than the $280-$290 before 1PM,GregH106
50,Awesome if you have the bucks,"Probably one of the best courses in California. Green's fees are painful; so find someone to treat you! The service is perfect, the course perfect, the views amazing. It's a young course, so as the trees grow and mature it's only going to get better. The staff is really attentive, and the golf instructors are really great.",Mike90275
30,Overpriced golf in a beautiful setting.,"This course started out as Ocean Trails. Right on the coast on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Spectacular views and we liked the course. After Trump took over when a couple of holes slid down the cliff, it was extensively remodeled. If you hit out of the fairway into the ""environmentally sensitive areas"" they get quite out of joint if you go after your ball. It is a difficult course and everything is really expensive. You are paying for the Trump name, and what you get is not worth what you pay.",dinla
30,Overpriced,"The golf course itself is challenging in that there are protected environmental areas where you cannot go into and if you have a slice or a hook, you are going to lose a lot of balls. This makes the game quite challenging and only a course for straight and long hitters. Some drives need to be hit almost 200 yards through the wind until they hit the fairway. Trump really should just be for low handicap golfers. Some fairways have rolling hills and even if you land in the miiddle of the fairway, your ball can end up in the first cut. The rough itself is very thick, course grass that is hard to get out of. The greens are surrounded by huge bunkers. One green is an island green that is not surrounded by water, but surrounded by sand. There are some holes that are challenging due to water hazards. The course is empty most of the time and can be played in as little as 3 and 1/2 hours in a twosome. It can get quite foggy at the course and quite windy, depending on the day that you are there. At a price tag of well over $200, the course becomes more expensive than Pebble Beach in N. California and Torrey Pines in S. California. If you are a good golfer and you hit the course on a sunny, calm day, you will have a wonderful day of golf. If your handicap is 15 or higher, you may lose a lot of golf balls and struggle on the course.",Chris S
50,Fancy dinner,Our dinner was delicious and the service was excellent! We went early so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves.,teachlove21
30,Lunch,Went to have lunch there the day after Thanksgiving and my choice for lunch was not good. They did not charge me for it but the prices there are too high for errors. They also only had 3 Trump Towers left for desert and 4 of us had ordered them. So I was disappointed again. It is too expensive to not do a really superb job!,MammaGrace
10,Not worth the expense,What a waste of time. There are many better places in Southern California to play. Can not figure what justifies the expense.,Van L
50,One of my favorite 19th holes,"I love to hang out at the bar/restaurant here. Wonderful service, atmosphere, food, drinks. And awesome views. This time I went golfing with my husband. I'm a 38 handicapper and he's a 7. That course kicked our butts. Granted it's hard for my husband to maintain much of a competitive game when he's out with me, but you have to keep them straight on this course. There's trouble everywhere. The layout is great because each hole feels like your own as you play. It's rare to see other players. But the privacy that you get from the terracing and the landscaping eats any wayward balls. I quit even trying to look for balls if I missed the fairway. The course had just been seeded so it was cart path only so I'm pretty sure I walked more that way than if I had just straight up walked the course. The fairways were still healing so there were a lot of bad lies to deal with, but the greens were pretty good. They gave us a discount because of the condition and a return voucher for the same price good through March 2013. I told my husband to bring his more competitive friends back there. I'll meet him in the bar.",dvsdeedee
30,Overpromised disappointment,"Played the course 27th September 2012 as part of our epic golfing road-trip from San Francisco to San Diego which took in three US Open courses and other gems along the way. Our straight up disappointment on the trip was our afternoon at Trump National.With careful pre-planning we had the first twilight time @ 1-30pm reducing the cost to a mere $150 per man to play as opposed to a full rate of $285. The staff were pleasant, courteous and helpful and everything was fine until we got on the course. Read their website, you are in for a spectacular course with spectacular views, rumoured as the most expensive course ever built in the US.Reality is in my view a little different. Views are as advertised, stunning, but we found the course condition the worst we have experienced through our many US trips. tee boxes were overgrown and needed cut, fairways were littered with unreplaced divots and the signage between holes was truly inadequate. It's not like the course was busy as we saw only half a dozen groups whilst we played. There was considerable emphasis on the waterfall feature behind the first hole as being the start of your magical experience but we were already debating our selection on the grounds of simple queries regarding basic conditioning, 18 holes later our view had not changed. By comparison to other options this is overpriced and overpromised, not in our view for real golfers wanting a real golfing experience.Not a complete disaster but not a recommended option.",martin_mcdowell
50,Great short hiking scenic spot!,"I am not a golfer, however, eating, hiking, and viewing the stunning scenery is one of the top enjoyment! You can hike next to the beautiful Pacific Ocean.",Susan R
50,Best view - best wine list,If you want a romantic dinner out this place is great! Even a lunch. Brunch is to die for. Thomas is the sommelier and he is the reason we keep coming here. He is the best! If you want to try some new wines - need help with your french - just ask,shakagrrl
50,"Very hard, very beautiful","The course is gorgeous with views of the ocean on almost every hole. It is expensive, but not bad after 230. It is very difficult. Any ball hit left, right. long and sometimes even short may be lost.",Tennispeople
30,Expensive and overpriced and you are a second class citizen,Its a pity that such a demanding course wants your cash but doesn't really make you feel at ease with the facilities....Its Trump this and Trump ..... the name is supposed to provide you with excellence and it doesn't ....It may as a member ..it does but as a non member the facilities are better at so many other courses.The Golf course is tough and no good if you play to a handicap over 10....the views of the sea is great....not spectular...just great .Its just too expensive for what it is...resting on a name not a facility.Ever where else they charge inc tax....here they charge plus Tax.Save up pay Pebble beach....its a better and world apart from this ego trip.....or play Pelican Hill.A OK day out but not great as it should be.,Readytoburst

40,Beautiful course.,"The course is very well maintained, the bunkers, greens and fairways were immaculate. And the views are amazing on the tee boxes.Only a couple negatives. 1. Not really on the ocean like other ocean front courses. 2. The holes themselves are not that memorable they all kind of run together, still tough if you miss the fairway though.Biggest positive was the service I received, especially from the starter Manny. He made me feel comfortable from the start. I'll probably pay again just because of that.",dipnice
20,The most ball hungry course I have ever played.,"The course is just ""unfair"". The views are great, but the layout isn't fun to play unless you are a PGA pro. Even then I'd question the ability to stay on the fairways.",Russelldevans
50,Tight and long but well worth it.,We had a blast. This place is extreme golf especially for a high handi-capper. Beautiful course overlooking the Pacific. Bring lots of balls. :),Spicewood007
10,Be sure to know your insurance deductible,"Without doubt, an amazingly gorgeous site and the restaurant and coastal access provides other reasons besides golfing to visit. Tips for visitors: 1) Your parked car can get hit by a golf ball and the Trump staff will not provide meaningful assistance 2) Make sure your cell phone has coverage and is charged up.In our case, a golfer popped his head through the bushes looking for his ball (singular, apparently). Then he quickly dashed off for his next hole when he learned the car windshield had been smashed by a ball. Security took an hour to appear and, clearly, the golfing clientele cannot always be relied upon to do the right thing. Had the ball hit a person or a pet, you'll need the cell phone to be sure to get real professionals involved.",irenem k
50,Great round at a beautiful course.,I really enjoyed my round at Trump National Los Angeles. The staff were terrific. The course is in great shape. I believe that you can see the ocean on every hole. There is a park that is located within the course. I have played many great courses. Trump National is as good an any I have played.,gary7777
40,"Go for the golf, stay for the view - or vice versa...","We've enjoyed the restaurant at Trump National several times now, the latest two weeks ago for brunch. The lobby has newspapers, which one can take to the table for leisurely perusal over oj and eggs. We find the atmosphere welcoming - not in any way ""snobbish"" - and the ""big water"" views out toward ""Japan"" are stunning. There is plenty of parking. Use the valet if you wish, or not. A landscaped public walking path winds down toward the water where a monument tells the story of the Japanese-American farmer who used to till the soil in this location. We have not played golf here yet, but that is next. The only negative I found is that the restaurant did not have orange marmalade - strawberry jam was the sole brunch offering - a shocking lack of choice which cannot be intentional. I must call the oversight to Mr. Trump's attention by letter. This is a reliable, scenic destination for special occasions or just for pleasure.",PatricksMom

Unfortunately, when we arrived we were seated at a long rectangular table that made conversation very difficult. We got some lame excuse as to why the table we had reserved was not available.",Vincenzo S
30,"Fantastic beach and park, but the stuff Trump runs is not so great","my rating is not about the golf course, which is pretty, but about the club itself. I used to eat here more often, but the food quality was inconsistent, and the prices seem to go up and up. Great views, but you can't really eat outside, except just outside the bar, where people sometimes smoke. The best part of this place is actually the city park next to it, which Trump does NOT run, and the wonderful trails, and the beach below it, all of which I would give five stars. Trump does seem to do a good job with weddings, and has gorgeous areas for that.",jbmc

50,Trump National Golf Club,"It is an incredible Golf Club, first rate. Target golf with views of the ocean on every hole. I love this course!",RonaldNDoe
40,Beautiful Views,"Trump National Golf Course offers some spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and dangling cliffs, however, the views can often be hampered by foggy days and cold weather. The course is challenging, as the rough is quite thick and if you go past the rough, your ball goes into an environmentally protected area that you are not allowed to walk on; hence, you have to hit the ball long and straight for this golf course. If you are not a 10 handicap or less, you probably won't enjoy your day and you might end up losing around 30 balls. The carts have GPS, so you know your position at all times, as well as the position of the carts ahead of you. There are several spectacular waterfalls. The course is quite pricey, up there with Pebble Beach prices, but you can get better deals during twilight hours. If you're a good golfer and you have the money, Trump is a nice golf course to give a try.",cds9989
50,The Cafe Pacific was Outstanding,"I was more than pleasantly surprised that such a great restaurant existed at the golf club.From the time we were seated until the time we left, we experienced excellent service and a superb meal.The waiter suggested to have various appetizers on a platter which we did and they were awesome. I ordered lamb and the chops were cooked perfectly and they were huge. I am a lamb fan and these were perfect. Another business associate had them as well and thought they were great as well.The wine list is extensive and they have wines from all over the world. I chose a wine from St. Julien (France) which he decanted and was just beautiful.For dessert I opted for some homemade ice cream that was great.All in all the 4 business associates were all very happy with the restaurant and I would highly recommend the place to anyone. By the way, the room is beautiful and warm and has a great view of the Pacific.",billkhoe
40,"Trump National LA -- magnificent setting, silly added features","Trump National Los Angeles, which rather proudly boasts that it is the most expensive golf course ever built, is set on one of the most scenic spots any of us will ever see in the form of a golf course. You can see the ocean from every hole. The fairways are narrow, and the rough only extends for a few more yards before the brush begins, which is completely unplayable, so bring your most accurate game, if not necessarily your longest one. Unless you're a single-digit handicapper, swallow your pride and play form the whites rather than the blues. The added waterfalls are just ridiculous Trump vanities, rather like nineteenth-century ""follies."" Ignore them, and instead embrace the site and its views. The clubhouse is impressive, which is its clear intention, and the service is first-rate. The eighteenth hole is a trip. Visit the black tee just for the fun of it, and hit a tee shot from there if you're not holding up the group behind you.",ColinHanna
40,"Exceptional Food, Service, and View","Have eaten at Trump's restaurant several times and it has always been a great experience. The service by everyone is superb, and the food excellent.

30,Brunch at Cafe Pacific,"Had Sunday brunch at Cafe Pacific which is the restaurant at the Trump national golf club. Positives - the brunch spread was great, everything you'd expect at a fancy champagne brunch buffet - made to order omlettes, pasta, carving stations, salads, sushi, etc. Views very nice and overlooking golf course. Negatives - First, its quite pricey, $75 per person. You can get similar quality brunches around town for $30-40 per person, even at places with nice (but not as breathtaking) views. Second, the room where the buffet itself is located is too small - when its crowded it can feel claustrophobic. Third, the interior of the restaurant is very nice and classy but it seemed much nicer downstairs with more consistent views - upstairs where we were seated it was a little more plain and the views not very good from some tables. Bottom line, for the money you can do better and if you want the view, take a drive around the Palos Verdes peninsular, even right by this place, and you'll do just as well.",MachThree
20,Stay home for the holidays!,"We live in Rancho Palos Verdes and used to frequent Trump National for their wonderful restaurant and bar all of the time. Everything is usually exceptional for Sunday Brunch, lunch, dinner, or just cocktails...great view, food, and service, but beware the Holiday buffets! My Mom and I decided to break tradition and eat out for Thanksgiving, and given the always elegant meals we have had at Trump we just assumed the Thanksgiving Brunch would be filled with visions of steaming fresh carved Turkeys, Holiday decorations, and live holiday music of the kind that only Trump could muster up! Upon arriving to the usual valet area we were told that we would need to pull around to the back, as the holiday brunch was being served in the ballroom...bad sign #1. Entering the ballroom area it was quickly obvious that the holiday brunch was about packing in as many people as they could at $75 a head, and not about the usual, intimate brunch experience that they normally serve. Cheap banquet tables were setup everywhere they could fit them, and you could almost hear the sound of the cattle herding in the ""buffet line"" as we were being walked to our table...thank goodness we were actually seated in the actual normal dining room or we would have left immediately. Making the best of it we decide to hit the buffet line, and that's what it was, a buffet line...honestly, I think we could have done better at Hometown Buffet, or on a football field maybe, as everyone was pushing and shoving to get to their goal. I immediately begin to search out the ""Thanksgiving food""...Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes. Well, I found the turkey at the carving station...not a turkey mind you, but just the standard ol' turkey you would find at any carving station, and it was right next to the very boring ham...the roast beef was taking a holiday obviously as well. As we went to grab plates to begin our venture none were to be found...anywhere! People were standing around with glazed over eyes wondering if we were possibly supposed to just pick off of the very plain buffet style steam trays that contained all of the rather dry, unappealing offering of the day. Eventually six plates arrived, and I hurdled the crowd to get two of them. Looking around I opted for some salad and some fresh frozen seafood, but after that everything looked so bad we simply gave up and left...but of course before leaving I just had to say something about our dismay, and that is another story all together that one would not expect from anything with ""The Donald's"" name on it. Bottom line, enjoy Trump National just about any other time, but stay home for the holidays!",vmacchia
20,Expensive driving range,"My son and I used the driving range. That cost $54 plus tax. We were told in the pro shop that as part of the package that we could use the chipping green. The range attendant indicated that the chipping area is designated ""lessons only"". At the range, tees were not available and the grass was worn down to dirt for the most part. $54 seemed like quite a bit of money to pay for the experience.",Eagle2826
30,Play during Twilight - Course not worth regular price,"Played here during labor day weekend 2009. We played in the afternoon, so we only had to pay $175 versus ~300 or 400 if you played in the morning. Pace of play was not a problem. Course was in very good condition. But I don't believe the course was spectacular enough to justify anyone paying regular price. But if you play twilight, you get better value. If you want a good course worth $300, I recommend Pelican Hill in Newport Beach. The course seemed really bunched together. It was not very hard to hit your ball into another fairway. There were a good mix of ocean side holes and non-ocean side holes.Golf carts are really cool as they have car-like seats with headlights and brake lights. Forecaddies are not required. This course is recommended for low handicap golfers only. The rough is a very thick grass, making it impossible to find your balls off the fairway. If you're not a scratch golfer, bring some extra balls.",Carmen1318
10,No compassion part 2,"I too had the pleasure to be in this wedding party. I could not believe the actions of this security guard. Never had I seen a more insensitive human being.

10,No Compassion,"I did not eat hear, I did not play golf here, I was in a wedding hear. This event made me so irate that I had to write a review about it. I was one of 14 groomsmen in a 2:00 wedding. The wedding was right on the course overlooking Catalina. Hot Afternoon! All in Tuxedos. So as everyone was being seated the grooms side all huddled in one ten foot shadow of shade. The security guard made it a point to swoop down the hill in his little golf cart and advise us this was a golf course and we would be hit by stray balls. Being that it's $350 a round we had not seen a single person playing the entire day. This shade which all of us were huddled into keep cool while we waited for the bride to get ready was behind 15 foot + bushes too. OK? so where do we stand? ""over there"" he said, as he pointed to a spot in the sun only 10 feet away from the shade we were standing in!? As we all shuffled by he only stared at each of including the groom, who kept his cool. Once we had moved into the sun he turned around and returned to his perch on the hill and stare at us. The wedding was absolutely gorgeous. I could not think of a better spot. But it was because of this one security guard I am writing this review. It was sad what an ego trip this man was on. If you work for Trump National and are reading this I would be willing to bet that you know who he is. I understand keeping trespassers off the course, but to have the nerve to treat a wedding party in such a disrespectful manner only minutes before the wedding, after god knows how much money that had already spent to have this venue. I firmly believe that this man did this purely out of selfish ego satisfaction, and not for the concern of our safety.

Even though it would add on an extra 20-30 minute commute to where ever you had to drive, it might be worth it for the beautiful calm scenery of those amazing ocean views.We arrived at the beautiful property and did an easy self park. It was the first time I had ever been inside a Trump property, and it was very nice. The chandeliers were gorgeous and the dining room was stately yet inviting and relaxing with an old world feel. We had reservations and were seated by a window which overlooks the golf course and the ocean so we saw golfers finishing up and also local residents walking or jogging in the distance on a nice trail.Our waiter Ryan was very efficient and patient and told us the history of the place when we asked. Two of us ordered the Lobster Bisque which was very unique and almost had a smoky flavor. We both agreed that it was very good, but surprisingly too salty. Still, as a person who LOVES Lobster Bisque, I ate it all trying to ignore the overly generous portion of salt. Because of all the salt, I decided to have a salad for dinner as I was feeling too dry and the salad was really creative with slices of oranges hearts of palm and candied pecans (I think) in a mustard vinaigrette. I was pleased. My husband ordered the Blue cheese/iceberg lettuce wedge to start which was very crisp and fresh and then both men ordered the Osso Bucco. These men have traveled all over the world and have very discriminating taste, and they said that although it had a little too much salt for their taste, it was extremely tender and one of the best Osso Buccos they had ever had.We brought our own wine because my husband has a small collection. The corkage was $25, which is in the ballpark for a restaurant like this. If he had not brought the 1996 French wine with him and bought something like it there, it would probably have cost $500+, so $25 for corkage is a bargain. That's another thing, the wine on their list isn't very old and is REALLY expensive. Not very good wines start at $80, which kind of takes advantage of people who don't know anything about wine. Appetizers were $13 or for a salad, my soup was only $8, and entrees start at $21 for Fettuccini and then most were in the area of $30-50.It was a lovely, lovely place. If they get the salt portion under control, it will be better. The calmness and European feel of the place and that view was worth every penny.Again, to recap, we brought our own wine and I had another appetizer instead of an entree, and we did not have coffee or desert, and for 3 people, it was $138 plus tip. For a full dinner - appetizer, entree, wine, desert, coffee, it could easily start at $80-90 per person.We were surprised and delighted that the waiter brought 3 little brownie bites with our bill. An elegant touch to an elegant meal!",Soprrrano
50,Best brunch with a breathtaking view,"We were driving on the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Diego and saw a lovely golf course overlooking the ocean. We saw that it was a Trump property and decided to drive into the country club.On our tour, we saw that they were serving a champagne brunch. The spread was magnificent and way better than any Four Seasons brunch! The presentation and service was also excellent.My advice is to go starving. I was glad that we were dressed better than casual, or I would have felt awkward.",A Tripadvisor Member
