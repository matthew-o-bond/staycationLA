40,A nice experience,The most recent display was very neat. A nice place to visit and free on Thursdays after 3pm. There's enough street parking.,Nas S
40,Tiny museum but worth the visit,"Museum has two galleries, upstairs and down. At our visit there were two new shows, with some nice pieces in each. It's not what you expect for a city museum, but we enjoyed it nevertheless. The museum emphasizes women's art in its permanent collection, and one of the two exhibits was a time line of some of that art.",Pauline K
40,Small with rotating exhibitions...combined with great views,A very Small space with rotating and changing exhibitions. The one I saw is kinda celebrating LGBQT life. It made me uncomfortable and that’s excellent thing with art. Well done and thank you. There’s also a restaurant there with terrific views and sculptures in the garden areas. Yes yes yes,Summerasalifestyle
10,Two wasted trips,"I've been here twice. The first time we lucked out and got the one open space in the parking lot. Then found the elevator wasn't working so couldn't get upstairs because I can't climb steps. Second trip no parking, drove around and around the streets looking for impossible parking. Got to museum to find the second floor is closed for installation. I wasn't willing to pay to see half a museum. They're closed several days a week, so they should be able to do their installations then and make the whole place available on weekends,when most people can go. Nothing on their website either time about any limitations.",Judy F
40,Modern Art in a Good Setting,"The museum is well laid out with a variety of objects of art. I also liked the weaved huts lining the sidewalk to the restaurant that holds a few other items of LBMA. Two floors with an elevator allow you to see many of the 3,000 permanent collection objects.",Joseph C
40,Treasure Chests,"This art museum in Long Beach has 2 locations -- one in a house overlooking the Pacific (entry fee) and the other in a downtown office spot (free admission). We visited the Hartman Pavillion on a free Thursday evening (5 - 8 p.m.) in November and chuckled over some pieces, such as the colorful pipe cleaner animals, in the Threads. exhibit and whizzed through the Artful Book show. There's a small free parking lot about 1/2 a block away and also a small gift shop. Next time we'll check out the other location.",GlobalGypsy_13
50,"Inexpensive, Well Kept, Nice Staff, Rotating Exhibitions","The LBMA is a nice facility. I have been a few times and each time they had different exhibits. I enjoyed seeing all of them. It is definitely worth the entrance fee. If you're a Long Beach resident I highly recommend taking a visit to the Long Beach Museum of Art. Also, one of the exhibit rooms has a great view of the ocean. Not to mention, they have Claire's Cafe there outside, which has phenomenal Bloody Mary's, EXCELLENT food and beautiful views.",Kyle B

40,A quiet place to relax and enjoy the coast.,"the Long Beach Museum of Art is an institution. It has weathered years and has been many things. It is now a delightful and cozy spot to view art, have a coffee and a light lunch or a fun brunch out on the grass. The view of the beach and the Pacific is lovely... I suggest this at sunset.",Sandra D
50,Lovely Location and Fun and Funky Exhibits,The Long Beach Museum of Art is a great place to spend an hour or two on a sunny or a rainy day. It is a small place and looks out over the water. The exhibits are a bit seasonal (think photos celebrating gay life for Pride Month) sometimes. But they have three shows going on at all times in addition to a few permanent pieces. A kids art space is in the basement and is lots of fun to stroll (this month it is art made by 2nd and 3rd graders). The staff is quite nice and knowledgable. The museum shop is small but is packed with stuff. Their restaurant is outdoors and first-rate with views of the LB harbor and the beach.,JLFERG
40,A nice little museum with an outstanding location,"Founded in 1950, the Long Beach Museum of Art can be found on Ocean Boulevard in the Bluff Park neighborhood of Long Beach. It is located on a bluff with an exceptional view of the Pacific Ocean. Free parking is available in the Museum parking lot on Ocean Boulevard, one block west of the main entrance, but NOTE that it can fill up pretty quickly so you may have to park along the street.The museum is made up of two buildings, the Anderson House (a restored historical residence) and the adjacent Hartman Pavilion (a two-story exhibition pavilion). The grounds are beautiful, with their unobstructed view of Long Beach Harbor and the Pacific Ocean, including views of the Queen Mary and (on a clear day) Catalina Island. The museum has become a popular venue for weddings and corporate events.There is a permanent collection of art housed here, but what the museum is known for is featuring special exhibits by one or two artists over a several month period. So, it’s advisable to check the museum’s website before visiting to verify the special exhibit is something you’d like to see.NOTE that if you have lunch at Claire’s at the Museum Café (HIGHLY recommended), you can receive ½-off admission that same day with your meal receipt.Even if you don’t feel like paying to go into the museum there are currently a couple of free outdoor exhibits worth seeing, Patrick Dougherty’s “Buddy Buddy” and Bardalo II’s “Plastic Seal.”The museum was easy to navigate, the artwork was tastefully displayed, and it won’t take you all day to go through it all. We enjoyed our visit and are likely to return.",BruinDan
50,"Small, beautifully curated art museum","It took us less than two hours to go through this small museum, but the three shows going on during our visit were thoughtfully chosen and presented. The curator(s) clearly cares about the community and has made an effort to showcase local artists; I was really impressed by the art and the innovative way the staff used the small space and resources. While we visited, there was a class of young students (kindergarten?) enjoying a field trip. I couldn't help eavesdropping on the docent; I enjoyed listening to her guiding the students through the exhibits and inviting them to look at and think about the art in different ways. The museum has a second floor and a basement, where a children's activity room and the restrooms are located; happily, they have an elevator to accommodate visitors with mobility issues. Do go outside to see the plastic seal sculpture next to the education building. The cafe in the back is a pleasant place to while away an hour before walking out to the beach.",ValleyTraveler916
30,"Small museum, wonderful exhibit.","Saw the exhibit Jane Brucerk: Fragile Thought, which I found both interesting & moving. The museum is very small & doesn't seem to have much of a permanent collection, but it is worth a visit. The brunch on weekends is offered in a beautiful setting & the food was beautifully presented & tasty.",joannkatz
50,Always Interesting and a Great Location,"There is always something interesting to see at the LBMA, and it is situated on the ocean, so the setting is lovely. Be sure and see if Clare's, the restaurant next door is open for you visit. A delightful place to eat in a gorgeous ocean-view setting and good food.",Fearless730216
50,Quaint museum before Beach stroll,The museum is a quaint place to visit it took us about 45 mins to look at their displays with Matisse as the featured artist. The have a view of the beach on their 2nd floor and ground floor have children’s art and small working studio for an artist. We enjoyed the visit and the beautiful grounds. They have a restaurant overlooking the beach but check before you go if they are open. Friday’s is half off admission. Thankful for museums.,brychewilliams
50,Beautiful Museum,With its quaint and local establishment this museum sits on the top of a hill overlooking the ocean. It’s is as beautiful on the inside as on the outside.The varying exhibits are always enlightening and fun. It is large enough to entertain mass groups while maintaining a smaller museum feel.They host several member only events as well as open events to the public. The attached restaurant offers a social experience that is catered to the local Long Beach scene.Recommended !!!,Antonio
30,Very Small museum,"This is a tiny museum but can have interesting exhibits at times. Check for free days, Friday is when we go. The best part of it is probably Claire's cafe - really lovely restaurant on the premises with seating in a lovely ouotdoor environment.",Judith D
50,Quaint and great for the cost,"My friend and I came on a day where the main exhibit halls were closed, but thus got a free look at the photo program, consisting of photographers capturing the beautiful ports and ships in Long Beach. If there were exhibits, admission would be $7, which would still be a great price. Definitely a place to visit frequently!",Andrew P
50,I LOVE THIS PLACE,"Ocean front dining in Long Beach, CA at its best. I love coming here with family and friends for weekend brunch. The entire menu is great. It's an experience everyone needs to have! Then, stop by next door and visit the Long Beach Museum of Art.",Chris C
40,Great Little Art Museum,"This is not a large museum. So, you only need a 1-2 hours to visit. But, their primary exhibits change from time to time. We visited while they had an extensive exhibit of work by the Cuban artist Rafael Soriano, representing his entire career from the early years as a geometric painter to his more recent ethereal and spiritual pieces. The exhibit was well organized around the story of the artist's life.The main museum is two stories with a lovely courtyard separating it from the old Craftsman style Elizabeth Milbank Anderson House, which is used as an administrative wing. Views from the courtyard over the beach and out to see include the Queen Mary and the Carnival Cruise terminal off to the west. Free museum parking is located just two doors down Ocean Blvd. to the west. Or, you might find street parking on the north side of Ocean Blvd. immediately across from the museum.",JDBonthemove
40,Great Setting with Changing Exhibits,"This is a sweet, compact museum that often features works of a single artist or style. There is also a permanent collection of American and European art though often not accessible due to temporary installations. It would be wise to check ahead on current exhibitions to see if they appeal to your taste. The setting is lovely, on the bluffs with views of the ocean, Long Beach, and the Queen Mary. Don't miss the downstairs sections which displays children's works. There is a small parking lot that's often full, but street parking is available within a couple of blocks and walking along the bluffs is pleasant. Admission is more than reasonable and paired with a meal at Claire's restaurant next door, it's certainly worth a visit.",Wendy M
40,"Beautiful Views, Lovely Restaurant, Great Short Visit",The Long Beach Museum of art is a beautiful old Craftsman's home restored to house art and provide a place for art lovers to come. We most recently visited to see a display of high school artwork and were pleased with the effort made by the staff to present the young people's art. We have come before to eat at the restaurant in the gardens overlooking the ocean. What a beautiful venue for a special luncheon or event! There is wheelchair accessibility but it is a bit difficult to find someone able to help open the side gate for the handicap parking or just to get inside thru the gate if you managed to find parking on the street or in one of the lots in the next block. Their hours are limited so check ahead. Very photographic area and a joy to visit.,Diane D
50,Local Gem,"It is very relaxing to stroll through this museum. It's is small and ""current"" exhibits tend to ""take over"", but it's ""our"" museum and we are proud of it. The ""attached"" Clair's is a great place for lunch and Happy Hour on Thursdays. Check their schedule.",Carol C

Claire's restaurant is open for Sunday brunch and one night a week. Its on a gorgeous patio with a fantastic view and the food is excellent. A lovely Sunday afternoon and interesting any day for the shows.,Rosemary P
50,Nice Small Museum,We were visiting friends who live nearby and toured the museum with them. The museum seems to have grown from a historic house which is now the restaurant (Claire's Café). A modern building sits beside which contains most of the exhibits. This building is three stories. The exhibits are contemporary. The basement level is the family and children's gallery. The upstairs has a large space overlooking the harbor which this day had exhibits on the harbor. We all enjoyed a black curtain enclosed room with black-light abstract art. We also liked an exhibit of sculptures of abstract animals. From the ceiling of the lobby hang numerous origami cranes above the gift shop. I liked several exhibits based of abstract miniature buildings.We enjoyed this small museum.,Kenneth L
40,Art With a View,"Happened upon this beautiful spot and really enjoyed it. The exhibit was a multi-textural multi-dimensional one. At six dollars for admission for seniors, seven regular, it is a nice diversion. The view of the beach and ships waiting to enter Long Beach Harbor is gorgeous. There is a nice outdoor café which was too packed for us on a Sunday morning, but looked nice.",Traveling teachers
50,Museum with an ocean view!,The restaurant is based in a very old mansion and of course outside with a water view. Sitting up on a bluff allows for a perfect view of Catalina on a clear day. The adjacent museum is modern and crisp yet the two go together. There are quite a few rooms over several floors and while there are permanent pieces there are also changing exhibits. Check it out - the staff is friendly and welcoming and can answer lots of questions. It's a jewel.,thizizliz
40,Small but wonderful,"Great combo for a meal and visit the museum. The staff was friendly, the current ceramics exhibition and the small enamel exhibition were both good. Worth a visit if you're in the area.",MoxieBoston
30,All depends on the temporary exhibits,"There isn't much of a permanent collection here. Can be a good 1-2 hour visit if they have an interesting temporary exhibit, but otherwise a bit sparse from an art perspective. Building is nice and in a scenic location. The on-site restaurant is also nice and scenic. But from an art perspective, only worthwhile sometimes.",Doug274
40,The view is as compelling as the art,"The museum is beautifully situated on a bluff overlooking a stunning view of the Pacific Ocean. They have exhibits that change regularly, but that amazing view and the play of light remains one of the constants that attract its visitors. In the summer, they sometimes have special programs with music, even dancers, and I always try to attend those special programs. In addition, the restaurant ""Claire's at the Museum"" offers great food and that same view, so you can enjoy the art and then have a wonderful lunch just outside on the bluff.",TrinaSchoon
40,Small but a nice place to visit if you are in town,I've been here for Easter Sunday brunch and it was great! Tons of food and a wonderful staff. Then we visited the museum next door which is nice. I usually try to go here when a new exhibit is in town.,Kara L

40,Interesting Art Museum,"Three floor museum has a continuously changing series of artists and art forms. The bottom floor was highlighting the art from a local middle school, which I thought was great. The exhibit on the third floor was interactive; however, it was lacking any directions on how to interact with each piece. More written material would have been nice.",Tangelene R

Blood Marys are awesome as well. Good service and a wonderful Sunday brunch while you are looking over the beach...what could be better!",Jon M
30,Combine this visit with a walk on the beach,The museum is small but has a charming place for a snack. Did not eat there but is a beautiful view. The museum is free on Fridays. They had some cool items but it is only about 20-30 minutes to visit the entire gallery.,summerfunteacher
40,"Small, intimate museum with wonderful exhibits","On my most recent visit to this little gem, we had a docent led tour of an exhibit of women artists that opened the previous evening. You can see everything in the museum in about an hour but can spend as much time with a piece as you like. On this visit, we were introduced to the current artist-in-residence, Lori Lamont, a water colorist. We had a great time talking to her about the inspiration for the pieces on display. This museum has a strong community presence. I believe we were told that all 5th graders from the district come to the museum for an art project. Artwork from school children is displayed downstairs. Admission to the museum is $3 as a donation. It is well worth a visit. The setting can't be beat on the ocean side of Ocean Blvd. with spectacular views of the water, Queen Mary, the oil islands and such. When you visit, make a reservation for Claire's next door.

The Museum has a private collection and it brings in different types of art for everyone to enjoy. They have the children's exhibits downstairs and that's always worth taking a look at. The museum is not very big and you can spent as little as an hour or more, depending on how you like to browse. The small gift shop is in the lobby and there are some nice things to choose from.

This is how I felt here. Loved the space (can't believe this size on the ocean was once just a ""summer"" house to a family.) Very friendly, helpful and KNOWLEDGABLE staff. It was wonderful to be able to see so much of one artist's work. Often, in larger settings, one only sees a few select pieces.

The museum has evolved over the decades, retaining its earlier charm of the lovely house where Claire's restaurant occupies the lower level and the patio overlooking the ocean.

40,Always wanted to visit,"Have driven by this museum and finally had a chance to visit. The museum property is located next to a restaurant that I'd like to try another time. The restaurant has outdoor seating and nice views of the ocean. Both museum and restaurant have identical architecture and brown singles. The museum is on the northern part of the property towards downtown Long Beach.The museum is small and you could cover it in under an hour to an hour. There are stairs and elevator access. Entrance to the museum was by donation. There were 3 sections differing in exhibits and local children's art on the basement level. The most appealing part is the upper room facing the Pacific Ocean. What views! I could see a party with cocktails and hors d'oeuvre served. Not sure if the museum allows it but I visualized this. The exhibits were not to my taste as they were mostly modern. However, I enjoyed seeing the ""Boat"" exhibits on the upper room with the view and thought it was appropriate. The museum was airy and cool and a nice thing to do on a hot day.Not sure if I'll return anytime soon though I'd like to compliment Long Beach on having such an accessible museum open to all.",ClassyJewel

40,be an artist after ur visits!!,cant believe the artist can be that artistic!! wonderful... i went there with my hubby and we both just cant bear that we really do love arts. the building itself is already an artistic creations.,taniaiskandar
40,A hidden gem,"My husband and I visited this museum last summer. Not only did we get art, but a lovely brunch, too. The museum is right on the ocean in a former East Coast philanthropist's home; an annex holds the art. The home mainly contains a very nice restaurant, located in large part on the waterfront patio, surrounding a beautiful fountain. I'd suggest sitting outside (but make reservations!) if not too hot, or get a table by an open door. The museum itself is small, but admission is low, and the exhibits interesting. Recommended for a nice Sunday visit.",OCfoodie92648
40,Nice Quiet Museum,"Pleasant Museum to get lost for and hour or so. Easy to park & I will visit again..I was visiting from Prescott, AZ & was curious & wish I had had more time..",Gary1400PCH
50,Small but COOL and Interesting Art,"The Long Beach Muesum of Art is located very close to the Queen Mary and Downtown Long Beach. It is small, but the thing I liked about it, is that almost every piece of art in it was beautiful or interesting, or special or cool. What I mean is, I have have been to so many museums and sometimes I walk through the whole thing and don't find a single piece that I even want to stop and look at, and here, I stopped to admire all of them. I liked the Hearts on the bottom floor. On the second floor, there are a lot of photos of the sunset on the ocean and one of them reminded exactly of the Revenge opening credits. The cafe is very large. We didn't go but we did walk back there and it had an exceptional view of the harbor, including the Queen Mary and the Carnival Cruise ship that we had just sailed on. Parking was free and the museum has times when it is complimentary to see. It takes about an hour to see it.",LAtoEverywhere
40,Little but nice,Our little museum is beautifully located ocean side. Nice little cafe . The changing displays are interesting most of the time.,Van L
40,Worth a Visit,"Historic building with several exhibit areas and galleries. Enjoyed the recent exhibit of American painters living in Mexico during the 20s to 50s. The restaurant, Claire's, is exceptional for its history, charm, outdoor patio on the water, and really good food. All worth a visit.",VistaDelSol
30,Nice small art museum,"Nice for a small museum. Very community minded. The family programs look great. The restaurant has limited hours, but looks like an interesting menu.",Linda W
40,Small Museum with a Great View,"We were particularly impressed with an exhibit of still art paintings and sculptures on the second floor of the museum. We saw many approaches to still lives that were unique and interesting. The view from the top floor is spectacular and it really enhanced an exhibition of sea horizon photographs. There were also excellent exhibits of paintings by California artists in Mexico and of Mexican pottery. Definitely a significant artistic asset for Long Beach. There's an adjacent restaurant with a great view. Check out the view of the THUMS islands, oil platforms disguised as decorated islands.",areview28
40,Good place to have lunch when the weather's fine,This is a small museum but a nice venue for a comfortable lunch looking out at the floating islands.,LizC2012
30,Nice happy hour on Thursday evenings,"I must admit we've never actually been inside to explore the museum, but have frequented Clair's at the Museum's happy hour on Thursday nights. hey have great little appetizers for 45, and a great view outside of the ocean. Very nice when it's dark and it's all lit up.",breistoometal
50,Great Wedding Location,We went to a wedding here last weekend and it was beautiful. The wedding and reception were both outside overlooking the ocean. Staff was great.,southerncaligirl72
40,A cultural outpost in a seaside cottage,"The city of Long Beach is bravely trying to make a THERE there, but some cultural amenities are scattered outside downtown. In this case, that's all the better. The 2-story museum is an excellent venue for 1 large or 2 smaller shows, and all the exhibits I've seen there were ones I'd return to see again. Usually local artists, which is also a point in its favor. But even if art is not your thing, you'd love the cafe. Great food - a bit pricey - outdoors on the back terrace, where you can glimpse the ocean as you eat!",Tuturista
40,A great little museum on the water with a wonderul restaurant!,"We enjoy the exhibits and the museum! Some real surprizes! And lovely docents and museaum store! And when you're finished, or even before, don't forget to eat at the restaurant, Claires! It's one of the best kept secrets in town. The menu is great and eating under the bright yellow umbrellas with metal scultures all around, looking out at the water, just can't be beat!",boloca
40,not as good as the LACMA but pretty good for its size,"They make you feel as though you being there is not just another notch on their tourist belt, it's well maintained and parking isn't a nightmare.",MCTTravels
50,"Nice place to have weddings, and dine","I have eaten at Clare's, as well as performed music for a wedding event here. Staff has always been friendly and helpful, and i highly recommend dining here, or even hosting your event.",comedicmuse
20,Worth it if you go when it's free.,Not much to the museum really. The best part of the museum is the restaurant which has a spectacular views.,Salywgn
10,skip it,Skip - the only exhibit available was ful of bestiality.,barbara h
40,"Small, quirky and fun","There was a special exhibition by Gerit Grimm which I really enjoyed. The porcelain and other exhibits were good. the staff seemed to follow me round, as security, but without any attempt to be friendly, which since we were the only 2 people in a room together was unsettling.I had a good lunch sitting outside teh acfe, but again the welcome was not as good as I would expect, the welcomer had disappeared and when I walked through to find someone I was told to go back, until I explained nobody was there. Nice view of the beach though",cookiemartini
40,Worth the climb!,"We have been here twice now, well to the doors anyway. Climbed those stairs from Bluff Park multiple times and finally made it inside. Not too pricey like I thought it might be. Very modern look with out being pretentious!",BigSarge03
50,Art feeds the soul,"We love coming here! Nice museum and always something exciting happening. Family friendly too, which is always a bonus!",Katherine H
40,Very nice!,I've seen many wonderful exhibtions here. The coastal location is fantastic.,lv2goplaces
50,Hidden gem for eating,"We had the best breakfast only served on Saturday and Sunday. You can also order the lunch menu. Beautiful inside, staff is helpful, however the hostess on Saturday can use some skills on being nicer.",css911
30,Ideal location for some interesting exhibits,"this is a small museum in a former estate sitting on the bluff overlooking the sea. It has interesting exhibits that change regularly. But for me, the restaurant, Claires, and gift store, as well as the view is what keeps me going back.",YR-LGB
40,"The food is good, the view is even better","Sit outside and look out over Long Beach harbor. Go on a nice warm, not too windy day. Limited menu, but always enjoyable.",Larry S
50,A Long Beach Gem*****,"If you have a couple of hours and want to completely relax, go to the Long Beach Museum of Art. A new, contemporary gallery, beautiful grounds on the bluff overlooking the ocean, and a nice cafe (Claire's) to grab a lunch and just stare at the ocean. Fridays are FREE!! Not an art lover? Just take a book and enjoy the quiet and the view.",sophies610
30,Friday lunch at museum,"Friday for lunch [LB Art Museum next door FREE on Fridays], both of us had fish and chips. Ample size serving [$12.00 per person] of white fish [two large pieces] and plenty of thick cut chips [fries]. Glass of Chilean Merlot [$7.00] in a large goblet, more than usual for a restaurant glass of wine. The service was excellent and attentive. We sat indoors [a little windy] but many patrons eating outside at tables with umbrellas. The rest of the menu looked a little pricy for lunch [pasta with chicken $16.00?], and there is full bar service. The view, even from indoors, was of the harbor and out to the breakwater [which has to be worth something]. We’ll probably eat here again, but on a Friday when the free museum contributes to the overall value.",RetiredTraveler78
50,Great museum right on the bluff,"The Long Beach Museum of Art is in an old Craftsman home that overlooks the ocean and has expansive views. They have wonderful, changing exhibits and FREE admission on Fridays. It is small enough to tackle in just a couple of hours, max. Claire's restaurant is on-site and overlooks the water if you choose to sit outdoors. Very nice museum.",NativeCalGal
