40,Great views,"Not as large as the one here in Las Vegas, but still very nice. It has a great view of the water and is fun to go on just for something different to do.",pspoker
50,"Great value, low cost.","I went on this ferris wheel during a visit to Long Beach, and it was quite fun. Not only was it cheap, but it also offered an awesome view of the coast and city. The ride lasted long enough for me to appreciate the experience, but not too long for it to wear out the fun. Go on this ride to have a good time.",SingingCardinal
50,Excellent views all around,"Bring your kids here, friends, family or a date. It doesn't cost very much money and you get to go around like 6 or 7 times at least. It isn't the largest Ferris Wheel in the world, but the views are quite nice looking South towards the Ocean, West towards the port, East towards Belmont Shore/Seal Beach, and North, seeing Signal Hill and on a clear day, downtown Los Angeles and the mountains in the distance.If you're visiting the Pike Outlets, or in the area at all, take a visit to the Ferris Wheel!**Keep arms and legs inside the car at all times, the design does pose a safety threat FYI**",Kyle B
40,AWESOME WATER VIEWS,Very cool older styled Ferris Wheel. Really great views of the Boats and Water and Harbor areas. Treat yourself to a blast from the past.,Hialeah73
30,OK For Some...Great For Others,"My Wife and I grew up in Brooklyn, New York and were Wonder Wheel types so this small Ferris Wheel is just ok. This attraction is just a short walk from the Hyatt Hotel where we stayed. I think any kids will love it.",Richard S
40,Great views,My grandchildren love to come here to visit us from South Orange County. we have Aquarium passes so we try to come down here with them every time they visit. They love the Merry Go Round and Ferris wheel. We enjoy the whole Pike area experience even being locals.,ginahicks921
50,TREAT YOURSELF AT NIGHT,"We lucked in to a street party and free rides on the ferris wheel. It is a nice way to take in the waterfront and part of the Pike, especially at night. Ferris wheels are fun but someday they'll figure out how to make boarding and deboarding more efficient",SenorGancho
50,"Come on, its a ferris wheel!","Never a long line, the ride is long enough, and the views are great! A novelty in downtown Long Beach. Not exactly the Santa Monica Pier, but thankful to have this gem in LB.",travelingrules
50,Kids had a blust!,It is the best thing to do in Long Beach. It is really great to get up in the air in the Ferris wheel and see the Harbor from up there. It is beautiful and it is peaceful. Really enjoyed the ride. It is very inexpensive. Lots of fun.,ArtRussianMom
