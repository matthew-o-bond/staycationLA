10,Tiger King in the Making?,"We went here last year. I hear they’ve relocated since then. It was beautiful there with the Vasquez Rocks in the background. At first thought, what’s the harm? Petting, sharing your love with these beautiful creatures. But you have to be less selfish and consider all of the ramifications of what you’re doing.Just watch the documentary Tiger King on Netflix.While there we had an experience at the picnic table, hands on photo op. One of the handlers did things with the baboon directly in front of me that we were all warned NOT to do. And the baboon’s behavior was definitely annoyed, which made people uncomfortable. I read in another review that Peta is trying educate the operators of Animal Tracks to the bigger picture and I hope they succeed. Nobody who cares deeply for these creatures would EVER profit off of them.",brewsterstravels
50,Adventuring with Monkeys,"I love visiting animal sanctuaries. It's one of my new favorite things to do, especially since I have a new camera and love to practice with wildlife photos.For Valentine's Day this year, my boyfriend took me to Animal Tracks. What an amazing experience this was! I had no idea it existed and it was only an hour from home.We did the monkey experience. They sat us at a long picnic table with bowls of food/fruit and brought the monkeys out to see us. They visited us, climbed all over us and interacted at their own pace. It was one my favorite animal interactions to date! I wish they were closer to my house so I could be a volunteer!If you have a free day, please check them out. The people that work there truly love these animals and it shows. I can't wait to go back for the full experience which is 3 hours long and includes many other animals at the sanctuary!",Patty Leemhuis
50,Fennec Fox,"It is real fascinating to touch animals that you would not normally touch in the wild like an armadillo, kangaroos and a fennec fox.The Fennec Fox is the smallest carnivore of dog like animals. Dog like animals include foxes, jackals, wild dogs, hyenas, etc. This nocturnal fox lives in the desert sands of North Africa.",baseballcardassassin
50,Adventurebuddies42 goes to Animal Tracks,"To celebrate our Grammi’s birthday we did a private hands on experience at Animal Tracks which was incredible! The kids loves the baby monkeys jumping all over us, Grammi’s favorite was the Lemur, and all the amazing pictures we got... unforgettable! But what we liked most was during the animal interactions the staff educated us about all the issues they see and what we can do about it. The kids really listened and through our experience we have sent others who also have greatly enjoyed the overall experience. Your money goes to a good cause!",The Adventure Buddies
50,Meet a Monkey!,"I did the private Monkey and Mammal Encounter and it was honestly a life-changing experience. I can't recommend this highly enough. The animals are treated with so much respect and care, and it's obviously a labor of love for the staff, who are friendly and knowledgeable. If you're traveling anywhere near L.A., set aside a day to visit Animal Tracks. It was the best! There is so much love in this place. Can't recommend highly enough. You get a hands-on encounter with a monkey, and a ton of information. Go, enjoy, donate, and tell your friends!",Dan N
50,A Life Experience with exotic rescued animals,"This is not an experience you can get from any zoo. First hand encounters with exotic animals who choose to say hello, each in their way, was the high light of this place! Monkeys, fennec fox, kangaroos, snakes, skunk, armadillos, porcupines, wolves, emus, alligator, and many more. The animals bond with their own selected trainers, and live a quality life after being rescued from their situations. The personal tour price, compared to Disneyland, is SOOO worth it! Take your camera. Our tour group of 7 was a perfect number.",seeit4myself
50,Amazing animals and people encounters!,"Superlatives can't describe this place of love and care for homeless exotic animals. We experienced first hand encounters with monkeys, kangaroos, fennec foxes, skunks, porcupines, wolves, snakes, armadillos, and many others. Here animals bond and are cared for as family by their own chosen trainers. A baby monkey chose to sit on my shoulder, wrap it's tail around my neck, and groom my hair. A large cat purred and rubbed against my leg. A fennec fox is cuter and softer than any teddy bear. Amazing!",seeit4myself
50,Amazing,If you don’t make sure to stop here you are missing out one of the most amazing fun educational hands on experiences you could dream of. I had a blast. I took my gf as a birthday gift and I’ve never seen her so excited and happy. We both love animals and I can’t say enough about how much fun we had. Go and soak it all up! Make sure your phone is fully charged because you can and will want to take pictures non stop.,Jake L
50,One of the best unknown attractions in LA!,"Really had a great day visiting with all the cute and friendly animals at Animal Tracks. The staff really corralled around the small group of us to ensure all our questions were answers and experience was positive. We met a great number of animals in this sanctuary tucked in the hills of Agua Dulce. From scorpions and snakes to monkeys and porcupines, we saw it all! We opted for the 3 hour tour which ran around $130 however well worth the cost as we sat WITH monkeys close and personal for almost an hour alone among other parts of the interactive tour. I've never had the experience of being so close to these beautiful creatures and here they interact with each of us and allowed for plenty of selfie opportunities. Bring extra cash for tipping as the experience they provided was well deserving. This tour does not do any hard selling for tips or t-shirts and I really respected that which is unlike anywhere else in LA. I would book a trip there now before it becomes popular and inundated with tourists - nows the time! And say hello to the most adorable Dobby The Fox (who has his own Instragram account!).",MooshLA
50,Monkey see! Monkey do!,I love this experience. Getting to be up close and personal with all these beauties was such a treat. I took my mom for her birthday and she loved it. We have never been to anything like this and I'm an avid believer that animals do not deserve to be in zoos or aquariums etc. So it was great to hear all these animals personal story. Some were sad... bit more of a reason for me to support and donate to places like Animal Tracks.,Charde
50,Come visit!,"Fantastic visit, so much interactive time with monkeys and many of the other pets there. This staff clearly loves these animals and takes great care.",Jring85
50,Best Birthday Ever!,"In the canyons, northeast of Los Angeles is the tiny town of Agua Dulce and just outside of it is a little slice of heaven for the animal lover. Guided tour (3 hours) Hands-on experience with monkeys, baboon, a beautiful, well mannered wolf dog. Unfortunately, we had a dog in day care and had to leave a little early, but I know some of the animals still to come -- kangaroo, porcupine, raccoon, some others. Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff. Not everything is touchable and the staff makes certain everyone is safe. I don't know what age you need to be to attend was it wasn't relevant to me, so check their website. I doubt young children would be allowed. They do not advertise as every cent that comes in goes to the animals' care. Take some fresh veggies with you; there's a list on their website. I can't remember the last time I had that good of an experience with animals and I've been to Africa 3 times! And you're on dirt, so don't go in the rainy season. We went mid-March and it was beautiful. Wear clothes that can get dirty and closed-toe shoes.",sheri1946
50,Best Experience Ever,"My wife took me on the Sanctuary Tour for my bday. This was the best experience I have ever had with exotic animals. It exceeded both of our expectations. Being a monkey lover, being able to sit at a table with them for an hour was something I will mever forget. Every single tour guide was extremely nice and knowledgable. If you are an animal lover, this is a must stop. You will not regret it.",AdamDrex
50,Best time ever!,Wonderful hands on time at a place where they truly care about each animal and making sure you get the best experience possible! Would definitely come back out to California just for this!,Kade T

You can tell how much the workers here love what they do and are super knowledgeable and ready to answer any questions you may have! The animals are so happy and loved and that made my heart happy. We got the animal adventure combo which gives you the option to interact with more different types of animals but they have different packages too!:)Everything from Marley the Capuchin monkey to Sara the pig to Winston the kangaroo! A dream come true for any animal lover! 30/10 would recommend to anyone. Make sure to bring some snacks with you to feed the little ones, they’ll greatly appreciate it.",heeykarinaa
50,Spectacular personal experience,We went as a solo surprise celebrating our anniversary. Truly an extraordinary experience. Personnel knowledgeable and animals of a sort we rarely encounter. Intimate contact with most of the animals always feeling safe due to the staff’s keen awareness and their knowledge through lengthy observation of individual animals.,Ziva O
50,Amazing interactive tour of non-profit exotic animal sanctuary by reservation only,"Don't miss this wonderful experience! My daughter and I went on the private tour for my birthday. A special highlight was interacting with 2 capuchin monkeys, a baboon, and a squirrel monkey. They actually come to sit with you at a picnic table. What an amazing experience!! We took so many pictures! Stacy and her staff are so dedicated and clearly have strong bonds with the animals in their care. This is a non-profit rescue facility so each animal has it's own story of how they came to live there. We were able to interact with many different types of animals including kangaroos, hybrid wolves, a fox, a boa constrictor, a skunk, a serval, and many more. You can check them out at animaltracksinc.org.",Linda S
50,Great experience at a great place,"Have visited twice great to see the animals well taken care of by lovely, caring & dedicated people/volunteers. Animals seem very relaxed in a beautiful setting. It is a calm, quiet place, interaction with them is fun but unique too. My favourite animal is a wolf & you get to meet 2 lovely ones The animals there have a calming effect on you but lots of fun too especially with the monkeys. The porcupines are hilarious The tour by Stacy is very informative and the visit worth every penny (or cent!)....go visit you will not be disappointed.",M J
50,Tucked Away Hidden gem,"If you're visiting the area, take a few hours and visit Animal Tracks. Tours are up close and personal, super educational and a ton of fun!! I loved it so much I sent them items from their Amazon wish list and I am visiting again....and again!!",JeniPartee
50,Excellent!,"My friend has been here many times and finally for my birthday, I decided to check this place out. Stacy and the volunteers are great! We did a 2 hour tour which started at the bottom of the hill and led up. They give you lots of information about the animals and backstories as to why the sanctuary has received them. There are so many different types of animals you get to meet on the tour! My personal favorites were the serval, the fennec fox, and the kinkajou. What I really enjoyed about this place was how much the animals loved and trusted Stacy and the volunteers. You can really tell they all have such a big passion for animals and that they are well taken care of.",Gracie P
50,Keeping it Wild!! Experience an Ed-Venture!,"Today I had such a terrific day at Animal Tracks Inc, in Agua Dulce, Ca! This is a relaxed and very informative interactive activity for the whole family! Any age will Love this day venture!Animal Tracks is a Non-Profit organization, with the motto of educating the public and provide a home for animals that can't be returned to their natural habitats.The Staff is extemely informative and starts you off telling the background of the 2 homes which belonged to an old Western Movie actor Mr. Montana who wanted to rescue animals that needed homes from the Movie industry.Firstly you are greeted by Robert Redford the horse!

They are doing a great job!Please also check into PETA, they are trying to shut this facility down as they say the animals are being abused , but I didn't see any of that, the animals are all healthy, well fed and respond to the staff very comfortably! The animals are all very Happy!We should all be happy to support organizations that not only educate, but give us a first hand chance to learn about all the fascinating animals, reptiles and insects that are part of this Amazing World God Created.",HawaiianIrishgirl
