40,Quirky Home-Museum,"This museum is an old homestead home built into a boulder pile, with a boulder-strewn desert butte backdrop! In addition to the usual arrowheads and pottery, there are impressive examples of baskets, textiles, cordages, & sandals that don't usually survive. There are interpretive displays of food, fiber, and pigment preparation. The home is lavishly decorated with painting and decor that are like a Southwest fantasy (the first owner was an artist)!Open to the public ONLY on Saturdays after 11 am. (Check the website! Group tours during weekdays are only by appointment.)Why did I wait so long to see this? Well, it's a ways from Lancaster (150th St. East!), past large alfalfa fields, far to the east of the city. You'll see Joshua tree ""forests"" and other small desert buttes, along with forlorn trailers and abandoned homesites. WELL Worth the trip!!",Norm G
50,Fun day trip,"We spent a few hours at the Antelope Valley Indian Museum. The ranger and volunteer told us the history of the museum and showed us pictures. There were many artifacts from the past history of the Native American's that use to inhabit the area. The hiking trail is nice and not hard to navigate. Just watch out for wild animals and stay on the trail. If you need to burn a few hours, come to the Antelope Valley Indian Museum.",Hylianknight
40,Educational and cool,"This was my first time here and it was a really cool place. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The museum looked small from the outside, but it was deceptive as it was actually much bigger on the inside. Lots of interesting artifacts and art pieces and there's a really neat rock stairs that you climb to get to the upper part of the museum.The staff said there's hiking trails in back which is a major plus in my book. It was too rainy today, but I will have to come back in the future to check out the trails. At only $3 for a ticket and free parking this was a fun and affordable adventure.",Carolina Arias
40,Insightful and in so serene desert surroundings!,"If you can make it this way through, plan a visit at this place. Only open in weekends. We went from LA one Saturday in the beginning of October. Late October there is a celebratory Pow Wow, so make sure to check it out if possible, we missed it, but I bet it is something! We spent some time on our own but there's guides around to simply ask anything, they really know about the history. And the walk in the area was blissful â€“ really worth the trip.",S. Moeller
40,My first visit was in 1953 and have been there many times over the years. Good memories.,"My first visit was 3rd grade in Palmdale School. That was the only school in Palmdale and everybody went there. You had to go to Lancaster for Jr High. We had an Annual school trip to the Indian Museum every year. All of the boys would go crazy climbing the rocks, looking for Rattlesnakes and trying to catch ""Chucawallas"". They were like a Gila Monster but no poison in their bites. Tarantulas were fun to hold and scare the girls. By the end of the day we were all pooped out. We loved it and still do and I'm 75 years old now.",Robert Berberich
50,Jewel in the desert,"A super value destination. The admission and drive is worth it. A relaxing trip in local history with the unique architecture and a wealth of native American displays. the second floor is not for the handicapped, but mobile seniors should make the effort upstairs for the presentation. The trail is a good viewing walk when the weather is not too hot.",Art d
50,A Wonderful Gem in the Mojave Desert,"The Antelope Valley Indian Museum is one of the most special historical places I have ever visited. A beautiful story, amazing artifacts, and great scenery. Next time I will take a picnic lunch or afternoon tea; to enjoy after touring the museum. There is an outdoor eating area with table and chairs. In addition to checking out the actual museum, we enjoyed taking a walk on the track that surrounds the property. The museum staff gave us a little leaflet about the surrounding area, which we could refer to as we walked around the track. The expansive views of desert landscape dotted with many beautiful buttes is breathtaking. I highly recommend a visit to this enchanting piece of history tucked away in the Mojave desert.",NesbugTraveler
40,small museum,"The museum is small but kids had fun looking through all the stuffs. We stayed about 20 minutes. If you are in the area, it is nice to stop by. But I would not make a trip here just for the museum.",Linda W
40,Very interesting.,I've been coming to the AV since 1972 (yes a long time). This was the first time going to the Indian Museum. It was interesting. You can walk around the property on a trail. This one time home was for a collector of Indian objects. I enjoyed it enough to suggest that is interesting enough. Enterance fee is cheap !,Nick H
50,Feel the integration of cultures,You can see Mid-west and Californian indigenous artifacts that Howard Arden Edwards collected about 100 years ago. You can also see the integration of European and Native cultures in this very museum. It is one that lets you know how people did things wrong long time ago. It is a nice and quiet place. Open only on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. Pay $3/adult at the gift shop. Free for kids.,michikos2017
10,Closed,"We were disappointed that this museum was open so few hours. We didn't get to see it because it was never open during the three days we were in Lancaster. It might be great, but the hours certainly aren't.",CLC48
40,Don't Miss the Nature Trail Out Back,"We love this museum, with its dreamlike cave passages and vintage displays. Definitely stop here, admission is only a few bucks and you won't see other places quite like this. (We don't, however, love the bossy young guy who works there -- others do -- who insists that you listen to his spiel and inspect the photos in his album when you'd rather wander the facility by yourself. He can get pretty snippy when you pass him by or accidentally brush up against a piece of furniture. But a neat experience nonetheless.) When you're finished with the interior of the museum, don't miss the short nature trail loop that begins just outside. There's a weathered cabin and great rock formations to provide good photo ops. After that, you might want to zip over to Saddleback Butte for a hike (in good weather), or walk around in the Phacelia Wildlife Sanctuary nearby (there's an impressive Joshua tree forest just north of Saddleback on the way. Look up the Wildlife Sanctuaries tab on the Parks LACounty Gov website for locations of other open space preserves in the area.)",SoCalRambler
50,BEAUTIFUL and INSPIRING,"What a great part of the Native American Culture. The museum was simply beautiful and offered alot of history. If you are older and have troubles walking or keeping balance, may not be a good place to go, well at least upstairs would be difficult. The only thing I could suggest would to be offer more in the Gift Shop. I was alittle disappointed in the very limited selection. What a missed opportunity.",drhodes227
50,Best experience,"The staff are amazing and really know the story regarding the museum itself. When I got there, I was really confused about the details on some of the artifacts, specifically in the second stage of the museum (the dinning room). As I wondered around the museum I was lucky to bump into one of the staff there who explained in detail many aspects of the museum, such as details explaining that the museum was actually a house and that the man who initiated the museum was not even densely familiar with the Indian culture. There is so much behind this history of the museum that each artifact makes you second guess its real meaning.",Nessy m
50,Small with a lot of history,"Great family spot for locals or travelers wanting to stay in Los Angeles area. The museum is built into the rock walls, lots to see. Museum once was a home with the original painting (artwork) is well preserved. Joshua tree lumber used in the building construction. Great place to visit, very inexpensive entrance fee. Gift shop available.",Chamorrita T
40,Native American Museum worth the trip,This is a small Native American Museum (in the middle of nowhere but worth the trip) -- the artifacts are very interesting and they sell hand made Native American jewelry.,Jan B
50,One of the best true Indian Museums in California,This Indian Museum has been a part of my life from childhood Back in 1953 I went here with my Cub Scout den. Form that time until I left CA I made several visits here. More recently it was just as I remembered long time ago. The web site is an excellent preview of the History and gives information about the open hours and tours.The ANTELOPE VALLEY INDIAN MUSEUM is a genuine trip back to the days when the white man did not live in the antelope valley. Well worth the visit and only $3. for adults.,Michael F
50,Muesum,"This is a great place to take out of town visitors. It is inexpensive, and interesting inside and out. We took our 80+ parents and they really enjoyed it.",johnjerim
50,Hidden Gem of Museums,"Wonderful place to stroll NOT only inside the Museum, but... outside as well. There is a nice ""interpretive"" walk with markers. Those ""reveal"" the history of that particular place or object. The Museum has a beautiful ""carved"" stairs to the second floor.",Maria L
30,Be sure to check when open,Can't say anything about the museum as we went out through a sandstorm so thick we could hardly see the road only to find it was closed except by reservation except on Saturday and Sunday. I would have loved to see it.,Disodora
50,Terrific State Park,"Yes, visit this museum and state parkHistory of those that came before usKinda far away from the city it'll but worth the driveBesides you can also view Saddleback Butte as well as kill bill church",Summerasalifestyle
30,indian artifacts,if u want to know the history of the Indians that lived here in the Antelope Vally this is the best place to learn about them,Andre V
50,Who knew this was in my backyard?,This museum is such a hidden gem and I am so disappointed that I haven't come here sooner. The docents and park rangers are very helpful and willing to share the stories of the history of this museum and the town of Lake Los Angeles. The museum itself is built directly into the huge boulders that make up the area and is filled with Antelope Valley history.It's a bit of a drive but worth it . Make sure to walk the trail around the property where you can feel the sacredness of the land. A great day trip.,TanyaRussell_13
50,Very interesting and eduacational experience. Much more than I expected!,"This great Indian museum had much more than I expected! Docents give great backgrounds and interesting facts. Historic displays, artifacts, artworks, photos are well organized and cover multiple Indian tribes from throughout California. The building has much history as well., don't miss the 2nd floor, the climb is worth it.The day we were there Indian dance teams performed and multiple vendors were selling their Indian art, jewelry, pottery, baskets, etc...(but that's not the norm.) My companion thanked me for dragging him there.",295tammie
40,Unexpectedly Amazing and Beautiful,"Fun if you like southwestern art, native American artifacts, unusual architecture, the Mojave desert, and related subjects, which I do very much. Nice women running the museum, and exemplary well-cared for grounds and exhibits. Absolutely worth seeing.",DesertmanDrew
30,Museum in Transition,"This museum was originally the homestead of H A Edwards (an artist by trade) who built the building as a vacation home over a rock formation on Piute Butte. He used the upper room to hold his displays of Indian artifacts that he had accumulated. He also provided his own interpretations on how many of the artifacts may have been used. The second owner added onto the building and added her own Native American artifacts.The State of California took possession of the property around 1980, but has done very little to improve the property in the last 35 years other than place a few signs in the museum indicating that the artifacts were acquired by collectors and not archeologists. There were also signs indicating that attempts at cataloging and dating the artifacts are underway, but it doesn't look like much progress in this area has occurred in the dozen years that the State of California has operated the museum.There is also an outdoor path with a rather imaginative written trail guide that provides someoneâ€™s view of what you are looking at. Many of the items pointed out are too far away from the trail to properly view, and you are warned not to leave the trail. I was more impressed with the original displays from H A Edwards.",Rodski11
50,Survivors-Native American style,"Informative, educational, and serene are words to describe the Antelope Valley Indian Museum with its rich examples of life in the Mojave Desert. The Serranos, plus other Great Basin tribes that are on display, were more agricultural than warriors or hunters and they adapted, leaving a beautiful array of basketry.Grinding slicks, Joshua trees, coyotes and communicating through pictographs were just part of their everyday life.A small, easy hiking trail is available, but you will need a sunhat and sunscreen because there is limited shelter, except the museum which has air-conditioning.",avidhiker2
50,*Great Museum History*,This is a great place to go with family. Has a lot of history from 1930's Indians. Small but so much things to see in how they built houses and made pottery and so many other things. Has a small 1/2 hour walk trail outside. Was very cheap to get in and kids under 12 are free. Would recommend this place to anyone.,GENA2010
40,Museum with History,"Unique museum with fascinating history, amazing atmosphere, passionate staff, and beautiful artifacts. The interior appears built into the stone of the surrounding butte. Artifacts are displayed in casual places such as on a mantelpiece or set on a table. On view are woven baskets and rugs, pottery, querns, arrowheads, and paintings. Staff are friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. This museum began as a private collection, then passed through different hands with different focuses before it became a state museum. All of the museum's history is displayed in a way that provokes as much interest as its collection. I look forward to another visit .",Sigridrausch
30,Not bad,Great setting...the museum staff excellent... Exhibits interesting. Would recommend. Nice gift shop.,Rockcreek423
40,Native American History Field Trip,This is worth the trip especially if you are into local Native American history. The story of the museum is interesting and the displays are excellent quality. It's even better when they are putting on a Pow Wow. You could really learn something. Very enjoyable.,SgtMikes
50,Museum of my youth,"This museum is a real gem hidden in the middle of the Mojave Desert. I remember 45 yrs. ago coming out to this place with my Girl Scout Troop and my mother, she was one of my troop leaders. The museum was interesting back then but in the recent decade or so the place has really had lots done to it and it looks Fabulous. Be sure to check out the schedule as it is not open all the time due to State budget cuts ...",Joni S
50,AV Indian Museum,"As a scout leader I have taken many of Cub Scout to the Indian Museum. Lots to see, and hands on activities can be arranged for the youth.",inspectrdad
40,Will worth driving a bit out of the way,"This is a State facility. it houses a surprising amount of indian artifacts. The items representa group of several desert tribes. Some of the artifacts were dug up from indian burial sites. The building was once a private home and collection work. Outside there is a 1/2 mile desert walk wich does an average job of pointng out things of interest. While you are there, why not, but the main value is inside! Price $3 pp. Adequate parking. Near M and 150th. Not to handicap friendly.",ranles76
50,rock house,i love this place not only do you learn about the area Indians but the museum is built into a rock. everyone should go there .,Gretchen S
50,Well worth the visit!,"Howard Arden Edwards built his home into the mountain, and it is uniquely fantastic! He incorporated boulders and the mountain into his home so they become part of his home. The myriad artifacts are enthralling, but I must say the home itself is spectacular! Open on weekends, the county has managed to air condition the interior without using an air conditioner, having huge piping drawing cool air from underground. There are outbuildings as well, and the surrounding scenery is near a sacred Indian site with pictography from long ago. There is a small entrance fee for adults, children 12 and under are free, and if you have the time, I strongly suggest you visit this site with children in tow. Our children were fascinated, never having been to such a museum with narrow rock staircases and mountain boulders incorporated into walls. It was well worth the time, and we plan to visit again!",bellofthedesert
50,Antelope Valley Indian Museum State park,"When it's open -( one of the State Parks closed at the moment,) it is a fine private collection of Native American art and crafts. Well worth a visit.",Janet W
