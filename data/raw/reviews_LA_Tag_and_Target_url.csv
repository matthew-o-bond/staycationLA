50,"Super an Awesome Idea....Great birthday party, sports team event or fundraiser","Who doesnt have fun with Nerf Guns? It is an indoor Nerf Gun shooting facility with bunkers and unlimited ammo.Birthday party prices are a steal.Arrive 15 min. before the birthday party. Each person signs a waiver. Each person is given a vest, googles, gun. Prior to going on the battle field, a group photo is taken with a cute backdrop to capture the memory.For $4 more per person, you can upgrade to a premium gun and trade as much as you likeThere is plenty of bench seating for parents to surround the battle field. There are 3 tables for food and cake (seating about 25).1 group at a time, which I always like private partiesSports fundraiser is also an option (which they will donate 20% back to the team), but must be 25 people min for dedicated 1 hour. I recommended charge more for higher donation amount, but maybe they would arrange privately.The kids and adults had fun non-stop. I thought 75 mins of Nerf gun is too much, but it wasnt.Everyone needs to go here at least once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALinCA5512
