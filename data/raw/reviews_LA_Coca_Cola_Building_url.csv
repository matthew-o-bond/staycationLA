40,Art Deco Classic ...,"The Coca Cola building is an attraction that you can enjoy from the outside as tours of the building aren't available to the public. I drive by it when I'm in the southern part of downtown LA. Surrounding area is mostly light industrial, trades and warehouses. Love the true Art Deco ship shape & details. Hopefully it'll become a museum or public building one day. Drive all around it! Enjoy. ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
30,"Streamline Moderne ""Ship"" in a Downtown Adjacent Neighborhood","If you are an architecture or Art Deco enthusiast, then this is an interesting building to go see. That being said, there is nothing other than the building (and a giant Coca-cola bottle) to see. It is a bottling plant. There are no tours of the facility. There is not really anything nearby except for the African American Firefighters Museum across the street (which is more interesting in my opinion)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevew11
40,Great photo shoot area,"It looks like a massive ocean liner in the middle of South central Los Angeles. This is not that far from LAX, and makes for a quick stop. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but there is plenty of parking on the side streets and the architecture of this building makes it pretty interesting. The only thing that would make this better is if they had a soda fountain or malt shop near by where you could sample the goods. Reminded me a bit of Willy Wonka's factory :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TryppAdams
10,Not worth the bother,This really isn't worth seeing at all. Apart from a great big coca cola bottle outside you wouldn't know otherwise . There's no museum or shop to see. The area is horrible if you must go make sure you drive I wouldn't want to walk around there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs21
30,Not really impressive,"The building looks good, but it's not really worth to go there specially for it. And neighbourhood not really friendly",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kulbacki
