50,"Avenue Q - So funny, great place!!","Went to see Avenue Q. First time going to this theatre. Very small intimate theater, seats are good no matter where you sit. The cast was fantastic! This show is hilarious and so good. Not for little kids that's for sure. I took teens and it was fine. Yes some inappropriate matter for sure but I already knew this. If you are not sure, then look into it before you go see Avenue Q. We loved it! Laughed so hard. Cupcake Theater was great! It's nothing fancy for sure, but we liked that. Entertaining and very reasonable tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv80s
50,Intimate theater with fantastic cast,"Initially, I was a little skeptical about seeing a production here. It isn’t one of the big theaters in LA and I have not heard much about it, but we bought tickets anyway. None of the 4 of us had seen Avenue Q and had always wanted to. This production was amazingly funny! The cast did an exceptional job, made everyone laugh, and had a great time doing it. The male and female lead for last night’s show were fantastic! They did multiple voices (and even sang in those voices) and had great chemistry together. The ensemble cast members were also really good (Gary Coleman!)! Overall, the production was really well done! I highly recommend seeing a production with this theater!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aikanebelezrealtor
50,"Avenue Q— hilarious show, great venue!","My boyfriend and I are NY tourists and was looking for a show and happened to come across the Cupcake Theater showing Avenue Q (opening night) we were amazed at the venue and the show!The venue is cozy and there is literally no bad seat in the house. The cute photo op before entering the show room was a nice touch. You are called up by group and then can seat yourself with general admission. Concessions, including: snacks, alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks are available for purchase and are allowed in the theater itself. Avenue Q runs from October-January and if you are in the area, tourist or local would highly recommend this HILARIOUS crude yet relatable show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethgrese
50,Dreamgirls is Dreamy,If you have the opportunity to see ANYTHING at Cupcake Theater you will see a great show at a reasonable price for the most entertaining and lively musical performance in the area. Right now the show is Dreamgirls. I have seen everything they have shown since moving to this venue and i will try not to miss anything upcoming.get a ticket and go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCSZ41
50,Small intimate experience,"My husband and I bought tickets to see the musical “Into the Woods” at the Cupcake Theater and we were very happy we did. The theater is small which makes for an intimate experience. I’d recommend getting there early because parking is hard to come by and you’ll likely have to park 5-7 minutes away. The theater sells popcorn, drinks and snacks to enjoy during the performance. The set and actors are very professional and even though we had discount tickets, we got a Broadway caliber show. My only complaint would have to be the seats do get a little uncomfortable but thank goodness for intermission. We’ll definitely be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
