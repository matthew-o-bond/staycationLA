40,Interesting Little Museum,"Honestly, I hadn't heard of this place until my son and I were invited to visit by a friend for his event. This is a unique little museum. While the event took up most of our time there, we did have a few minutes to walk through the museum. It's a small ""store-front"" type of museum contains a pretty good overview of the various martial arts.As the other reviews cover the museum, here's some logistics to consider:Parking: It's all street parking and limited to two hours. Check the signs. There is a parking structure but it's for another building so don't park there. Park on Brighton or Lincoln north of Magnolia and then walk over. It'll get you off the main street.Restaurants: There are some small eatery's within walking distance up and down Magnolia.Burbank has a lot to offer so if you're in the area, add this little gem to your itinerary.",Paul S
50,A Surprise Gem,Such a cool place for martial arts enthusiasts. Great displays and so well organized. Easy to get to and easy parking.,happytraveler552
50,Martial Arts History Museum - a must see if you are in the LA area!,"The museum presents an incredible, concise history of martial arts with room to grow! With over 50 years of experience in the martial arts world, Michael Matsuda, founder and president of the museum has written for and consulted on numerous martial arts publications and filmography. I enjoyed a great conversation with him on the museum, its exhibits and the Hall of Fame martial artists captured in his 3 volume set. You can also purchase copies of the 3-volume set of Martial Arts Hall of Fame with Volume 4 coming out in early 2019. My whole family enjoyed the experience, even both my daughters!",Ben E
50,James Lew Day At The Museum,Martial arts legend James Lew was honored at the museum on November 4. James Lew has had an illustrious career in show business since the early 1970s when he played a young Shaolin Monk on the TV series “Kung Fu”. James won the Emmy for his stunt coordination on the TV series “Luke Cage.” It was an honor just to be part of the crowd that gathered at the museum for this event.,dbrgdmn
50,A+,"Loved this museum! It’s small and can probably be in and done within and hour. But it is beautiful, filled with info, and has some really fun stuff. The people were very kind and we really enjoyed it.",Rachel L
50,Enjoyable afternoon!,"From real life martial artists to ones in film, this place displayed and honored all. Even martial arts in animation! Check the website, sometimes they have events and the actual martial artists are there! My favorite part was the small Karate Kid section, I loved that movie!",Deonna2
50,Red Carpet Event,"Held the day after Dragonfest, celebrities such as Emmy Nominee, James Lew were on hand to meet and greet visitors to the museum. Photo ops were available on the red carpet outside the museum. Other celebrities included Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, Douglas Wong, Art Camacho, and many more. This was a great event, and I hope to see more like it in the not too distant future.",dbrgdmn
40,"Good Place to Visit in Burbank, CA.","We stopped here because three people in my family are martial artists. It is a cool place to visit. It is smaller than expected. They have a scavenger hunt for little kids, and it is cool to learn about the history of many martial arts and they have cool exhibits there too. I would recommend a visit to this place if you can.",nickh7777
50,Ewart Chin Day,"I went to Burbank to film ""Ewart Chin Day"" at the museum for my TV show ""Martial Arts Mania!"". It's like a family reunion every time I go here. It's a gathering place for friends and fellow martial artists. I love this place!",dbrgdmn
30,One of a kind in San Fernando Valley,"The owner collects and asks for items from various martial artists, collection is varied and interesting....",100PENANG
40,Small but interesting.,"The museum is basically one room, but it is interesting & the owner/curator is super nice. It is multi-media (things to read, videos & props). If you're in the Burbank area, it's something different to do. Go on Groupon to get discount tickets (I got 2/$9 today). While you are there, I recommend eating at Pinnochio Italian Restaurant/Deli & stopping by Halloweentown (all on the same street, but a couple of blocks apart). Also, walk around Magnolia Blvd while you're there, because there are so many independent & eclectic shops (rockabilly clothing, trains, model cars, comic books, etc).",Marlene H
50,Honoring Douglas Wong Day,"This is one of the best kept secrets in Burbank. It's an interesting place for even non-Martial Artists. On Saturday, May 30th, the museum honored Douglas Wong for his contributions to the World of Martial Arts.",dbrgdmn
50,Eric Lee Day at the Museum,"I made a special trip to Burbank to attend ""Eric Lee Day"" at the museum. Eric has appeared in many movies throughout the years, and has been a guest on my TV show ""Martial Arts Mania!"". There were many other Martial Arts Movie Stars in the audience, too numerous to mention, but a few examples were: Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, Cynthia Rothrock, Hank Garrett, Douglas Wong, and (Oh...ah...his name escapes me, but he was on ""Star Trek""). Anyway, if you ever get a chance, drop by the museum, and tell the Curator (Michael Matsuda) that you read Debbie Goodman's review on Tripadvisor!",Debbie G
30,"Small, but interesting","I was in the area and checked TripAdvisor to see what museums were in the Burbank area. Being a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do I was interested to see that there was a martial arts museum. It's a small storefront and Michael, the founder is there to greet you. He made it very clear that this was about the history of martial arts in the US, particularly how it's infiltrated movies and TV. I appreciated his honesty and paid my $10 to go. I didn't have a lot of time (about 30 minutes) and I could have used probably another 15-30 minutes to really read the displays and watch the videos.While I wouldn't put it on a must-see list, I'm glad I visited, and if you're in the area and have any interest in martial arts, whether the old TV show Kung Fu, or even Kung Fu Panda, it's worth stopping in.",Alan B
40,Great place to take a slow stroll and learn some interesting stuff!,"If you're a Martial arts fan & you've got about 40 minutes to spare, head over to this museum... It's not gonna inundate you with info, yet there's enough to teach you a few things you may not have known... Give it a try!",278jeffreyd
50,Surprising little museum,"We weren't sure what to expect when came here, but this museum packs a lot into a small space. We talked to Michael, the director of the museum, and this is obviously a labor of love. The museum attempts to give a brief history of martial arts throughout the world, covering such diverse topics as Hawaiian martial arts (Lua), and martial arts in Hollywood. It covers these by brief (3 minute) but informative videos, great displays and interesting artifacts (from Chinese ""fire wheels"" to the Karate Kid's headband). As small as it is, you could easily spend a couple hours looking through the exhibits, watching the videos and reading the displays. It is definitely worth a trip here.",Lance P
50,Fantastic little museum packed with lots of info!!!,"We had never heard of this museum before, but a Groupon came up for $9 for a family for four so we decided to go. We thought it was fantastic, and we all had a great time. There was only one other family there when we came and they were leaving so we had the museum all to ourselves. There were displays on each Martial Arts form, where it came from, and how it originated, so we also learned some history in the process.It was well worth the price, and, had I paid full price I still would have thought it to be a great deal. For someone who knows nothing about martial arts, but just wanted to learn, and expose my children to something new, it was very informative, and enjoyable.",travlinfamily1
40,Cool Spot,This is a cool spot with some knowledge and history. I like it because it's nice and quiet and gives you a chance to learn about martial arts.,ceohector
30,"A little small, but I like the effort.","Burbank seems an odd place for a Martial Arts History Museum. The location is a little small, but they try to pack a lot in. They have costumes and weapons and videos from many kinds of martial arts. There is also a movie section, of course, showing martial arts in movies, with some posters and props.I enjoyed seeing the different cultures' weapons, but I would have liked to learn more about the style of fighting. How is Tae Kwon Do different from Judo, for example. It could have been more informative. It's a good start, however.",Ryan D
30,It's a cool start but needs more museum material,I came in at around 1pm. Most of the information that they presented are already available out there. Some museum pieces have been donated by well-known martial artist that gives credibility to their collection. I would like to see more museum pieces in the future and kudos to the people that created this museum for the martial arts.,Neil N
50,The only one in the world!!!,"If you're ever in Burbank, Martial Artists and Non-Martial Artists alike will enjoy and benefit from a visit to this unique museum. Curator Michael Matsuda is friendly, and happy to answer questions about the museum.",dbrgdmn
30,"Comprehensive overview, but not enough real action.","This museum has been open for 10 months and I don't think many people know about it yet. It's a small building on Magnolia that I only noticed driving by when they had their Grand Opening sign out. My husband and I bought a deal from Living Social when it came up. Regular admission is still very reasonably priced.We went on a Sunday afternoon and were the only people there. The museum is divided into sections by country and covers the different styles of martial arts and cultural dance in each area. There are costumes/uniforms and also weapons displayed. The displays are less historical artifacts and more reproductions, which the manager said are all donations. Each section also features a video on a small screen that gives an overview of the country's culture.The thing that I really felt was missing was a demonstration of the differences between the styles. It's one thing to read about it, but I didn't truly understand how each form looked. The videos only show brief snippets. I wanted to see more of the unique movements and weapons demonstrated.The museum holds an array of events listed on their website from cultural, dancing, and fighting exhibitions. I would really like to attend one of these. But I think you should be able to experience the martial arts in the displays without having to also go to an event.The manager was very friendly and clearly has a passion for the collection and the events. He was eager to answer any questions.If you live in Burbank, I'd definitely recommend a visit. Plan to spend about an hour to an hour and a half. I'm hoping this museum will continue to evolve with the support of the community.",Trysta B
