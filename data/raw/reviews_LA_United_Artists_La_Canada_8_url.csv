40,Very comfortable theatre,"This is a great theatre with large reclining, comfortable chairs. There is lots of free parking available and no mall traffic to deal with.

40,We took our granddaughters to see a children's movie here,"This is close to our house and to a couple of good places to eat. It is what I think of as a ""date movie theater"" with very comfortable chairs which recline. It is also very expensive. I miss the old theater which was much more affordable but people are well behaved here and the staff is very pleasant.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendy4413

40,COMFORTABLE ENOUGH FOR A GOOD NAP,Theater was remodeled a couple of years ago with great fully reclining chairs. Very accommodating staff and a decent variety of food. Alcohol is also available if you really want to nap. Theaters themselves are usually clean but the lobby could use some TLC. Our first choice for a theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EPSTAMPER
40,Great seats,"Great seats, love that you can select your seating. Very pleasant staff at concessions, but like all movie theatres overpriced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlsierra22
40,The Meg,"Went to the show with my husband and two grandchildren (10 & 8). We ordered tickets and selected our seats from home using the Fandango application. Parking is free with plenty of spaces and checking in was seamless.Popcorn and drinks were overpriced as they are in all movie houses. Theater was clean, well maintained and the reclining seats were super comfortable. Love going to this theater because it is close to home and the staff is really nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trailbiter
50,Good place to see a movie,"A relaxing place to get away from the sun’s rays, and to watch a movie. Comfy seats, good refreshments, and good service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
10,Sticky sticky sticky,"The concessions are overpriced,. But the floors are so sticky you will swear they mop the floors with coco-cola and not soap and water, are the seats even clean?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Scuba2214
40,great,"love to see movies here. it is very convenient for us to get to, parking is usually uneventful and just live the pick movies and seats online. they do need to have someone go through seats and identify wonky seats and fix and they started real well sort of real food alternatives than popcorn and nachos. overall good place to see a movie",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/64patrica
40,"Easy parking, great theater","This theater has great movies and I like their new seats that tilt back. But best of all, I love that there is always plenty of parking and it's free. Right next door is a Starbucks, a restaurant and a Goldsteins Bagel so you can get a snack or meal without travel and parking. I'm done with theaters with paid parking so this is a good one stop shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mnkbrown
50,Great Local Theatre,"I've recently moved to the area and was thrilled to find this theatre near my house. Always with current films, great prices and wonderful seats. No need to go out of my own zip code!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/510kerryg
40,Reserve your seats now!,"The huge recliners are great and you get to pick your seats ( assigned seating). Popcorn is always fresh, too. Not sure why they now sell wine and beer...Going to the movies is exspensive anywhere now, so be prepared to pay. Older folks may not like the new, modern seats and having to look way up at the screen. The state of the art sound could also be too loud for them. Might be better if they stay home so you won't have to listen to them complain. Overall a great theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/teddyb1968
40,A nice local movie theatre,"I love to see movies, all kinds of movies, at least one a week. I like to see movies in nice movie theaters, sitting myself back, watching pictures while eating snacks. I have been to almost all the movie theaters in LA area. This is a relatively small theatre with pretty small cinemas. However, it has almost everything a theater must have. The reclinable chairs makes it so cozy especially in a cold rainy day. The best time to see movie for this theatre is in the morning since it is less crowd and easy to select the best seat. Since it is local, I have visited quite often and love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laonannan
50,it's Gone Upscale,"Theaters are now smaller and have the great comfy reclining chairs. They serve food, wine, beer, etc. More upscale and you can book your seats online. There are also a few restaurants, a Starbucks and a Hamburger joint if you don't want to eat theater food in the complex.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingRealtor1
30,Nice but pricey,"Comfortable reserved seats and first run movies. But it's $12 for seniors in the afternoon, so will not return. Concessions are also very expensive.We would rather go to a great mostly foreign film theater in Pasadena to get really interesting movies at far more reasonable prices. Try Lemmles (sp?)But if you don't mind paying up to $16 a seat to see the newest flicks this one works. The theater is kind of tucked in below intersection of two freeways. Parking is excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rockdocker
20,Despite fancy seats...not a good theater,"This theater installed fancy cushioned reclining seats, but the experience of seeing a movie there is still not good. It does not have stadium seating...the auditoriums are flat. The screens are smaller than other movie theater screens and are set up high, so one has to look UP at the screen. Projection of the film seemed to lack detail...I get a better picture on my HDTV!The fancy reclining seats had a problem if you attend the theater with more than one other person...the seats are paired up two by two with gaps between the pairs. I attended the movie with my wife and her eldery mother...she sat next to her mother while I, although I was sitting next to her, had to endure a gap between our seats...I did not like sitting away from my wife!This theater also has that annoying practice of making you choose specific seats at time of ticket purchase...that practice might be OK for Saturday Date Night, but for the rest of the week and especially matinees it's silly, unnecessary, and annoying!They show 20 minutes of previews...five minutes more than most theaters...a little too much!I would of had a better time waiting for the movie to come out on DVD, enjoying it on my clear and detailed HDTV and in my recliner. The $60 we spent there (including food) was not worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rogerdob
50,Best local theater,The two best things about the UA La Canada 8 theater are 1) reserved seating that you can choose yourself and 2) huge armchair seats that recline with a leg rest just like a Lazy Boy recliner. Bring a wrap to keep you cozy and you're all set. The popcorn is fresh. Parking is just outside and free. Close to Montrose area where there are lots of different restaurants and shops.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sandy_from_LA
50,Great Movie House,"This movie house is a very relaxing one as they have a reserved and reclining seats. You can buy tickets at the theatre box or online (Fandango and their website among others). But if you really want to save, just buy the ticket at your local Costco(if you have membership) I am not just sure if you have to pay surcharge at the box office if you use those costco regal cards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/La_pinoy
50,Comfy Seatrs!!!,Nice theatre with the best comfy seats ever - so spacious and recline. You choose your seats when you get your tickets so go early to purchase and come back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/julial3054
40,NICE LOCAL MOVIE THEATRE,"It's local and convenient. The seats have been upgraded to expensive leather home theatre seats. Very comfortable. I gave it a four as the ambiance is very dated but, who cares; it's the movie that counts. Plenty of free parking to boot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SHYBOY2014
40,Convenient and clean,"This UA is convenient for local residents and right off the 2 freeway. The movies shown are very mainstream, so to see edgier or independent films we have to go elsewhere. But all the theaters at UA have the wide reclining seats now. Because of the deluxe seats there are fewer seats per theater so it can be hard to get a ticket for a popular movie. Took us three weeks to get decent seats for Jason Bourne on a Saturday night.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainew196
40,Reserved seating and comfortable oversize recliner seats,"when the UA remodeled an opted for Reserved seating and comfortable oversize recliner seats, it made it an infinitely better option ,Being tall I vowed to go there previously as their seats we cramped and hardly comfortable for someone of my height.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marktS5189DV
50,"Comfy Seats, Great Service!",It is like being in your own easy chair and watching a movie on a really big screen. The ushers are very polite and kind. Popcorn is great. The only annoyance is that the chairs are so comfy that you get sleepy. Bring a coke with your popcorn and you'll be set.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karynb627
20,Clean the floors,"While the ability to choose your reclining seats is a huge plus, the poor maintenance of all public areas is a disgrace. How hard is it to vacuum the concession area?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taliny
50,Excellent Theater,"We love the UA La Canada, they have upgraded all theaters' chairs to recliners, which are wide and very comfy. They have an expanded menu from most theaters, and serve wine and beer. However, the wine is served in plastic glasses, which I hate, and costs about $10, fairly expensive for a plastic glass of wine, I think. I have not tried the beer so can't comment on that, although they seem to have many choices. The theater books their seats on Fandango, so you can buy your seat ahead of time, then arrive just as the movie starts, getting your favorite seat every time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparkyW22
40,Love the first-class seats!,"This has been my local theater for several years now. But when they switched to reserved tickets with the extra comfortable reclining lounge seats, it became my favorite. I buy my tickets through Fandango, have them sent to my phone via text then I show the ticket taker my phone when we arrive. So easy!Recently they also added wine to their menu. Unfortunately, like all move theater fare, it is ridiculously expensive so I refuse to buy it.I would give this theater an excellent rating if the women's room was better kept. There have been broken soap dispensers and faucets that took months and months to repair.Parking is ample and fairly easy to deal with.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/6Quinns
50,They have the best seats.,They have the best seats. They are like lazy boy chairs but the price is the same. Way better than Arclight. The staff if pretty slow though.......,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karinmfcc
30,Adult style seating.,"Adult style seating, good movies seen BUT Nothing new in concessions IETacos, hot dogs, sausages, wrap sandwhiches, smoothies ( bottled), coconut water, juices, Wine for adults?(show ID for those under age).More can be done.One must reserve seating due to limited seating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/spacetourist
40,"Chairs look comfy, but not so","Pros: Because of the large recliner seats the theater seats fewer and is more intimate.Con: Despite being recliners, they aren't too comfortable, but perhaps would be if you are a large person.Caution: Many break-ins to cars in the lot. Choose your space carefully.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/223JaniceP223
50,So Comfortable!,"Reclining seats; what more can you ask for? This is a great, small movie theater. Book your seats online. Choose seats toward the back or you're pretty close. Good concession and reasonably priced tickets. Loved it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cammie10101005
40,Improved seating,The new reclining seats make the experience much more pleasant. The concession stand offers all your need. Plenty of parking space available around the theater.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/armen120
40,New Home Theater Look,"I have been to this theater a couple times a year for the past couple decades. They completely remodeled the inside with individual cushy chairs and assigned seats. As always, try to avoid the first two rows. The privacy of a comfortable chair and separation for other theater patrons is a real plus. Same old theater food, snacks and entrance lobby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/220JamesW
40,$2 popcorn Tuesdays and reclining seats,"A great theatre, situated in a small mall with eateries. The seats recline and you have space between your seat and the one next to you. I go on $2 popcorn Tuesdays. Parking is free and circles the movie theatre. The employees all seem fun and efficient. The bathroom is clean and I've never had a problem. Located just up the hill from Montrose and a lot of great restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/S25CVannes
50,Great reclining reserved seats,"Love the reserved seats that super recline! Popcorn was very tasty and the theater was very clean, free parking with restaurants within walking distance",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelshooter71
