50,From George Vreeland Hill,"This place lives up to its name.Great drinks and a great staff.You can't beat the decor and the experience.To me, it's the best bar/club in Culver City.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
40,Unexpected,"We found this place through internet and decided to give it a go.For starters,we should have been more casually dressed.The first feeling for us,that we are Europeans,was that we were in a movie set!The jukebox,the bar with the signs and of course the billiard(pool).The music was rock,90s and more!We were like a fish out of the water in the beginning but eventually we blended in and made some interesting acquaintances!This place is a hung out place for the locals and everyone new its other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eri_Bitz
40,Iconic Culver City Dive Bar,"My wife and I had time to kill after the Sony Studio tour and before dinner with friends in Marina Del Rey. We asked the GPS for a nearby nar and the Cozy Inn came up a mile away from us (not a mile from Sony).The outside looked ""questionable"" but the parking BMWs and Lexus, and Benz told a different story.Full bar, well made drinks and a good price. And a friendly place.One drink there and we were off to dinner, We'll be back again but its 40 miles away.Need to transplant this place to my neighborhood but the city council will never go for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763rays
