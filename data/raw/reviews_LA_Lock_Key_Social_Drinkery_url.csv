40,Tomahawk is a must!!!,"My wife and I decided to try this restaurant who’s gotten rave reviews about their Tomahawk steak. As expected, it was great. I just hoped they had A1 sauce as I’m used to eating steaks with it. But they had Worcestershire sauce, which was ok.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judenv
20,"Horrible service, good drinks, okay food.","Our first drink order was taken quickly and after our dinner orders were placed we never saw our server again. Our steak was over cooked, but we were never given the opportunity to let anyone know. We had to flag someone down to order another round of drinks which ended up taking over 30 minutes to arrive. It wasn’t very busy, quite a few employees standing around visiting. The restaurant is incredibly loud and freezing. We will not be returning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peechtearwapist
50,Tasty & Loud,"Very good food, everything I had was high quality, although a little salty, which is to be expected with pub food. The walls are covered with mirrors which makes for a very loud environment, very loud. If I worked there I would have to wear earplugs. We had a tomahawk, steak, very tasty, but overpriced, over a hundred dollars for a steak at a gastropub; too much. The Doc Holliday was very fun and tasty too, with plenty of smokey flavor. Good iced tea, tropical.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imub4ur
40,"Great, but could use more variety","I really like this spot, but the menu is very limited. Either high end steaks or burgers and sandwiches. Only thing keeping it from five stars for me is that lack of diversity, because everything else is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MusicTraveler2
30,Overrated,"Cool looking place. They have chalk art on the walls and the name is on the ceiling with those cool light up letters. I tried a few drinks and nothing was great about them. Also ordered sweet potato fries and French fries. Those were good, but once you got to the bottom of the bowl, the bottom fries were swimming in oil. The service was okay. We started off with a female server, she could use some training. Half of our party was already seated when we arrived, so she came over to our table and asked for our order. My fiance looks at me and asks, what do you want? Before I could answer she says ""I'll give you time to look at the menu"" and begins to walk away. I knew what I wanted, so I stopped her and asked for my drink which they didn't carry. I didn't know this was a craft bar. So a quick look at the menu and I knew what I wanted. Later she seemed very annoyed that one of the people in our party couldn't decide on what to order. Later, it was time for our server to go home so a dude was now helping us. I didn't order anything but he seemed nice. Overall we had a good time but in my opinion its kind of overrated and over priced.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brendacK2526ZL
50,Adult Family Fun,"I came here with my family (7 people) so we ordered quite a bit of food. It was all delicious and we had a great time chowing down.They have low and high table seating. Their high tables have stools so if you have a bad back then I recommend when making reservations you tell them you want low seating. The atmosphere is great but it has low lighting which is nice but not so nice if you’re with older folks who have trouble with low light. I would even want just a bit more light.Food: of course we had to order the Tomahawk ribeye 40oz steak which was our sole purpose for coming here in the first place. We ordered it with asparagus, cheese, glazed potatoes ($124). It was all marvelous. The potatoes and asparagus were on point. I cannot rave about the potatoes enough! A must try! The steak was juicy and tender.As for the other items my family ordered they highly recommend as well.Smoked bacon Mac and cheese ($12)- yum!Calamari ($12)— classic yum!Manimal burger ($16)Pastrami Sandwich ($16)Blackened Salmon ($21)LKSD burger with fried egg ($14)Ohana pork sliders ($12)Dessert: Pillowtalk sliders ($11) these were rich but delicious.We also recommend the tropical tea ($3)Overall the food was great and our bill was pretty heavy at $338!We recommend coming here at least once to give it a try. I don’t think you’ll be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Qness47
40,Nice place,"The food is good, the atmosphere is great. The beer is cold. I ordered the 40 ounce tomahawk ribeye and split it with somebody. Well seasoned but slightly over cooked. It supposed to be dry aged and I question that. Had none of the nutty ness you should get from a dry aged steak. I was assured it was but I still don’t think so. A little pricey but pretty good overall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidByk
50,New Local Hangout,"Besides premium drinks, they have delicious 5 star food as well. The ambiance is a bit dark and suitable for evening and the location is perfect, right in the middle of Downey and lots of other amenities nearby.Their selection of fine bourbon is extensive and some come here just for that. Don't forget about their prime beef as well. A little on the pricey side but it is well worth the price. Check it out today! Reservations are recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fyremaven
50,NO COMPLAINTS!,"We had seen a video of their menu spotlight item, the 40oz. Tomahawk steak. We decided to take the 60 mile drive to check it out. You do need reservations & they highly recommend it because its a small place and it gets pretty crowded late in the afternoon. All the food is a la cart. We went early at lunchtime on a Sunday. Sundays they offer their Brunch Menu as well as their regular menu. My mission was that 40 oz. Tomahawk bone in steak. The steak is pricey ($99) but the meat is high quality making it worth the cost. I ordered the Tomahawk, my kids ordered THE MANIMAL BURGER (Just think bacon, bacon, bacon!) & THE MESS BURGER (Just like it sounds a BIG messy Delicious burger with Hot cheetos, nachos cheese & chorizo) both made with double beef patties, My wife ordered their steak sandwich (thin sliced rib eye & cheese). We also ordered their Duck Face Fries, Amazeballs Brussels & the sweet chipotle wings. EVERY ONE OF US walked out, full, satisfied & content. The service was AMAZING, the food was DELICIOUS, I will definitely come back for round two! Our server was the best, even suggested drinks to compliment our meal. They also have an outside patio if you dont want to sit inside. Keep in mind that they have smaller cuts of meat & a salmon option.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/browneyednenita
30,Tamahawk steak!,The only thing you need to order is the Tomahawk steak! There is no other reason to go there. At least they have a cool vibe of beer and wine...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WineConn
10,Way Way Overpriced Don’t Eat Here !,"$99.00 for a steak? In Downey??? At a beer bar type of setting place???Come on ! And all other food choices way overpriced. Plus, they write in the tip, even if only 2 in a party. How UNPROFESSIONAL.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lawyercef
30,Beer heaven,"excellent variety of beers on draft, but very highly priced. Service was ok, place had not been open for too long, when we visited. They did try hard though",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ingrid651
50,Excellent Food!,"My husband and I shared the 40oz tomahawk steak and it was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My daughter had the smaller 18oz steak and it was great as well. Friendly staff, great drinks, a little pricey but worth every penny!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonic273
50,So delicious & so friendly,"This restaurant lives up to it's hype. The food was phenomenal- we had the candied bacon (yum) to start and burgers and steak sandwich for main. All were mouth-watering delicious. Table next-door were regulars and order the Tomahawk- looked good.Sat outside and people watched early on a Saturday evening. Really friendly, warm, helpful staff. Would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/869sarahjanes
40,"Reservations Required, Pricey but Good","Made reservations 5 weeks in advance. Came in on the day early and were seated right away with no issue. Service was excellentCame to try the Tomahawk 40 oz Rib Eye Steak Bone In. It was huge and easily fed 3. It was cooked perfectly (medium Rare) and served on a sizzling platter. We also had to have the fried cheese that complimented the steaks. We added an 18 oz rib eye to our order so we would have enough. Both steaks was enough with no leftovers for 3 adults a teenager and a 10 year old. We also got an order (bucket) of fries which were good. We tried he Brussel Sprouts, but sent them back as they were overly sweet. The server gladly exchanged this side for the Buffalo Cauliflower. This was really good. We didn't try any of the many brews on tap that was available or any thing from the bar, but the drinks that came out looked good. The 40 oz steak was $115 and the with the cheese, it came up to $136 and then added to all the other food the total was $238 before top. I have had steak at Ruth Chris and thought that the rib eye here was comparable, however a bit more pricey.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sgtgbacon
50,Incredible lunch,"Glad I had the opportunity to discover this place while in town for business. Have to agree the pastrami sandwich was noteworthy setting a standard other sandwiches will have a hard time meeting. The meat was juicy and tender. Even the iced tea was special. Burger looked great, salad with salmon looked good too everyone at our table thoroughly enjoyed their food. You can tell it is crafted to order, isn't the fastest place but it allowed for us to really visit with each other.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeeMarieMM
50,Amazing Pastrami Sandwich,"Thoroughly enjoyed everything! Old Fashioned with the Pastrami was incredible. Also tried the chicken and waffles, Brussel sprouts and candied bacon. All were spectacular and we will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob33Rich
50,Great Food and Great Drinks!!,This place has a pretty cool atmosphere and usually has a crowd. The bartenders are great and pretty attentive. The drinks are well made. The beer selection changes and there is always something interesting on the menu to try. I've tried a few of the appetizers and they're pretty tasty!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalcubanjoe
30,very lovely place,This place is hit n miss. Not a good selection of spirits.. Food is so so and a bit pricey. Went 2 times in 1.5 years. They do though have a great french dip sandwich ..,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bavilesny1
20,Nice place but...,"I live nearby and decided to meet a few friends here for a couple of drinks and something light to eat. I figured why not support local businesses right? The restaurant is dim lit and has a decent sized bar. We were seated right away which is always nice especially since it wasn't busy and during the middle of the week. We placed our orders and got our drinks. We were talking and having a great time when we noticed that our food was taking longer than expected. We tried flagging down the waitress but she was a little busy with another staff member so my friend had to walk over to her to ask about our food. She looked shocked and said I'll check on it for you. At this point we started keeping the time because we were hungry and it took her an additional 30 minutes to tell us ""It's almost ready"". The place is nice but the staff is not well trained to give good service.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/381humbertos
50,Delicious!,I have not been to this restaurant in a few years but I returned a couple weeks ago and I have to say that it has definitely improved. I did not have any food this visit but the drinks were delicious my friend had one of their specialty drinks and I had my usual and the drinks were good and were at a very reasonable price,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299raysan

50,Sooo good!,The candied bacon burger was amazing!!! The beer selection was awesome..loved the pear hard cider! My girls loved the chicken and waffle sliders soooo good!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JennNluis
50,Try and Stop in!,"I saw that this place gets good reviews and I understand why. They have a large selection of beers. I wasn't sure what to choose, but my server gave me a few recommendations and descriptions.The food was also really interesting - you can add a variety of proteins including duck confit. Since I rarely order duck confit (especially at a place as low key as this), I chose the LKSD Salad with duck confit and a side of the meatballs. Everything tasted really good and the portions were just right. If I'm ever driving back through Downey, I'd try to stop in again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCMBAGirl
40,Lock and Key in Downey,"The atmosphere is pleasant with wood and heavy metal dominating the decor. The selection of craft beers on tap is exceptionally good. There are menu items that are quite unusual, but tasty.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/D3973TPmarkw
40,"Great Food, weak cocktails and bad wines","I first want to say I DO love coming here... the ambiance is great which is why I gave it 4 instead of 3. The food is also amazing... among them, the cauliflower buffalo was A-mazing! My friend has one of their cocktails... great tasting, lemony, nice... but NO Alcohol!I had previously (on another occacion gone with a date) and we actually had to return the glass of wine to the bartender... is was that bad!So, for for the food, ambiance and great beer selection... but sadly, not for cocktails or wine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yesiloves2travel
50,Amazing People,"I love this place. We go here quite frequently now because of the amazing people that work there. They're all very friendly, helpful, and great to have a chat with. The drinks are all amazing and the food is great too. I love the Sriracha Ketchup that comes with the fries and the oreo cheesecake is to die for!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaySwift
50,Craft cocktails + Craft beer + Craft kitchen + Attractive bar environment.,"I am a fan. Just go there and you will not be disappointed. Reading the menu alone will probably make you drool. The beer lovers will be in love. The whiskey and craft cocktails are worth a daily visit if you fancy, I do. The staff is friendly and really know their stuff. Come solo, bring a friend, a date, a client...even mom for brunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Danogoggles
50,Fan-dang-tastic!,"I've enjoyed this place twice now, both times around the late afternoon. I love everything about it-from the Pinterest-looking decor, to the name, to the board of beer, to the low-key attitude of our servers. I just really dig the place. I hate being pinned into hurrying my order-both of our servers were eager to please without being overwhelming. When I have servers who don't push me in and out of my table, I love that. Quickly and quietly filling my water when I'm not looking will always secure you an extra tip. Knowing that, yes those amazing duck fries (and they ARE amazing) means I need extra napkins without asking, is also a plus. The duck fries and duck wraps are fantastic-perfect duck, just perfect. The hot cheeto pie was delicious-we really loved the chorizo, the forky pig burger-also wonderful. If you plan on drinking-I mean *really* drinking, bring your coin as you're gonna need it. But for an afternoon of great food and a coupla beers, you'll get out of there no worse than anywhere else.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/224DeborahM
30,New Establishment So Improvement needed,"First I must say that I've been here twice. Both times my food was exceptional! However the service is a bit lacking. Every question I asked about menu items lead my server to return to the kitchen to retrieve the answer. On my first visit I asked for water and the server rudely stated that it was on the table. The water container while very unique and adds to the decor, by the second visit water deposits were visible from dishwashers. So,in conclusion the food was consistently great on both occasions the service personnel needs training!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmelNichelle
10,BEAUTIFUL BAR but TERRIBLE SERVICE!,When one walks in you will find this bar low lit with a feeling of a casual fun bar/restaurant. We visited at night and it was pretty difficult to view our menu that we had to use our iPhone to give us light. Now I dislike writing negative reviews but our experience was not NOT GOOD. Our server took our order for drinks and we waited more than 10 minutes. 10 minutes for drinks? Come on now! $3 for club soda..unheard of. We were told the club soda comes from a bottle and this is the reason why it was $3. I’ve only seen bars/restaurants use fountain club soda and if it comes from a bottle I’m given the bottle. Overall I only saw two servers and 4 bartenders. Won’t be retuning not a good first impression. This restaurant needs training in service.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EL_GQ
