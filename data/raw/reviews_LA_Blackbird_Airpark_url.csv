50,Amazing!,I worked at Rockwell for a bit and I actually saw and HEARD the Blackbird take off...so amazing to see and hear! Nice little park to take the kids to see the planes up close.,L. E. Cox
50,Breath taking,Such amazing plans. Most important was the information on each and every single plan. Each plan has a placket with all information on the plan. Another great part is the airplanes are not fake. They decommissioned plans from our government fleet.,eddiecatalan
50,Blackbird Airpark,Nice place to visit if you are in Palmdale. If your are going to visit Blackbird Air Park try to plan your visit around the open house. That way you can more planes.,bigdady5840
50,A Walk through Aviation History,"I was a kid when an American U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk. This happened in 1960, and the Cold War seemed suddenly to look a lot ""hotter."" It would be hard to overstate the stunning impact of the shoot-down and all that followed, from the show-trial and conviction of the American pilot for espionage to his negotiated release 2 years later in a prisoner exchange for a Soviet spy arrested with a coded message concealed in a hollow nickel.Those days are mostly forgotten today, but you can learn about them and about the Cold War more generally, by visiting the Blackbird Airpark. The first thing you'll see upon entering is a U-2 with an interpretive sign. But wait! You can go inside the small visitor center/gift shop and sit down to watch a video covering the U2 incident and its fallout, using historical film footage and a narration that conveys the gripping character of the shoot-down and the public trial, along with the general tenor of US-Soviet relations at the height of the Cold War. If you care about history, or wonder how we got to where we are now, I recommend you watch this video.The airpark also has two very impressive examples of the now-retired SR-71 Blackbirds that provide its name. You will learn about that formerly state-of-the-art spy plane too in the video presentation, and it is no less gripping than the U-2 sections. The most amazing segment has to do with the 1966 disintegration of an SR-71 while in flight near the edge of space, and the incredible survival of its test pilot, Bill Weaver, who ""awakened"" to find himself falling. His navigations systems specialist, Jim Zwayer, did not survive.It was an odd and unnerving feeling to peer into the SR-71 cockpit and imagine what must have gone on, as the ill-fated plane disintegrated around the two men. What stories these planes must hold!There are other interesting aircraft here -- and some are just beautiful to see, like the great shiny USAF propeller plane that gleams in the sun. You'll come across experimental planes, detached engines and ignition carts with explanations of how they work, and a giant 747 that once carried the Space Shuttle on its back. You'll find the interpretive signs accompanying all the displays easy to follow for those (most of us) who are not aeronautical engineers.I also enjoyed some of the small touches, like seeing the distinctive ""Skunk Works"" emblem on a couple of the planes, as tribute to Lockheed Martin's ADP - Advanced Development Program, which developed secret projects that were largely unfettered by bureaucracy. The ADP is today nearby at Air Force Plan #22 in Palmdale. You can't go there, but you can come here.I've always chuckled about the name ""Skunk Works."" I used to read the old comicstrip called ""Li'l Abner,"" in which the name given to the secret location of the moonshine still was ""Skunk Works."" The emblem is distinctive and amusing, and I think it does convey something important about the value of looking at things differently and not just doing the same old, predictable thing when what you are all about trying to create something new in the world.The airpark isn't big. You can certainly see a lot more planes and equipment at major aviation museums, such as the Smithsonian's Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport or the Museum of Flight in the old Boeing buildings in Seattle. But there is a kind of charm in coming here to Palmdale, where so many experimental flights took off into the unknown. I found it fascinating, as I hope you will too.Highly Recommended.",CarolDM1900
40,Big Planes for Viewing,An interesting place to visit if you like planes. Had a very small display of ‘history’ and a gift shop. Donations accepted and accessible parking. We only walked around the ‘spy’ planes but there were many more to be viewed. This place was recommended for something to do by our hotel.,hoho92649

50,Magical,"If you are an aircraft enthusiast this is a must visit, and if Lookheed spyplanes were a religion this place would be the cathedral. I arrived to the place fully aware that the place would be closed since it was a weekday. I was hoping to take a few pics through the fence. I notoced that the gate to nearby Joe Davies Heritage Airpark was open so I asked if it was alright to park at the gate. They said that they were doing a flag cermony so I was welcome to park inside and see the collection at that museum. When I was inside I told a woman workign there that we had come to see Blackbird park she told me it would be open despite being a weekday because some students were going to visit. All told a wonderful visit to both the Blackbird Airpark and Joe Davies Heritage Airpark. The wonderful planes and the warm welcome really made my day. In the distance you can see Skunkworks plant where they all came from. The collection includes a D-21 drone, A-12, SR-71 and a U-2.",Resepappa

50,Amazed,"I lived in the AV on and off for 20+ years. I have driven by at least a thousand times and saw the planes but knew nothing about the back story of what they really were besides cool. So I decided to take my kids at that point they were 6 and 4. We learned so much about the missions they flew about the pilots and the purpose of each single, plane,jet,bomber etc. Rhe only downside is that it was a windy cold day so they really rushed the tour and it was noticeable. Other than that it was an amazing experience. I highly recommend you stop by",Deepsteve1

50,Blackbirds and More,The Blackbirds are parked outside so you can see them from the street and can park next to the fence if you don't get to the opening on Fri-Sun.

50,Phenomenal Aircraft,"The Blackbird Airpark is the only place in the entire world where the public can see Lockheed SR-71 and A-12 aircraft side-by-side on display. The park is where my son completed his Eagle Scout service project (to refurbish the benches and planters) a couple of years ago, so we spent a lot of time getting to know the aircraft and the people who run the facility. They are very knowledgeable, and helpful with many historical facts about aviation throughout the Antelope Valley. There is no admission charge, and the park is generally open weekends, but you can drive-by and see from outside the fence 24/7. Donations are accepted inside the visitor center.",travelguy537

For those that don't know, the A-12 was the first in a series of 4 model of aircraft, culminating in the SR-71 that so many know. While I was disappointed to find that they were only open on Friday and Saturday (I was there on a Thursday) I was sufficiently satisfied to pace along the wrought iron fence and grab pictures from every angle possible.

40,Two Airparks Here...Nice...Both Free,"There are actually two airparks here, both free, side by side but with separate parking. The Blackbird airpark is very small and the entrance is off the road into Edwards AFB. There are three aircraft, a drone and a missile. There is an A-12, an SR-71, and a U-2. A quick 10 minutes will allow you to see all. Then drive next door (entrance on Avenue P) to the Joe Davis Heritage Airpark where you see all the jets. This park is very clean with a nice walking path past more than a dozen planes and missiles, including various jets and the two newest most impressive aircrafts, the 747 space shuttle transport and the massive B-52 Stratafortress. Expect to spend about 30 minutes to enjoy all of these aircrafts and read the detail placards. Very nice and easy to reach. The park is a short 5 minute drive off CA 14 on Avenue P. There are not any good signage marking the way so be sure you know where you are going. There is also a nice small gift shop at the Blackbird airpark and nice restrooms.",Tennessee50plus
40,"Wow, top secret history!",For years these planes didn't exist. They were some of the secret things moving out of Palmdale at night and base workers were mumNow there they are. This technology is pretty old so you wonder what secret stuff is flying out of the Skunk works now?,vintagetrailer
50,Blackbirds rock!,Fantastic tour today of the Blackbird Airpark and adjourning Joe Davies Heritage Airpark!!! Definitely try to arrange a guided tour of the SR-71s when you come: the first-hand commentary really brings the story of these planes to life. I spent three hours between the two adjacent outdoor facilities and I hope to visit again sometime.,Kim
50,Grandsons Favorite place,You must take the time to see this piece of history at least once. We took out 4 1/2 year old grandson right before Christmas. He was mesmerized by the size of each display. He now wants to be a pilot. What a wonderful piece of history in our own back yard!,Karen B
50,a fascinating collection,We had visitors from Europe anad we took them to Blackbird park. They were amazed at being able to get up close to the AR-71 and had the opportunity to actually speak to one of the pilots of the plane. It was a major highlight of their trip to the Desert.,Robert P
50,Great day...tons of history,Be sure to check in at the office. Actual B-2 pilot (retired) was there and you can take photos in the pilots seat.,Sean-Debi
50,KB,"Not as big as some air museums but meticulously maintained walkways, planes and signage. Great thing is how each plane and pilot was associated with the Antelope Valley. They have plenty of room so hope it expands.",Kyle B
50,Small But Fascinating,"Normally I don't like planes, trains and automobile exhibits, but the Blackbird Airpark is an exception. Just the right size ... not overwhelming. I think it would be interesting for kids.",CacheOn
50,Not just Blackbirds for free,"They added numerous planes since they first opened. Besides that Blackbirds, unusual planes include 747 Space Shuttle carrier, B52D. Amazing to see and touch them for free.",Volvodadfast
30,small,not much to see but my son loved being able to see the planes up close. whole thing only took 10 min.s,joker198618
50,Very fun,I love seeing all of the planes. The park is kept clean and the airplanes are in great shape. It is awsome to walk under a B-52.,Ted J
40,"Pretty cool, for another ""static"" display!","Normally,being a aviator my whole life, collections of old airplanes sitting around the desert would not be something I'd enjoy spending hours observing.This was a bit of a pleasant surprise, though, because it included a couple of more unique features.First, they had a retires USAF Test Pilot (including the SR-71) hanging around the Gift Shop to tell stories and answer questions. That was pretty cool, considering how few those pilots were!Second, they not only had the CIA version of the SR-71 on display (the A-12), but they had the B747 that piggy-backed the Space Shuttles, too! Pretty cool to see a one-of-a-kind like that!",Chris Q
50,Just fantastic,So exciting to see up close these rare aircraft and to read the stories behind them.Well presented with clean restrooms and a good shop with friendly and knowledgeable staff.Free to enter and lots of parking but great to give a donation to keep it going!Right next to Milestones of Flight Air Museum.,glamourpuss1000
40,Excitind Airpark,Exciting group of planes and engine examples to get up close too. Community does adopt a plane activities there too with middle and high school groups. Not open all days so check hours.,Koachm
50,A must see!!,"We went there as a family and it was very cool!! There are many type of aircraft that are worth seeing, some even historical! We had a great time taking a FREE tour through the Blackbird park!",Krista C
50,Up Up and away.,Did you ever dream of being a bird and flying with the wind? When I see and touch the plans on review at the Blackbird airpark that is exactly how I feel. What a wonderful place to visit.,johndisepio
50,Got to see it.,"Great for aviation nuts. Lots of history, small gift shop, easy access. Right next door to a great airpark with lots of planes. Great for young and old alike.",Steve J
50,Awesome park!,I have always taken out of state visitors to this park. The collection of planes has improved tremendously. It's a must see especially if you are living in AV. They have some park benches to have a picnic there. The place is very clean. The volunteers have done an amazing job with the collection of planes. Kudos to them!,eldreyes
50,Educational and Fun,My youngest brother and husband are huge plane fans. So many planes to study and they each have something to teach you! I love it.,travelkatt23
50,Cool jet exhibit,"Lots of information for the lay person, but airplane geeks would love it. And it's free. Friendly, informative staff and you can take it all in at your leisure.",LyndaKS
50,it's free and a must see!,"if you are an aviation buff, this is a must see - no cost to you, a nice comfortable, relaxing couple hours to stroll around and look at the aircraft - a newest addition - the NASA 747 that carried the space shuttle. There is a small gift shop too.",Annette H
40,Hidden airplane gem in Palmdlae,Not really hidden its Ave P and 25th East. Lots of restored jets and SR-1 and B52. Worth going out of your way to visit. Can walk up close to most of the planes.,Gerald P
40,An unexpected treat!,We drove past this museum when it was closed but made a special trip back to see the shuttle carrier up close.Its a lovely museum with many aircraft to look at and get close to.It was amazing to see something which has a part of aviation history up close.,munchkin1150
40,Blackbird Park,Really cool to see the two Sr-71 Blackbirds up close. The only place I have ever had a chance to view the Sr-71 drone as well. A dozen or so other aircraft to look at including an F-14 Tomcat and a B-52. If you are lucky you may get to see an aircraft or two takeoff from the runways of the Palmdale Airforce Test facility home of the famous Lockheed Skunk Works.,Mark D
50,Check the hours they are open but well worth the trip!,"OK, it is not a HUGE park but it is one of the few places in the U.S. where you can see a Blackbird for free! Yes, they don't charge so quit complaining about the hours they are open.They are located on Ave P East of Division several miles on the North side of the street.I am not a fanatic about Air Force history so I can't tell you which planes are there but just go and listen to the other tourists. This one guy who lives in the area goes there often and spouted off each planes designation, top speed, operating ceiling, historical significance, which plane succeeded which model, fuel capacity....So just go anytime, you can still see them from the road and through the chain link fence. They even have the shroud off an engine on the SR71 (Blackbird) and it is cool to just know the U.S. created such a fantastic plane!",Robert C
40,Great viewing from outside the fence,Unfortunately we weren't here when the park was open so all we could do is look through the fence at the planes. There was quite a variety and we were surprised to find them in this out-of-the-way location. We hope to be passing through on a weekend so we can go inside and read about what we saw. It is well kept.,Ellen4719
40,B52's F14's and the SR-71 - A wild ride from the past!,"Blackbird airpark is simply the coolest place for the aviation buff and specifically if you are a fan of the SR-71. Sitting right there are the original A-12 (CIA) designation and the first SR-71 (Air Force) that set world speed records back in 1964 of Mach 3.3! That is LA to NY in just 59 minutes . . and that was 50 years ago!!Throughout the air park you will everything from Sabre jets, Star fighters, an F14 Tomcat and even a B52 Bomber!! If you are fan of military aircraft the Blackbird Air Park is a must see attraction. The Air park is free to enjoy, although they rely heavily on donations to acquire and restore old aircraft. If you are traveling through Palmdale, CA this is a must see attraction!",Dwayne R
50,"Love SR-71's, This is Your Park","Get up close and personal with the BlackBird Spy Planes. This is one of the first places we came to visit when we first moved to the area.We were fortunate and were there at one of the anniversaries and got to sit in one of the planes for a picture taking. What an awesome experience. Even got autographs from some of the pilots that flew the planes!They keep adding to the park continually; it has expanded nicely in the last 10 yrs.If you are a plan buff, this is one you Must See!",Katy0701
30,View through the fence,"From what I could see through the fence, nice collection. You would think they would open earlier than 11am on a Saturday for people traveling through.",Sargewolf
40,Vintage Aircraft,The park and trails are well maintained. There is a virtual history of military aviation on display for everyone to see. You can truly get up close and personal with the aircraft that helped our country remain the land of the free.,hek1122
40,Nice Outdoor Air Museum,"Interesting assortment of aircraft, but the 2 SR-71's at the front of the place really caught my eye. It is unusual to see two aircraft plus the engine display all in the same place. The gates were closed when we arrived, but you could still get a good look from the road. Worth seeing.",Peter D
50,a different place,"if you like airplanes, this is the place. my cousin must visit this place everytime he is visiting us. they sure have added many more planes. very interesting.",kylesgram
50,Hours,We were only able to see the planes from the outside of the fence. The hours are Friday- Sunday 11am-4pm. It looked like they had a good collection.,Mamapilot
30,Unless you are a SR 22 Blackbird fan and never seen/been to an aircraft display/military museum don't waste your time,This park is outside an USAF testing facility. It is nice set up but very small about a dozen or so planes. I did not interact with the volunteers because my wife and i went when the place was closed but we were able to see everything and get some decent pics. I do not recommend this place unless you will be in Palmdale for 24 hours or more and you are a big military historian or love military aircraft . This park has so much potential. I would not go out of your way to see this place. This is your typical military display outside of a military installation nothing more nothing less. This would be good for children under 15 or Cold War Veterans.,jdreynoldsjr
