50,Great Experience at Demo Flight,"I came to check out the demo flights they offered when they were at Brackett Airfield. I was able to hop onto a flight which they were offering that day. To my surprise, the ride was really smooth and comfy thanks to the captain seats each passenger had. I got to know the company a little more by talking to some of the people working there. I can't wait for this service to get up and running! The idea of commuting across LA avoiding all that traffic by flying is a dream I feel many have had",Matthew
50,Good experience LA air tours,I have been always wanting to have an air tour and Birds Eye View experience of the LA. I found out Float provides air tour service so i just went to the website and book the tour. I would definitely recommend it! The price was actually reasonable and I went with my husband. I just can't believe how pretty the LA it is when we look at it from the air. We actually want to do it again for our 20 years anniversary!,jas y
50,FLOAT Trip to Big Bear,This is the next big form of transporation and I think people don't realize how big of a deal this is. I recently went with FLOAT and took a trip to Big Bear with them. We flew over to Big Bear airport on a cloudy/sort of rainy day at Brackett Field. After taking off we were above the clouds and the beautiful San Gabriel mountains peaked full of snow. Upon arrival to Bear Bear we flew over the lake and I could see Snow Summit. We landed and at the restaurant at Big Bear airport. You can tell the restaurant waiters that you flew in on FLOAT and I think they'll give you a small discount.,TheNextBigThing
