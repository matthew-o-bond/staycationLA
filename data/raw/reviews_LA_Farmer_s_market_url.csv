40,Whittier farmers Friday market,"Kinda of small like two rows,after you go a couple of times it seems like nothing changes.But still pretty cool (4stars) just skip a couple of weeks and itâ€™s seems better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/577victoro
30,Disappointingly small,"Hadn't been there for a while so was hoping it got better since it was still there. But unfortunately, it was still very small with hardly any fruit/vegetables.The bread person was still there which was the main reason for going. Love their jalapeno/cheddar bread. It was a bit more expensive than before and for a loaf of bread, a tad on the high side. But I guess they have to pay for their space...Tried the tacos this time as well but the meat was a bit too salty for my taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GHQTravels
50,Wonderful vibe,"Lots of local farmers, I bought some best ever apricots, all of the farmers are grateful and appreciative.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/713timt
30,small farmers market but great food vending,"There are not many farm goods here, adequate but it's a great lace for Friday dinner with many food venders,mostly Mexican food.Very popular spot on the downtown city plaza Friday nite 4-7pm in Watsonville,many families with a nice friendly atmosphere .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12megh
50,FARMERS & FOOD,"In the City Plaza every Friday afternoon, a large choice of prepared food items, beautiful flowers, and fresh seasonal produce. Good eats and take out. Interesting people watching, a place to meet up with friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lowell159
30,No Real Value,"After attending two times in the last month, I found the farmers market very depressing. I have attended other farmers market where a variety of local produce, food and some arts and crafts. Watsonville offer food, food and more food. The Arts and Crafts are of lesser value if one was going to Alavera St in LA or TJ. The offerings are limited and of no value. While the food is fair at best they do sell Flowers and trinquets. The city or committee needs to take a hard look as to what they are trying to accomplish. Its nothing better that a low grade flea market. I will not be going again for some time. I feel the current market is doing a dis service to our city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosebroker
50,Friday Market Day,"I love going to the Friday market. I especially love going to the fish stand where the fish is of high quality and very fresh. There is a great selection and the vendor is very helpful in choosing the right amount of fish to purchase. Sometimes they prepare fish so you can taste their wares. The other vendors offer many good products such as organic produce, baked goods, flowers, and prepared food. It is all good!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaJ891
40,"Small, but enough variety","Whittier's Farmers Market held in Uptown is much smaller now then it was in years past. However, it still has a variety including breads, vegetables, fruits, flowers, honey, oils, plants, and some ethnic specialties as well.

50,Best Farmers market,"Whittier farmers market is truly one of the best i have been to. There are so many vendors. The local businesses come out to the market to promote. Sometimes the chiropractor come out and give massages. this farmers market is kid & dog friendly. My favorite item to get at the market are hummus, tons of different types of mushrooms and berries. During the winter there are less vendors, but in the summer it gets super packed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toshinacrockett

40,Farmers' market in uptown,"Farmers' market in uptown always has a nice selection of fresh, in season vegetables and fruits. It is unhurried and casual.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatherineS409
20,More vender equals more options,Could use more venders. It is very small with limited items no cooked items for purchased just produce. Not what I was expecting I was there probably for about 15 mins total. More of a problem looking for a parking spot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritalzrn
