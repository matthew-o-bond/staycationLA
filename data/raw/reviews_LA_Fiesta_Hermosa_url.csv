40,Nice Small time Affair,"Semi annual event here in Hermosa. Has-been greeting more commercial every year. Still some very nice home made crafts. Food is beyond good. So much to choose from. Beer tent along with constant entertainment from bands. Parking will be a problem, however there are shuttle busses from the local high school. Local businesses are also open offering food choices and bars. Rightnect to the beach and pier. The entire area is amazing.",Judpma012
40,"A semi annual fair, that I love and hate!","Fiesta Hermosa is a semi annual fair, that I love and hate! To me the good is seeing all the local people milling around. But there are a lot of the same vendors year after year.",Richard K
50,"Food, Vendors and Fun","Labor Day and Memorial Day weekends the Festival Hermosa is a great experience. Donâ€™t worry about the lack of parking, park at one of their central locations further inland and take the shuttle bus! Quick, clean, convenient! Lots of fun local vendors!",Venture225009
50,Tons of vendors,There was so much to see that we had to go back a 2nd day. Many unusual/unique items. The food court area was extremely crowded and hard to find a place to sit.,Jann G
50,Great fun - something for everybody - Every Memorial Day and Labor Day,"One of the largest, most friendly, fun event you can hope for. Literally hundreds of venders with everything from high end art to inexpensive clothing. Foods from all over the world. Kiddy games and Carnival. 2 stages of live entertainment. A fun Beer Garden. All on Pier Avenue and Hermosa avenue next to the Beach and the dozens of outstanding Restaurants Hermosa Beach offers.",TravDevine
50,Family friendly fiesta,"Twice a year, Hermosa Beach has a very family friendly event with lots of vendors selling things like jewelry, crafts, art, food, candles, soaps, and on and on. There is live music, an enclosed beer garden, and all just steps from the beach. They have shuttles, or you can walk in, but parking there is next to impossible. Lots of fun.",Ruth Houston B
50,Fiesta Hermosa,"The main reason for going to Hermosa Beach was Fiesta Hermosa. Lots of vendors some very good music some good food a farmers market everything crazy you can think of for sale. We spent two days browsing through the items and the vendors booths. It was very interesting, got to relax and listen to some music, enjoyed some wonderful food at some of the restaurants and had a wonderful time.",D4625EHeds
50,Fiesta Hermosa Since 1972,"One of the best experiences of beach life meets Festival. All of Pier Ave and parts of Hermosa Ave are blocked off over Memorial and Labor Day weekends. The streets are packed with booths with art, clothing, games, knick knacks, petting zoo, and rides and games for the kids. AND if you want the local flair, get inside the beer garden with live music. It is a beach scene that is true Hermosa.We go and say we will stay a few hours, which turns into all day. The kids love it and so do we. Always a high light to the start and end of summer at the Beach.",NickellFamilyTravel
