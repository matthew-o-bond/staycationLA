40,"Santa Ynez Canyon, in Pacific Palisades","As a local I have the pleasure of driving through Santa Ynez Canyon, in Pacific Palisades, several times each day & we walk it on weekends. High canyon walls, twisting road & greenery & rock faces on each side. With the recent (Jan / Feb rains weâ€™re even treated to an unusual waterfall. A charming place.
