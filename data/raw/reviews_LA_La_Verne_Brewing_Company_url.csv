30,Beer is so so. Food truck is sketchy.,Had a Groupon for here and was glad we had the Groupon and didn’t have to pay full price for the beer. Online it said they had a food truck there for dinner but when we got there it had already left. It wasn’t even dinner time yet. Disappointed as we came starving. To be fair they do have menus that you can order from and the restaurants will deliver the food to you. Which we took advantage of and ordered a pizza. The brewery also will give you paper plates and napkins.,Beachlover391

40,Lesbian bar,Super fun was there with my man who pointed out that it appeared to be a lesbian bar!!! Hahahahaaa! Still had fun!!! The employees were nice and outgoing the crowd was fun and the music was cool!,393wendyv
40,Quaint little hometown brew house!,"If you're touring local craft beers, you need to stop by LVBC. The beer is high quality and staff is personable and know their beers! Great at recommendations depending on your personal taste. I'm a fan of IPAs so I love the Palomares. My husband likes a lighter beer and B Street is his favorite. I believe these regular taps have won prizes at local brew fests. There are also rotating taps with great flavors to try. I've had the bartender blend a few beers for a delicious, unique beer! Awesome! They're in the process of renovating so I'm sure there are many great things to come!",rachel f

50,Our home brewery,Love the craft beer and the friendly and helpful staff. Wednesday happy hour and food trucks and live music on the weekends. It's kind of out of the way near the airport and the fair grounds but worth the effort to find.,jonpegSoCal
50,Brewing Company,"I was given a gift certificate to this place for my birthday so I took a friend and paid them a visit. First of all, when you first see the front of the place it doesn't appear to be very big. It is located in an industrial building kind of hidden. Once you walk in, you notice a doorway which leads to a larger area of the place. This place has lots of character and a lot of friendly regulars. They also have games, cards etc. you can play. The night I was there they played a trivia game which was a lot of fun! Although my friend and I came in last place we won $10.00!! They don't sell food on a regular basis but on Friday's they do have someone come cook and sell their food. Overall I would recommend this place if you like a variety of beers and friendly people.",Susie R
30,Microbrews for drinking pleasure,A modest brewery located in a small industrial area. The theme is auto racing which is appropriate for the area. The tasting bar is in front and relatively small. The brewery in back has lots of places to sit and is a great place to chill and quaff. Decent beers. An enjoyable experience.,axs666
