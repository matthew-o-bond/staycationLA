50,Fun place,"This is a fun spot, small town museum with loads of history, mostly local and that is the best part. Monrovia was founded in 1887 so there is a lot to see.",Tom
50,Very cool FREE local museum!,"There are supposedly more museums in the US than Starbucks. I'd like to believe that's true, and if one really dives in and explores... it's not that hard to believe. We're always on the hunt to visit new museums and this week brought us to the Monrovia Historical Museum. For a FREE local history museum, they do a great job! This used to be the Monrovia Municipal Pool since WAY back, and when the pool grew too expensive to keep up, rather than destroy the building, they turned it into a museum!There are two wings, which were the women's and men's locker rooms respectively. There are all kinds of exhibits and rooms that show what houses, clothing, storefronts, music rooms, schools and more used to look like. One wing is more devoted to Monrovia history. The other currently has a WW1 exhibit and has a permanent Natural History collection that was donated by the owner when he passed. Even the old wooden boxes that store the items are cool as they are from the 1930s and were made to house the exhibit you're looking at! The telephone exhibit is especially cool.We had our five year old with us and they do have things kids can do. He liked dressing up as a policeman in the police exhibit. You can play with the phones in the telephone exhibit. There are a couple of cool touch boxes in the natural history collection... and even a desk set up where kids can color and play with Lincoln Logs.If you live in LA and are looking for a little day trip... I'd recommend planning a day trip and adding this to your list! You can visit the nearby downtown area by Liberty Park where there ALWAYS seems to be a festival of some sorts going on. There are cuts shops, restaurants and even a very cool antique store. Take a picture with the nearby Mark Twain statue on a bench in the park! Back to the museum... hedge expectations... this isn't Kidspace or The Natural History Museum or Discovery Cube... this is one of hundreds of small local museums... but they do a GREAT job! Visit!",Michael T
40,Local gem,"This is a sweet little museum, and it is free to the public. One wing contains artifacts related to the city of Monrovia, especially the founding fathers. The other wing contains natural and local history, including a large collection of fossils, Native American artifacts, and a really nice WWII display.The building itself is pretty interesting, too, as it was originally built at the town's swimming pool, the Monrovia Plunge.There are stairs leading to the entrance, but an accessible entrance is available around the back.. you'd just need to call or send someone to the main entrance to request access.This is a great little museum, surprisingly detailed for a museum of this size, and relatively (and unfortunately) unknown. The limited opening hours (1-4 on Thursdays and Sundays) makes it a bit challenging to visit, but it is worth it.",Sarah Fe
