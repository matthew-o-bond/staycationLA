10,Mediocre Chicken,"There's a ton of options when it comes to Teriyaki chicken around the area. I've tried several and my recommendation has always been Golden Bowl and Hilo. The Spot just opened up so they're okay, but I'll try them again when I'm in the area since my first experience was extremely mediocre, especially for the price.One star though because it's actually a restaurant, not an ""attraction""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399johnnyk
50,Best Chicken teriyaki in Town,"Small little hole in the wall place with the Best Chicken teriyaki in Town, make sure to add the avocado. You can get different sized bowls and white or brown rice. You wont be disappointed!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UCLABruins22
