Quite amazing that it's an actually functional city hall. Looks great in photos, which is why so many people getting married have their pics taken here. It got to the point it was kind of annoying how many bridal gown trains you'd have to trip over to check out and appreciate the stunning architecture and scale of this place. They now make you get a permit to take photos, which has helped winnow down the crowds. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Pasadena.",Andrew W

50,"Ornate, stately and built to rock and roll","Of all the city halls in Southern California, Pasadena City Hall stands out as being the most beautiful of them all. Built in 1927, Pasadena City Hall exhibits Italian Renaissance and Spanish influences with its red tile roof, ornate fountain, and lush garden courtyard. It is a rectangular building with a spacious court. The east side is a one-story arcade, and the other three sides are three stories high, with towers at each corner and the main dome over the west entrance. The massive dome is six stories tall, and at the top of the dome is the lantern, a column supported cupola 41 feet high, surmounted by an urn and ball. The building has survived several earthquakes over the years, but to make the building more resilient in future events, Pasadena had the vision to make the building more ""earthquake proof"" by retrofitting the building and installing seismic isolation devices separating the structure from the ground and causing the structure to be subjected to smaller forces due to ground motion.",geotech522
50,Gorgeous City Hall,"The City of Pasadena City Hall is beautiful!

During the Christmas holidays, there's a tree and decorations along with seasonal lighting that is beautiful. While a good architectural view during the day, night (especially during holidays) is an especially good view. It is a city hall, so offices are active, this is more for the external design and imagery of the building and the rose garden.

They bring out food trucks and have a blow up screen to watch a movie when it gets dark.

As others have noted, parking enforcement apparently exists to charge out-of-towners with large parking tickets for parking laws that are not posted anywhere to be seen. There are no signs on the street that give notice as to what is expected. Their explanation is that visitors are supposed to be familiar with the Pasadena Municipal Code...I suppose they have to fund the city government somehow, but this approach is predatory and dishonest.",D H

50,How much is there to say about a City Hall exactly? Let's find out...,"I'm really not sure where to even begin with this review! It came up as a place that needed more reviews, but of course that's understandable considering it's the city hall and not a restaurant or hotel! It's actually very pretty with a nice garden. At Christmas there's a big tree lighting ceremony with a large Christmas tree. It's located across from the mall where you get 90 minutes of free parking, so you can always park there and walk over. Directly across from the city hall are two large statues of heads--one of Jackie Robinson and I can't recall who the other is. They're local landmarks and fun for photos, though I'm not sure that they specifically add to the ambiance of the City Hall itself. Would I visit again? Sure, for special events and to let my daughter run around the gardens. Would I go out of my way to see it as a tourist in Pasadena? No.",Loves_Travel_CA

You can walk around the garden and the fountain in the courtyard, go upstairs for some unique views and close up look at the carvings of the building. At the moment, the fountain is turned off so no flowing water like before but it's still beautiful. I recommend walking to the church in the back across the street for some more good pictures.

These classic and in many ways beautiful buildings were crafted the same time as the Rose Bowl and much of Pasadena's best residential architecture. They're free to visit and quite unique.

It's worth a stop to see everyone getting married or taking wedding photos (or paying your overdue electric bill). Good luck finding parking.

50,Pasadena City Hall - Beautiful,I visited Pasadena City Hall on Tuesday morning. I wish I had gone in the evening as I have seen very nice pictures with it lit up. The architecture is breathtaking. The ceiling in the entrance hall is quite lovely as are the floors. The courtyard has a lovely fountain (which was not working) and beautiful rose bushes and other landscaping. I had hoped to go up to the top floor as I had read on here that there was a fabulous view of the mountains. I went up to the 4th floor but there was a sign that the dome was closed. Very disappointing. All in all I am happy that I got to see this beautiful work of architecture. If you are going to be in Pasadena make an effort to visit city hall. Parking is tricky but I was able to park near the back entrance. There are meters $1.25 for one hour.,Sherry W

What you won't see is the impressive neoprene rollers it sits on to save it from earthquake damage. Installing them under a historic structure was a real challenge. Also, the lighting at night really enhances the decoration. Be sure to see it after dark. 2- it is a great example of a civic structure for a small town that began with great aspirations and a highly cultured early population. There is a perfection of scale and monumentality, a reluctance to overreach, and an expression of elegant humility that I never get tired of.",Ann G

50,Winter in L.A.,"Strolling around the Pasadena civic center on a “winter-afternoon” may show some of what made the City of Angels famous just 70/60 years ago. Palms and blooming trees amidst “old world” bell towers and a monumental City Hall inspired by Palladio and Papal Rome.The white façade glowing in the afternoon sun and some slightly snow covered mountains in the background and everything so clean. One feels an urban spirit and a lot of citizen pride here. Virtues, for me still felt in Pasaden more than anywhere else in the L.A. area.Leaving the picture perfect backdrop behind and walking down Union Street turned out a nice contrast to – for me – slightly disappointing “Paseo Colorado”.On a sunny, winter-afternoons “Old Pasadena” is one of the better little urban walks you can take in L.A.",Walter S
40,Picturesque,Drive up and take a picture in the front. If you want to park (parking is a nightmare around City Hall) and go inside the courtyard is also beautiful. I suggest just driving getting the iconic shot and moving on unless you see a parking spot.,msa23_2000
