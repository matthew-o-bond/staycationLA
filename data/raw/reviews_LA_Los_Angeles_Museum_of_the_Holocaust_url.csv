40,Just wish I'd had more time to appreciate the exhibits in this important museum.,"I have always had a historical interest in the Holocaust and have visited numerous museums and monuments to this horrific period in relatively recent history, including visits to the Auschwitz and Dachau Concentration / Death Camps. So when I stumbled across the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust when visit the Pan Pacific Park I just had to take a look. Sadly I only had about 45 minutes spare and so I had to rush around which was a real shame as the museum looked very well done with some interesting exhibits. Obviously it is a museum that you visit with sadness and one that evokes emotion but people need to understand and learn about these terrible acts on humanity. For me one of the poignant articles was the soiled and tattered Concentration Camp Uniforms... There are many powerful photographs that are distressing and could offend the young so whilst I encourage parents to teach their children about this time in our history I recommend that parents exercise caution and maybe 'guide' their youngsters around the museum. Entry was free but donations are suggested, and deserved. I hope to visit again one day when I have more time to take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
50,Excellent museum of its kind.,Amazing museum. Tons of information with well trained docents. Excellent exhibition on Kindertransport. Always difficult museums to visit but in this day and age important,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shazjhb2016
50,Powerful and moving experience,"This is a grim reminder of the cruelty and insanity of man. You cannot walk through here and not deeply feel the pain of these people who were caged, experimented upon and killed. The experience is visceral and very emotional. The pictures and exhibits are real and you almost feel like you are there in the camps. Wow!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H3854JXmikes

50,International Holocaust Remembrance Day,"We attended the program last night at the museum. The seating area was very limited and we were unable to see the speakers but we could listen. In the meantime we wandered through the exhibits. If you don't have a chance to visit other museums like the one in DC or actual sites in Europe, do take the time to come. I've visited numerous sites in Europe including a trip to Poland last year where I went to Auschwitz, Krakow and Warsaw where many atrocities occurred. Many of the exhibits reminded me of the things I have seen in Europe including a visit to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Last words...never forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lcb5310
50,Please Visit And Never Forget.,"We took the audio tour as though walking through time. It is unfathomable what people can do to each other, and even more astounding the resilience of the survivors of the holocaust. We learned so much from our visit, and leaving away with the sense of knowing that what has transpired in the holocaust should never be forgotten.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moonlight
50,LA Museum of Holocaust (Speaker Tour),"We had an excellent speaker, Albert Rosa, 95+ years old!! He spoke for over 1.5 hours to our group about his story as a survivor of Auschwitz. The Museum was fascinating and overwhelming. Definitely a highlight!!! Our 13 year old, studying the Holocaust was enthralled. The piano is the largest artifact remaining from a Holocaust family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelinghappygirl

50,INCREDIBLY MOVING,"For anyone who is interested in the HOLOCAUST this is a must see. When we went there were lectures, things to see, and in my case others to talk to who had lost relatives in the holocaust. Can get quite emotional. An Excellent place to go to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flyer780991
40,Beautiful building and engaged staff,I spent a couple of hours here on a recent business trip and did the docent tour as well.

50,A must see !!!,"We were on our last day of our holiday and were advised to visit the farmer market where we had a great lunch and wonder around the shops. We looked on trip advisor for any attractions near-by and found the museum was within walking distance, what a find! The museum is clear bright with very helpful staff. We arrived just as a talk was being given by a holocaust survivor and it was the start of an inspirational visit. There are lots of things to see, all well spaced out so no need to strain to view items/pictures.Well worth a look, we were there approx. 90 minutes but could have spent half a day comfortably.Nice part of town so no fear of any crime, hawkers or beggars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ladysasi
50,A small but important landmark,"If you have an hour or two, take the time to visit this beautiful, poignant museum. It does cover WWII and the atrocities, but also delves into other equally significant things, like15th-18th century antisemitism, and the role of American troops at the Nuremberg trials. Much of the physical content was donated by Holocaust survivors that moved to So. California after the war. It was personal and beautifully curated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/takeaboattakeatrain
50,Excellent,Fascinating yet serious historical records. Certainly worth a look and something to consider. Not really for kids but adults should take a look!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CazzaCazza
50,Well organized and interesting museum,"We visited in Feb 2017. I just realized I never reviewed it. This museum was very well organized. There was a wall of TV’s going all the time with recordings of survivors interviews and you can pick the one you want to listen to on your device. They also have survivors talks as well. We sat in on one while we were there. Lots of Holocaust related items and art work on display. There are monitors in the back, one for each of the concentration camps, where you can learn about each one. I found the museum thorough in covering the Holocaust and very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patricia21675

10,Tour guide was vile....,"I tried to leave a review 5 weeks ago when I had just been there, but Tripadvisor didn't ""like"" the words I chose to report what the tour said and did. So I am having to choose different words. I was just reporting what she said to students, but it thought that I was the person who was spewing hat**d. So she explained the exhibits, but added her anti-Tr**p ?Conse**ative views to the impressionable students. She was just vile. I spoke to the director (or whoever was in charge since the director was in a meeting), and she assured me that the guides are instructed over and over and over not to do such things. I will take her at her word, that this lady was a rogue, but I still want people to be aware. I am all for free speech, but this lady was speaking her ha*r*d very loudly, and to students. I didn't go to the museum to be insulted and lied about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonG420
50,A somber must-do that engages the soul.,"We visited the museum as part of exposing our child, newly teen, to the realities of the past. It is beautifully haunting to come a bit closer to the reality of war. My mother survived the bombing of London so I was keenly educated to the atrocities that were conducted during WWII. The museum does a fabulous job of subtly educating the guest about WWII and the deaths of millions of Jews, Gays, and others deemed not part of the German Reich.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reyc632
50,So moving! So poignant!,"LAMOTH has to be the most moving and touching museum I have ever been to. The displays are both poignant and chilling as they explain and bring to life the history of the holocaust through the voices and lives of real people. The displays are interactive. The audio guide is excellent. The museum offers guided tours and you can hear stories from holocaust survivors. I'd urge you to go, take your children if you have them - you will all learn something. Oh & take some tissues - it is incredibly moving.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/an-old-pup
40,Well-curated exhibition,"I have visited Dachau, the Holocaust Museum in DC, the Rwanda genocide museum, the Killing Fields and Tuol Sleng Prison in Cambodia, and now this museum and each is somber and well-executed. Sad always but the spirit of humanity rings loud and clear, both we at our worst in some and also our heroic best in others.A sober moment to rejig our priorities and compass in life is never a bad thing. Lest we forget.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FunkyWanderer
50,Excellent museum.,Plan to visit several times as there is a lot to see and subject matter of course is depressing. Very nicely curated.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dianebQ5995ZE
50,Visit with speaker - a survivor!,Excellent volunteer-led tour of the museum & overview.very interesting museum full of information on the horrors of the Holocaust.Audio tour is available.Then I attended a survivors story of the Holocaust - who went to auschwitz. Incredible experience!!WOULD ABSOLUTELY recommend to anyone to visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamessM3795FY
50,Such an interesting museum with excellent audio information and survivor testimonies,We needed a whole day to do this museum justice! We found the exhibits fascinating and the audio commentary added colour and interest to the exhibits. We attended a survivor's talk which was excellent and very moving. But we didn't have enough time to finish the museum and listen to the many recorded survivors' testimonies which we'd have liked to do. LA is very lucky that people can listen to live survivors' testimonies in this way. The opportunity to do so elsewhere is diminishing with the passing years.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ros57
50,Very moving experience,"The museum is integrated as part of a park. The audio tour is very helpful and the entry is free (please do donate though). The museum is small but very comprehensive. It touches on all aspects of the Holocaust - events leading up to it, the orchestrators, the genocide, international response, heroes and aftermath. Post the museum, do visit the memorial for children of the holocaust which is right outside. It is a beautiful and respectful monument for quiet introspection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NidhiC_12
50,Holocaust Memorial Day 2019,"We found this an excellent, educational, moving visit.We are in LA from the UK for just two weeks and particularly chose this special day. I have studied the Holocaust extensively yet found the 90 minute tour and overview by the dossent extremely clear and helpful.Especially helpful are the parts of the exhibition showing what led to this dreadful time - defeat, hyper inflation, the depression all leading to the rise of AH and the Nazis.I have visited Yad Vashem in Jerusalem many times, but that, of course, is on a much larger scale and rewards several days of visits. The LAMOTH is still very worthwhile, particularly for those who have little prior knowledge or who are unable to travel further afield.A very special part of our visit today was the talk by Paula Lebovics, a survivor of Auschwitz. It was a privilege to hear her speak on this particular day - the 74th anniversary of Auschwitz’ liberation. Seeing her tattooed number moved us to tears, as did her own very strong emotions as she recounted her experiences.This special place in LA is not to be missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fiosol
50,Great way to spend a couple of hours,Really enjoyed this museum. A little hard to find despite being near a large shopping area (The Grove). Excellent self guided tour available (although all the exhibitions didn’t work with system. Excellent presentation otherwise. Multiple small exhibits appeared to be the theme. Security is a little tight (as one might expect) but all the staff was friendly and helpful. Learned a lot and would definitely go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kvhak
50,Important Messages That Are Just As Relevant Today!,We were visiting the LA Farmers' Market and decided to walk over to spend an hour at The Museum based on a friend's suggestion. Beautiful architecture and powerful content. This museum was founded by survivors of the Holocaust so many of the artifacts come from survivor families. Only wish my kids had been with me! Will definitely be back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/misopiso88
50,"Very Enlightening, Timely","I was nervous to go to this museum as I like to keep vacations light, but I am so thankful my family convinced me to take a few hours out of our day to pay tribute to the lives lost in these horrible events. I have studied the holocaust in school, read books, and watched movies, but nothing made it quite so real as seeing the people's faces, reading their journals, and hearing about their experiences in their own words. With today's reduced tolerance, rising racism, and increasing prejudices surrounding immigration, the lessons offered here are beyond vital and timely.The museum is free to enter with a suggested donation of $10 per person. This is very reasonable as you could spend hours here. My family spent 2 and wished we had budgeted for more. Upon arrival, you are given a headset that plays wonderful, engaging recordings that correlate with numbers posted on different exhibits. Music buffs will appreciate the original songs incorporated throughout (look for the music note icon).While I think this museum has valuable lessons for all ages, small children (depending on attention span and maturity) may find the subject matter too distressing and the focus on audio not stimulating enough. The experience definitely leads to wonderful discussions, though.I have limited mobility and appreciated that seating is offered in each section so you can rest while viewing the displays and listening to the descriptions.A must see for anyone wishing to learn more about history and develop greater appreciation for those who have gone before. You'll leave with heightened empathy, greater compassion, immense gratitude, and a new lease on life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/frogandtoad1
50,"Sad, but must be remembered","It is a very sad place to visit, but it is a must see for everyone. It really hit me & made history very real to me when I saw their shoes & wedding rings that these people left behind. They also have the uniforms that were worn in the camps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whitaangel2018
50,Very Important for Everyone to See,"The museum is free, donation is encouraged. There is free parking near the museum. I really found interesting the LA Times articles on display that start in the later 1920's till the wars end. It gives a good sense of the indifference people had towards what was going on. Very sad. Many testimonials and stories of people that were affected by the holocaust. Plan to spend at least 2 hours. There aren't many places to sit and it is cold inside the museum so wear a sweater or jacket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeyDog
50,Inspiring take on a very difficult subject,"The Holocaust is always a difficult subject but one of the unique points of this museum is that it was founded by Survivors. The strength of the survivors comes through in so many of the exhibits. We greatly appreciated the opportunity to visit this important museum.We were especially lucky in that on the day of our visit, they had a guest speaker, a Survivor, Ms. Eva Nathanson. Her testimony was so vivid and so genuine. Born in 1941, the majority of her conscious memories as a child began with slowly realizing that your family was always at risk, later learning that your father has already lost his life when you were just barely a toddler. There was the concept of having to “play hide and seek” knowing that the hiding was actually not a game. She spoke about how certain situations could re-trigger the trauma that she still carries, like a recent visit to Europe with her daughter when she stayed in a hostel. The cramped space brought back nightmare-inducing memories of how she had to remain hidden as a child. Her stories are now impressed in me. Her strength is such an inspiration and we were so privileged to meet her and have her share her experience with us.Thank you to everyone who is associated with this wonderful museum. Such an important time for people to remember the atrocities that actually took place at a point in history that wasn’t all that long ago.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanieC
40,A very nice historical touch.,"Please don't miss to visit the museum once you visited in Los Angeles. This is the first time, I am visiting the a museum like this. A moving and audio trip experience and of each section would benefit to understand the time period and it give a better understanding of the artifacts displayed there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sssajin
50,This is a place you must visit in LA.,"I've been here several times, my first visit was a field trip with my high school history class. I've visited several times again since, and each time it's been a profoundly moving experience. It's completely acceptable to take school age children and is suitable for all persons beyond school age. I recommend that you visit this place several times a reminder of what could be should we choose to be complacent. Prepare for several security checks, bring tissues if you're a sensitive soul, wear comfortable shoes as there's lots of walking. Some parts of the museum can be chilly so I'd also recommend a light jacket. Come open to learn and change.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WhereTheWindBlows909
50,Great Museum,Very historical; the self-guided tour was great. Learned more information than what is ever presented in school. Free parking available in the nearby park,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkchock
50,DEFINITELY worth a vist!,"This was one of the major highlights during my recent visit to LA. It is filled with displays, exhibits, historical artifacts and personal histories of survivors and those who perished under the Nazis. They have an excellent audio tour which narrates the history of the many displays. I highly recommend this museum to adults and teens who are visiting LA. I don't think seeing the horrors and atrocities is appropriate for younger children. The staff were very professional and knowledgeable. Parking can be challenging so be sure to allow time to find parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobca1947

50,Excellent!,"Don’t miss this! Excellent staff and exhibition. Have audio tour if interested. My only issue was that the artifacts seemed more from survivors than from those at the camps. Free with donations accepted. Nice gift shop, mostly books but some jewelry and mezuzah cases made by a survivor. Parking a few blocks away in garage. Unfortunately someone fashioned a cross out of the notes you can put in the peg board in the children’s exhibit-very inappropriate. Worth the drive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HB-KB
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"A very moving experience.Humbling exhibits that will make you think about life and history.You won't forget what you see here.What can I say?It's a very moving experience.A horrible time in the world's history comes alive at this museum.Just seeing the faces on the wall is enough because you know what happened to them.However, history has to be told, and it is sure told here.George Vreeland Hill",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeVreelandHill
40,Much Information,"The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust displays many original artifacts and information. Having gone through the museum, I believe that a summary of each area or time period as you enter would benefit and give a better understanding of the artifacts displayed. The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust is definitely worth a visit if time permits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adventurer1234

40,Don't miss the lecture given by Holocaust Surviors,"I am not big on these types of museums--I skipped the Holocaust museum in Washington DC because I find the atrocities that occurred to disturbing--I sent my wife and two kids, though. I was glad we caught the 1 hour lecture from a Holocaust survivor as a child, before out tour. He related how he survived, and that only 1 out of 4 children survived. You draw a card before you enter which has the name of someone who was in the Holocaust, how old, where the family lived, at the end you find out what happened to your person.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/quasimoto559

You can begin with a viewing of testimonies that are featured on a wall of TV screens. You can spend hours here alone.

Kids are welcome and encouraged. Do visit the memorials outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarreJ
10,Worst experience!,"My family and I visited the museum with our school-aged children thinking this would be an educational experience. Was I wrong! 5 min into our arrival we encountered a survivor, Mary. She came up to us in a such confrontational demenur, yelling at us for bringing our children and “exposing” them to such things as the museum. I was in utter shock! The rest of the tour just stared at us, the tour guide did NOTHING to remove her or calm her. I asked her to leave us alone and that I was their mother and I obviously approved of the visit. She continued to yell and verbally attack us, made my son cry as he starts to have a panic attack, begging to leave. The staff tried to calm US instead of HER! I was as polite as can be and never disrespected anyone.I know that if the roles were reversed, we would not only have been escorted maybe even detained. The security guard roled his eyes when we asked him to intervene. I don’t think she is an appropriate person to conduct tours. This place advertises school field trips, she most certainly should never be allowed to be around children!! Shame on this place for allowed what they very much are educating on, abuse and segregation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/322va

50,Excellent Display,A Museum well designed and displayed. With the help of an Audio Guide it is very easy to walk through all interpretation. Worth a visit and you can be lucky and meet a survivor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PierreBMalta
50,A sad time in history.,What can I really say? It was a dark time in our history and sad thing is it still goes on today. The museum is kept very nice and clean and the staff are beyond helpful and nice. It's free to get in and they do have a donation box that you can choose to donate into. A place for reflection and to pay our respects. Free parking in the park lot.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rshaneel
30,Great historical information,"Drove by and stopped here on a whim. Loved that it was free and quick and easy to maneuver around. The old copies of the LA Times were great reads, the artifacts were equally wonderful and I learned a lot more than I knew before. Fascinating.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lletcher2016
50,Time to reflect and remember,Visited this centre on my most recent trip to LA. I have been to many other centers around the world including Yad Vashem and the DC museum. I was just as moved in this one as I have been in others. The fact that you can take your time and listen to as much or as little information as you wish is fantastic. I could have spent hours in the testimony room listening to these amazing people and their experiences. I highly recommend a visit here as it's so easy to forget the struggles others went through to give us some of the pleasures we enjoy today.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Di_Australia1302
50,Haunting,"We were very glad we visited this Museum recently and that we allowed plenty of time to do so so that we did not need to hurry. We used the excellent audio equipment which interacts with the various exhibits and there is loads of material to listen to, far more than you would need unless you had days and days. The museum is laid out in a series of rooms and you go at your own pace and follow your own areas of interest. We found the events leading up to the Holocaust to be well explained and they bring a salutary lesson to us in 2017 with still millions of refugees on the move and seeking sanctuary in safer places. The time seemed to pass very quickly and we resolved that later this year we will visit Auschwitz in Poland.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stotty24
40,"well worth seeing, but with a few caveats","The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust is well worth visiting, and it provides a decent amount of information about certain aspects of the Holocaust. Its emphasis, without question, is how the Holocaust targeted and affected Jews, and it does not provide nearly enough information about how other groups (such as homosexuals or artists, scholars, gypsies, or enemies of the state) were targeted or affected or treated. The free audio tour is essential if you are going to learn anything here, as the actual displays themselves provide VERY limited information. Many of the museum's artifacts are not explained at all, including on the audio guide. And quite a few of the numbered ""stops"" on the audio tour did not actually have corresponding audio explanations. This was intermittently problematic throughout the museum, and it is something that the curators/caretakers there ought to pay MUCH more attention to. On the plus side, this museum has some artifacts--particularly pertaining to the Dachau concentration camp--that I have not seen anywhere else or even heard about prior to my visit here. Combine a visit here with one to the much larger holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., and you'll learn a lot. One final note about the L.A. museum experience: It is frequented by groups of school kids (both middle school and high school on the day of our visit), and it is not laid out in a way that fosters those larger groups. The kids were semi-behaved but their sheer numbers and loudness and inattentiveness made it nearly impossible to visit some of the exhibits until the kids left those areas . . . mostly because of the ""tight"" way that the exhibit rooms are structured physically.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/187hughk
50,Remembrance of the lost lives,"First thing came to mind of LA is Hollywood, movie stars and Fashion. This little museum is a good change to remind oneself not to forget the past, and be aware of the future. Been to Yad Vashem and this is much smaller scale, yet a good break from the typical like The Grove.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/momopost
50,From the Heart,"Located in the Pan Pacific Park, right behind the Grove, you will find an outstanding new museum featuring artifacts, memorabilia, personal possessions, photos of prisoners, photos of top SS commanders, etc. There are videos, live speakers, movies, and technological items which the individual may study of their own preference. You may call the museum or search the Internet for their programs. If you are interested in the history of this tragic time in our world, you will find many answers to your queries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rhodad2016
30,A Time To Reflect,"I had the opportunity to visit this museum with my daughter yesterday and I'm glad I did. First, I appreciate the fact that it has its own private parking garage free of charge for those visiting the museum. You just pull up to the closed gate, press the button and someone answers through the intercom. You tell them you're visiting the museum and would like to park. The gate opens up and you drive in, where you park and then take the elevator up to the second floor.The museum has nine rooms chock-full of memorabilia, pictures and tons of information. You have the option of just wandering on your own, but a recorder with headphones are offered free of charge. The two employees at the front desk were very courteous, and while the elderly gentleman was helping some patrons, the younger man helped me and my daughter with the radios.I agree with another poster. The recorded information given for each picture, and each artifact can be extremely long, and I found myself just walking away and stopping the recording. There are more than 26 hours of recording, but I only listened to about 5 minutes.The museum is very small, but with enough information, pictures, letters, visas, etc. etc. to help you understand the magnitude of this diabolical agenda orchestrated by one man alone.It's also worth mentioning that there's no fee to visit the museum. That being said, they do have a donation box and I believe that putting a little something in the box helps.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nereida
50,Sobering visit,"This was our 2nd visit to LAMOTH, a free museum dedicated to remembrance of the victims of the holocaust.This small museum is well laid out with excellent exhibits – we particularly wanted to visit one of the current temporary exhibits, the Pankowsky Collection with the paintings of Sofia Guttentag-Davidson. The exhibit was wonderful – Sofia”s art tells a story of how the human spirit can endure even under the most difﬁcult of circumstances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denver60
50,Educational and well done.,This museum is excellent. You can take a tour with headphones and every section is described. Just key in the # and the explanation starts. Everyone needs to see a museum like this to remember what happened to 6 million plus Jews. It should never be forgotten. Some areas were tough to listen to and I cried more than once. Everyone needs to be aware so this never happens again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdngeese

50,An experience you won't forget,"This museum is a daunting humanizing reminder of a very dark and painful period in history. The presentations are educational, informative and heart wrenching. Parking access is good, and access is easy for mobility impaired individuals.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snobuz78
50,A Must See for Everyone,"We enjoyed our visit of the Museum of the Holocaust. It had a lot of displays and survivor's giving first hand accounts of their horrifying confinement in a concentration camp. Would not recommend for small children, probably for ages 11 and up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anne_66_10
50,Really interesting,At times they have holocaust survivors telling their story.Audio and group Tours of the museum.The museum is sort of underground which is very intriguing.

50,Sobering but interesting,I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this museum but I am glad that I sought this place out. I have always been interested in this aspect of history. Visitors receive a device with headphones that offer hundreds of recordings that highlights all areas of this part of history.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/flyboy1946

50,Event at the Museum,This was a lovely and inspiring place to hold an alumni event. Relatives of holocaust survivors and scholars spoke to our alumni group and provided heartfelt insight into one of the worst times in human history. The museum itself is deeply informative with photos and dialogue that capture pieces of the holocaust. The hors d'oeuvres and drinks was a nice addition to the event.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrangeKipepeo
50,Interesting and educational visit,"We found this museum by ""accident"" and so glad we did! Within walking distance of the Tar Pits so can park there and do both in 1 day. There is so much to listen to and learn about that you could be there hours. We stayed around 2 hours and only really saw a small part of what there was to see. You get an audio guide and can walk round at your own pace. There's lots imps interactive exhibits. I spent a lot of time at the section around the perpetrators where there was lots of information about who was involved (in addition to the obvious) and what they did and what happened to them. It's something you don't really learn about as much and I found it quite surreal looking at a picture of a ""normal"" man and listening to what they did. Recommend to all ages - well worth a visit!! The museum and the audio guide are free (which is unbelievable) but there is a donation box at the end.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimkkkkkkk
50,Worth the visit. Impactful.,"While my daughters felt that the one in DC was better, this was my first experience. You get the opportunity to listen as you're going thru the museum. It takes quite a long time if you want to do it that way, or you can do it without listening and just walk through and look at the exhibits. It is very impactful and very sad. The museum is free of charge but even if there was a fee it would still be worth going to. It definitely makes you think. We tend to take a lot of pictures when we go places, as I tend to scrapbook. After we walked out of the museum my daughter said to me ""mom, I didn't take any pictures. It just didn't feel right"". When you hear something like that you know how much your children were affected. The experience definitely moves you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/behavinit
50,A Must Visit - the World Should Not Forget,"Wonderful experience.The exhibit is free of charge. A convenient set of headphones & ipod-like device to use while there (also free) makes this a tremendous adventure.The photos are displayed quite appropriately, & the organization is superb.For anyone that has any interest @ all, this is a must.For those who have no interest, this is mandatory.One can spend as little or as much time as he can manage, but plan on @ least 90-120 min. to even begin to do it justice,I recommend taking the listening device, & using it at intervals - wherever you have more interest or questions. It's a great supplement to what is seen & what you can read, but its not a commentary on what you are actually seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nelsonz4

50,Great for groups small and large,We took our 8th grade class there. Got to hear from survivors and got guided tour also. Lots of information and lots of media types to interact with. Has headphone stick. Really well done and can be surface or deep as to information seeking. It does not charge for admission but we gave donation of about 10 each. Closes early on Friday.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ymalv
50,Lots of information/history. A few of the camp screen apps were buggy or broken.,"There is more information here than one can take in in anything less than a full day visit or even multi-days. The audio tour is great, although I would guess I was able to listen to less than 10% of the audio descriptions in a three hour visit. The story of the Holocaust and Jewish persecution is present nicely in a chronological manner, with many side stories available as well. The display cases could have used many more placards - many items were not labeled and not covered in the audio tour. Also, a few of the screens that had all the pertinent information on the major death camps were buggy or broken. There aren't a ton of artifacts associated with the camps themselves, but I don't know that I needed to see more than what they had. There is no admission fee, although a donation is suggested, and there is an underground secure parking area that I think no one knows about. Lastly, I understand that this is a museum dedicated to a very horrible part of our history, but I think they could offer a few more items for sale - a book version of the items displayed in the museum, for instance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/parksvisitor
50,Weekend trip,I have been wanting to see the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles and they are not open on the weekends. This museum is FREE and covered everything. Audio tour is available. They even has a room of videos of survivors which was interesting. I cried because it is very emotional. Very secure in fact it is underground parking and a armed security guard on duty. on top is a memorial.Free but you can give a donation which I did.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TinaB540
30,could have been better,"I have been to the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. twice and would go back again. This museum, although they had quite a bit of memorabilia, it was displayed, for the most part, with no English explanation, and although they gave one earphones and an ipad,it wasn't enough. Each room had SO many numbered exhibits, it was daunting. The ipad shuts off indiscriminately. Some of the numbers were unfindable - and some numbers never matched anything I could find. I thought it took too much time to find things to listen to, and sometimes they were way too long and one lost interest. It was ok, but I thought it could have been put together better, and it was somewhat difficult to find the entrance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GirlsGranny

I normally steer clear of audio guides but I'll admit this one was fantastic - where you can jump to any number at any time, they were terribly long but got information across efficiently.It's hard to take it all it in; we certainly left with a feeling of heaviness.The parking garage was easy to park in (had to buzz through to the front desk) and the staff were helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,You'd never know it was there,"This is a small, intimate space tucked away as if it were an underground bunker. You can't see it from the street, but you can if you're standing in the middle of the park (and if their garage is full, park in the park. If you want to do anything at the Farmer's Market or The Grove, park in their garage, but be prepared to pay).The collection is small, but quite remarkable. It is set up like a Timeline, so start in the room to the left of the front desk. They have survivor talks, and these people are extraordinary. Not many still live - talk to one while you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cjnkira

You understand the true reality of war, deprivation and victimization! Like the holocaust museum in Berlin, this museum too follows families, children lost, families parted, never to meet, and brings alive the horrors perpetuated by humans to other humans in the name of religion, race, domination! This museum affected me so much that I did not talk for almost 3 hours after I came out! There was so much to think about, so much that touched your heart!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZiaChaudhuri
50,A life-changing museum,"A museum that everyone should visit. You are given a headphone self-guided tour that narrates you through all of the sections: pre-war, life in Nazi Germany, the Holocaust, and post-war. I learned so much about the breadth and depth of Jewish life in pre-war Europe, which was one of my favorite sections. The other areas were difficult to go through, but so important. The exhibits that impacted me the most were the framed concentration uniforms, and the model of the Sobibor camp, narrated by a man forced to work there.

It grieved me to see the history of the violence against the men, women and children just because they were Jewish. I am touched that the 12 tribes of Israel and the Jewish Nation have thrived since. I think it wonderful that they educated themselves and their descendants to never allow this to happen again. I pray that the ignorance that so many have against Israel with stop.

40,A moving reminder of man's inhumanity to man.,"A quiet, respectful atmosphere permeates the building as people move quietly through reading, observing and listening to the history of the Jewish people, the events which lead to the atrocities and of the camps. The exhibits are mainly photographic although there are some small antiquities - books, personal belongings etc. This museum is very personal rather than merely being a history lesson, which makes it more poignant - there are photographs of survivors and details of their experiences, harrowing images of the dead and of the Nazis responsible.The museum is easily accessible for pushchairs or anyone with mobility difficulties. Only criticism? Not easy to find - the Americans don't seem to have the British equivalent of our brown 'Tourist Attraction' signs so before you go make sure you have detailed instructions or a sat nav.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/236caths

A display of dolls wearing clothes denoting Jewishness were especially interesting to me. I also enjoyed listening to the stories of survivors and stories about heroes who didn't survive.

50,Next best thing to visit Germany...,"Having lived in Los Angeles for years, this is my first time to visit this place. The atmosphere seems quiet and sad, with all the display of Nazi atrocities. At the end of my visit i have a heavy feeling and offered a prayer for peace. No more wars!Visit this place... You'll appreciate life more :-)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mandarin_mom
50,Give yourself TIME,"This museum is incredible! So much information - we went an hour before close, and we felt rushed. Would love to go back and give this museum the attention it deserves.Use the walking tour headset to get the most out of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/heathermK513VW
50,Small but impressive!,"Let me preface this by saying I teach history. However, both my husband and daughter found the interactive audio tour was very interesting! Plus, it is free. This poignant museum should be a must for any family with older children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lovestotravel_8
50,What a wonderful tribute to the Holocaust...,The grounds and buildings are beautiful. The museum is well layers out with many interactive stations. Well worth a visit.Try to go when a survivor is speaking....allow at least 2 hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnelson805

50,Fabulous Museum - Hidden Gem,We stumbled upon this museum by chance and spent a couple of hours completely engrossed in the exhibits. Parking is free under the museum and the admission is by free will donations and includes the audio guide which I highly recommend. The exhibits are well curated and don't miss the memorial garden before you leave. A must see for everyone from young adult on up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keckeley
50,Must see when in LA.,"Inspiring, amazing, troubling... a must see for people of all faiths, followings or... pretty well anyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gord222
50,Great find!,"This museum is free to the public, though they encourage donations to help local students visit and learn about the Holocaust. My boyfriend and I were able to walk in without reservations and were the only visitors there on a Thursday afternoon. Parking is available in a private garage. You press the intercom button, tell them you're visiting the museum and how many are in your vehicle, and they let you in the gate. The audio tour was great because you could choose exactly which topics you wished to hear about and set your own pace. Tons of photos, items to view, and testimonies to hear. It would likely take days to experience everything available to see/hear. I was told they have survivors come visit when schools/groups come in that you can join. Great experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/steggie07
50,"Excellent, Informative, Eye-opener","I decided to bring my children here (17 & 20) because I felt they needed it. The first thing to jump out at me is how hidden this place appears to be, and easy to miss! We arrived two hours before closing, which was not enough time, even though it is a small museum. There is just so much history here! I wanted to read everything, watch all the film clips, and look at the exhibits. My older daughter remarked how there is so much omitted from their schoolbooks. I also learned a lot, and it is such a shame that the lack of assistance by the US to the Jews and our history of anti-Semitism is not widely known in the US. Some of the photos are heartbreaking, especially the ones of children. I plan to return and watch more of the testimonies. No entrance fee, and I did make a donation. The iPods were great and loaded with information. Everyone should visit at least one Holocaust museum in their lifetime.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsKMB
50,Very informative and a good cultural experience.,"Its on the small size, but it's an eye opener for thos who do not know the history. Its better to catch a guided tour which runs frequently fro free then to listen to all of the ques through the head phones. Very touching stuff!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alanroytbak
50,Eye opening...,"It's not something for young children, I took my middle school aged child - its not something that you'll forget soon. The museum places you IN the holocaust, you see and hear and feel the people there. Very educational experience and worth a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CLBrown67
40,Somber Experience,"It's a Must See for All Humanity! It's free, donations are kindly accepted. They give you a headset with an ipod that has numbered/pre-recorded messages for each exhibit. You then walk freely thru the museum and listen to what you want to listen to. Pictures/articles of personal items are on display. A great visual layout of Sobibor, one of the Concentration camps, which I had just read a book about. Very well done, that we all need to experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DebbieR720
50,Grateful for the experience,"I was told about this museum by a co-worker, and being new to the LA area, I had to check it out. Upon arriving, I was pleasantly surprised to have free museum parking followed by a free entrance (make sure you leave a donation, there is a school program where you can choose to send several students up to a full classroom to the museum with your donation). Upon arriving you receive headphones and a iphone-like keypad. Each exhibit has a number you type in to hear the audio going along with the exhibit. Other reviews posted they were complicated but it really is as simple as typing in a number. Someone mentioned the headphones being isolating but think about it...you're in a holocaust museum, the experience is supposed to be isolated. And it is pretty easy to slip the headphones off to talk to your guests. My fiance and I went together and had a great time discussing the exhibits. The museum design itself was very unique, going into the museum from a landscaped field and descending down into dimly lit exhibits to display some of the psychological effects a concentration camp had. The main reason we went was to attend a lecture from a holocaust survivor. I believe they have a survivor speak every Saturday at 2. If you really want to experience the holocaust, there is no better way than to listen to someone who was there. If you are visiting the LA area, put this on your itinerary, you won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rfn88
30,Expected more,"Whenever I visit a Holocaust museum (and I've been to a number of them in the US), I never want to seem irreverent by offering a bad review. The information at these museums is vital. It proves the Holocaust was real and offers first-hand experience. This museum was free. Nice to have that offering in such an expensive city. But you must wear headphones to hear recordings and experience every part of the exhibits. It's an isolating experience. You feel alone as you listen to all these stories (anyone who came with you is also wearing headphones and you can't share the experience). The technology is also a little daunting. It's like an iPod…but it often took a long time to buffer and find the audio. At the end, there are so many screens that you don't know which one you're really watching because sometimes the audio doesn't sync up. Additionally, as you sit there before the Tree of Testimony, you never know what language something is going to be in. I went through FIVE before getting one in English. Some are in Polish, Yiddish and German. NONE of the non-English testimonies was subtitled. And, it seems such a disservice…some of those clips are TWO HOURS in length. How can you watch just a bit of one and then jump to another? I wish they'd cataloged those better so if you were hoping to hear about children in the Holocaust, you got to see four or five people talk on that topic. Or if you were looking for Poles who survived, you could see four or five specifically talking about their experience. Bottom line…this is good to visit and it's free. But it's not an easy experience. Go to be educated.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chgo919
50,"We should all visit this place, wherever we're from",Loads of well set out information with free audio. Probably too much to take in over one visit but you can choose what you want to listen to to have an overall view of the rise of Nazism to the end of the war or listen to much more detail.Incredibly moving and of course upsetting and unbelievable. Great service.Free but donation appreciated and I would say necessary to encourage this preservation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The2KsAuckland
50,Learn about the Holocaust,"This is a must see. See how the Nazi came into power. Learn how the Nazi hated different groups of people, Jews being the primary group. See how many countries turn away the Jews when they tried to flee German occupied countries. See live stories of survivors of the Holocaust. The museum is free and with guided audio tours. We were parked at the Farmers Market and walked the short distance to the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/678ralphg
50,Never Forget,"They have survivor speakers, tour guides, etc. Take your kids so they understand this moment in history! Also, must visit the outside children's area...must see this, they have 1.2 million holes in a wall representing the kids that perished. Someone made a heart which was nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sesshi101
40,Very good museum and FREE,"I liked that this museum was free, including free underground parking. It is also located close to the Grove and Farmer's Market, which is where we went afterward for lunch. The museum is guided by an audio tour. It would be difficult to explore the museum without the audio tour, as all of the info comes from the stories on the audio. There is less to read in each exhibit. I wish there were more seats/benches to sit on while you listen to each audio segment (there are a ton!). I recommend for a modern museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmmyMPLS
50,"Small, but intense","This is a special place. It seeks to educate people, including schoolchildren, about the Holocaust and its history, its happenings, and its importance. Not to be missed. Not. To. Be. Missed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/794deenaw
40,Worth a visit.,The Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust give a very intresting presentation of the history of the Holocaust and also other masmurder in the near history.The audio guide is a must.It is interesting to be informed of the very little difference between behavior in diferent countries during the beginning of the war. The negligation of the knolage by some political acting people.Worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Restaurang
50,LA Trip,Great exhibit to see the heritage of my family lineage. Would recommend anyone of the Jewish faith to visit the next time you are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/debs720
50,NIcely Done,"A must do if in LA. Free and well done.I would strongly recommend the headset......we passed because we thought we could easily walk through without it, but we couldn't have been more wrong. The headset would have added a lot to the experience and elaborated on many of the exhibits that were not in English.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CoachJTL
40,Moving.,"Not a well known a traction so certainly not crowded. It is smaller than other museums but well organized and very visual. Also free. I would recommend skipping the guided tour and doing the audio tour. We missed so much info by the guided tour and did not have time to redo the whole museum with the audio. Would appreciate some labels on things to help with the guided tour rather than just numbers meant for the audio tour. I realize that the guides are volunteers and try to do an effective job but people in our tour group had more info than the guide. Also did not appreciate her frequent guilt trips placed on visitors that were not Jewish. Frequently saying "" how could you stand by and let this happen"" when actually in the group there was no one that had even been alive at the time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ozarksun
50,Moving museum but not on the regular tourist maps unfortunately,"This is a well thought out and respectful display of a tragic episode in our history.We are a family of five with three teenagers and wanted to visit this museum. We only knew about it as we saw it on one free map given to us but boy was it really hard to find! Even our trusty sat nav kept sending us to the Museum of Tolerance! We kept asking people living in the vicinity and no one had heard of it or would direct us to Pico Avenue to the Museum of Tolerance. On the point of giving up and going to another museum we asked one gentleman who did direct us to here. I understand that the museum is new and only three years old but surely an important subject as this should be more widely advertised? Hence the review to help elevate its status on trip advisor .The museum is well planned and laid out in chronological order of dates and events generally. There were lots of moving visual displays and illuminated photos of real people and milestone events with informative audio which you could choose to listen to by selecting numbers on an iPod given to you. Some of the subject matter in particular was hard to listen to eg ?545 about Dr Mengele and his experiments on children and twins and the roll calls in the concentration camps.Initially I felt that each piece of audio was perhaps too long as I wanted to know find out more about many of the images, but I came to the conclusion that some subjects just cannot be rushed over and that this museum really needs more than just one visit of a couple of hours.A really excellent museum all in all, but it needs to be more obvious and better advertised.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JHSimpson
50,In the Heart of LA lies a hidden Museum,"On our trip to CA we decided to add a bit of history to the trip. My teenage daughter is very interested in the Holocaust and asked if we could visit this museum. We didn't realize how hidden the museum was.... we drove around the block several times before realizing the museum parking is underground with no signage advertising the museum at all. It was like they wanted to keep the museum a secret. We had to be let into the gate and were told to come directly to the front desk.The museum is free; however they do ask for a donation upon departure, which is well deserved for the quality of the displays and the information that was provided.Upon arrival we all had to submit our Drivers Licenses, which were returned to us upon departure. We were also given IPods with headphones which led each of us through the museum at our own pace, which was nice because with 3 kids all at different age levels, this gives everyone the opportunity to view the displays and hear the stories that they are most interested in.The displays were unbelievable for being such a small museum. We felt privledged to be able to view such items and hear such stories, albeit horrifying and saddening.So when in LA and you need a dose of reality stop by the museum and pay tribute. You won't be disappointed......at least we weren't.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raynor5fam
50,Lots of Information,"This place is different then The Museum of Tolerance. This is about the Holocaust, the people/families who were there and about family members who died. It is full of information and you can get headphones and an iPod touch so that you may listen to someone tell you about the articles and people they are showcasing. There is a wall in the museum that is lined with TV screens. You can type in a number associated with the screen and listen to the person's story who is on the screen at the time. We enjoyed this museum as we walked out learning more about the Holocaust and the history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KCJ44
30,Cannot compare to Washington D.C. Holocaust Museum,I was disappointed because I thought it would be similar to the museum in Washington D.C. but it was small and did not have the dramatic displays of items like the Washington D.C. museum. I did not like how everything was audio and the information was all given through the ipod. There are 31 hours of audio to listen to if you listened to every exhibit number. Too much information and not enough visual aids.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seibs
50,A must see thing to do,"We were on our last day of our holiday and were advised to visit the farmer market where we had a great lunch and wonder around the shops. We looked on trip advisor for any attractions near-by and found the museum was within walking distance, what a find! The museum is clear bright with very helpful staff. We arrived just as a talk was being given by a holocaust survivor and it was the start of an inspirational visit. There are lots of things to see, all well spaced out so no need to strain to view items/pictures.Well worth a look, we were there approx. 90 minutes but could have spent half a day comfortably.Nice part of town so no fear of any crime, hawkers or beggars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/robwelf0
50,Very Good,"We visited here during Spring Break with our son. It is near the Grove and Farmer's market so is quite convenient. The Museum is very good with lots of information in various rooms and different themes. It is a sad story but there are some who fought against the horror (Sugihara, Schlinder) so parts were uplifting. I know the story but my son who is 10 does not know it as well. Now, he will be able to dig up some of these facts in the future when he encounters them in school. Because of that, I believe that it was a very worthwhile visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/419KenL
50,A sad story thoughtfully presented,"We only found out about this museum from signs at the nearby Grove Shopping mall. Buit into the park opposite this is a very moving museum with the story very well told,for people of all ages. We were fortunate enough to be guided by a wonderful lady , herself a survivor. Excellent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
40,Moving exhibit; Very Informative,"I took my teenage niece and two of her friends to this museum on a recent trip to Los Angeles. My niece had heard about it from her history teacher and wanted to see it. The Museum entrance is opposite The Grove and the parking entrance is gated and leads to a small underground garage. We got there 10 minutes after they opened, and there was a sign that said the garage was full. After seeing someone else let into the garage, I decided to give it a try & pushed the intercom. I let the guard know that we wanted to visit and asked if paking was still available and he buzzed us in. There aren't many spaces, so I suggest going when they first open, or paying to park at The Grove.The museum (and parking) is free, but there is a donation box at the entrance if you are inclined to support the museum, and they also have a program that uses donations to sponsor inner-city kids on field trips to the museum. They offer free audio guides via an iTouch. You can use your own headphones or borrow theirs. They ask that you leave your ID with them when you borrow the guides to ensure they are returned.There are a total of 9 rooms in the museum, so we were expecing the visit to take no more than 2 hours, but we were there for 3.5 hours and could have stayed longer if we wanted to listen to all of the audio guide information. There are some items in the cases with descriptions, but you really need the audio guide to get much out of the museum. It is filled with photographs and there is also one ineractive display area regarding the different concentration camps.Outside, there is a wall dedicated to the children who lost their lives in the holocaust. It is filled with holes of different sizes to represent the ages of the children. Here you can write a note about whatever you wish and leave it in one of the holes.The grounds outside are like a park. Because the museum has no cafe, I'd suggest bringing food with you to picnic outside if the weather is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMM2001
50,Very Informative,"This is an excellent source of information on the holocaust. The audio tour is optional, but it is highly recommended. Their iTouch (for audio tour) has a simple interface and definitely carries more information that on the exhibits. They periodically have a member of the holocaust survivor to speak and tell their story.The short film on 'Why we fight' (I think that was the title) is also a must see.Total time required.. approx 4-5 hrs to hear and see everything. The staff and security are also helpful. There is no cafeteria or any food source inside..A must see for people with such interest.. and its free !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaumiT
50,Thought provoking,"This is a very well laid out museum. First of all you can park underground and it is free. There is no fee to enter and no fee for the self directed tour. I very much enjoyed the ability to walk thought the museum at your own pace. While I was there, a professor from UCLA spoke.The staff are very friendly and helpful, definitely worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JECan
