50,A wonderful house,"There are so many reasons to visit this fabulous house that is now close to 100 years old. Its construction, basically a primitive form of slab tilt is fascinating, its reflection of the character of early Hollywood is instructive especially when you review early photographs and recognise that it sat largely in open fields except for a few early houses like that opposite now demolished, it reflected too a radical approach to California living with its rooftop canvas covered summer accommodation. To visit this house and criticise it for being a series of empty rooms is to miss the point, it represents a wonderful part of the evolution of Californian modernism. Let us hope that money can be found to restore and re-open the roof spaces. It is 27 years since my first visit, it was simply wonderful to return and introduce my wife to this endearing property. The staff were generous with their time, willing to talk and to enthuse.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/855JohnP855
20,"Probably not worth your $, unless you're REALLY interested in the house","Very cool house, but I agree with several other Yelp reviewers that it's not a great house to tour. You pay $10 for a self-guided tour of the house (they give you a short pamphlet with information about the house). The house is very small, not in great shape, and not furnished. Worse - it was filled with an exhibit that blocked what little of the house you can see. It may be an interesting house, but it's not a great tour, and I don't think it's worth the $10 admission. Too bad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
10,"Total waste of money. Fortunately, it doesn't take too long","Old run-down house in a very nice neighborhood. Easy to park at. Self-guiding tour with minmal restrictions.That's the good news!Let me list some of the negatives:The people who work there are useless and rude.The house is pretty much empty with no furniture or information to read.The house is run-down and in need of repair.$10!! for what? To walk into a few empty rooms and leave unsatisfied?Hard to find, too (wish I hadn't!)Don't waste your money!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunsetPelican
20,Disappointing - clearly not interested in having visitors!,"I often have out of town visitors and like to show off the special places in Los Angeles - we arrived at the Schindler House and were lucky to find close by street parking - there were three staff members in the office, the one at the front dest was speaking on the phone, the two other staff ignored us - in between his phone conversation we were asked for $10 per person - the website states it is $7 - eventually one of the other staff came to help - we asked about seeing the other properties and were told that in order to do so for our $7 we would have had to book on line as the other properties are not staffed - no explanation of what we would see other than pamphlets on the exhibit (a list of the work and artist(s)) and floor plan - As others have said the property is in need of significant upkeep and probably funding - but if staff are not welcoming and/or informative visitors will not be inclined to return and or provide funding. The building was interesting but would be more so if it was furnished in the original style - Too bad this could have been a real treat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moferry
30,Best suited for those in the design/architecture profession!,"We visited the Schindler House as part of a group of architecture enthusiasts touring some of LA's significant architectural sites. This is indeed a significant site. But I don't think this house will be of much interest to those who are not in the design/architecture world. While the house is quite impressive as an early example of modernism (and the grounds are very nice), the lack of a guided or audio tour is a huge gap that would leave the casual tourist cold. The house is in poor condition in places. Apparently, events are regularly hosted here and the kitchen was still strewn with catering equipment they day we visited. The art installations were odd, and presented without much to contextualize them. If there had been a guided or audio tour, I would probably review this site differently.Admission is just $10 and included admission to two other sites run by the foundation. The bookstore is very casual but is probably the most comprehensive source for Schindler-related publications.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jameskul
50,Schindler House Visit,"We're architecture tourists, and modernism is our thing. The Schindler House is an early example (c1922) of international modernist architecture in LA, located in a suburban street in West Hollywood, you feel like you've stumbled into a secret garden. We enjoyed visiting this modest dwelling, the simplicity of the design and the setting make this a delight to visit. This is a must for fans of modernist architectural history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C1553OMchriso
40,Superb architecture,"Went there not too sure what to expect and was thoroughly impressed. Schindler's residence is almost more traditional Japanese than Modernist American architecture, but its setting on the plot, and its seamless integration of indoor and outdoor is definitely innovative and contemporary.The building itself is a little falling apart, and I'm not sure what to make of the exhibits the MAK put together in it, but I would still recommend taking a look at this amazing masterpiece of residential architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/991nicolasc
50,"A unique stop, even if not architectural buff","My partner and I (in our 40s) dropped in at the Schindler House and it is such a unique - and easy stop - that it really adds a bit of extra flavour and dimension to an L.A. trip.I'm the one with architectural training, but you don't need it to appreciate the uniqueness of this house (even today yet!), as my partner can attest. She thought it was so cool.It was something like only $7 per adult to get in and get a free tour (about 45 minutes). The docent was excellent and it really added to the appreciation.If in the Hollywood area it is highly recommended for a quick visit. And it can be: parking is easy, it's just off the beaten track (e.g. 5 minutes drive from the Farmer's Market), and it's not overly large, relatively (but big in ideas and experience).Truly takes you to another place and truly worth your time to learn and see :)ENJOY!GlobalTime",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlobalTime
40,Good for students of architecture or others in the profession,This house in really interesting in so many ways. In historical context it's an early international style modern home built with many utopian and socialistic ideals and has an interesting family history. On a practical level it's an uninhabitable concept house that is interesting in its own right but something I found pretty awful for its design. There's a lot to learn all around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unterwegsbrooklyn
30,Small but interesting modernist example,"Tucked amongst the bungalows and small apartment buildings of West Hollywood is Schindler House, reportedly the first modern house in California. If you manage your expectations, you will enjoy the experience of visiting this quiet escape in LA. It is a small property and rooms are very sparsely furnished. It would appear that the foundation does not have extensive funds to keep it up, as evidenced by water damage in several places...the modest $7 admission fee notwithstanding. Still, it is a wonderful example of early modernism and the play between interior and exterior spaces. Guests can take a self-guided tour of the several rooms and go up a small staircase to obtain a view of the garden. An interesting visit and retreat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrishG87
20,Worthy center but lack of clarity on website and rude staff undermine mission.,"Be careful of their home tours. You pay a pretty stiff fee for a home tour that on the website says begins at 11am and will take about 3.5 hours. You then get your tickets in the mail on the Friday afternoon before the tour that says you can't start your tour until 2pm which is too late for you because you work evenings. You scour the website to make sure you didn't miss something but there's nothing that says your tour may start three hours later than the posted starting time. You then try to call the Center to ask them if you can start earlier and there's no answer. You are forced to miss the tour because you can't begin that late. You call Monday to offer feedback that they should make the timing clearer on the website and end up talking to an extremely rude and arrogant young man... When we had to skip the tour we decided to not push for a refund and instead consider the ticket cost a donation to the Center because we appreciate the work they do. However, the attitude of the man who answered the phone ensured that this will the last donation we ever make to Mak.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MissSlimskys
50,A must visit for any student of architecture or architectural history,"The Schindler house is widely considered to be the first modern house. The flow of space and unique uses of spatial arrangement, finish materials, lighting and intersecting lines are incredibly fascinating. The house is 90 years old and looks like it could have been built yesterday, instead of in the height of the Colonial Revival and Bungalow era. The house and grounds are very clean and well maintained, but the house is mostly unfurnished as it is used as an exhibit space by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture. The lack of furnishings is rather disappointing as it makes it more difficult to envision the space in use by the Schindler family, but this is understandable. The employees at the ticket office/book shop are knowledgable and friendly, and are willing to offer advice on their fabulous book selection. Parking is free and on the street and admission is a bargain at $7 for an adult.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M0ther_of_5
50,This place is amazing!,"Simply put, this is one of the most revolutionary houses ever built. The spareness and simplicity of the building is amazing: it's often described as half-tent, half-house. Schindler rethought what it means to live, and to live in relationships with others, and designed a building that proposes an entirely new way to exist, both independently and interdependently. There are no velvet ropes and tedious tour guides here: you move through the spaces of the house and its room-like patios and gardens on your own, which allows you to imagine what living in this incredible place might be like. Friendly staff at the ticket office know tons about the building and will gladly answer questions. Visiting the Schindler House was by far the most astonishing place I've visited in Los Angeles. It's so subtle, so humble, and full of lessons for sustainable building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/unavailable11
30,Is that all there is?,"We were very excited to visit Schindler House after seeing the website. We're a big fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and modern architecture and what a cool thing to see, one of the most modern, historic homes in the city. At $7 per person, we were expecting a lot. Well . . .there's not much to see. You enter into the maze of the house. The kitchen was loaded with ""stuff"" (bags, glasses) like someone messy lived there. The bathrooms appeared to be, umm, working. Then, the rest of the house was just empty and filled with cobwebs with an art installation sprinkled throughout. We explored the garden a bit, but it was kind of strange and eerie. I guess I was expecting either a furnished house or a completely pristine empty house. This seemed dirty and abandoned. I would not have bothered paying $14 if I had know what there was to see. There are plenty of other houses in the city and Pasadena that are worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kiki178131
