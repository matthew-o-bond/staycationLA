50,Free Art!,It opens around 11am so email and get free tickets on their site. The parking is free and the neighborhood is Beverly Hills and beautiful. The artwork starts outside and their exhibits are wonderful! You can literally engross yourself in different periods and pieces from artists all around the globe. The Obsidian was the most mezmerizing and immense. I also (as a fan of Elizabeth Taylor) enjoyed the second floor tribute to the late legend with private photos from her home which included her Krupp diamond (33.19-carats!) and her Oscar's. The art ranges from the obscure to the erotic. I loved it and it is an amazing museum to see without some of the hustle and bustle of the larger museums in Los Angeles. GO!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/womansolo
50,Wonderful museum that makes LA a real Mecca for Modern Art,"With the Marciano Art Foundation's museum on Wilshire Boulevard, it boldly complements the modern art at the nearby Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and The Broad in Downtown LA. These four museums present a wide variety of modern art with very familiar artists and the still up and coming stars of the future. The museum is set in the former Scottish Rite Temple, which is a magnificent and majestic building constructed in the 1960s. The auditorium space has been converted into a large exhibit space which currently houses an interesting and provocative multi-sense art work that consists of sight, sound, and human interaction conceived by Donna Huanca called Obsidian Ladder. Another real highlight of the museum is the work by Yayoi Kasuma which features oversized flower-potted tulips made from fiberglass-reinforced plastic; they are painted with the same red polka dots as the floor, ceiling, and walls, creating an immersive viewing experience while at the same time diminishing the appearance of depth. There is also a very interesting ""Relic Room,"" which features artifacts which were part of the original Masonic Temple and give an insight into the history of the Masons. The museum has many other works of modern art that are uplifting and thought-provoking. They offer tours of the museum which give further insight into the works in the museum. Free parking is offered adjacent to the museum. And there is a wonderful view of the City of LA from the upper floor which has a nice open air terrace. A great museum experience. New works are rotated in every 6 months so the next visit will also be a new experience. You will need to make reservations online; price is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Most interesting Art Museum,"Housed in the former Scottish Rite Temple, this private collection is well worth a visit. Interesting to see what they did with the building too and there is a room with a collection about the Masons. Parking and entrance are free but advanced reservations required. There is a gift shop and a cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGKCalifornia
40,Free,"I came on a time when they were de-installing an exhibit. So my visit here was cut short. I spent about 1 hour or so. If there was a special exhibit I'd probably be here for 1 1/2 hours.Tickets and parking are free. You must make reservations to visit the museum. I started on the very top and worked my way down to the museum. The topest floor is where you will spend your most time (if there's no special exhibit) as there are lot things to see and plenty of photo ops. The next floor down is such a small space you'll walk in and out of it within 5 minutes.The second and first floor is where the special exhibit is. On the second floor there were also paintings on the wall that look 3D, really cool to look at. For a quick second you will think you are actually seeing the real object. (i.e., mailbox, palm tree, telephone booth, trash, heating lamp, and more).On the first floor there are a few sculptures, a cafe, and bookstore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee
50,Better than the Broad - and free,"I was not expecting anything much, having not seen anything about this place. The publicity profile locally has not been high - and what a waste. The building itself is fascinating with a really bizarre history. The collection was interesting, entertaining and varied. Currently refurbing level 2 for new installation - their installation space is vast and reminds me of the Tate Modern in London. As always, there is a vast collection only some of which is shown. I was surprised by how many permanent installations there were compared to exhibit pieces. Free parking on site as long as you have a free reservation - and how often can you say that in LA?This is a definite highlight in the LA Contemporary Art scene and they have made it so easy to see - something other places should note.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler2504
40,A very pleasurable visit,"From web booking of ticket to reception on site a very smooth management of dedicated staff. The founders of the clothing brand Guess behind the latest addition of the city's art museum.In the meeting room of the old men's club, the brothers Marciano presents the private collection of contemporary art from 1990,sThe result is colorful and surreal. An entertaining visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,"Beautiful, just beautiful",Went out of our way to see this (relatively) new museum. and were thrilled by the contents. I highly recommend it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/asharp77
30,Very Average Museum in my Opinion,They were changing a main exhibit so ground floor was closed and that was a drag to be in transition on a main exhibit when we had reservations but nevertheless the museum was quite boring in my opinion. The tulip room on 3rd floor was interesting for a minute and nice pictures can be taken in a white and red polka dot room. Some of the art was interesting and colorful. All I can say is thank god it was free or I would of been dissapointed. You only need 1-2 hours as most. I did not like the hat room and I did like to look at Elizabeth Taylor's home photos which some were interesting. I would not go back myself. Free parking near and location is I think in Hancock park area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/965rickn
50,Fantastic Art Space,"A unique and beautiful art space, and (at the moment) not as crowded and overrun with selfie-takers as the Broad. It is absolutely worth a visit - and it very close to LACMA, so you can get your full art fix all at once!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImekaSF
50,A New Marvel in L.A.,"I discovered, along with my friends, an excellent art museum on Mid-Wilshire in Los Angeles. It currently has an exhibit of Ai Wei Wei, the Chinese artist. It is a place well worth visiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ilbert2015
50,"Huge rooms, rare art","Showed a rare exhibit of Wei Wei of a huge platform of sunflower seeds and spouts of ancient tea pot, and fantasy animals floating in the air made of paper and wood. Free. Lots of fun",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eyemlucky
50,The Marcianos generous gift to LA,Tickets & parking are free so there's no reason to miss this gem. Not over-whelming. Provocative. Fun. Beautiful. Youthful. Relevant. Go!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fearless703533
40,Museum in Former Scottish Rite Masonic Temple,"The Marciano Art Foundation is in the former Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, on Wilshire Blvd., in Los Angeles. Admission and parking are free, reservations are required. A cafe near the entrance offers a variety of food and beverages. The patio to the west of the building features sculptures. My husband and I enjoyed our revisit (first time was when it was a temple and open for non-Masonic events) and viewing art exhibits in the spacious gallery rooms. What a wonderful museum find!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tapbelle
40,Rainy Saturday,A little busy for a rainy Saturday. But you cannot beat a free trip to a museum. Really nice artwork inside. Some artwork I don’t understand why it’s called art. There’s a glass jar full of jellybeans and it’s posted up as “art”.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAretha
50,Fantastic building with great exhibitions!,"This is a great new addition to the Los Angeles art scene and it is fantastic, love the renovated repurpose building and the art in it.Is a must to make a reservation to visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mundosully
50,Definitely 5 Star,Why would anyone give this place less than 5 stars? It is one of the hottest tickets in town. It is all free (entrance and parking) but you have to order tickets in advance. They only give out so many a day so that it is never too crowded inside. There is a wide range of art to see and the building is a gem in itself. Make sure to visit the library on the mezzanine level to learn the history of the building and see the before and after photos.ai weiwei is fascinating and thought provoking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/panama2000
50,Plan ahead!,"This contemporary art museum is free, but you must have reservations and for weekend visits you’ll want to make them a month ahead. Great space in what once was the Masonic Temple, built in 1962. Great large spaces to feature large installations. Lots of employees to help with information and monitor for safety. I was told there were over 50 employees working on the Saturday I was there. They are not volunteers. These are paid staff. Free parking behind the museum. Supposedly you are allowed to park for two hours. And this is exactly the amount of time we wanted inside. While there, we saw both temporary exhibitions and permanent collections. If you like contemporary art or are open to it, I highly recommend a visit to this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
40,Wei make u broaden ur horizons?,Wei Wei outstanding! Rest very fine! Feminine and Columbine projects too special! Whaat can a male say?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredNLuvinIt_11
50,Great Free Exhibit,"This museum was established by the brothers Paul and Maurice. It is the same family that founded the Guess clothing brand. Make reservations on the website for free entrance and parking. There is also a 2 hour free street parking. Upon entrance head to the 3rd floor right away for the exhibit of Yayoi Kusama , With All My Love For The Tulips, I Pray Forever 2011. Yes, this is the same artist of the famous Infinity Mirrors at the other museum down the road. Besides this the Ai Weiwei: Life Cycle was equally facinating. It shows the technique of kite making with bamboo. No selfie sticks are allowed here so better visit with someone to take photos.There are other arts to be viewed and I was informed by one of the staff that some of the art is rotated every six months. A small cafe and gift shop is located next to entrance. Free strong Wifi a plus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Maria2628
50,Wonderful exhibit and space.,Great museum addition to city. In former Masonic building which is an artwork in itself. The Aw Wei Wei exhibit is not to be missed. It is incredible. Take everyone including kids. Hurry because even though it is free u need to reserve online. Weekends are booked for next 6 weeks. Also nice exhibit of museum works on top floor. Heat bargain in city ( along with Broad Museum). Nice to see some billionaires are not greedy and are giving back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
40,"Great space, free parking and admission, wide range of exhibits.","Inspired conversion of a Masonic temple into a contemporary art space. The displays change, so your response may vary. The current exhibit of Ai Weiwei is excellent. Some of the past have been very good also. This would not be my first museum to visit in LA for a first time visitor but its a good space and worth seeing if you have time, and have seen other spaces first.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BEIreland
50,Loved this museum!!,"Free admission, free parking and fantastic exhibits!! If you can, get there before March 3rd 2019 to see Ai Weiwei's Life Cycle which is extraordinary!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dijou
50,Art Right Next Door!,"Who would have thought that right in my very neighborhood of Koreatown is an art museum that houses the most exquisite of modern art. The Marciano brothers (of Guess fame) have restored the former Scottish Rite Masonic building into three floors of masterpieces. On my most recent visit, I saw the Yayoi Kusama collection, featuring her unique and vivid polka dot collection. After just seeing a documentary on her journey and extraordinary life, this exhibit was “infinity” and indeed larger than life. Of particular sentimental interest to me was a photographic display of Elisabeth Taylor’s home and personal art and jewelry collection. The gift shop is also quite an experience, filled with eclectic finds. Parking is conveniently located behind the building. Please note that tickets are complimentary, yet must be ordered online in advance of visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bonniedeb13
30,LA Has Better Art Choices,"The museum is a gift to Los Angeles from the brothers who created the GUESS? line of clothes. And, when I say gift, I mean it. They bought the art, they bought the building, and they are allowing us in for FREE. Plus, they are letting us park for free. So, the choice of art and how it is displayed is theirs (not mine) to choose. You must reserve the free tickets well in advance to go.The building, a former Masonic Temple, is cool but the inside is definitely not worth a visit in itself. The art is interesting in the way that cutting edge contemporary art can be. If that is your cup of tea, by all means go. It's not mine. Having said that, the contemporary art the the Broad is more accessible in my view.Also, when I visited, there was really only one floor of art -- the top floor. So, my visit was relatively short, perhaps an hour and a half.I am glad I went but do not recommend it to visitors to LA who have many, in my view, better choices for contemporary art including the Broad, LACMA, and the Hammer.Final note: If you go, don't miss the second floor room with its interesting Masonic artifacts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelDreamin
50,Go!,The only drawback of this great art museum is that you have to buy tickets online in advance. Good parking behind the museum. The collection is thought-provoking. The Yayoi Kusama exhibit (red dot room) was fantastic (and Instagram-worthy). This used to be a Masonic lodge and there is a small room devoted to artifacts left there by the Masons. Highly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/911Traveler007
40,art as meditation or meditation with art,"My husband and I chose to make our first visit to this new museum for the Olafur Eilasson installation. It was fascinating. This is NOT grab-and-go art; you really need to go in, stay, and give yourself time to absorb the experience. I found myself drawn into a state that went from fascination with/attempt to figure out ""how"", to awareness of others' reactions to the work, to observation of my own mental processes regarding all of this, and more. My husband, not one to sign on for meditative excursions, was by my side for the hour we stayed in the Reality Projector show.Afterward, we wandered through the other levels. There is much to see and contemplate here, but it is all very contemporary and challenging to anyone who prefers figurative art.I was happy to find the docent in the Masonic archive area knowledgeable and respectful about the materials that had been left when the Scottish Rite sold the building. For anyone who has ties to, or and interest in, that part of the story, please make inquiries.I look forward to introducing others to this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sfvalleymom
30,How to relate to art you don't like?,"A friend from out of town visited and got tickets on line, free of charge!Went on Saturday morning, easy parking on the lot. The old Shriner's Auditorium.I like the building and the space was large, wide open and easy to navigate. Very friendly ""docents"" throughout. Yet the art itself, contemporary, was very difficult to relate to. It had the extremely fun 'signage', those explanations written by PhD's in art literature describing dialectic dualisms of the art and artist. I enjoyed them more than the art itself.Worth seeing, for an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drtike
30,OK,I went here to see a light and sound installation. Nice place and worth the visit if you are nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mattiase2013
40,Outstanding New Museum,"I chanced in here simply because I saw a street banner for Olafur Eliasson’s Reality Projector show and figured it might be interesting. What a wonderful museum! It’s free, and parking is free (unlike so many other “free” LA museums). It’s a relatively new museum in a historic old Scottish Rite Temple, and despite the very hip contemporary art and reworking of much of the space, the curators have decided also to honor the building’s history by maintaining its exterior and certain features of the interior, including some beautiful late 50s/early 60s mosaic work by Millard Sheets. In addition, there’s a nice little archive of Masonic ritual apparatus on the mezzanine.The Eliasson show was interesting, but not the most interesting part... On the second floor was a gallery devoted to two German artists of different generations who have paired their art. It was well beyond my experience, interest, or taste and I didn’t love it, but I’ve seen something I didn’t know about before... and it was free!Then on the 3rd floor are the ballroom galleries, which display works from the Marciano Bros. permanent collections. This is a really wonderful assemblage of (generally) multiple works by a good mix of contemporary artists. A lot of the painting work seems to concentrate on texture of the canvas and paint (or sand!) in ways I’m not used to (the works by Guidi, Weiser, Auerbach none of whom is seen before to my knowledge), and leave you wondering how the painting was made and how it will hold up over time. Some of it is less exciting to me, having more of a “design” than an “art” feel (totally didn’t get most of the Stingel, who is kind of a centerpiece), but I’m also no expert. But there are a number of simply breathtaking works (like Alex Hubbard’s Lens Painting), and there are also a number of really funny works (Jose Dávila’s Untitled 2015 homage to Donald Judd; also his Esfuerzo Commún), as well as one really creepy one which I’ll let YOU find—so it’s quite a nice mix.The space feels clean and fresh, the works are well placed and well lighted, the attendants are informed and happy to talk about them, and I can see myself going back again sometime when I’m in LA. I’d certainly recommend it to anyone who’s not yet been.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IAmTondelayo
40,"If you like modern art, this is a very good choice for an hour's visit",We took our grandkids at another relative's suggestion --- very manageable museum in the old Scottish Rite Auditorium. We didn't just love the temporary exhibit though we know many who have loved it. The permanent exhibit was more to our taste and also the mural on the second floor was quite interesting. Huge and helpful staff -- and no entrance fee -- contribute to this being an enjoyable experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trup
50,Excellent companion to the Broad,"Amazing art gallery in a former Mason Lodge. Easy accessibility, well-lit galleries, and substantial modern art. The Olafur Eliasson Reality Projector is amazing. Expect to spend at least 15 min in it. They should charge for an experience like this. If you liked visiting the Broad Museum a mile down the way in DTLA, then Go!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobPhibbs
50,worth a diversion,"you will see other reviews that hated this place. understand that this is a private collection, so it reflects the taste of the Marcianos and it also reflects the range of contemporary art.the setting is the former Scottish Rite building, a landmark on Wilshire Blvd. What the Marcianos did to preserve and adapt it is totally commendable. parking is in the back, and you need to pay attention to parking issues in this neighborhood. the space for art is excellently conceived. staff are friendly and helpful (except.....don't mess with the guards for the parking lot...strict....you can't walk through the driveway).inside, they have a cafe, store, and you are welcomed to a well-lit space. do visit the small room with the history of the temple. In terms of art spaces in the US, this museum now has one of the larger volumes for art, the former auditorium space. Now with Jim Shaw, who challenges the viewer. Upstairs, there is a large area for the key parts of the Marciano collection.One must compare this museum to the Broad. In a sense, they are complementary, but the Marcianos seem to have made choices that are somewhat more cutting-edge and interesting, at least based on what is on display. Of course, you need to see both.for planning, you might spend a quick hour in this museum, or you might spend half a day, depending on your taste.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk
20,Not my art style,"This place is an amazing facility, but unfortunately the choice of art is not what I like. The price ( free) is right as is the parking and the place limits the number of visitors. But my choice for contemporary art is the Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterKenn
10,CONtemporary Art Fiasco,"The Marciano is a CONtemporary (emphasis on CON) art fiasco that makes you lose faith in humanity. Except for a few pieces, everything else is CONtroversial, at best.The highlight is the security personnel: A gaggle of rent-a-cops with passionate orders to harass you for whatever reason. I was ""energetically"" reprimanded for getting too close to a WATER FOUNTAIN, and my wife was ""approached"" for setting her purse on the floor between her legs when trying to take a picture. After these two ""incidents,"" an amped-up security guard with a buzz-cut followed us everywhere until my wife told him, almost in tears, that he was freaking her out. The supervisor found us and apologized but these things are NOT supposed to happen at an art exhibit.In conclusion: This place has an angsty vibe that makes viewing art a torturous affair.Fortunately, the entrance is free. My advice: spend $15 and visit LACMA´s Ahmanson Building where you can stare at an enormous Motherwell (or an inspiring Rothko or a mesmerizing Pollock), as close as you want, without anybody harassing you, to your heart´s delight. The ladies working at LACMA are sweet and kind and there to help.Art is supposed to celebrate humanity, and the Marciano fails miserably at that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Philip0121
50,GO. GO NOW. RUN!!,"If appreciate contemporary art: run, don't walk! Marciano brothers put L.A. back on the map. On par with anything I've seen in 1979 Berlin or the old mid-80s Contemporary Temporary when first opened in L.A. The collection's stupendous, let's just get that out of the way. A great primer on what is currently out there sparing us the goofy installations etc of the MOCA (""negative space"", oooh). What really rocks you down to your boots is their incorporating Masonic Temple relics. Jim Shaw's wig room alone is stuff of nightmares (in a good way haha). But Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch's ""Ledge"" (videos, great audio, crazy furniture to take it in, 360 immersive experience under a...tent) --made me fall in love with art all over again. Fan of Takashi Murakami? You'll be giddy. And they throw in Paul McCarthy & Louise Lawler in same room; your hair will be on fire. Bravo! Free parking BUT got to get tickets online on their webpage. DO. IT. Tix are free but this is worst kept secret in L.A. so they go fast. I went online 1st of month when they release all month's dates --no problem, scooped up my preferred date/time. What a freaking treasure this is!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVinWA
50,Former Scottish Rite Masonic Temple,"This museum has only been open a few months. The building itself is worth a visit. Since the entrance is through the parking lot, definitely walk around the buidling and look at the facade facing Wilshire and the mural on Windsor. The museum is free of charge but reservations are necessary and is opened Thursday-Sunday. There is two hour street parking or park in the lot, free for two hours. Nice contemporary art and also installation art. Three levels. They also have a cafe and book store. Non-flash photography is allowed. Don't miss the Relic Room of Masonic Objects including an original stained glass wall . Located on the mezzanine level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millie4t
40,VERY helpful staff,"I want to start by saying the staff is GREAT. Available for questions about the art and other things, they are friendly, welcoming and really sharp. Never would have really understood ""The Wig Museum without the help of a nearby woman staffer. Wish I could remember her name.The building is great; they did a great job on the rehab. The art is very contemporary and sometimes really out there. It would help if they had more explanations for the pieces.All in all, a nice three hours there on a hot summer day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanR27
50,Contemporary art,The structure itself is an old Masonic building housing the marciano art foundation and is exhibiting contemporary art works. Beautiful pieces and very spaces. I enjoyed the historical information they had on the building. Installations are also housed and very entertaining. Keep an open mind when visiting . The parking is complimentary for two hours. Tickets are also free but by reservation only. There is a cafe inside and outdoor seating to eat by the cafe.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alemk001
30,New contemporary art museum,"The newest contemporary art museum houses the art of the Guess brand Marciano brothers. Located in a former Masonic Temple with three floors for public viewing of art work.Not a great fan of contemporary art, but did find interesting the exhibits including an upside down lighted Hollywood sign. As you enter the museum, you see two pieces of framed art on the wall covered for the most part by tarps. You think, the pieces not ready for public viewing, but in reality those are the art pieces kinda like the Magritte's ""C'est ne pas une pipe."" Similarly, there is a polished copper box the size of a large Fed Ex packing box with Fed Ex labels on it. That too is a piece of art. On the mezzanine level is a mural that goes around the four sides of the mezzanine with art that looks like driving through Los Angeles on Santa Monica Boulevard near Beverly Hills. The building itself is a piece of art with detailed mosaic works. There is also an exhibit of items left in the building by the Masons that used the facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cran
