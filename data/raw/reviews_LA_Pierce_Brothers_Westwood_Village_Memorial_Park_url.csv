50,Quite place to pay respects,"Great little spot to pay see Hugh and Marilyn resting place, no crowd and no cost parking. A lot of other well known names as well. Whilst it initially seemed morbid to go or like you'd be judged it wasn't like that at all. And she has been a big part of so many peoples lives even after death.",Nate B
50,I HAD TO see where Marilyn Monroe was laid to rest.,Lots of celebrities are here at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park. Very serene and pretty.

50,Peaceful,"I thought my spouse was nuts when they suggested we visit a cemetery. However this place was actually pretty cool. Since there are so many celebrities buried here I expected a ""circus"" vibe. However it was actually very serene.

50,Love this place,"We were passing so took the opportunity to visit again as it had made such an impression when we visited 3 years ago.A peaceful escape from the madness of LA ths small shaded cemetry is small enough to explore in an hour..Unfortunatly since our last visit Hugh Heffner has now taken up residence next to the lovely Marilyn Monroe securing his memory/place in history with $$$s. Poor Marilyn would not have approved, he paid her just $50 for the nude photoshoot when she needed the money. Years later he then used those pics of the now famous Marilyn on the front cover of Playboy's 1st edition without paying MM any royalties. (Not a fan, he used women)If ypu get the chance visit, its tricky to find but well worth it! The entrance is nartow, between tall buildings and you think you are entering a car park but just before the carpark entrance you turn shatp right into the cemetery quadrangle where you can discretly park up.",fordwater

Frank Zappa and Roy Orbison are also in buried here in unmarked graves.Before you arrive, it is best to download a map online identifying each celebrities location - as it may take hours to find your favourite star if you don't know where to look. The office does not provide a map, nor is there one available for purchase. Adittionally, staff are not forthcoming with information regarding the location of individual plaques.The memorial park is peaceful, situated behind the city in Westwood. It is a place lesser known by tourists and a location to remember some of Hollywood's icons away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood Blvd.Note: It is important to behave respectfully; photography is permitted on the grounds.",Makayla
50,Some of Hollywood's biggest stars are here,We stumbled on this cemetery more than 30 years ago while living in SoCal and were amazed at the number of stars buried in this extremely small footprint of a cemetery. Definitely find the time to visit but do a little research before going as you be amazed by the concentration of major Hollywood glitterati. A relatively unknown fact is that Frank Zappa is buried here in an unmarked grave as is Roy Orbison.,mdwstmatt

We wanted to pay our respects and visit the final rating places of Marilyn Monroe, Roy Orbison, Natalie Woods and others. This is a small, quiet place in a urban setting. Some of the gravestones are on the grass field, so I would recommend googling an image of where to find what you are looking before walking around them. We were looking for Roy Orbison for a while before we realized that he does not have a stone there. Otherwise it was easy to navigate.Visiting here, seeing the final resting places of Marilyn Monroe and others just makes the experience so real. I cannot really explain it.",travellinggal10

50,Best cemetery if you can only visit one,"This one is the best to visit since there are so many famous people here and little walking required to see them all. My advice regarding peoples' comments about the caretakers not liking tourists being there: They know tourists will come. Just be respectful and know that they aren't going to take you around or answer questions about where people are buried. Just Google a map and print it out to carry with you. If a funeral is taking place when you arrive, they will restrict where you walk. The cemetery is tucked away from the street. If I recall, it is located by driving onto a driveway next to a brownish building.If you want to see some great videos on the Hollywood area cemeteries, you need to go to YouTube and search for Hollywood Graveyard. These are so informative and are very professionally done! I think I binged watched them when I stumbled upon them.",Kelly J

50,Paying respects to some of the biggest celebrities who lived,"Finding Pierce Brothers (a.k.a. Westwood Memorial Park) can be tricky, but once you get inside this very small cemetery surrounded by the office buildings of the westside, you get a sense of peace. The major ""attraction"" would be Marilyn Monroe and her newly-interred neighbor, Hugh Hefner, however take time and read all of the stones and plaques in the side vaults - you will see familiar names. A cemetery isn't always the most exciting or romantic tourist destination, and this one doesn't overlook the hills and the ocean, but take time and let the importance of some of those departed sink in.",jglsongs
50,Gone But Not Forgotten,"A compact, well kept final resting place for some of our most famous citizens. This spot is tucked away off a main boulevard and takes a little sleuthing to find but is well worth the effort. Because the caretakers obviously maintain the property to such a high standard, guests and tourists were equally respectful. An appropriate level of dignity is maintained by everyone.Besides, the biggest names like Hugh Hefner & Marilyn Monroe (interred side by side), I was pleased to pay my respects to Dean Martin, Merv Griffin, Rodney Dangerfield and Don Knotts (one of the more visual bronze markers in the park).It's a small venue and perhaps will take no more than an hour of your time but I think it is well worth your attention.",pookala
50,Must visit,"This is a beautiful space and seeing the final resting place of so many stars is really educational. Often understated, you sometimes have to hunt for the headstones.

50,Beautiful resting place.,"I went here after my sister found it on google. It is not easy to find, as it is tucked away behind buildings, but once i found it, it is a beautiful place. A lot of celebrities are interred here, including, Hugh Hefner, Marilyn Monroe, Florence Henderson, and many more. A good idea would be to download a map of who is buried here before you go, as it is quite big, and you will spend hours looking for celebrities, if you dont. I did go into the office to see if they had a map, but they did'nt, but a lovely girl, told me where a couple of them were, close by.",Vicky K

50,You will remember this place!,"When I have guests visiting LA, this is the one place I attempt to visit because the reactions I get are so positive, that I have no doubt it's very special, indeed. OK...it's a cemetery, but it is so small, so well hidden and very interesting thus not your typical Memorial Park. Everyone rushes to see Marilyn Monroe's crypt which is white marble stained reddish orange from all the lipstick kisses it gets. Joe DiMaggio arranged for her to be at this specific spot to be near women who cared for her as a child. Reading the headstones of famous celebrities is fascinating! Singers Roy Orbison, Peggy Lee and Dean Martin; Actors Fanny Brice, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau Natalie Wood, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Farrah Fawcett; Writers Truman Capote and Will Durant; Directors/Producers Walter Grauman, Merv Griffin, John Cassavetes, Billy Wilder; Comedian Rodney Dangerfield, and of course Marilyn Monroe are some of the celebrities to find. Some graves are unmarked. You can look at Find A Grave on the website for help. I attended UCLA and never saw this place on Glendon Ave just blocks from the campus. I circled around the block 2 times before I saw the tiny sign to enter behind a large building on Wilshire. You can park inside and quietly walk the park area. I promise you that it's not morbid. Some stones will even make you smile. Find Rodney Dangerfield...I promise you'll laugh out loud!",Hildmat

But this cemetery is special as the last resting place of a number of entertainers I have watched with pleasure over the years or, as in the case of Billy Wilder, whose genius as a writer/director I have admired. Think of, in no particular order, Natalie Wood, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Karl Malden, Rodney Dangerfield, Eva Gabor and, above all, Marilyn Monroe. Also Ray Bradbury and Truman Capote. The cemetery is relatively small, but it is peaceful and feeds my sense of nostalgia. I wouldn’t have missed this for anything.",operalover939

50,Awesome Visit!,I finally got to see this place. It really was incredible. There was only a few people there visiting. Amazing at how many stars are buried or entombed here. I read all the reviews on here and they were pretty accurate. The staff was busy keeping the grounds manicured and they are nice people. We drove between the 2 buildings off Santa Monica Blvd and had no issues getting in off Glendon Ave the sign says 1218 as the address. I spent about 2 1/2 hrs here.,Scoot1966
50,Don't pass this up !,Such a must to see. Some of the most memorable Hollywood stars are buried here. Marilyn Monroe and the most recent right beside of her is Hugh Hefner.

50,The Easiest Place to Find a Lot of Celebrity Graves in L.A.,"I'm in Los Angeles for a few days and definitely up for a trip to one of the city's many famous celebrity burial grounds, but which one? A quick check on the internet reveals no less than sixteen possible choices ranging from the massive Forest Lawn and Rose Hill to a couple of small Jewish cemeteries containing only a few celebs. With the help of the web I was able to narrow it down to just one - Westwood Village Cemetery. Tiny in size at just over two acres, it contains a who's who of 20th century actors, comedians, writers, composers and others who have all played a significant part in our 20th century existence. Unlike visiting the graves of famous people in say Pere La Chaisse in Paris, the people interred at Westwood Village Cemetery are ones you can put a face to and have direct memories of. Whether it was the otherworldly feeling I got on reading the works of Ray Bradbury or laughing out loud at the self-deprecating comedy of Rodney Dangerfield or being blown away by sheer acting talent of a Burt Lancaster, these are my people and yours. They deserve not to be forgotten.Officially established by the city of Los Angeles as Sunset Cemetery in 1905, apparently there were burials on site going back to the 1880's. In 1952 the first of ten mausoleums was built where remains were placed in above ground slots. While most of the graves are traditional in ground burials, there are a few very famous exceptions. If you are looking for grand funereal art such as you would see in many European and eastern North American cemeteries, then Westwood Village Cemetery is not your place. Despite being the last resting place of many of the wealthiest people in show business, there is nothing Tinseltown about this place. It's simple to the point of almost blandness in appearance and lack of ostentation. Also, unlike many cemeteries that house famous remains, Westwood Village Cemetery does not trade on the reputation of its deceased residents. You will find no maps to borrow and no signs indicating where anybody is buried. You can find a map you can download on the internet, which I did and it was invaluable in helping find the graves.Finding the cemetery itself is another matter. Although it's just off Wilshire Boulevard it has only one entrance off Glendon Ave. and you can't see it from anywhere outside the cemetery. So enter 1218 Glendon on your GPS and keep you eyes peeled for this small size. It's the only way you know where to turn in - I missed it the first two times.I've posted pictures of many of the most famous burials so won't add more commentary, but here are 10 you don't want to miss.1. Marilyn Monroe - The most famous resident of Westwood Village has just been joined by the man who helped make her famous, Hugh Hefner was recently interred right beside her and doesn't yet have a plaque. You can recognize it from all the kisses.2. Natalie Wood - There is still a mystery of how she drowned.3. Dean Martin4. Roy Orbison - His marker is actually just a hat.5. Rodney Dangerfield - There goes the neighbourhood.6. Truman Capote & Joanne Carson - Why is Johnny Carson's exwife interred with Truman Capote?7. Walther Matthau & Jack Lemmon - The original Odd Couple are buried close together.8. Eva Gabor & Eddie Albert - Oliver Wendell Douglas and Lisa from Green Acres.9. Farrah Fawcett - One of America's modern sweethearts.10. Carl Wilson - The Endless Summer was over when this Beach Boy died of cancer at age 51.There are at least two dozen others I could name, but these should be enough to entice anyone to visit.",maritimeexplorer
50,Memorial for Old Hollywwod,"I've always wanted to see Marilyn Monroe's resting spot. I had no idea how may famous old Hollywood stars are buried here. It's a small cemetery tucked in heart of Westwood behind some buildings.There is a parking garage for you to park. There was a charge when we left though, not to much because we weren't there longer than an hour. Very beautiful grounds, Marilyn's crypt is easy to find. Hugh Hefner had passed a few weeks before we visited, but his crypt was still unmarked next to Marilyn. Lot's of other stars are there. Don Knotts, Natalie Woods, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemon, Sage Stallone, Jackie Collins, Truman Capote, Dean Martin, Farrah Fawcett to name a few.

50,Some big stars all within short walk.,Always wanted to visit Marilyn Monroe's resting place. For some reason I thought she was in Forest Lawn but she is in Westwood. This place is located right in the middle of the city buildings. You turn in off either Glendon or Wilshire and you think you are going into a parking garage. The whole grounds aren't more than the size of a football/soccer field. You can see 8-10 big stars within a short walking distance. As of Oct. 2017 you will see Hugh Hefner's resting place right next to Marilyn.,20anad15

I find cemeteries fascinating and have visited them in Boston and Key West, but this one is so different. Very intimate and small, but lots of famous people are buried here. Yes, you can go into the office and get a map and list/directions, but take the time to wander. Located directly inbetween office buildings, you would never even know that a cemetery was located here. Just a few celebrities buried here include, Florence Henderson, Marilyn Monroe, Don Knotts, and Mel Torme. Interesting and unusal stop, but worth it.",jbrenz
40,A bit weird but then again I am !!!,"So I do weird, not talking full-on weird but visiting a graveyard is getting there I suppose! Taking time out to visit here was a big ask especially as we are only in LA for 3 days and haven't even began to scratch the surface. The draw card though was Marilyn Monroe! She died before I was born and I only know her from films, but if you would like a quiet place to at least look for proper, and I mean PROPER stars, jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau etc this is it. There is the obvious sadness of death but there is also some humour in the headstones and that despite the riches and fame from being in film and tv we'll all end up in a similar place at the end. There was a few other families visiting their loved ones were and the stars are fairly easy to find, it's not a big place!!!! Recommended",Adam B
50,"Unusual Stop, but Well Worth It","Most of us don't think about visiting cemeteries on vacation, but you can do so easily here and pay respects to Marilyn Monroe, Stan Kenton, Peggy Lee, Frank Zappa, Roy Orbison, Truman Capote and so many more well known and fondly remembered celebrities. The grounds are not expansive which makes visits easy to accomplish in an hour or so. Unusual but satisfying stop.",California Dreamer
40,"Small, intimate cemetery to may stars!","You have to know where this is to find it. It is off Wilshire Blvd. in Westwood. We could walk from our hotel-Kimpton Palomor. We went early Saturday morning and were the only ones there for while. Joe DiMaggio chose this small, quiet cemetery for Marilyn Monroe's burial because of it's size the and lack of notoriety. Since then many famous people are buried here. Marilyn is the most famous, but Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemon, Rodney Dangerfield,, George C. Scott and Farrah Fawcett among others. There is a online map to help you find people, but not all that user friendly. We spent about an hour walking around and seeing many graves of those we know only from movies and TV. Certainly for an older crowd who would know all these people. It was a very interesting experience. Many very famous people with very humble headstones. Not what you would find at Forest Lawn, and I liked that. Go visit if you are in the area.",NCtraveldiva

It is a small cemetery so you can find everyone very easily in less than an hour. Beautiful place and well maintained. The entrance Canberra tricky.

We initially thought he was stopping at a shop or a restroom as he pulled off an incredibly busy street and drove up an alleyway amongst the office blocks.Slightly surreal to find yourself in a little oasis of green, suddenly quiet and serene.Some incredibly famous starts of yesteryear can be found here in graves, crypts, gardens and prayer rooms. It would appear that stars of a certain age and era find this the place to be once they have passed. The list of ""famous"" people here is quite staggering.

50,Truly unique,"Went on the dearly departed tour and they brought us here. They gave us facts as to why Marilyn Monroe's marble tombstone has turned pinkish and who owns the the empty spot next to her.

It is so interesting to think about who some of these people are and their life stories.We also saw the memorials of other celebrities including Natalie Wood, Rodney Dangerfield and Farrah Fawcett. We were pleasantly surprised that we had missed Marilyn Monroe's 90th birthday by just a few days, but her area was still covered with flowers, handwritten cards and photos.",elaine p

Scott to name a few. The only strange thing is to get inside this place because you go through a bank parking lot off of Wilshire Blvd and can easily be missed. The entire area is only about 2 and a half acres so you can park and walk around without having to keep moving your vehicle as other larger cemeteries. It's open daily from 8am - 6pm and if you find grave sites interesting you will definitely not want to miss out visiting place.",MichaelLong1963

Marilyn, Farrah, Dean Martin, Natalie Wood, Truman Capote, Rodney Dangerfield and so many more. Plan on spending some time here, so you can try to see everyone's gravemarker.",chilipeppers01

It is also very small so it makes a quick trip with out wondering for hours searching.",Ponderosa72

If you are in the middle of Westwood or Century City, or heading to Santa Monica, and need a place to go to gather your thoughts and feel peaceful, this place (believe it or not) is a good place to go. My theory about this is....there are a lot of successful people laid to rest here, and I believe they are at peace and feel content about their lives. So this cemetery is very peaceful. A lot of people go there to see the celebrity graves, but no matter, everyone is very respectful. It's still a very peaceful place for me and others..... a lot of history there......",Secondavenue

50,"Hard to locate, but worth the search!","You feel as though you are on a treasure hunt looking for this cemetery, but once you locate it, it is well worth the search! It is hidden away in the city, a small quiet, peaceful and unique cemetery. You won't need your vehicle inside the cemetery because it is small, and once you walk through the gates of the cemetery be prepared to be taken back in time. There are 100's of people buried here, well known and unknown, from all walks of life and quite a few military personnel here as well. If you are coming only to see the final resting place of Marilyn Monroe, you will miss out on so much more.Take the time to walk through the entire cemetery and you will be amazed at not only the headstones of the famous, but beautiful headstones from long ago. When you look, be sure to look under the bushes and at the base of the trees and you will see the headstone that are being overtaken by nature.When you see some of these headstones from long ago, I believe that these may have originally stood upright in the cemetery, but are now laid down to make it easier to manicure the lawn. You will even find what appear to be Spanish American or possibly even Civil War soldiers headstones.Since this cemetery is hidden from view, it's not a hectic visit, you can take your time and enjoy the serenity here. It evokes the feeling of old Hollywood, and if you are a movie or history buff, this is definitely the place you will want to come and visit. They do not have a map of the final resting places of those buried there, so be sure to go on line and print a copy of the map, as it will give you an idea of who is buried there. You can also go to the Find A Grave website and enter Westwood Village Cemetery and you can see everyone who is buried here.I chose some of the best of my photos to share with you, as I am sure you really do no want to view all 150 of them. So make sure the batteries of your camera are fully charged, as you will be taking lots of pictures!You will need some comfortable walking shoes, and be extra careful as the grassy area is a little uneven, so watch your step. Rather then trying to find parking on the street, you can park across the street for $5 for the entire day. Be sure to call ahead, if there is a funeral, the cemetery will be closed to visitors.And if you still have a little energy left over, you can visit the Los Angeles National Cemetery, which is only a few short blocks away.",charlottesl

50,Pay respect to the legendary Hayedeh,"We visited this lovely small graveyard in Westwood to pay respect to the most popular Iranian singer of all times, Hayedeh and her younger sister, Mahasti, also a very popular singer. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially when we couldn't find Mahasti's grave one of the staff walked us throuhh the sections to hers. He was very friendly and told us a bit about the cemetery and its past. He also showed us graves of other famous people.We then got the chance to visit MM while there, which was clearly the most popular with lots of flowers and visitors.Finding a parking was a headache. We ended up parking in a flatrate parking which wasn't ideal for our short stay.",HodaJ

We were so surprised to find it tucked away behind several skyscrapers in the middle of a busy community. It was difficult to find but so interesting to see. Some of our favorite stars are buried here like Dean Martin, Don Knotts and Ava Gabor. It's not a big fancy place like you would expect for a star's final resting place. It brings them down to a personal level with the average joe. There are ultra fancy monuments and those that are plain and approachable. We're all human after all.",Mark-Helen C

A google search revealed it was a well know film director. No doubt behind the black clothes, dark glasses and body guards there were a few celebrities in attendance.

I have been a fan of greats like Don Knotts, Roy Orbison, and Jack Lemon. But especially, I have been a fan of Marilyn Monroe since I was little. It is an honor for me to come pay my respects while visiting Los Angeles to a star that has resonated with me for years. I was heart broken after reading her story and seeing how misunderstood she was. Her entire life she just wanted to belong and be loved. If only she knew how loved she truly was and is still today. I am part of the Marilyn Remembered Fan Club and was thankful to see that there were still flowers for her on my visit this year. I was sad last year to see there were not any and left my flower bracelet around the metal vase on her grave stone.

I was fortunate that there was almost no one else there at the time that we visited and I was able to take as much time as I wanted. In addition to Marilyn there are many, many celebrities interred here and there was an extremely nice, calm feeling about the place that was conducive to a really pleasant visit. Open to the public for no fee, just check the opening and closing hours. Slightly hidden down a short lane so be sure to have the address handy to help you find it. It's a little surreal to see persons e.g. Dean Martin who's names and reputations are so huge being revealed as 'normal' in their final resting place.I'd call this a must if you are a Hollywood and/or famous person fan.Forever Marilyn",Karen G

50,An awesome experience!,"This place may not be for everyone, but it was certainly a memorable experience for us (six senior citizens). Growing up in the “Photoplay” era, it was an awesome experience to actually be at the gravesites of so many famous people who have entertained us over the years. Being an old-timer, I remember well the day Marilyn Monroe died; and I remember seeing pictures of her funeral. Seeing her actual burial spot has always been on my bucket list. Obviously, it is also of interest to many others, her marker or headstone or whatever you call it (her burial place is in a wall) has been discolored a pinkish beige from hands and lips touching the stone over the years. There are many, many other graves of famous people: Dean Martin, Natalie Wood, Farrah Fawcett, Burt Lancaster…the list goes on and on. Pierce Brother is a lovely cemetery to explore. We have visited Forest Lawn Glendale on a previous California trip. While Forest Lawn is a beautiful place, it is 300 acres and overwhelming to visit. We spent half a day and barely scratched the surface….and we were exhausted! Pierce Brothers Westwood is only 2 acres, so it is very easy to walk around and find the gravesites of persons you may be interested in. As other people have noted, this is an actual cemetery, so you do need to be mindful of being respectful. We did not experience any inappropriate behaviors; the few other people in the cemetery that day were acted respectfully. As others have noted, it is very difficult to find. I had explicit directions, and we still had a hard time finding it. It is completely surrounded by tall buildings. There is a very small sign, but again, it is very small. There are several parking lots nearby, and we got assistance from an attendant. There are a couple of websites with “maps” or directions to graves of some of the big names; we found that to be very helpful.",bcbcbc

40,Very interesting place,"This cemetery sits just off of Wilshire Blvd. and not many people are aware of its location. It is a small and beautiful site, but the reason to visit are to see the famous celebrities that have chosen this site as their final resting place.Reading the names and their final words can be hilarious especially in the case of Merv Griffon and Rodney Dangerfield.You can also view the resting place of Marilyn Monroe and many other greats from the past.",helene h
50,Soft grass and Silence.,"This is a beautiful little cemetery on the south side of Wilshire Blvd, behind a first run cinema complex topped with bill boards and yards of restaurants in Westwood village itself and lining the south side of Westwood Blvd. This area serves UCLA and Ronald medical center,so there are lots of exciting ethnic restaurants,with not a dud in the bunch. The cemetery itself is full of glorious mature trees, and soft beautifully manicured lawns in a tiny space. It has a lovely atmosphere and does not feel like a cemetery but a sleeping area,a camping area if you will, for quite a few very famous people all beautifully illustrated by T/A member photos. Of course Marilyn Monroe is a favorite and I was glad to see that flowers are still being left there. I wondered why the marble is an entirely different color from the other resting places. Anyway it is lovely and miraculously quiet,so close to a major Los angeles blvd. Armand Hammer who built the museum across the boulevard is also there. I'm sure he approves. Do visit. It's not maudlin at all.",mark +alexi k

Do your homework first. Google the site that has a map of the cemetery, as well as directions on where to find all the famous burial spots. Including the unmarked grave of Roy Orbison.

And, yes, it does seem odd to critique a cemetery as an attraction. But, hey, it's LA. This is one of my favorite places to take out of town guests. It's behind a series of tall office and residential buildings, between Wilshire and the neighborhood just to the south. It's small. So, you can circle through in your car, within 5 minutes, and just take a peak at Marilyn Monroe's resting place. Or, you can spend time and find the resting place of many more celebrities and LA's greatest business and social leaders. it's always serene and, though it does seem to get more and more visitors, it remains serene and a respectful place.

50,After (or before) seeing the Chinese Theater come here!,"After (or before) visiting the courtyard of the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Blvd., where the hand and footprints of myriad movie stars can be seen, if you are a motion picture fan you should come here, a tiny dignified oasis of a cemetery tucked away behind tall buildings, in which more movie and recording stars than you can imagine are buried and the great thing is that while in life you might not have been able to get near any of them, here you can get within six feet (or less in the case of those buried in the mausoleums). I was particular delighted to see two of my favorite comedians, Jack Lemmon and Carroll O'Connor (""Archie Bunker"") buried side-by-side. Walter Matthau, who co-starred with Lemmon in ""The Odd Couple"" and other films, is here too. Billy Wilder, the director of ""Some Like It Hot,"" is here also, along with the aforementioned Lemmon and also the movie's big star, Marilyn Monroe, whose crypt is not hard to find (it's an off pink color and covered with lipstick prints and flowers). Others buried here include Jim Backus (the voice of Mr. Magoo) who played James Dean's father in ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" Natalie Wood Wagner (who played Dean's girlfriend in ""Rebel Without a Cause""), Donna Reed, Burt Lancaster, singer Dean Martin, Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys, Karl Malden, Rodney Daingerfield, Don Knotts, and many more. Two words of advice. First: The cemetery is hard to find because there are only two small alleyways that lead into it, one from Wilshire Blvd. and the other from Glendon Avenue, which is between an office building and a parking garage. Don't make the mistake of parking in the parking garage! They charge $2.40 per 15 minutes and you can park in the cemetery for free. Second: Although George C. Scott and Roy Orbison are supposed to be buried here, you won't find any markers for them. When asked, the cemetery office explained they were each buried in ""an undisclosed location.""",Granddad Green Go

40,Lovely cemetery,"First off, if you’re getting public transport here then beware of how long this will take. I was staying on the Hollywood Boulevard and thought that this would be a short trip in the morning. I left at 8:30am and didn’t get back until 12:30pm! The bus to Westwood takes 50 minutes and drops you off nowhere near the Memorial Park. I didn’t have a map and the locals pretty much have no idea where you’re referring to; even saying ‘Marilyn Monroe’s grave’ doesn’t spark a reaction. There is a large graveyard here, too. If anybody mentions a ‘large’ graveyard then it’s not the place you’re looking for. It was around 8 blocks to the park which is pretty secluded. Once you’re inside it’s lovely to look at and around. Don’t listen to posts on the internet that say the office will provide a map of notable graves: they won’t. The internet in my hostel hadn’t been working so I wasn’t able to write down the locations of the graves I wanted to see. The park is small, but there are a lot of people buried here, especially if you have no idea where they are, plus there are lots of unmarked graves. Marilyn Monroe’s is easy to find, however. She’s around the side, not in the center grass lawn. Her stone is covered with kisses and is apparently the only person to receive flowers every day. I was unfortunate to visit on a morning (Friday) when the grass was being cut, resulting in the names of the markers being covered. I spoke to a member of staff who said I could move the grass and took me to where Natalie Wood was buried. I was also pleased to see Betty Page, who also had flowers. It’s a gorgeous little memorial park and made for a nice morning. If you’re driving then you can park inside. Be prepared with your map beforehand and allow enough time if you’re using the transport system.",Kim H

The entrance to the cemetery is on the side of an alley looking area...you'd never know that was the entrance...the actual entrance to Pierce Brothers. One minute you are in the bustling city and the next you are in the marvelous serenity of this magical place. Marilyn Monroe is in one of the wall areas not in the ground.

I was surprised to find Farrah Fawcett next to Rodney Dangerfied. I had no map with me but i had time. It was definately worth the visit to Marilyn Monroe resting place and to see my favourite author Sidney Sheldon also has a resting place here. It was pleasant sitting just sitting here contemplating things. There was a few crypts that were closed off. The staff at Pierce Brothers were great and gave me directions on where to park. Plenty of seating areas tp pay your respects. You can download a map of the cemetery and where the stars are located. They may be gone but never forgotten.,Vina446
50,One of the best Cemeteries I've ever visited.,"I will admit that this cemetery is pretty hard to find because it's so small. We were standing right in front of it and didn't realize it. Luckily an employee was walking down the sidewalk and he told us that we were at the right place. It's so small in fact that you can look at every single grave in less than an hour. Everywhere you look, there's a famous person buried there and no need for a map. Marylin Monroe is easy to find because she's in the wall but her grave is the cleanest. It's usually the only one with flowers and you can spot it from a distance. When you first enter, you see Truman Copote, Heather O'Rourke and Ava Gardner next to each other on the wall. Along the grass you see Carl Wilson, Minnie Ripperton, Natalie Wood, Donna Reed, Bert Lancaster and Bob Crane close together. Frank Zappa and Roy Orbison are there too but the graves are unmarked. A few feet over ( in the same row ) you see George C. Scott, Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Rodney Dangerfield and Farrah Fawcett. I was really surprised that this many famous people are all together in one cemetery. Hollywood Forever and Forest Lawn are almost impossible to find one famous person, here they are everywhere you turn. I highly recommend this cemetery of you can only visit one.",Gina K

Surprise to see the grumpy old man stars, I guess seeing them both in there together seem appropriately funny. Did not know Sly Stallone's son passed away. Saw Marilyn Monroe's resting place with nice fresh bouquet of flowers from her fans complete with a note. The place was very clean, and well maintained. It was a little chilly when we went there, so summertime will be the best time to come. For parking we used the metered parking, 2 dollars worth of quarters. It's one of the must see places of LA for me because of the stars of the Hollywood . They have made me laugh or cry with their shows, so I kind of owe them, somehow....",penelope j
40,Great place if you like celebrities,"It's really tough to find. I can't even give advice on how to get there. But if you can find it, you'll see Marilyn Monroe's grave, Truman Capote, Donna Reed, Bob Crane, Fanny Brice, Jack Lemmon, etc. It's a small place and there won't be many people around. You're surrounded by big office towers, but it's strangely tranquil. Well worth the trip.",SusanX
50,Little tucked-away gem,"I have been here so many times and it's a little gem in the Los Angeles area, not too far from Westwood. From the street, Wilshire, you'd never believe there's a cemetery and you have to be careful to turn properly into the driveway so as not to miss it. Graves of some very famous people here - Truman Capote, Donna Reed, Natalie Wood, naturally Marilyn Monroe - beautiful little cemetery.",portergirlbooks

40,A little oasis in the heart of Westwood.,"I spent a couple hours here on a sunny afternoon, weaving up and down the rows and looking for famous names. It was fun because not all the superstars' graves were shrouded in memorabilia, as I would have expected (except Farrah Fawcett's, whose was covered in trinkets), so they were a pleasant surprise when I stumbled upon them. The small gardens and relaxing sound of water fountains make you feel like you're at a country estate rather than a busy metropolitan area. I'd definitely recommend this as a way to spend some spare time in Westwood! You won't find it unless you're looking for it, though - just a small path between two large office buildings past Wilshire.",Lindsay B

The hidden entrance is currently near a construction site and kind of looks like an alley way rather than an entrance to a Memorial Park. However once you do make it here, it is completely worth the effort. There are several famous people buried here such as Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Merv Griffin, Rodney Dangerfield, Don Knotts, Eva Gabor, and more. It is nice because the park is small which makes it very easy to find a lost era of greats. My kids and I spent about an hour there and we all found it very interesting.",Caroline L

I think I expected some form of gate or security, buy there wasn't you basically just drive in.I have to say, the cemetery is small, very private and of course quietly respectful. There are many stars laid to rest here...more than I actually expected and the whole area is landscaped and laid out well. Seemed really strange that it is placed bang in the middle of high rise buildings...you hear no traffic...it's so quiet. I did feel a little weird taking photos of memorial stones, benches etc...but workers there didn't say anything or indicate it should not be done. As long as one is respectful, I believe they are ok with it.Oh yes, and you will notice Marilyn Monroe's...it's the only stone discoloured from being kissed from many coloured lips!",Blue30

There were a lot of surprises, such as Fannie Bryce, Dean Martin and Don Knotts. If you are planning a visit, go to the websites and decide your top picks, this one happened to be mine.

There are nice headstones there not like Forest Hill where most all are flats.Just put the address in your GPS, it's there between the buildings.

50,This Place is Full of Our Favorite Entertainers of the Past,"It’s hard to find so be sure to follow directions you can get from a website. We parked in front but saw that others had driven in but we’re still not quite sure where the drive-way was. We naturally looked for Marilyn Monroe’s crypt and it’s near the entry. We were surprised to see a large number of lipstick kisses on her marble front and the empty one alongside. A group of fans had gifted a stone bench nearby with a written message for her. We also searched for Natalie Wood and she was in the ground with a small headstone. I felt a touch of sadness when seeing this. Other crypts and graves were Burt Lancaster, Truman Capote, Farrah Fawcett, Jack Lemmon and many, many more. If you’re wanting a “Hollywood Experience” this is the place to visit. It’s also beautifully landscaped and is very serene. These stars brought us much enjoyment and I feel we honored them by visiting their last resting place.",Bobbye T
40,Very private resting place of the stars,"I made a special trip here to visit Marilyn Monroe's grave for a friend, and boy, did I have a hard time finding the place. If you're driving, the entrance is on Glendon Ave, just below Wilshire, on the east side, between two office buildings. It looks like you'll be driving into an office parking structure, but watch for the ""Dignity Memorial"" sign--you'll drive up a little driveway toward that, and right into the small road that surrounds the park. It's really easy to get lost, and end up in the neighboring residential area. If you get to Wellworth Ave, you've gone too far.Unlike some other Los Angeles cemeteries, Westwood Memorial seems to eschew publicity. There are no maps or flowers available (there's a small florist on Westwood Blvd, but it's a little bit of a walk; it's better to get some beforehand), and the staff appear to discreetly discourage visitors, while never actually turning anyone away. They will leave you alone to wander about. You can take photos quietly, but you'll be scolded if you try to take video.I ran into quite a few stars' graves here, without much effort. Marilyn's was easy to find, and surprisingly bereft of flowers (I gave her one; they probably clear them away every few days). The entire cemetery is small, so you can run your eye over a lot of names, looking for familiar ones, and you'll find some.It's funny that this little, peaceful park is surrounded by the bustle of the most corporate part of Westwood. It's like a metaphor for the private/public lives of some of the stars who are buried here. But there are a few unusual/aged gravestones for people who weren't so well-known in life. You may find them more interesting to look at than the plain markers used for some of the more famous residents.",Christine_U

Please remember to respect not only the other graves, but also other visitors who may be there due to the loss of a loved one. This is certainly not Universal Studios! Other interesting grave sites and designs. The entrance to this memorial park can easily be overlooked as some previous reviewers may have mentioned. One option I would suggest is parking a block or two north in westwood, garb a cup of coffee and walk the few blocks south to the memorial park - this avoids multiple trips around the block.",ChihuahuasMama

50,Hard to find but it was more than worth it!!!,"This place is so hard to find as it is engulfed by office blocks and is a little oasis in the concrete and cement. Our driver dropped us off in the street the park is supposed to be in and we couldn't find it. Thankfully the helpful locals managed to point us in the right direction.This place is a MUST do. Came here specifically to see Marlyn's grave but there are so many, many famous people at rest here. I just wished we had a map (which you can download on the net) before we did come. However, the place is a little haven in the busy area and it was peaceful. Dean Martin, Farrah Fawcett, Natalie Woods and Don Knotts are just a few of the residents here.If you do wish to visit and cannot locate, just ask the local library or any of the locals. Even we were giving directions after we left as someone on the street asked ""Where is Marilyns Grave?"". Her grave stands out amongst the others and is on the first lot of open wall crypts. Just a hint - if you are a fan, take a rose! There was nothing there on the day we went and it made me very sad.",Peterjules

Buried here are some of the biggest names in entertainment and some show on their tombstones that they had a sense of humour.

You are more than free to drive in and look for them, but you could spend hours trying to locate them (unless you did some research ahead of time). Plus, photography is prohibited, though I don’t know how they would enforce this or what they would do if they caught you doing it.Westwood is a much smaller and more manageable sized cemetery. The biggest challenge you’ll have is locating it. It really is nestled among some tall buildings, and even a lot of the people that work in those building aren’t aware that it is there.We drove to the general vicinity of the cemetery and decided to park in a ramp and walk to it. It turns out it was located just around the corner from this ramp. There is room for you to drive into the cemetery and park along the side of the road—which, if you can find it, is the route to take, as it cost us $20 to park for than two hours.I had done some checking online before we went there to see who was buried there (Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Rodney Dangerfield, etc.) and even found a map of the location of graves, which was very helpful. There is no restriction on photography, either.Even though the cemetery is in the middle of a busy city complex, it is still remarkably quiet and peaceful.

Here they are at Memorial Park at the end of their earthly lives. It was a very solemn hour and a half for me, and surprisingly the most worth while way to what I initially thought would be killing time as I was waiting to attend a business appointment in Brentwood.

You will not be able to see it from Glendon Ave. since it is located directly behind the parking garage so drive slowly or you'll quickly pass it.The great thing about the cemetery is it's small size. Once you've decided whose gravesite you want to see, it will be easy to find. Of course Marilyn Monroe's grave is the easiest to locate. She is located at the far end of the cemetary in the wall with many flowers on it placed there almost daily by her fans.The people at the information counter were friendly and helpful in telling us where celebrities like Rodney Dangerfield, Merv Griffin, Farrah Fawcett, and Walter Matthau were located. I won't list all the celebrities buried there since it would take up too much time but you can find a complete listing on their website just like I did befoe visiting Westwood.Plan on spending about 60 -90 minutes there depending on how many gravesites you plan on visiting. Went there in the morning right before visiting the Getty Museum which is only about 20 minutes away.",MichaelFleetwood
50,My favourite West Coast Park,"Watch Rebel Without a Cause before you go. Try to go on a clear day. Right after it rains is perfect! Great City views, feels like nature but such a close drive if you are staying down in Hollywood. And walking the enormous grounds is free!",J B
50,Tranquility among the chaos of LA,This is possibly the most beautiful cemetery I have been to ( outside of Paris ) was beautiful and many stars are interred here! Hard to find but so worth it - it is a must see!,Jenofwaukesha
50,Peaceful,"I made the 7 mile trip from my hotel to Westwood Memorial Park to visit Marilyn Monroe. Westwood is full of many famous and influential people but I has only wished to spend time with Marilyn.I was surprised to find that it is in fact quite a small cemetery, as you walk in Marilyn is interred into the left hand ""wall"" quite near the back. There was fresh flowers left for her, the marble is stained from red lipstick left by her devoted fans. I expected to find a few people there but I was alone. Is sat on the bench in front of her for a long time collecting my thoughts.Westwood memorial park is very quiet and peaceful, definitely worth a visit if you find visit graves something you would like to do on your holiday.I especially recommend this to Marilyn Monroe fans, it might sound strange but I felt a real connection to her that day.",ZoeVengenz
50,Goodbye Norma Jean,"Being a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe I had to visit the park and pay my respects. The park is quite small and not crowded (only a handful people was there during my visit). Besides Marilyn Monroe also Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster and other major stars a buried here. And for bringing a little humor to a memorial park take a look at Rodney Dangerfields grave. The stone states his name and the words 'Here goes the neighborhood'",Kim E
50,Lots of Celebrity Graves Here!,"This is a very small, compact cemetery containing many famous celebrity graves. The staff are very helpful here, unlike the Forest Lawn cemeteries where they will not help you locate a grave at all. Check out grave locations online before visiting to see who's there... Marilyn, Dean, Mel, Natalie, Farrah, Merv... oh so many more! The place is really no bigger than a football field, so an hour is all you need to pay your respects... enjoy!",vakayplannerPa
50,What a beautiful place,"OMG what an absolutely beautiful place! I have never seen such a lovely place. Being a massive Marilyn Monroe fan I just had to visit her crypt whilst in LA. This cemetery is really lovely, there are quite a lot of famous people there for example, Dean Martin, Natalie Wood, Roy Orbison, and of course the wonderful Marilyn Monroe, her crypt stands out a mile with all the red lipstick kisses on it. You can spend ages walking round the beautiful grounds looking at all the crypts and graves. It is definitely worth the trip, I am so glad I went.",marion t
40,"Great for the curious, quiet and not so ""touristy""","I stumbled upon the place by accident.

50,Celebrity Cemetery Doesn't Disappoint,"I'm sorry to say that I visit often because my late partner is interred there. The dreadful owners/managers do everything they can to discourage tourists because - so they say - the families of those buried there feel intruded upon by the tourists. I feel just the opposite. I love the bustle and the feeling of life that pervades this lovely little park when people visit. Thank God there's not much room to add more space, because the greedy owners (not the original owners, the Pierce brothers from whom we originally bought the spaces) keep trying to find ways to buld out, which will spoil the peace and tranquility of this tiny park in the middle of Westwood. As long as the visitors are quiet and respectful, I welcome them, and am always willing to point out Mel Torme, Dominic Dunne's lovely daughter, Frank Zappa, our newest permanent resident Farrah Fawcett, etc., or whoever else they're seeking. Welcome everyone. It's a fun outing if you are a tourist.",LATraveller77

Finding the entrance is very tricky we drove by it many times (the plaque for entrance in on the side of the business building). The park is very small and intimate. Beautifully landscaped. We were there on a Friday afternoon it was peaceful. You can get a map of where all the celebrities are buried.....but most are very easy to find. Most notably is Marilyn Monroe. I was shocked to find all the celebrities. Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Buddy Rich, Truman Capote, Don Knotts, and many more. Its nice to pay your respects to some Hollywood icons. Worth the visit.....free entry and nice bathrooms. Definately a place to visit while in LA. If you are a geocacher .....there is one on the premises.",AdvisorMember35
40,Strange to visit a Cemetery?,"Why is a cemetery a visitor attraction? I'm not sure, but we ended up going. Why? well basically Marilyn Monroe is laid to rest here. Basically just a wall plaque to see, but is was 50 year anniversary of her death when we went, so lots of flowers, etc.Nice quiet place. It's tucked away behind buildings. There is a general pubic carpark nearby. Free to enter. Good if you have an hour to fill and not too far out of your way. I guess a ""must see"" for older fans of MM.",dadofnog

Once your in you will be amazed how many you will see as your just park your car.we parked I looked to my left and right in front. Of me were Merv Griffin,Rodney dangerfield, Walter Matthau and Farrah fawcet. My favorite grave was Don Knotts which has many of his characters on his grave .

50,A Hidden Treasure in West Los Angeles,"Although a bit difficult to locate without an exact street address and a GPS, a visit to Westwood Memorial is WELL worth the effort to get there! I would recommend going on a Sunday afternoon. We virtually had the entire place to ourselves, so we had ample opportunity to peruse and take in the beauty of this place. The grounds are very well kept, and obviously, you'll want to take your camera. If you want to see the graves of specific celebrities, it's worth a little bit of research time online prior to your visit. There are several sites online which tell you how to locate specific gravesites. You cannot visit Westwood Memorial without seeing the names of several well known celebrities, but some graves are unmarked and/or are scattered about sufficiently that finding a grave randomly is difficult. It's nice to take your lunch and simply relax here if you have the time.",Brandon_Olive

It is a very small, well kept circular Cemetary. It is very hard to find. Once you get on Wilshire Blvd turn left into where it says parking garage, it is right before the library, so if you reach the library you have gone too far. When you turn into the area that says parking garage, you are in between tall buildings, just proceed forward, and you will see the sign for the Westwood Memorial Cemetary.Many celebrities are buried here, and it is such a beautiful, peaceful place to pay respects to your favorite icons.Take Care",307JenniferW

50,Peaceful and well hidden oasis,"The Westwood Memorial Park is located right behind the skyscrapers along Wilshire Boulevard and easy to miss because you would not typically expect a cemetery there, where many of the Hollywood celebtities are buried. To find it you need a good guide book and an accurate GPS. The memorial park is for most people known for Marilyn Monroe, but there are also many other celebrities buried there like Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and what is also interesting is just taking the time reading the thoughtful texts on the tomb stones, such as “Jack Lemmon in”.

It is immaculate and a credit to its staff who keep it in first class condition.I found its understated layout and lack of Hollywood pazazz only added to its impact. The choice of anyone wishing to be interred at Westwood is entirely understandable.Hidden away behind skyscrapers not only added to its stark contrast to L.A in general but also kept out noise.The list of famous folk at Westwood is long and worth researching before you go. But if there can ever be such a thing as a world class cemetery then I'm sure Westwood sets the standard.If you have the time then just absorb the serenity that does exist in the areas around the small fountains.Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been to since joining.

I suspect there are more celebrities here per square foot than anywhere.

There is a little alley and the park is tucked away behind the parking structure. You will see a black marble sign on Glendon (entrance to the alley) that says ""Pierce Brothers Westwood village"".I went at 9am on a Thursday morning and the only people there were workers and 2 of then were digging a hole for a grave!

However, we did find it, behind Pierce Brothers' Funeral Home. The graves/ashes of Hollywood stars lay in the beautifully-tranquil and manicured park, which is hemmed in by tower blocks. Though not big, it houses the likes of Mel Torme, Dean Martin, Burt Lancaster, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and of course, Marilyn Monroe.

50,A thoughtful place but difficult to find,"After reading the top things to do in LA and seeing that Jack Lemmon is (buried) here it became a must-see to my trip intinery. Howver the name 'Westwood memorial park' is a little confusing as it is actually named 'Pierce Brothers Westwood Village, Memorial Park and Mortuary' and has a very small sign from the road. Very tucked away turning left from Wiltshire Bld onto Glendon Ave it is between office parking buildings before the library (which is signposted) and if you go passed the CVS pharmacy opposite, then you've gone too far! I don't know what a sar nav comes up with but maps and the name change make it a difficult find - I hope this bridges the gap! Still it was worth the wait, so good to see Jack and Walter just around the corner from each other...but it is serene and a thoughtful place to be. I sat on the block seat next to Jack to just have a moment but the LA heat almost burnt my bum as I jumped up I screamed' That's hot!' my astute husband replied 'well, some like it hot!'

There is only a small sign saying Westwood Memorial and you have to walk or drive into what looks like an alley with parking.

I went from 3 to 4pm and there were only 3 other visitors that whole hour. You can drive around, but I'd recommend walking. You may see some familiar names hidden in gardens. It's a very small cemetery, any shoe type will be fine for walking. It's good to bring a camera but be mindful of those there to mourn. Bring some flowers for your favorite star, a small amount.",Crystal K
50,Great Stop When Visiting L.A.,"My wife and I were driving south from the Bay Area and made a point to visit this site, and we're really glad we did. Another site had given great instructions on finding the entrance, and even then we had to do an extra lap around the block because it is easy to miss. We were there in the early afternoon on a Tuesday off-season at the beginning of March. There were hardly any people there, the parking inside along the curb is free, and the weather was perfect. I am glad I had printed a map of where roughly some of the famous graves are located and written some notes on how to locate some famous unmarked graves as well (George C Scott, Frank Zappa, Roy Orbison).We are not ghoulish people (just fans) and didn't know what to expect but it was a great experience. Altogether, we decided that it's not completely unlike driving past celebs' homes, although this has some advantages: No long-drive searches for locations that congest streets, no wondering if this place REALLY is linked to this person, it's nice being outside, etc.A couple of first thoughts when we arrived: This place is right next to some busy streets and yet is really quiet and peaceful, and it's quite small (if you went to the back wall you could reach right over and touch the roofs of some homes). Also, we were careful to be respectful as we walked around. We didn't dress as tourists and we kept our voices down, although with our camera it was obvious why we were there. Still, the staff never bothered us at all.We were there the day AFTER Jane Russell had died, and someone had left a nice note on Marilyn Monroe's marker referencing their work together. A nice man saw us and spoke with us about the property. Seems this guy works and lives nearby, and he likes visiting Westwood just as others might visit a city park. He is also a fan so he was happy to answer some questions about locations and told us about some of the frowned upon activities (walking your dog, making too much noise, etc.).I am glad I did my research before going so I knew who to find, and the research itself is interesting. The story behind the guy ABOVE Marilyn Monroe is really interesting, for example. Some of the markers are simple (Farrah Fawcett has no dates) and some are funny (Rodney Dangerfield's reads: ""There Goes the Neighborhood""). Overall, it is a nice place to think about the people there and their work that you admire.You can whip through the entire park in 15 minutes if you want but we were there for a couple of hours.It's not everybody's cup of tea, but if you are looking for a nice peaceful diversion for a couple of hours you may be as impressed as we were.",WAID
40,Very serene and respectful to those interred here.,"I visited this place in 2004 and went to Natalie Wood's grave first. I was shocked to see that Steve McQueen's only daughter resting beside Miss Wood!! She got an Oscar nomination starring opposite McQueen in LOVE WITH A PROPER STRANGER in 1962. Also a great friend (and pallbearer) of President Reagan is buried here. Today, just learned that Farrah Fawcett has been laid to rest next to him--Merv Griffin. It's near the office and chapel. And not far from Brian Keith and Dean Martin. Is hard to find in the big city of the Angels but ""angel Farrah"" is now a real one in heaven. This place is a must for cemetery fans, as I am. May all those who rest here receive eternal light and peace in the loving arms of God.",TigerEagle
50,Great group of stars lie here,"There are many famous peope buried in this cemetery, which is small enough that you really don't need a map to find them. As the previous reviewer mentioned however, the cemetery itself is hard to locate. It literally sits in the middle of a block with buildings on all sides.Not only will you find Marilyn, but also her ""Some Like it Hot Co-Star"" Jack Lemmon and his ""Odd Couple"" co-star Walther Matthau. And the chain goes on.",JohnTheBear
50,Very nice place...Very hard to find...,"I am a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe, it was incredibly hard to find. Tricky location, even with a GPS system. You have to turn into what looks like the building parking lot. It is a very beautiful and serene place. Plenty of nice places to sit and view everything. It closes at Dusk so get there before because it's incredibly hard to see at night.",HeidiluvrTx
40,Very peaceful,"We had tried to visit this cemetery once before on a trip to Los Angeles, but arrived after the gates closed. This time we made it in time. (Even though the website we checked said it closed at 5:00 PM. it was actually open later).It is easy to find with a GPS, but difficult without one, since it is squeezed in among tall buildings. The area is very peaceful, and a fitting tribute to the people buried there. I hope they never allow it to be taken up by the huge corporations surrounding it.We saw the gravesites of Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Rodney Dangerfield, Merv Griffin, Bob Crane, Dean Martin, Natalie Wood, Truman Capote, and many, many others. There are nice benches and areas to sit and reflect.Definitely worth a visit.",KLM1
50,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful, serene cemetery. We stop by everytime we're in L.A.. We always visit Natalie Wood's grave. Lots of famous people buried here. I was even able to print out a map that showed whose grave was where.But you dont really need one, the place is quite small. Which makes it even better to visit.",Lovetotravel720
50,Best place to see (dead) celebrities,"A VERYsmall cemetery, somewhat hard to find, but loaded with celebrities. From Marilyn Monroe to Dean Martin, from Fanny Brice to Roy Orbison, from Billy Wilder to Walter Matthau, from Beach Boy Carl Wilson to Darryl Zanuck, from Jack Lemmon to Bob Crane, from Peggy Lee to Burt Lancaster. It was well worth the time.",dianeg1128
