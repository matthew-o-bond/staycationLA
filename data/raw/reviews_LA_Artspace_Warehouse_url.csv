50,love this gallery,This gem was the perfect answer when I hunted for some cool art to fill my walls. Loved the variety of awesome artworks. Most of the pieces fit within my budget with a couple exceptions where I couldn't resist to splurge a bit. I recommend asking to get access to their stock room where I found what I wanted to fill my bedroom and living room walls.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/835dayav
50,"Great, friendly environment to share and buy original artwork","I've been with Artspace for over 3 years as an artist and I've only had one good experience after another. I've sold several pieces and always had fair transactions and generous opportunities. They have single handedly boosted my art career and I've been impressed by the business concept from the beginning, which allows anyone to purchase original art with whatever budget they have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/353courtneyr

50,"love Love LOVE this place - Awesome Art, GREAT price...","They have a selection of contemporary Art - seemingly many European names - from small 6x6 ""tiles"", all the way to ""whole-wall-art"". My Fav: SUZY HUNZIKER's ""wire sculptures"" that remind me so much of Giacometti... Always enjoy meeting either the owner Claudia or her assistant Mona - always smiling and always there with a suggestion for that difficult wall. Artspace has become my place of reference when friends ask me about contemporary Art at affordable prices - with a huge selection of really NICE stuff!. Congratulations - great concept!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgaedeke
50,great affordable original art worth exploring,Artspace Warehouse is a very different kind and totally accessible art gallery. It makes finding nice artworks really fun given that the prices are affordable and there are so many artworks to chose from. Lots of street parking. Also good is the free delivery and hanging when getting some large pieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cdla
