50,Great place for the kids,This is a no brainer if you want your kids to fall asleep exhausted. They provide lots of different options for jump times and duration. They have a smaller area for little kids and great supervision. My kids love it there. There are lots of table and extra seating if you want to bring a laptop and get some work or surfing done while the kids jump.,Dana E
40,Birthday fun!,"Grab your teen girlfriends and have a ball. We had a nice helper. Pizza was brought in from Michaelangelo across thr street, and cake for the birthday. The lids loved it. Be careful jumping and take breaks.",WalkingInLA
50,Fun for the whole family,"What a great place to have tons of fun for family and a workout included. It was cold and wet outside after a rain storm, we wanted an indoor place to let the kids burn some energy. We got coupons to Rockin Jump in San Dimas. So my husband and I decided that's the place to go. When I walked in, my first impression of the center was that it's VERY CLEAN and it doesn't smell. We've been to lots of jumping places and some smelled like stinky feet.We were explained that everyone is required a Rockin Jump sock if you get on the trampoline. It was $2/pair and can be reused for next time. We were also given a colored wrist band which specific our jump time. I wish we knew the jump was by the hour. We had to wait almost 20mins before we can jump. The wait was not fun for the kids. But I understand the specific jump time was to limit the number of jumpers for crowd control. It was a safety regulation.When it was time for us to jump, the group ahead of us with different wrist band color was dismissed from the trampolines. It was nice that the kids got more room to jump. The jumping area is not super big but good size enough for the kids to exhaust their energy. My kids had a great workout and they also had tons of fun. They have been asking when we'll go back and I'm sure it'll be soon. Next time, I'm joining the fun.",Chizy61
50,great place for a child's party,I was there today for my granddaughters 5th birthday party. It was very organized and all the kids had lots of fun. there were about 30 kids with at least one parent. the place has a few fun rooms. at designated times the wholeparty is escorted to the rooms by staff. There are two large rooms with various jumping machines. The last room is the food room where pizza and drinks were served. we brought the chicken and salad. again the staff serves the food and initiates the birthday song. afterwards the staff helps take the gifts out. And they do the cleanup. we helped my son and daughter in law with the cost but I really appreciated we didn't have to worry about set up or clean up.I hope we'll be back for her 6th birthday party.,Svaldez
