40,Beautiful old theatre,"I just came from seeing Johnny Marr at this theatre. So beautiful! Theatres like this are hard to come by these days. It seemed very well maintained and loved. Seats were mostly comfy and upholstery looked really good.I will say though, as a tall person with long legs, sitting in the upper balcony was painful for my knees. I'm certain that days in the past, people may not have had this problem.As well, I'm not certain the air conditioning is 100% working for the kinds of shows this venue hosts now. I was very hot and sweaty by the end of the show and hardly stood up in my seating area at all. Perhaps again, it could be due to that I was high in the back, but I needed a shower after the show.I would certainly not think twice about seeing another show here in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/321christab

50,They just don't build them like this anymore,"We attended a screening of ""Singing in the Rain"" as part of ""Last Remaining Seats"", a program to provide exposure to the art and architecture of the old theaters in LA's theater district. What an opportunity - this building is just stunning and the history is pretty amazing. Definitely worth the trip to the area, but you must coordinate with special events to have inside access.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jackbH7422SM
50,Beautiful Venue,"We attended a private Coldplay concert at the Ace Theater. This place is incredible. The murals & the ornate details of the entire place were stunning. It was a little warm but, it is an older building and LA at the time had record high temperatures. I highly recommend taking a tour of this venue, it is like stepping back in time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626cynt
50,Ace Hotel and Theater is spectacularily beautiful,"The old UA theater has been renovated back to it's early movie star glory with a wide screen and big stage. Inside the stylish Ace Hotel, it's right on Broadway. The theater is amazingly beautiful and a show unto itself. I had a wonderful evening at the LA Conservancy's Last Remaining Seats watching Back to the Future. They even brought the original flying Delorean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
