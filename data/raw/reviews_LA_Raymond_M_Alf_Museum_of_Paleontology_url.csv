40,Great place for kids unless they are differently abled.,Webb School has done a great job making this wonderful dinosaur museum. The only negative is it is not accessible. There are 3 stairs necessary to get into the main floor after a very long walk to and then up a very long ramp. There is no elevator to get to the lower level exhibits. Fix this!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/b1bayer
30,"okay, focused on conclusions","A place my partner wanted to see. It was nice enough, as I am sure other reviewers will detail. Looking at the displays was fine, but afterwards I was disappointed that focus was on conclusions about time and evolution, with minimal information about provenance of the artifacts and how they advance the general body of knowledge.BTW, we came by bus; google maps thought the early/late commuter bus ran all day (which it doesn't) so we had a mile+ hike to get there. Cross-check the Foothills bus schedule to not be surprised!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gophr_Baroque
50,Dinosaurs Dinosaurs Dinosaurs,Who would guess that a small local museum at a private high school would have an international recognized collection of dinosaurs artifacts? But they do. It worth a visit just to see the large stone in the entry way that has the fossil footprints of a small dinosaur or bird.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AnnIreland19
40,Hidden Gem,"We had such a fun afternoon at the Alf Museum. My son loves dinosaurs and was amazed at everything there. They had some fun interactive kid friendly activities like digging for fossils in the tar pit, Dino skeleton building, dinosaur sound making and more. It’s a small place but a must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kimt02
50,We LOVED it!,"We stopped in here while visiting family and had a great time. We were five adults and one toddler and we all learned something new at the museum and the toddler loved every minute. I honestly would have enjoyed staying even longer than we did, it was very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/satellitesue1
40,A pleasant little gem,"This museum is a little gem devoted to paleontology. It is on a high school campus and consists of two floors, one devoted to bones and the other to tracks. Some of the exhibits are actual fossils (many of them were very impressive) and others are casts. The exhibit is notably well labeled in a way that anyone can understand. There is enough information to make the point but not so much to be long-winded or confusing. I’m glad I went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1
50,Jurassic family fun!,"Found this hidden gem after visiting my grandmother in La Verne. How did I not know this place was there? It’s located on the Webb campus in Claremont; such a beautiful campus. Went with my two children (ages 9 & 11). Having just seen Jurassic World last night, I think it made it even better! Upstairs has lots of fossil replicas and downstairs there are more hands on experiences. We even got to see volunteers casting a fossil. Staff was knowledgeable and answered all of our questions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MurrietaMama
50,If you like old bones you’ll love this!,Great little gem in Claremont. The Webb is a closed campus college but the museum is just off the parking lot. It’s not huge but we spent 2 hours there. There are interactives for kids and adults alike. Great footprint tracks. The most traffic was late morning- there were maybe three other families besides us. Free parking but stop in front of the guard house even tho there is no stop sign.Downtown Claremont was the perfect next stop for lunch and shopping and just beautiful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monac204
50,Fun for all ages,"Fun for all ages, this place has been a go to place for my kids since they were in pre school. My boys are 19 and 20 and we go back every now and again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jewelzpedroza
30,good for kids but rather go to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County,"Limited collection, kind of fru fru atmosphere at the Webb School. It's a simple teaching museum, OK for an hour with kids with a limited attention span, but for a real dinosaur exhibit go to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. It's a drive but worth it. Your kids will thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pianisthaohuang
50,Fun place,"Bring your kids to learn about science, history and dinosaurs. It's great for an hour, or two. Brand new and nice. Some Saturdays are Open House.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA

50,"Small, But Very Well Done","I was unsure of what a museum on the grounds of a high school would be like. My son and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Although it is small, what they have is very interesting and good quality. There is just enough to make a nice visit of about an hour. You can take your time and read about all of the exhibits and not feel overwhelmed like you can at a major museum. It is impressive that many of the fossils were found by students of the Webb School.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mom_of_Alex

50,Small museum with a big story,If you are interested in how the earth came to be as it is this small museum should be on your list of things to see in the Pomona Valley. It tells the story of life on this planet from long before the dinosaurs up through our recent Ice Age and to the present. The remarkable thing about this museum is that much of the paleontology work has been done by students at Webb school. The exhibits and presentation our first class and professionally done. This is an amazing place to spend a couple hours and is quite friendly for children over the age of about five.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Geog_Guy
40,Family adventure,A good way to spend time with the kids. Getting to know our past and realize how time has change. There is a $6 dollar fee to get in cash or check.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadineo341

Good for the whole family, except very young children. Lots of hands-on exhibits to entertain all. A rare find.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/61bruins61

40,Worthwhile - check schedule,"Small but very interesting exhibit and, I believe, the only paleontological museum curated by a high school, The Webb Schools.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mach2pt2
30,Small but informative,"I went to the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology because it's just a few minutes from where I live, and I am a big fan of Natural History. This is a very small museum, located on a small campus of a private school, so don't expect too much. It took us about an hour to go through everything. I was impressed at the student involvement and the videos of the actual trips they took (I wish I had gone to school here!). There were a few interactive exhibits for smaller children, although this museum would probably be more appropriate for older children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thejlt
50,A GEM,If you have an interest in paleontology you have to come here. Even though it is on a private high school campus it is very well done and a great intorduction to the subject.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wynnejones
30,High School Students: That Says it All,"This place is inexpensive and is located near a private high school whose students are said to work on some of the exhibits. The problem is that what it really needs more docents who know what they are doing. Some of the exhibits are interesting, but the quality of presentation is what you would expect from high schoolers. If you are into paleontology this would be a good place to visit. It would also be of value if you wanted to show children a little bit about the science. Priced right and worth a visit,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thecarfamily
50,The Only High School in the US with a Paleontology Museum,This is a fascinating museum and definitely worth a visit. It is recently renovated and has extensive exhibits. It is a fun place to take young children as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FLB

50,Local Gem,"This museum is a find! Students have worked on many of the exhibits - engaging, informative and interesting!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveler5_10

40,Only Accredited High School Museum in The USA!,"The Alf is a fascinating small paleontological museum on The Webb Schools campus. Student and professionally produced displays highlight dinosaur and other fossil discoveries by students on trips throughout the world-Mongolia, Utah, Madagascar, Wyoming, Colorado. Very interesting for children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karenmac44
50,Unexpected Gem,"What I find inspiring is that many of the fossils on display at this little museum on the Webb Schools campus were discovered by the students and teachers. The museum has one of the finest collection of fossil footprints, which were collected by Raymond Alf, a teacher, and his students. The museum's programs continue to promote exploration and discovery of new species.The museum's displays have been recently renovated which includes hands on exhibits for kids. The museum charges a small admission fee, but there are days when it is free. Also, it is closed on school holidays and vacations, so check the schedule before going.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acscf
40,Small discovery,"On the Webb High school campus, it's a small but very well set up museum. There are some interactive areas for kids and some very interesting archeological finds and history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Teacherdeb1
40,Can be Easily Overlooked,"I did not even know this place existed before the day of my visit. It is small but information is presented so very well. I had Paleontology in college to qualify for a minor in Natural Sciences, so seeing so many of the things here brought back wonderful memories or that class and our digs and fossil hunts. The artifacts are displayed to their best advantage; and the dinosaur foot print is a real draw for kids. Remember that this museum is on a school site, so check before going; but it is well-woth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MonaOrangeCountyCA
40,History and Memories in the Making,Loved this place when my daughter was little. Family Day is best because it's free and there are lots of relevant and fun activities.

40,WOW!,This museum is on the grounds of the Webb school and is only open certain hours so check before you go. It is small but has some very nice exhibits for a private museum. They also offer educational classes and summer school mini classes here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimCa
40,Digging for Dinosaurs,"FREE every Wednesday, Parking is FREE. $3 per person, 4 and under FREE. No strollers, but they have parking station for them.My toddler and I enjoyed the museum. My toddler favorite things were the dinosaurs, downstairs they have a discovery section that you pull down a lever to hear the sound of a dinosaur, looking at the mirror and comparing the size of himself to the dinosaur, and digging for fossils.This is a 1-2 hour museum. Not crowded.What we did to make it a day was go to Memorial Park in Claremont and had a picnic lunch - they have a wading pool for the kids during the summer months from 11:30am - 1:30pm. After lunch headed over there.[---]",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socalpcktmemories
