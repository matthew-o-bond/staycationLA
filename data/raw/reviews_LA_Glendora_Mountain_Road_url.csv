50,Quick Getaway to Natural Beauty,"The ride up Glendora Mountain Road (GMR) offers beautiful views of the local San Gabriel Mountains. On clear days, you can also get a spectacular sight of the San Gabriel Valley. My son and I drove up on a Saturday morning to hike the Northern portion of the Upper Monroe Truck Trail. The road is a twisting, winding, stomach-churning ride into the mountains. It can be a dangerous ride because you are sharing the narrow road with motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, and joggers, along with other motor vehicles. There are many turnouts for parking to enjoy the views or explore one of the many hiking trails. The road will continue to the East Fork of the San Gabriel River. It is currently closed to Mt. Baldy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NuclearGuy
50,The Great Escape,"Glendora Mountain Road, or more commonly know as GMR by locals is a great escape from the grind of every day living.Great road for a scenic car drive or even better yet a motorcycle ride.And the hiking trails that are all along the roadway are a great way to spend a couple of hours decompressing and working up a little sweat.GMR is a quick mini vacation you can put yourself in from your doorstep with in a few minutes time, if you live local of coarse.From my desktop in my home office to deer grazing in minutes, the Great Escape!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garyr329
50,Incredible view - especially at sunset,"If you are looking for a spectacular view, this place is worth the long drive. Make sure the bladders of your kids are empty because there are no restrooms up there. Also, don't let the kids wander away from you too far because there are wild animals in this area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnalfred2018
50,Great ride...,"I ride my Harley and it's an awesome ride, I usually get there at 9am on a WEEKDAY, it's about an hour ride from the turn off from my baldy village , very little traffic at that time, I puts some pics up, I have seen deer on several occasions, it's a calm relaxed ride, very little traffic, it's a very close trip from my home in Alta Loma it clears my head and feels like I'm far away, its a quick close round trip , enjoy it and take care of it for all.... thanks",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wooll1551
50,Wonderful bike ride (motorized or pedal)...,"Only, go during the week... too many ""speedsters"" on the weekend. Lots of turnout to stop and admire the views .. and there is much to behold!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gsN5694IB
40,It's all about the view,"I've taken my kids and grandkids up the road and into the canyon for hikes. No facilities, so be prepared for that. In the evening, the view of the San Gabriel valley is awesome. The kids spent a good 15 minutes trying to pick out places they knew from the view. Finally found something that engaged them off of their devices and it was a short drive from my home in Covina",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X9798YCdianac
50,Potentially a Thrilling Drive (lost of curves) with Superb Views!,"I've driven GMR off and on for decades. My Driver's Ed instructor took us up GMR and it was a good place to learn to drive on a very curvy road. It hasn't changed. Not a great place to go if you're in a rush to get from here to there, and definitely not a fun place to drive when it's wet and slippery.That said, it can be a fun drive, especially in a sports car with a low center of gravity.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CP220
50,Hiking trails,Lots of trails to choose from at different levels of challenge. Pretty clean but some paths are better groomed than others.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monique318
50,Glendora mountain road Trails,If you like to hike there are many trails all around. My favorite is at the corner of glendora Mtn rd / dalton springs. Begin with “poop out” to “punk out” this is a considered difficult and a great work out. There are many others not as difficult. You can find maps at trail heads.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q9286UZdawnh
50,Scenic Drive all along.,"This is Very scenic drive all the way to Mount Baldy on one side or to East Fork of the Azusa Canyon on Hwy 39, either way is very scenic with many look out points. Beware of thrill seekers Motorcyclists and motorists alike as this road is famous for accidents, also drive slowly to avoid fallen rocks. Please avoid weekends if you want to really enjoy the ride. Do not forget your Binoculars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/adam873
50,Nice mountain road,There are many nice views from this road but you must be careful as this is a dangerious road with many curves and steep dropoffs. Drive slow and carefull. Nice place to see wild tarantulas.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennisn473
40,Biking the Glendora Mountain Road,Ride the Glendora Mountain (Ridge) Road on a cool Fall day. When you reach the fork n the road you can continue to Mt Baldy Village or return on the East Fork road through Azusa Canyon to Azusa. Either way you are rewarded with spectacular views. On a clear day you may be able to see Catalina Island.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U7217NBjohns
40,Nice Views of the San Gabriel Valley,"This is about a 24 mile road with lots of curves, including many hair-pin curves. It's open most of the year except when fires are going or there is a high fire risk.I would drive it when it's below 80 degrees out to avoid overheating. This road is in good condition but many accidents occur on it. Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brproactive
40,Glendora Mountain Road Drive,"Glendora Mountain Road (GLM) is a winding mountain road that can either lead to Mount Baldy or to the Azusa Canyon Hwy 39. It is very popular for bicycle, motorcycle and car enthusiasts because of the demanding road. It also popular with families who want to stop in it's many turnouts for the views. It is quite busy Fridays through Sundays, so I would recommend going on weekdays. Please ride or drive within your ability as there are many accidents due to the type of road it is. I live on the base of GLM and have seen many rescue vehicles go up. However, I would not consider it any more hazardous than a typical mountain road.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kwokster1
50,Beautiful scenery,"Great drive, it was cloudy when we got high up but we still had some really great views. An unfortunate amount of trash at the pullouts. Took awhile, not for those easily carsick, but this road was my favorite part of a trip to LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z5198HQrobertp
40,Pretty Views of the San Gabriel Valley,"I've lived in the area for a while but hadn't really gone up this road. It's a typical winding road up and down the mountains in the Angeles National Forest, that takes you to the East Fork Rd. and to the Glendora Ridge Rd. There are some pretty views of the San Gabriel Valley along the way up from its starting point in Glendora; and to the north, it affords you a glimpse of the backcountry mountains.It's a two-lane road only, so be careful, especially in the mornings since you will share the road with cyclists and motorcycle riders (Saturdays) that like to go up and down this curvy road. At night, it can get even more treacherous, mainly because local kids go and test their souped up rides a la fast and furious. One night, while I was camping close to the road, the roaring of engines racing up and down this road high jacked the peace and quiet of an all starry cool spring night in the mountains.This road is a less traveled, yet still great, entry way to the wilderness we have as a backyard here in the east San Gabriel Valley.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricsandimas
50,Be Careful - Beautiful but dangerous,"If you are in the area and want to see some epic views, go to GMR. On a clear day this place is absolutely stunning, we would go there often as great views NEVER get old",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrewR71
40,Glendoras little hidden gem,"I enjoy hiking, riding, or even a picnic in Glendora mountains. Known for its scenic views and steep canyons it is peaceful place to get away and take in the sounds of nature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A3811WEannb
50,"Love the Hiking, Watch out for the skateboarders.",Close to home so nice to have this in my backyard. Love hiking the Glendora Ridge Road. Great views of the city and the back country. Easy to moderate hiking on this fire road.Believe it or not these guys on long boards ride the road from the top down to the National Forest sign. That takes courage.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P6502CDjohnp
10,Need for speed,Lots of cops!!!Cyclist and pedestrians everywhere!The roads are not properly maintained!Lots of gravel and debris on the the road?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/groovedude2017
50,Is this Scotland???,"We found this by accident when driving to the bottom of azusa ave. from West Covina. What a magnificent mountain circular road leading past a huge ""hoover""style dam. There are many picture spots.The landscape resembles the Scottish Cairngorms in parts. Please do not miss this wonderful sight which can be driven round leisurely in around 1.5 hours. Good weather required.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dennissU1613AA
50,GMR.,This winding mountain road begins in Glendora and takes you to Azusa. The beauty of our mountains is so peaceful . In about an hour you can see the Dam and East Fork . The road is well cared for and safe to enjoy. There are many turn-outs to stop and take pictures. Any kind of weather is good but remember when it's dark there are no street lights. Enjoy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindasX4650MS
50,Great day out,"Glendora Mountain Road, or GMR as the locals call it, is a great place to get away from the smog and heat of the valley, especially if you're on a motorcycle. If you know the roads or use a GPS this is a great start to take the 'long way around' to places like Mount Baldy or Azusa Canyon. There are places to stop along the way to quest your thirst",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/QbanRuben
50,Beautiful but dangerous,"A beautiful but dangerous drive. Plan on going slow, keeping your eyes on the road and if you are the driver focusing on driving. Narrow, winding and beset by motorcycles looking for thrills, this is not the drive to do east to west at sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patchyboy
30,A Different Path,"Glendora Mountain Road, also known as GMR, isn't the fastest way to get to Mt. Baldy, but is a road less traveled than the direct routes via Claremont or Upland. We last took it in June 2016 as part of our fishing trip. It's well maintained, but VERY winding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GlenDimas
50,"GMR for bicycles, motorcyclists or automobiles","GMR is a technical cyclists, motorcyclists dream but it is too narrow to carry all three vehicles at the same time. I am a qualified Colorado Ride the Rockies cyclist and motorist. I do not recommend using GMR for any of the three vehicles on GMR for experts because the vast majority of GMR users are amatuers. Skip GMR if you are an expert. Extreme frustration with the amateurs will be avoided. Also, it has little or no trees so avoid summer heat. Spring mountain flowers are lovely",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RogueContrarian
50,GMR highway,All sorts of sport addicts use this mountain to enjoy their passion from cyclist to different types of bikes motorists. Extreme downhill long boarding to average joe in a simple car. GMR is the place for you if you dare not only to dodge the other sports fanatics but also watch out for law enforcement giving ya a hefty fine if you don't follow the rules of the highway . That being said does not stop the eager passionate person that loves to live for the ride; this beautiful highway in the mountains. Good luck and don't forget to know your skill well. Lots of deaths have and continue to happen on this highway. Enjoy life,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Fungrl
10,road of death and injuries,"while there are scenic views to sides of this road that are cool, this Model A car size road is dangerous thanks to those individuals who become careless on what ever mode of transport they have, when i was working we drove large trucks here and have been tailgated, cut off, and near head ons while on this road, one individual on a skate board got run over recently . there has been countless over the side wrecks through the years, even suicides. i do not recommend this road for pleasure driving from my view as a 43 year professional driver. Arcadia park is more scenic with trees and lots easier to get to and safer drive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/homerlong
50,Glendora Mountain Road in the San Gabriel Mountains,"Glendora Mountain Road has been a constant in the years I have lived in the San Gabriel Valley. It's a nice drive if you don't mind narrow & curvy. The view from both sides of the ridge top is beautiful. On a clear day you can see the Pacific Ocean.Weekends can be crowded with bike riders, motorcycles, cars. Driving when it's crowded requires paying attention to on coming traffic. Wanna be racers like to test their skills endangering others. Law enforcement has increased their presence in response.If you locate the fire road, it's a nice hike on a wide dirt trail. Take water & a camera. As always, watch for rattle snakes. I saw tarantulas during mating season in abundance, but they were not interested in me. Bears, mountain lions, coyotes, rabbits, skunks and more live there so pay attention.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/glendoratraveller
50,I hope you do not use,This is my coolest road to ride my motorcycle hands down. I hate to tell you because I want it the way it is with very little use by others. So if you read this and enjoy a great drive be sure to try it just do not tell anyone else OK.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mikerH2937ID
50,The View from Glendora Mountain Road,The sunrise or sunset is gorgeous viewed from not too far up Glendora Mountain Road.Try it sometime you will love it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MountainViewMom
30,Peaceful,Can be a nice place to collect your thoughts. When you're at that altitude it can put things into perspective. We just drove up the mountains and parked at a couple of spots to get the views. So I really enjoyed taking the time to come here but I don't recommend coming here if you're not already in the area. If you drove for more than 20 minutes you might be disappointed.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iparker5611

If you stay on Glendora Mountain Road it will drop you off in Glendora. If you turn right on Glendora Ridge Road you can take to Mt. Baldy Rd where a couple of nice restaurants are. You can take Mt. Baldy Rd down to Upland with easy access to the 210 FWY,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredIBEW

50,A must for any motor enthusiast!,"This surely has to be one of the most stunning drives on the planet!! I came upon this road by total accident, I hadn't heard of it at all... This is maybe a good thing that it isn't hugely well known outside the USA... Go ahead take a drive to see it! It's well worth it! Do however take it easy, it is curvy it is steep and it is treacherous if you approach it in any other manner than a cautious one! Have fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arfur81
50,Cool country drive in the city,We just took this ride for the first time from Glendora around to Azusa..what a surprise. We felt like we were out in the country-a real breath of fresh air. Didn't know there were parks and recreational areas there...just hoped we didn't have a flat tire as it is truly rural.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dbajet
40,Nice drive,"This is a really terrific place to take out-of-town visitors for a drive, both because it gives them a good idea of what the area looked like before it was developed, and also because of the great vistas it offers. A bit tricky to drive in a big suv.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura

20,It's more of the same...boring!,We were hoping to really get in the mountains (we are from North Idaho - and we HAVE mountains and were feeling a little homesick after 2 weeks on the road).
