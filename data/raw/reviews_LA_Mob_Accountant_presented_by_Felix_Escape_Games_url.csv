50,Awesome immersive game!,"Super fun, immersive, great puzzles, and excellent attention to detail!We called ahead, and they were able to get us in on an odd schedule, given they had no previous booking for that hour. A bit hard to find—no obvious signage—but they gave us good directions over the phone. Game master was very entertaining, and at the end of the game, gave us a full rundown of everything, including historical context. HIGHLY recommend!",Peter S
50,Fantastic experience!,"I absolutely and highly recommend this escape room! We had three adults and two kids ... and all of us were fully engaged and had a really fun time.I won't give any details, as I don't want to give anything away. But from the moment we knocked on the door, our mobster/host (I believe his name was Jeremy) was in full character; and unlike other escape rooms, he accompanied us in the room for the whole hour. He was ""present"" just the right amount ... letting us work on our own and not interfering ... but also thoughtfully giving us informal ""nudges"" when appropriate (so we wouldn't spin our wheels), and also bigger ""hints"" when we needed them to make steady progress. The result was that we were challenged at exactly the right level. Our host smartly let us think, move forward and solve the puzzles in our own time and at our own pace. But we were never so stumped that it was frustrating. That's a really difficult balance to strike in escape rooms, in my view; and our host did a wonderful job helping us along -- and making us laugh at the same time!Regarding the clues, I won't say anything specific, of course ... but they were very creative and satisfying to solve; and it's clear they spent a lot of time thinking about them in the context of the whole experience.Hoping that Jeremy/team launch a new room soon!Brian",BrianTennis123
50,So much fun!!!,Great time for everyone. Challenging but everything is fair game. I would most definitely recommend!,Chris Garrido
50,Great Escape room Experience,Just got out of Mob Accountant and it was a blast! The puzzles were very challenging but very fair. There are 2 goals: to escape the room and to find all the money. There were plenty of hidden surprises that made this small room seem almost ENDLESS. Very fun activity for the whole family.,AJL
50,Mob Accountant,"This is the best escape room experience that I ever had. We were able to score $190,000 with 14:35 remaining. It was a pretty tough room with lots of creative puzzles and quality story telling. The acting was convincing and once started, you get sucked into it’s world. It was a very fun experience and I recommend it to beginners and advanced escape room goers alike.",justin
50,Find the cash and dash!,This room was well themed from the moment you meet the game master to when the game is over. There was a lot of thought put into the room and it had some unique puzzles. Having an actor in the room always adds a unique element. I would recommend this room and can’t wait to see what they come up with next.,ktripeny
50,Another great Escape Room Experience,My husband and I absolutely loved it! It was challenging yet fun. We will definitely be back for the next one!,Rose Polidore
50,Lots of fun; highly recommend!,"This escape room was a lot of fun! The mechanics for hits was unique, and our host Jeremy was fantastic! I highly recommend this escape room.",Brandon Kerr
50,Great Escape Room,This Escape Room was a lot of fun. Very immersive with the theme from beginning to end. The puzzles were challenging enough for someone like me who has gone through 30+ escape rooms. The puzzles flowed well. The Game Master was extremely talented and kept my group entertained. This was my first experience having the game master locked in the room with us. This is one of my favorite escape rooms. I would definitely recommend.,Angela M
50,Great Room,This room has a great back story and well thought out puzzles. The side game of trying to find all the money is fun. The game master is great and witty with his clues. It's not super high-tech but the puzzles actually work and make sense. I would recommend this room to anyone.,Quest59577658021
50,Great Escape room in the South Bay,"I was so excited to hear that a new escape room had opened in the South bay. We've done about 20 escape rooms and this one did not disappoint. We thought the theme was well done, there new twists that we haven't seen done before, and overall thoroughly enjoyed the experience.This room was the first we experienced where the game master stayed in the room. At first I wasn't sure if I would like this aspect, but it definitely ended up adding to the hint portion of the game and the overall experience.Although this room was not like the super high tech rooms with the ""wow factor"" that you might find in other places, it was kind of refreshing to just have a room with good puzzles that flowed. In addition, Jeremy (co-owner) was an awesome and really played his role well. I would definitely recommend this room to others.",mokim0ki
