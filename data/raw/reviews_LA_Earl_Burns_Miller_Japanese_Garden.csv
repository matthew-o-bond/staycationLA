50,Delightful Small Quiet Garden,"What a pleasant small setting. A great blue heron landed and fished in the pond and humming birds abounded. Lovely blossoms were drifting like a gentle snow beautifully landing on some of the greenery. Plenty of places to be present, contemplate, and be.

50,A little piece of tranquility in the heart of CSULB,"The garden is small, surrounding a koi pond with a host of gorgeous, inquisitive fish waiting to be fed with the food provided as part of your admission.

40,"Small, but Delightful","Feeding with the supplied food that comes with your $4.00 admission at the koi pond was fun. The floral displayed and plentiful seating made the place quite relaxing. Also, the paths were well kept and the quietness of the place make it a nice retreat.",Joseph C
50,Wonderful Memories,"We lived in the Long Beach area for many years and had visited the Japanese Garden many times. We returned on a trip on May 21 and went for a nice visit. To our surprise, parking and entry fees were waived for CSULB graduation. There were some graduates in cap and 2019 cords wandering with us to have their pictures taken.The garden is marvelous and it was so nice to wander slowly and enjoy the views with an occasional stop on a bench. There appeared to be 3 generations of koi fish. We spent a peaceful hour enjoying the experience.CSULB should be very proud to have such a marvelous park on the college grounds.",casaahha

30,"Nice garden, big hassle.","First, this is a really lovely garden, well worth the visit. It's very small, but it's so well designed and laid out, that it feels spacious. Upon entering, you feel the tranquility in your bones. The plantings are lovely, and there are a great many happy, fat koi to watch and feed. It's delightful. The $5 entrance fee seems to be something kind of recent, but frankly, if they need to to keep the place in pristine condition, then it's money well spent. The bad part, and for me it was quite bad, was that you need to pay for parking, and it wasn't clear to me that there was any option but a day pass from the university lot...which is $8! No thanks. The person I was with had seen the garden, so told me to go in and they'd circle while I had a look around. If there's other cheaper parking options, there needs to be better indications, because I certainly never saw it. This knocks a couple of points of my rating.",venckman2017

My niece also got married there.The gardens are very well kept, and most wedding ceremonies take place either on the bridge or the wooden platform that overlooks the pond. It's larger than most people realize, and they have a little area for changing and privacy. And since I'm a Long Beach wedding officiant, it's very easy for me to get there.It's one of those best kept secrets in Long Beach as most residents don't even know it's there. Watch for their origami festival. My kids loved it! But mostly, if you're looking for a place to meditate or to relax, it's perfect.",OfficiantGuy-com

50,More koi per square meter,"Finally had an opportunity to visit the Japanese Garden at CSU Long Beach, since it is not open on Saturdays. Parked across the street. Beautiful, compact garden and pond, meticulously kept. Despite being able to hear traffic noise, this oasis is like another world. Once inside, you can't really see the parking lots, and buildings of CSULB. Lots of benches and chairs give you excellent views of the pond, which takes up most of the garden, the meditation garden of gravel, and the nicely balanced vegetation. There are water lilies blooming, Japanese maple (both male and female), and lots of other interesting plants. I've been a sucker for koi since I was a boy, and I have never seen more koi per square meter, than at this pond. There are plenty of beautifully colored adult koi, and masses of young koi. Tossing food to the youngsters creates a storm of orange, red, white, and black. Amazing and captivating. There is also a resident blue heron that is so comfortable with humans that it lets people come to within a few feet of where it's standing. I won't tell you why it hangs around, but the docents can clue you in. Even though we live in West Los Angeles, we were so enthralled that we decided to become members at a reasonable fee. Come to find out that becoming a member gives you reciprocal visiting rights at hundreds of member gardens across the country. Looking forward to visiting more gardens, and coming back to this one.",randylee223
30,"Bad start, good ending","Wanted to share the EBMJG with some good friends. Knew about the new charges for admission starting 1/1/2018, so I checked on line and all web pages indicated admission was FREE. I had visited in January and discussed the admission charge with one of the docents and she indicated there was some flak about the change. So when I viewed the web page the night before visiting it indicated admission was FREE, I assumed it changed. When I arrived at the short-term parking, I saw the sign listing the admission cost, hmmm. Then trouble hit with the parking meter/robber. I started the transaction and it died after taking $2 of mine. Called the trouble number and informed them of the problem and the young man (student?) suggested using down loading the parking app (I don't have a smart phone) or using the general parking and pay station ($8 vs $6 for the short term parking at the EBMJG). I suggested to him that they stop checking the short term parking lot since there was only 90 minutes available time at the EBMJG before closing. The young man said he couldn't do that as the parking citation office was separate from his function. He put me on a long hold to talk to his supervisor and we gave up and gave them another $8 for distant parking. Hi-Tech campus can't keep the money takers operating, sad. Then to the garden and fortunately the money taker there (a personable young lady - student) waved the entrance fee for all 4 of us as I complained that the EBMJG web master was not doing his job and the pages I viewed the night before indicated admission was free. This young lady took charge of the situation and made the guest happy - KUDDOs! Seems like fewer large Koi and a lot more algae than what I saw in January.",SoCal-CDS

50,No longer free. (:^(,"My friend and I often visit the EBM Japanese Gardens at Cal State Long Beach on our Sunday bike rides through Seal Beach. These intimate and photogenic gardens are a true gem which I prefer even over larger Japanese gardens like the one in Woodley Park. We would enjoy kicking back and watching the large, colorful koi, the feisty ducks and beautiful landscaping, all for free!But all good things must come to an end. Starting January 23, 2018, EBM will charge $5 admission for adults, $4 for seniors and LBSU alumni, $2 for youth and free for kids under 4. I guess the 50¢ cost for fish food from the dispenser machine wasn’t cutting it. What a bummer! I feel the cost is a bit high considering the size of the gardens and most people will probably stay for less than an hour. I hope someday to revisit the EBM Japanese Gardens. Perhaps they’ll have a free day once a year or something. Sadness all around.",pingvuiini

There are plenty of large Koi, and the staff tend to leave fish food out for visitors. My kid loves going here and feeding the fish, and there is an area near the beginning where you can get close to the Koi without a fence in your way.As a heads up, parking is not free and make sure you bring change and/or your credit card to pay the meter to avoid getting a ticket.",baronvonstames

40,Small Garden with Huge Potential,"I came to this garden the Sunday of my trip on a whim actually. It was near the motel I was staying at while checking out the area. The garden is small, but very calming. As others have stated, entrance is free, but you need to pay to park. Very limited space at the meter parking so those spaces go fast. Everyone else needs to pay the $5 space for the day. I did that on my visit. The payment machine takes cash in ones and fives or by credit card. The machine was picky this day with another person's card so I paid the cash. You put the parking ticket on the window of your car. The first thing you notice when you step inside the garden is the large koi pond with ducks. There is a booth on the left side as you enter that serves sort of like an informal visitor services desk that was manned by a group of people that looked like a mixture of staff and students. Just beyond that booth is a gumball machine that takes quarters only to give people a handful of koi food to feed the fish and ducks. There is also a crane that at first glance you think it is fake, but it is real. The grounds intertwine with bonsai trees, small water features, sand sculpture area, tea house, bridges, cherry blossoms, lanterns, bamboo, flowers, and benches. Most people could tour this garden in less than an hour unless attending for an event. There were many folks there checking out the grounds as a potential wedding/reception venue. There was a staff from a wedding/event planning company on premise for questions and to book such events on the spot. As a tourist, I would say the garden wasn't all that special and would not be worth going out of your way to see. Though if I were a student or potential student there, I would take full advantage of these beautiful grounds. There is a lot you could do with the garden. For events, they would definitely need to be small. Though nice, it is a compact space and not enough for large affairs. As a proper tourist attraction, the garden needs more for visitors to feel that the trip was worth it to see. It is lovely and calming as most people say. I just feel that, as it is currently, seeing it once was enough for me. If I were a student there, resident within walking distance, or looking to host an event for less than seventy people then I would definitely take full advantage of the garden. :)",Sweettooth
20,"Nice Little Garden, but not Worth a Special Trip","This is a well-designed garden that packs a lot into a small 1.3 acre format. The topology is flat, and centered around a relatively large pond, so there are few intimate spaces and the feeling is not that interesting. The finely crafted 4.5 tatami tea house is somewhat raised, but the layout within the garden is very limited by the available space.The construction (e.g., bridges, walkways, pond) is modern and designed for durability and ease of maintenance rather than authentic Japanese appearance. The pines are well pruned, but the remainder of the gardening is of poor quality.The pond is quite large and has some nice koi. You can buy koi chow to feed the fish (and ducks). The water is fairly clean and clear, but it allows one to see the ugly pipes, planters, and other untilities just under the surface. The shoreline of the pond is just cement with few stones.........looks arificial and ""park-like"" rather than the traditional Japanese craftsmanship and stonesetting. In some areas the pond edging employs an excessive amount of fake wooden posts (gogan-kui) that are actually made of unattractive cement. Robust and easy to maintain, but ugly and unnatural.What really bothered me was the lack of quality stones. Here they used brown sedimentary stones that are cheap to obtain and easy to set, something that one does not see in Japan, and something that just doesn't look good. Worse are the fake hand-crafted cement stones. Really??? These look bad and ruin the appearance and feeling of the garden. The Sakuteiki says that the most important item in the garden are the stones, and this garden implementation ignores that completely. Sad, because with some quality stones and expert setting, this could be a very fine garden.As a garden reviewer, it is my job to be critical. But I should say that if you are in town, this garden is nevertheless pleasant and worth a visit. The entrance is free, but you have to pay a couple bucks for parking.",pontevecchio56

40,"Gorgeous garden, the layout is a bit awkward for events","I lived next to the Japanese gardens for four years, and my graduation ceremony took place here (I was on a scholarship at CSULB). The gardens are always beautiful and well maintained, it's a lovely place to visit. The only critque I have is that if you are planning an event, there are no large spaces for say, seating or a dance floor. I know that some people have had wedding at this venue, but I would find it difficult. To be honest, I would say that many pictures of the venue are a bit misleading. Not regarding it's beauty, the gardens are gorgeous, but often promo pictures show a panoramic view of the location. It isn't necessarily an easy place to hold an event, but it can certainly be done.",Abbiechan
50,the place to go and relax,I loved feeding the koi and watching the ducks fight for the food. I think i took more photos showing the care the workers put into maintaining the site than the fish.

If you are a lover of Koi and or Japanese horticulture, you will enjoy a visit at the place of peace and beauty.",rodvilencia
40,Great Location,"We went there for a wedding. It is a very relaxed, romantic, beautiful, serene garden only a.few feet from a busy street- a hidden gem. The staff was friendly and helpful. However, the location only had one single use (one toilet) bathroom. Many of the 100 wedding guests could be seen doing the ""gotta go"" dance as they waited in line to use the bathroom.",Laura G

50,Beauty & Tranquility,"A gem in Long Beach....maybe I shouldn't tell you about this beautiful spot on the CSULB campus. No matter the time of year, this garden will transport you to another place. Peaceful, beautiful, always changing with the seasons, it will charm you.It is often used as a setting for weddings and other special events. Children love the opportunity to feed the Koi fish in the large central pond.This is a very special place, that you will want to return to often.",RansomNote
40,"Very nice, but very small garden; avoiding crowds will boost your enjoyment","This is a beautiful Japanese garden, but very small. It took me under 20 minutes to stroll over the entire grounds. I would have stayed longer to take photos, but there were hordes of people everywhere on an 85-degree day. It seems families like to go there to hang out on the banks of the pond for hours. Individuals like to sit around and contemplate their SmartPhones. This was my first visit, and I think I picked a bad time. I definitely want to go back on a weekday when there are fewer people.Hope you find these tips helpful:(1) From Bellflower Boulevard the intersection you are looking for is Beach Drive. Go east and take your first left. From Atherton (north of the CSULB campus) look for Earl Warren Drive and go south. There are “Japanese Garden” signs leading the way.(2) If at all possible, find the meters in the parking lot right across from the garden. $2 for an hour; that’s plenty. Otherwise, it’s $5 for a day; that’s overkill.(3) The koi fish in the pond are humongous. I suppose that’s because there are dispensers offering up fish food. Kids will feed fish continually, and their parents will wait for them, so if you want to stroll near the pond don’t trip over the youngsters.(4) This would be a superb place for photography, so if you have camera in hand, go right at the noon opening on Sunday (closed Saturday) or simply stick to a weekday (8:00 am – 3:00 pm, Tues thru Fri).",Jim L
50,Beautiful,"A wonderful garden on the grounds of California State University Long Beach. It's well taken care of with staff and volunteers around should one have questions. The large pond has huge koi. A blue heron was trying to have a feast, but was unsuccessful.",pamd927
50,quiet and peaceful,"quiet and peaceful, have been here many times, lots of koi fish, small walking area, beautiful trees and vibe. great for date, photos or just hang out",BuenoOrNot
50,A Nice Place to Stop By With The Family,"We stopped by here on my 45th birthday. It's a nice place to get a touch of nature in the middle of an urban area. The focal point is a koi pond. You can buy food for a quarter to feed them. You can stroll around the pond in a nice garden with a couple of bridges and some benches where you can relax. There's a Japanese tea house that had some intricate origami models. We saw the koi, a family of ducks and a crane (I believe that's what it was). The garden is free and you pay $2 per hour at metered parking on the CSULB campus. The Japanese Garden is a close place to get away from it all.",Anissa D
50,A Peaceful Stroll,"The garden is small beautiful delight. It is a great place to just sit and reflect on how great life can be. It is free, and open every day to the public except I believe Sunday and Monday when it is reserved for private occasions. The Koi and the visiting blue heron are fun. A food dispenser is available for the Koi. It is a fun place for small children since they love to feed the Koi. If you want complete peace and quite visit the garden during times when children are in school. The garden hosts several nice exhibits each year such as orchid and origami shows.",murjoe
50,Excellent family spot,"The Miller Japanese Garden is located on the campus of CSULB, but you feel like you are miles away from the city. Although this is a smaller Japanese garden, it is has all of the main elements of traditional garden. Bring change for the dispenser to feed the koi, and don't be surprised if a giant heron flies in looking for a meal. This is also a great spot to take photos!!",LisaGeeBee
30,Zen,"This is a small, beautiful attraction. Recommended particularly for those enthusiastic about photography. Free admission and $2 to park for one hour, however, you won't need a full hour. If you are on the campus anyways, consider walking over to look at the outside of the Mike and Arlene Walter Pyramid as well. This is a sport's stadium but architecturally, one of the few mathematically true pyramids in the US! This could be a ""two for one deal"" in terms of sight-seeing.",wiskyjax
50,A Little Bit of Heaven,"You would never know it was there, if you weren't looking for it. Tucked in to a little corner of CSULB is a most beautiful Japanese garden with curved foot bridges, beautiful trees and flowers, and a pond full of Koi. I love purchasing the pellets to feed the Koi every time I am there. This is a place you can go to sit quietly and experience peace and beauty!",ryanroost
30,Small but very nice.,"If you don't park on the street you will have to park in the lot at Long Beach State College. Day parking is $5.00 but there are a few parking meters near the garden, for $2.00 you can get an hour of parking which is way more than we needed, I don't think we spent more than a half hour in the Japanese Garden. The garden has a nice small lake with lots of fish. The garden is a very nice and a relaxing place to walk around.",Gene G
40,Beautiful Small Garden,"We very much enjoyed this small garden. It is very well kept, they have put a lot in a small space and it doesn't seem at all over crowded. As stated before pay to park only a $1 and then the garden is free. Well worth it! They was some kind of special event going on and so they were a few areas we would rudely told we couldn't go into. This is very disappointing for such a small space and we could see all of it. Some signs might have been nice alerting us to the fact they did have a special events going. The place was not crowded at all, so we saw no reason for the staff to so rudely forbid us from going into parts of the garden. We however did very much enjoy our visit here and will return again when in the area.",Karla M
40,Small but beautiful,It is a quick trip back to nature in this small garden very close to the Long Beach campus. I have visited a number of times but love spring best. Only draw back is finding parking if college is in session. Minimal entry fee.,101NDTraveler2013

50,Very relaxing,"The gardens main feature are the Koi ponds, and the practice of feeding the fish. The gardens were smaller than expected, but very nice to visit. Parking can be a problem, as the few metered spaces are not well marked. There is additional parking available in the lot with the purchase of a day ticket.",Retired801

50,Loved the giant koi fish.,"Very quaint and well maintained gardens. High light was feeding the koi fish and ducks. They were hungry! We went on a Saturday when they are normally closed. So make sure you check hours before going. Gardens are on the CSU Long Beach campus. Also, it only takes about 20-30 minutes to walk thru the gardens at a snails pace.",kdl721

50,"Beautiful small Japanese garden, good for a wedding.",I live in Long Beach and was curious one day about this wonderful garden on the campus on Cal State University Long Beach. We parked on the street and walked in. The gardens are quite nice with beautiful japanese trees and a very pretty pond. This is the destination for many weddings. My daughter has even played in a musical quartet at a wedding that was held. She thought it was a very nice place to celebrate a small wedding with a reception area adjacent to the garden.,nativecalifornian
40,Hidden secret,"This lovely garden is tucked into the California State University, Long Beach. Our three generations went on a hot summer day and immediately felt cooled by the shade and the water. The garden is small but filled with interesting plants and stone artwork. The carp are accustomed to people and come to the water's edge. This is a great place to enjoy Japanese gardening and find a little peace in the world.",siddog
50,a taste of beauty in the city,"This is a lovely place to visit with family and friends - or just for a quiet, solitary, meditative walk. It's especially great for young children who love to feed the koi. And the special events are usually lovely and enlightening.",judyross1000

50,BEAUTIFUL OASIS,love coming to this garden right in the heart of my home town! attended several weddings here here....not the greatest set up for the guests who can't even see the bride walking down the pathway as you sit across the pond on the zigzag bridge and look across and can't even admire the brides gorgeous gown but great for picture taking and photos! Love taking our children here when we visit to feed the koi fishes and explore the garden!,mivntxhais

It's beautiful with gardens, ponds and multi-colored koi that come right up to the water's surface.

50,Beautiful Garden and Oasis,"Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden is a lovely oasis in the middle of a busy city. Located on the CSULB Campus, once you step on the grounds, you are transported to another place and time.

50,Small but lovely,"Worth a half-hour visit, very peaceful and lovely. Parking can be difficult, need quarters for the meters.",BostonHistorybuff
40,"Quick, free, soothing attraction","My husband, 9-year old daughter and I went to this garden while we were in Long Beach this summer. My daughter enjoyed taking pictures there. It is a very beautiful and peaceful environment. It's small, so doesn't take a long time to see, but if you have time to linger it is relaxing and a great location for taking pictures. We had a little trouble finding the exact spot to park, but ultimately just picked a metered spot that was very close to the gardens. Also, did I mention it's free? It is a great ""downtime"" spot if you are doing lots of touring with kids - it gets you out and about, but without a lot of overstimulation. The garden is located on the site of UCLB, which is really a lovely little campus. It is definitely worth seeing if you like this sort of thing and are in the areas.",Dana S

50,Not where you'd expect to find tranquility!,"Hard to imagine this garden has been in my 'backyard' for over thirty years and it's taken me this long to see it! Always knew it was there, but never took the short drive to stroll through this tranquil garden. Had it not been for the demo on pruning black pines, who knows when? Like myself, you'd be tempted to pinch yourself thinking you are somewhere in Japan! From the traditional curved bridge, to the peaceful koi, to the neatly manicured trees, everything comes together like a picture postcard. Tips: no food or drinks, restroom available, check visiting days/hours and take a camera....it's all right there on the edge of The Beach!",Shimadog
50,A place to relax....,Looking for something local to visit. Loved the pond with all the fish. Grandson loved feeding them but just wasn't able to muster the courage to hand feed them.

40,Beautiful garden,"I was there for a wedding (September 2010), and it was great. The garden grounds were very well maintained and stunningly beautiful. The koi in the pond were nice to look at, and the whole ambiance was perfect for the wedding. As with most things Japanese, paying attention to detail is of utmost importance, and Earl B. Miller Japanese Garden is true to that sentiment.Due to the layout of the gardens, guest seating during the ceremony was less than ideal. You'll either be sitting off to the side of the couple getting married on the bridge, or across the pond. During the reception, our tables were scattered around the pond, which was nice to look at, but made socializing difficult.I would highly recommend checking it out, if you enjoy the tranquility and beauty of Japanese gardens. It would make for a great date, just walking around the pond, and the CSU Long Beach area.",Suphaas
50,Photos of the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden,On 10/23/09 I visited the beautiful Earl Burns Miller Garden when it opened at 8 am. I spent over an hour walking around and taking photos. I was like a kid in a candy store because there are so many photo ops. My only regret is that it is that it closes at 3:30 pm so I couldn't take photos in the light of the setting sun. Parking is available directly across the entrance. Click the following link to see photos:http://www.panoramio.com/user/1207066,nebula9
50,Amazingly Beautiful Japanese Garden in Long Beach,"I just attended a wedding at this pristine example of Japanese horticulture and amazing Koi Pond on the campus of California State University Long Beach. The kids truly delighted in the bright colors of the Koi fish, which we were able to feed and swim at all different speeds. The Garden even has a tea house which throughout the year is used (Seasonally) for tea ceremonies and displays depending on the current season. A great feature of the Garden is the Zen rock garden. The gravel is raked to symbolize ocean waves; the bonsai -- the forest and the boulders -- mountains. Nice to sit and meditate in front of this serence display. We were so impressed that we became ""Friends of the Garden,"" and joined with membership to enjoy the year round benefits that being a member offers. Treat yourself and your family to an enjoyable afternoon. Do call ahead as the Garden is popular and has defined hours as well as days unavailable during the week.",samsen
