40,Nice courtyard to sit,"This is a large courtyard in a development on Beverly Drive with some nice plants and a lot of tables, some with shade. Good place to have a rest.",mrdom
50,Wonderful place to relax,"Beverly Cannon Gardens. These greens are magic! Situated in the prime spots of Beverly Hills, the lawn surrounded by many restaurants and cafes. It’s beautifully lit at night too. Great place to meet people. In the summer they show movies in the garden. It’s ok to picnic there. There are tables and chairs for you to sit and enjoy your own food. Montage hotel offers other dining options. Two parking garages right under Gardens with 2 h free or $5 after 6 pm. Love this place . Highly recommend. Enjoy",Jana D
50,From George Vreeland Hill,"A small, but nice park located between Beverly Drive and Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.With great restaurants on both sides and stores up and down both streets, this park is a great place to relax and take a break from what you are doing or where you are going.It is near many of the Beverly Hills attractions and Rodeo Drive is a block away.A must-see during the holidays and the park is home to a free summer concert series.I love it.George Vreeland Hill",George Vreeland Hill

40,Cute little place,"Its a cute little place with lots of green and fountain. Not too big. I wouldn't call it gardens, but for Beverly Hills, where park are quite small, this is a garden in the middle of city, where you can eat at the outdoor restaurant or indoor and see a nice free concert every Thursday in summer. I like to come here for the concerts from time to time as I live 5 min from it.",romanka2017
50,Beautiful Gardens in the middle of Beverly Hills,"I love these gardens because it is an Oasis in the middle of Bevelry Hills. Great restaurants, hotels, coffee shops and not to mention 2 hour free parking.",Catherine B
40,Beautiful spot,"Nestled off Rodeo drive, this is surrounded by cafes and is great little spot to sit and while away some time. Kids play, dogs arent encouraged so as to keep it clean. Safe, monitored and in a nice part of town, grab a sandwich, salad, coffee and go hang out",RichardUpshall
50,Great picnic spot in the heart of Beverly Hills,"Situated next to the Montage Hotel with restaurants and cafes on either side. Open tables to sit at and really the only spot to bring your own food and eat in Beverly Hills. In the Summer there are free events on Thursdays with live music. Popular at lunchtime with local workers grabbing a bite, but scenic enough to unwind and relax if traveling as well. For travelers on a budget - go to Whole Foods 1 block away on Crescent and grab picnic food and then walk over and enjoy...",Adam A
