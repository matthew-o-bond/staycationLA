50,Good Variety,"A terrific selection of Impressionists, SE Asia (Hindu, Buddhist), and many others. So easy to get around and see what you want to see. A beautiful garden in the back. A must visit.",LarryG
50,Beautiful space and beautiful art,"Basement floor Asian devotional art, great collection of European art upstairs. 3 Van Goghs, including the Mulberry Tree. Nice JJ Rousseau and Diego Rivera. Beautiful gardens and nice outdoor cafe setting too (sandwiches mostly). Building is STUNNING, beautifully lit by circular skylights, and peaceful. Skip the glorifying Norton Simon half hour video. I found it a waste of time. It's mostly about him rather than going into any depth about the history of the art he acquired. It's glacially slow paced, and skips over some of the less pleasant details about him. He became intensely art-acquisitive starting at the age of 40 after concentrating nonstop on building an enormous fortune by taking over failing businesses, including Hunt. But the movie doesn't give you much sense of his soul.",KATYBTRAVELLER
50,A must see.... again and again!,"An amazing rotation of featured artists are among the beautiful halls of the museum. The greats.... PIcasso, Renoir, Monet, etc. Museum membership offers perks. Check out their website. After enjoying the museum, don't for get to visit the water feature and relaxing patio.",joniacafe
50,A Bit of Culture that's not on the West Side,excellent collection of European art and a Wonderful collection of Asian art as well. Make sure you visit the gardens. It's a treat especially when its lit up at night with a surreal feeling. It's free to visit on Art Nights that the City of Pasadena has every quarter.,chrisinpasadena

50,Pasadena’s finest,"Wifey and I spent a beautiful afternoon at The Norton Simon Museum, sometimes recognized as the background of The Rose Parade.It features an excellent collection of paintings and features an outdoor sculpture garden.This is a must stop for anyone in the Pasadena area.",Fzubrin
10,Thanks for nothing.,"I don’t even want to give one star because the woman I spoke to over the phone in the Membership Dept (after wasting 15 minutes trying to figure out how to actually speak to a human during business hours), was so completely rude that I decided this place, regardless of how good the art collection may be, does not deserve my patronage. We were planning to drive 90 minutes from Redondo Beach on a Saturday morning and after speaking with this ill-mannered representative from the museum, decided to scratch it off our to do list. Why would I want to visit a museum that has no interest in assisting their visitors whatsoever.",Sally M
50,Perfectly sized collection,"I last visited the Norton Simon 23 years ago, far too long an interval really because it warrants more frequent visitation. The collection and displays are the perfect size and it is possible to inspect the paintings closely without censure. The two tiny Boudins from the Cary Grant collection are charming and tiny and reflect one end of the scale contrasted with large and fascinating works by Braque and Picasso. Good sculptures, especially those by Moore and Hepworth, are a delight and the outdoor sculpture garden adds a fabulous dimension to what is a very good gallery. The cafe is small but adequate and the bookshop is a really excellent addition.",John P
50,A Pasadena Gem,"What a wonderful museum! Spent most of a day at this museum. The day we went was very low key so we were able to get up close to really study the works of art. For a peaceful break, be sure to visit the outdoor garden and sit by the lovely pond to enjoy the contemporary sculptures that grace the landscape. Don't miss the theater which shows a short film about Norton Simon's life and how he amassed his private collection. A must see when in Pasadena.",LanaD164
50,Exquisite Collection,This museum is a true jewel and should not be missed. The collection of 20th-Century art is amazing and includes several important Van Goghs and Degas. Beautiful gardens as well with amazing sculptures.,olivia k
50,"An absolute ""must-see"" for visitors to Los Angeles - even if you're not an art aficionado","Los Angeles has several outstanding art museums, and probably countless private collections, but the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena is a superb gallery, arguably better than some of the biggies like Getty. Acquired by a fabulously wealthy entrepreneur who didn't realize until mid-life that he was an art lover, this collection includes some of the most famous works in the world from artists like Raphael, Monet, Degas and Rodin (and many, many more big names in the art world). Even for those of us who don't pretend to be experts, the Norton Simon is an inspiring and beautiful place to visit.Perhaps the most appealing feature is the museum's modest size and the fact that its truly precious works are displayed (literally) within reach of every visitor. It's possible to step close to each work to examine the details of brush strokes or sculpture techniques, and most sculptures are mounted to allow visitors to see them from every angle. The collection includes some of Rodin's original bronze castings. Some of the most famous are located in the entrance garden, accessible even to those who have not paid the museum's modest admission fee ($15; free for children, students and military).I recommend the audio tour (just $3), perhaps especially if you're not an expert. Each audio description is replete with excellent production details such as appropriate music, quotes and anecdotes from and about the artists and their contemporaries, and rich details about the works themselves. The audio brings to life the works you see before you.The museum features an introductory movie about Norton Simon himself, exceptionally well produced and well worth watching before you explore his collections. The collection includes mostly European works - with an extensive section of the Dutch Masters' works, but also includes a large Asian (mostly Indian) collection, as well as a ""modern"" and ""contemporary"" collection from the 20th century.Although we expected to devote a couple of hours to the museum, we gladly spent an entire day, so engaged were we by its variety and richness. The admission charge allows visitors to leave and re-enter on the same day, merely by waving your receipt (same with the audio tour, by the way). There's a small cafe, with a limited menu, picturesquely overlooking the outdoor sculpture garden and pond... a serene place for a break.Parking is free at the Norton Simon, but maybe inadequate on a very busy weekend or holiday. But the museum really is within walking distance of much of Pasadena's Colorado Avenue shopping and dining and convention district.Don't miss this gem!",Projournalist
50,lovely small art gallery,"I ilve in Pasadena so am blessed with being able to go to the Norton simon easily. it's a great place - for a small gallery it actually has a lot of art. the exhibitions are usually pretty good - about 2 main changes a year. The gardens are small but lovely. Cafeteria food is limited but pleasant. I wouldn't write an opera about the coffee....Art book shop is very nice too. If you become a member there are lots of interesting lectures, films and parties to join where we have made new friends.",446anjums
50,A MUST for art lovers.,"Norton Simon Museum is not big, but has precious collection of paintings and sculptures from every period of time, every master artist. I was totally overwhelmed!There are Raphael (beautiful “Madonna and child”), Bellini, Tiepolo, Goya, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Picasso, Renoir, Van Gogh, Degas, Henry Moore......After a trip to India, Mr. Simon started to collect buddha statues. There is also great collection of buddha statues downstairs.This is a perfect museum for a full day visit.Nice cafe by the sculpture garden and beautiful pond.",Frances Q
50,Fabulous Collection,A small art museum housing important artists. Worth visiting again and again. Small parking lot so arrive early on a busy tourist day.,Mary B
40,Love this museum!!,"We have been several times, love the permanent collection and the temporary exhibits. Yet, each time we have visited, it just so happens that it was not long after a rain, which means that the sculpture garden is off limits. I would recommend the museum invest in a paved walkway, so it'd be possible to actually walk thru the garden instead of having to just see a portion of the sculptures from afar.There is also a very nice outdoor cafe; very nice for lunch.",BK122
50,Impressive!,"Last full day in LA, we visited the museum and strolled around the gardens. I was enthralled. The spaciousness and extent of the museum was impressive. I only wish I had discovered it earlier. Loved it all -the collections, the gift shop and the outdoor sculptres. Our littlest vistor loved the pond and the ducks..",mary734
50,All Those Great Reviews Are Spot On,"Not too big, not too small. Filled with art you've seen in art history books (a Rembrandt here, Picasso there, Degas everywhere!) and some that's totally unexpected. A ground floor filled with extraordinary stone and brass work from India, China, and surrounding areas. All beautifully displayed. And lovely grounds. This place is a real gem (and a great place to bring someone in a wheelchair or, as my mother, someone who uses a walker and borrows a wheelchair at the museum). We expected to be there for an hour or so and ended up meandering for three.",kleic
50,Always Wonderful,"Always a wonderful visit. The museum is manageable and not too overwhelming. Always a small treasure to discover in every room. Its collection is definitely better than the Getty Museum's, but just my opinion. Spend a lovely afternoon and enjoy!",ccdid10

50,More Europeans visit than do Americans (they’re used to good art),"You have to travel all the way to Pasadena to see Rembrandt’s Portrait of a Boy. Which Europeans routinely do. Some of the best Picassos anywhere are here. Ditto Degas. Superb sculpture garden.Easy to underestimate if you’ve never been, but Norton Simon has better art than most of the west side, for example the Broad.And unlike the Getty, with its stupendous space and second-rate collection, this one is all cream. The art, the gardens, the building. All of it.Some billionaires just got it. Norton Simon was a real collector from another time, without advisors and other lackeys. It shows.Awesome, brutalist building.Unhurried. Lovely. Just go.",Cat.
50,Belle Epoque Paris amongst the many highlights,"An extensive collection of the finest art provided for an enjoyable couple of hours perusal. Beginning with the great Rodin Sculptures in the garden, which included The Thinker and the complex Burghers of Calais, the latter with an engrossing back-story.Numerous works by Rubens and Flemish masters are to be seen. Van Gogh is well represented with Winter, Portrait of a Peasant and the lovely Mulberry Tree. Picasso pieces include Woman with the Mandolin and Woman with a Book.Belle Epoque Paris has enchanting examples, by Degas, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, amongst others.",permia

There's enough here, and enough quality, that you need to go slowly and absorb.

I'll be back at a more leisurely pace.",scott r
50,The BEST art museum in Pasadena,"A great selection of paintings by many of the masters. Large group of impressionists.Not many sculptures, but nice selection of Rodin.

The ever changing exhibits make coming here wonderful. I’d absolutely recommend stopping in at least once a month.,MarketingDiva
40,A Favorite,"The Norton Simon museum is a favorite destination in the city, housing some true favorite, important permanent pieces along with temporary exhibitions. That is expected, right? The best thing about the NS is its accessibility. An art museum should be part of the community. It shouldn't be a destination that needs excessive planning and then hours and hours of walking once a year. Have an hour? Drive on over, park in the lot and visit some favorite pieces of art. Walk in the garden, gaze at some sculpture, have a cold drink. Then get on with your day. Museums like this allow us to weave our love of art into every day life. If you want to stay longer, no problem he museum's collections are very manageable. If you live nearby, become a member.",Denise A
50,Great impressionist art!,"Norton Simon Musuem is a must-see if you are a fan of impressionism! They have a great collection of Renoir, Manet and sculptures from Degas.

50,Always the highlight of a trip to Pasadena,"The Norton Simon is one of my favorite museums. The selection of art offered for view is very good.

40,Wish the Cafe was better!,"When we stop in Pasadena on our way north, or on our way home, we always make a point of getting together with dear friends, who live in Southern California. Among the dearest, are friends who live in Redondo Beach, and who drive up to meet us for lunch at the Norton Simon Museum Garden Cafe.So, again, yesterday (5/9), we made plans to meet at noon, when the Museum opens. It was a dismal day, cold, overcast, and dreary. All seating is outside, in a most gorgeous setting. We spoke to a security guard, who was wearing a wool scarf around his neck. He told us that the Cafe had heaters, so not to worry. Once inside, we found out that those heaters were put into storage about one month ago, as they were no longer needed. Well, they were certainly needed yesterday!But, we were here, and would make the best of it. Settled ourselves at a table by the pond, and hoped that it would warm up. It didn’t, but hot soup, red wine, and hot coffee helped somewhat. We, also, all had grilled cheese sandwiches. The food seemed to be a notch below our previous lunches here, and that delicious Lemon Meringue pie has been discontinued. Total cost for our four lunches came to almost $100. (Wine was $10 per glass.)We love Museum Cafes. Everything always seems classy and upscale. Here, the soup came in cardboard containers (like those used for take out food), the wine came in plastic glasses, and the sandwiches looked so bland on the plastic plates, as there was no garnish at all. At the least, a sprig of parsley could have been added. We’ve been to Museums, which don’t have millions of dollars of art, and yet, have lovely Cafes, with table service, real dishes and utensils, and a lovely presentation of delicious food.We were the only ones having lunch there, but later saw some individuals sipping coffee and eating a pastry. You do not need to pay Admission to the Museum to visit the Cafe or the Gift Shop. The parking lot is roomy, and has nice wide spaces.",NYU62

50,Great museum! Don't skip this ...,"While the museum is not very large, the quality of art is spectacular. I was there on a Saturday evening (when the museum is open late). The museum was not busy at all, and the sculpture garden at sunset was serene. I was traveling with my family, but had gone to the museum on my own since my kids don't always enjoy museums. However, after visiting, I found that the museum's modest size, and the outdoor garden, would have been quite suitable for easily-bored kids.",glumpk
40,Nice art gallery,"This s a local art galley which includes some very nice works. It is a pleasant way to spend a few hours. You may have seen it during the annual Rose Parade, as the parade passes right by it. There is a fee for admission, but parking is free.",Travel92253
40,"An Enjoyable Afternoon. Morning Too, I'm Sure.","The Norton Simon is a lovely Sunday afternoon outing. The grounds are neat and landscaped nicely. The museum is a nice size. Not too overwhelming and very doable time wise. There is a great sampling of artists such as Monet, van Gogh, Klee, Kandinsky, Degas and Renoir to name a few. The galleries are spacious and well laid out.One thing that doesn't sit well with me is the staff. The front ticket staff were pleasant enough but the rest of the staff we encountered throughout our visit were gruff and crusty. With the exception of the kind and customer oriented male and female team working in the cafe. I'm sure the staff working inside the museum encounter all kinds of crazy people on their shifts that they have to deal with and this has left them less than gracious. However, a daily attitude reboot for all staff working on the floor needs to be set in place.The outdoor cafe is small but has some tasty food options and a variety of beverages. There are tables and chairs, with some under umbrellas, next to the lily pond. It's a nice setting to sit for a moment over a light bite or an iced tea and sweet treat. No food or drink allowed inside the museum. Must finish before reentering.The sculpture garden around the the lily pond is a relaxing, little stroll. There are a few benches to sit and enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.Their gift shop has some wonderful art books and lovely gift items. It's worth stopping in.If you're visiting LA and art is something you love, I recommend a jaunt to Pasadena to check out the Norton Simon. There are other things to do in Pasadena. You could make a day of it if you choose.",Tamara H
40,Urban Sanctuary,"Come here when you need a break from the fray of the day. The collection is a rather broad smattering of art from different time periods and cultures which are mercifully allocated to separate parts of the museum making it easy to go directly to which ever area is of particular interest to you. The early 20th Century European work is noteworthy.There are fine pieces by Degas, Van Gogh, Vuillard, Modigliani & The Blue Four as well as lovely small and large sculptures.There are pieces by Henry Moore inside and in the sculpture garden around the pond in the back. It's a lovely spot to sit with a cup of tea or glass of wine and take a time-out from the universe.",Judith V

50,It is now on my list of favorite art museums,"A wonderful gem and a marvelous experience in Pasadena. My wife and I viewed the two current exhibitions: Titian's 'Portrait of a Lady in White' and 'Once Upon a Tapestry: Woven Tales of Dido and Helen' and were so overwhelmed by the depth of them that we were unable to look at anything else in the collection. Simply overwhelming. We both recommend the 30-minute film on Norton Simon which provides an intimate look at the man behind the collection. Not a lot of biographical detail but it provided a in-depth look at what Simon was trying to acomplish - collecting beauty. The film presented the story behind his purchase of Rembrandt's 'Portrait of a Boy' and upon leaving the theater we asked where the painting was hung and stared at it for 10 minutes. Each painting has a brilliant description of the work / artist beside it, something I don't recall ever really seeing in a museum. I felt you did not have to have an audio guide with you, but of course they were available. We have family in Pasadena that we visit annually and I will return to view the permanent collection.

50,Excellent Stop,We were headed to another event and had a few hours so we checked out the Norton Simon Museum. It was very impressive. Well designed. The collection is beautiful but it doesn't take long to view most of the exhibits (if you don't read every sign!) You can get an audio player for $3 which we recommend. Be sure to check out the 30 minute movie which is very helpful in understanding how the collection started. Hours are limited so check the website first.,JanT56737

The Asian collection is large and well displayed in this week laid out museum. For anyone instated in Asian artifacts this is a must.",CossyWombat
50,Small and very oddly diverse and rich collection. And awesome place to come and relax.,"There are basically two floors with two collections that couldn't be more different.On the main floor is a small but extraordinarily high quality collection of European Impressionist and early Abstract masters.On the bottom floor, it is one of the finest small collections of Hindu art from the Indian sub-continent and then from north of the Himalayas all the way to China and Southeast Asia.And then there is the terrace, with it's koi pond with turtles and bamboo and peace and quiet and beauty.Just another reason to love and be amazed at little old Pasadena.",Joseph S
40,Must see if you are an art connoisseur.,"An amazing collection of paintings, sculptures, indoor and outdoor art displays, and lots of security! Plan to spend 3-4 hours to see everything, a day or more if you want to read all of the placks and study the pieces. Well organized and easy to navigate, but there is a lot to see. Personally, it was overwhelming and we left before visiting every gallery. The movie is a great place to start.",Claude Y
30,Hurried out,"The art at Norton Simon is varied, the space is manageable, the parking was ample. The number of security staff outnumber the guests 10 to 1 at a minimum.We arrived after 3pm for a 5pm closing because it wasn't our first visit. We enjoyed the art and space and just as we were wrapping up our visit, the staff informed us that they were closed. It was 4:52 PM. I replied that I was well aware of the time and the closing time. At 4:55, surrounded by a horde of security anxious to leave for the day, we were informed that they are usually gone by 8. I asked 8 til? She said no, I said 8pm? She became flustered and unable to explain what 8 meant, which allowed us the chance to realize we had been literally surrounded by security.I have been to many museums in the world and have never experienced such a squeeze by the security staff, particularly given that it was not yet 5pm. Left a really bad taste in my mouth and will not make a point to return. There had to be 20 + guards at the center and main entrance lobby, and we seemed to be the only guests holding them up from leaving. Uncomfortable.",MacCracken

50,One of the Best Small Museums in Southern California,"I love going to the Norton Simon. Just strolling up to the building puts my mind at ease and my eyes prepared for the delights ahead. Which are many...A wonderful selection of early contemporary and late 20th century paintings, including the wonderful Degas ballerinas that have their own room downstairs. These are my favorite areas. The rest of the museum is filled with beautifully displayed Medieval and European art of the finest quality and a very fine collection of Asian Art.

50,Best LA art museum East of the 110 Fwy!,"People who visit LA often look for the big ticket items, such as Disneyland or LACMA or the Getty, all great of course. However, if you are interested in fine art, and by that I mean Cezanne or Renoir, without the lines or fees, in a charming setting this is the place. I've lived in LA for 30 years and I'm still amazed at how many of my fellow Angelenos are unaware of this gem. The permanent exhibit includes works by Degas, Rembrandt, Picasso, Cezanne, Goya, Monet, and Renoir, among many others. They have a lovely cafe in a beautiful outdoor setting. If you've never made the trip to Pasadena, you owe it to yourself.",BruinontheGo
50,Nice surprise,"I had not even heard of this museum, and I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted on the lawn by Balzac and the Burghers of Calais, famous sculptures by Rodin.The delight continued inside with a plethora of Impressionists: Renoir, Degas, Monet and much more. The garden gave a distinct zen atmosphere with its pond and water lilies, dotted with statues by Henry Moore and Maillol.I left feeling replete with culture and almost as if I had taken a trip to Paris.",leprof2015
50,Right off the 210.,"Right off the 210, and a few blocks north of Old Town Pasadena sits an Art Museum that exudes class. The exterior is subdued, but not plain, the entryway was lined with statues by Rodin. Once you get your ticket the tough choices begin, straight ahead there's a garden, cafe, walk that's filled with nature, sunlight and style, turn right art wing , turn left art wing. Suffice it to say the list of artist names are impressive,Monet,quite a few Van Gogh's etc. I'm not a sophisticated art critic, I like what I like and have never seen before, more than the name of who did it.

50,A treasure and well worth the visit,Start with the film on Norton Simon and how he came to collect such wonderful art. The collection is divided between Asian and European. The European ranges from early religious art to contemporary and a tremendous sculpture collection with several Moores and Rodins. The descriptions are particularly good . My only complaint would be the cafe which although in a beautiful setting had a pretty sad menu in an era when most museums have wonderful menus,EndlessVoyage

40,"Nice, if not a little snooty","Tons of masterpieces to be seen in this little gem of a museum. I was glad we got to see a film about Norton Simon before touring the museum. I was just awestruck at the scope of art in this relatively small museum. There is a receiving line of Rodin sculptures to greet you upon entering. We should have budgeted more time and taken the audio tour.However, ""security"" was very tight. As per usual, no water bottles were permitted to be displayed and small backpack type purses needed to be slung over one shoulder (instead of being worn as a backpack purse). As I waited for my husband on a bench I took one of my feet out of my Birkenstock slip on sandal to cross my legs. I was offended when a security guard walked over and reprimanded me and told me I could not be ""bare foot"" in the musuem. Sheesh!",sazoram

50,An excellent experience,"I had heard about this museum for a long time and I am glad I finally got to see it. The museum has impressive collections of European painting and Asian sculpture and bronzes housed in a very nice building. There are plenty of paintings by the masters—Rembrandt, Van Gogh, etc. There is a sculpture garden. The 30 minute introductory movie is well worth the time. It explains much about Norton Simon and his discovery of and passion for art. The museum is open 12-5; leave yourself enough time to fully enjoy this treasure.",Wardnick1

50,What Took Me So Long?,"Cannot believe I've lived here all my life and just yesterday took time to visit the Norton Simon Museum. It was a luxurious experience! I enjoyed it so much that I actually turned in my receipt and exchanged it with another few dollars for a Membership! Can't wait to go back . There are so many very notable artists and famous paintings that I thought were around the country or somewhere else! There is also a lovely garden with a Water Lily pond that is not only beautiful but relaxing to just sit and ""take in"". The gift shop isn't the best, I've seen many others with lots of goodies that are nice additions to the home, but this one isn't quite there. The food stand is catered by Patina that also is the food source for the Hollywood Bowl and other major attractions and is ""dependable"" for a snack. Most of all, the artwork and the grounds of the museum are so very worth the visit.I did notice that a few people commented on the security making sure people don't get too close to the art. Honestly, not one person followed me around, or ""watched"" me. It was 100% the same as it is in any and all museums. No one is suppose to touch the paintings - that's a given. If you are so close that your breathing on them, something is obviously wrong. It was a perfectly wonderful experience and I hope to go back very, very soon!!! Oh...by the way, their membership sounds wonderful. They even have art classes online!! Can't wait to find out more.",judysinger
50,A great museum,"Nothing but excellent things to say about this museum. The outdoor sculpture garden with pool is the best! They have one of the best South Eastern Asia sculpture exhibits anywhere. Many world class pieces of art from the 12th to 20th centuries ,and the visiter can get very close to the art and see how it was created.The organization of the museum is very well laid out and the museum store has many wonderful things to buy from various cultures.The price for the museum is really great ,as well as the parking, and they have a very nice little coffee shop that overlooks the pool in the sculpture garden. What's really nice is how inexpensive it is to go to the museum, and see world class art in a beautiful setting.Nothing but great things to say about the experience there, the staff, the whole experience.",mariusdelister

Giant Steps by Coltrane and Pinocchio by Wayne Shorter where quite memorable performances.",just910
50,More Masters per Square Yard Than I've Ever Seen,"This museum delighted me, my husband (not very patient with museums) and my grown son. I have never seen so many master works crammed into every gallery, and I have been to a lot of art museums. Degas, Van Gogh, Renoir, Pissarro, etc. We stayed in the 18th- through 19th-century galleries and were mesmerized. Also, the write-ups on the wall explaining each painting are engaging and easy to understand, not just artsy mumbo-jumbo. We also loved the garden behind, with the lily pond, as well as the shady entrance with several Rodin sculpures on either side. If the weather is hot, keep in mind that the museum's cafe is out in the garden and has no indoor seating. The gift shop is very nice. Everything is nicely done, not too big, and very enjoyable.",Ann D
40,Nice Med-sized Art Museum,"I am a visitor to LA and when I have an open afternoon I usually go see what's new at the Getty. This time I was heading up to Pasadena so I decided to check out Norton Simon and very glad I did. They have a nice selection of major artists including a couple of amazing Rembrandt's and a nice section of Impressionists plus a lot more including the fourth Rodin Sculpture Garden I have found (Philadelphia, Stanford and Paris being the other three). I felt they have more art on display then the Getty though I am sure the Getty owns far more. For me it was the right size and the paintings were arranged nicely by period rooms. Another reviewer mentioned you can get up close to the paintings which is true (and good for me since I forgot my glasses), but the pictures are actually covered in glass which provides some glare close up and you lose the depth effect of the brush strokes. In the end, it didn't bother me, but it might bother others. Access is easy off the highway and parking is free. Entry is $15 plus $3 for a headset if desired.",geomom01
50,Very good art gallery,This art gallery is well worth a visit. It has some excellent impressionist and post impressionist paintings in it as well as some early very good European art. It is well laid out with the paintings very well displayed.,Anne S
50,Great museum that doesn't take all day,"This is a great art museum. Often overlooked in LA area. It's not so large that it takes all day to go through it. Paintings are the best, ranging from old European masters to modern art. Beautiful gardens, too. Has a patio cafe with very limited items. Needs to add an indoor restaurant. Artists include Raphael, Rembrandt, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas, Goya, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Picasso and a host of other greats. Lots of Asian art, mostly sculptures. I wish the museum could be expanded slightly to make room for more of its collection. For example, no Andy Warhol art was displayed when I visited. It's a nice oasis on busy Colorado Avenue in Pasadena. Nice gift store.",Les G
50,Exceeds Expectations,This is a national class art museum. Impressionist collection is wonderful. Bring children and grandchildren who are interested in art.,HPH360

50,Exceptional Air Conditioning,"While the art is truly exceptional, their air conditioning on this 100+ degree day was even better. We thought the temperature was about 65 degrees, almost too cold but certainly refreshing on a hot humid day. The lay out of the museum is very nice if you are in the mood to do a chronological visit from the 1500's to the 1900's. There is a relaxing sculpture garden replete with requisite lily pond. The museum staff are friendly and helpful.",BoboTravlr

Rarely crowded, you can view true artist masterpieces as close as you need and as long as you would like. There is a great cross representation of much of the world's art.Their Friday film and dance series in the intimate theater is another hidden highlight.

40,"Nice, But Rather Small","Having been to many amazing museums in the world, with free entry, the $15.00 admission price felt a little high for what you get. You are constantly supervised with museum staff watching your each and ever move. This felt a little restrictive. There is a nice pond in the back, a museum store and refreshments.

50,Excellent audioguide for a visit,"Enjoyed my first visit to the Norton Simon today. It was helpful to arrive right at noon: ample parking and uncrowded. Renting the audioguide for the permanent exhibits was worthwhile. Not only were the explanations interesting and varied (and fun to listen to some of.the info for children), but the classical music selections at the start of the audio were pleasurable. The audio also seemed to mute the echo of other visitors' comments. The written explanations on the walls were different from the audio.

I recommend this place to locals and visitors who have extra time to visit the quintessential Pasadena. Come, be cozy and bring a book.",Ashley S
50,An uplifting art experience,"A visit here is a very pleasnt way to while away a few hours as you view the many Rodin sculptures and the Dutch and other European classic paintings. There is a large garden at the rear of the museum that provides a a calming and serene environment. There is also a snack bar where you can indulge in some coffee,sweets and light lunch offerings as you enjoy the landscape as you sit and converse outdoors. A very positive experience to convey to your out of town visitors.",tennisman2016
50,Wonderful,"We were in California to visit the Getty Center (and really enjoyed it) and only came across the Norton Simon Museum as we passed it when visiting the Gamble House so checked it out with Google and decided to delay our trip on to San Francisco so we could visit the Norton Simon Museum and what a great decision that turned out to be, it is nothing like the large art galleries around the world but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality.

The museum is never crowded; you will often be alone in the galleries. At $15., the entrance fee is very reasonable. Downstairs you will find one of the most extensive collections of Southeast Asian sculptures; room after room of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain sculptures, many of them masterpieces. There is a lovely outdoor sculpture garden on this level. On the main floor, which is divided into two separate galleries, you will find one of the most impressive personal collections of Impressionist and Post Impressionist art on the planet, and in the other gallery, a very impressive collection of 16-18th Century art, including three signed Rembrandts. Outside in the back, there is a lovely and peaceful sculpture garden, full of Henry Moore sculptures, as well as shaded Cafe, with salads and sandwiches, as well as a large selection of beers and wines, both by the glass and by the bottle, as well as a great lineup of deserts.

When I visited I also enjoyed an excellent exhibit on Degas' sculptures. I found the collections well presented, but in general found the collection a bit piecemeal. There were a few paintings of major artists, but most were early, less significant works. This was especially true of the Impressionists & post Impressionists. A strong positive though were the Rembrandts - quite rare to see in a west coast museum.

50,Small but Impressive Museum housing a variety of artwork,"A hidden gem in the heart of Pasadena. Tucked behind tall trees and lots of greenery, the building itself is impressive to approach. The walkway leading up to the front door is guarded by various sculptures along the side. The entryway is very inviting and the main lobby leads to the guest service area to purchase entry tickets as well as audio guides if you would like at an additional cost. You can explore either to the right or to the left but there is so much to look at but not overwhelming since the museum itself is not very large. The theater features a short film introducing patrons to Norton Simon - the man who had collected all these amazing artwork and his passion for collecting such beauty. There is a lower level that houses more sculptures as well as pieces from India. There is a little outdoor space with a couple sculptures as well. Back on the main level there is the museum gift shop where you can purchase mementos as souvenirs as well as books or postcards or even educational items for children. The doors opposite the main entry across the lobby leads to the sculpture garden. There is a small cafe available with light snacks and beverages. A walkway meanders throughout the outdoor area with more sculptures available for viewing as well. There are some plants to enjoy but we were there in the colder season so there wasn't much more to look at. A fun little piece of art and history in Pasadena.",imskimmy

50,My Favorite LA Museum!,"I had never heard of this museum until I spotted it on TripAdvisor two weeks ago. I'm so happy I did because it ended up being my favorite museum in LA. The H shape of the museum is very manageable and easy to get around and the permanent collection is simply lovely! I really enjoyed the Degas sculpture exhibit downstairs as well. The outdoor area was closed due to the crazy rain, but I hope to spend time out there next time I'm in Pasadena. Truly exquisite!",arissalovesart
50,An exceptional gallery in Pasadena,"One of the most enjoyable galleries in North America.An open design that is inviting, has parking out front, a beautiful sculpture garden at the back, and a small coffee shop in the garden.The gallery shows art from hundreds of years and from many countries.A must for a visit.",Bruno S
50,"It doesn't get better for Memling, Rembrandt, Vigee Le Brun, Degas and Angkor sculpture","Not a large collection, but what gems! In two hours you can easily see the best of French 18th and 19th-century painting, some Italian and Dutch and Netherlandish paintings not see in the U.S otherwise. The Hans Memling Christ Giving His Blessing from 1478 is worth the trip from anywhere and then there are two Rembrandts, a superb Diego Rivera, a wonderful Vigee Le Brun portrait of Theresa, not to mention many Degas sculptures and probably the finest collection of Cambodian Angkor Period sculpture in the U.S.",Rolf A
50,"Outstanding Collection of Art, Good Value",A wonderful venue for an extensive collection of art by great painters and sculptors. Highly recommend an audio guide for only $3. The explanations cover most of the paintings and discuss techniques that set the artists apart. The Van Goghs are particularly interesting but also many other impressionists.,canuck22SanFrancisco
40,Pleasantly surprised—great museum!,"My art history teacher in San Diego recommended this museum and we are so glad we visited it on “Art Night” in Pasadena. They have an amazing collection of 14th century sculptures and great artwork, as well, including paintings by Diego Rivera, Picasso and Monet. It is a very beautiful museum.",travelingCAgal

Free parking. In the auditorium they show a film on the life of Norton Simon. The museum is two floors. Lots of Degas paintings and sculptures. Rembrandt wood-block prints (a surprise to me). A small cafe. The last two times I have gone, I have been given a free print to take home!",Andrew H
50,Gem in Pasadena,"If you come to So.California for a short visit, make a visit to this museum on the top of your list. The collection is not in quantity, but of the top quality. Go done to the lower level and you will be so impressed by the Ancient stature of Buddha sitting in the middle of a big window with a downcasting look in His tranquilPosture.. All your worldly worries will be transformed into calmness. This effect alone is worth your time and effort coming to Pasadena. Joyce Sin, San Gabriel, CA",joycesin
50,A Treasure in Pasadena,A plethora of artworks and sculptures abound in this beautiful museum with paintings by masters such as Rembrandt and Van Gogh.

50,A Wonderful Collection!,"This is my second visit to the Norton Simon and I figured I’d finally write a review for it.While I believe the Getty has better architecture, gardens, and panoramic views, I believe Norton Simon’s collection of art is just as good if not slightly better due to its greater variety of art. Whereas the Getty mostly focuses on European art from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, the Norton Simon also has that, but includes later artists like Matisse and Picasso and is even more geographically diverse with its impressive collection of Asian sculptures (mostly from India, Thailand, and Cambodia) downstairs. At the time of this review, Rembrandt’s iconic Self Portrait at Age 34 was on loan from London and was the whole reason I came today as it is the first time it’s ever been displayed in the United States. I’m so glad I got to experience this opportunity while it lasted since it was the highlight of my visit! Definitely a nice place to take in some culture for the afternoon.",Colby S
50,A true gem of a museum - stunning collection,"Worth a detour to Pasadena. One of the finest post-war private collections now in a public museum. Renaissance to 20th century and Southeast Asian art that are examples of the finest available. The museum is named after an industrialist who had the funds and the eye to select the best. Wonderful Impressionist to modern examples, not to mention outstanding examples of other periods. If you can't get to India, just go into the amazing Asian galleries.",traveledfordecades

50,Something for Everyone!,"What a gem! There is so much to see and the range of art covers so many regions and periods in history that it is a lot to take in but if you give yourself plenty of time you won't be sorry! There is also a sculpture garden outside where there is a pond, beautiful grounds! Stay for happy hour, it's a perfect setting!",LadyDiButterfli
40,Good selection of works from a range of periods,"We enjoyed this small museum. Conveniently located near old Pasadena, free onsite parking, lots of sculptures and a great selection of art. The outside garden with sculptures, pond and a little restaurant was a charming place for lunch. Food was simple but good.",HollySev
50,"Outstanding Art, Beautiful Museum","Pleasantly surprised at the range and quality of art in this Museum. Why fly to Paris and work through the Louvre with this Museum in your back yard? Well-known painters and well organized by time periods. Loved the paint colors of museum walls that seemed to accentuate the paintings. The plaques on the paintings were outstanding, easy to read and understand, as opposed to the Louvre which was often confusing. We spent an entire day and could have spent another day. Museum cafeteria disappointing. Most of the entrees were “out” by the time we got through the line and what was left was mediocre. What I loved was the lack of crowds. We were visiting in December between Christmas and New Years and had entire galleries to ourselves to immerse in the art and feelings the art evoked. Parking was easy. All in all, extremely enjoyable visit and unbelievable art. Highly recommend.",SunCitySenior

Huntington Gardens, Descano and Arlington Gardens are also wonderful Arlington is little known, but a free, 3 acre, beauitfully designed garden. NON-profit and maintained by community volunteers who must be very talented and passionate. Perhaps non-profit nature means it is not advertised so missed by tourists, but it is our favourite garden.",Jane S
50,Beautiful collection,"An extensive art collection in an impressive setting. Easy to wander through the galleries and see a history of European painting. In a smaller location it makes it easy to see it all with very impressive works from as early as the 1300’s to contemporary. Boticelli, Rembrandt, Picasso, Monet, Van Gogh just to name a few. Beautiful sculptures in the garden by Rodin and Moore. Nice cafe overlooking the pond in the garden. Larger museums may be more complete, but can also be overwhelming. This was perfect.",Dansker58

50,The Norton Simon Museum is a true gem housing so many world-renoun art treasures from many historical periods!,"I am hard-put to find a family member, friend, community member or anyone who has visited The Norton Simon Museum who does not love it! While millions of TV viewers observe the building from the outside every New Year's Day as Rose Parade floats turn the corner from Orange Grove Avenue to Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, most do not know that it is an amazing art museum housing the various collections of multi-millionaire art collector, Norton Simon; collections which span many historic periods. The museum is filled with treasures from numerous ancient statues and objects of art from Egypt and various Asian countries, to paintings of Rembrandt and Dutch Masters, to works of numbers of impressionistic artists including the Degas ballerina and female bather sculptures and paintings, to works of modern art. The outside surroundings of this museum are as beautiful and serene as those on the inside of the museum. Famous sculptors' works adorn the front entry area of the museum as well as the beautiful, quiet and serene lily pad pond and garden area at the rear of the museum. A small and lovely outdoor cafe is positioned in the lily pad pond sculpture garden area where one can not only enjoy hot and cold drinks, including wine and beer, lunch, snacks, and small bites but the beautiful natural surroundings; surroundings that provide one the feeling of being in a nature preserve oasis! While the museum does require entrance fees, my recollection is that there are child/student and senior reduced fees available. The museum offers entrance at no charge at least one day per month, and stays open late on a number of Friday evenings. It is important to check with the museum for special exhibits, entrance fee prices, days and times when there are no entrance charges each month, children's and adult's activities, classes, films, special tours and programs. I can guarantee that once you visit the Norton Simon Museum you will definitely want to make return visits!",Judith H
50,Peaceful Museum,"Wonderful gem in Pasadena! The collection has lots of great pieces (Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Picasso, etc) and it is definitely worth the ticket (15$). First Friday of every month the entrance is free after 5:00PM. Parking is free as well. The place is peaceful and the gardens around are absolutely gorgeous. I love the way the interior flows into the gardens. Highly recommend!",easillisae

50,A Hidden Gem,"I've lived here forever, but only recently visited the NS Museum. Reasonably priced and famous (you see it each year during the Rose Parade). When walking in the garden outside, one does hear the famous freeway, but it shouldn't damper your visit. Further, the cafe is quite nice and weather permitting (which is 350+ days/year), eating outside is quite enjoyable!",JDinLA
40,Impressive trove of Impressionist paintings,"Unable to visit Paris?

50,Best Museum for Impressionistic Art,"Most people know the Norton Simon Museum because for decades it has served as the backdrop for the New Year's Day Rose Parade. But next time you are in Pasadena don't just view the Rodin's from on the outside, spend half a day inside.The heart of the exhibit is the private collection of business man Norton Simon and his second wife, actress Jennifer Jones. Their personal collection is so extensive the present venue cannot display all the wonderful art. This means that the collection is constantly rotating so if you went to see a favorite Degas in June, you may find it replaced by a Monet in December. This is a good thing. There's always something new to explore.If you, like myself, are partial to the French Impressionists then you will be totally happy for they are all here! There are no big crowds and no rush. This too is a good thing.The Norton Simon also has a lovely cafe and a small garden to wander through. And while you are there you will want to check out their lecture series. So next time you are in Pasadena, do check out the Norton Simon Museum.",PapaT0ny

40,A long time fixture of Pasadena.,"I have lived in Pasadena for over 30 years and I have seen the museum go through major changes. Its still a great little museum with a good ambience.Unfortunately, for my own desires it was transformed from a Contemporary or modern art museum into a more accessible art museum. I was truly hoping that it could have maintained and built up the Contemporary art pieces as a fixture in Pasadena. Much of the modern collection disappeared slowly.Never the less a great spot for art.",TONKA2
50,Just Wonderful!,"This museum is a trifecta - the art, the setting, and the gift shop are all terrific. The gardens are lovely and a pleasant place to enjoy a cup of coffee or snack. The Degas sculptures are unmatched . The Asian art and buddha exhibit was breathtaking in its content and curation. We also loved the gift shop and bought a terrific art game for our granddaughter. The icing on the cake is that parking is free!",Kim B
50,Second visit in 25 years....I waited too long!,"Yesterday we made a trip to the Norton Simon museum, which I had last visited over 25 years ago. Then, as now, the building and the grounds are beautiful and peaceful. (Try as hard as you can to ignore the freeway sounds coming from the 210.) We had time only to visit part of the museum (19th and 20th century art) on a visit that lasted several hours. We have visited many museums all over the world and agree that the labels on the wall beside the art work provide more than the artist name and date created. They give phenomenal background and details regarding each piece, written so well and in such a way that it impressed us enough to mention it here.We visited on a Saturday, so the museum was busy with many multi-generational families--so nice to see. It seemed there were also groups of art students visiting with their instructors. The volume was louder than we would have liked, but one would expect that on the weekend.The line for lunch at the outdoor café was long, but we stayed strong and waited for a good 20-25 minutes only to find a number of food options had run out. The only criticism I have for the Norton Simon museum is to encourage the vendor to better anticipate customer numbers, especially on weekends.The outdoor garden is stunning. Take a walk on the winding path around the pond and point out all the plants, sculptures, and ducks to your children or parents. :)The cost to visit--$12 adults, $9 seniors, free for children, students and active military with ID--is generous considering the quality of work represented. While our return to the Norton Simon museum will be much sooner than the previous span in between visits, we will definitely return again to see more of this high quality ""attraction.""",Urbane415
50,A surprise every time.,"Visiting here just once or 365 times a year will reward your soul and body. There is always a new surprise in every part of the large park and museum complex. You could spend your whole visit outside roaming the famous park sections from giant cactus garden to rose garden to Camilla path. Or hit the special exhibits and permanent collections of WORLD CLASS art. Or do some of both! If you live close enough, your going to want to be a member so you can follow your favorite plants through their seasonal changes and not miss the free lectures offered after closing.",SusieHiker

The main floor is Western art, with a vast collection of Impressionists and Post Impressionists plus artists from earlier centuries, including my favorite Rembrandt.

The sculpture garden is beautiful, mostly Henry Moore's but others as well. We really enjoyed our visit.",MarinLin

There's also a free audio guide which we did not use. Outside, there's a lovely pond with a nice cafe and plenty of shaded seating. Staff in the entire museum are friendly and helpful.

50,A Small Museum with a Big Soul,"The Norton Simon Museum is a treasure hidden in Pasadena. Compared to the Getty, both of them, the Los Angeles County Museum, and most major museums, it is little. Perhaps “intimate” is a better word to describe its presence. To my mind, it has the finest art collection on the west coast, or possibly in America.It has an excellent Asian collection, and it contains extraordinary impressionist and post-impressionist paintings.Among the works I find most captivating are Rodin’s Burgers of Calais in all its august grandeur and the matter of fact and quiet eloquence of Zurbarán’s Still Life with Lemons, Oranges, and a Rose. Between these two, very different works of art, one can find a full range of human expression.",bedellgeorge

50,Lovely and easy to explore,"From pre-Renaissance to modern, this easy-to-explore museum offers a range of interesting paintings and sculptures. My favorite is the Impressionists. Lovely Degas sculptures and paintings, Cezannes, and van Goghs are easy to see and linger over.",AshleyB63

50,Great French Impressionists Collection,"If you are a fan of Degas, Monet, Manet, Renoir, etc., you will enjoy this museum's collection. Make sure to stroll through the beautiful sculpture garden and catch the 20-minute Gregory Peck-narrated movie about the life of Norton Simon and his art collection. Admission price is $48 (7/2017)",JSharpFamily
50,First Friday Free is a great promotion,Norton Simon Museum offers Free admission after 5PM the first Friday of each month. The museum offers a large impressive collection with periodic new collections.Well worth the time to visit,Mark T
50,An amazing collection of art from all corners of the world,"This was a memorable day for me in many ways; the lady that I was dating was a very astute art aficianado, and had offered to guide me through the Norton Simon, a place that I hadn't visited in years. We started in the Indo/Asian section, and I enjoyed visiting with Hindu and Buddhist Gods and Demi-Gods that I had met long ago. In the European collection, I reveled in the many works from Degas, Van Gogh, and many Dutch Masters. It's a wonderful collection, every art lover will find something to thrill them. As we left, we stopped at some of the magnificent bronze statuary in the forecourt of the museum, finding bronzes of Chaucer, Rabelais and Balzac; which inspired us to join in a chorus from ""The Music Man""! We kinda made a connection there.",DonaldYokum
50,Small and beautiful,I love this place. It's pretty small and easy to see everything it has to offer in just a couple of hours. There are quite a few famous pieces here and the sculpts in both the front and the outside garden area are fantastic. A really lovely museum and definitely worth a visit!,S Logan
50,There aren't enough stars to say how wonderful the Norton Simon Is,"The Norton Simon is one of the States top collections, and it's hard to imagine a trip to this region without stopping in. And by stopping in, I mean going with the knowledge that you'll need time to absorb the depth of the collection. There's ample free parking and a modest admission charge. For the convenience of the parking and your support of the collection, you get access to some of the finest European paintings and Asian art anywhere. Do leave yourself time to walk the wonderful garden. It's simply breathtaking at every turn.",Richard C
50,"Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful!","First time I came here was for a high school project. Ever since then, I love to visit this museum when I have a free day and need a beautiful space to relax in. Norton Simon Museum is not as huge and overwhelming as Huntington Library. You can finish the museum in a day. I really enjoy the Lily Pond.",Rowang
50,First Fridays are free!,I come here with my father in law on Friday evenings to get inspired for the weekend. First Friday of each month the museum is free and open to the public so we love wandering the outdoor sculpture garden and saying hello to the permanent collection as well as visiting shows. This is a great outing for adults and kids who enjoy art.,Katiesarahflynn
50,Free night is the best deal ever!,"The first Friday evening at 6pm, the museum is free until closing time....what an awesome gift to us to see the works of monet, manet, degas and van gogh...plus an Asian collection that will blow you away....the first Friday of each month at 6pm.....so good!",Michael G
50,A treasure trove!,"Though I live only ten minutes by car from the Norton Simon, I only recently went there for the first time with an out-of-town visitor. It's a beautiful museum indoors and out, with countless well known pieces from some of the worlds best known artists. I'm ashamed of myself for not having gone sooner, and I won't stay away too long either, now that I know what I missed all these years. It's not a small museum, nor is it so large that it exhausts you to see a mere fraction of it. I highly recommend a trip to the Norton Simon for locals and visitors alike.",k9dale
40,Great European and Asian Art,"Nice Museum - Start with the movie that goes through the history of Norton Simon who started as a business owner during the industrial age and then became an avid art collector. You can then get a perspective of the art collection. What is not well publicized is that the art that is displayed is only the tip of the iceberg. He has a collection of 11,000 pieces, so that the museum has rotating exhibits to display some of his stored works. Plan to spend 3-4 hours at the museum.",Byron G
50,My favorite place for Sunday lunch or an early evening glass of wine,"The Norton has a small but exquisite collection, especially Van Gogh's and Degas'. But the garden cafe is a true gem. Set in the sculpture garden which has a beautiful pond, the cafe us a great spot for a quiet lunch. The museum is open until 8pm on Friday. Nothing more romantic than a glass of wine as you watch the setting sun work its magic on the garden.",Charles H
50,Fantastic museum,Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the museum. Very well maintained and easy to navigate. Great time was had by all!,cagarwal2017
50,A place of art and beauty,"This is a place where art, history and geography are beckoning to take you into what beauty and aesthetics have been through ages and parts of the world.Take your time and enjoy it.As a premium you may treat yourself to a stroll in the meandering small garden around a pond of water lilies a la Monet.I may be partial to this place of which I am a member and visit to take refuge in beauty.",Boualem11
40,Great Collections,The garden area is especially beautiful and peaceful with exceptional sculptures. Inside the collections are exquisite. Taking photos without flash is allowed. Parking was very easy. I spent 3 hours enjoying the art and renewing my creative interests. So glad I went!,Luv2Trek2020
50,An unexpected treat for any lover of art,"If you go to the Norton Simon any day you are in for a treat - a number of beautifully arranged galleries with masterpieces from the 16 to 21st century, plus a very fine collection of Asian art occupying the floor below the main floor. Surrounded by a beautiful garden. Go there during the week and you will feel like you have the place to yourself. You really should go, it will do your spirit good.",John D
50,Small museum with a great collection,"We visited this museum with a teen aged granddaughter who likes impressionistic art. There is plenty of parking and admission was free for those under 18. We spent about 2 hours inside where they have a great collection of pieces from well known artists such as Van Gogh, Degas and Monet. Outside is a sculpture garden and beautiful lily pond.",CalifCar
50,Make time for a visit,The Norton Simon museum is not to be missed. Mr. Simon built an incredible collection of pieces from many different genres.,MsSassy19
50,Great museum! Outdoor cafe,"Stopped by this museum the day after seeing U2 on our way back home.Amazing unexpected art collection and nice outdoor garden with Henry Moore sculptures and a little outdoor cafe to have some lunch and wine. We didn't have a lot of time, so we did not see the Asian art downstairs.Galleries are laid out well. Very cool, worth a visit and would return.",KMcDDS1988
50,Great works of art in a small setting that makes it accessible for all,"I enjoyed walking through the halls and tracing the history of painting from the 14th to the 20th centuries. My favorites were the earlier works up to about the 17th century. Although there were security people watching at every turn, you could walk right up to the artworks and take non-flash photos. I would have loved to have had more time to read each of the descriptions. We had a little under 2 hours to look over the four wings upstairs and to view the Asian sculpture exhibit downstairs. It was quiet and cool in the museum. If it had not been such a hot day, I would have liked to roam around the sculpture garden. I highly recommend visiting this museum. My friend who lives in Pasadena had not been there and was really impressed.",MaryAD24
50,"This is one of the Top Art Museums in the world, a must see.","Ten stars if possible. Great museum with paintings and sculptures from the Great Masters. This museum houses some of the greatest artworks of mankind and is a pleasure to visit.There are also outside sculpture gardens and a pond that make the experience even more great.Do not miss the ancient Asian exhibit or the special exhibits on the lower level.Plenty of on site parking, low entry cost, and ease of freeway access makes this a perfect stop for the art enthusiast and traveler.Special thanks to the staff member that found my camera case that had dropped out of my pocket and then searched for me to return it.Super clean bathrooms, helpful people at each exhibit, and security that rivals Fort Knox make this museum a good visit.Be sure to allow two to four hours or more, and be sure to bring your camera {NON-Flash photography is allowed}.",Bill M
40,Small Museum,"This local museum highlights the history and evolution of paintings. The buidling is arranged in a large H and easy to get around.There were many early American portraits that I found unappealing as the heads were too big for the bodies and the childrens faces looked like old people. But thats the collection, not the facility.There are small outside areas, to purchase and eat food/beverages. We purchased a small split of wine ($30), price seemed excessive for a glass of wine.If I had to choose a local museum I would select the Huntington Library and Gardens instead.",Gailybird
40,"Lovely Gardens with Sculptures, great european art inside","From Cezanne to Matisse to Pisaro , this Museum has a nice assortment of Impressionist Art.Also was impressed by the Marlene Dietrich Movie about a Woman on a Train..and a reconciliation of sorts. All in all, even the geese and ducks in the Garden were welcoming and it was a Haven of Serenity amidst the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. I took the Orange Line from Union Station LA about 20 minutes.",Andre E
30,Small Art Museum,"Apparently they place great value on ultra modernism. Though, they do have a selection of other styles. Over zealous security watches every move you make. If you are short on time, there are much better museums close by and several better in the Greater Los Angles area.",Darius M
50,Excellent Private Gem,"I try to go to the Norton Simon museum at least 3 times a year. It is compact sized space, located in civilized Pasadena on the cusp of Old Town. Its collection of first rate art, impressionism, some old masters, post impressionism, modern are an eclectic mix. The gardens are lovely. It does not overwhelm in size and features great exchanges and exhibits from other museums. I would rate this as similar to The Frick in NYC.",claireesp
50,Great museum,We so enjoy visiting various museums. This one also had a little place where you could get lunch. Children could also go there on field trips.,10234
50,Truly a hidden gem!,"My title is exactly how I felt after spending several hours here with my 2 children, ages 11 and 14 and my parents. The only question I had was ""why didn't I come here sooner?"". This place is fairly small (especially when compared to the Getty or LACMA) so it doesn't feel overwhelming for you or the kids. There are some big names here such as Rembrandt, Raphael, Cezanne, Monet, Van Gogh, etc... There were several pieces of art that I recognized as being famous even if I didn't always recognize the names. The collection for the most part was arranged in chronological order, kind of interesting. They have paintings dating back to the 12th century! Adults are like $12 I think, students with ID are cheaper and I believe kids under 12 were free.The kids were pretty good about trying to learn about some of the art by reading the plaques but I wish I would have invested the $3 for each of us to have a hand held audio device you put to your ear, punch in a corresponding number for each piece of art and then learn about that piece. That would have been nice because you can jump around from piece to piece and just hear about the ones that interest you. If you have kids with you that are least 8 and up, I would highly recommend doing this, it will make it more interesting and easier for them to enjoy the art.There is a lovely garden and cafe on sight. With kids, even older ones, I'd highly recommend planning a break at the cafe for lunch. Their food was expensive but also very good. I'm sure you could also bring some food in your own bag and no one would really notice.They are extremely strict about having foods and liquids near the art! When you enter, if they see you have a water bottle, you will be asked to check it (they have a coat check-like desk). You can go back anytime during your visit and get a drink, it really wasn't a big deal. If your bag is over a certain size (like a back pack), you will need to check it (this may include large diaper bags, not sure).I would highly recommend you see the 30 min documentary about Norton Simon in their small theater. It was very well done and very interesting. They highlight certain art pieces in the exhibit (such as the ivory elephant chess set near the gift shop and the beautiful still life by Zuburan of lemons, oranges and tea cup and the picture of a child by Rembrandt.) If you try to show the kids some of the pieces highlighted in the film, they will be excited to recognize them while they watch it OR, see the film first and then make it like a scavenger hunt to find the pieces highlighted in the film. This would be fun actually! But we didn't see the film until 3:00, which was after we saw the art.Our group was there for about 4 hours and yet we only saw about half the collection and none of the special exhibits. We took almost an hour at the cafe and garden plus the film and I didn't want to exhaust the kids or get to the point where they were begging to leave.We all enjoyed it and I can't wait to return sometime to see what I missed plus I will rent the audio device next time for each person. They don't open until 12:00 and their food is very expensive, so consider eating an early lunch before you go, but definitely take a break in the garden and cafe! Enjoy...we certainly did!",applejanna
50,A Jewel in Pasadena,"I have long felt that the Norton Simon is one of the best art museums in the country - and definitely my favorite. Very tasteful, engaging exhibits. In particular, not only do I like the collection, but I appreciate the architecture and intimacy of the museum itself. Definitely worth a visit for any art lover in Pasadena.",stageguytx
50,I'm in heaven in my own backyard.,One of the best museums in the world. Easy to park and get around. Magnificent gardens to meander around with lovely statues. Highly recommend for a few hours well spent.,bbarnett12williams
50,Morning looking at paintings in the Norton Simon Museum and walking in the garden in October 2015,"I arrived before it opened and was amazed to see how large their staff number was. They all arrived on time and uniformed and I found once inside were extremely helpful. There was parking there although I was dropped off.Inside were marvelous paintings, many of which I had never seen before. Van Goghs and two gems of Boudin seaside scenes, gifted by the late Cary Grant. Other paintings by Degas, Renoir and Botticelli amongst many well known names.In the gardens are Rodin statues, they may have been genuine but I did not have time to ask before I left. They certainly looked it.The impressionist and post-impressionist styles are so well represented that I would have liked another morning there.There is a restaurant which I did not eat at, but it looked as if it offered everything a traveler would need. The lake and plants in the garden have been designed to resemble Monet's garden in France and were very attractive with irises around the banks and taller species of trees behind them.There were plenty of staff to guide one and as I left I was given a large photograph of the lake surrounded by flowering irises as a memento of my visit. This gallery is on the edge of the main streets of Pasadena and was a short taxi drive from where I stayed in that suburb. Small groups of students were being shown around but they were so quiet you could have heard a pin drop.This is definitely a place for the seriously interested art addict rather than for young children although they would enjoy the garden.",Elinor C

50,Favorite local museum,"The Norton Simon Museum is one of the best places to visit in Pasadena, if you love great art, sculpture and beautiful gardens. It is not a huge place, you can see everything within a few hours and enjoy a snack outside on the patio overlooking the pond and surrounding garden. We love to visit this museum, it is a real jewel.",jmoonmac
50,Relaxing afternoon of art,My husband and I came here with my friend who is from Idaho. We all enjoyed it very much. Tickets are $12 for adults and free for those with a student ID. They have a great collection of art from Italian Renaissance to Modern and Picasso. The sculpture garden is beautiful and relaxing. There's a small cafe in the garden where you can have lunch or drinks with friends.,Shelley F
50,Neighborhood museum,"I live nearby, so I visit often. My favorite thing is to sit in the garden and have a drink. So peaceful. The art is great. I love the Degas' as I have an affinity for dance/dancers. Wide range of art with amazing temporary exhibits coming and going. Museum store has fun and unique gifts.",Gloria A
50,Great collection and a beautiful location,A must see in Pasadena. Strong Asian sculpture collection and a terrific impressionist collection. A great way to spend an hour or so. Recommended.,Marblehead750
50,A wild-life friendly Museum,"There will be many reviews about the arts, services, events, and the garden but, my review is about an unplanned incidence that shows the HEART of the museum. I was visiting one day during the early spring of 2017 and saw a fairly good portion of the garden was fenced off including one of my favorite stone bench. Since I frequent the museum so I know this is truly unusual. But than I saw them... A proud daddy duck standing on ""my stone bench"" watching over the dedicated mommy duck sitting on her eggs about 20 feet away. Although ""my stone bench"" was covered by duck ..... droppings.... I was so touched. This is a Museum with a heart.",HappyGeekyWoman
50,Great museum in a good location.,Enjoyed the entire collection in a limited amount of time (coupleof hours). Also enjoyed the outdoor dining area and statue garden with attractive pond.,rulysses
50,Great art in fabulous setting,Gem of a museum. Love the special events: concerts and movies. The outside space makes the museum all the more delightful,robin A
50,Wonderful Way to Spend an Afternoon,Visiting the Norton Simon recently took me back into a world when the great Masterswere taking a brush to canvas. The Museum is laid out in comfortable style with plenty of open space for optimal viewing. There are also lots of seating benches to allow you to reflect on a painting you may happen to enjoy.Be sure to watch the 30 minute movie on the museum's founder. It's quite worthwhile.,Michael B
50,Lovely lunch in the Garden Cafe,"Everyone else went to the USC graduation, but we were excused, so we met friends for lunch here today. It was cold and overcast, and we were quite worried, as there are no indoor tables. Everything is outdoors. However, it cleared up a bit, and this area is so sheltered, that we sat there for three hours without sweaters, and had a lovely time.My husband and I shared a ""Smoked Salmon on Brioche"" sandwich, and we each had a beer. Our friends, who had driven up from Redondo Beach (and had to drive back), drank coffee with their 3 cheeses grilled sandwich. We also shared a piece of the freshest Lemon Merigue Pie for dessert. The food was delicious.We got there early, and snatched a waterside table for four. A flock of Canadian Geese has decided to nest in that pond area, so security stayed alert that visitors don't get too close, as those geese can be bad tempered if they feel that their eggs are being threatened.It was such a treat visiting with friends in this lovely setting. We were the first to arrive, and the last to leave. This Cafe has many tables, and they were all taken the entire time that we were there. No admission charge to go to the Cafe or the Gift Store.",NYU62
50,Stunning Museum,"The Norton Simon is one of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited, with a world-class collection of art. I'm always surprised that it is not more busy. The gardens are beautiful and the cafe is excellent. The 19th Century art collection is not to be missed and the early 20th Century pieces are exceptional.",fruitcat

50,Giverny in Pasadena and a Lot More!,"Why did I wait over 10 years to revisit this lovely museum? Have no idea. So glad I went back.We started inside with the old masters, quickly moving through 6 centuries of paintings--from the 14th to the 19th--which while grand to some were mostly dark and grumpy to us. Different strokes and 31 flavors, ya know.Reaching the 20th century works we were happy. Lots of creative modern art. There was also a special exhibit ""Maven of Modernism, Life and Times of Galka Scheyer"" featuring the life, times and art of this amazing woman--art entrepreneur, dealer, lecturer--who brought modern European art to California. We were fascinated to learn about Galka.Thence to the Sculpture Garden, one of the most amazing cultural oases in Greater Los Angeles. No joke, this is Monet's Giverny plunked smack in the middle of Pasadena. The harmony of nature and art is very much in keeping with European tradition. Every art lover should pay a visit. The flora is lovely, the art and layout are incredible, and the drakes and geese act like they own the place. Somehow this all works like a finely orchestrated Brandenburg Concerto. Geese, wind in the willows, water lilies and modern masters' sculptures all combine into a divine rhythm. Try it!",aresverde
40,Drop-in Visit before Dinner,"My husband and I arrived at 3:30 p.m., but left at 5:00 p.m. for a dinner reservation in Pasadena. We viewed the Rotari's Muses exhibit (through July 31, 2017), and the 17th & 18th Century galleries, plus part of the 19th Century Gallery. Very comfortable, spacious rooms; quiet and uncrowded while we were there.",leebee68
40,"Good exhibits,",This is a really good art museum. If you are interested in impressionists and other greats like Rembrandt this is a good place to go. Even my 9 year old who is studying these artists in school was impressed.,derek d
30,"Good art, badly lit","They have good art, and some excellent art, but the top inch or two of most pictures is hidden in shadow. The museum uses thick frames, with spotlights on the ceiling almost directly over the pictures, so shadows hide the top of each picture. Most museums have multiple spotlights farther away, to ensure the whole picture is lit.I also agree with the reviewer who noted highly reflective glass on too many pictures. If they can't use non-glare glass, they need to ensure a plain background opposite the picture, so we can see the picture without reflections of something else.",tripyrr
50,Excellent Degas Collection,"Overall, a great presentation of various works by European masters, but the Degas collection caught my eye. Many pieces by this famed impressionist - more than I've seen in any US gallery except maybe the MMA in NY. Very relaxed, uncrowded - definitely a must see museum when in LA.",aspen5
50,A Must-See for Art Lovers and Those Hoping to be Art Lovers,"This lovely little museum in Pasadena holds an extensive collection of Degas, Renoir, Gauguin, Cézan, Monet, Picasso,Rembrandt,Van Gogh and others. On the lower level of the museum is an excellent collection of sculpture from South and Southeast Asia spanning 2000 years. The smaller size of the museum makes for an intimate tour that can be completed in 1-2 hours. A delightful water/sculpture garden and the Garden Cafe make a nice spot to relax. The cost of admission is reasonable and students with ID are admitted for free. Parking is on the grounds and is free. The staff is helpful and knowledgeable about the collection..",Ionagirl
50,Who knew Pasadena had a world class art museum,"I've passed by here millions of times, and finally decided to check it out and I was thoroughly impressed. LACMA can be such a chore, and takes all day to not see much art. Norton Simon is small, and chock full of masters, without a lot of people. Shaded parking, important in Socal. Pleasant little garden, and located within walking distance of Old Town Pasadena. All the makings of a cultured, stress free afternoon.",Jenny
50,"Great, manageable-sized art museum with outstanding pieces","Amazing that this collection has such a great couple of pieces by so many famous painters/sculptures through so many genres, as well as excellent pieces from Southeast Asia. This is not an overwhelming museum where fatigue can set in. Instead it is very easy to see almost everything they have in 2- 21/2 hours and not feel rushed.Definitely an uplifting experience and a good place to spend a rainy day.",Karen and Doug S
40,WONDERFUL MUSEUM!,"The Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, CA is located not very far from Old Town Pasadena, where you can shop and stroll and enjoy tons of restaurants, etc. The museum offers free parking and has a small sculpture garden outside. Inside, there is a lot of interesting art work for you to take in. There's also a lower level, on which there is even more art. Should you want a snack, they also have a little cafe as well as a gift shop. This is a perfect activity for a rainy or very hot day, because you'll be inside. It's easy to spend the whole afternoon here, they really do have some very nice art pieces. I'm no art expert (far from it!:), but I was here for around 3 hours. I can see someone who is really into art spending a whole day here. They must offer work shops or art classes, because in one of the rooms there was a group of people with an instructor, painting or drawing. I would recommend this place to anyone who has a open mind to art, it's worth visiting.",Tina C
50,Be uplifted!,We spent a few hours of a rainy afternoon with so many of the greatest artists on the planet you had to come away uplifted and appreciative. Rodin sculptures greet you as you enter each century has a glorious collection of paintings beautifully displayed with indirect light. The staff are helpful and unobtrusive. The gardens unfortunately were not open due to the rain but we will see them next time. The cafe offered an peaceful outdoor patio to enjoy a snack and talk about all we'd enjoyed. A great way to spend an afternoon in Pasadena.,Debbie D
50,Pasedena Art Night,We were lucky enough to see this museum for free as part of the art night events. It was crowded with a good mix of people. The staff were very courteous. We were latecomers so it was a quick visit.The testimony is that I would happily revisit and pay the entrance fee.These were the two artefacts I loved I am sure you will find ones of your own,Safari606660
50,Art Can Blow You Away,"The Norton Simon collection has to be one of the world's finest, and tucked away as it is just west of downtown Pasadena, and perhaps a bit of a secret as well. We toured a limited number of galleries, but only because we were so overwhelmed by the quality of the exhibited pieces. We started with an Impressionist gallery, seeing pieces by famous artists which we hadn't seen before. Apparently the Simon must not lend a lot of their pieces to other exhibitions, but that's fine with me because looking at a gallery with 12 paintings, eleven of which I would die to own was revelatory.The first gallery had pieces by van Gogh, Cezanne, Vuillard, and Matisse among others. They were wonderful examples of each artist and seeing them for the first time was exciting!The next gallery was more contemporary with Braque, Picasso and others, one of which was Lyonell Feininger. His piece in this gallery was so stunningly beautiful that we took a lot of extra time looking at it again and again. It had both a depth and a lucidity that I was unable to match in any of the subsequent rooms. As we were leaving the museum, we were drawn back to view it yet again.Another feature of this extremely well-designed building was an ability to see several galleries ahead, and what drew us through those rooms to the last one in this wing was a distant view of a huge installation by the American contemporary artist Sam Francis. Just getting to it was a thrill. The installation was three huge canvases, one perhaps twenty feet across by ten or twelve feet high. On an adjoining wall were two more very tall but thin canvases hung side by side but identical in composition, so all three had been done at the same time. I loved the freedom of these pieces, and their vivid colors as well.We were finally lured away by the equisote outdoor gardens and pondside cafe where we enjoyed without guilt some delicious and creative pastries. The Norton Simon is a genuine treasure - thank heavens our son lives in Pasadena as I think I will be visiting this shrine many more times! Bravo, Pasadena, for this arresting structure and its incalculably fine collection.",William N
50,A gem!! Both the museum itself and the gardens!!,"Similar to the Guggenheim museums around the world, the Norton Simon art collection is a museum on a human scale. You can visit it in a could of hours, and be able to take it in, without getting tired or dizzy. It has some amazing pieces of art. On the sculpture side, for example it has, from the piece-de-resitance Bird in Flight by Constantin Brancusi, to a couple of Giacometti works, a number of Henry Moore scuplture, Auguste Rodin, Barbara Hepworth, Degas, Aristide Maillol. The painting includes important pieces of some of the classics such as Rubens and Rembrandt etc, but I was amazed by the richness of the late 19th and 20th century paitings: Van Gough, Renoir, Degas (quite a few), Manet, Monet, Cezanne, Pisarro, Picasso, Kandinski etc. There is a nice cafe outside, from where you can admire the nice pond and the gardens, which contain a number of sculptures by Moore, Maillol, Hepworth. LOVED IT!",yakshaver
50,Must see for art lovers,"I've been to Norton Simon museum 3 times and every time I find it fantastic. I especially like the impressionist art collection, you can find many Degas statues and paintings, love his ballerinas. I loved it so much that I bought reprints from the gift shop and framed them. Besides Degas you can find impressionist and post-impressionist paintings by Manet, Corbet, Renoir, Corot, Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin and my favorite Claude Monet. There are also sculptures by Rodin. Entrance is $12.",Tsion A
50,Even though overcrowded - it was fantastic,"I loved every minute of it and would definitely go there again. Till the end of the day there were many people but it still allowed me to admire fantastic works. Only Louvre and Rijksmuseum impressed me with a comparable amount of classic painters, Impressionists, post impressionists, etc.",Chihiro L

50,Perfectly splendid collection- do not miss,The Norton Simon is one of the finest private museums in the world. It is a must see - a superlative collection- where to begin? The Rodins and the rest of the incredible sculpture garden - a breathtaking Zubaran still life- the impressionist and post collection especially Degas and Van Gogh are worth the visit alone. Terrific Manets- splendid works in the Galka Scheyer collection- the Blaue Ryder and others- Rembrandts- and on the lower level South Asian artworks including a magnificent Chola bronze Siva Nataraja. Extraordinary and too many delectable works to be listed in a few words.,castlegreenph
50,Second visit as good as the first,"It had been a while since we had been to this museum, but we had some time to kill with friends and decided to go back. Our return visit reminded me again that this is a jewel of a museum, something like the Courtauld Gallery in London or the Phillips Gallery in Washington. In other words, a small museum containing a collection of extraordinarily high quality art. Definitely a must visit if you have a free afternoon in Pasadena!",SteveandMolly
50,Don't miss this hidden gem!,"Small by some museum standards, Norton Simon is certainly a crown jewel. A smattering of a variety of artists like Renoir, Rembrandt, Van Gogh were all represented here. Beautifully displayed with appropriate lighting and captivating plaques with a paragraph about each painting. With four wings there is enough here to warrant the trip. Parking is plentiful unless you are later arriving. A lovely garden cafe overlooks the sculpture gardens.",Karen M
50,This is a gem!,"Make a point of visiting The Norton Simon Museum while you are in Pasadena - there is a shocking amount of world class art right here in this little jewel box! Monet, Degas, Rodin, Renoir, Canaletto, and so much more. Walking distance from Old Town Pasadena but with easy parking as well, it's easily accessible. It's a small museum that you can see in a couple of hours, and that will leave you feeling like you have been around the world.",Buckeyetoyou
50,Amazing collection,"This relatively small museum has an amazing collection of impressionist painters as well as the old masters. In addition to Van Gogh, Manet, Monnet, Picasso, just to mention a few, three Rembrandt paintings are on display! In the basement is a fantastic display of Indian and Asian sculptures and objects. Convenient and pleasant cafe that offers shaded seating in the sculpture garden.",Bernard V

50,Top notch collection,"Covers a lot of art history in a small but elegant Frank Gehry building with an exquisite sculpture garden. Highlights include a Raphael Madonna and child, a virtually unknown Henri Rousseau, a mesmerizing Zubaran still life, and a bold and beautiful Ribera of flower vendor with enormous calla lilies. It's a destination museum you can spend hours enjoying.",Brother B
50,Norton Simon Museum,"The Norton Simon is central to Old Town Pasadena has easy parking and a very reasonable admission cost. The Simon has a beautiful collection of Degas, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh among others. As you enter the museum you will experience a Rodin sculpture garden. If you need a break you can enjoy a snack in the rear garden. Recently, we saw the largest collection of Picasso prints. Unfortunately, although Norton Simon owns these prints they are on exhibit for a short time and they go back into the volt until the next time.",marta469
50,Amazing,"I live in Pasadena since 2014, and drive past the museum on a daily basis.I can't believe I hadn't visited before. Simply: Amazing.

Amazing display of post-war Picasso lithographs on display, giving a window into his process and experimentation. The outdoor cafe is charming.",rewillett
50,Wonderful Paintings and a Beautiful Sculpture Garden,"The Norton Simon Museum is one of those small gems not to be missed. An eclectic, but fine collection of art from the Renaissance to the 20th century, it is set against the backdrop of Monet’s garden at Giverny, reimagined and rich with 19th and 20th century sculptures. The lower galleries house South and Southeast Asian paintings and sculpture.Museum highlights can be enjoyed in a two-hour walk through the museum, but if you have the energy and the will, plan a longer stay.",Jeff C

Getting in is very easy for this old gimp.We went mostly to see the collection of Old Dutch Masters. To say that I was impressed would be a serious understatement.Also the gift shop was extremely clean, well ordered and had lots of neat goodies. I was able to do a lot of Xmas shopping there. For small gifts for friends and other nice folks.Anyways I most highly recommend this joint to refesh ones soul. While in the area.",David L
50,Gem of a Museum,"This was my third visit to this museum. The art Norton Simon amassed is beyond incredible. I've read his autobiography and was anxious for another visit to this museum. Make sure you see the film of his life. This museum also holds many art expert lectures that are not to be missed; ask when you buy your ticket. The museum shop is excellent. I have too much to say about this lovely museum, so all I can concisely say is it is simply not to be missed.",Gloria B
50,An Uncommon Art Museum,"An afternoon at the Norton Simon Museum is one well spent. The galleries are expansive and the central garden is beautiful. The 2D interior works are displayed in a way that draws the viewer into close examination. What is uncommon is that the most significant 2D works in the collection are covered in non-reflective glass. On a practical level, this reduces the cost of insuring masterpieces. Gallery staff noted that visitors either love or hate this means of display. I fell into the former category because the works were much more accessible. There was no objection when I stuck my nose within a couple of inches of a Van Gogh, Picasso or Monet. Such close scrutiny allows for a careful examination of brush stroke and technique. You will also find, of course, the requisite gift shop and cafe on site. A great way to spent a chunk of a day in L.A.",Larry Malone
50,One of the most beautiful museums,The museum has a great location. Is incredible the collection that the museum owns. All the staff is really helpful.It is recommended to give plenty of time to each one of the rooms. The gardens are beautiful.,Honey B

50,A very nice museum in,"We stopped by the museum knowing they have a number of Van Goghs on loan, including the bedroom. The museum has different rooms for periods from the 15th century onward plus a floor for Asian Art and a sculpture garden. I had expected to skip the earlier periods which often focus on religious art but in fact there was almost none of that. These periods, also comprised some fantastic portraits and landscapes.A thoroughly enjoyable 2 hours, although you could probably spend much longer if you are a true art lover.",grizzly_travel
50,Amazing collections,"This is a smaller museum but elegant and well laid out. The Rodain sculptures are particularly amazing. On my visit I saw many of the greats, Picasso, Cezanne, Manet, etc. the gardens are lovely and well worth a visit.",michelle d
50,A 1/2 day museum,"The Norton Simon is a great 1/2 day museum to introduce your kids to fine art through the ages.

50,Beautiful !,"So much to see, this building houses some of the most beautiful pieces of art. On some days you may see students on field trips, but the place is big enough for everyone. Easy to get to off major freeway, ample parking. Admission price is very low compared to other museums. There is also a wonderful out door garden with many shady spots. Would highly recommend a trip, you won't regret it. Museum is located at end of Old Town Pasadena, take a walk down Colorado Blvd.",mimi482
50,Don't Miss This Gem at Any Cost,"Packed full of priceless treasures. For a few dollars, one can see the world's finest artists from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries. A feast of Impressionist and Post Impressionist works, especially those of Degas, Van Gogh, Manet and many others.

You will not be disappointed.",A H
40,beautiful place to spend a day,"I have found my many visits to the Norton Simon to feel magical. It begins with the sculptured, grassy walk to the entrance and the surprise upon entering to see that the museum surrounds a wondrous outdoor sculpture garden with a lily pond. It is a haven - you'd never know the busy 210 is running by on the other side of the wall. I've seen many wonderful exhibitions; one of the most memorable was a Van Gogh. The museum store is definitely worth a visit; great selection of art books and gifts. There is not a restaurant, but there is an informal serve-yourself café in the garden. Remember that Pasadena summers get blisteringly hot and you will not find cool solace in the café.",VKN_11

50,"World Class art, but right sized","The Norton Simon Museum has some really great pieces of art, but it is not overpowering and exhausting to visit because it is right sized. In a couple hours at a leisurely pace you can take in and appreciate everything, with maybe another hour to stroll through and absorb the sculpture garden. Absolutely worth the time and effort to visit.",dven8
40,Worth the time and effort to visit,We were in Old Pasadena waiting for our flight out of Burbank later in the evening. We were visiting Old Pasadena are and were were glad that we decided to walk down Colorado Blvd to this museum. We spent a few hours and loved it. Not big like a Getty museum but large enough to have a nice variety of art to attract different tastes. The museum was peaceful but fairly crowded the week after Christmas. The building is modern and the grounds are nicely kept. It was a nice way to spend some time before catching our flight home. We would recommend this museum to family and friends.,AaronI
50,There is more to Pasadena than the Rose Bowel parade,"This is our second visit to the Norton Simon. It is a jewel. From the Degas statues to the early Monet seascapes to the Van Goghs up to the old Dutch masters, yes including Rembrandt, and through to Picasso the collection is amazing. Especially when one considers that it was amassed by one collector and his foundation.And when you think you are done, take a break and go into the sculpture garden with its lily pond. Grab a snack and a drink and enjoy a zen moment.We drove 2 hours from where we were staying in Southern California to visit the Norton Simon and 2 hours back. The best review I could give is to say that when our excursion ended my wife turned to me and said ""I'm glad we went.""Oh, when we return to Southern California next year, and the next...., we'll take the 2 hour drive again to visit the Norton Simon no matter how crazy our relatives think we are. It will be like visiting a beloved old friend.",Leslie b
50,Well worth the trip !,"We drove down from Ventura . I was originally from San Gabriel Valley and hadn't visited in years and am wondering what took us so long. Excellent impressionist paintings with wonderful Van Goughs. I never got to the other european art I was so intrigued with the impressionists, Picasso's lithographs and the drop dead asian art.Very helpful staff and small but nice gift shop. Parking is plentiful. A great place to visit if you love art and art history. Rodin's The Burgers of Calai were in front as you enter, doesn't get better than that !",DD633
30,Nice modern building and grounds,"I don't have an eye for art, but I still enjoyed our visit to this museum. It was a walkable distance from the Pasadena Marriott Hotel. Wings of the museum are setup by time periods. The modern art wing was of no interest to me. I tend to stop and read each description so I was tired by the time we finished 2 wings. But, we did head downstairs to see the sculptures. There is a nice patio cafe for refreshments.",Rita B
50,High quality artwork in a modern building,"The Norton Simon Museum is wonderful. At most museums I have a short attention span, but this time I was captivated by the variety of the permanent collections. The descriptions next to each painting are especially informative, providing historical context plus details about the artists’ life and painting style. The main level of the museum is nicely organized into four wings, each with a major art collection: 14-16th century, 17-18th century, 19th century, and 20th century.The museum’s lower level is dedicated to Asian art from India, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, China, Japan and more. When you arrive downstairs, on the curving wall near the stairway are explanations and diagrams explaining the symbolism you’ll see in four major styles of Asian art, including Buddhist and Hindu. Large stone artifacts from archaeological sites like Angkor Wat were impressive, but made me wonder how they were acquired. No sign explains this and it is a sensitive issue nowadays. Perhaps it is discussed in the 30-minute film featured in the theatre, which I missed.The informal café on the patio has outdoor seating next to the pond and sculpture garden. It provided a relaxing outdoor break for my eyes after viewing so much artwork indoors. Salads, sandwiches, soup, desserts, hot and cold beverages plus beer and wine are available. I visited on a Saturday and worried about finding a parking space at 2pm, but there was no problem. A holiday weekend would likely have been much busier. Overall, the Norton Simon collections are impressive for their quality.",CJSArizona
40,Great Museum,A must see if you enjoy art. The special exhibit right now is of Picasso's early lithographs. The grounds and building are excellent with a cafe as well. Make sure you have at least 1-2 hours to browse through.,Tyler D
50,an eclectic collection obtained by Norton Simon,Very peaceful. Relatively small. snack bar. After his wife suggested they visit India he accumulated magnificent Indian art.

40,Cambodian Art!,"I have come here for several exhibitions and to just tour the permanent collection. The museum has a Van Gogh painting I love to look at for the colors!! Anyway, the most memorable for me, beside all the Rodin sculptures, is the Cambodian art they have on display year-round. I have been to Cambodia twice now and seen Angkor Wat complex. The only thing I wonder, is how the pieces were acquired, so far I have never bothered to look into it but sometimes one wonders these things to make sure it is legit!",Barbra B

We enjoyed it a lot !!!",Gloria R
50,Super nice and beautiful!,"I really love this museum. First, the Thinker is just outside the museum, and there are more statues outside the museum. Second, the paintings, statues, others inside the museum is very elegant. There is big Buddism exhibition. There is also a big garden, that's very quiet and you can enjoy a coffee there. Parking is very easy, and it's also very close to Rose Bowl and Old Pasadena.",Jin Y

It's a must !!,Tsvika
50,Light Lunch Wine and Art,I was so excited to meet a new friend at the Museum. She had given guided tours of the Asian collect in the past and knew everyone well. We sat for a sip and a taste of food at the cafe. I had not been in a while and knew nothing of the upgraded care area So much to my surprise I felt nothing but joy. As well we sat in sight of the emaculate grounds as we talked. After dining we walked the grounds and took photos of some of the wonderful art. Oh how I would love to have such art in my yard. My host lead me to the book store where she explained the outstanding collecting of art books and praised the manager of the book store for his selection. We moved on as she explained to me intricate chess board. I think she said India had invented chess. We move along briefly visiting other sites in the hall way. Yes you can lunch at the Norton Simon walk the grounds and see a few Chinese statues along the way on a short visit. I recommend visiting often so you can tour the permanent collection or other times attending a lecture or film in the lovely movie room. Then save a visit for the Chinese collection.,just910

50,A small gem offering an intimate look at notable masterpieces,"An outstanding collection of works by Edgar Degas is just one of many highlights in this lovely museum. Small when compared to ""top-tier"" museums, the Simon nonetheless has spacious, well-lit, uncrowded galleries that allow art lovers to gaze as long as they like at works by Cezanne, Renoir, Van Gogh, Goya, Rembrandt, and many other masters. I was surprised and impressed by the range of artists represented. A serene sculpture garden beckons visitors outdoors, and a small cafe offers snacks and light meals. Conveniently located at one end of downtown Pasadena, there's really no excuse for art lovers to miss this fine museum. In fact, if you're someone who's overwhelmed by mega-institutions that require a full-day visit, this is an appealing and highly rewarding destination.",Kamala4812

50,The 30 minute movie is very interesting,"Our youngest daughter lives in the area, and as we visit her often, we have visited this Museum at least half a dozen times. I never reviewed it, as what is there to say? This Museum has so many masterpieces, that today, (10/6) we spent over four hours there, and wished that we had had another hour. On Thursdays, they are open noon to five.The Museum Cafe has improved. About eight years ago, we met friends for lunch there, and it was such an unexpected disappointment. We love Museum restaurants, and always enjoy a nice meal at just about all of them. Here, the catering seemed to come from Costco. Large unappetizing portions prepackaged in clear plastic containers, and very few choices. The Cafe setting is among the loveliest but, the food was uneatable, and all four of us left it in their plastic. Today, we enjoyed our lunch. We split a ""Ham on Rye"" sandwich, and a Bass beer. The sandwich was freshly made and tasty. I saw no prepackaged sandwiches.We always enjoy browsing in the Gift Shop, and I've often bought my Christmas cards here, but they are not out yet this year. There are more guards (inside and outside) here, than we have ever seen in any Museum anywhere. Not surprising, when, most likely, there is nothing here valued at less than several million dollars, and you can get very close to the masterpieces.Every day, at 12:30 and 3pm, they show an interesting 30 minute movie about Norton Simon. It's shown in their Theater, which has the most comfortable cushiony seats, and the slope is such that there is a good view from any seat. Today, we watched the movie for the third time. We really enjoy hearing about how his passion for art developed. Surprisingly, so few people come to watch the movie. Today, there were only five of us in the Theater. It is very well worth seeing.",NYU62

Lived in Southern California for many years and don't think I had ever made it out to Norton Simon! I bought my 9 year old and she enjoyed it as well. We didn't tour the whole museum rather focused on impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture. They have a great collection of Degas works and my daughter is a ballet student, so it was a special treat. My ideal length of time at a museum is 1 to 2 hours, so we skipped the Asian art collection and hope to see at a later visit. There is a nice cafe outside near small water display with coffees and cakes. Gift shop has books, prints, posters and small gifts for kids.

The present collection and its organization give the visitor an art history education while showcasing some of the most iconic art pieces extant.

The bronze collection outside is equally impressive, and all the art is well-presented.There is a café outside in the garden area with light lunch and snacks, all of it rather eclectic fare as you would expect at an art museum. Good enough in its way, though.The grounds and the building itself are well-kept presentations of late 20th-century architecture and landscaping done by prominent professionals of the time.We had a very enlightening visit to a place we didn't know existed.

50,A Jewel,"We have traveled extensively, and this jewel of a museum was a welcome surprise.The museum is situated in downtown Pasadena. Everything about the venue is welcoming, from the (free) parking, to the staff,to the well organized layout. We purchased the audio guides and it was well worth the investment.Plan on spending several hours here. We were there for four plus hours and didn't cover everything.There is also a lovely cafe in the sculpture garden. We shared a delicious sandwich and welcomed the opportunity to rest our feet.Mr. Simon gave the public a great gift. How lucky are we??",Pat O
50,What a jewel!,The garden inspired by Monet never disappoints. The collections are wonderful. A small but jam packed jewel.,Amy D
50,Size doesn't matter,"What a wonderful museum - not too big, not too crowded but with some of the best of the best artists. Just walking in, there are Rodin sculptures. Top artists are represented spanning early centuries to relatively modern. Lovely oriental art collection on the ground floor. We went during a major heat wave so didn't go into the sculpture gardens. Something to look forward to. Museum had easy parking and was as easy to access as anything in the greater LA area. Definitely worth the trip.",Bea A

50,A Pasadena Treasure,"The Pasadena area has quite a few excellent museums, and this is certainly one of them. I hadn't been there in years when I recently visited and there was so much more to it than I remembered. They have a fabulous collection of European art spanning 8 centuries from the 14th century to the 21st century. It includes amazing works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Braque, Degas, Botticelli and many, many others. The collection is extensive. The museum also has a large collection of Indian and Southeast Asian art, as well as 20th century sculpture in a lovely garden. The gift shop is quite nice and the cafe in the garden is a perfect way to relax. Another nearby place to visit is the Gamble House.",letsgotochina
50,Amazing display of Twentieth Century Art,"We spent so much time in the Twentieth Century Wing that we were unable to see anything else. I loved the lay out of the room and that natural light is utilized.Picasso, Klee, Manet, Modigliani, Riveria and so many other great pieces of Art from the 19th and 20th Centuries...The sculpture garden is a peaceful setting too. We look forward to another visit in the future.",Andrew M
50,Amazing art collection,"If you enjoy art, this museum in Pasadena is a must see. We only had a few hours on a Saturday evening (when the museum is open until 8pm).We chose to spend a portion of that time in the theatre listening to a jazz trio performing numbers they connected to art pieces on exhibit at the museum. A great way to merge the arts.We enjoyed a rest and beverage sitting by the pond in the lovely sculpture garden.The remainder of our time was spent on the first floor in the 19th and 20th century section which contained a great impressionist collection (including a number we had never seen before).We will definitely return to explore the rest of this excellent museum.",booptraveler
50,Perfect place to spend the day looking at great art famous names we know,"Some of the greats like Rembrandt and Picasso, from renaissance to impressionist and more. I love the two rooms of Degas, some I have already seen and some new. I have not seen his little sculptures before, the big one of the 14 year old dancer is one of my faves. A sweet outside area with Rodin and more life size sculptures and garden. Like to com back every time I visit PasadenaI",J H
50,What an amazing way to spend an afternoon solo in Pasadena!,"Besides a spectacular collection, where you can visit with some of our great old friends-- unforgettable works by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Hals, Rubens, Watteau, Fragonard, Chardin, van Ruysdael, Degas, Matisse, Gauguin, Manet, Morisot, Klee, Kandinsky, Picasso, Modigliani, Toulouse-Lautrec, Rivera, Brancusi, Giacometti, Rodin, Moore, Sam Francis, Motherwell, Noguchi, Hepworth, Rothko, to name a few notable stars; plus there is an amazing collection of Asian works, as well as great blockbuster shows like ""the Duchamp to Pop"" -- not to be missed.What better summertime treat than spending the day here to enjoy a morning of old and new masters, revisited in air conditioned comfort, then lunching in the spectacular sculpture garden, luminous in verdant and golden light by the lily pond.... Monet, eat your heart out! Who cares what you eat, if you can relax, strolling around in the shade, watching dragonflies grazing the dappled water, overseen by Moore's & Maillol's royalty?",TheWhiteRoad

40,Children's art experience,I took my nephews to the summer art experience.The educators were very interesting & the art projects were very creative. The kids learned about art through the art projects.This is not a place for high energy children as the adults & volunteers have little patience for that sort of behavior but the children's educators were just amazing! I highly recommend taking your children here for a great experience.,Amy T
50,Surprising museum,"Surprisingly great pieces in small museum. Many impressionist pieces. Beautiful courtyard and sculpture garden. This one rivals larger, more crowded LA museums. Quiet location with an extensive collection of van gogh, Picasso, Renoir, and degas",Corinne T
50,Chilling with the Canvases!,"Every few years, my soul needs to see great art. This is such an amazing collection. The Van Goghs, the religious art, the sculptures. They have an amazing collection of art from India, Cambodia, and the garden makes you feel like you have escaped the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles. The cafe is reasonable. The gift store has a great selection. Why don't I go here more often?",Karyn B
50,World Class Art in a small space,A beautiful and significant collection of wonderful artists and over a long span of time. Worth the trip to see so much is very little time. The gardens are peaceful and the statues fun to find as you stroll through. Good for little ones who need to expend energy (without the guards getting wary).,Gregandnikki

40,Great for a few hours,"I was curious to check out the museum because I've never been and after going to Europe and visiting their museums I needed to get my art fix. I live in Irvine so it was about an hour and ten minutes away. I went on a Monday afternoon and it was not very busy. Perfect for my visit. It is not a very big museum but decent. I was surprised by the artists they featured. They had works by Van Gogh, Matisse, Goya, Picasso, Rafael, Warhol and Rembrandt, to name a few. They also have some Asian sculptures down stairs in the lower part of the museum. If you're hungry they have a little cafe out back which I did not try but many were eating. Overall a nice time but I probably won't be back for a while as its not very big. If you have been, I suggest you visit. Like I said,it's great for a few hours...",JohnR92656
50,worth the visit,"Membership is 75.00 per year, and gets you in with a guest. Regular admission is 10 or 12 USD.Rembrandt's unfinished portrait, one of Picasso's self portraits, and several other very special pieces make it worth the visit. Presentation is incredibly familiar, you can get two feet away from these masterpieces, try doing that at the Louvre.",Ed Bannister
50,A Major Pride of Pasadena,You'll never be able to get this close to a Renoir in Paris or New York. Delightful if limited sandwich cafe in the Matisse garden. Brilliant Indian Art exhibition downstairs. Duchamp to Pop exhibition underscored local art history.,Oldmercutio
40,Underappreciated Cultural Resource,"My wife and I have lived in Pasadena for nearly 30 years and had only ventured into the Norton Simon a handful of times until we both retired. Now, with time on our hands and looking for things to do, we revisited the Norton Simon and were pleasantly surprised.From the outside, the building is a low, brown tiled 70's structure that doesn't exactly draw in much traffic. However, once inside, the building is quite light, with high ceilings in the galleries that give the impression of a much larger structure. The main entrance to the building frames a view of the central gardens and pond located between wings of the building. With a Giverny-like setting, the garden is very attractive and a great place to have a quick meal or to give bored children space to burn off some energy.The permanent collection of the museum focuses on Asian and European, but also has a large collection of modern art acquired from a significant donation in 1953, and later from the collection of industrialist Norton Simon, after whom the museum was renamed 1975. The Norton Simon has the obligatory museum store, but is more focused on art books and related materials, rather than the typical trinkets, toys and/or jewelry. In the gardens is a cafe catered by the Patina. While the menu is limited, box lunches may be arranged for groups and beer and wine are available.Admission is $12 for adults ($9 for seniors) and children under 18 are free. Parking is also free. For locals, an annual membership ($75) may make more sense and comes with a number of member-related benefits, including free admission to movies that are screened in the museum's auditorium.The Norton Simon is another Pasadena treasure that everyone living in or visiting the area should visit. Especially on hot days, a visit to the cool galleries of the Norton Simon and/or a quiet lunch by the pond offer a very attractive alternative to a visit to a mall.",U028477
50,Always enjoyable,"They have a very nice collection of European art from the 14th through 19th centuries. There is a very extensive collection of work by Edgar Degas. There is also some modern and contemporary art, some of which is just stupid, but fortunately that doesn't make up the bulk of the museum. Outside there is a pleasant sculpture garden around a pond. Downstairs is a vast collection of Asian art. If you are interested at all in Asian art, this is definitely the place to go, with works from many different countries.Tickets are reasonable: adults $12, seniors $9, children and students free. There is enough to see that it may not be possible to cover it all in one visit.",Rosemary W
50,Definitely a don't miss place!,Fabulous art in a peaceful setting. Plan to spend a few hours and include the cafe for lunch. Hours are short (12-5pmPST) and there is much to see. The gift shop is wonderful as well. The only negative is the overwhelming number of security folks who can be somewhat distracting/annoying. Also do not carry anything larger than a purse into the museum or you will have to check it. You can take pictures without flash.,Kris M
40,Local highlight,"You will not find an art museum comparable to the Met in NYC or the National Gallery in DC in a place like Pasadena. That said, the Norton Simon is definitely worthwhile. Our only negative is that the offerings in their café could be better. Suggest you lunch elsewhere.",Michael G
50,One of Southern California's Gems,"Norton Simon was a private collector with an amazingly wide areas of interest. His collection is rotated (his collection is 10 times the capacity of the museum) through one of the most accessible settings imaginable. Indoors and out, hidden away in Pasadena this museum is well worth the trip.",Michael1661
50,Peaceful,"If you ever wanted to escape and not leave the city, This is the place to go. It has a variety of art mediums...my favorite the Monet and Van Gogh paintings. The gardens are beautiful, peaceful and restful.",Markeen F
50,Fantastic art in a beautiful setting.,I am so glad a friend took me to this museum. It has an eclectic assortment of paintings and sculptures from modern to the middle ages. There are also beautiful grounds to discover.,Brendan K
40,Several good paintings and a museum worth visiting.,"The Norton Simon (formerly the Pasadena Art Museum) is a relatively small museum with some interesting works. My husband characterized it as ""second tier works by first tier artists and first tier works by second tier artists."" Not that this should dissuade you from going--It was a lovely 2-hour visit for us. (We are not fond of Asian sculpture nor a lot of Renaissance art). The outdoor upper sculpture garden is worth a visit due to its interesting sculptures and plant diversity (I love when they tell you what plants are there), but go before it gets too hot in the afternoon in summer. We also enjoyed the impressionist, expressionist, cubist and landscape works very much. There is a very good Van Gogh mulberry tree painting that is also worth a special stop, and the Degas small female sculptures arrayed along the gallery were also notable.If you are in Pasadena, I would recommend a stop to this small museum. It doesn't feel overwhelming, but is a great short trip to see some interesting art.",Notacamper99
50,Amazing collection in a peaceful setting,A great introduction to some of the most famous sculptors and painters in the last 200 years. The sculpture garden is very peaceful and shaded.,John M
50,"Great Museum, Nice Area","This is really a terrific Museum in downtown Pasadena, California. The parking is excellent, and they give discounts for students. My daughter, who is a college student, I was able to get in for free. The art collection is outstanding, and there is an interesting movie about Norton Simon. The gift shop was a little disappointing, but there are beautiful outdoor grounds with a walking path and a nice cafe.",Peter M
50,A beautiful art collection in the heart of Old Town Pasadena,"This is one of the finest private collections in the U.S. It's beautifully displayed and a ""must see"" in Pasadena.

50,Oasis of Calm - the Anti-LA,"What a beautiful, tranquil place! They have some wonderful ""old masters"" - especially Van Gogh and Matisse - and this place is truly a gem. When you need a break from the big crazy city, this is the destination you should seek.",ImagineThatGlass
50,"phenomenal collection, beautiful garden",Terrific and important collection with many many familiar works by great masters. The galleries are well spaced and organized. The outdoor space is lovely with amazing works by henry Moore. The lilly pond is lovely and a very pleasant place to sit after wandering in the galleries.,Earlham99
10,Horrible!,If you want to be stalked while out with your family this is definitely the place to go. My god i had two kids with me 9 and 7 who were well behaved because i know what misbehaving kids are like. Oh trust me it's like a damn guided tour with the security following you around except they dont say anything they just walk behind your back to make sure they dont touch anything.i understand this is a museum with priceless artifacts but jeez. This is extremely uncomfortable.only go here if it's just you and a partner or else prepare to be stalked,Alexis G
50,An understated gem,"I had lived in LA 12 years before I finally got around to visiting the Norton Simon. I had no idea what I was missing! It is an exceptional collection in a beautiful building, with wonderful gardens and outdoor sculptures. I did not expect much and was very surprised to find several Rodin sculptures resting casually on the lawn near the front entrance. They set the tone for a singular collection of exceptional art, and the marvelous garden inspired by Monet's Giverny. Unlike some museums that feel curated by a panel of experts, collecting a piece from each seminal artist, this collection feels personal. You really get a sense of Simon's personal taste and interests, which provides a continuity through the permanent collections. It felt like visiting someone's home, rather than a stodgy, formal museum. I loved it and look forward to returning again and again!",TrampingAuntie
50,A favorite museum,Many great works of art to see. The people who work there know the collection and are very informative. I'm an art teacher and I've taken my students here as well as to LACMA. It was a much more positive experience for them here as they had an actual artist who took them around and let them choose what they wanted to see. They were frustrated at LACMA because the docent had chosen what she liked and reprimanded them when they chose to look at what interested them. The grounds are also quite lovely. The Greene House is closeby and worth a look as well.,Pennie F
50,A magical evening,"I just came back from a magical evening in the garden. A band was playing, adults and children were walking, sitting & drawing their favorite elements in the garden. We had a garden tour with the landscape designer. It was the best evening ever",Janie F

50,Huge impressive art museum,"On a recent visit to LA my family stayed in Pasadena. We decided to visit the Norton Simon Museum in part because TripAdvisor has it listed as the #1 thing to do in Pasadena. We were glad we went.The museum has several different sections on 2 floors: 17th & 18th Centuries, 20th Century, 19th Century, 14th-16th Centuries, a theater, and a sculpture garden.The art is mostly from Europe, but there is a nice Asian collectionThere is a cafe, museum store, and audio tours available. The theatre shows a 30 minute film about Mr. Norton Simon.Photography is allowed without flash for non-commercial use. You can't use a tripod either. Some works on loan may have a label stated you can't photograph them though.There was a fun little family guide that had art to look out for with things to think about and questions for kids and their parents to think about when looking at each piece. It had questions about a Bassano piece depicted Mary and Jesus, a Zurbaran still life, a Rembrandt va Rijn portrait, and Indian sculpture of Shiva, a Van Gogh with discussion of colors, a Picasso with a discussion of realism versus abstract art, and a sculpture of royalty and inspiration artists find for art. The little guide was well organized, easy to follow and a great way to help kids appreciate and think about art more than just looking at it.Hours are Mon/Wed/Thu 12pm - 5pm, Fri/Sat 11am - 8pm, and Sundays 11am-5pm. They are closed Tuesdays, Rose Parade Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.This is a very cool art museum. They reciprocated with our local art museum otherwise prices are Adults $12.00, Seniors (62+) $9.00, Children (18 and under), Students with valid I.D., Museum Members, and Active Military Personnel with valid I.D. are all free.Totally worth the visit.",jelico8
10,Have to agree with last critical review,"The collection is gorgeous, but it is profoundly child-unfriendly. My wife and I experienced unrelenting stress from the security guards about our children making too much noise or coming even close to touching walls and display cases, let alone the actual works of art. A true treasure of Pasadena (I'm a native), but just be forewarned about the extreme vigilance of the staff.",Keith K
10,Worst expletive ever from the security !,"Worst experience ever!This is my second time went to Norton Simon, I love the great art collections there.Expectantly those oil. Paintings, myself is oil painter.I thought people working in museum are appreciated they are around the master pieces of art should be happy, i hope this is just a spcail case happened to me.I am artist and respect all of artworks very much, I even wanted to choose my career to repair artworks like people work Italian museum.I have been to museum around the worldI never had bad experiences like here, hope it's special case ever.It's In the European section, we were at the first floor to the right hall there is female sucreiry punch my back asked"" put your bag to my front""I was with group I recently have reading problem so I use my small LED light point to the tag to read better.She right away come yelling at me"" what are you doing"""" it's not allow to use light here even camera""I was shocked the sucrety gard yelling at me made me embarrassing all of people look at me, that was the white lady wearing glasses punched on my back earlier, she is about 40sto 50s.Instead saying, "" would you don't use the light"" ""it's not allow using any light here""She was yelling at me like her child'. Then right away "" let me call the manager""Then manager come to me I had to explain I didn't know, but she could talk better, she didn't have to yell at me, Because she was interrupting in the middle of the ldisscusdion of Art, I lost my group,a gentleman wearing blue shirt were in the group saw the whole thing, She made big deal out of this I feel innocent ,in just love arts want to enjoy my Friday evening, so I was lost the group, had went back home.But it's not all bad at least I learned, Norton Simin is top secure have strick rules.1If you have back pack should never carry into this museum, even its tiny.2never use light to read the text or art, they will consider you are damaged the artworksSuggestion1 light need to brighter on the text part. 2Discussion- does LED lights cost the artwork damage?

50,Amazing Art Collection! Great Garden Too,"We love art. From the start of our visit, with the Rodin sculptures in the garden on the way in to the amazing collection of 19th and 20th century art to the asian art collection, this is a great place to visit. The garden outdoors is beautiful around a pond with great sculptures. Very relaxing. Great for kids.",Douglas T
50,High end examples by major artists,"No one could create such a collection with private funds the way Norton Simon did. Each piece represents the best of the best, and the space is more than adequate for viewing and studying the art there. Nice outdoor space too.",SteveandMolly
50,"Lovely, yet small, collection, and nice garden","Some really good holdings, although quite a limited selection, especially compared with the Getty Villa or Center. Much more art than the Huntington, I'd say, which is better for its lovely and extensive gardens. The Norton Simon's gardens represent plants that do well in Pasadena's climate.",InMyOopinion
50,Wonderful Experience! Needs a Return Visit.,"I was drawn into the 19th century section of the museum due to Van Gogh's painting of the Provençal peasant Patience Escalier. I did purchase the audio tour (well worth the $3.) and it took me over an hour to complete this section and move onto the 20th century. The collection of artwork in one place is truly amazing. I moved onto the 17th and 18th century, but could only spend a short time which did not due it justice. In order to get the most out of this museum, I will plan another visit the next time I am in LA enjoying the beautiful garden cafe in between the different centuries.",Kathy R

40,Intimate museum with lovely gardens and sculpture,"The Norton Simon Museum has an excellent collection of European masters, but I was most impressed by its collection of Asian sculpture, which was very extensive.

50,One of my favorite museums in the world.,"Every sculpture I've ever loved from museums all over the world was there except for Michelangelo. Practically all of Rodin, Degas, Moore, They were all outside in the loveliest setting. I was all smiles and thrilled on arriving. The Giverney styled lily pond couldn't have been lovelier and was planned to be always in bloom. The art inside the museum was equally wonderful. Renoir, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Giacometti. I returned the next day I was so excited.",lisastark1
50,AMAZING Art Museum... RECOMMENDED!,"WOW! I have to say that I was so impressed by this gem. As a fan of old school classic European art, I had no idea what treasures I would find at the Norton Simon. I initially planned the trip to see The Mulberry Tree which I've been drooling over the last couple of years and got a giant copy on canvas for my office. I felt like I needed to see it in person since it was practically in my backyard. What I didn't know I was going to find was many well known pieces and many beautiful pieces of art by everyone you read about in art history classes. This was a treat.We started our day with the 30 minute film which talks a bit about Norton Simon's life and art collecting, but I have to say I wasn't very impressed with the film. I think it's time for a re-do and to pick up the pace. From there we stopped at the cafe since we were starving. They only have pre-made items and the selection is small but varied. Pricing is what you expect at a museum - sandwiches for $9+. But, the food was actually pretty tasty. No fountain drinks unfortunately, but overall it was okay.Then we worked our way through the museum from the 14th century through the 20th century and it was a truly excellent afternoon. Not only did they have the Mulberry Tree, but several other nice Van Gogh paintings as well. Simon's Degas collection is extensive and beautiful and we were super excited to run across a couple Toulouse Lautrecs! This museum has so many European masters: Rembrandt, Boticelli, Raphael, Rubens, Watteau and of course, the impressionists, which we are fans of. The more modern pieces in the 20th century room aren't really my favorites, but interesting to look at. There is also quite a bit of sculpture both inside out and outside.Downstairs, is the area where Simon's Asian art is on display. It's quite an extensive collection, but not really where our interest lies, so we only viewed it quickly and partially. You'll find a lot of bronze and stone. It's very different and interesting.We did the whole museum between 12-5. It is not large so you can see pretty much everything in a five hour period, depending on how much time you spend on each piece. Also, we wandered on our own versus using the audio tour that is available and from experience, I assume taking the audio tour would increase the amount of time needed to see this museum.I loved it and recommend it!",ladyjadegd
50,Blown Away,"One of the Best small art museums I had ever been to. The collection was amazing as was the proximity of how close you could get to the artwork. One of the best values is the headset to hear about the artwork. most of the work have 2 numbers associated with it one for an adult and one for kids the commentary was great. As an adult it was also interesting to listen to how they related the artwork to kids,",1HudsonLvr
40,love this museum,"This smaller but famous museum has some well known works, especially the Rodin pieces in the sculpture garden outside. The only thing I don't like is that many of the paintings are covered in glass frames so you can't see the brush strokes as easy (I guess they are worried about rude visitors trying to touch the canvases). Nice little courtyard cafe for a snack.",ferdferd
50,Wonderful Collection,This museum is a gem. It has a wide ranging collection of outstanding paintings and sculptures yet is small enough so that you don't feel overwhelmed. It is a must for all art lovers if you are in the LA area.,ross5100
50,Less Is More,"A thoughtful, wonderfully curated collection that is able to appreciated in an afternoon. The architecture inside and out enhances the experience. The range of artists and eras is impressive with particularly good representation of the last 150 years. The outdoor spaces are pleasant and tranquil with excellent sculpture placed in interesting settings. Definitely a must-see when visiting Pasadena or environs.",Joseph M
50,"WHAT A PLEASURE, TO SEE SUCH A COLLECTION. WHO KNEW?","This museum displays about 600 items and as is typical their total collection of 12,000 is largely in storage. On arrival I was greeted by outside Guard Janice, a veteran who was very cordial in answering my questions and getting me oriented. I tried to tour by date and started in the byzantine gallery, then to the renaissance and so forth. Many of the most famous of European artists are represented including Van Gough and Picasso. There is also an excellent display of southeast Asian art in the lower level. I visited for 2.5 hours and moved along fairly fast but did not have time for the garden and outside statuary. This is a must see when in the L.A. area. Who knew? Founded by one man who collected and selected all museum holdings! Nothing has been added to the collection in this privately owned museum since he died. Admission was $12 and $9 for seniors.",flyboy1320
50,"Wonderful surprise, total quality","We were unaware of the splendor of this museum until it was mentioned in passing; fortunately we made the effort to visit and were floored at the quality of the collections, display, grounds, staff. The building is impressive but the best is inside. There is even a small outdoor café to help take in the early California afternoon in the garden of beautiful sculpture. Amazing! So glad we found it.",Carole K
50,"Great, world class museum","I have been wanting to visit the Norton Simon for quite awhile now and I finally had the opportunity to do so. This is a world class museum with artworks from Monet, Renoir, Degas and they even have one of Rembrandt's self portraits. The sculpture garden has some Renoirs and even has an edition of Rodin's The Thinker and St. John the Baptist. There is a garden with pond behind the museum with a small, outdoor cafe. The garden was inspired by Monet's garden in Giverny. A word of warning about the garden: They have some Canadian geese roaming around and you don't want to turn your back on them. They like to get your attention by nipping at your feet.",Dave C
50,Beautiful location and exhibits,Love coming to the Norton Simon when in Pasadena - always something new to see and experience. Location is excellent and very convenient to downtown Pasadena and off the 134 & 210 freeways and Colorado Blvd. Rose Ball parade goes right in front of the hotel!,SFDutchman
50,A charming museum with an excellent location and a lovely garden,"The Los Angeles area has some great museums, including the Getty Museums and this one. We greatly enjoyed the wonderful collection and the very peaceful gardens. We understand that the Broad Museum is also excellent but you must book a time slot and when we checked it out, the earliest available ones were in May!",Michael S
20,Please advise your paying customers if the Sculpture Garden is closed due to rain,"Our visit to the museum was soured by the fact that the sculpture garden was closed. We had been looking forward to visiting the museum and the gardens and on paying to enter we were not advised that the gardens were closed.Also when checking at the information desk whether photos were allowed no one there advised that the garden was closed, and in fact they advised we could use flash photography in the gardens.Only after we had sat at the cafe and then made to move into the garden's did we notice the security guard and the cordon.This is just a highlight to the operators of the museum that the cashier really should have been advising your paying customers that some of your museum was closed rather than us having the disappointment of having to find out ourselves AFTER paying to get in.",A trip advisor from California
50,Amazing collection in a smaller setting,"I am so glad we went too see this museum's well-rounded collection. We planned on going to the Getty later in the week and most of the family wasn't that interested in the Simon. On an afternoon when the winds made the beach unappealing, we made the trip and it was so worth it. Think of it as the Getty on a smaller scale. The Asian Art section in particular is extensive and they have the largest collection of Degas items anywhere, more than the Getty. We all, including two teens, enjoyed the 3+hours we were there.",Sandra W
50,"Small museum, big payoff","I’ve been here many times, and this museum is a wonderful example of great design. Not only does it have some of the finest art in the world, the museum is a perfect size to explore in 2-3 hours. I especially love their collection of Degas ballerina sculptures, which are clustered together in one of the first rooms to the left of the entrance. Leave time to explore the beautiful statue garden outside.",Kristin T
50,Wow,We've seen it on every Rose Bowl parade but never had a chance to go in. Great museum with a little bit of everything. Also a great size- You can see the entire museum in 2-3 hrs.

50,A surprise gem of a museum in downtown Pasadena,This museum looks small from the outside but as I wandered the galleries inside I was very impressed with the breath of this collection. I have lived in Pasadena for many years and finally decided to spend an afternoon there - well worth the visit,tedl01
50,Great Museum!,"This museum is small enough that you can see it in a couple of hours, but large enough to be worth your time. They have a variety of types of art over a wide span of centuries. Don't miss out on the sculptures outside of the museum in front and along Colorado Blvd. The interior sculpture garden is also great! Some of the actual sculptures aren't really my preference, but the setting is beautiful and peaceful! Definitely worth a visit!",hotwheels84

40,We stumbled on this one.,"We had decided on a short excursion to Pasadena while staying in LA and thought we'd check out this Art Museum. It's a 20minute walk fron the Metro Station, has a reasonable entry fee, and a nicely laid out Art collection.. The holdings nclude a handful of lesser works by well known artists, and an extensive, beautifully displayed collection of Asian and Regional carvings and artefacts.Since the Pasadena Old Town didn't really impress it was the saving note of our excursion, but a very worthwhile one. And the overland Metro ride was interesting from a traveller's point of view.",LandC46
50,Great works of art,We spent a Sunday afternoon looking at wonderful works of art. The collection is quite good and varied. The outdoor sculpture garden is nice but part is closed due to aggressive Canada Geese. We were very impressed with the variety of works. My favorite was Van Gogh's Mullberry Tree.,JR_Boulder

50,Visit to Norton Simon Museum,"Spectacular experience visiting this reputable Museum . Never disappoints . There's so much to see and so many famous artists that repeat visits bring much visual joy. With our drought in California they still been able to maintain the beautiful pond area surrounded by statues and the wonderful garden cafe. Whether you have an hour or four hours this museum is worth your time and attention to their professional displays and garnered opinions about the artist the median the time period and styles. I particularly love the analysis given by the curators about the study and time periods as the artists studied under different Masters to develop their styles and attitudes . The visiting artists displays , currently Indian & Tibetan Art are icing on the cake . A beautiful place to escape in Metropolis for contemplation , meditation and visual comfort .",brendamR568UK
50,Under utilized treasure,Awesome collection of 14th to 20th century paintings with a not to miss collection of sculptures in the surrounding gardens.,GdV001
50,Unexpected Gem,"When our plans for the day fell through we decided to stop in here for a couple hours. It's not as large as some of the more well-known museums, but for its size the scope of work is magnificent. The collections hold Rodin, Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Degas, Raphael... the list is extensive and impressive. Our interests are more the 19th and 20th Century masters, so that's where we headed first, but we could have easily spent a much longer amount of time than we had if we'd been able to explore the vast Asian collection as well. (The museum was closing by the time we made our way down to the Asian gallery.) I would highly recommend the Norton Simon for a very pleasant afternoon of beautiful, worldly art.",Elizabeth T
50,Almost as good as the Frick,"One of the very best small personal collections on earth. One assumes that Frick's collection was collected for him by ""advisors"" with his approval. But Norton Simon was a true connoisseur himself, and his taste was absolutely superb, as good as any private collector's has ever been. Plus the paintings are in incredibly good condition, and the Southern Asian sculptures downstairs are worth a couple of hours all by themselves. One of the temples of world art for the discriminating. And never crowded, with a lovely garden and cafe for dessert. One of my favorite places in America.",FWhiteIII
20,Paintings Without Condoms,"Over the past dozen or so years I have found this museum less and less of an attraction. They have some great work, of course. It seems, though, that every time I visited, they had put more paintings under protective glass or plastic. There must be a way of doing so without having to try to see art through reflections on the plastic. There surely could be designed a way of lighting the galleries that wouldn't reflect. Is there such a specialty as Museum Lighting Designer? I still wouldn't want the intermediary of a sheet of plastic interrupting my experience of the work. An insurance thing I guess. Most if not all of the other big museums in town have plenty of art that isn't under plastic or glass. If your LA museum-going time is limited, I'd go to one of those.",Thomas_Heasley
50,"For a great art experience and beauty, put this on your list","This relatively small museum is a delight. There are wonderful examples of world renown artists from many periods, cultures, and continents. What makes it so pleasant is not only the scale and collections, but the space is easy to walk around, each room has a bench for viewing, the art is well-lit with user-friendly and interesting details to read about each painting. The sculpture garden is filled with fascinating sculptures , a beautiful landscaped pond and tables and chairs for cafe food and drink. The only improvement to be made on the experience is the cafe: while the food and drink entries are suitable, there is an embarrassing void in the service that does not come close to meeting the high standards of the museum.",Caroltod
50,Amazing or only $9!,"Three couples made an afternoon visit to the Norton Simon for the first time recently. We had visited museums in Rome, Florence, Vienna, New York, etc. on several occasions. This is a wonderful museum with outstanding paintings from several periods and including major artists and their works. The museum layout is very compact for the volume of works shown. It is very easy to navigate. Parking is excellent. This is a must for museum lovers!",David B
50,You'll be amazed,"This gem contains some extraordinary art. You will see numerous Impressionist and modern paintings and other words and often exclaim, ""That's here?"" The lower level has an amazing collection of Asian and Southeast Asian art, beautifully displayed even if you don't fully understand some of the cultural nuances. And the outdoor gardens are worth the visit alone.",TravelWarrior200
50,"Excellent, not overwhelming","Have visited several times. The quality and breadth of the collection is excellent.

The museum also has a large collection of Asian art.The garden was closed today due to previous heavy rain although disappointed sitting quietly in the quant cafe and observing the garden from afar was still worth it.If you are an avid art lover or just looking for something to do the Norton Simon Museum will not disappoint.

40,"If you love Edgar Degas, then you'll love the Norton Simon Museum","I walked through Old Pasadena hoping to do some unique boutique shopping....what a disappointment. For all the money and supposed appreciation for artistic endeavors, you'd think this tony community would support something other than all the usual Pottery Barn and H&M stores found at your local mall, but the Norton Simon Museum is a gem in the face of all that mediocrity. My favorites are the 20th century rooms and the bronze casts of all of Edgar Degas wax sculptures, especially Little Dancer: Aged Fourteen. And I especially love sitting in the Sculpture Garden. I'm sorry I didn't give more time to exploring the Asian art.",AnnaLapid
50,Unique Exhibition of Art Collections,"This place exceeded my expectation with an unique set of art works, mainly from Europe and South East Asia. We were fortunate to visit the theater for a 30 minutes short film intro on Mr. Simon's background and his motivation for collecting such large set of arts. For me, especially the Indian, Pakistan, Tamil, Cambodian and Indonesian collections were the highlights as I've never really seen them previously. The sculpture garden in the back was pretty neat also and a good photo opportunity, as well the Rodin's work in the front.Overall a great place to visit for couple of hours. Afterwards, you can walk over (10min) to the Old Town Pasadena for some coffee/tea and people watch.",toga1k
50,World Class Art,"Norton Simon is a fantastic museum, although it is not large it has an incredible amount of first class artwork that will satisfy anyone's taste.

Once you see it you will be back soon to share it with a friend.",Allan S
50,What an eye Norton Simon had!,"I recently visited four L.A. art museums in four days. Although it's the least well known of the four, the Norton Simon was by far my favorite. It includes Western painting from medieval times to contemporary, and every painting on display was a gem, well worth contemplating. Moreover, the museum is small enough that you can easily see all the works on display within a few hours. Unlike some of the other L.A. collectors, Simon didn't just collect the showy and opulent. You will find a good mix of well known and lesser known artists.",OnALark_1
50,A wonderful day!,"Alone, with a friend, taking a field trip, or on a day date, the Norton Simon a Museum is a beautiful, relaxing, and delightful place to see art and gardens, and to have a delightful lunch at the outdoor patio cafe. It is not insanely crowded, parking is free, and the depth and breadth of the collections exhibited is amazing. There is something for everyone.",KAfromWH
50,A people's collection!,"Norton Simon was a very interesting man and he put together a very accessible art collection. This man made himself a great deal of money and he started with toilet paper and tomatoes! It should not come as any surprise then, to learn that he did not want to know just what art curators thought of a piece but what the janitor in his building thought of it too. I like this about Norton Simon. I love his Western art collection but it is when he fell in love with Asian art that the collection gets really exciting!The Museum is smaller than many others but it is not that often that you get so many of the truly sublime artists all together in one house. There are few rules to follow like putting up your bags and coats so that none of the paintings can get hit, but you are allowed to take pictures and there are so many representational pieces of the greats that you might have to recharge your batteries before you hit the Asian stuff downstairs! I learn new things each time I go there and hope you will too.",deabs8

If you are lucky you may see the fabulous collection of the Pasadena Museum of Art, a prescient group which collected early contemporary art. The garden is fabulous.

Alovely day.",Bj L
30,Great Art but that's it,"I've been to the museum long ago when I was a teen. This time, my sister and I decided to see it. The art was very nice. Some pieces by well known artists like Degas, and Van Gogh. I understand that a museum should be quiet but the atmosphere made me feel unwelcome. There attendants dressed in gray and black everywhere to tell you what not to do in the museum. They watch everyone like we're criminals not guests. They had rules like no food in museum, no cell phone talking or ringing, no umbrellas (it was raining that day). Such rules are understandable. They had a coat check room so we were able to check in our jackets and umbrellas. My sister had a small backpack purse. She was told to wear it on one shoulder or check it into the coat room. Why? It's close to the body and ergonomically more comfortable. If you come with a large purse or backpack you have to check it in. This place is not kid friendly. We did not have kids with us but those families that did were especially watched by staff. One family was taking pictures and the kids got too close to a wall. An employee swooped down swiftly to tell them to stay so far from the wall. If you need a snack, there is one cafe and it is outside with patio seating. It was pouring rain the day we went. There were 3 tables under the overhang and the rest were in the rain. They should put up a temporary tent cover for tables since you can't eat inside the building. My sister and I ate on a long skinny piece of granite as there were no available tables. Price of food high. I bought a turkey sandwich, hot tea, and a Chai coffee for 30$. I advise to eat before you go to see this place. Didn't feel like I could enjoy and appreciate the art in this place. Now that we have seen it, we never have to go back. On a positive note, do get the audio tour handsets, it's 3$ each person, but it helped the experience.",Pamela S
50,Best small art museum in LA,"I've visited the Norton Simon many times over the past twenty years and never tire of it. Although smaller than other art museums in Los Angeles, the collection is quite spectacular and well-curated. It includes examples of European art dating back to the 14th Century, with works by artists like Titian, Botticelli, Rubens and Rembrandt. They have a fine collection of paintings and sculpture from the 19th and 20th century, particularly works by Degas. It's hard to think of a significant artist who isn't represented in the collection. There is also a wing dedicated to Asian art as well as a print and photography collection. If you need a break, wander into their outdoor sculpture garden, a charming oasis complete with a small cafe that serves reasonably priced refreshments.",wego2places
50,We had been away too long,"This is a superb Museum, a rich and varied collection put together by Mr. Simon over the years. There is much to much to see, even in a day. We chose to look at the 19th and 20th Century collections. The collection includes all the Impressionists that you would expect to find; an excellent collection of Degas's work (probably equaling those in France). The Sculture Garden is home to the finest collection of Henry Moore's work we have seen other than the one in Hakone, Japan and in the Henry Moore Institute's collection.",PeterandJinx
50,One of the Best Ever,"This man collected some of the finest art ever. The diversity of his collection is amazing, from Van Gogh to Picasso, Degas and others makes this one of the best art museums I have encountered.

50,Unique and first class art collection,"What a surprise to find this incredible art collection in Pasadena. Norton collected stellar and unique paintings executed by contemporary artists. Who knew that Monet painted a realistic painting of a turbulent sea studded with sailboats at 24 years?There are fantastic Van Gighs and Renoirs, bombards, Degas etc. The sculpture garden is beautiful and the Asian art collection is outstanding.Skip the film about Mr. Norton Simon- it's uninformative.",utterna
50,The best little museum you don't know of,"The Norton Simon Museum is one of the best museums I've ever been to! It's the perfect size to take in for an afternoon (or Friday Evening) with the perfect amount of various art throughout history. The best part is they have a little bit of everything and you won't get burned out on seeing a lot of the same thing. Firstly, NSM has one of the largest collections of Edgar Degas paintings and sculptures in the world, which they display wonderfully. Early European art from the 14th century on - including impressive pieces from Botticelli, Raphael, El Greco through to the 19th century with impressive work by the big guns - Renoir, Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne. Modern and contemporary art perfectly represented by the likes of Picasso, Rauschenberg, and one of my most favorite sculptures by Giacometti. Downstairs you'll find an impressive collection of Asian art and artifacts after being greeted by a large Buddha looking in at you from the garden. The temporary exhibits are also held downstairs. The Garden outdoors is beautifully kept and holds some great modern sculptures, a perfect place to relax your overly stimulated eyes after touring the galleries. Pasadena California isn't just for football games and shopping - this is one of it's greatest treasures!",NikiMustTravel
50,Amazing collection,"We walked from our hotel to the Norton Simon in pouring rain. No big deal -- although I admit that it was raining harder than I thought it was when we started out. We mis-read the opening hour, so we arrived about 45 minutes early in cold, pouring rain. There were at least four guards standing around inside chatting amongst themselves, but they weren't about to open the doors a few minutes early so we could wait for opening indoors where it might have been a bit warmer. No big deal, but seemed heartless at the time. Once inside, all cares were forgotten because the place is awesome and the collection comparable to some of the nicest museums in the world. We had planned to spend much of the day -- breaking only for a quick, light lunch at the mid-point -- but the cafe is essentially outdoors and due to the rain (see above) not plausible. We'll be back -- in dry weather!",SPINDOCDENVER

Overall, it's an extremely well-curated collection, with art dating to the 15th century and sculpture even further back. Most of the art is Western, but there's some Asian sculpture, too.

Make a plan to arrive just before it opens so that you can check out the many sculptures that are on the grounds. They do have a nice collection from Rodin. The museum is nicely organized and easy to get around. They have an impressive amount of Impressionists. The Degas collection alone was fabulous. We had enjoyed their cafe with their reasonable selection of sandwiches, sweets and drinks. We sat outside on their patio and enjoyed their pond and vegetation.

Generally speaking, it's also cheaper than LACMA, and you won't have to deal with crowds.

40,Beautiful museum,The Norton Simon museum is an art museum in Pasadena with vast collections of Asian and European sculptures and paintings. Not only is the museum beautifully curated but also had wonderful lighting. The tastefully manicured garden has eclectic bronze sculptures too.,Monkeyed
50,Asian and European from 14C to Modern and Contemporary Art,"Norton Simon enjoyed extraordinary success as a businessperson. His collection found a home in Pasadena in 1970's. This museum is tremendously collection of both European and Asian masterpieces of arts. There is a sculpture garden and cafe. Outside seats are available. A big building inside are decided 14-16th century, 17th &18th century, 19th century, and 20th century areas. South and southeast Asian properties are located in lower level. Permanent displays are holding from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Tibet, Cambodia, and Thailand. Entrance fee: 12USD",shopping74
50,"Compact, Special and Interesting","This museum contains the personal collection of Norton Simon (the founder) along with other works from a NYC gallery, which he purchased years ago. It focuses on European Art from most periods; with a good selection from those periods. But what really merits a visit, is when there are special exhibitions. These are usually excellent exhibits focused on specific art styles, artists or aspects of art history. Right now (Dec. 2015) there are special exhibits pertaining to art as it relates to travel, and how newly-discovered processes to produce certain shades of blue oil paint came to influence art in the 1800s. All very interesting; you learn a lot. The museum is large enough to include much, but not so big that you feel tired and dizzy after an hour. It's a manageable museum to visit, even with children.",TheBrasilian
50,One of our favorite museums,"Norton Simon is just a very comfortable museum with a great staff, great programs, and a wonderful collection. Small enough that you can get through it in a reasonable period of time but with such a great collection that you can also spend as much time as you want just contemplating specific pieces if you choose. The docent lectures and tours are also consistently excellent. A really nice collection of impressionist and post-impressionist paintings if that is your thing, with my only regret being that I wish they had a better selection from Matisse (they only have one and it's not one of my favorites).",jr1962
40,Great small museum,"Norton Simon doesn't get the spotlight of other institutions, but this is a great little museum. Easy parking, great paintings and sculptures. Even if you don't like art, you can do a quick stop here and go to brunch or Old Town Pasadena shopping with your art loving friends.",Kenpasadena
50,Wonderful collection and location.,"Wonderful collection and location. Complete enough to be spectacular, but not so big that you just can't take it all in during a half day visit...Diverse collection but a real Gem for Pasadena and there is Parking too..Well worth the time..",Aston B
40,An Exceptional Collection in an Intimate Setting,"The Norton Simon Museum is a jewel, containing a wonderful collection of Impressionist and Modern Art together with a lovely sculpture garden and, importantly, a beautiful collection if Indian classical art, including stunned my sculpture from a number of classical periods in Indian art. Worth the detour! Sit and meditate in the garden.",Robert C
50,Excellent museum,"Even before you enter the museum, you get a hint that this is going to be pretty good. The collection of bronzes outside include works by Rodin. Very impressive!Inside, the gallery is well organised and the collection of works by well known and lesser known artists is very impressive. I was particularly impressed with the sculptures by Degas who, in my ignorance, I had thought of solely as a painter!As noted elsewhere, there is a strong collection of Dutch painters and quite a lot of religious art, which isn't really my cup of tea. Nonetheless they are impressive works, even if the subject matter is a bit creepy at times!The Asian art gallery downstairs was also impressive, as well as two special collections whose existence was sort-of advertised, but are also very interesting. The first was a series of travel sketches (perhaps selling them short) by Fragonard, completed during a Grand Tour back in the day. The second was a display about the introduction of some new colours to the artists palette, specifically cobalt blue, synthetic ultramarine and Prussian blue. Really interesting and some of the examples demonstrating the use of these colours were terrific. The ""Portrait of Theresa, Countess Kinsky"" is spectacular, along with a painting(!) by Degas whose title I forget.Highly recommended.",Andrew R
50,A collection assembled with love,"We have visited the Norton Simon three times now. It offers a well rounded collection of European art, laid out in a logical way that makes visiting, for a short time or a full day, easy and comfortable. We wished docent tours had been available, but the audio guide is good -- though many of my personal favorites aren't discussed on the guide.",Botticelli1105
50,One of the best alternatives to the Getty for art masterpieces,"We love going to the Norton Simon. I wouldn't suggest it much for kids because you would have to keep quieting them up or restraining them but it's good from like 10+. Nonetheless, my wife and I love just perusing the halls and admiring the different masterpieces of different time eras and in different styles. Perfect for date night or for art appreciation.",MrBalan
50,Wish we had more time!,"Wonderful outside and in. It was a little chilly for visiting the sculpture garden in the back, but so lovely, it should not be missed. The variety of the eclectic art inside was surprising. We ran out of time before we finished the first floor galleries. Certainly worth the admission fee.",Margaret W
50,Unexpectedly Wonderful,"After dismissing it for years to see bigger museums, like the Getty, I was really impressed with the Simon Norton in Pasadena. I went to see the Van Gough's but they have Monet, Picasso, Renoir, Rembrandt, and a fantastic collection of Hindu Art.Thinking the kids would be more into sculptures, I asked an elderly greeter if there were any and where? He said there were ""some"" scattered through out. Man, he really understand the sculptures. There are a lot of them and they are very cool. Especially in the Hindu exhibit.An inadvertent ""art lesson"" for the kids came up when they saw some very plain paintings, looking like it was made with a roller brush and one color, and asked ""This is art?"" LOL - ""Yes kids. Find you ""Voice"" and create art for yourself and yes, there could be a market or museum for it."" - Unsaid Translation: I agree it's sort of crappy looking, so you should be encouraged if you decide to be a painter.There is a ""Drawing Like Fragonard"" room with a few paintings and sculptures for people to sketch. They provide paper, pencils and large clip boards. I was surprised that my kids sat for so long, over 20 minutes, and completed a sketch of a sculpture by Roccataglita.One can picnic out front before the entrance, but can not bring food inside to get to the pond area. The duck pond is very nice with interesting trees and sculptures.Kids (under 18) / Students (with I.D.) Free - Seniors (over 62) $9 - Adults $12 - Free ParkingAdmission is FREE the First Friday of every month from 5 - 8 pm. But check first for any changes or special events.",Bentheredunthat
50,Good flow,I always like a museum that has a good flow to it- one that you can see the progression of different subjects and how they relate. Norton Simon is one of those and we always enjoy our visits there.,Dieselthis
50,Remarkable Museum,"As a serious art museum hound I was amazed that I'd never heard of this little gem. A Rembrandt self portrait?! Many excellent still lifes, including Claesz van Heda, my favorite. I think the strength is really 17th c. Dutch, but there's a lot more. I never even got to the Asian art downstairs.",Ken A
50,"Love this place, a great and well run museum.","Have been here many times, they always have great exhibits and featured shows. The collection of Hindu and Indian art is excellent.",1jjarecki
50,Just Not Enough Time,"We foolishly thought that we could spend half a day and see most of the museum. Wrong! I feel like we barely glimpsed the bottom floor before we had to leave for a previous engagement.There is a reason this museum is considered one of the finest in Los Angeles. As wonderful as the paintings are, the religious statutes are truly a treasure.On the day we were there (a Friday) it was not crowded, not overrun by schoolchildren and not too stuffy from the docents constantly looking over your shoulder. We will certainly be back to visit some of the other exhibits in more detail.",KenVicLee
40,Perfect Size Museum,"They have a wonderful permanent collection, some interesting changing exhibitions and a nice garden. Cafe could notch it up a bit.",MoxieBoston
30,"""Comfortable size""","The museum can be enjoyed in an afternoon. It is not overwhelming. Some of the art is really special and some not. Their is a gift shop, garden, tables and food to purchase. Worth a look.",epuya
50,We left wanting to return soon!,"WOW. A museum in Pasedena, collection of Norton Simon who loved the Impressionists, Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Cezanne, and others too numerous to mention. Also a great number of 17 and 18th century art. I spent so much time viewing the paintings I didn't see the Asian collection downstairs. The sculpture garden was exquisite. Unusual plants and trees and beautiful sculpture. Small outdoor cafe. Definitely will visit again!",prettywoman65
20,Arrogant Attitude Towards Wheelchair Bound Patron,"I am reposting this because I am so angry. I don't know if this happened because the person who ""represented"" the Norton Simon museum was racist (I am white, my husband black.), classist (I was wearing a sweatshirt and jeans.), or had a problem with handicapped people. It was totally obnoxious, no matter what the motivation.My husband and I went to the Norton Simon museum in Pasadena. We paid $24 admission, and saw some lovely art. At the end of the day, he needed to use the bathroom. I asked a guard if there were a family-friendly restroom, or a dedicated handicapped restroom. She said, no, but I could help him into the men's room.First of all, no one in a wheelchair could have gotten into the men's room without someone to help with the door. Secondly, he checked to see if there was someone at the urinal. There was one man outside of a stall, washing his hands. I helped him in, and into the handicapped stall, and ran into no one else.Until we exited the restroom, and a man in a suit ran up to us, and berated me for going into the men's room. I explained to him that I had asked, and was told it was o.k. He said, ""Who told you that? I needed to know, so we can make sure the way is clear."" I told him I HAD asked a guard, and he said, ""Well a customer complained.""My husband and I weren't customers? I told him I was sorry his ""customers"" had a problem with handicapped people--but we HAD asked. I thought it would shame him, and he'd leave us alone. We were leaving, but he kept chasing after us, explaining his position, even after I said, ""O.K., got it, now we know.""I had to wheel my husband down a ramp and through a parking lot to get to the lower handicapped parking level because this officious official made our last 5 minutes so unpleasant, there was no time to find the elevator that would have gotten him down to that area safely.Norton Simon made his money from Hunt-Wesson Foods, McCall’s Publishing, Saturday Review of Literature, Canada Dry Corporation, Max Factor cosmetics, and Avis Car Rental.The museum can't afford a handicapped restroom??? Or at least sensitivity training towards people who are differently-abled?",Karen M
50,Gem of a museum,Worth seeing anytime you happen to be in Pasadena. Broad and impressive collection. Especially the sculpture garden,BobLJ
40,"Beautiful small museum, great Asian Art collection and nice small cafe","We ended up at the Norton Simon museum by accident, when we came to Pasadena for the first time to see the Rose Bowl Parade on Colorado Blvd. Small museum with an extensive collection of sculptures and Asian Art. I personally liked the Rodin sculpture from the Ballerinas series. They have a beautiful courtyard with a small pond with Lilies and Papyrus, we enjoyed a nice cup of coffee while enjoying the surroundings. There's a small path in the garden with, what I think are, Benjamin Moore sculptures. We were a group, so it made more sense for us to become members than to pay for the individual entrance fees.",Cristina S
50,Surprisingly Good!,"You may have heard that this is a good collection; you just won't believe how good until you see it. Most of us know a few ""big"" names in art, and it's always fun to see those names ""live."" At the Norton Simon, that's exactly what will happen. Walking in, my friend paused to ask me if I wanted a map. ""I see Van Gogh!"" I said. And I just kept walking, too excited to wait. We were fortunate to be there on the first Friday of the month when the museum is free from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm. The crowd was upbeat and diverse, couples on dates, parents obviously just home from work with kids, hopeful singles. It was a fun time to be in an art museum. Parking was a little tough. The lot fills up fast, but after 6:00 spaces open up.",Michelle B
50,Degas!,"I've been to this museum a few times. The last time was last Friday. The first Friday of the month is free from 5 pm - closing. I love taking advantage of free entrance. But it's also worthwhile to pay the $12.50 entrance fee. Parking is free but can be difficult on the free Fridays.My favorite is Norton Simon's collection of Edgar Degas' sculptures and Rembrandt. You'll also find pieces of artwork by some of Rembrandt's students. I'm a business analyst, not an art expert so to my untrained eyes, I could not differentiate which one is Rembrandt's and which one is his student's work.The museum also has a wide collection of Asian art and a lovely garden. I did not visit the garden last week though because by the time I got to the museum, it's already 6 pm and it's dark in the garden. But that garden is a must see.",Maria A
50,great small museum with strong collection of impressionists,"this is is a fairly small art museum with a strong collection of impressionists and earlier eupoean paintings that many big city museums would envy. it includes paintings by picasso, van gogh, manet, monet, and emough degas paintings, pastels and sculptures to have a degas yard sale - overall a surprising small art muesum close to the pleasant arroyo terrace and gamble house",RStokes
50,favorite art museum in CA,"many pieces of art, mainly paintings to view. easy location to visit with free parking. we enjoy it most because of the volume compared to others",Jon
40,Great small focused collection,"We saw only part of the collection, focusing mostly on 19th and 20th century. A large number of Degas's works--sculpture and paintings, some very nice Van Goghs, and Picassos. Well-done audio tour added a lot to the experience. They also had a collection of Asian sculpture that I'd like to return to see. Lunch in the sculpture garden is quite relaxing.",JDSC319
40,"Lovely, Small Teaching Museum","This museum was so well organized, with a clear travel path. Its architecture was perfect for the works it displayed.My favorite aspect was the display cases that contained clearly written explanations of techniques and history.The sculpture garden out back has a path that allows visitors to stroll around a small pond.Make sure you eat something before you go.",H E
50,Art Haven,"This is my most favorite out of all metropolitan museums in Los Angeles.Five reasons for five stars:1) The most exquisite collections of Van Gogh, Edgar Degas, and Henry Moore. I'm a big fan of impressionism. My heartbeats stop when I get in front of Van Gogh's Mulberry Tree.2) Clever architectural design and layout. You can finish walking the entire gallery and garden in 10 to 15 minutes. The limited space holds so many precious master pieces and interesting landscape. While not an inch of space is wasted, it does not feel compressed or congested.3) Civil and friendly staff. At some metropolitan museums you constantly get the ""look"" when trying to see paintings closely, as if you are about to raise the security alert. This is not the case here.4) Reasonable admission: $10 for adults (LACMA is @ $15) and free for kids and students.5) Free parking.",GlobalYoginista
50,Best LA museum!,I just love this place. It has gorgeous art both inside and in the sculpture garden. It is just the right size so that you can enjoy the art and get overwhelmed. The gift shop is a gem. Don't miss it if you are in the area.,Roberta5261
50,Impressive Impressionists!,"This used to be the old Pasadena Gallery until it combined with the Simon Norton collection. We focused on the impressionist and post impressionist sections that had a great collection including art and sculpture by Degas, Monet, Picasso among many. It is a very impressive collection especially for a local gallery. We also liked the casts by Rodin in the gardens. Well worth the trip to Pasadena.",Sydneysida

50,A Gem of a Collection,"Norton Simon's collection is just wonderful ! It rivals any museum and it is beautifully displayed. In particular the South Asian collection downstairs is amazing. My particular favorite thing to do is go on first Fridays 5 - 8 pm when it is free entrance and sketch in the various galleries. A sketch meetup, Freehand Sketching in Pasadena and L.A., often does this.",Sheri S
50,Surprised By Its Excellence,"An amazing art collection, very well displayed and all in all just a wonderful experience. We knew the collection had some masterpieces, but were floored by how many wonderful paintings by some of the top names.

50,Excellent Art Museum,"After watching the Rose Parade most of my life on New Years Day, I have always wanted to go thru the Norton Simeon Museum. While staying in Pasadena, we took a morning to go. Free parking. The grounds are beautiful with Rodin bronzes. The museum is a modern smaller building, mostly on one floor. Courtyard with gardens, pond, and more sculptures. Fabulous European masters paintings, many Impressionists such as Van Gogh, Monet, Picasso ,as well as Rembrandt , Renoir , Degas, and hundreds of others. We went through it in a couple of hours.

50,"Rembrandt, Rubens, Cezanne, Manet, Monet, Picasso, Degas, Rodin, Moore.... Need I say more!","This museum is a good one to visit f you are with those who can't be in a museum for a whole day. I believe 2 to 3 hours will give you enough coverage. Trust me, bringing 2 teenage boys whose idea of an art museum is not really a ""fun"" thing to do... this is a perfect spot.If you love art museums, this is perfect as well. Within a span of 2 hours, you can be up close and personal with excellent art work from the masters. Without the throngs and throngs of people you would see in the Louvre, for example. Hence, you can take the time to sit and enjoy. There are in general two floors. The bottom portion had Southeast Asian artwork, while the top floor has European art pieces.It also has an outside garden, great spot to have some coffee or snacks. Beautiful garden with big statues by Moore. They also have pieces of Rodin and Degas (not in the garden). The teenagers hang out in this area and enjoyed it.Once you are done here, then take the short drive to old town Pasadena and have dinner, explore, etc. So if you are in Pasadena, take the time to come here as well. Adults are $12/each, 18 and under free. Students with ID free as well. So a perfect price to see the art masters.Would definitely recommend!",rrkkjones

50,You Can't Go Wrong with this Museum,"I always recommend that people visit the Norton Simon when coming to visit Los Angeles and/or Pasadena. There is an assortment of art and styles presented, but not overwhelming to the point that you feel the need to leave after a short time inside. The surroundings are not as institutional-feeling as some museums and galleries give off, which is refreshing, because the environment complements the art, not drastically contrasts from it. It's a wonderful date spot, as well as for families. Just be sure that you don't bring water inside, you will have to give it to an employee to dispose of it. But that's standard for art museums, I think. Have a great time!",marybelle08

I have reviewed shows here and did a feature on sdwoodruff.WordPress on the recently returned (and originally looted) Cambodian Temple Wrestler sculpture. Fine garden with sculptures and a lilly pond. Frequently rotating exhibitions and excellent Indian sculptures, mostly looted in the 19th century. The gallery has artistically shadowed lighting. Renaissance classics, impressionists, Picasso and others. Not expensive and a $9 senior entrance fee. Outdoor front court loaded with an impressive forest of Rodins.",Pacodawg
40,Comfortable atmosphere - nice collection,"Plenty of parking and reasonable admission prices (kids are free) made this an interesting choice for a summer afternoon. The museum was very comfortable and never felt crowded. I took my 12 year old son here in order to expose him to the arts. My hopes of getting him interested were dashed as he quickly tired of seeing so many paintings of ""weird looking people"". Nonetheless, I enjoyed the breadth of the museum's collection. The Rembrandts and the Van Goghs were particularly appealing. The museum is pretty heavily weighted with the Impressionists - particularly Degas. I'm not a huge fan but if you are, you will be delighted. I understand the gardens are nice too but my son wanted to leave so didn't get to those.

The food and drinks are healthy and very good. They also show a movie which tells the story of Norton Simon and his collection. Make sure to read the info next to each painting, very informative.",ponsie2015

50,Outstanding collection in beautiful setting and facility,"This is a great local museum located in the western part of Pasadena.The museum features an amazing collection of Degas, Rodin, Henry Moore and other similar artists. The Impressionist collection is very good and the sculpture garden is excellent. The garden features some interesting and unusual vegetation as well, all well-maintained.We found the curator's information to be consistently excellent as well.Audio curator's comments were available, but we chose to pass given that we had all day to visit.During our visit, a special exhibit focused on the development of the color blue in art over the centuries. Very well done.Don't miss Rodin's Thinker, which is on the front of the Museum. It's not obvious how you get to it - we asked one of the staff when we saw it in the brochure. You simply walk on the lawn around the building.",Lyle B

As always, enjoyed our time in the museum and learned something fascinating painlessly.",laurelhurst56
50,Top of my list!,"I have visited the Norton Simon probably 3 times in 20 years. After my August visit, I want to return annually. It is just great! From the impeccably laid out and cared for grounds, which begin at the street and parking areas, to the sensational sculpture garden courtyard, the use of trees and plantings and water is wonderful. The collection's main stream is European from 14th to early 20th. The collection on display is large enough to be deep and wide, but not so large but what you can plan to visit most everything in a day. The Asian collection is excellent and well focussed. Modern art is not covered well enough to be a contender. Do not plan to zip through in an hour. Whether you read the excellent text next to each work, or listen to the super recorded commentary, expect to spend more than 2 hours even if you take some shortcuts. The store offers high quality, matted digital prints at moderate cost - I think of virtually anything in the collection. On-line they offer archival quality scans of their collection, and by offering high resolution download, it puts them far out in front of the others. It is incredibly generous.",Fringe_Gatherer

Collections include Asian, European, Modern, and Contemporary.My visit was before Sept., 2014, but that is the earliest time available for me to check.",Granna2012
50,A little of everything,"Great museum, not too big so it won't take you hours to see everything, has a lot of big named pieces too. There is an outdoor cafe, smallish, compared to the one at the Huntington, but there is a nice little garden you can eat outside in as well.",Varesha108
50,Very interesting and beautiful,This is an indoor/outdoor museum and can be done in one trip. There is a great cafe in the garden to get a light lunch.,Michele K
50,Boutique museum worth a journey,"beautiful inside and out. A really diverse and wonderfully displayed collection. Airy rooms, very special pieces, don't miss Degas collection",Watersprite91
50,Great Museum with big name collections,"When you go to Pasadena, one of the must do's, is to take a couple hours to go to the Norton Simon. One does not expect to find such a beautiful museum with such a great permanent collection of Masters. Everyone I have ever taken there is delightfully surprised.",Swisscss
50,What a gem!,"I had a little free time while in Pasadena for a conference so spent a couple of hours in the Norton Simon museum. What a great choice! The museum is relatively small so you can see it mostly in a couple of hours without your head exploding (which is what I often feel like at really big museums). I didn’t know anything about the museum when I went in so had no expectations, but was very pleasantly surprised. The museum has a small but excellent collection spanning the past 500 years. Each section had representatives of the major masters of the time so it was a whole art history course in the span of a couple of hours. The emphasis was mainly on continental western Europe – mainly from the Netherlands through Italy with almost nothing from Britain or eastern Europe. The first section was on mostly religious art from the 1300s-1500s and included many of the major styles and representatives of artists I have seen from Europe including Botticelli, Raphael and El Greco. The next section on European art from the 1600s and 1700s included representative paintings by Rubens, Rembrandt and Canaletto, among others. The next section on art from the 1800s apparently is the largest collection of impressionist and post-impressionist art in southern California and I would believe it. All of the major artists are represented including Monet, Renoir, Cesanne, over 100 painting by Degas and at least three or four that I saw by Van Gogh. Truly an excellent collection and a great way to see representative paintings by many famous artists in a small space. There also was a gallery of modern art that I could not relate to very well but seemed to be good. Downstairs there was a collection of Asian sculpture, mostly from Thailand, Burma and India, and there was an outside sculpture garden that included Asian art as well as contemporary pieces and bronzes by Rodin. The exhibition on blue pigment was very interesting. Truly a gem and just a short walk from Old Pasadena.",Stephen G
50,Great curated pieces from the Masters....,One of my favorite museums with a lovely permanent collection from Monet to Degas. Small museum but worth the time. Beautifully curated and first Friday of the month is always free.,venicegirl05
40,All the works were beautiful of course,Very beautiful museum that you can walk through and not be rushed. Quiet atmosphere. Wonderful art collections they also have a garden setting where you can order coffee or tea and snacks. Some days are free to enter. Parking is free and it is easy access off the freeway. Should be a definite visit,Rosemarie H
50,A stunning Museum,"The Norton Simon collection features many period works, including some Van Goghs and other impressionists. The Grounds are also lovely, incorporating a sculpture garden well worth the walk.",Mary M
50,Fabulous Museum on beautiful grounds.,The Norton Simon Museum was marvelous. It was difficult to tearmyself away from the exhibits and go on to others which were also difficult to leave behind.,mocheB20A
50,A Great Place For Art,Beautiful buildings and grounds. Nice cafe too. The museum had a good selection of art objects and was very well arranged. Easy to see each item.,mgsinger
50,Not to be missed,An excellent collection of Impressionist paintings. Especially strong Degas offerings. There are also some 17th masters such as Rembrandt. There is an amazingly strong collection of South and Southeast Asian art as well. Also some great Moore sculptures in the garden.,lislander
50,Worth the trip. Excellent contemporary exhibits with some Euro masters thrown in,Best part was excellent descriptions of art on the wall. Easy to read and enjoyable. Whatever team wrote them had a good sense of humor too. The sculpture garden was very enjoyable as well. Not a long walk from Old Town Pasadena where there are many restaurants.,lakemary1204
50,Do NOT miss!,"Absolutely world-class in every way. My favorite periods happen to be the old masters and the impressionists and choice exemplars appear here in a beautiful space. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was surprisingly uncrowded, another plus. The food at the outdoor cafe is surprisingly good and it's a delightful place to rest before you move on to the rest of the museum.",Consumerista
50,Second visit,This museum is a must-see if visiting Pasadena. We spent four hours looking at the special exhibition and walking around the garden with its water feature and lovely statues.,HolidayOrganiser
50,A spectacular museum,"This is an outstanding museum with a comprehensive display of art. I saw many famous pieces that I had only previously seen in books or on TV. Quite a treat. (The museum cafe, however, was awful!)",Elon B
50,Great Variety,Nice blend of time periods from Renaissance to Contemporary art. The museum has a couple outdoor elements which balance the museum experience and allow for a nice setting to recharge.,JeffereWest
50,Great LA museum.,Love this museum!!!! It's overlooked and that means it wasn't very crowded on a Friday night. The collection is great and I love the sculpture gardens!,GivemeaTfortravel
50,First Rate,Lovely Saturday spot! Visited this weekend and so enjoyed the museum and sculpture garden. Even lunch in the garden was delightful. The Degas collection alone is worth the price of admission.,AcornFoodLady
40,Norton with kids,"We visited the Norton Simon on a weekday with out-of-town guests. Since we live close, it was more of an experiment to see how the children would do at a museum before dragging them around London. They (3 & 5) walked around and looked at the works of art for about an hour. They were more interested in the outside sculpture garden than the inside, which featured 3 famous pieces from France at the time. The museum itself is nice and it wasn't too crowded. Get there early for less crowds. Parking was free, which is nice for Pasadena. Don't forget to see the Mulberry Tree. You can almost see the paint drip off the canvas.",irsh21
50,The Best Big Little Museum,"Norton Simon has the best of the best, but not too much of any one thing. You get an overview of many styles, periods, and media but no room is huge, crowded or overwhelming. It's the perfect size to do in an hour or two, and you feel enriched and educated and cultured. The outdoor cafe is a lovely place to sit and enjoy tea or a meal, and the landscaping.",Suzanne S
50,Magnificently Minimal Museum,"This is a jewel-box art museum, one of the best in North America. A fine collection of Impressionists, European and American; a nice outdoor garden/cafe with simple lunch foods at a reasonable price; some great reproductions of their honored sculptor, Rodin. It's an easy art-feast at which to spend a couple of hours or more.",GrannieFrannie007
50,Great things come in small packages!,"This is not a large museum, but that is one of the things that makes it so appealing. It is well curated and the collections are laid out so that you can follow European art from about the 1500's forward. Each piece has a well detailed description of the art and artist - really puts each piece into perspective. The collection of French Impressionists is especially nice given the size of the museum and they do have quite a few Degas'. The Asia collection is downstairs and also quite impressive for its size. The garden courtyard is beautiful and a nice break from being indoors (you could easily spend many hours). Right now they also have a special exhibit on the technology and development of paint and how it affected the ways artists could paint - unusual and interesting! Even my husband (not a real art lover) enjoyed this exhibit. A lovely and relaxing way to spend an afternoon.",betterontheroad
50,Peaceful museum,"This is a small art museum, but often has special exhibits. It always feels peaceful to me. The parking is close and free. Admission is free the first Friday of the month from 5-8 PM",Bea M
50,Not so big but a great collection in it's area,"Primarily Degas, but a sensational collection of his work, as well as other work from the connected period of art in France [predominantly] as well as some contemporary stuff. Also the Rodin sculpture garden as you approach the front door is a treat.",Scott P
50,Asian Knockout Plus,"Even though the Norton Simon has returned 4 Khmer statues to Cambodia, their Asian collection is a knockout. An impressive Thai Buddha towers over and greets you in the entry. Inside on the lower level you'll find unique pieces primarily from South and Southeast Asia; hence, you can make vusual connections between these areas. Don't miss the outside sculpture area where you can see the rear of 5 (?) statues artistically arranged in recessed wndows. On the main level you can see a wealth of 19th and 20th century European and American pieces, visit the bookstore, or stroll around the pond and gardens populated with Henry Moore, Mayo and other sculptures. Enjoy a coffee, meal or snack in the outside garden cafe at one side of outdoor exhibit space -- the best eating spot that I've found in Southern Calif. that combines ambiance with art. The adjacent free parking lot fills up when their is a children's event, so check their activities calendar and plan your visit accordingly.",GlobalGypsy_13
50,How the other half lived surrounded by art,"The Norton Simon Museum is actually a house tour of a man who lived to be surrounded by art he appreciated. Some of the pieces are rare and wonderful, and the placement itself is a work of art, including several life size realistic sculptures by several artists. There is enough good and great art to make it as worth visiting as the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, and if you are an art lover, it will be well worth making the appointment and the interestingly demanding docent!",tortuga_gente
50,Good things come in small packages!,"One of the best smaller museums I have visited! Don’t miss this fantastic gem!Free parking. Outdoor cafe serves up delectable, fresh, California flavors. But go early because they can run out of some of the item choices. Choices include salads, sandwiches, kids meals, etc...Make time to see the movie featuring the history of the museum - quite fascinating. Lovely outdoor garden sculpture area and pond.Gift shop too!",luvplayacar
50,What a gem!!!,"I could kick myself for not visiting this place sooner. After all, I did live in the area for quite a few years. Beside their wonderful and rich art collections, the museum also offers classes for adult and children in a variety of art related topics. I especially love their garden. Although it's not a huge space, the garden has many old trees with artfully shaped branches and sculptures dotted throughout. They also have an outdoor cafe which serves light meals and beverages including beers and wines.Great place to bring kids on the weekend to enjoy a small cultural haven in Pasadena.",Trang F
50,A jewel box of a museum,This is a gem of museums. Norton Simon has collected wonderful fine art and spectacular Asian artifacts. It is beautifully displayed and there is a lovely garden to boot. The museum shop is one of my favorites and I LOVE museum gift shops.,mjlang1952
50,Great Museum to visit,"Visited Norton Simon Museum today - had a great time - wonderful paintings - actually surprised that they had so many by Degas, Picasso, Rubens, Renoir, Matisse, Monet, Manet....and the list goes on. Great sculpture garden. The museum wasn't crowded and so viewing was especially pleasant. They have a small cafe in the sculpture garden - good but not great.",kardex2dog
50,Fantastic art collection,"Great collection of fine art, and really enjoyed the way the museum was layed out by year/era. 1600s, 1800s, to more current etc. Gave a good sense of the change in art styles over the centuries.Thoroughly enjoyed the Asian art collection downstairs with the Buddhist, Hindu and other spiritual art and statues with some interesting points on the religions of the area.",Gary925
50,"Serenity in Pasadena, California","Sublime setting where Orange Grove Boulevard and Colorado Blvd. meet. Magnificent artwork, beautiful garden, lovely architecture. Perfect place to linger and enjoy.",Joe P
50,Great Modern art museum,A lot of room to walk around and a lot of interesting exhibits. I loved the sculptures outside. You will love this little museum.,Regina M
50,Fabulous art in Pasadena,The Norton Simon is just large enough to get through completely without feeling overwhelmed. The Impressionist art is my favorite section. It also has a great garden area with statues by various artists including Rodin.,pjn2lp
40,So Many Things to Love,"There are so many things to love about the Norton Simon Museum. First, the beautiful sculpture garden that surrounds the building is full of Rodin sculptures that present a very good representation of the quality to expect inside. The collections are beautiful, the facility is very spacious and set up to enjoy the artistic organically. Just wonderful.",Dawn D
50,Norton Simon Museum revelatory collection,"Extraordinary collection. Especially rich in Post-Impressionist art, from Van Gogh, Gauguin to Toulouse-Lautrec. Also great depth in Degas, and another entire wing with Old Master Paintings, several great Rembrands. Rich holdings of Southeast Asian sculpture on the lower floor, and great Rodin bronzes in the garden. Beautifully curated to bring out thematic ideas, and connections.",NANCY S
50,"Small, but can stand tall against the icons of Art Museums","I judge art museums on a single scale (unlike restaurants). So the Met, the Louvre, the Getty are the 5's. It's hard to compete with those. Even my favorite, Legion of Honor in SF I rate a 4. Norton Simon has a great collection, housed very nicely, good audio tour (with many different people doing narration), and everything is nicely organized. Two things lift this museum to a ""5"" for me. First, a gorgeous sculpture garden. It's the greatest pleasure I've ever experienced walking about an art museum (I was told to feel free to step on the lawn to see the pieces). You can also stop and enjoy a light meal and a beverage. The other thing, they have a casting of The Burghers of Calais. Way better than The Thinker.",TennisBum P
40,Treats for the eye,"At the Norton Simon there are gems you might not expect to find. Manet, Monet and Van Gogh are here. There is a really nice collection of impressionist paintings, and a little garden with sculptures by well-known modern masters;""The Burgers of Calais"" are at the entrance.If you like 18th Century large paintings of historical events , or earlier religious paintings, you will find good examples. In the basement are many statues, some very old, of Asian gods. There may be special exhibits.The Museum often has lectures and concerts, it would be good to inquire ahead.One thing I cannot recommend is the cafe. I have eaten there several times and was always disappointed. The hot food is frozen and reheated. The sandwiches are dry and overpriced. You have to purchase the water to go with those sandwiches!Parking is free but go early on weekends and special program days. The staff is friendly and helpful.",MARGARET L
40,A Lovely Day Out,"We visited the museum on Friday, June 19th, to view ""Arrangement in Gray & Black #1"" (Whistler's Mother)....The entrance fee is $12...... without the special exhibition: ""Tete a Tete"".It was a nice show w/ works by Toulouse Lautrec, Degas, & Van Gogh.... The Degas included a lovely charcoal, pastel & sculpture.... The Lautrec were painting, that I never knew of, as mostly one is shown his poster art.....The museum was clean & quiet.... the back rooms, however, were stuffy and warm.....The staff is very friendly & they have a lot of security. But do not ask the security people questions about the works of art, because for the most part, they do not have the knowledge to answer them.The Asian art is lacking, seriously mostly sculpture of male Deities.... but at the end of the gallery is a HUGE glass wall looking out onto a green space with large stone Buddha.The selection of Dutch/Flemish art is wonderful and was definitely the highlight of the visit..... The Rembrandt's are easily the highlight of the collection that is currently on display (which they rotate from their vast vaulted collection).There was one Diego Rivera on display which I liked as well as a Kandinsky!The sculpture garden is nice, but I was more interested in photographing the pond (which is in bloom) and dragonflies...The ""cafe"", is expensive, very expensive, but they offer wine & beer, as well as iced coffee.....The entrance fee is $12......",Auntie-Nanuuq
50,A Beautiful Museum,WOW! Incredible. The outside garden with all the sculptures on a sunny Pasadena day. One of the best museums in the world.,Prizefight17
50,stunning,"The sculpture garden is lovely. The lower level with statues placed in front of windows ,creating lovely tableaus, and the statues out front are all exceptional. I find their collection of impressionist paintings to be the best in Southern California museums.",Granny1957
50,Terrific museum,"Great art, well displayed with Good lighting. Fabulous sculpture garden. Easy to get to and park. Currently displaying works from Musee d'Orsay in Paris. Lots of Impessionist paintings.",RWL08540
50,Well worth LA traffic,"In a nutshell, terrific! At this posting there were paintings on loan from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris...Monet, Degas, Renoir, Manet and many more. The NS has many important pieces from the Dutch Masters, Reubens and Diego Rivera in its own collection.I should also mention the sculpture garden with a water lily pond. Very beautiful and tranquil and great to just rest tired feet and overwhelming amount of art information. There is a nicely placed cafe complete with sandwiches, snacks and beverages.Within a beautiful old section of Pasadena surrounded by old growth trees and the white noise of cars whizzing by the Norton Simon museum is a treasure!",KMcT1
50,"A So Cal favorite- Art lovers, run don't walk to get here.","This is by far my #1 spot to bring out of town visitors. World class collection. I've been coming here regularly for over 20 years. Sculpture garden is a lovely spot for photos. Don't miss the South Asian collection on the lower level. Although the museum feels small there is a lot to absorb and the collection rivals any fine museum in Europe or New York . Believe me I've been to most of the world's great museums and I'm proud to have this collection in LA.right down the freeway from home .Run don't walk to visit this stunning collection ,visitors and locals alike.",LMZ04
50,I will be Back,Nice art collection. Facility has accessibility for everyone. Staff are friendly. Museum is close to old town Padasena restaurants and more.Michael Dergar,MichaelDergar
50,"Lovely museum, with a very pleasant garden and a good collection of world class art","We were on a time limit (a little less than 2.5 hours) to go through the museum and garden, it was enough although we wouldn't mind another extra 30 to 45 min. I was surprised by how much art it had in what seemed like a relatively small building. Here are the things we liked:The beautiful garden with sculptures which wrapped around the museum.We could take pictures of the art work without flash.We visited during a very hot afternoon, it was very easy to reenter the museum from the garden.The renovation was designed by Frank Ghery, it brought natural light into the building and made a connection between the interior and outside.The cafe was part of the garden.There is an interesting collection of Asian sculpture and artifacts downstairs.When I was leaving, I was given a lovely print of Botticelli's Madonna and Child with Adoring Angel. We love visiting museums and have visited many around the world, this is the first time for me to receive a parting 'gift' from a museum. Needless to say, it is much appreciated.What we thought was a bit strange:Rodin's Thinker was placed on the side of the building, facing traffic.. with no pathway leading to it. We searched for it in the garden but couldn't see it, I don't think there is access from the garden or the museum to it. One could save this for last, if visiting in an afternoon, to see it after the museum closes.",PYPF
50,Always a treat for the spirits,"My favorite place to spend some relaxing time looking at an excellent collection of art, enjoying the gardens, and hanging out with friends without having to fly to Europe. A much nicer collection than the Getty, and Pasadena offers some great places to dine before or after.",Ben B
50,An Underrated Gem,"It may not be the biggest museum in Los Angeles County, but it may be one of its best. There is an immense collection of ancient Asian artifacts here. They also have several Picasso's and Degas' to go along with the ancient stuff. It really is a treat to see so much great art packed in a rather petite building.",USCarlos
50,Top Works of Art,This museum is a must see museum. They have the masters of art in this place. The real original masterpieces. And traveling shows of significant works.,PilotMichael
50,Astonishing!!,"Absolute must if you love art. I was baffled by the diversity and beauty of the masterpieces. From Renaissance to Modern Art, Canalletto to Henry Moore!!Inside and outside! Astonishing for a small private museum!",Chir C
50,Incredible art musuem - a MUST see,"If you can make it to Pasadena, the Norton Simon museum is absolutely a MUST SEE. It is one of the best curated museums I have experienced. The breadth and quality of the art is simply amazing, especially given its size.The Illinois Institute of Art in Chicago can match the quality, but it is 10 times larger and you need a week to see it. The Norton Simon is much smaller, and simply one amazing piece after another. A true walk through the history of masterful artists.The art is impeccably restored and preserved. Thus you see the art as it was seen when created, rather than the often-times dingy art of other museums. Everything simply ""comes to life"" quite spectacularly.On our visit they had a special exhibit which included Whistler's Mother (originally named ""Arrangement in Gray and Black #1 by Whistler, I learned.) Simply fantastic. Right up there at the top of some of the experiences an art fan would enjoy.I highly recommend this museum for those who enjoy art. From the neophyte who will learn from all the well written explanations to the expert this is a museum everyone can enjoy. And have a GREAT experience in just 1.5 to 3 hours, leaving you time for other things!Warning - be sure to check on-line for hours of operation. On our visit day it was only noon to 5:00. Be sure you know when you can get in so you plan your day accordingly.",Adam H
50,Wonderful Museum with World Class Collection,"Norton Simon was a very discerning private collector and now museum goers are the beneficiaries of his great eye and generosity. fantastic collection of 19th and early 20th Century European paintings, as well as an excellent Asian art collection on the bottom floor. When we visited in May they were showing some of the greatest pieces from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, including Whistler's Mother. A must see for art lovers.",davemh333
50,Great Collection!,"This is one of the best museums in Southern California. It boggles the mind that one man built this collection. It is a beautiful museum as well. The grounds are quite nice and there is a small restaurant with outdoor dining. If you give yourself the day, you can take in the whole museum.",MaryLouise H
50,Fabulous boutique museum - one of my favorites,I live in Pasadena area and enjoy visiting some of my favorite art regularly. A visit is re-energizing and inspiring for me. Powerful. I always mean to go to the Cafe for lunch during some workdays - incredible sculpture garden. I haven't quite done that yet. What a collection!,Robert G
50,Must see!,"Incredible collection, beautiful space. Not at all crowded. Nose to nose with a Rembrandt! And lucky us, we saw Whistler's Mother on Mother's day!",Patty G
40,World Class Fine Art - worth the detour,"I had often heard of the Norton Simon museum and finally had a chance to visit while in the Pasadena area.It is a truly exceptional small museum with four highlights: European Old Masters, French Impressionists, Indian bronzes and 20th Garden statuary (Moore and Maillol).We spent two hours visiting the collection and had a very enjoyable time ending with coffee and cake in the garden cafe.Not much information is provided in the rooms so be sure to get the audioguide. Students are free but must show their ID.The museum is ideal for Adults and Young Adults looking for an overview of European painting, or who love Impressionism. There are programmed children's activities but these should be investigated before a visit for time and availability.",jroussel
50,One of the top 5 museums of this size I've ever visited,Likes: the exquisite curation; the depth of the Renaissance collection; the unexpectedly comprehensive Southeast Asian collection.Dislikes: that it seems like this place is not being seen by a wide enough audience.,Resnyc
50,"Clean, classy, calm","The most recent exhibit includes selected art from the Musee D'Orsay - so if you don't have a trip to Paris planned anytime soon - head over to the Norton Simon Museum. We arrived on a Saturday morning and there was plenty of parking and the museum was not crowded. The exhibits were beautiful and we spent over two hours leisurely strolling the galleries. The outside gardens were closed due to rain but from what we could see through the cafe area, we will be back to explore the outdoor space as well.",christineess

There are great collections…lots of Degas sculptures, Rodin statues, impressionists, modern art, religious art, Asian, etc.The current new exhibition is Whistler & other paintings from Musee D’Orsay in Paris…we went on a Thursday and for some reason seniors were able to see it for free; otherwise it is an additional $10.You need to get there when it opens at noon to get decent parking.The outdoor café has great quick lunches…be sure to share a sandwich as they are huge.",Sheilakeel

50,a complete package,"Even the entrance is lovely, and sets the tone for the delights to follow. A great collection, displayed masterfully in a quiet and intimate setting. The Sculpture Garden was beautiful, and rivaled any garden in the city.",Kathleen P
50,A Beautiful Oasis,"The museum was exhibiting three masterpieces, from the Musee D'Orsay alongside paintings from the permanent collection. Ironic that that the icon of American Impressionism (""Whistler's Mother"") is owned by a French museum. The permanent collection alone is worth the visit. The gardens and lilly pond provide a cool respite from a hot L.A. afternoon. Even if part of the sculpture garden was closed to protect a pair of nesting geese. Try the cafe. Good, cheap eats.",GentleKnight
50,Beautiful art made a beautiful family day.,We took our 17 year old son and several of his friends. The kids were in awe of the art and the museum. I highly recommend the Norton Simon Museum for families with teenagers. I then recommend Old Town Pasadena for lunch or dinner.,Ricky J
50,Hidden gem for art lovers,The museum holds an impressive private collection of well known works. The curators do an excellent job of presenting how artists and schools influence one another. Go for the Degas collection alone.Check for on loan displays here. We stumbled upon the Orsay collection while visiting and that was a treat.,JackandResh
20,Provincial museum with more security presence than the Pentagon,"The museum building itself is a lovely piece of architecture, and the gardens very charming. The art was perhaps a bit second rate, eg a few solitary Brancusis and some lesser known works by Degas, Picasso and van Gogh. But if you like Asian artefacts you're in for a treat (we're not particularly), and there's plenty of unknown pre-1800 art should you be in the mood. Whistler's Mother had also popped in from Paris when we were visiting, so that was nice.A bigger issue is the general atmosphere: security guards are everywhere, and the atmosphere is consequently oppressive. You feel you are being constantly watched, in a way that the charming and helpful guards in places like the Art Institute in Chicago somehow avoid.They also opened 20 minutes late, but the guards on the door were pretty aggressive when asked (repeatedly, by different visitors) when it would open. Possibly charm and an apology - rather than scowling and a dismissive wave of the hand - would have worked better here.",Rick D
50,World-Class Art Museum,My wife and I have visited this museum 3 times and have enjoyed it each time. It houses a world-class collection of European paintings in a very pleasant environment.

50,Great way to spend an afternoon,"The museum is small enough that you can see everything in a few hours without feeling overwhelmed, yet filled with extraordinary art from around the world and from ancient times to modern art.",Jeff B
50,Good hidden gem,"If you like museums, this is a must. They have great collections, from Renaissance to Modernism, European art to Asian artifacts and sculptures. Their garden and cafe is also really nice. The museum is never crowded which is great if you want to enjoy peace and quiet while taking in all the art.",Randa J
50,wonderful museum,had an exhibit from the D'Orsay in Paris. Beautiful outside garden with sculptures. there's also a nice little cafe to get drinks and sandwiches.,Stephen C
50,Fantastic museum!,Well worth a visit - this is a serious art museum with an impressive collection. The price was reasonable and it took us at least 3 hours to see it all!,travelbug313NH
50,Excellent,"Although Norton Simon is small as art museums go, this makes it all the more traversable and enjoyable. There is more Degas and other Impressionists than I've seen west of the MOMA. It is truly a remarkable collection, and it is unimaginable that one person would have the resources to not only amass it, but also share it. The sculptures alone are worth the visit.",Mary R
50,World class art museum in exquisite surroundings,"I visited the Norton Simon Museum with a friend on Friday March 13th, 2015. This gem of a museum, next to old Pasadena, has a world class art collection and is well worth a trip to Pasadena. I visited it numerous times during the 5 years that I lived in Pasadena, this was my first visit since I left 25 years ago. The enchantment remains the same... The modern and elegant building with its exterior of distinct brown tiles (115.000 glazed tiles) is tucked in beautiful landscaping, with the entrance esplanade decorated with striking bronze sculptures by Auguste Rodin (of which there are multiple copies in the world, not least at the Rodin Museum in Paris), including the expressionist Bourgeois de Calais. The medium sized rooms with high ceilings are optimally lighted and intimate. The museum has in store 11.000 objects, of which only 800 - 900 are exhibited at any given time. The paintings and sculptures are accompanied by didactic explanations. The permanent exhibit shows masters of European art from the 14th-16th century (including the magnificent Adam and Eve from Lucas Cranach the Elder), 17th-18th century including Rubens, Rembrandt, Zurbaran and Murillo), 19th century including French impressionists (Manet, Renoir, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Gauguin and a vast Degas collection including sculptures of ballet dancers and horses), and modern and contemporary paintings from Europe and the US (including Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Klee, Kandinsky and the German Blue Riders), as well as sculptures a.o.of Giacometti and Brancusi. One can literally have a stunning panorama of the entire occidental art history in one visit.The sculpture garden outside is beautifully lanscaped around a big pond reminiscent of Monet's Giverny gardens, with sculptures a.o. from Maillol, Henry Moore and Rodin. My friend and I soaked some spring sun with a couple of beers in the patio café...There is also a floor downstairs with Asian art that we did not visit this time, and an auditorium.I consider the Norton Simon to be truly one of the most exquisite art museums in the world.",Pierre_De_Meyts

50,"Exceptional, World Class","As art museum junkies, my wife and I have developed a bit of cynicism about various permanent collections. Not so with the Norton-Simon. This is truly a world class collection, not only of the ""classics"" but also of Asian Art. The docent suggested we watch the film which really provides a perspective on Norton Simon and his desire to make the museum special. We visited both Getty Museums, the Huntingdon, and LACounty on this trip and the Norton-Simon was our favorite.Our only regret was not leaving enough time - we arrived at 5PM on a Friday nite as our Pasadena App indicated the museum was open till 9. Not so, so make sure you check the hours from the museum itself.",Philip C
50,Amazing collections,"This was an amazing trip. There were so many artists on display. It was a fun and educational experience. Now I can say that I've seen a Rembrandt, Picasso, Monet in person. Everything was a moment in history.But this is a huge place, there are 2 levels, you might want to experience it in sections.I was exhausted by the time I was done. I will go back and enjoy the other sections better.",Yadira C
40,Who knew?,"This is not a small, local museum. Much to my surprise, this is a ""real"" museum with Van Goghs, Rembrandts and more. If you're not up for fighting the traffic into LA to visit LACMA, this should hit the spot.",AmyfromPasadena
50,Best Museum Experience of my Life,"What a perfect three and a half hours I spent at the Norton Simon. If you like the masters as well as the impressionists, you couldn't ask for a nicer collection. I'd never consider myself a ""museum goer"" per se, even though I've been to some pretty notable ones throughout the world, but the Norton Simon made me want to become one. The sculpture garden and cafe were magical and so well integrated. Best 15 bucks I've spent in ages!",weewilly2014
50,Don't miss and leave plenty of time for your visit,"We visited three wonderful places in Pasadena at the end of a stay on the west coast (from England): the Norton Simon, the Huntington Library, and the Gamble House. All were amazing, but had similar closing days so needed careful planning, especially as there was so much to enjoy at them all.The Norton Simon has a diverse collection of top class works in a well designed building with a lovely sculpture garden. It is right beside a freeway but landscaping and extensive tree planting give plenty of protection.We failed to see much of the basement section on Asian art because we ran out of time but that only means we will have to come back again.Pasadena Old Town is pleasant too. If you stay there all the attractions mentioned above are easily reachable even without a car, as there are plenty of buses.",geoffrey.hollis
50,Very Impressive Collection!,"I recently visited the Norton Simon museum with my daughter for a field trip. I was very impressed with the art collection, the museum grounds and our docent was fantastic. I've never had a docent at a art museum before but it definitely added to the experience.",Fieldtravels
40,Remarkable private collection of amazing art,"The Norton Simon is a not-to-be-missed experience in the LA area. This private collection includes Southeast Asian and European Renaissance with more than 12,000 items on display. The gardens are especially beautiful and contain many sculptures. Excellent!",SDwalkerSOCAL
50,Great painting collections and wonderful sculpture garden,"This is a smaller museum, with much to enjoy indoors as well as outdoors. One of my favorite areas is the area that displays impressionists like Cezanne, Pisarro, Van Gogh, Manet, Renoir and others. There is a small Renoir I particularly liked, a painting of a gathering of several men in Renoir's studio; one of the men is Cezanne. An early Renoir also caught my attention, a scene depicting the Pont des Arts in Paris. There are several Van Gogh's that allow you to see the progression of his painting throughout his sadly short career, including a protrait of his mother. We also enjoyed the lovely sculpture gardens inspired in Monet's Giverny. We enjoyed a light meal at a very pleasant outdoor garden cafe which is in the garden itself, where you can view the pond, sculptures and landscape. It seems a kid frinedly museum, with some of the brochures designed specifically for children.",GloriaD121
50,Wonderful Collection,This museum has a wonderful impressionist collection It also has a number of sculptures and paintings for the 15-16th century. I would recommend doing the impressionist side last as it far more enjoyable. The grounds are also pleasant to walk around.,Barbara Maxwell
50,Impressive collection and sculpture garden,"If you have the opportunity, visit on the first Friday night of the month between 5-8p for free admission. Otherwise, visit this great little museum that is loaded with gems of art. There were five Van Goghs on display, a bunch of other famous impressionists and a collection of Renaissance art from Europe. The outdoor sculpture garden is great. The museum is well laid out. Very easy to visit, not a labyrinth of interconnected rooms. Very simple design, ensuring that you won't miss anything. Well worth your time.",RTWtraveler213
50,Pleasant surprise,"We spent one night in Pasadena and since the weather was quite cool, we decided to visit this museum not really expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised! Fantastic collection of art, all of the famous painters are well represented, very nice layout, beautiful garden. Lots of sculptures by Rodin and Degas in and around the museum. Definitely one of the nicest museums we've visited and we've been to quite a few. Don't miss if you're in the area. There is ample parking space (free) outside. Reasonable entrance fee (USD 12 pp when we were there).",MiaEJ2013

I saw multiple educational tours going on while I was there. The grounds are beautiful and they have an outdoor cafe that had surprisingly good quick food.Parking was free.It was great to rediscover this Southern California treasure,Michael M
50,Perfect size for a quick art fix,"I love this place because it's like a mini-Met. They have fantastic examples of just about everything and it's not a life-long project to see it all. When I just want a nice outing with my elderly mom or a little culture fix when my daughter is getting too attached to reality TV this is the perfect afternoon. The grounds are beautiful, the giftshop always something unusual, and the café outside is a nice place to read if you are solo.",Ann G
50,I Love this museum--unbelievable collection of impressionist and Degas,This museum has an amazing collection of impressionist paintings and sculptures that are world class in quality and scale. It is a small and manageable museum with beautiful gardens outside where you can have lunch from a Patina restaurant. And right now they have one of the most famous paintings by Edouard Manet on exhibit until early March. Well worth a visit if you are from out of town--Its a little off the beaten path (15 minutes North of downtown) but if you like Impressionists it is definitely worth the trip.,TheKoonah
50,Beautiful Museum,We spent about 4 hours at the museum. We used the audio guide which was great. The cost of admission is $12.00 and $3.00 for the audio. The museum also has a cafe and beautiful outside garden. Check out the unusual tree at the far end of the pond. It is spectacular.,wwjd1947
50,A little bit of a hike but well worth it!,"From downtown LA, I caught a local light rail train here which was a fun and easy experience.A beautiful walk through Pasadena (not Big Bang Nerds in sight!).My only regret was I should have allowed more time to see the displays.Set in beautiful gardens, and with a collection that is stunning-time period pieces, asian art and the list goes on. The European Renaissance painters were amazing. Boudin, Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, etc etcI should have allowed more than 3 hours and I'm not even an art lover!A definite must see in LA!",Greg S

50,Well worth an extended visit,"Lovely collection of Chola bronzes and other SE Asian sculpture. A good overview collection of paintings from the 14th cent. through modern: While some of the paintings are not among the best work produced by that particular artist, the curating is exceptional: The more-extensive-than-usual signage accompanying each painting and sculpture, describing why this particular artist or work of art is significant, the symbolism or providing some additional context more than makes up for any particular piece that is less than the artist's best (and many of the pieces really are wonderful when evaluated on their own merits). The sculpture garden is also a pleasant place to enjoy a cup of coffee. Too bad the food offerings are so limited.",2trvel
50,calm and beautiful place in the middle of LA to spend an afternoon,A small but very high quality collection of beautiful and accessible art which makes for a very nice half day visit.

40,A Pasadena Gem,"A fine museum that can be toured within a few hours. There is an excellent collection of Degas sculptures, as well as works by Rembrandt and Jan Steen, and a fair sampling of modern work. Terrific films and lectures as well.

The art is well organized and labeled and the setting is relaxing-- including a beautiful sculpture garden where you can enjoy a glass of wine, cup of coffee or other small repast.

50,Wonderful surprise,"We recently visited the Norton Simon during a vacation. We knew that the museum existed but were not prepared for the overall excellence that we encountered. There are many interesting European impressionist paintings and modern works by Picasso and others, but the Dutch/Belgian works are truly outstanding- Rembrandt et al. The galleries are spacious, well lit and easy to navigate. Grounds are attractive.",jakegreenville

You take pictures as much as you want. But do not touch the exhibits: it's a must everywhere. Do not bring liquid with you. You can buy drinking water inside. There are a few places to eat.

The Impressionist, post-impressionist and modernist art is as good as it gets anywhere. The museum is surrounded by terraced gardens that display spectacular works of sculpture in small plazas and enclosed niches. The plantings are well chosen and there is plenty of outdoor seating. It's a great place to spend an hour or two in California's unbelievable winter sun.The Norton Simon is worth a trip to California by itself, but you could see it and the Getty Museum on the same day with some careful planning.",BlueNWashington

50,Just beautiful! Food for the soul!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Norton Simon this weekend, but one day is not nearly enough time to take in all this lovely museum has to offer. Several scultptures by Rodin greet you coming up to the entry way. My husband really appreciated the Asian art collection with renowned pieces from India, Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand and much more to their collection. I am more so attracted to the European arts of Lippi, Raphael, Rembrant & more, all stunning. The Café outdoors is beautifully set in the garden, but exorbitantly priced....2 Turkey Sandwiches, 2 Champagnes & Water was $58.",TravelerSophia
50,A great art museum,This collection covers art from medieval to modern art. There are a few examples of almost every type of painting but the examples are outstanding.,DAVID D
50,Beautiful!,It's very impressive with it's famous paintings. My favorite is Vincent vanGogh. What a thrill to his real work. The architecture of the facility had a modern twist. Rooms and rooms of paintings and sculptures. It was great but didn't compare to the Getty in Los Angeles. They do have a snack bar out doors with a very beautiful and serene atmosphere. I do recommend going.,MassTraveler2013
50,BEAUTIFUL COLLECTION IN A STUNNING BUILDING!,"Aesthetically the setting for both the interior art collections and the sculpture gardens is pleasing and relaxing. Small enough to cover in a few hours, easy to park, this is certainly a destination spot in Pasadena.

50,A Lesser Known Museum of Excellent Quality,"The Norton Simon is a very good museum, having a collection spanning many historical areas of art, and having them very well displayed and annotated. Their collection of Degas bronze sculptures is outstanding, both those smaller ones inside the museum and those larger ones along the walkway to the entrance. During busy times the parking can be difficult, and the small restaurant, though being able to offer enough to keep your appetite in line, doesn't really offer items that make you happy you're eating there. That's a shame because the garden setting for the eatery is quite enchanting.",338RobertC338

This museum was a reasonable walk down Colorado Ave (or take advantage of the free parking); convenient to the Old Town shopping and restaurant district. Definitely worth a visit. Impressive collection of old world masters and modern artists. Not crowded by most museum standards. We also enjoyed a nice break at the small cafe in the attractive courtyard/garden/pond area. I was surprised to read some of the reviews regarding the ""oppressive"" security...I did not notice anything unusual with respect to the staff or guards.",msipple919

These pieces have been stored away and there are some lovely pieces to be seen. We also looked at old favorites by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Pissaro, Cezanne, Degas, etc, We've found we see something new every time we look at the paintings and sculptures; therefore, once is really not enough. There's also a modern art and Asian Art section, a wonderful outdoor space with a lily pond and cafe, and free parking. $12 admission and $9 for seniors.

50,Great Afternoon escape from the heat of the day,"My girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter and I Visited on a Sunday to small, manageable crowds.Though a smaller intimate museum the collections housed are exceptional as are diverse.Paintings including some of the well known artists such as Van Gogh, Matisse, Picasso, Kandinsky, etc, you can find sculptures by Degas inside, Rodin out in the front walking into the museum. Several Asian statues are here too. Not too mention a scattering of Reubens, Brughel among many others less known, but not less appreciated in the various parts of the museum.The cost for an adult is not obscene at $12, and students with ID and military are free. GREAT!!! Savings for an afternoon out.The sculpture garden provided an enjoyable chance to get some fresh air, while appreciating some of the many works done by the Sculpture Moore.The gift shop was a plethora of items to choose from, though I was suprised with the employees of whom felt disengaged with the patrons here unlike the rest of the people of whom we met about the museum.Finally it was great to be able to take photos and get up close to the works, from which the trip can be later remembered and inspiring long after the trip is done.Also nice is the complimentary card of a changing artist work when exiting.",Stuart F
50,a perfect museum,after being less than excited by The Getty Centre it was joy to visit this brilliant museum again. The collection is top quality and the building easy to negotiate. On a very hot day it would have been better if we could have had our lunch indoors but that is a small comment.,Alan S

50,You Have To See It For Yourself,"September 2014. Never been to the Norton Simon Museum before. Wow. Beautiful, inspirational, both inside and out.There are so many wonderful collections around Southern California (such as Riverside County's Edward-Dean Museum) which are the result of personal acquisitions made available for public viewing. Having viewed just a portion of the Norton Simon collection and walked the accessible sculpture garden with lovely pond, this museum isn't only for a one-time visit. It is absolutely worthwhile to come back on a regular basis, certainly to recharge one's creative batteries - and also to experience beauty without distraction, The Norton Simon Museum doesn't appear to be an overwhelming tourist attraction, which makes it so compelling.You simply have to see for yourself.",TrademarkTraveler
40,Easily Missed Gem,I drove by this place several times without knowing much about what was inside. I finally stopped on a hot morning to enjoy the A/C but found a major art museum. It features both painting an sculpture from around the world. It also has a nice outdoor sculpture garden and a movie theater.,SockFour
30,The Hidden Museum,"It was enjoyable to see the sculpture collection at the front and to stroll around the Sculpture Garden located at the back of the premises. My family goes to LA every-year. If it was our first time we never would have gone to this museum with it being located in the outskirts of LA which also makes it isolating. If you're someone who's overwhelmed by museums this shouldn't be too overwhelming; however do expect to spend a minimum of 3 hours here if you want to see the whole museum. There were lots of paintings (of course) some of which were cool but it was hard for me to keep my attention span going despite I love the arts. However, the sculptures captured my attention to a fair degree so that was a true highlight for me.",Brett E

50,First rate collection that doesn't overwhelm,"This may be the ideal museum for me - judiciously selected examples of excellent - though often less well known - pieces by marquee artists, especially in the European section, that are not submerged by a vast number of other works, as is typical in larger museums. A couple of quibbles: the tastefully designed Japanese garden is a Westernized version, rather than one that might be found in Japan and the Asian art section lacks any works from that island nation. The Buddhist quilt in the Land of Snow exhibition was magnificent and well explained. Indeed all of the captions are among the very best anywhere - giving context and background for the uninitiated as well as details of the specific paintings and other objects. My camera inadvertently flashed and brought a gentle reminder about photography restrictions from one of the many guards that populate the building. Another guard provided informed commentary on the Asian art as well as directions to specific works. If you are short of time and can only visit one LA area art museum this should probably be the one.",Taughboyne
50,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Breathtaking pieces. Very impressed with the caliber of art in a museum this size. We did not visit the statues gardens because we lost time in the works of Van Gogh, Picasso and Degas. Staff is friendly. We were there during a Goya exhibit and were affected by the art's presence. Highly recommend!!!",Ali R
50,Joyful place,"It's all been said before, but I'll pile on: the Norton Simon Museum is wonderful. Art museums like the Louvre, the Met, and the Getty can be so overwhelming because the collections are huge and the crowds are huge-er. The Norton Simon Museum is less crowded, and you can see the entire (stellar!) collection in half a day.",peppah
50,A gem,"I took my friend who was visiting from Arizona. She has been to art museums all over the world and, like me, she was awed by this fabulous collection. As an architect, she appreciated the design and function of the building and the grounds. We were there from 1-5 pm and only managed to see the 20th century art, the Asian Art on the lower level, and the sculpture garden. Allow enough time to see it all. Degas, Renoir, Picasso, Braque, Kandinsky, and on and on. It is a very fine collection of art and sculpture. Yes, the guards are everywhere, but we were allowed to go much closer to the artwork than many other museums I have visited.",Lyn K
50,Don't Miss This!,"Beautiful art museum chock-full of the most popular artists' works. Amazing Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. I've never seen so many Degas paintings and sculptures in one location. Fewer very modern/current pieces - and more Madonnas than I care to see. Easily viewed in one morning or afternoon. Very easy to get to from the 134 freeway with free parking. There is a café on-site, which we didn't use.",SunGoddess58528
50,A Jewel in Pasadena's Crown,"I have been in museums all over the world. Many are bigger and have more impressive collections but this one remains a favorite. It is designed impeccably with taste and function in mind. I love the fact that its relatively small and so accessible. Its an easy half day excursion and the galleries are designed for optimum viewing pleasure.The collection itself is just stunning. From antiquities to Old Masters to Impressionists and Modern Art, it has a wonderful sampling. Above all, it is not overwhelming. Its just right.There is also a very beautiful garden and pond outside in the courtyard area with a garden cafe.This is an ideal museum for hard core art enthusiasts, first time museum goers or for parents who want to introduce their children to fine art and museums. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed in this superb museum.",kewlbreezes51
50,Nice cafe,"They have one of the nicest cafes in Pasadena, especially if you're up to a good view, tiny wildlide and small and healthy portions. The overall atmosphere of the museum is nice, not too big and not too small.",coolboat
50,Just lovely!,"A lovely museum that is in a relaxing, beautiful setting. LA can be garish at times, Norton Simon Museum is a quiet respite from all the noise and strife. I would recommend for families with children who are 12 and up. I didn't see any younger children on my visit but the museum may have hours/programs geared for that purpose. The security staff can be off putting at times but they do have tremendous responsibility. Staff at the reception areas are quite pleasant and personable. Sculpture garden is very beautiful!",Marianne B
40,Beautiful gallery,"A calm and beautiful art museum and gallery, in a relaxed environment. We liked the mixture of old and new, and the great overall presentation of the works of art.",R H
30,"Officious, heavy handed security...","This is a gem of a museum, with a small, well formed collection. The sculpture garden features Henry Moore and Jacque Lipchitz in a lovely setting. I took my two sons (9,11), who have spent much time in museums. The security guards were continuously on top of them, warning us to ""please stay away from the painting, the frame and the wall"" and ""please do not let your children walk in front of you"". They had no intention of touching a painting and the boys had moved ahead of me to see something which interested them.The message staff gave out was ""everything here is too precious, stay away."" I found this distressing, as I used to work for a museum; we have had many an enjoyable hour at the Louvre, the National Gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.I recommend the Huntington Library if you are in this neighborhood. The collection of paintings is limited to the 18th century, but the Library is fascinating, the grounds extensive - and the staff that works there delightful - helpful, informative and welcoming.",550kquinn
40,A different visiting point for LA tour,"Compare to other LA visiting points, Norton Simon Museum do worth a trip. At lease the paintings and the bronzes will lighting your eyes (away from outlet and Disney world!)... Relax and have a coffee at the beautiful garden. (Personally, recommand the Degas collections.) Nevertheless, please don't except it is as rich as the National Museum in any Europe city. And there is a staff guarding the garden (don't know why), make you hardly take a good picture without having her in sight. :(BTW, try to carry ONLY camera and money with you; they will ask you to check-in (and maybe search) the purses, backpack, etc... items you carried in the museum.",dianac49
50,Like a mini Louvre,"Absolutely loved this place! We were there on a fairly busy day but never felt the crowds. The audio tours are amazing. Just a huge tip though. This was our first time at the museum and we started to the right of the main entry with the Renaissance artists. But we spent so much time in this area that we did not realize to the left of the main entry are the more ""contemporary"" artists of Picasso, Monet, Degas, etc. We spent hours there and missed out on this except for a quick walk through. Next time we will do the audio tours for this section. Don't miss this place!",Colleen5555
50,A must see for art lovers,The Norton Simon Museum is truly a treasure. It has an excellent quality collection of fine art by European Masters and others. The facility is first rate and the grounds are well maintained. There is a modest entrance fee but parking is free. The Gift Shop/Bookstore was small but well stocked and prices were competitive. I certainly will go again.,Jeffrey C
40,A Must Visit,"This was my first time visiting a museum in Pasadena. I know there are other attractions but I chose this one because of the positive feedback it got from Trip Advisor. My family and I were lucky that there were no entrance fee as it was a ""free"" day during fourth of July.Parking was a bit challenging. Luckily, waiting long enough there was someone leaving. Walking towards the museum I noticed there were a lot of statues. Thought it was interesting and somewhat was a preview of what to expect inside.Upon entering you see the garden at the back. BEAUTIFUL! It took a good 1-2 hours to see the whole museum. There were a lot of museum staff in each exhibit room policing the area. I did feel somewhat uncomfortable as I felt their eyes looking at me as though I did something wrong. It was sometimes hard to concentrate and look at the art piece especially when you feel like the one on display! I know taking pictures are allowed (as long as there were no flash), which many abided by, including me. But still their watchful eye was very uncomfortable.The artwork/exhibits itself were decent. The old medieval, dark paintings I did not care for but I did enjoy the Asian Art area and most especially the garden with the statues. Very picturesque.I thought it was an enjoyable visit.",TRTW
50,one of the best collections of old European masters,"This museum should be on everyone's list when in the LA area. It has one of the most incredible collections of old European masters. To name a few: Adam and Eve by Cranach the Elder, self-portrait with black velvet beret by Rembrandt, Rembrandt's portrait of his young boy Julius, one of Rafael's Madonna with the child Jesus, one of Brancusi's Maiastra, and a lot more. The walls look like the art history textbook. There are significant pieces by: Degas, Manet, Corot, Courbet, Seurat, Berthe Morisot, Rubens, Botticelli, Tiepolo, Peter Breugel, Goya, El Greco, Zurbaran, Renoir, Henri Moore, Auguste Rodin. The museum is a must see and one should plan for a 4-5 hour visit. There is a short film about Norton Simon and his collection - check the museum's site for hours. It is closed on Tuesdays.",MarietaBC
30,Worth a visit if convenient,"Worth a visit if in Pasadena or nearby, but not worth a special trip. The bus stop is right outside, and afterwards it is easy to walk into Old Pasadena for a drink. An interesting collection, better on its European masters than the 20th century paintings, even though the latter did include some Picasso's . The bronzes outside are good, usually amongst first, castings, and the Burghers of Calais is well placed. The Henry Moore garden is an interesting way to present his statues, surrounded in shrubbery and worth a visit. The only cafe is a disappointment - better to take your own, if you can, or wait until later.",HerculePiorot
50,Art is peaceful on these Beautiful grounds,"First rate museum that is right in the middle of everything Pasadena....so many showings of fine paintings and the grounds are just the right size for the beginning of the afternoon or a can be included for a relaxing, affordable time of reflection and viewing after a dinner out! I especially like that I could walk from room to room quickly so I could compare the same artist's work from different periods.",Teresa S
50,A beautiful art museum with magnificent collections,"This art museum contains one of the finest collections of French Impressionist paintings on the North American continent. In addition, it possesses and displays major European works of the 18th and 19th centuries as well as many examples of significant modern and contemporary art. It is a joy for us to visit on each and every occasion and we do so frequently. It has been a mainstay in our intellectual life since its current incarnation which was begun in the mid 1970’s.The Norton Simon museum is a relatively small one and the various works of art in the collections are rotated frequently. This gives the museum a fresh look each time one visits. The museum has an excellent curatorial staff and the data provided on the information cards next to the paintings have been both carefully and accurately prepared.The beautifully designed and well kept grounds of the museum exude an air of peace and tranquility and there is a large comfortable seating area. An extensive sculpture garden engulfs you as you eat your lunch in a quiet courtyard or on a bench near the pond, alone with your thoughts and the sculptural masterpieces.",Rolf Z
50,It is closed on Tuesday.,We walked around the outside of the home which the gardens and architecture was stellar. It is a craftsman home. Next visit we will go inside. It is close to the Arboretum so we went there instead! Wonderful place.,YogaGirl25
50,An absolute treasure and a bargain.,"I've been to the Norton Simon twice in the last couple of years and was delighted. In the Los Angeles area you are invited to the fabulous Getty Museum on the top of the hill and the wonderful LACMA. Frankly, as good as those venues are, I was more excited to visit the Norton Simon. I was an art major in college (many years ago) and seeing the collection here is like revisiting my art appreciation class. The museum is smaller than the 2 previous museums mentioned but this is a big plus. The museum is divided into sections exhibiting different time periods and styles of art. For example, in the Impressionist section, I almost gasped out loud at what I saw included. The best of the best! Matisse, Van Gogh, Pisarro, Tolouse Latrec, etc. The quality of the exhibit is amazing; both paintings and sculpture. And the outside sculpture garden is beautiful including Henry Moore and Calder. If I lived nearer to Pasadena I would visit at least once a week. Even more amazing is it is Free admission. Love art? Don't miss this.",Patrick D
40,Very Pleasant Surprise,"I had a free afternoon and toured this museum. This was a very pleasant surprise. The parking is free. The entrance of the facility is adorned with sculpture. The facility is easy to tour. There is a variety of artists. The collection is impressive. Degas, Rafael, Monet and others. I was able to see the ""Adam and Eve"" paintings. Currently, the museum is featuring an exhibit from the Far East/Asia. It is impressive. The museum has a good selection of art from the Chola Dynasty. There are statutes outside on the lower level and a sitting area. The area is very peaceful and a place where one can reflect and rest.I had lunch there in the courtyard. There is ample seating. You can grab lunch and enjoy the sculpture. It is reasonably priced.You can go on-line and purchase your ticket and save a dollar or so. The admission was $10. Equipment is on-hand for a video tour which highlights many of the works of art.There is a gift shop and it is reasonably priced. This is a wonderful way to spend a day. You are in for a treat. If you want to view paintings from early renaissance to the post impressionistic era and see beautiful sculptures, then this is the place to go. The facility is located right off of Colorado Blvd so it is easy to find and you can go to downtown Pasadena and grab a bite to eat or shop. I really enjoyed my visit.",AJ S
50,Just about nothin' beats the Norton,"The Norton Simon museum is that brown bricked building you see donned with the big red rose every New Year's Day morning during the Rose Parade. Having grown up in Pasadena, I have been to the museum many times--sometimes during school field trips, once for research while enrolled in an art history class and most times because the place always brings a sense of peace and soothing while reminding me how amazing life and history are. Each time I have been there, I have found myself thinking ""I really need to come here more often than I do."" Art runs the gamut from Renaissance to modern, Hindu sandstone sculptures to the bronze ballerinas of Degas and you will even find a few Picassos, Van Goghs, and Kandinskys housed within the walls of the living time capsule known as the Norton Simon.Aside from the beauty, getting to and finding the building is very easy, parking is free, the entrance fee is minimal, and you are instantly transported to a safe haven when there.Lastly, Old Town Pasadena begins less than a mile away from the museum so you can continue pondering the art, or discussing if with friends, while eating and/or shopping.My last piece of advice: Make sure you go!",LincolnOsiris
50,GO NOW!,"I'd heard this was an incredible museum. I'd been to LA about 5 times and well, Pasadena just seemed far and out of the way. Finally after hearing too many times, from my friends that I had to go, I went. And I'm glad I did. VERY high quality art. (not like that other more accessible place) At one point I think I was in a room with 4 Rembrandts- pretty awesome.",x r
50,"Well curated, high quality pieces",The Norton Simon Museum is a relatively small museums with a very quality collection. Major styles and schools from early renaissance to post-impressionism are represented well in a balanced manner. The highlights of the collection would include Rafael - Madonna and Child; Bijlert - Man in armour; Degas - sculptures of dancers. The delightful garden is also a good place to relax during your visit.Another noteworthy feature of the Norton Simon is Asian art. There is a remarkable collection of Chola Dynasty bronzes and excellent Gandhara stone scultpures. Not so sure about the provenance but superb pieces.,E150A
50,Small Gem,"The Norton Simon Museum is a small but lovely museum. They usually have well mounted exhibits. Their sculptures are worth seeing, I enjoy sitting in their outdoor space. As a footnote Norton Simon was married to the stunning actress Jennifer Jones, (A Farewell To Arms)",Jeremy T
50,A gem. Very strong on hindu art and impressionist painting.,"This smallish museum that you can get through in 2-4 hours, is an oasis of quiet, includes a nice water garden. The collection is very strong in early Hindu statuary. There is a small collection (maybe a hundred paintings) of high quality European art, renaissance and later. The strongest emphasis is European paintings and sculptures from Courbet on through Picasso. Many Degas, Renoirs, Rodins. One of the best small museums anywhere.",Ron S
40,Nice Quick Museum,Great place to go to if you don't want to spend all day in a museum and usually not too crowded.

50,Best small museum in Country,"Amazing selection in a small intimate venue. Impressionists, Asian Art, Classics, Sculpture garden. This is for museum lovers and those that need to get dragged to museums. It is all hits and well laid out. Spend the time to go. It's a great couple of hours.",fpk932
50,We Love The Norton Simon and Keep Returning!!,"We have visited the Norton Simon many times over the years and are never disappointed. The collection is varied and interesting with several beautiful Rembrandt's and a spectacular Mulberry Tree by Van Gogh and most everything in the collection is top notch quality. The setting allows for leisurely taking your time to learn about each piece and you can easily see the entire museum in about 3 hours. Starting July 2014, the entrance fee increases ($12 Adult) and the opening time is one hour earlier at 11:00 AM. Parking is free and the location is convenient to the freeway.",parisienfoodisgood

50,Great Private Museum in Pasadena,This is a smaller museum with what began as a private collection and has expanded slowly and carefully with some very quality pieces. The outdoor sculpture garden is a highlight. Definitely worth a visit on your trip to Pasadena.,David
40,Pleasant setting for art,This was a smaller sidetrip during our LA stay. This museum has a very nice collection of paintings from 1400s to 1900s that are attractively displayed according to centuries. There was much interesting information on the title cards with each painting. There is a small outdoor garden with a few sculputures. A pleasant place to relax.We ran out of time to visit the Asian Art on the lower floor.,Carol765
50,Quality over Quantity.,"How could have I not written a review for this place?!?!Well, it's been ten years since my last visit and it holds it own when compared to the larger ones like Lacma and Getty despite it's size. You don't need to park and take and elevator or trolley to get to the museum.What impressed me is despite the smaller space the museum had done a great job in curating modern works from renown artists such as Picasso, Degas, Renior, Van Gogh, etc. Plus, a small botanical garden wraps around the back of the museum.Another large exhibit is the one dedicated to Buddhist statues from India and Southeast Asia and that takes up most of that floor.Also, note that students and children under 18 gain free admission. Also, their hours will be changed July 1.I wish I didn't live so far from here as I would visit it more often. Until next time NSM.",monica k
50,every piece a masterpiece,"While Norton Simon is not among the grandest art museums in the world, every piece is truly a masterpiece, and for those who get overwhelmed by the mega art museums in Europe, like the Vatican Museums, the Prado, the Hermitage, the Louvre, etc., this museum provides a taste of all the great masters but can easily be enjoyed in 2-3 hours. Norton Simon himself selected the works, and later in life, he added an impressive collection of Indian and South Asian sculpture and artifacts to his already impressive collection of European masters.This is a museum not to be missed for art lovers or those who want to be.",Anthony-Susan
50,Cultural Wow!,"I loved my visit to this museum. I was pleasantly surprised to find many of my favorites represented. Monet, Klee, Picasso, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, Cézanne.

50,Surprise,I was in Pasadena for business and had a couple of hours to see the place. I had no idea about this place. It cost $10.00 and well worth it--even for a man who is not an art historian and a huge fan. I really enjoyed myself.,Dunn45
50,European art well displayed,"Recently I visited this museum for the first time in over a decade. I was reminded of how fabulous the collection is for European art from the 14th century on. Many Impressionist paintings, for fans of Monet, Manet, Cezanne, Van Gogh, et al. Also beautiful Rembrandts and other Dutch artists like Ruysdael and van Ostade. A spectacularly beautiful Botticelli Virgin and child. Well worth a visit. We didn't try the cafe or go into the garden court, but it looked lovely.",NYscholar2
50,MY FAVORITE L.A. MUSEUM,"Much as I love LACMA, having grown up there, starting in its old location in the 1950s, the Norton Simon has definitely supplanted it in my heart and soul. It's small enough to be able to take in most of the exhibits in an afternoon, with exquisite examples of major and minor artists, as well as a large section devoted to Asian and South Asian works. It's a wonderful place to spend a rainy afternoon.",Kris W
50,What an amazing secret!,"It may be my ignorance but I knew not of this museum until 11am this morning. Quite simply it is one of the worlds great art galleries! Probably the best diplay of Degas bronzes on the planet! That is not to speak of the Rodins, Picassos,Van Goghs, Monets, Manets, Hepworths, Henry Moores...need I go on? I don't think I have seen such a quality collection outside of Europe! A MUST SEE!",DavidHBlair

50,Great art in a small place,"The Norton Simon, small as it is, is chock full of masterpieces, and the wonderful thing about such a small and choice museum (think the Frick in New York) is that you can see everything in just a few hours.

50,Excellent collection,"This is a wonderful spot to see just about any great artist you can think of from the last 600 years. A super collection - not too big or overwhelming like the Getty can be.

Depending on your museum-going style, you could see the museum in 90 minutes or spend an entire day here, lingering over each work of art in your favorite collection. There is a lovely little garden (this gets closed if it is/has been raining as the paths can get quite muddy - just know in advance so there is no disappointment) - There is a little outdoor café with tables situated along the side of the pond and it is a lovely place to relax with a coffee and a treat when you need to rest and absorb what you've seen.They have a well-stocked gift shop with a nice selection for a smaller museum.

The paintings are the draw, European and wonderful. Then you wander and discover the excellent south Asian and Indian art, and you see this collector go beyond the Western traditional and into new areas of interest, with great results.Then you might take in the new designs by Frank Gehry to make the interior work better, and this too is pleasing. Nancy Goslee Power's gardens are a complement to the museum's interiors, but very different.Then you might see an exhibit of recent and contemporary work the museum received dating to the 60s, which is one more surprise.So it is a small place, the opposite of an encyclopedic institution like LACMA. What it does have, though, is the best of things Simon collected. It reminds me of the Frick.",VeniVidiFrui
50,A really important art collection but manageable to see!,"This is a very manageable museum to see. The impressionist collection is excellent and includes a complete set of Degas' sculptures -- the only first casting in the world made directly from Degas' wax figures. There are wonderful Renaissance and later European masterworks: Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Rembrandt, Memling, to name just a few. What is most unusual is that almost every painting is a gem. There is very little of ""ordinary"" art here. Walk outside before the end of the day into the sculpture garden. It is not large, but is beautifully conceived and filled with masterpieces of modern art. If you have time, go downstairs to see the famous collection of art from India.

There is so much of this collection in storage that what is on exhibit today you will have fresh art work to view on subsequent visits. If you have a large group, do request a docent. Parking is free. There is a lovely garden in the rear with food and drinks available along with many sculptures. My grand daughters, from 5 to teens, love to take a sketch book and draw their favorite statues or paintings. It seems to me private collectors like Norton Simon have the better of the artist's work very often - rather than documenting all phases. A superb European collection from the 14th through the 19th century - not to be missed. Military and children under 18 are free.

Allow 2-3 hours, or come back several times. And stroll through the sculpture garden when you visit the outdoor cafe.",BogeyPeter
40,The best museum in Pasadena,"Although many are not aware, there are actually dozens of museums in Pasadena, but Norton Simon stands apart from them all. The collections of this museum are on par with what you might see at a New York Met or MOMA or even the Louvre, all of which I have been to at least once in my life, so walking through the halls and exhibits of this medium-sized museum felt as if I had been transported to another time and place and that is the magic of this museum. You can spend just one hour here and find yourself completely immersed in culture from the European impressionism to classical Chinese paintings to culturally-relevant American pop art. The sculptures in the garden make for a nice stroll.If you are only able to visit one museum in Pasadena, this would be the MUST SEE museum.",mrmiguelito

Best gallery in LA (perhaps even the whole West Coast).,Taymar
50,Still one of the great museums of the world,"Walking through the beautiful sculpture garden is always a treat. The atmosphere is soothing and the work is always world class.Nothing in any museum beats the modernist/impressionist wing that holds some of the world's best paintings by masters. The Van Goghs (self portrait, mulberry tree, and his mother's portrait) are some of the best in the world. From Manet to Money, Picasso, Klee, Kandinsky, Nolde, Tamayo, Braque, Mondigliani, the list goes on and on. Many museums have works by these masters, but the paintings that Mr. Simon amassed are simply the BEST OF THE BEST. Museums like the Hammer (who had scads of money) have many of the artists, but NOT the BEST works by far. Simon had the best.Don't miss the extensive Asia collection on the other side of the museum which has some of the most peaceful spots to meditate of any museum I know. Not to mention the stunning Rodan's that greet you upon arrival in the front.",CayeBoy
10,RUDE RUDE RUDE,"Unless you're over 50 and have NO KIDS this will be the only way to enjoy this place. The art collection is vast and the outside ground beautiful. The had Dali and Van Gogh. Too bad all that beauty is over shadowed by the rudeness of the staff. They keep a close eye on kids and make a point to be very forward and blunt if they even think your kids are misbehaving. My kid wasn't running around or touching anything and just because she kept walking fast to each art work I was told that my child needed to stop horsing around. So what she was excited! She loved painting and her favorite was Andy Warhol. Seriously, If there are children misbehaving, the parents shouldn't have taken the kids to the Norton Simon Museum in the first place. It's the parents fault not the kids for lack of better behavior. After being told 3 times for my daughter to contain her excitement, I told her we needed to leave. I even told the guard by the door that they were rude and expected visitors to be prude and quiet as in a funeral. I WILL NEVER take my child or myself to this museum again. If you have kids I suggest the Getty Museum or La Brea Tar Pits, with plenty of children's activities to do there. You and your family will enjoy the day. I was so disappointed in this place and after all the recommendations I heard, never again.",cloudb310

40,"Great collection, lovely garden, not super baby-friendly","I'm a local and I've been to the NS twice. The collection is a nice size and quite impressive. It's a moderate sized museum without the name recognition of, say, the LACMA or the Louvre, but they have Gaugins and Riveras and Van Goghs etc. The sculpture garden outside is just lovely. BUT.BUT apparently it is one of those museums that doesn't allow you to put babies in back carriers. I guess this is a thing? I've gone to a zillion museums in my life, but I only just had my first baby, so I never knew it was a thing before.Long story short, baby gets fussy in his stroller and is too heavy to wear in front carrier, so I brought a back carrier. Not only did the guards refuse to let me put him in the back carrier, but they were huge jerks about it. Guard #1 asked if I wanted to check with her manager, to which I said yes (hoping the manager guard might cut me a break), but he just marched up and said, ""You wanted to talk to me?"" and then stonewalled me with the ,""Sorry, it's a rule,"" response.I get it. I get that they're concerned people with backpacks, back carry babies, will turn around and accidentally knock into some art. Or maybe the baby will reach out and grab something when you can't see it? But to that second end, why allow children at all? I just felt like, it was 5 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon, there were about 10 patrons left in the museum and a zillion guards. Maybe tell me not to do it next time, and cut me some slack this time, and let the guards just keep an eye on if I get too close to stuff? Instead it was more like a person being excited to wield the small amount of power he has, this time to a woman with a screaming 6 month old who was just trying to get out of the house and enjoy the cool air and the pretty art collection with a friend.Honestly, I was so shaken by it, that when the baby needed his bottle I hid in the bathroom stall with him because I figured I'd get yelled at again for having liquids in there. It should go without saying that the bathroom has no nursing facility or area at all, so I'm guessing you are supposed to go outside to do that?I will say the 'no backpacks' rule is listed on their website, but the back carriers thing is kind of obscurely mentioned (eg it doesn't say, no back BABY carriers, so it's easy to miss that that is what they mean by carriers or you're supposed to deduce from backpacks.Anyhow, bottom line, it's a beautiful and nicely curated museum, but they aren't very baby-friendly and most of the guards I encountered weren't interested in being helpful, which is a shame because it's left quite a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't want to have.",Heather H
50,"Free first Fridays, joined in support!","The first time I visited the Norton Simon museum was on a first Friday of the month, and it turned out to be free! The show was Hiroshige: Visions of Japan. Drawn from the museum's extensive Japanese woodblock-print collection, the exhibit featured 175 prints by Utagawa Hiroshige (1797-1858). So I joined on the spot to support this fine museum, and saw this exhibit about 5 times, bringing a different friend as my guest each time. This is a fabulous private art collection housed in an intimateThe museum is located at 411 W. Colorado Blvd. in Pasadena on the corner of Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevard at the intersection of the Foothill (210) and Ventura (134) freeway. It's in downtown Pasadena, with easy freeway and surface street access and free and ample parking.As you exit the parking lot and walk up the entrance steps, several of Rodin's sculptures greet the guests, but walk around the whole building for some surprises. Pass through the museum's lobby and exit to the large garden, surrounding a pond with bog plants, lilies, and often, a family of ducks or geese. Each section of the garden has its own theme and seasonal specialties. A circular stroll around the pond yields sculpture but also each significant plant is labelled, so you get your botany lesson too. http://www.nortonsimon.org/gardenInside, intimate rooms featuring 14-16th century art, 17-18th, 19th and 20th-contemporary art (a lot of Degas sculptures too) and sculpture. There are also rooms with Asian art and prints. You might take in just a room or two or the whole museum, depending on your time allowance.I often bring a friend for lunch - I can bring in one guest with my membership - and the museum is less than 10 minutes from my work. We view one room or section, have lunch, then return to work, refreshed and inspired.As a member, I look forward to the member's receptions held several times a year. Built around a special exhibit, or a preview of a loaned treasure, these evening receptions with lite refreshments (by the Patina Group) and wine are an elegant introduction to a prospective member, or a treat for a friend.Recent reception previews of exceptional art included Johannes Vermeer's Woman with a Lute c. 1662-63, Vincent Van Gogh's Self Portrait 1889, and Hans Memling's Portrait of a Man c.1470-75. Recent collections featured at a reception include Beyond Brancusi, contemporary sculpture of 16 different artists, and Significant Objects - The Spell of Still Life - 17th and 18th century still life paintings.I have the row of the reception invitations, the front of which is a work of art from the special showing, on my wall at work. They inspire me when I can't get out to the museum.So whether you have just an hour to spend, or an afternoon, you'll enjoy a visit to this museum. Admission is $10, but if you join, you get free headphones ($3), a quarterly magazine, and invitations to lectures, movies, and the wonderful evening receptions.If you are a local or visiting Pasadena for the Rose Parade, a football games or just some southern California tourism, add the Norton Simon to your itinerary. It's the #1 Tripadvisor attraction in Pasadena.A plus, not like many larger museums is the hassle-free free parking just steps from the museum, plus comprehensive indoor and outdoor exhibits. Oh, there's also a nice outside cafe with shaded tables just outside too. And a great museum store, too. 12-6 p.m. except Fridays, 12-9 p.m. Closed Tuesdays.

This is a collection that is forever new and interesting-- the number of Cezanne paintings alone would make it a destination, but there is so much more, the Dutch paintings, including several Rembrandt's too would justify any visit, not to mention the wonderful oriental sculpture collection on the lower floor. Give yourself at least 2 hours. An added benefit is the free parking, simply inviting you to visit.",oborozuki
40,Impressive...but expensive,"The Norton Simon Museum is a must stop if you are anywhere near Pasadena, CA! The collection of Impressionist artists is truly amazing, with a very good study of Degas. The museum is on the small side - but you would still need at least 4-5 hours to take really view the works both inside the museum and outside in the sculpture garden. And therein comes my 4 versus a 5 rating. The cost for adults is $10 per visit, not optional. The average person can spend about 2 hours max in a museum if you really want to digest the art. So you would ideally need 2-3 visits to really enjoy the Norton Simon - which would translate to $30 per adult over 18 years of age. A little pricey for someone on a travel budget when many museums are free or accept a voluntary donation. I was also a little off put by the ""shushing"" of people talking (normal voice) by the museum guards. Engaging and talking about the art in a museum is one way to gain different perspectives on a work of art, in other words expands your enjoyment and understanding. Even with the cost and ‘shush’ factors, I know I found a few new 'favorite works' to add to my list and would go back on my next visit to explore more!",SullyGirly
50,Wonderful for children,"I brought my 5 grandchildren here, ages 4 - 12, when they had a free children's workshop & we had such a good time! We were taken on a small group tour of works of Van Gogh by docents who were very willing to answer questions, then went to a workshop downstairs where the children made collages & colored pictures of Van Gogh. I didn't think it would be engaging for all of them, but it was! There were many exhibits there that were interesting for the children - not just paintings: statues, artifacts from other countries, ancient carvings, etc. We paid admission to the museum, but the workshop was free. And there are free family days every month or two, when there is no charge for the museum at all! There's more info about the all this on their website under ""Family & Youth"". There are also places outside where you can picnic or buy lunch.",Colleen H
50,Impressive Collection,"We had limited time and chose the Norton Simon over the Huntington because of its proximity to the Wrigley Mansion. We are so glad we visited this museum. They have an extensive collection of Degas sculptures as well as his paintings, Corots, and many other Impressionist paintings, Rodin sculptures, Dutch masters, Rubens, Boticellis, Guardis and many, many more. We didn't visit the contemporary collection because we didn't have much time, but it's not our favorite genre either. I was extremely impressed with the organization of the museum as well as the extensive collection. I was disappointed in the gift shop though. We collect Christmas ornaments and shot glasses, and they both would have been appropriate to sell here.",Kay M
50,I Love This Museum,"We went to this museum twice during our visit to southern California, as our time permitted it. I loved seeing the exhibit of Impressionists up close and personal. Such a treat! It's a small museum, but lovely. The statuary in the entrance and garden is wonderful. We had lunch at each visit in a lovely setting with a lily pad garden.",MarriedMay18
50,Very Nice,"I went on first Friday 6-9Pm for the free entry of the month, the parking is also free. I was surprised this is the best museum in Los Angeles county. I joint the museum tour for Egar's collection. That was great. the sculpture garden is fabulous. I also rent the audio tour, it was worth three dollars. I didn't like the downstairs exhibits.",kpbsrs

Art is arranged on the main level in chronological order, indicating the schools they represent from midieval to modern. Downstairs holds special exhibits and Simons private collection of Indian and Eastern art. There is also a lovely garden with outstanding statuary, a good bookstore, and a small cafe. Wonderful concerts are held monthly in the summer. a real find for the serious art lover.",suz91101

40,Unique collection in intimate setting,"The relatively eclectic assortment of really top-rate classical and impressionistic art at the Norton Simon is pretty special, and they have interesting programs (art, usic, history, etc.) in their auditorium as well as in their sometimes-themed tours. Nice lunching outside in the garden, too!",drfertig
50,Always a nice museum to visit!,"Featuring a lot of incedible paintings from different eras, a vast collection of Indian and SE Asia arts, an enviable collection of paintings from Degas.Free guided trip is also very helpful in gaining deeper understanding of each painting.The garden itself is another treat with lily pond , surrouned by sculptures of Henri Moore!Long drive from Lake Forest to Pasadena is well justified!",EricLo

50,Best collection of Dega paintings in US,"The collection of Degas sculptures, pastels, and oils is amazing. Also you can see original Van Gogh's and Rembrandt's during your visit.

50,Worth A Trip to Pasadena,"This is a great museum. Lots of impressionist/post-impressionist art, a beautiful sculpture garden, perhaps the best collection of Asian art on the west coast; the uncrowded space, use of light, as well as wonderful facilities make this well worth a visit. Take a break while there and enjoy a gourmet meal by the Lilly pond.",camusfan
50,an amazing collection of art,"Norton Simon was an industrialist who didn't go to art museum until in his 40s. He then got passionate about art and started compiling a world-class collection. A beautiful, rich collection in a lovely setting.",toni88Pasadena_Ca
50,Perfect in Size and Content,The Norton Simon is wonderful in both size and content. It is big enough to stay occupied for hours but not so big as to overwhelm visitors. The art collection is one of the best on the West Coast even though the museum does not share the same notoriety as the Getty or LACMA. It is easy to find and park. The location next to Old Town Pasadena makes for great alternative activities when you have had enough museum time. This is something you do not want to miss if you travel to Pasadena from any distance.,HPH360
50,First-rate museum,"The Norton Simon is a must if you love art or just want to spend a pleasant afternoon in a great space and small garden. The garden (including beautifully incorporated sculptures and a pond) is a wonderful place to stroll, sit and read or a have a small bite at the tree-shaded tables of the cafe; however, you do hear freeway traffic. The collection has excellent 20th century European works including Van Gogh, Degas, Picasso, Klee, Matisse and iconic works from other centuries. The Asian collection (mostly sculptural pieces from India and SE Asia ) rivals the European. Sometimes i just come here to sit and read amidst the oaks and Rodins leading to the entry.",100lat
50,Beautiful Surroundings,"Great art, beautiful surroundings. Many gems in all areas of this intimate museum. This place is perfect for an afternoon outing, out of town guests, and is wheelchair friendly. Bring a lunch or purchase something at the snack stand and eat by the lily pond.

50,"Smaller Museum, Excellent Collection","The Norton Simon museum is a gem by any measure. If you're a fan of 20th Century art, they have a terrific collection that is easy to absorb, not too crowded, not overwhelming in size.

50,A top notch museum,"This is a great way to spend a couple of hours as a couple or with older children. The permanent exhibits are beautiful.

There is a rich collection inside with paintings by Van Gogh, Goya, Canaletto plus sculptures by Robin. The nice part is that there seems to be something for almost all artist tastes since the collection is so diverse. If in Pasadena (or Los Angeles) take the time to check it out. Being a local i get down there at least once or twice a year.",Warner L
30,"A Good, Not Great, Museum","As a Pasadena resident I have been here many times. It's a smallish museum with an interesting permanent collection and special exhibits throughout the year.

The have a copy of the famous Rodin Little Ballerina and some European Masterpieces. My favorite was Ruben's St Ignatius which originally came from Gesu church (the main Jesuit church) in Rome. An important Rembrandt and then some. Worth to visit if you're visitting Pasadena or to compliment your other visit to local museums like the Getty.",Argonaut72

We went on a Saturday afternoon and we were able to take our time admiring their work , there were no lines and everyone on the staff was very friendly . We had a relaxing lunch in the garden overlooking the picturesque lily pad pond. Beautiful museum and a great day!!",karen1818
50,Wondeful way to spend an afternoon,I was amazed at the breadth and depth of the collections here. They had a huge collection of Degas - both bronze and painted works. Other major Impressionists were also well represented here as were other major European artists such as Rembrandt and Asian and Indian works.We especially enjoyed Rodin's massive Burgers of Calais which confronts you right as you enter this lovely museum - through their sculpture garden..We loved the outdoor cafe overlooking what seemed to be Monet's Givery waterlily pond. It was all so peaceful and beautiful. Nicely stocked gift shop was a great final touch. Admission price was nominal.,Becca U

Massive Degas bronze and works collection and lower level dedicated to Indian (India) art. Burgers of Calais by Rodin welcome you as you enter. Totally a great place to visit.,Ralff
50,This Museum Snob Loved the Norton Simon!,"This was a spur of the moment trip this afternoon and we loved this place. I admit to some snobbery when it comes to art museums in the US. There are only a handful that can satisfy my European urge.I mostly wanted to see the three Rembrandts and other art of that era. I was so pleasantly surprised to find some by Renoir, Mort, Pissaro, Degas, To name just a few. We were there about 2-1/2 hrs and didn't even touch the lower floor with the Asian art. We enjoyed strolling the grounds, seeing The Thinker by Rodin (as well as other works by him). Even the quick sandwich at the outdoor cafe was tasty and well presented.Great way to spend a few hours pretending I'm in Europe!",ehbien

50,The little Louvre in Pasadena,It was a pleasant surprise to find this museum. I was just looking at where I can bring my kids this school break. Great collection of paintings and sculptures from as early as the the 14th century. The kids loved going around the Sculpture Garden. We came in on a Thursday and they had a brief guided tour and painting activity for the kids.,tameia
50,Wonderful varied collection of art.,"I was very impressed with the setting,free parking and accessible location.More importantly,the collection of artwork and sculptures equals any of the smaller excellent museums in Europe.I was especially impressed with the number of Degas sculptures on display.",Lynnmaui
50,Fantastic collection in great surroundings,"The museum is well worth a visit, with a surprisingly good collection of art through various ages. Highlights would be the collection by Degas, Van Gogh & Raphael. The garden is worth some time, with great planting and pieces of sculpture.The cafe in the garden is very reasonably priced, too.",roosterza
50,Out of the way but worth the trip,"Though people go for the ""name"" pieces; but this museum has a fantastic, diverse collection and is so much easier to get around than the other museums in Los Angeles. Take the time to visit Pasadena and see this little gem!",Balfour S

Their collection compares with some of the great museum of the world. Don't miss this if you love art.Heck, if you want to just be able to say, ""I saw a Rembrandt in person"" go there. The grounds are quite beautiful too. You could easily spend a lazy afternoon there.",fredfx

50,Jem of a museum,"This museum is small enough to physically cover in a single visit and packed with enough one-of-a-kind, amazing pieces of art to blow your mind. The Asian galleries are gorgeous, the setting is lovely--this is a do not miss museum if you are in the area.",LisaSanDiego_CA
50,Inspiring and Peaceful,"Everyone first response when I said I was visiting L.A. was ""The Norton Simon, don't miss it!"" so I put the Norton Simon on my list without even knowing what it was. It turned out to be a memorable day spent both inside this architectural gem and outside as well, in its stunning gardens and among its wonderful sculpture collection.The collection is super. The collection features the expected and the unexpected. Drenched with color and movement, the unexpected drew me into a room with a trio of what turned out to be large Sam Francis paintings: Basel Mural I along with two fragments of another Basel Mural (III). I quite enjoyed the presentation, being surrounded by them, as much as I enjoyed the story of a painting being damaged and reconfigured into the fragments.The walking path around the pond is refined enough for art but there are sections that feel wild enough to give you an idea that you are in the California countryside, though the traffic noise just outside the walls reminds you that you are not. It's a great destination. Plan to have lunch at the pond-side bistro cafe.I planned to take public transportation from the Staples Center but ended up sharing a cab. The cab was a splurge ($40 total) but took less than 20 minutes.",bravo-cinzia
50,Little Museum with Big Works of Art,"This tiny museum is one of those little gems that you hope to come across with every visit to a museum. Nestled in a beautiful building in Pasadena, California, the Norton Simon has many Picasso's, several Rembrant's, many Van Gogh's and countless other treasures.Once the private collection of industrialist Norton Simon and now on view for everyone to see, this collection is eccelectic in that there is no major concentration of art of a certain timeframe. It is a collection of art spanning several centuries and several genres. You will like what you see. The museum has several early Van Gogh's before he developed the famous ""S"" curve strokes showing emotions that he used in his later paintings. It also has two very famous Van Gogh's that do have the profound ""S"" curve. Oh to have only known Van Gogh when he was out in the fields painting in Arles!!There is much to see at this museum. It will take you a good 3-4 hours if you stop to read each note next to each picture. The note are worthwhile to read. It sets the picture in its timeframe in the world. If you are short on time, then just see the upstairs and the outside gardens. If you have several hours, visit the downstairs as well.The gardens in the rear are modeled after the gardens of Monet at Giverney. You will not want to miss viewing them and visiting the sculpture piceces of Rodin, Degas, etc that are in the gardenAll in all, a visit to this museum is incredibly worthwhile. Please note that unlike other museums which open at 10AM, this one doesn't open until noon. The entrance fee is incredibly reasonable at $10.00 for adults and $7.00 for seniors. Don't miss this museum on your visit to California. The museum gift shop is also great!",Myra G
50,Don't miss the Thinker by Rodin on the side of the building,This is a super museum. The collection of Degas is exceptional. I really enjoyed a couple of Rembrandt paintings (which usually do not say much to me). The visit takes about two hours. We took a break to have lunch in the outside garden. The pool was with flowers and it was spectacular. The collection of Indian art is big and rather interesting. If you do not have the time: just drop by the entrance and enjoy the 6-8 bronzes by Rodin. Only thing that was a little bothersome: most paintings have a glass cover and some paintings were difficult to see due to the reflection on the glass.,Luis R
50,"A gem of a museum, well worth the road trip","We drove up from West Hollywood specifically to visit this museum and were so glad we did. This museum is truly a gem. The collection is eclectic with a nice mix of most periods, but an absolutely phenomenal collection of Degas, unlike any I've seen elsewhere in the world. I was blown away by that. The Impressionists (Monet, Van Gogh) were also amazing as was the Dutch collection.The sculptures in and around the building were wonderful and the garden area is truly delightful with its waterlilly pond and geese.I'm so glad we took the time to visit. It's a manageable (not overwhelming) museum experience in a beautiful setting.",amybatt

50,the best and moving museum in the world!,"My visit to the Norton was extraordinary. Beginning with the guardian who invited me to come closer to the statues by Rodin, exhibited at the entrance, to admire them better, although I was trampling the lawn. Continuing with the celebration of the ticket man when he learned that I was from Naples, as he remembered his lovely visit to Vesuvius. The works are very very very impressive, from Van Gogh to the movingly beautiful Degas bronze of young dancer, from Picasso to the beautiful Chagall, from Modigliani to Monet. And there are even detailed written explanations. The custodians, on request, provide explanations or, spontaneously, approach visitors to ask if the museum is to their liking. I was very moved!",GdN80100

It was really something to see all those masterpieces up close, in person. Names you only hear about - Picasso, Van Gogh, Monet - right there in front of you. Amazing when you think of how old these painting are. Very interesting seeing how art has evolved over time. Definitely a must see!",KatPlay

50,Superb Collection,The grounds and gardens are lovely. What is most amazing is that the collection represents the life's work of a dedicated collector.

50,Once Is Not Enough,"This is one of those wonderful museums that should be visited more than one time. Since it houses such a large collection, they revolve the pieces, so each visit is a new experience. Each masterpiece is given plenty of space and the lighting is perfect. Furthermore, I've never been when it's too crowded. I like the size of the Norton Simon - it isn't overwhelming or exhausting. Don't forget to browse in their great book store.",Linda C
50,Simply the best,"The Norton Simon is my favorite museum in the LA area, and that's saying a lot considering we have LACMA, the Huntington Library, the Hammer, and MOCA. NS is a gem where you can see world-class artwork from Degas, Matisse, Vangogh, Rembrandt, Manet, and Picasso along with a tremendous collection of ancient Asian art. The artwork is of such high caliber that many of the pieces can be found in general art history books.This is a must see for anyone who enjoys 19th and 20th century art.There is a quaint refreshment area where you can get coffee and a light meal.",AJMJGS
50,Art and Art,"Even if you've never been to the museum, you've probably see it on TV, it's in the background when the Rose Parade turned onto Colorado Boulevard. But don't stop there, come see the art inside. Classic and modern art inside and sculptures outside.",Kenneth L

50,"Masters of Art, Accessible in Pasadena","We spent the afternoon there -- and were delighted in the quality of the art, pleasantly curated in a museum that isn't overwhelming... easily seen in a day. (With our two teenage daughters, we went fairly quickly -- under 18 free!)Having been to the Vatican, Louvre, NY Met, and the British Museum all within the last year, we were happy to see the same masters here in Southern California. (Who knew?) A wonderful array of Impressionists paintings, Degas Sculpture, Dutch masters, and Italian Renaissance artists were our favorites. There's also an extensive collection of Asian art downstairs - mostly Hindu bronzes, which if you're into that, is impressive.Make sure to enjoy the pond area with the sculpture garden-walk. We ate at the cafe -- no complaints for museum food, the choices were good at about $10 per person. Skip the free 30 minute film unless you want to know more about Norton Simon: It's named ""The Art of Norton Simon"" but it's really more of a short biography. Interesting but unnecessary to enjoy the museum.",Brian C

Very welcoming, lovely selection of art that seems to go on and on, great gift shop. I need to go back because we only were able to see about half. The best part is that they're open late on Fridays (9pm) and there's lots of free parking. Don't forget: students with ID are free!",kcdenman
50,peaceful perfection,My favorite museum in the LA area...a spectacular private collection assembled by the late actress Jennifer Jones for her industrialist husband. An entire room of Degas and many impressionist. The Asian collections are gorgeous. There's a beautiful garden as well. Always take out of town visitors there.,janieB1123
40,Outstanding collection; welcome needs work,"First the good news: this beautiful small museum boasts an extensive collection well worth a special trip. Norton Simon's riches were matched by his taste: every work was clearly purchased for its quality, not simply for the star power of the artist's name. Impressionism and post-impressionism are a particular strength here, to the point where I was hard-pressed to leave those galleries and explore the rest, which are none too shabby (my personal favorites include a powerful late Goya, a self-portrait from Rembrandt's middle years and a rare Corot portrait, ""The Cicada""). After an hour and a half of rapt exploration, I thought I'd seen the place and realized the next day that I had missed the museum's 2-th-century holdings entirely.I really wanted to give this museum five stars, but there's a sticking point. When it comes to the visitor experience, this museum has some work to do. We arrived to find the parking lot clogged with circling cars, while numerous attendants stood around doing nothing except telling us where we weren't allowed to park. Not a mention of where we'd be welcome to park. Only with assertive questioning were we able to elicit the essential information: the lot was full (why no sign to that effect?) and we would have to park on the street. In short, not the warmest of welcomes.Because we arrived after 2, when most museum cafes shut down, we brought sandwiches from Ralph's down the street, hoping to find a bench on the grounds. We were not allowed to finish our lunch because--surprise!--the cafe was open and has a lock on all food consumed at the museum. To his credit, the head of security listened to our complaints about the quality of the welcome and refunded our money. So what does this mean for you? Arrive early. Know that the cafe will be open for lunch--or buy your less expensive lunch at Ralph's and find a park bench somewhere. Most important, allow plenty of time for enjoying this stellar collection.",Gelatifan
50,Jewel Box Visual Delights,"This is a small museum, but few collections give you such a diverse array of 17th-20th Century western paintings. All the masters are here, in spacious galleries. Of special interest is the Rodin sculptures near the entry and the Asian gallery downstairs. Such a remarkable collection assembled by on man over three decades! This is a great afternoon, which can include lunch the courtyard from a limited but well executed menu. Get there early to find parking.",Hencat
40,Delightful main floor,"European art is my favorite, and the main floor had some gems, well-worth the excursion here. I understand that the garden art was terrific, but I did not know that until someone mentioned it on the way home. The cafe had reasonably good food too.",orcasgal
20,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing this museum. I almost always rent the audio guides in museums (I am a member of the Metropolitan Museum in NYC and do so there) but when I tried to rent the $3 tour, I was asked to leave a ""photo id"" i.,e., a driver's license. In this day and age, no way was I leaving a driver's license at a museum's front desk. I have never been asked to do this before and was quite annoyed at the request. Turned me off to the whole museum which in any event was smaller than I expected. Walked around the sculpture garden and left within a half hour. Wished I had gone on a Friday night when it's free. That's what it's worth.",castlenv

40,Smaller but excellent Museum,"We were in Pasadena recently and went to the Norton Simon Museum. It does not open until noon so it is hard to see all if it in one day, if you like to read to extensive material by each painting. Very good collection of European Art, a lot of South Asia statuary which is not a biggie with us and we should have skipped it to see the contemporary works.The temporary exhibit was not all that interesting but I am a little jaded.The amazing part is that Mr. Simon put the collection together in only 30 years, astonishing what you can do with a good eye and LOTS of money.Certainly worth while to visit and easy to get to from the west end of Colorado Blvd.",Ted C
50,Just enough for an afternoon.,The Norton Simon Museum is a gem in the middle of a great city. There is a wonderful representation of art for all tastes. Special exhibits keep the viewing fresh and interesting. Try the audio tour for added enjoyment.,Calsey0078

50,A little treasure in Pasadena,"We went to the Norton Simon yesterday for see a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh. This is a great little museum, with great works by Picasso, Rembrandt, Manet, Monet, Modigliani, Van Gogh, Raphael, Degas...the list goes on. You can see everything in about three hours, and you can also watch Davis Guggenheim's movie about Norton Simon and his artwork. It's situated on a beautiful piece of land with an outdoor sculpture garden. And students and kids under 18 get in free. Loved it.",Susan S
50,Wonderful selection of diverse art,"This small, but vibrant, museum has a wonderful selection of art. The selections are eclectic, impressionists, abstracts, sculpture, etc. It is also not too large so it can be viewed in one day.

I was especially taken with the vast array of art from the Impressionist period including many critically important pieces of Edgar Degas (painting and sculpture). The staff was friendly and informative and mindful of the art collected. There is a great museum art shop, lovely garden and food source. Located at the western edge of Pasadena, the museum is easy to find and well-worth a visit.",elgreco251

50,Delightful museum in Pasadena,"With a nice collection of Rodin sculptures, some Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Degas and Cezanne and Monet, and at least one Diego Rivera, this museum would be a point of pride for any city. It's a small collection of excellent, bright pieces that are well lit and provide plenty of room for viewing.This museum would be a great pick for anyone who wants a brief museum tour of superb quality art in or around Los Angeles in 1- 2 hours.Very near to the corner where the Rose Bowl Parade passes the grandstands and a short walk from the scenic Colorado Blvd Bridge.",Tony B
50,Impressive private fine art collection,"The Norton Simon is one of the best privately-assembled collections I've seen. The collection is primarily limited to European paintings from the 13th through the 20th century (plus some sculpture and an Asian artwork collection).The highlights are definitely the Impressionist and early modernist works, including notable paintings by Monet, Degas and Van Gogh, and several terrific Picasso paintings. All of the other famous Impressionists are represented in the galleries, too. The remainder of the collection is more limited, with a couple of works from many major artists that are as good as any you'd see in the public art museums of most medium-sized cities for this type of art.The entire collection can be seen in 3-4 hours. The museum itself is rather non-descript from the outside, though very nice on the inside. There is also a landscaped outdoor patio and pond where the museum's cafe is located. It's a nice museum in all aspects, and the $10 admission fee is very reasonable for what you can see.",Brendan S
50,Great collection!,"Well worth a visit if you are in Southern CA. Great collection of Degas drawings and bronzes. Also, interesting collection of medeval pieces.",Knucklesmccarthy
50,Rich collection,I like this museum because it is just the right size and offers great selection of some of the most important pieces of art from the Impressionism period. I happen to like Picasso and Matisse and there were quite a few of them too. But they also have a lot of more traditional art including statues.,Olasek
50,Great museum,"Great museum, I suggest going in the evening if possible, plenty of parking and no crowds. Great collection of Degas sculptures.",evjr57
50,Excellent Adventure,The building is interesting from the outside and is well maintained. The art exhibits were wonderful. I like to look at the paintings from an oblique angle so I can see the brushstrokes better. The sculpture on the lower level was fascinating. I enjoyed this museum much more than I did the Getty.,loonessa

50,What a Collection,Norton Simon CLEARLY had GREAT taste in art. Artists from France are particularly well represented. The simple design of the galleries does not distract. Lovely sculpture garden with mature trees and shrubs is peaceful for walking or refreshment.,Martha M
40,Surprising discovery.,"I had not heard of this small art gallery/museum until I was at my motel looking for things that might be of interest in Pasadena. It has quite a good collection of paintings and statuary spanning the 14th to the 20th centuries. Most of the collection is European, but there is a decent collection of Asian statues as well. If you like Impressionism, a good part of the 20th century collection is from or related to that style.The museum includes a nice little statue garden as well as a small restaurant to grab a snack or drink and consume out in the garden area.The museum is easy to find and easily accessible.",Bryan G
50,Wow Who Knew,"Okay, so I lived in the LA area 30 years ago when I was in my 20s. Did I visit this place - NO. But now that my son is at Caltech I thought I'd use the afternoon to check this place out with a friend who is much more knowledgeable about art than myself.What a find! Even if you're not an art afficionado, you can delight in the beauty of this place. Great little store and restaurant too!",mtknash
50,Norton Simon Museum is a Must See!,"I was VERY impressed by the Norton Simon Museum's collection! It was so much more than what I thought it was going to be. Monet, Van Gogh, and so much more!

50,Truly outstanding collection,"If you are into impressionism, and enjoy sculpture, the trip to the Norton Simon Museum will be worth your time. This Museum Has some of the most outstanding pieces of sculpture by Degas and Rodin in the world. It is a great and eclectic collection of modern masterpieces!",Cocolo47
50,Memorable and Quality Pieces,The collection is more interesting and easier to view than the Getty. The sculpture garden is the best in Southern California. The Rodin's sat he entrance never fail to amaze me. The Moore Sculptures in the garden are very impressive and great because you can really approach them. I have taken young folks to this museum and the size is not overwhelming and keeps their interest.,Ralph H
50,Fabulous museum,"In common with other reviewers, we loved this museum. With limited time in the area we chose to visit this above the Getty Centre, both because we thought it would be less crowded and more ""bite sized"" as we quickly become overwhelmed by the larger, better known collections.The building itself is conducive to studying the art in peace and there are some fabulous pieces that warrant a lot of time spent on them. At no time did we feel impeded by crowds.There is a nice outdoor cafe area, a smallish garden dotted with interesting sculptures - and friendly staff who didn't make you feel as if they suspected you might make off with the Van Goghs!We got to it easily using public transport (the Metro then a 15 minute walk through Old Pasadena), which must be a rarity in LA.A lovely way to spend half a day.",JoMac110
50,A surprise gem,"Many pieces from the Baroque era. A must is to watch the movie about Norton Simon, an incredible story.",CaddieUSA

50,Great little museum a must see place.,"This is a small museum in Pasadena California which exhibits its very impressive permanent collection South East Asian Art, European paintings and some American art. European paintings and South Eastern Asian art are the forte of this museum.

There is also a very nice and interesting collection of sculptures in the garden of the Norton Simon Museum.",Farhad A
50,"Beautiful collection of fine art, large asian section","I visited this small but excellent museum twice, in 2000 and 2012. It is situated in Pasadena, nice neigbourhood, an oasis of art from Europe and Asia. It also displays special exhibitions, now regarding Still Life from diffrent perspectives and periods of time, event the contemporary one. Norton Simon museum has a very good reputation between art museums and art lovers for the quality of works put on display. There is a beautiful garden inside where you can relax after driving the crazy LA freeways. It is very fine but not overwhelming and huge so you do not get tired, you can concentrate on every piece of it.",Jana A
50,Dutch Masters and great sculpture gardens,"From Rembrandt's portraits to Picasso's wild sketches, , this elegant building house a terrific range of art.

30,Keep you hands and eyes inside the ride.,"An oasis in the desert of Southern California’s culture. A simple, delicate and interesting place to visit. They have wedged a variety of paintings and sculptures within a fraction of space granted to most museums. Don’t be fooled by the industrial exterior and Nano size parking place. The moment you enter, it seductively reveals more than you expected. Burrowing itself in to the earth below, the gold of oriental sculptures are discovered. Being spirited into the living room of the ancients. The casual observer becomes a participant in the “Dance of the Ages.” So intimate after you overcome the thousands of eyes looking at your every move and thought. Be aware you are being watch at every angle. The watchman are neither friendly or accommodating. I tried to get one to smile……..no way. Frankly, that bothered me the most. So observe the rules and ""keep all hands and eyes in side the ride"".",sl1953
50,A Must See Museum near LA,"The Getty museum is a must see just for its architecture alone but if you love 17th through 20th century art, you must go to the Norton Simon Museum in Pasedena which is actually closer from downtown LA than the Getty. If you love impressionisim, this is your place!! Degas lovers rejoice!Beautiful gardens as well and they have audio tours for BOTH adults and kids which is great to keep the little ones amused. Admission is only $10 bucks for an adult and free if you are a child.You will not regret going!",Anamaria P
50,A Small But Very Unique Museum,"This museum has a very comprehensive selection of the old masters. The downstairs newer SE Asia collection is one of the best in the US. After spending December 2011 in Northern and Southern India. and December of 2012 and January of 2013 in SE Asia, this collection represents some of the best from those areas. If you can not go to these areas than the museums collect is a very complete substitute.",RockwallTraveler
50,This is a must-see museum,All the super reviews on this museum are correct. The art selections are above and beyond many museum collections. Plan to spend four or more hours. The Garden Cafe has great food so one can spend a whole day looking at the art from all ages. The Norton Simon Foundation is to be commended on art selections.,dalichandler
50,Small but wonderful,"This is an art museum that won't overwhelm but will give you a good sampling of artists and examples of different kinds of art. The Degas collection is excellent. I'd recommend going in the afternoon because in the mornings on weekdays, the museum is often host to school groups, which can be quite noisy and disruptive to a calm perusal of the artworks. Or perhaps call ahead to see if a school group is scheduled for the day you wish to attend.",Puttermutt17
40,Time to Enjoy,Very Grateful that the Museum is there to share all its wonders with the public always come back feeling Lucky,NoCamper
50,"Small museum, Amazing Work","This is a tiny museum but it also has amazing work. It has several important works by everyone from El Greco, to Rembrandt to Van Gough. I remember the first time I visited, I was rounding a corner, and right in from of my eyes was the Adam and Eve diptych by Lucas Cranach the Elder. They also have the Ragpicker by Manet, one of the most important art works of modernism. There are several sculptures around the museum grounds, and in the different exhibits, in particular, there are works by Henry Moore, and castings of Rodin's Monument to Balzac, and the Burghers of Calais. (I think the also have the thinker)There is so much more here. If you are an artist and you make it to Pasadena, there is no excuse not to stop by. Just don't come hungry because the museum cafe (like all museum cafes) is very overpriced.",SionnanH

50,Small gem,"The Norton Simon is a small gem of a museum. Although you think you might easily cover it in one visit, the collection is so distinguished that I find I linger in one section. I particularly love the outdoor sculpture garden, including many Rodins, and the 19th and 20th century art. I'm afraid I tend to neglect the rest of the collection in favor of those. But the last time I was there, my friend and I explored the special exhibit on still lifes and also the 14th-16th century European art galleries and also had a really enjoyable experience. One time I rented the audio tour and it added to my experience of the 19th century art gallery. The discussions are lengthy so doing this would considerably lengthen your visit.",JoyceKing
50,A gem of a museum,"A visit to the Norton Simon is a lovely way to spend the day. The collection of art and sculpture is the perfect size to enjoy in one visit, with breaks in the beautifully landscaped garden, the cafe or the theatre (where you can see a film about Norton Simon or with Sister Wendy describing some of the works of art).The building, by Frank Gehry, lends itself to an orderly progression from room to room.There is a wonderful collection of impressionist art, as well as some excellent european old masters. If you are a fan of Rodin or Degas you will be particularly thrilled with the large collection of their works.The museum has an excellent and inexpensive ($3) audio guide and a free service to store bags, coats, etc. There is a bus stop right outside, as well as a car park.",Nomad65843395326
50,Really enjoyed this museum,"I hadn't been to the Norton Simon in a very long time and had forgotten what a gem this place is. One is greeted by multiple Rodin statues at the entry. A nice tone to start the visit. There is quite a good mixture of art, without trying to cover everything in every time period. The Indian sculptures were beautiful. For a sampling of great painters throughout the centuries there are Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Degas, Picasso, Kandinsky, and many others.The rooms are well lit with large skylights that let in lots of natural light. The sculpture garden outside has works ranging from Rodin to Serra to Moore and are nicely arranged so that they can be enjoyed from all sides.Parking is free, and the museum is easily reached from the freeway. Admission is only $10 per person; a bargain in Los Angeles.If you only have an hour, it would be easy to pick just one of the galleries and really study the art. With 3 hours, one can easily see the highlights inside and out.",MethosAdventures
50,great space to see the collection,I often visit the Norton Simon when I'm in So Cal. It's a very comfortable museum experience and doesn't try to be everything. This last time was first time I went downstairs to the Indian sculpture. My favorite part of it is the sculpture garden. This is a great place to recover from LA. I think of these grand Maillol's as friends.,Miriam F

We will be going back again and again.",Larry B

The permanent collection of modern art (Degas to Diebenkorn) is exquisite. It is rarely crowded, so you can take your time to absorb the art at your leisure. The museum also has a large permanent exhibit of religious art, if that's your thing, and a small but lovely sculpture collection outside where the Monet pond is located.

This is not about size -- the big museums, including MOMA, the Met, the Louvre, the Tate, they are all unique, but the Norton Simon has intimacy of scale, no crowds -- so that you can freely move around and actually enjoy viewing the paintings and sculptures, and it has a hugely impressive collection of masterpieces and lesser known works by well-known artists. Most of all, the Norton Simon has that special combination of being an important gallery and a friendly community museum. It is one of the great attributes of beautiful Pasadena.

50,Norton-Simon is highly recommended & good variety,"We liked the size & scope of the work. Many varied artists kept it interesting and the size and quality of the paintings was fantastic. They have the big names here & you can see them up close. They are not as ""fussy"" as when you visit the Getty Museum where you feel the secret service are policing you. The Norton-Simon also has an outdoor sculpture garden with a very large pond, many interesting plantings, walking path, small coffee shop for a break. We had some coffee after the first half of our visit on the patio & then toured the last of it, the Asian works which are downstairs. We probably stayed about 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Highly recommended. We recommend you make a day of it like we did. We also toured the other two art museums in Pasadena, the Pasadena Museum of CA Art (PMCA) & next door to that was the Pacific Asia Museum which is located in a private Asian style home that was later converted to the museum. It has art from Asia, India, & an island near Australia. If you go to the PMCA or Pac. Asia Mus. show your receipt the the 2nd one will give you half off.

(this might have to do with the slightly lower expectations I had prior to going to Norton Simon)I'd absolutely recommend it for families (they have a nice, albeit small, outdoor garden to walk around) and children, as well as a great off-the-beaten-path (not Getty, LACMA, etc) place to go by yourself, with a friend, or on a date.",JLM2009

He purchased the best of the best and it's all here, very accessible and glorious. Early Christian Icons! Lucas Cranach! Picasso! More Van Gogh's than you can shake a stick at! The Getty Center's art collection seems amateurish in comparison. The Asian Art at the NS is also first rate, and the garden is a little delight. The guards are generally agreeable and the films are helpful to orient yourself. The print take-away is a nice touch.

It is truly a world class art museum. The collection's highlights are a large number of European master works from several periods but a notable strength is the Impressionist works of Monet, Manet, Degas and Renoir.A bonus is the Asian collection which is also quite extensive with works from a variety of Asian cultures very well exhibited and organized.The museum is very well laid out in general and a few hours spent here is a must if you're visiting the area.",bccrab
50,Beautiful and Restorative Site,"The Norton Simon Museum is a respite (and I would even say restorative) from the hectic modern life (even that of the vacationer). The location is beautiful and civilized and capable of being seen in its entirety in one visit without wearing you down or out. The collection of art-smaller than the Getty- is of very high quality and imagination.Its European art collection-particularly the 19th and 20th century galleries -is tremendous-Rembrandts, Van Goghs and Picasso-and it appears to have a strong Asian collection in addition to a very good sculpture collection. Pasadena is a 20 minute car ride from downtown Los Angeles and your visit to this outstanding museum should be combined with a visit to nearby Old Pasadena which is a fantastic location for shopping, dining and maybe the symphony or other local cultural event. I live 10 miles away and I am far from an art critic, but if you are visiting LA, and especially if you are above 30-35 years old, consult this website and your travel guide and plan on a day trip to visit this Museum and old Pasadena.",jimboesq

50,MORE THAN JUST ART MUSEUM,"If you ever watched the Rose Parade on TV you have seen the black building in the background, but never knowing just what was really in there. As many people know this as an art museum, I say it's more than that. It's a walk into history, with so many of the paintings and art pieces showing a time period that no longer part of this world. It's a place in which one can sit sharing into color of an art and relaxing. It's a place that people in Pasadena seem to be very proud of. For me as a it was a place where I was able to escape the busy world and walk, look and sit outside along with my wife and enjoy a wonderful Sunday afternoon. Sure the great art work was there, but it was a place to enjoy life in a beautiful setting.As for the art work, I was over taken by the great art pieces that are displayed. I never knew that a Vincent van Gogh painting was there or even Picasso. It is a must see.",Mou2

Didn't have time to see it all which was a pity but saw the 19th and 20th century galleries and was amazed at the quality of the work - Norton Simon obviously had excellent taste. The sculptures are wonderful - in particular the Henry Moore's. Sadly it had rained earlier in the day so the garden was closed. We had a snack in the outdoor cafe - 99.9 times out of 100 thiswould have been fine here but we chose a chilly day!!",Bonestone
50,Maybe the most beautiful art museum setting in the world,"This museum sits in a garden with great statues all around it, and they feature the Burghers of Calais by Rodin and his Balzac on the front lawn and entry way. Inside you get views of the surrounding gardens and lawns between rooms, and the art includes many great Degas pastels, a set of lithographs by Picasso that show a bull done in about twenty styles of art from cave painting simplicity, to realist to cubist. It is like a history of Picasso and of Art. He started with the realist view, and kept simplifying until he arrived a something that looks like it is on the wall of a cave. Fantastic!!!!!!",Finnagain57

50,"Great art collection, and conveniently located if you're in Pasadena","Norton Simon was a multi-millionaire businessman who turned out to be equally astute in collecting art. By the time he died he had an astoundingly good collection, which he bequeathed to a museum -- it was originally the Pasadena Art Museum but through some confusing legal wrangling it ended up becoming the Norton Simon Museum. It's right on the western end of Old Pasadena so it's convenient to anyone who's in that part of town. It also has its own parking lot so you can either park or walk (or take the Gold Line light rail).Simon's tastes were eclectic from ancient art to modern art. The collection appears to be strong in Asian art, although I know very little about Asian art so I can't say for sure. But its European art collection is tremendous -- Rembrandts, Van Goghs, Picassos, etc. It has a good sculpture collection too, again including Asian art as well as being a possessor of casts of Rodin's The Thinker and The Burghers of Calais.Although the John Paul Getty had a ton more money and a larger collection, the paintings at the Getty are much lower in quality than the small but high quality Norton Simon collection. (I agree with the LA Times art critic who said there's only one masterpiece in the entire Getty Museum.)The Norton Simon Museum doesn't have the spectacular location or architecture of the Getty, but it's got better art and if you're in Pasadena it's great art that's right nearby.The museum has a small theater which shows a short documentary film about Norton Simon, made by the Guggenheim brothers (who also made ""An Inconvenient Truth"" and ""It Might Get Loud""); I highly recommend seeing the film too.",mkt_travel
40,Nice setting with some good modern art- open til 9 p.m. on Fridays.,"I recently visited the Norton Simon museum. I was tired from walking out in the sun in Pasadena. Besides the slightly over-zealous security detail upon entering the museum, it was really a great experience!I love modern painters such as Cezanne, Manet, van Gogh, and Gauguin and the Norton Simon museum has some good examples of these artists as well as an impressive collection of Rodin sculptures especially considering it's such a small museum. There is a lot of good 16th, 17th, & 18th century art which I, personally, am less interested in, though it is quite good.The grounds are pleasant, with a little pond and patio in the interior courtyard which thoughtfully connects the two upstairs wings of the museum so you don't have to back- track and you are allowed a little bit of fresh air and contact with nature before hitting the other side! The building is unassuming but really gorgeous in its simplicity. Brown tiles cover the exterior which has smooth, calming rounded corners. The interior was reworked by Frank Gehry in 1999.I spent a couple of hours and never made it downstairs to the Asian art collection, which gives me a great excuse to go back and take in some tranquil beauty. Actually, the sound of traffic is audible from over the berm in the garden but this reminder of the outside world didn't diminish my experience. Maybe it made me appreciate the peacefulness that has been achieved despite the proximity to the rush of L.A. traffic.",Ben H
50,Fantastic Small-Scale Art Museum in L.A. area,"A fellow academic colleague recommended that I visit this museum if I had time to see only 1 art museum while in the L.A. area for business in late March. He was right. The Norton Simon is an amazing collection of key artists, with strength in 19th century French holdings, and with an equally amazing collection of Asian art, especially religious sculpture in the lower level, developed by philanthropist Norton Simon in the second part of his life. The Museum is located at the edge of Pasadena. Carless tourists take note: it can be accessed from L.A. via the Gold Line train that goes through Union Station, and then it is about a 15 minute walk through the central district up to the Museum. If you drive, it is a fairly quick connection on the freeway, at least at midday, when the Museum opens. For those art lovers who appreciate a superb collection in a smaller space, this is the right place; a very different feel than the Getty or LACMA (a West Coast version of the NY Met). One criticism: the between-season options for on-site dining were limited to a casual snack bar with salads and sandwiches, which did not match up with the setting of the museum. The Museum is not far from the Greene House, another superb example of Craftsman architecture, which has specialized tours (I did not have time to visit) and appeals to art and architecture lovers.",Budgettravel55

In addition to admiring the usual big-name masters, we never cease to gain new appreciation for lesser known & underrated artists found at the Norton.We also enjoyed the renaissance-themed exhibit now on display which included the famed Memling's ""Portrait of a Man.""HINTS: Parking is free but limited--so its best to arrive early!

50,A very well done traditional art museum,"My wife and I visited here with another couple. First -- a caveat about the rating. Although well done, the Norton Simon is a traditional art museum. If you appreciate fine art you will find much here to nurture your soul. You can spend a great deal of time wandering through the galleries. If art is not one of your passions, you may find it ho-hum. Our friend's husband walked quickly through the various collections, then spent two hours reading on a bench by the pond in the outdoor sculpture garden while we took our time.The collection is perhaps the finest on the West Coast and certainly the equivalent of some of NYC's best (e.g., the Frick). Although small, it is diverse, both in terms of periods and countries of origin. It also has a very large sculpture garden as well as some interesting large sculptures around the entrance. For us it is a place we shall visit again when in the area.",redneckersson5
50,A Terrific Museum with Surprisingly World Class Collections of Great Paintings and Indian Art,"The late philanthropist Norton Norton Simon rescued this museum from mediocrity, transforming it into a spectacular asset for Pasadena. He rehabilitated the building which is now quite striking in its architecture with a lovely garden with light dining around a natural pool. The Indian art collection is superb. The permanent collection of French and other paintings by such icons as Van Gogh and Monet is varied enough to form a first class survey of classic painting. The sculptures by the entrance contain some of Rodin's finest. The museum is of a nice size so that even taking in the varied special exhibits it can be appreciated in one visit. At present there is a fascinating exhibit chronicling Southern California's preeminent place in the history of American print making. It has its own quite sufficient parking lots. All in all it is one of the highlights of a trip to Southern Californnia.",rossbacher

50,"Spectacular art collection and peaceful, beautiful sculpture garden","Norton Simon was a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist who had outstanding taste in art and it shows in this museum which houses his collection. I have visited several times, and usually allow myself just a couple of hours as I get ""museum overload"" after that, and that was just enough time for me to make it through one-half of the ground-floor which houses 19th and 20th century paintings. All of my favorite pre- and post-Impressionists of the late-19th or early20th century artists are there including Pissarro, Cezanne, Seurat, and of course Picasso (also Braque) as well as those I don't normally like as much such as Monet (everyone loves Monet as his paintings are very pretty) and many other 20th century artists too numerous to mention.I was especially pleased to see several works by Degas that went beyond the usual dancers (landscapes, portraits) and several superb works by Toulouse-Latrec.But there is a lot, lot more to this museum than the artists I've mentioned. Every single piece in that wing was breathtaking and distinctive, and the collection included works by artists from the same era that I had not heard of.Compared to the Getty or LACMA this museum is intimate and peaceful, as it is merely small or medium-sized, not huge. There are two floors and a theatre. This is a place that if I lived in Pasadena I would go back to again and again.If you're tired of being inside a museum and the grounds and sculpture garden weren't enough, drive a few miles west on the nearby 134 Freeway to Glendale and exit Western Avenue north to Brand Park which is a beautiful city park below the Verdugo Hills which have breathtaking mountain hikes above all the noise and hustle of the city.",DolphinD

It was a nice day and the museum has a great collection. I enjoyed the Impressionist paintings very much. The security at the museum was overbearing. They followed us from room to room and got much closer than security in any other museum I have been to. My nieces are adults and know how to behave in museums. I had read about it in other reviews so was prepared but it really affected our overall experience.When I purchased the tickets the person who sold them to us told my niece to stop leaning on the wall. She was not, I might add, touching or leaning on the wall.I probably won't go back because of the intrusive security.The outside gardens were interesting but the plants needed some care. It was kind of messy and in need of repair. I don't now if they had some weather issues or problems or whether that's the way it always is.They have a nice collection of art but the feeling in the museum is not friendly and accessible. I can't imagine what it would be like to take children to this museum.I believe that museums should be welcoming. This museum is not.

They also have a collection of Eastern (mostly Indian) sculptures. When I was tired of walking-standing, I sat in the cafe at the sculpture garden to enjoy the sun of California. You don't need to drive to get here. I took the Golden Line at Union Station to downtown Pasadena (a 20 minutes ride), and then walked about 1/2 mile to the museum, while window-shopping for Bentleys, Rolls Royces, Porsches and Audis along the way.

The garden stroll is peaceful and full of surprises and awesome design at every turn. There are places to sit as well. You will love this museum!",ChanteuseSimone
50,An amazing museum!,"If you're interested in art, this is a ""must-do,"" right up there with the Getty and LACMA. A beautiful collection with an impressive selection of Degas and Impressionists. The sculpture garden is small but beautiful. The outdoor cafe has a limited selection but I can't think of a better place to enjoy a glass of wine on a sunny afternoon!",DebrainDenver
20,"This museum hates children, which is so sad because the collection is great","We have taken our 5 and 7 year olds to museums all over the US, including lots of time in NYC. This was our 5th time here - and each time we vow never to go back. From the moment you step on their pavement the guards are attacking you and your kids. They literally stalk you around the museum. Our girls are better behaved than most adults, and yet they truly act in fear of their being there. It is a completely miserable experience for the adults and kids, and we have never experienced anything like it - not at the Huntington, LACMA, MOMA, the Met, the Frick, you name it! They ran an amazing kids program this Sunday - Manny the educator was truly wonderful - but the rest of the staff was completely miserable towards all the participants, and Manny. We could tell they couldn't wait for us to leave.We are so sad to experience this at the Norton Simon yet again. It is a lovely museum with a great collection right in our backyard, and we won't be back.",Ladiesmom
50,Splendid collection,"What an excellent collection, with a great variety from different periods and areas.",gail r
50,GREAT art in manageable-size museum,"Yes, yes, yes, go here! I've been to the Louvre, Prado, Uffizi and the Met, but this is a more satisfying experience. The art collection is at a very high level (e.g, Renoir, Rubens, Caravaggio, Van Gogh, Degas, Cezanne, Modigliani, Picasso, Kandinsky, Klee), so you can revel in the quality of the works, yet the quantity does not overwhelm. You don't get lost in room after room of displays.My husband and I skipped the great collection from South and Southeast Asia, choosing instead to see the special exhibit of Hiroshige woodblock prints downstairs. They were amazing! The 53 stations from Edo to Kyoto series and 35 views of Mt. Fuji series, plus views of Edo and individual nature pieces.The outdoor cafe overlooks a beautiful garden, which would be very restorative on a nice day. On our rainy-day visit, only 1/3 of the tables were available. Bonuses: free parking and guards keeping people from talking on cell phones.",GTLandis
50,"Beautiful, fantastic, cannot say enough!",Great museum in Pas. Don't miss. Lot's of great stuff. Things not to miss: 1) The outside sculpture gardens are awesome. Pleasant walkway with places to sit along the way. Looks like a nice cafe out there as well. 2) Students get in FREE! Might be a nice place to changeup the study location sometimes...bring your books and laptop and relax outside at the Norton Simon...,GlendaleCA
50,"Wow, we're in Pasadena...","This little gem of a museum is simply one of the many reasons L.A. is a visual Arts delight.Who would have guessed?Norton Simon has much to offer the Art lover. Baroque, Asian, modern... but for us, It is the large amount of Degas Modeles that amazed us. The small bronze Sculptures, which apparently Norton Simon owns and cast the pieces for us to view. It is a study of the human shape and its movements in daily activities brought to life.A current of exhibition of Hiroshige wood block prints is also available to view until January, 17 2011. A small garden is the perfect oasis to contemplate and ponder through the visions that will forever dance in your head.Take a spin from the hollywood walk of fame and saunter to Pasadena. Everything in L.A is a 45 minute drive. This one is worth the traffic jam.",bdt61
50,Hidden gem in Pasadena,"The Norton Simon is not as big as Getty or LACMA, both in terms of the size of its collection, the physical size of the museum, or in terms of how well known it is. No matter, the collection is wonderful - better than Getty and on par with LACMA. The East Asian sculptures located on the lower level stand out the most to me, especially the Bodhisattva Maitreya statue. Some similar stuff can be found at LACMA but there's nothing like it at the Getty which is basically focusing on European art.The Getty is almost more of an attraction for its architecture and the views of the city that it affords, than it is for its art. The Norton Simon would really be the opposite of that, IMHO. The exterior of the building looks a bit dated, and certainly the exterior architecture isn't that interesting. On the other hand, the inside of the Norton Simon is wonderful, and the interior renovations were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The museum grounds feature a very nice garden, built around a small pond and featuring several sculptures, as well as a small bamboo grove.",MachThree
50,Tip for budget travelers,"The art of Norton museum is well known so no point in my further elaborating on it. Get the audio guide for $3 as some labels are not extensive. The indoor garden and sculpture garden is small but pretty. Tip for budget travelers is diagonally across from museum on Colorado St is Ralph’s grocery store, which sells sandwiches for $6-8 and many salads besides all regular groceries and fruits. They have iron chairs and table in front patio so decent place to get inexpensive lunch; much cheaper than museum café and better food selection.",PULAOKHAO
40,"Eclectic, small, private collection",Some days you just don't want to be overwhelmed by a huge art collection. The Norton Simon offers a little bit of something from Renaissance to Contemporary with some Asian thrown in to boot. It is easy to spend a couple of hours and not realize just how much you have actually seen.,Peregrina651
50,Great collection of South/Southeast Asian art,"This museum is very easy to find if you're coming from the freeway, as it's right next to the intersection of two major freeways. However, keep in mind there is a difference between East Colorado Blvd and West Colorado Blvd. Not being familiar with the region, I didn't remember this and drove myself crazy trying to find it in the East Colorado Blvd region, which has the same range numbering as the West Colorado Blvd area. This was only because I was coming from the Huntington Gardens, but when I subsequently came to Pasadena again via freeway, this museum really stands out and is easy to find. Admission is $8.The collections consisted of: South/Southeast Asian, modern, contemporary, European, and American art. There are also two sculpture gardens, one with a contemporary theme (along with a cafe) and a South/Southeast Asian themed garden as well. The South/Southeast Asian art collection is extremely impressive, possibly the most expansive that I have ever seen in a single museum. The other collections were rather paltry in their offerings and unimpressive. All in all, I spent no more than two hours there, but it was a worthwhile drive.",san367
50,Spectacular,"Just visited the Norton Simon Art Museum today and have to say that I was blown away. Norton Simon, a wealthy businessman, accumulated a very large collection of works by a number of the European masters as well as a significant collection from the Far East.I wasn't expecting such a rich collection. This is a hidden gem equal to the Getty.",Greg C
50,Superb In So Many Ways,"This art museum is superb in so many ways-Renaissance paintings,Baroque Art,Dutch Master paintings,French Impressionist paintings,great sculpture,and a lovely garden with plenty of sculptings by Henry Moore(""King and Queen"")and Aristide Maillol. My favorite paintings at this museum were;Master of St.Cecilia's""Madonna and Child"",Guariento D'Arpo's altarpiece,Martin Van Heemskerk""s""Allegory of Nature"",Zurbaran's""Stillife with Lemons.Oranges,and Rose"",Rubens'""David Slaying Goliath"",Guido Cagnacci's""Martha Rebuking Mary"",Rembrandt's""Self Portrait"",Antonio Joli""s""View of Paestum"",Renoir's""Pont Des Art"",Monet's""Garden"",Armand Guillaumin's""Break of Day"",Matisse's""Odalisque with Tambourine,and Maurice Utrillo's""Place Du Tertre,Montmartre"".This museum is very special,so enjoy this Pasadena gem.",margatemensch2016
50,Great little museum,"My husband and I visited the Norton Simon Museum in February 2007. We only had about 3 hours to spend there, which turned out to be just about perfect. The collection of European artwork is interesting. There is also an area with Asian art. If it's a nice day, be sure to take a stroll through the sculpture garden.",Kirkland_Traveller
50,"Great Collection, Ugly Building!","The Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena is one of the most impressive medium-sized art museums in the western hemisphere. It's a ""must-see"" attraction on your next visit to the LA area. Altough the location (next to a freeway) is not ideal and the museum building is dated and unattractive, the artwork in the Norton Simon is incredible! Many of the European and American paintings are stunning! The staff is also very friendly and helpful, and the museum store is wonderful. Plan to spend at least two hours in the museum.",Resort22018
