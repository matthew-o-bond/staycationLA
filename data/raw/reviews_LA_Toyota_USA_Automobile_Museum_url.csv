50,Beautiful venue space!,Toyota always lets us use their Automobile Museum to host our high school banquet at no cost! Very fortunate for their awesome community service. Beautiful cars and very nice staff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pnitake
50,Great collection of Toyota Autos and Motorcycles,"The Toyota Auto Museum was a great place to have a fundraiser and also get a chance to check out the cars and Motorcycles.With Toyota leaving Torrance to Texas, the museum has closed. I understand that will not be opening a museum there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RealtorCarolG

50,Fun museum,This is a fun and neat museum. I heard it will be closing or may have closed since Toyota is leaving the area. It had historic cars in the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pank01
30,Better Hurry!,"I understand Toyota is closing (maybe moving?) this museum in late September 2017. I visited it in the evening for the first time as part of a larger private event in the building, where for one hour we could roam the museum. As I expected, all of the cars are Toyota brands, and the bulk of them are recent models we can commonly see on the streets. There are a very few 1950's era Toyopets, Toyota's early attempt at importing sedans to the USA. Most interesting were the collection of racing cars and pace cars. I was slightly disturbed by the lack of air conditioning in the room, and that the cars were stacked in side by side like a big tight car sales lot. There were some exceptions. Altogether, for me, once was enough, but I am glad to see it that once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rendahl
40,Historical vehicles,Small museum featuring some interesting Japanese vehicles from Toyota. Some old cars that you don't see around much anymore along with some race vehicles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rantablin
50,Great place to visit if you like Toyotas,"My son and I arrived late for our appointment to see the museum, but the staff cheerfully admitted us anyway and waited while we looked at the cars past their normal closing time. They even gave us a gift bag when we left! You do need an appointment to visit, but it is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lmmarley

40,Good Car Mememories,It was good to see the cars from the 60s and 70s in their I had own some of the same models others owned by friends. Remember my 1969 Toyota Corona 4 door sedan I bought used in 1978! It was good car for first car. I saw the trucks my friends had. Nice to see the restored cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FilAmfighter1
50,Toyota Museum,"My husband and I walked through the Toyota museum, did feel like they had any air conditioning but that maybe they didn't want to damage the upholstery in the cars. Each car on display had some history written on plaques. The museum had racing formula 1, NASCAR and lead cars used to start races.If you are old enough to remember some of the older cars, you can travel down memory lane. Hubby and I weren't old enough to remember Toyota's first trucks, but interesting to see the progression through the years. I really wanted the candy apple red sports car!If you have small children, they had a small area with toys and ride on electric car for kids. This I think made it a family event.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosen193
50,Fun and interesting place,"I was the emcee for an autism awareness event that also served to promote a business. Nice layout, decent size and of course the DJ/Emcee was fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8427JTmarkh
50,Bash,"Having grown up to be a massive petrolhead and everything Japanese I was lucky to find the museum first and foremost whilst on hold from the Uk. When we turned up on a Thursday and found it was closed but were informed to come back on the following Saturday as there was a corporate event. We turned up on Saturday and the staff were fantastic, I got to see a so many cars including very rare Toyota 2000GTs in the flesh, a true Toyota fan's wonderland. The only other museum is in Japan so well worth a trip if you're a Toyota fan or just a petrolhead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BashB23
50,I love this museum! With all the wonderful cars made by Toyota,This is a great place to visit. Ages of cars (before GPS and electronics!). Great place to throw a party too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/228nb
50,Mesmerizing insight into Toyota History,"Car after car, you realize where we started and how we evolved. Arranged in a very insightful manner. Take a trip around to see the monkey to man of Toyota.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Naum1
50,Time travel back in Toyota cars,"When I first visited this museum due to an organized finance meeting, I was blown away. Some of the cars I recognized from my childhood time, but some, it was probably my parents or grandparents' era!The fact that you can come so close to seeing each car was amazing. And since most of the time it is not overly packed --- most people don't know about this museum, you can enjoy leisurely without getting pushed over or hurried like other public museums.Also, there are history about Toyota. Do you know that the founder's last name was actually ToyoDa and not ToyoTa. But because ToyoDA has 10 strokes and he preferred 8 strokes for auspicious reason, the 2 strokes in Da was removed and became Ta. Hence today's Toyota!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngyChin
50,Amazing must see adventure,If you are into cars this is your kind of place. They have every Toyota ever made starting way back when. Also have the racing cars. You can get up and close to enjoy the beauty of these machines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchman59

50,Torrance Hidden Gem,We've had our volunteer luncheons at the Toyota USA Automotive Museum's event space and they open the doors to the museum for our guests to browse through. They have a great display of vintage Toyota automobiles. I'd recommend looking into when it's open to see them.

40,Score a 5 if you had a Toyota,"The Toyota USA Museum has one of about every Toyota vehicle ever produced. If you had one, and loved it, its brother is here. (I owned a hybrid when Toyota and GM made GEO PRISMs.)I attended a private party at the museum, one of several ways to see it. There is a phone number to call if you plan to visit. It's free.I expect it's only open weekdays by appointment or for events and functions.The entire history of Toyota is there as well. Also all their awards. Lots to read if you want the whole history.Probably over 100 cars and trucks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763rays

I love cars and trucks, and managed several automotive shops in the southbay. I always like to see cars kept up in pristine condition, and they definitetly were.

50,Great Toyota Museum,Once I went to the Toyota Museum in Torrance and they actually have old and new Toyotas in the museum. I was really surprised that it was coordinated so well. I really loved comparing the Toyotas of the past with those of the present time. It is a great attraction for the whole family and I would highly recommend seeing this wonderful car museum if you are in the South Bay Area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Metrotorrance
50,A relatively unknown gem!,"I found this museum by combing through all the things to do in the LA area. The first new car I ever owned was a 1980 Toyota and have owned several since. The museum tour is free! I contacted Susan via e-mail about reserving a tour and she got back to me right away. Great lady who has done a wonderful job acquiring Toyota vehicles for the museum. There are many older cars and trucks, race cars and some Lexus and Scion cars too. Most of the vehicles are survivor cars that are in great shape with no restoration done to them. You watch a video explaining the history of Toyota before your self-guided tour. At the end of the tour you are given a nice bag of small gifts. Allow a couple of hours or more for this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coastermeister
40,Hidden Toyota car museum,"This place is sort of off the gird. You need to now where it is, since there are no signs outside. They have a public meeting area and you can book it for free for any event you choose. The museum is very nice with pretty much on each of all the cars made in America. I was the only person touring the place and the head restorer gave me a personal tour. They just brought very in a Lexus LFA when I was there and I was allowed to sit in it. Very cool!! For those in Southern Calif, go see it now because they are not sure if it's moving to Texas when Toyota moves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onsenJohn
40,Never expected such a collection of cars,"Went here for a Scottish dinner one night in the large banquet area, and took time to stroll through the museum. Although small by most museum standards, well worth it. Toyota has done a fabulous job of displaying a wide variety of historical cars. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoAnnS582
40,Nice Treat,"We were invited by Management and got a private tour of the Museum. Honestly, we had no idea it even existed. It really is hidden gem and one really needs more time than our allotted schedule allowed. The race car selection is fabulous and the older model cars were so interesting, shows you how quickly time, tastes and design changes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WEISSBIER
40,Very nice collection,Made an appointment to go visit and after watching 2 short videos I went in to the museum which has a rich collection of all kinds of Toyota vehicles. From early day to present mixed in with racing cars. Staff was very friendly!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/a2553151

50,"If you love cars, you'll love this place!","It was a very nostalgic trip back in time, and as a car buff, it inspired me and their cars were pristine. Many great memories were restored by visiting there. We also had a real estate seminar there and I took every chance I got to take a break and visit the cars. The area for the seminar was wide and spacious and there was nothing I did not like.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MasseurJ
40,Unique Auto Museum,"Toyota USA operates this museum as a corporate resource located in a large warehouse-like building on the expansive Toyota complex in Torrance CA. It is not open to the public but can be arranged by appointment, as well the museum has a few open house days each year like Toyotafest in May. It's a unique collection of Toyota cars exported to the US beginning in the 1950's and those built here. The most interesting are the fully restored earlier Toyota's that mark the growth of Toyota in the North American market such as the original Corolla, the first generation Celica, and Corona.The arrangement of cars is not really intuitive but no question it's a unique experience to see such a large collection of well maintained popular cars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nexxen_11
50,Wow!,"I had the opportunity to work at the Toyota Museum for a one day interview & I was blown away. This is a must see for anyone & everyone. The history of Toyota is displayed with classic cars, dating back to the first ones off the line & to present day. With a great display of their rich racing history & fine automobiles. It is only worth checking it out yourself. Must make appointment by email or call.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZachR899
30,Not what I expected.,"Say aloud ""Toyota""...what comes to your mind?I will probably say ""Corolla"" or ""Celica"" or maybe ""Tundra"", not a luxury car like Rolls Royce or a high performance car like Ferrari.Keep this in mind when visiting the museum.I made my appointment via email, the answer was very fast.It is easy to reach and there is ample parking.I didn't find a receptionist on duty when I arrived, instead there was a meeting going on.I walked through the meeting and a security officer told me I was welcome to walk in the exhibition hall and take pictures.The general arrangement is like: ""Throw the cars somewhere"".Some cars don't have any information sheet, then you wonder why they are there.Some of the reace cars are unreachable, since they are stored at a high level.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rutilante
50,A great find in Torrance,"Toyota USA offers an intriguing look into the history of Toyota. From military vehicles, family sedans to race cars. The museum offers fine examples of most everything they have made. Best of all, it's all free. Run by a very friendly and informative lady. Just call and let them know the date and time you would like to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyS969
50,A Must See for Toyota Fans,"I've owned several Toyotas, so this was a treat for me. There is a broad range of representative vintage US Toyota models. There is also a very extensive collection of Toyota racing vehicles. I will be back again. I wasn't able to take it all in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MandH621
50,Best kept secret in Torrance and LA,"If you are a car enthusiast or a history buff, the Toyota Museum is a great place filled with cars from the beginning of Toyota's creation to today. There are also special car models that were used in movies as well as races. It's a really cool place to visit. Please call ahead to make an appointment since they can get booked up with group tours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travellingnome
50,Wow,"I have not been here, but it looks like a very interesting museum. The main reason for my review is to point out that Toyota is spelled ""Toytoa"" on this site.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MichaelFanaka
50,Hidden secret,"Have visited this site, check too make sure it is open. Recently expanded, gives a nice look at Toyota cars and history.Really well done, superbly clean and displays are very informative. Does not take a lot of time to see, but well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marw771
30,Interesting Toyotas and vintage cars,"Visited very briefly prior to attending a banquet function that was held in an adjoining room to the museum, so I didn't need a reservation or a tour guide. Just walked around to see the interesting newer & concept cars, vintage cars, model series placards, etc. They even have a couple of kid's peddle/push cars to keep small kids occupied while you look around. There are over 100 cars to see and it's not an enormous hanger-fairly convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelmom_fun
50,So many Cars and the best host.,Had a private tour of the museum and could not believe how many vintage and special vehicles in there. Don't miss the James Bond car and all the really old Toyota's.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zeke0323
50,A hidden gem in Torrance CA....Toyota history!,"My visit to the Toyota Museum was an unplanned last minute decision. I had about 12 hours of free time in Torrance, CA before my flight at LAX. I actually looked up interesting places in Torrance to visit and the museum came up as one such place. I showed up at the museum door without an appointment. However, Susan, the museum director was so kind enough to not only to allow me access, but also gave me a personal tour the facility. There were several cars from as far back as Toyota's very first car, 1936 the Classic Model AA 4-door sedan, to the introduction of the Lexus brand in the USA. I also saw their latest Scion FRS sports car. I even got a first look at their newest 2013 Lexus LS 460 L which had not appeared at dealer showrooms yet. All in all it was a wonderful experience and I wish I had more time to take it all.If you are in Torrance, I highly recommend touring the museum. The best part is its $free!A big thank you to Susan Sanborn and also Jose who both showed me around.Thanks. Joseph",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JosephK998

50,Amazing Collection,This is a hidden gem of a museum. Although it is open to the public its difficult to locate...Off of Van Ness near Toyota Way. There is not much signage but its located in the Pro Logis Building area. There are amazing vehicles in the collection all the way back to the first ones ever made off the line. Its free to tour and you don't need a reservation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonys488
20,You have to really love Toyota to squeeze in here,"There is potential here, but the collection hasn't been provided enough space, and there is very little interactivity or technology at play here. It is really just a large warehouse with every available vintage vehicle crammed inside. Kind of hard to maneuver through.But the staff is very gracious and accomodating -- they deserve more space to work with.Appointment required!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rwckennedy
50,Good history,We learned about the humble beginnings of Toyota and saw some cool cars.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lbdmt
