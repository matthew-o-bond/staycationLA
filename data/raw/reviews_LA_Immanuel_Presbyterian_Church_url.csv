40,Beautiful Church and a Good Venue for Concerts,"Immanuel Presbyterian Church is located in Koreatown, in Mid City, Los Angeles. It is a beautiful old Church with lovely architecture and stained glass. They have regular services and some in Korean, but I will not address those since our visit was for a concert.I wobble between 3 and 4 stars with this venue for several reasons. I will start with the 4 star part. Parking is 5$ across the street in a 3 story lot and for LA that is a good price. There are a few places to park on the street, but mind the signs. The security staff is Staff Pro and they are the best. You will feel safe, they will keep you safe. They also know set times and everything about the venue, sometimes more than the staff. The staff is super friendly and kind. There is seating, which is not often the case for smaller venues. The seating is in the pews and the balcony, which is lovely. The sound system is quite good and if you sit up close your view is amazing.As for the 3 star part of the venue, note that they have 2 very small bathrooms. If you don't use them during the set, you will be in a long, a very very long line. So, be prepared to deal with that. Further, the pews are lovely hard wood, but not at all comfortable. Also, because the entire floor is flat with no slant at all if you are beyond row 10 you will not be able to see much unless the person in front of you is small. I suggest if you can't get up close, run for the balcony. All the seats there are pretty good. The lobby is small and trying to get a drink or merch is very hard. No liquid is allowed in the venue at all, not even water.All in all though I would go back in a second. Their use of such professional security is important to me as I always have my young grandson with me. I do love their sound system and it is just a super cool place to see a concert. Sadly, we saw Mazzy Star and they were just awful, they played in the dark and this was their decision, and the venue had nothing to do with their pretentious choice. So, we saw a band that was awful, but I bet the next one will be great. Have a blast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elizabethlascheid
