50,Fabulous Venue,"I've now been to many events here at the Broad Stage (all for the Nat Geo Live events) and LOVE the space. The seats are spacious, the stage is large, and the staff working here are great. I only wish more than four Nat Geo Live speakers came here each season!!! :)",Elissa
50,Outstanding Venue for Music and Dance Presentations,I refer to this venue as the Broad Stage and it really is the finest discreet venue for the presentation of music and dance in the Los Angeles area. We come here often and especially enjoy the classical vocal music offerings here. The house is small in size making it an extremely attractive and intimate venue where no seat is really to far from the stage and the performer. Sightlines and acoustics are quite fine. We are SO glad to have this be a prominent part of the Los Angeles cultural scene.,Ken T
50,Great small 499 seat theater with top notch line up,I love this theater and feel lucky to have it in my city. I have seen several productions here...all of which have been top notch performances. They take chances and some of the stuff is unique while they also plug in things like Shakespeare and Jazz concerts. There is a family program here as well. The size and layout basically guarantees that there isn't a bad seat in the house. Free ample parking in their lot and easy access via public bus.,AFoolForTravel

50,Very Accommadating,We saw a One Woman show in a small theater but the the actress was phenominal. Lust and Marriage was a great show and hopefully will be seen around the USA.The management was great and personal. We will check out other shows soon.,TravelerVII
50,1st class presentations,the Broad Stage is a beautiful venue without a bad seat in the house and still manages to provide an intimate setting. Productions are 1st class. Wish I lived closer as I would be a season ticket holder.,MsLBL
50,great intimate theater,maybe one of the most interesting stages in LA for variety of cultural. I prefer this one if you into theater plays.,Micki M
50,Neighborhood Jewel,"I have been to the Broad three times now and have enjoyed the experience each time. For those of us living on the Westside where it can take 45 mins to an hour to get to Westwood, having our own theater wonderful. The parking is a pleasure, and its even fun to eat at one of the many near by restraunts and walk over.I highly reccomend one of the lower boxes, you are elevated and have a great view of the stage.",Hilary S
