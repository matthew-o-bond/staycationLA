50,You just gotta try this,"My brother Michael and I just went for our first glider plane experience. I have been going to do this for years, I wish I did it years earlier. If you are thinking of trying this experience don't hesitate do it NOW! As I said when we finished it is so much fun it should be illegal.",Peter D

50,You have to try!,I am glider pilot EU license. I was on business trip to LA. I decided to look for any gliding club around to visit. I found them using google. I did not book a flight however they were managed to find glider and instructor to fly with me. Worth to visit to learn something about mountain and desert flying. They are very friendly and doing very professional aviation.,Rafal
50,Amazing Experience,"I was in town visiting my dad who is passionate about sail planes, so I wanted to see what it was all about. Julie was friendly and welcoming and gave a quick overview of what to expect from the experience. Dale the instructor was awesome to fly with and made sure I was comfortable and was having a good time. He gave a great tour from the sky, and we were able to see the Pacific Ocean, Edwards AFB, and the San Andreas Fault. Everyone was really nice and professional. It was a great experience!!",Amy Stafford
50,My first glider lesson,I took the introductory lesson. I have always been interested in flying and decided to go to southern California soaring academy. It was so great! My instructor Jim was INCREDIBLE! He explained everything and made me feel super secure. I will definitely be going back for more lessons.,keef339
50,My 7-year old loved it!,"Professional, nice people. They were great with my son. We had a good time. We’ll be back to fly again.",John W
50,Awesome Experience,"I came to SCSA with no previous flight experience and I did not expect to progress nearly as much as I did in the 8 months I flew there. SCSA was always flexible and supportive with regards to my goals and availability. The staff is personable and professional, and are genuinely passionate about soaring and growing the gliding community. I was able to pass the written test as well as fly solo before leaving the SoCal area. I would not have been able to accomplish nearly as much as I did without the help of the staff and guidance from the instructors. I highly recommend flying here whether you are an accomplished pilot interested in gliding, or just taking a ride over the mountains. Take an intro ride over the mountains and you'll be hooked.",John P
50,Doing It Right!,"I took soaring lessons at the SCSA for a year and could not help but be profoundly impressed by the constant professionalism and expertise of the staff. From the front office to the tow pilots, everyone seemed dedicated to doing his/her job right for every flight. I'm moving out of the area but plan to continue taking lessons wherever I happen to be. I just hope other gliding facilities are as well-managed and expertly staffed as the Southern California Soaring Academy.",_jdstalk
50,Flying as it's meant to be.,"I regularly fly to Los Angeles. So I decided to make my way to SCSA yesterday, Sunday, June 25.I sent Chris Bennett an email a week before my trip and hewas very accommodating. In fact everyone I met at the academy were very personable and friendly.The guys set me up with Dale Masters, who I found to be a very knowledgeable and professional glider CFI(instructor pilot).I have to say that I learnt more in those 90 minutes of flying than I've done in my last 10 flights.Thanks Dale.I will come back on my next LAX layover for sure.Thanks to everyone at SCSA for arranging and great time and lasting memory.Fly safe!Erik M.B777 First OfficerCathay Pacific Airways.",erik m
50,Awesome soaring spot!,"I'm a glider student from Russia, visited the Academy during one of my business trips to CA. In RU I'm taking a beginner course on Blanik L13 without any soaring for now (according to our rules, soaring starts later). In CA I wanted to have some new experience - the glider ASK-21, a flight over desert and mountains, a few soaring techniques in waves (in RU we only have thermals). And I got much more than I expected to! ASK-21 was very nice to control (even though it was very different with the Blanik and was a little hard in the beginning). My instructor Dale (not sure I spell it correctly) provided awesome and unforgettable experience, showed me the basics of soaring in waves, and I was able to explore by myself and find something! In the end I felt I could fly infinitely in those waves without sinking - the mountains underneath, the blue sky above, the easy manageable plane around me, and the wonderful pleasure inside of me! :) I really loved it!I would definitely recommend the spot to anybody - very nice and friendly crew, easy to drive from LA, and again - unforgettable emotions! Thanks Soaring Academy!",Balu-183
50,Fantastic!,"I had a terrific time at Crystalaire Airport. Actually, I was in Valyermo at a training camp, running and cycling in the mountains, but being a glider pilot from Sweden I couldn't help noticing the gliders being aerotowed just above the house where we were staying for the camp. So after emailing the airfield and asking for a ride I went there with a friend, who has never been in a glider before. We received a hearty welcome from Julie and the other crew on the ground when we arrived. Jim was our flying instructor and he took very good care of us and adjusted the rides to our very different levels of experience. Jim allowed me to do as much of the flying as I wanted, so we agreed that he would do the take-off and landing and I did the aerotow and the rest of the flying (apart from some picture-taking...). We did not have much lift on this particular day but we had a great time anyway and Jim showed me the Edwards Air Force Base among other interesting sites. The view towards the mountains is fantastic and I understand they often have a nice wave over there. I would love to come back here for some more flying!",KarinaNi
50,DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE!!!,"From the moment you walk in and meet Alexis to departing good-byes from Julie, Chris,and the ground crew Max and Miguel and everything in between you will say, ""once in a life time experience"" ""beyond expectation"", ""could not have been any more pleased""!!The management and staffs' attention to my safety and comfort was evident throughout my 4 hour visit. There is an ongoing dialogue about weather and wind conditions...everyone is always on the same page.My pilot, Frank always always made sure I understood what was going to happen and what was happening from pre-flight check to disembarking the soar plane. His enthusiasm and love for gliding and sharing that with his novice passenger was much appreciated. He was so patient when pointing land marks out in the distance and waiting for me to see what was so obvious to him!!!! Breath taking views:)Thank you again Soaring Academy for the unforgettable afternoon in your airspace!!I would be remiss if I didn't give a ""shout out"" to your commitment to the community, working with the youth through the STEM program in Santa Clarita and Wounded Worriers...providing adaptive alternatives for Vets so they can also experience the world of soaring....Thank you for serving these two great causes:)",terrischolz

50,Awesome!,"I came to California/Mojave Desert for a business trip and as glider pilot I had already in mind to use this opportunity also for soaring in the US. By research within internet I stumbled finally across the Southern California Soaring Academy. I went by to Crystal Airport and they brought me on schedule with an instructor for the weekend following.BTW, the staff was quite friendly, warm hearted and always helpful which I felt well from the beginning....Thumbs up!My instructor Dale was fabulous. Apart from his great flying experience and instructor skills he was also an overwellming ""tour guide""Wow! I had really an outstanding time soaring within the mountains high, getting into the ""bow"" wave.... During this unbeliveable flight I could see the Pacific Ocean, the Channel Islands , Los Angeles, Edwards AFB, the San Andreas Fault and even more....making this flights to one of the best experiences in my life.

50,Out of control experience!!!,"Southern California Soaring Academy is dedicated to empowering disabled Veterans on their road to recovery through the therapeutic qualities of flying. Flying is an activity which has proven to help with the rehabilitation process. It instills a sense of confidence and helps many with controlling their stress. The act of gliding creates a weightless environment for those struggling with physical impairments and offers them a freedom they can’t find on land. The group environment that Southern California Soaring Academy provides also instills the sense of belonging to a unit - a cohesive structure that they had while serving in the military and it is this bond that allows them to share their stories with each other and continue down a road that promotes healing and growth. I am forever grateful, love you guys!~Sean Hopson",snipersort
50,Awesome experience!,"This was an awesome experience. Got an intro lesson for my wife's birthday and for myself as well since i was there. We are both power pilots so being up in the air is nothing new to us... but soaring in glider is amazing!! It doesn't compare to flying an airplane! Needless to say I am hooked. Our instructor Dale was great, fun, knowledgable, awesome instructor and we felt totally safe the whole time. All of the staff were very friendly, more like a family atmosphere.",Matt C
50,Magnificent flight,"I was in Victorville on business and got a last minute day off to explore. Being a private pilot, I looked around for activities that would satisfy my flying bug when I stumbled across Southern California Soaring Academy. They were able to squeeze me in for a discovery flight last-minute due to a cancellation, and I had a fantastic time. Staff were very friendly and professional, and my instructor pilot was very knowledgable and helped me learn how to find thermals and truly soar like a bird. A great experience!",Ryan K
50,Thoroughly enjoyable ecoerience,I visited the academy twice during a business trip to LA. Both flights were both exhilarating and instructional. The operation was professional and confident. I now have the gliding bug properly. I would strongly recommend a visit.,Andrew Q

50,L A's secret amusement park.,"I'm surprised people don't flock to this place. For me, it was well worth losing the 12 lbs in 21 days to meet the requirement for a Glider ride. This adventure was for my Daughter's Birthday.We ventured into the Mojave Desert Sky in one of the sleek Gliders, towed first by an energetic plane and her enthusiastic pilot. Once aloft, our soaring craft gently caressed the Snowy San Gabriel Mountains with her superb peaks. Thereafter we sailed Northerly over the Mojave Desert with its stunning expanse of sprawling openness.Our skilled pilot managed to find some mysterious waves of air that caused our sleek craft to dance and bob as the wind rushed by filling our ears, reminding us that we were dependent on it's power to stay aloft.It was thereafter, that our alert guide suggested some aerobatics to which we obliged. Our plane quickly reminded us that it possessed a wild side. Showing us it wasn't to be mistaken for some shy, sky cruiser, the glider transformed into a High Strung Stunt Performer. With the move of some gadgets we were tossed into some reverse or side rolls plunging us toward the Mojave floor, only to be catapulted as if from a mighty sling shot skyward again. The thrill of being slammed into our seats exceeded any amusement park ride. It seemed the sky was swallowing us!The Ship again gained composure and gently conveyed us back for a fine landing.I'll tell you why you want to try one of these rides out:The staff Especially Chris and Julie are very friendly. While you await your departure in a shaded area, the views of the Northern San Gabriels seem invite you to take a closer look while an occasional desert breeze brushes the face. Both pilots and Soaring students talk openly about their fascinating disciplines of flying. The crew take great care in safety and in the explanation of your adventure. Careful inspections are made of your Craft. Again I was glad to be told I needed to lose weight to fly: It was worth it.!! Thanks a lot Chris!!!!!I'm not sure how much longer this experience can remain so seemingly secret!",674tommy
50,Best ride ever,"We went for my sisters birthday and it was Ahhhhhhmazing!!!! We had the most wonderful time, our flight instructor, Dale, was very knowledgeable, professional, and so fun! The whole staff made us feel extremely welcome and comfortable and we felt like a part of their family. It's worth the drive, the views are incredible and we can't wait to come back for solo rides!",Erika N
50,"Great Experience, Highly Recommend It!!!","I gave this experience to my husband for his birthday and he had a great time. We found the staff to be more than accommodating, they made me very comfortable while my husband was up in the glider and they made a point to chat with me while I waited. The instructor took his time going through the glider with my husband, and he got to fly it a little bit in the air. It was definitely worth the experience and we recommend it to anyone wanting to try it!!!",sbctravelers
50,Best ride & time of life,"I saw a glider flying over when hiking at Baden Powell peak and always wanted to fly gliders. It looked great and I had to do it. So I called & made reservations. People there are very helpful, friendly. I'm glad to know this is a non profit organization that supports wounded warriors & veterans for who can use mush support, I feel.My friend & I went for 40 minutes flight with Adrian? who volunteers for this academy. He is also a member of Air Force. I somehow learned & knew that gliders are one of safest planes although no guarantee. The first thing Adrian said to us was he has a family and he'd like to come home safely & have dinner with them. It was an assurance of him that the safety is the priority. He was not only a very experienced but professional pilot. He made sure if we're feeling well, not sick during the flight. When we told him we're fine and could handle more, he took us for ride of life, awesome, amazing maneuverings. We had so much fun, and time went so fast. When we finally landed (it was perfect & smooth), people on ground told that we're screaming lots? They heard us on the radio. This was the best ride & experience we've ever had by far. We now know how birds fly and catch the thermal air. Thanks Adrian and all friendly staff & volunteers. We'll be bcak.",mark i
50,Fly Like An Eagle,"If you want an exciting activity, just hop in one of these planes with an awesome pilot! We live in Southern California and hike the trails we flew over making this experience even more exciting, in fact we were hiking one day when one of these planes swished over the mountain we were hiking.....wanted to glide ever since! I would recommend this for anyone who loves to fly....its the ultimate flying experience. We chose a two seater since it was our first experience. take pictures and happy gliding!",Vicki L

50,Exciting Trip & Pleasant Staff,"Great views from the glider, the staff were friendly, and the instructor was knowledgable and informative during the flight! They even let me steer the glider for a bit. Too bad the wind was a little rough that day; if you're at all prone to motion sickness, look for a calm day to glide. (If you get too nauseated, they'll just fly you back right away if you want, no big deal.)",ryamre
50,Amazing experience,Everyone was very nice and knowledgeable. The staff was welcoming and the pilot explained every aspect of flying and did tricks with the plane.One of the best experiences of my life!,Kim J
50,Amazing soaring!,"I've been a glider pilot for more than 30 years, although not active in the last 5. Planning a business trip to California, I thought I could treat myself and go fly a glider. Although their schedule was booked solid, Julie went out of her way and made it happen!I've been to several gliding schools and clubs in the USA, Brazil, France, Switzerland... and never found a caring staff like at Southern California Soaring Academy. Everyone was so nice and welcoming that makes you to come back soon!Their gliders are well maintained and clean! Soaring conditions are excellent. We took the DG-500 up and climbed to 14,000'. Amazing! Thank you George!I took a friend that never flew in small aircrafts or gliders and she could no t resist. Julie worked the schedule to my friend could also fly.If you are looking to fly gliders in the Los Angeles area, this is the place!",lfcs66
50,A dream come true.,"Despite being a lifelong aviation enthusiast, I had never been in a small aircraft and never imagined it was possible to become a pilot. After being given a gift certificate for a introductory glider lesson, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to fulfill a lifelong dream. My instructor, Dale Masters and company staff (Chris and Julie Bennet) were enthusiastic and welcoming. My family joined me for a day of fun at the airport watching other glider pilots perfect their craft, walk around looking at the aircraft, and watching their dad fly a plane! The people here love what they do and take aviation seriously. I still can't stop talking about it. If you're thinking of an affordable way to become an aviator, consider soaring. And if you just want a thrilling and inspiring ride you'll never forget, by all means make the trip and let one of these fine aviators give you a ride. Thanks to everyone.",Tony G
50,Super Day with wonderful people!,I havent flown for 25 years and decided to take my son to start gliding lessons over the weekend. The instructors were so nice and well prepared that I decided to go myself for a ride in the local wave! With Dale's instructions I went easily to 11.000 ft and enjoyed every minute!My son did 10 flights in a 3 day crash course and is almost solo:)Great place and lots of fun!Thanks for all guys!,RaimundoSoares
50,Perfect gift for couples!,"Ladies, if your significant other is the adventurous type then this is one of the most exciting flight experiences you can offer them. The staff at the Southern California Soaring Academy has been nothing short of amazing helping me include a flight lesson as part of my anniversary surprise for my boyfriend. They understood that it was a special occassion and was very accomodating to fit us in to their schedule (big s/o to Ron and Julie!) even though the season for Soaring was winding down.I had experienced Soaring before so I was familiar with the feeling of being in a small aircraft, but watching my boyfriend react to the experience from beginning to end was a gift in and of itself. His pilot took really good care of him (another big s/o to Adrian!) and gave just enough of a thrill while he was up in the air to leave him wanting more. As soon as he landed, all he wanted to do was get back up in the air again. Days later, he was glued to their website to plan another trip up and get another flight lesson in the works.We had such a memorable anniversary and I couldn't have done it without the help of SCSA. Trust me, it's worth the drive to see your loved ones happy!Recommended tips:- Book separate gliders! It's more fun when you are able to take control of the aircraft while you're up in the air. Otherwise, there is a two-passenger glider that is more for sight-seeing.- If you're feeling REALLY adventurous or if you know that your significant other is an adrenaline junkie, ask for a pilot who is certified for acrobatic flights.",vncxrsr
50,Boy Scout Soaring Adventure,"Southern California Soaring Academy,Thanks again for the wonderful weekend you provided for the Boy Scouts. Troop 355 had a fabulous time going soaring and completing the Aviation Merit Badge! Thank you for the use of your campground and the clubhouse for teaching the class. Without those facilities we would not have been able to get the boys through the merit badge.What really made the trip a success was you and your friendly staff, the confidence we have in your safety practices as well as having a well organized program. It really was an amazing feat to get over 50 half hour rides all completed in one day!Warmest Regards,Dr. Steve SmithAviation Merit Badge CounselorTroop 355San Marino Ca.",Steven S
50,Best thermal I have ever experienced,"Had a fantastic time but after being used to scratching around in the European Dutch coastal air, jumping off tow at 2k and taking a large single 10knt thermal to 14k was not what I am used to. I flew in from Camarillo by Cessna and there was no issue with using the strip. Sure, it's a commercial operation but everybody was friendly, things were run efficiently and I will certainly return when next in CA.",Anthony W
50,Great place to start your next hobby,"The staff were all very nice and easy to deal with. It's a great place to learn how to soar, though I was only in the state for the summer, so I was there just twice. I do wish I had stuck with the same instructor both times, which I don't remember having the option. In my case it wasn't an issue at all, since I was only trying to stay ""in the cockpit"" until I got home. Only real downside I saw is the insane desert thermals you're in danger of getting used used to if you fly somewhere else!",Brandon S
50,This is it!,"This is it! Hard to imagine a better place for riding in, learning to fly, or flying gliders. Southern California Soaring Academy (SCSA) is located a reasonable drive from LA, in the high desert just a few miles from the San Gabriel mountain range. SCSA offers all kinds of glider flying--desert thermals, ridge and mountain soaring. Safety is the top priority, with first-class staff and gliders, and radio communication and control.The staff and crew are friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Guests represent a broad cross-section of people, but all share a passion for soaring. Equipment is clean and well-maintained, as are the facilities. It's a family place, including picnic, barbecue, and overnight RV parking areas.During my two week visit last month, my 84 year-old friend joined me one day for her first ever glider ride. She came back excited and beaming. She continues to talk about it as one of the most fun experiences of her life, including the moderate acrobatics that she happily accepted trying when they were offered.For learners, instruction is expert, enthusiastic, and highly personalized to the student (perhaps a little more documentation of lesson activities might be helpful, though). You can schedule your lessons through the online booking system, and you can request a particular instructor who you feel suits you best. Charges are very reasonable, and clearly accounted in the billing system.The excellence of SCSA extends even to their very complete, clear, and up-to-date Website. For more details, photos and videos, and current information, visit them any time. I’m certainly very glad I did!",Frank B
50,One of the bucket list ticked off,did this with 2 work colleagues of mine that had a day free in SoCal. Couldn't meet nicer people and the flight was absolutely amazing. The pilot - Dale was a total pro and delighted in giving people max enjoyment. Each of the three flights were completely different as conditions were changing. The following link is a short video that one of my colleagues took on his flight. http://youtu.be/xSass-rTBTU,joeCantwell
50,Happy Birthday to Me!,"I was given an introductory glider ride as a birthday present. Though the drive to the facility from Santa Monica is long and tedious, it was well worth the trip. Everyone associated with the organization is very nice and knowledgeable and my instructor Dale is an expert glider pilot. My original nervousness soon gave way to exhilaration and my 45-60 minute ride passed far too quickly. Certainly a memorable way to spend the day and welcome my new year!",David L

So much fun!It was a great day for all.Highly recommend it for anyone of any age.,Jciron
50,Amazing place...,"I'm a glider pilot from Washington state, but occasionally I travel to southern California. I always make sure I have time for a visit to Crystalaire, and book a long flight in one of their excellent DG 1000s dual seat gliders. Since I'm a rated glider pilot, they let me fly the glider the whole time, but I fly with one of their flight instructors. The staff is excellent, friendly and pretty laid back, Heck, this is Califorinia :) I usually get there in the winter time, and take time to brush my skills in the preparation for the spring flying. Once, I got there at the end of September and had a blast... Nice puffy clouds, I got up to about 12500 feet, very nice view. The gliders are top notch, DG 1000s are awesome. Even if the location and the weather conditions would be bad, flying the DG 1000s alone, would make up for it. Even the prices are fair. I recommend this place for both (glider) pilots or anyone else interested in to experience soaring. This is as good as it gets.",Laviniu T

This makes a great experience for anyone looking for something different. Come out and give it a try!",ChefHaze
50,Awesome experience!,"Decided on a whim to do something fun and exciting. I got the thrill of a lifetime. Nothing beats the feel of soaring quietly through the air like a bird over the San Gabrielle mountains. What a view, what an adventure and I couldn't imagine a better group of people to do it with than the pilots and crew of this place. They make you feel welcome and involved in the flight not like an outsider to be dealt with. I can't wait to do it again!!!",Amileinmyshoes
50,Soaring to new heights!,"This is a must do if flying is on your bucket list! I have flown in all types of motor planes from two seaters to 747's but soaring really gives you the ""feel"" of flying like the birds. The staff at So CA Soaring Academy were delightful and very well organized. My flight time was 3pm and they were ready with my pilot and flight crew on my arrival. The crew was helpful and patient as all was set up and my pilot Adrian was the best! He explained all the steps as he did the preflight checks and got me situated in the glider. He gave me the front seat as it ""had the best view."" This meant that I also had certain controls he did not have in the back seat....such as the yellow one that disengaged the tether! How cool I got to take care of that little job.The tow plane was timely and before long we were up, up and away. Again, Adrian was an experienced pilot who new when to talk and when to just let the experience sink in. I was impressed with his Air Force credentials and that he was also a flying instructor. Having some flying experience years ago, he sensed I would be open to riding the unusual updraft wave that had us climbing to 9000ft in less than a minute! Then (with my permission) he put the glider through its paces and even let me try my hand at the stick. Wow, what a GREAT Christmas present from my hubby!! Shows how well he knows me...that this is an experience I would not only enjoy but look forward to doing again.I can highly recommend this Soaring Academy for their professionalism, staff training, condition of equipment and personal touch...all VERY important when doing flying of any kind.Cost, according to hubby was very reasonable and location an easy 40-50 minute drive from the Santa Clarita Valley.Try Soaring.....you'll LOVE it!!",TKanowsky
50,On a whim,Showed up without any reservations on a whim; I expected to just see what soaring is about. I figured long lines...lots of forms to fill out..an intimidating atmosphere...Was I was wrong..went from wondering about it to finding myself in cockpit in 10 min with my hand at the controls. Extremely impressive operation. These people are going to go far..no pun intended.,Robert W
50,First Lesson Fantastic!,"This introduction to soaring in a high-performance, German ASK 21 was my Christmas gift from my wife and son. The staff and instructors at the Academy are excellent; the attitude and atmosphere friendly and casual; the facilities and location are top-notch. While winter conditions are sometimes iffy in terms of thermals, we found an area of mountain wave lift which allowed us to achieve 8000 feet AGL with a spectacular view of the San Gabriel mountains. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect flying experience and I highly recommend to anyone interested in either a glider ride or instruction!",Barry R
50,Great flying experience!!,"I luckily found SCSA with an online search looking to find a place to experience soaring with ridge thermals. I live in Florida and there isn’t that type of flying at my home Gliderport. Although the staff mentioned that I was there on a “mediocre day” for thermals, the flight and the ground experience was exceptional! The staff is easy going, friendly and very professional. SCSA will be on my schedule for all my upcoming trips to California!Thank you Julie, Dale and ChrisTim S.",Tim S
50,"Great, and real, entertainment for your children!","Having started soaring when I was 13 years old, I could not wait for my g/f's child to turn the age to appreciate flying at basic element.It has been a while since I been back to Pearblossom, but I got my sailplane solo license at South California Soaring Academy when I 14 years old.Not much has changed except the grounds have been upgraded with nice bathrooms and picnic area.I wanted to purchased a 45 min. Introduction Lesson for Aaron on a Sunday without any reservations. So I thought we would take our chances and just drive up there hoping there was availability. Driving less than an hour from Sherman Oaks, we got there to find out they had an opening two hours later. Perfect. It gave us some time to give Aaron a few driving lesson on the deserted back roads near the airport and to get some killer beef jerky at the local Indian Store.Aaron met his instructor, a pilot that recent returned from Afghanistan, and they were off into the wild blue yonder. For a winter day, there was some great wind waves over the mountain range which allowed them to gain over 4,000 feet after the tow plane set them free. This also allow them to do some fairly extreme spins, turns and stalls. I video taped the experience and I could hear Aaron asking for more extreme stuff over and over. He loved it!!While in the air and afterwards, the instructor kept comparing this experience to video games, emphasizing that real flying is much more fun but it comes with responsibility. Since Aaron has mentioned that he is interested in flying as a career, the discussion of joining the ROTC at his high school came up. There was even an intern out there that was in the ROTC that helped with some good advice.Overall, it was a great day. Well worth the money and really gave Aaron a WOW factor. Plus, it got him off the video games for the day so he could experience life at its best...",Jeff S

40,Great place to fly,"I was travelling in California so decided to book in some soaring. I usually fly in Europe and was in for some surprises here, the lift is strong and in the mountains it was rough and really exciting. I flew the DG1000 with George who was really laid back and just let me get on with it, offering many useful pointers. You may wonder why I only give 4 stars. The glider, conditions and George definitely deserve 5 but I had booked this flight some weeks in advance and when I arrived after a 2hr drive the person I was supposed to be flying with had gone home, they said one of the other instructors would fill in, hence George. I had booked the DG for 2 hrs but ended up with just 1hr in the air. To begin with I was just asked to wait around for over and hour while they sorted an instructor. It wouldn't stop me coming back here for more, the flying was awesome, but next time I will call ahead to check the arrangements are as planned.",Anthony W
50,Sensory overload.....first glider flight,"I finally decided to look into flying a glider and was not disappointed. Once I was seated in the front cockpit I started thinking what have I done this thing has no motor. Next, Thumbs up! The roar of the tow plane and off we went. We climbed for a while then released, we went right and tow plane went left. We were free... the thrill was just starting.. Once we hit our first thermal we went into a tight right turn and as I watched the ground disappear far below, it hit me who needs a motor. We climbed to 9500 ft and played in the thermals for a while. The thermal would spit us out .... and the chase was on again. We did this for awhile and then my instructor asked if I would like to ridge soar.. you bet! ..and off to the ridge we went. As we approached, I remember thinking that ground is coming up awfully fast and the tops of the trees seamed to dance in the wind. Then I saw them, hikers. I waved and guess what? They waved back.....at about the same time I saw them, my butt went heavy into the seat and we were climbing at an incredible rate.... When I looked back down at the them , they pretty small..... We soared along the ridge for a while gaining altitude. Then it was time to head back... My instructor would patiently remind me ""Right stick right rudder, Left stick left rudder"" that's what I was supposed to be doing... As we came into sight of the air port I was able to do a few maneuvers head north then bank left then bank back to north.... after a while.. I was asked if I want to see a few other maneuvers. Well of course I said yes!.... 2 wing over’s and 2 hammerheads later .. My brain was still trying to figure out if my body was still there or somewhere else in space and time. ... we turned into our approach pattern and prepared to land. The electric whir of the landing gear was all I heard then the green light on the instrument panel .. Landing gear was down.... and the spoilers came up and we started to slow... We touched down and headed right for the parking space we had left from... then we stopped and the whole plane just tipped a bit and it was all over...anti climactic after what I had just experienced.The staff, I thought were genuine and It showed they truly loved what they do. Will I go again? Did I enjoy this experience? The answer is YES, I am now hooked.One word of advice though do not ask to do a wing over or hammerhead if you have a history of a week stomach!! Other than that Go For It!!!!!!!Oh yeah if you have a GO PRO make sure you fully understand how to use it and make sure you don't have a full memory card!!!!!I",Jer541
50,"Super laid back, yet totally professional.","Don't let getting there deter you! It maybe just east of nowhere, but you can tell it's a second home to everyone who works there. My fiancé and I scheduled a 40 ride as a tandem. I'm a lean 6'3' and she's a thin 5'9"". It was a very tight squeeze for sure, but manageable. Our pilot was awesome! Totally diffused any stress we had instantly. Young guy, learned up in Monterey. Can't remember his name. I'm sure they'll know who he is if you ask though. Anyway, we were in the air 20 minutes after we got there, which was awesome. Great thrill ride, all smiles. Great people! Great time!",StephandDexter
50,Into the wild blue yonder,What an experience! I heard about gliding and I thought I would try it. I did the 45 minute flight. Amazing! I was scared at first but then it became very enjoyable. Definitely a bucket list item. Worth every penny.,Hcfman
50,Fantastic day at the SCSA!,"As an active member of a glidingclub in Europe (Netherlands) I sent out an email to the SCSA to ask for options to vistit the SCSA to go gliding for the day during my layover in Los Angeles.I had a very welcoming answer overnight and went to Crystal airport a couple of days later.The route on the website is ver well explained.I was warmly welcomed by Julie and Chris, the owners of the SCSA.They have very good, well maintained, new equipment. ASK21s, DG1000, Grobs, etc.Even some 3 seaters (which was new to me!).I had a great 1hr30 flight in the DG1000 with one of the (very friendly) instructors, Bill, to do my checkride. Great scenery, strong thermals and the possibility to ridge flying. They have done some impressive distances out of Chrystal Airport!!I can highly recommend going to Chrystal airport if you're interested in making a flight in a glider.Either for a passenger flight or to be checked out and fly yourself.I will definitely come back and go gliding again.Thanks for a great day out!",Coenn
50,Great experience,"Glider flying the American way! Make a booking, be there at the set time, do the usual paperwork and off you go. No need to stay behind after your flight, either. Not exactly suitable for welfare recipients though.Everybody is friendly, the whole organisation works, the equipment I saw is well-maintained. The DG1000 is awesome to fly!In case you want to fly self-responsible, i.e. single-seaters, be aware that besides your valid license you need to bring your own renter's insurance.",Martin S
50,Worth Every Flipping Penny!,"Great way to celebrate my 50th birthday and check another thing off the 'ol bucket list! Adrian was a fabulous pilot who caught the thermals and flew us to nearly 11,000 feet. We soared over Baden/Powell and Mt. Baldy and managed a few ""acrobatics"" just for fun. Julie was a great hostess and the entire support crew was friendly and helpful. As Adrian said, it was an ""epic day."" Southern California Soaring Academy is an epic company!",Wendie M
50,L.A. Area Soaring,"Excellent place for soaring. Very friendly staff with nice well maintained equipment to fly. I had not been soaring for a couple of years and was in the area on business with a free day so I spent the afternoon with them and got flying again. Highly recommend this location to anyone wanting to learn to fly sailplanes, get current or just go for a ride with experienced friendly instructors. My instructor for the day was Bill and I had a great time flying and learning about the local area and ASK-21 sailplane. Go check them out, you won't be sorry.",Steve S
50,"Great soaring, Friendly People","Well maintained sailplanes and tow planes, outstanding instruction in a great soaring location staffed by very friendly people.If you are an experienced glider pilot the location has some great soaring conditions, and the posibility of some great cross country work. They have both thermal and ridge soaring. It would also be a fine location to obtain a glider rating.They have a good mix of sailplanes including high preformance sailpanes for rent. I typically rent lower perfomance craft like Blaniks back home. The DG 1000 with 46 to1 glide ratio was a kick to fly.They also give rides for folks who are not rated and curious about unpowered flight.Highly recommended.",James M
50,World Class Soaring,"Greetings. I'm a private pilot, SEL + Glider, and have been flying out of SCSA for quite some time now. This is a world class operation with world class staff, world class equipment and world class soaring conditions. If you are pilot looking to enjoy some amazing soaring and vistas, this is the place. Desert, mountains, ridge soaring, ocean views from the local mountains; this place has it all! Incredible thermal activity most of the year and amazing wave conditions prevail throughout the winter. I highly recommend it!",Soar-Socal
50,Awesome Glider Rides and Instruction,I have been out to the establishment multiple times and have been very pleased with the them. The glider instruction offered there is very high level and the conditions for soaring are consistently spectacular. The folks that run the business are very easy to work with and have established a family friendly environment that will make anyone feel comfortable. The facilities are not as built up as most executive airports so come prepared if you are planning an extended stay.,Justin S
50,Awesome time!,What a great bunch of folks. They were able to squeeze me in on short notice for two flights. After flying I noticed that they support the wounded warrior foundation with the business. It's a great cause. I will definitely return to this great school for all my glider ratings.,Jamieg74
50,Fantastic Flight,"I went on my first flight today and had an amazing ride. The staff is really great and very laid back and welcoming. Julie was very kind and informative when I called to make reservations and upon my arrival. Martin was my pilot and in addition to being a great pilot, he was just a riot to fly with because he just went with the flow of my sense of humor (I'm still a little disappointed that I never did get that in-flight beverage that I requested! ;) ). I felt safe the entire time and wish I could have spent hours up there. If your considering gliding...don't hesitate...just do it! And definitely go for the longer flight. You won't regret it! I'll definitely be up there again.",lovescalifornia
50,Amazing experience!,"I recently spent 4 days taking glider lessons at the Southern California Soaring Academy and it really was an amazing experience. Each lesson ranged from about an hour to two hours including a pre flight briefing on the days weather conditions. I am 17 years old and this was my first time flying any sort of aircraft. I think flying a glider is a great introduction to piloting an aircraft due to its simple instrument panel and the enjoyable, unpredictable nature of each flight.The instructors and other employees at the Southern California Soaring Academy were all very knowledgeable about soaring in gliders and extremely friendly.Once in the air, the view is incredible with the sprawling high desert to the North and the San Gabriel mountains to the South. Be sure to take a camera up with you as the sights are unparalleled and also wear warm clothes, especially in the winter as it can get very cold in the gliders.All over, I had a great experience and would love to go back soon!",Maddaw123
50,Record Breaking Soaring in Los Angeles,"A warm hello by the friendly staff, accompanied by the beautiful San Gabriel makes SCSA the prime place for anyone interested in year-round soaring. Even if you aren't interesting in pursuing the sport, it is an absolute thrill of a lifetime experiencing flying like a bird.",Ian B
