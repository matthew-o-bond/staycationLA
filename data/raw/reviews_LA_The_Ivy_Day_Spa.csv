50,Day of beautification,"Ihad a very relaxing, no rush, calm, exhilarating, and nice pedicure with Paula. She was awesome. This was the first pedicure I have had at Ivy Day Spa and it was amazing!! I am hooked. I had an awesome massage, salt scrub and detox wrap. Nina was awesome, I felt so soft and refreshed. My skin felt like silk. I had a beautiful day. You need to treat yourself and this is the place!",Barbara M
30,Skip the enhancements on the massage,Clean and very nice facility. I went for a 50 minute massage and decided to spend the extra $35 for hot stones. The were used for about 2-3 minutes on my back and that was it. I was hesitant to add this on to total a $140 massage and I sincerely regretted it after the service was completed. My recommendation if possible would be to spend the extra $10 and head to Burke Williams in Sherman Oaks instead. At least their facilitates offer a more tranquil and quiet environment with better privacy.,CynJ22
10,The Ivy is the WORST! Stay away!!!,"I had been a loyal customer and even member when this was Glen Ivy Spa. I have tried to give The Ivy a chance but every time I am disppointed. The staff is very unprofessional and make me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I had an appointment to get a Brazilian wax. The esthetician, after having me undress and get on the treatment table, refused to wax me and then sent me downstairs where she said the owner was waiting to talk to me. I felt like a kid being sent to the principal's office. The owner was waiting fir me at the front desk and, in front of everyone there, (guests checking in and out included) he told me that the esthetician did not feel comfortable doing my wax and that there is nothing he can do if she decides she dies not want to. I was not even given a reason why, just told they have no other appointments with anyone else and shown the door!!",Ryan B
50,Beyond Nice!,We wanted to purchase discounted gift cards and missed the deadline due to a power outage. Lena still honored the the gift card discount and comped us the Grotto for our troubles!!,Debbie B
50,Perfect Birthday for 20-year old daughter,"We just celebrated my daughter’s 20th birthday at the spa (her idea). Myself, my sister and our mom and my girl. It exceeded expectations on all levels. When my daughter mentioned this as a birthday, my inclination was to take her to the Four Seasons in Westlake or the Peninsula in Beverly Hills for a special day...but we popped in to tour the Ivy and remembered how well-designed it is with all the sky-lights and the beautiful plants and common areas. I prefer a jacuzzi and not all spas have them...so that’s a plus. Our massages and facial were of the quality we have.l come to expect at 5-Star hotels. We didn’t want to leave. It was peaceful, clean, friendly, well stocked and beautiful!",MaryLtravels
10,Landfill,This place is an overrated dump! Don't waste your time & money. It is NOT affilliated with Geln Ivy Corona with the true hot springs.,PedroPirates
50,Best Spa in Santa Clarita!,"I recently visited the Ivy and it exceeded my expectations! It is a beautiful, peaceful and relaxing environment. The staff was very professional, friendly and attentive. I had a Fire and Ice Facial and it was amazing!! My skin never looked so radiant and glowing!! I look forward to treating myself to another wonderful experience at the Ivy day spa very soon.",LiveAloha2017
50,The best Spa day ever!!!,"I came to visit a friend in Valencia so we thought what better day to have than a Spa Day! We both really enjoyed the grotto. If I could do that every week I would! My skin felt so super soft. Next we spent the next hour chatting in the hot tub, then our massages. Everything was so nice and relaxing. Me and my girl will be doing this more often!",Lisa M
50,Top Notch Service! Best Spa Ever!,"Best spa ever in my opinion! I have been coming to this spa for over 5 years and I love it. I especially love that it is located in the heart of Valencia, my home town! I feel like the services are top notch and the price points are extremely reasonable for the great treatments you get here! The staff is wonderful, Very kind, caring and always go above and beyond for me. They also take great care of my family when they come the spa. The solarium is the biggest hidden GEM in Santa Clarita Valley. It is a great place to come to unwind, relax, rejuvenate and renew one's self! The Grotto is the coolest place ever!!! If you have never had one, you should call and book it. It is super fun to do with friends and your skin is left feeling like butter afterwards. I recommend this place to everyone I know and it surprises me when people have not had the chance to experience this wonderful place.",AlwayzLa8
50,Best spa around!,"I have been coming here for a year now and it's finally time to give a review. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. The massage therapists are miracle workers on my tense, overworked muscles. I always leave feeling reborn and soothed.The spa attractions are what keeps me coming back. I recommend coming for your appointment early so you can sit in the Jacuzzi or steam room! I am definitely signing up for a membership now that the staff has built such a great connection with me. They know all of the members by name and are always so welcoming to every single person that walks in. Keep up the great work, this has become my favorite place!",gigidynamite
50,Such a beautiful and serene place!!!! Hidden paradise!!!,"From the appointment booking to checking out, this is a top notch day spa. The staff is so professional and attentive to your needs. The spa is absolutely gorgeous!!! There is a separate women and men facility including a steam room and spa. They are set with showers and the amenities to come in and have a service and get ready to go straight to dinner!!!! The front desk staff offers cold towels and cucumber slices for your eyes while you rest in the spa. My massage was above par!! It was a 20 on a scale of 1-10!!! I cannot say enough about this facility!! You need to see for yourself!!!! You won't be sorry!!!!",Hollywood1001
10,The worst experience at a Spa,"Just had the worst experience I've ever had at a Spa. I was supposed to have a date night with my boyfriend to celebrate a special day and ended up leaving the place crying because of these ladies at the front desk making fun of our personal situation. Two out of the three ladies that were at the front desk were looking (staring) at me and laughing. I even had to ask one of them if there was anything wrong and she acted like she was just looking at her screen. Super unprofessional ladies and the manager did not say a word to me. I would definitely not recommend this place. I left the place without getting a massage but I would never spend my money into this unprofessional place.I would recommend this fancy place to get a better front desk staff. They should invest some money in their customer service, I see I'm not the only one complaining about it.",Paola Z
10,Worst Day Spa ever!,"Seriously the worst day spa ever, due to infighting amongst the owner/spa director and the poor non management employees that are treated like minions! Really sad, as this used to be a good spa! The turn over is constant now. Life is too short to go to a drama ridden spa and be treated poorly when there are so many other great spas in the area with NO drama!",Peggy H
30,Make sure nothing is broken before you schedule,"This place is going down hill.My husband and I have been here a few times for a couples massage and grotto treatments.The couples room that you pay extra for is really nice but it's not always available.When you book your appointment make sure you ask if there are any spa services that are broken down because you may think your going to spend spa prices but only get your treatment .During our recent trip the sauna was broken in the men's side and we were not informed of this prior to booking two expensive spa days. The sauna in the women's side did not get hot, no matter how much steam there was.They seem to be selling a lot of ""memberships"" and are therefore not aiming their customer service at taking care of infrequent visitors.",GarysJen
50,Love this place!,"This was one of those ""I can't wait to do that again"" experiences. I am not usually a spa person but I made the most of this day and thoroughly enjoyed my time.We started the experience by separating to gender based lockers and a Jacuzzi. I spent a crazy amount of time on my side showering, Jacuzzi time, relaxing, and then came out to the central courtyard for more lounging. My wife was wondering what happened to me.Once in the courtyard, I was offered beverages and towels. I pretty much made myself into a towel mummy and totally relaxed. A few teas and concoctions later we were off to the mud bath room.The mud bath area is amazing. You apply mud to your body and your friend and the sit in heat. This soaks in and you begin to feel like mush. We then washed the mud off and went into a cavern type room where I promptly fell asleep! Amazing.The staff were extremely helpful, friendly, and accommodating. We will be back!",zkrscasa
40,Loyal Customer,I go here about every two to three months for a treatment and the staff is always friendly and the reservation process is user friendly on the internet.,sfvres
20,"Poor management, uncomfortable co mingling","This used to be Glen Ivy, make no mistake it's no longer a part of that company. This day spa changed hands a few years ago and has never been the same. It's clean enough, and the massage therapists are okay, but it has some definite drawbacks. First of all, it's for men and women, so the common area, or "" solarium"" has people co mingling in robes with little underneath. Very uncomfortable. Also, the desk staff is undertrained, and the manager, Christine, is very terse and unfriendly. The owner is completely unreceptive to customer complaints and defends his managers poor behavior and total lack of skill in running a day spa. Go elsewhere in Valencia for a relaxing spa day, especially if you're female.",elisavann
40,Relaxing Retreat in Santa Clarita,"I've gone to The Ivy Day Spa numerous times since moving to this area 4 years ago. I've had facials, massages, manicures and pedicures, and it never disappoints. The staff is friendly and helpful, the facility is beautiful and peaceful, and the services and products are top-notch. I've informed my family that whenever they are wondering what to give me as a gift, they will never go wrong with a gift card from The Ivy Day Spa.",ct2camom
