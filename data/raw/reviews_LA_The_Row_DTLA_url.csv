10,Huge Disappointment,"Saturday with the debut of MarketMarket here, a mostly vintage clothing and assorted other oddities but no critical mass of purpose, people or interest; backdrop Row DTLA which could be so much but is totally off the mark. Most spaces yet to open; many which are open, despite their signs saying so, were closed. Those that are open were just mostly the same...could have put them together in one big space and even then, weird stuff and top prices. Nice to see local designers have a space, but what was available to purchase was mostly of a type, not mine, and mostly similar. Restaurants MIA; did enjoy lunch at the Japanese fried chicken place, but the bakery and restaurant I once visited, now gone. Really needs help with getting some life breathed into it. Such a great redo of an industrial space, but given its way out of the way location, no reason to go here now. Get it together Row DTLA. Came again because of the MarketMarket debut, which was a real bust. Sadly disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
50,Up and Coming LA hotspot,"The Row DTLA is instantly becoming a cool hotspot in downtown Los Angeles. The area is growing quickly as more and more shops open up. The area itself is becoming more gentrified so everything has a splash of newness and family friendly. From cute coffee shops to tasty restaurants, there is a bit something for everyone. I spend most days there working out of Shopify and wandering around. Itâ€™s a lot of fun and visual eye candy everywhere.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iamcjjohnsonjr
50,Alameda Supper Club,"Warehouses restored to urban beauty. The highlights of our group dinner were: the grilled bread from Tartine, a vibrant green salad, sea bream with fennel, lamb belly with chimichurri, mushrooms we all fought over, strozzapreti with sheep cheese and preserved lemon, and for dessert, buckwheat cannoli of ricotta with sour cherries and pistachio. The sommelier was both knowledgable & helpful. fun spot. The outside seats look nice if the weather is right,.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johngR1622GR

50,Trendy and fun,Great new development repurposing old warehouses. A great collection of shops and restaurants including Tartine which itself is worth a visit. Also holds the Smorgasburg every Sunday. Free parking. Definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamS967
40,"An evolving shopping, eating destination.","Row DTLA is a destination in the making. One of my favorite shops is the wine shop. Staff is friendly and selection good. Boutiques are interesting and there is plenty of parking. The warehouse setting is a great example of re-purposing. I look forward to its continued growth,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenetskyshev
50,Fun Place,"Spend a fun, and relaxing day at the Row DTLA. You can window shop, spend time at cafes or restaurants. Easy and convenient parking structure. Good for family with children. The area is still ""under construction"" and very soon there will be more shops and restaurants.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daba2010
50,VERY FUN industrial pocket of Downtown LA,"Parking - first hour is free, first two hours are free with validation from any retail or restaurant in the Row. There is an entrance into the parking structure to the left. Another entrance going straight for any rideshare drop offs or delivery.Shops/Restaurants - lots of fun things to look at and eat. A great variety of shops and foods. Lots of spots to sit outside and enjoy lovely weather. I would think even more things will open here over time. Seems like there are many offices on-site as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/imskimmy
