50,A lot of gift ideas,"One of the best museum gift shops . I found a lot of gift ideas here for my family friends and myself. Interesting and unique jewelry, teas, bags , post cards and much much more .",Annaline
50,Friendliest Staff Ever,I didn't shop here but have to give a shoutout to how nice the staff is here. I needed a place to put my luggage while switching Airbnb's during my stay in the LA area and they came to the rescue. I asked the Huntington Library staff and they said if it doesn't fit in one of their lockers they couldn't help me out. I then went to this store and asked the same thing and Maria said it would be no problem. They put my bags in the back and I was able to spend the whole day at Huntington.,Mark P
50,Fantastic !,"A great experience to enjoy, there is a broad range of items,something for every interest and price point. So nice to findexciting items that are not mass produced for tourists.",989emmettm
40,Not your average museum shop.,"Large, spacious area contains a number of quality items for every price range. A step above the usual museum gift shop. A good place to get souvenirs of a visit to a great museum. Many of the gifts are themed to parts of the Huntington.",AZ1912
40,"Lots of good options, but very pricy","The Huntington Store has lots of fun, pretty, cool, and more stuff for all ages and all in different categories. The Huntington store is extremely PRICY! Things cost WAY TOO MUCH!",Nate
50,Something for every price range,The Huntington Museum Store has something for every price range: from moderate to incredibly wealthy! Their items are extremely unique and well-made. If you join I think there's like a 10% discount. If you don't like spending any money then don't go in! But go to all the gardens and museums at the library.,Erudite_journey
50,Hunt Through Huntington Gift Shop,"The Huntington Garden Gift store is a great place to find unusual and fairly high quality cards, gifts or souvenirs of your visit to the Huntington Gardens. It has a beautiful collection of scarves, though pricey and an unusual collection of Beatrix Potter memorabilia during the Spring. It is organized in specialized alcoves, e.g., Art Nouveau/Deco, Asian, Children, jewelry. It is a great place to shop for unusual gift items during the holidays. It seems less ""tacky"" than the usual museum gift shops or souvenir stores.",Dessertarian44
50,Shop for Art,The store has a broad variety of gifts and souvenirs. Buy a tome about California history or browse the many other books for sale. There is a broad range of gifts and all are so artful. A good way to end a visit to the Huntington and bring home a bit of remembrance.,1dudley
40,High end souvenir and gift shop,"Nice place when you want something more special or thoughtful for someone, both young and older. A wide selection of books, toys and gifts displayed to topic",Hagar08540
50,Well worth a visit!,"This store has a large range of interesting and beautiful items, from home goods to jewelry to children's toys. It is much more extensive than the average museum shop.",Judy F
50,Simply the Best,"What a lovely way to spend an afternoon. The museum, gardens, and especially the bookstore. The Huntington store has everything you would love to have. All price ranges.Books and postcards. A wonderful childrenâ€™s section. Serious and whimsy. Seasonal....Christmas, Easter, and other holidays. Quite enchanting! Something for everyone.",Mel526
50,Excellent Museum Store,This is probably the best museum store we have seen anywhere. We are returning just to spend more time in it. It is huge and divided into sections by theme. The variety is excellent. We especially want to look at the books and probably take some home. The nearby ice cream shop is nice and the cafe a short walk away is also excellent. No admission fee for any of these.,tallpinesCO
50,A MAGNIFICENT GARDEN AND MUSEUM STORE,"It is only right that the Huntington Store represent both the museum and gardens in selection for the visitor. Indeed, it accomplishes this. It exceeded my expectations. I thought it would just be your ""typical"" museum store with token garden selections. Quite the contrary, the gardens are front and center as you enter the store (literally).We were there on a group tour so the museum was closed and only the gardens were open just for us. It was wonderful that they also opened the store for us for a limited number of hours. Upon entering, you will view a large collection of garden paraphernalia. Then, to the right, you will find a complete room of garden gifts as well.To the left, you will also find the museum well represented. Give yourself plenty of time (after visiting the museum and gardens) to dawdle throughout the store.",johnnnita
50,The most incredible selection,"I will return to the Huntington Store often. They have a wonderful selection of unique gifts, personal souvenirs, teas, and children's selections. I love to keep unique greeting cards for all occasions on hand, and The Huntington Store is now my ""go-to"" shop for greeting cards. Prices are very fair for the items, and in fact, I have paid more for handcrafted items. Shhh. Don't tell them, their prices are quite good!",agoodsign
50,Good museum store,The Huntington collection store has a good array of gift and garden items. Well displayed and good prices; some unique items too. I always go there to do Christmas shopping because they get a great variety of ornaments you won't find anywhere else.,Cheryl G
50,"So many ""pretties"" to purchase!!!","Naturally we had to roam through the gift shop at The Huntington. Such a nice, beautiful selection of gifts you do not see anywhere else. Oh yes, purchase""s"" were made here. Very friendly staff.",nancylucille
50,A quaint little shop,A quaint shop with really beautiful and interesting things to take back as a memento or gift. I loved browsing through all the lovely stuff they had.,M-Dasgupta
50,Great place for kids and adults of all ages,We stopped at the shop after spending many hours in the gardens and museums. We had our grandchildren with us (aged 3.5 and 1 year old). The kids particularly enjoyed the children's section where they got to pick one gift. But the whole shop in filled with wonderful items.,Sa-i44
50,Love this store,"The architecture is wonderful and it makes the shopping experience pleasant. There is sooooo much to see but it is all nicely organized. Each section has a lot to look at...the tea area is books, paper ware, tea cups etc. Be sure to look up at the tea cup chandelier. The things for kids is wonderful. Clever and educational.",Toni I
40,Pricey but Great Selection,"This museum store has many fun items as well as the usual books, toys, and souvenirs. Overall this store features a large selection attractively and appealingly displayed.",GlobalGypsy_13
