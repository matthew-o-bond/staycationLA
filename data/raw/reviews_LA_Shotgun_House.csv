50,Fascinating,"This tiny little house was meticulously restored and filled with photos that give a little insight into what Santa Monica was like in days gone by. It's a 2 minute walk from Main Street. The docents are so knowledgable and willing to share their love of the building and the community.This is the kind of place you can wander in for 5 minutes or spend an hour. So tiny, kids may even have patience for this and find it amazing that is was a real house.",Terri S
50,Santa Monica Shotgun House,"Tucked behind the Ocean Park Branch of the Santa Monica Library. A little known gem and piece of history stands beautifully and loving restored by the hands of people with a passion to retain the essence of a long gone era of Santa Monica history.Small, cute, packed with photos and history. There are docents at all times to educate you as much as you wish. A good one hour rest from the hustle and bustle of Main Street. Wish it would be more advertised and more people would know about it. It is a real find.",sunstonetours

40,Has it moved?,This shotgun house is a fine example to so many beach bungalows from early Santa Monica. I read somewhere that the Shotgun house moved to the Santa Monica airport.,SMOgal
50,Early 'Shotgun' house preserved from historic Santa Monica neighborhood,"Shotgun houses were the early twentieth century's version of a modern mobile home, but without wheels. They were long and narrow, easy to construct, inexpensive, and some even came in kit form. The Santa Monica Conservancy has preserved one of these iconic architectural dwellings, moving it in one piece from a nearby historic neighborhood. The house is home to the Conservancy's Preservation Resource Center and serves as a showcase of adaptive reuse. The house is open to the public 11 am â€“ 2 pm Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. A scale model of how the house would have looked when original is on display. On visiting days a docent is on duty to present its history.",Merrill C
