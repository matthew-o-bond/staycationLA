40,Wedding bliss,"I attended a wedding here and it was a worthwhile experience: from the well manicured greens to the phenomenal decor and the notably good service. I however, had higher expectations as far as the food was concerned. It was ok, but not 5 star worthy. I will definitely be back for a round of golf, though.",Mwalimu Esther
40,cool breeze from pacific,"Weather was so gorgeous it was little cold in the morning, but afternoon it was so perfact.You could see catalina island from golf course just like picture, people rideing boat at ocean.People call this golf course is poor mans pebble beach. I really enjoyed lot and had good time.",james c
50,Amazing Convo,I'm at the super genius he shot me an idea the word you can hit golf balls out into the ocean and after 24 to 48 hours the golf balls will just turn the fish food it's a great idea I was very fortunate to meet a bright man I hope someone steals that idea hahahaha,Peter M
40,"Great course, if you have 6 hours.","Awesome municipal course with great views and good greens, either tee off very early or come with a lot of patience.Back 9 on weekends is the way to go, quick 90-100 minute 9 holes with great views and you're home before breakfast.",Reza S
50,Outstanding views on a challenging golf course!,"First off, I was floored that you can bring an ice chest! Now as for the course, it was outstanding for the price paid. Very challenging and in excellent shape. The views from hole 14 were insane! I highly recommend it, but know play is slow. Cheers!",Randy J B
40,Great public course,Los Verdes is a great public course with amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. You can't beat this price for what you get. It can be slow sometimes but has been better recently.,MBEM
50,Most Beautiful Public Golf Course,"I am lucky and not living far away from the Course. On a warm and sunny dayIt is heaven on earth but it can also be foggy and cold. So, check the weather report.The Fairways are very well kept and the players are mostly very nice, if you have to join a group of men. Of course, I prefer to just play with another woman. There is only one problem, the Course is very popular and most of the time very crowded. I sometimes manage to get a tee time in the afternoon to play just 9 holes. On a beautiful day this Course rivals with Hawaii because of it's amazing views.",barbelq
30,poor customer service,"arrived early on Sunday before a golf tournament, The first negative experience was trying to get breakfast. Went to the dining room, ordered breakfast special. There was only one person working doing three jobs, dining room server, snack bar and bar tender. After 25 minutes, and no breakfast delivered to the table, i left. I was later told by a regular Sunday golfer that the service is very poor there. The second was the person working in the golf shop. He was definitely under the influence of some chemical substance, slurring his words and not sure of the prices for golf.The third issue was the bald tires on the golf cart.Fairways are weedy and uneven greens and tees are kept well. The ocean view is nice on a few holes.",traveler714025
50,Amazing views,One of the most beautiful public golf courses in Southern California. The price is also surprisingly reasonable.,Cory S
50,Public golf course with fantistic view,"Hard to get in for tea time. Driving ranch is great. It is a public golf course. View is great even if you don't play golf, just hang around.",cjean168
50,Barney Podlaski,"Great track! Great condition! Staff always courteous and helpful. Wonderful ocean views from just about any place on the course. The $ will be a pleasant surprise. Call ahead, lots of tournaments.",Barney P
40,"""PALOS VERDES CONCOURS""","Beautiful golf course. We enjoyed the various cars at the car show. The parking required a shuttle and it needed air conditioning or better ventilation. Over all it was a great day to view cars,the golf course, soak up some sun and drink wine.",GUCCI415
40,Nice Ocean views,"Play LV at least once a week, and find the course to always be in great shape.It is not called the poor mans Pebble Beach for no reason.",RPVWilly
50,What a beautiful place to play golf.,"This public ourse has some great ocean views. Well maintained fairways and greens. This is a very challenging course. Putting on these greens is treacherous. Ball seems to want to go towards the ocean - even uphill!! Pace of play was about 5 hours which is average for an early morning round. But afternoon rounds can take 6 hours. Very reasonable green fees, but getting a staring time on weekends is almost impossible. Much easier during the week. But play early. they have a two deck driving range and a full service coffee shop.",berniek1949
50,Great tee location and the price is right,"If you love to golf and the view, this is the place, price is right @42 each with a cart! Nice and easy course and view of the ocean in many tee. There are home around it too, very green. This is a golf ultimate destination in LA.",Sugaylange
50,Public Course on the Hill,"Excellent course but be prepared for a long round of golf! However, if you prepare yourself for that you will enjoy a beautiful day.",Laura R
30,Nice course in poor condition,"The drought in California is really ruining this course which I've loved for the last 40 years. There is no reclaimed water so every drop used on the course costs a fortune now. As a result the fairways are bone dry and almost devoid of grass. Especially on hole 13 even the best tee shot can end up rolling a fairway away onto hard pan. Not a pleasure to play now, although the views of Catalina remain spectacular. I'm sure it will improve if El Ni√±o ever arrives.",UltimateWines
30,It is just an average driving rang..,"A typical driving range that I was just happened to be at with my friends. I guess if you are local then it might be a good place. But if you are coming from elsewhere, this whole Rancho Palos Verdes is a far far away from freeway..",Da M
40,Great ocean views!,"I went with my husband, bro-in-law, and nephew during Super Bowl and it wasn't too crowded. The greens were in great shape, but everything breaks towards the ocean-hard to put. The ocean views are greats and of course great LA weather.",MJ_EBs007
40,Enjoyable Public Course - But get out early!,"Spectacular views for a public course, and very reasonable greens fees. Visited as an out of town weekday golfer and enjoyed the whole round very much. Pro shop and restaurant both very helpful with information and equipment/food suggestions at reasonable prices. Groups of 5 permissible and first tee times go out before the sun rises. Previous reviews about slow play later in day completely accurate and thank you for that advice - right on the money.",Dan A
30,Downhill fairways,"Surprisingly the pace of play here last Sunday was good for this public course. Since they routinely book walking fivesomes it's not unusual to take 6 plus hours to finish here. We started at 9:20 and only had long waits on the par threes to hit. Unfortunately the condition of the fairways and greens have deteriorated to an alarming degree. I'm assuming the ongoing water shortage is the reason for so many dried out and bare ground areas but I don't know why the greens were so bumpy. The practice putting greens were fine. The course fairways are starting to look like the bare dirt and grass patchwork, weed filled fairways at The Links at Victoria Park. Some cart paths are still under repair so some minor constructions zones exist. The men's looker room bathroom still stinks. The beautiful ocean views remain as this courses' main attraction.",playnorm
30,Round of golf.,"Our tee time was 11:30am but was pushed back to 12:30pm because they were behind. The course plays real SLOW, more than 3 hours for the front nine and another 3 hours for the back! You wait for every shot. Beautiful views of the ocean on some holes, gets cool near sunset. Bring a picnic basket or something to read between shots. Not sure I'd return to play unless I had an early tee time.",Gary T
40,Beautiful Course! Pebble South!,"Los Verdes is as beautiful a public course as you will ever find. There are mature trees, interesting layout and ocean views... All said, 4 stars only because it is hard to get a tee time (I play it in local charity tournaments) and it usually takes 5+ hours to play! That is common in public golf in Los Angeles, but this is definitely an uncommon public course!",Sherlock9190
50,"Views, views,views","Best public course in LA. Challenging with unbeatable ocean and Catalina views. Nice diner for food or drinks, full bar.",Paul M
50,Great course for little cost,You won't find a more beautiful public course anywhere. The links roll in and out of the local hills along the ocean. Spectacular views!,Vic_and_Leila
50,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I golf at least weekly at Los Verdes and am always cheered by the view of Catalina Island and the Channel (when it's not fogged in). LV has completed a million dollar workover over the course in which they have modified, moved and installed new bunkers. And they have replaced the old, brown sand with the white softer stuff. Also the cart path has been repaired and bare spots reseeded. Currently LV is under a water restriction by which they have reduced water for the rough by 15%. Unfortunately that has resulted in a rather sparse and hard rough. But it's well maintained and, for the most part, players are considerate enough to rake the bunkers. My main complaint is, and has been for years, that they have interminable tournaments; at least one almost every day. That makes tee times a bit hard to come by at times. But, considering the value and quality I will continue to deal with that. Their pro staff is always friendly and considerate. Sometimes I wonder how they manage the smile with the business they're faced with.",LHANN2013
40,Slow play but do you care with a view like this?,"Coming from the Midwest we don't get the chance to play on a course where almost every hole gives you a breath-taking view of the ocean. The course was extremely busy and we HAD to play with three other people. Fortunately, we had a great group of guys to play with.The play was so slow it took us about 3 hours to play 9 holes. The course is in pretty good condition. There are a few holes with construction but overall I would recommend playing here. Just make sure to make a reservation and still be prepared to wait.You might get a cheaper rate using golfzing.com but I couldn't get it to work.",Toni M
40,Nice course,Nice course. Green are great. Very enjoyable outing if you are into golf. My husband and friends always have a great day.,Anna U
30,Nice ocean views but slow play,"Very busy course and difficult to get tee times. Not sure why ....nice course and always in good conditions. A few holes with beautiful views with the ocean as a backdrop, but the slow pace of play kills any positives...especially on the front 9. Avoid playing here on the weekends! Slow slow slow...",RP507
30,One of the Best County Courses but Slooooooow.,"One of the best county courses, nicely laid out and in decent shape for a public course. The pace is very slow and plan on a 5 1/2 hour round. Driving range is not great but you can at least warm up. Driving range balls are a mixed bag, mostly bad.",rjgagliano
20,Slow,Playing golf at Los Verdes is painfully slow. The greens are is poor condition and it seems they never roll them.,MBEM
40,Great Golf,"This is our favorite place to play. I always hear complaints about how its always backed up, but we have never experienced that problem. Greens are well maintained. Beautiful ocean views. What more could you ask for?",klewis0906
50,LOS VERDES-BEST SECRET IN THE SOUTH BAY,"This is a great, well kept course. They installed a computerized irrigation system about three years ago and they are now in the process of upgrading the bunkers and tee boxes. The back nine has been completed and the front will be done this year. They do an excellent job with the renovations and play disruption is kept to a minimum. On a clear day the view is magnificent. You can see from Long Beach to Point Magu, including the Channel Islands. It is a moderately difficult course, one that can be enjoyed by all handicaps. I have played there one to two times per week for the last 15 years and never tire of the course and the beautiful scenery. Since this is a county course the fees are extremely low.",LHANN2013
50,Simple and Beautiful,"The 9 hole, par 3 course allows for golfers of various levels to enjoy the course. If you play two rounds, you'll get in your regular 18 holes. It's so beautiful you won't mind.",C C
50,Never Gets Old!!!,"This tour is the best PV has to offer. Today was my 6th visit in 8 years! The crew always goes out of their way to make sure everyone has a good time! Davecho, Pablo, Jorge, Alexa and all the rest are the best!!From the onset this trip is fun. The bus ride up offers beautiful views of the city and ocean. Once you arrive the guides always put on an entertaining show while giving you the rules. The tour takes you soaring through the jungle with gorgeous views of the river.Once the zip lining is done you arrive back to the restaurant. Yummy food and drinks are available. My kids always enjoy swimming in the crystal clear river. The rock slides are always a good time.You can feed the monkeys, have an iguana sit on your head or hold a snake.This tour is a MUST when in PV.Thanks for another great trip again today! See you in a year or two!!!!",steph1298
10,CAN YOU SAY ‚Ä¶ S ‚Ä¶ SLOW?,The setting is SPECTACULAR ‚Ä¶ many holes hugging the Pacific with views from many holes including the 15th Hole. But you won't get to finish your round of golf in 4 1/2 HOURS rather you'll need 6 HOURS!NOT WORTH THE BOTHER. If you must try it once ‚Ä¶ I'm certain YOU'LL NEVER RETURN. An indifferent pro-shop ‚Ä¶ who couldn't care less if you're waiting 5 minutes or more on each hole ‚Ä¶ there's NO ONE around to keep the pace of play to a reasonable time ‚Ä¶ they even allow 5-somes to play!NOT WORTH THE EFFORT ‚Ä¶ if you must ‚Ä¶ just go and look at the views and leave ‚Ä¶ a total waste of time!,Stan056
