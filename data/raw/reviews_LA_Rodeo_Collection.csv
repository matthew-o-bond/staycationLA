40,Get a Sandwich Downstairs!!,"There is an AWESOME sandwich shop downstairs beside the valet called Johnny Sandwich... it was one of the BEST meals I had in California. It's a small shop - practically a window - where we waited quite a while for our two sandwiches and of course paid an arm & a leg. But worth it: I got turkey bacon on baguette, served with a side of DELICIOUS potato salad. Totally hit the spot both as a great meal and economic given the prices of everything else in the area!",Jodel

10,Piazza Rodeo,"My girlfriend and I took her brother and his girlfriend who were visiting from Germany to the Piazza Rodeo restaurant for coffee/drinks and received an attitude from the hostess since we only wanted drinks. They then brought over the dessert tray and we declined and the hostess/waitress told the other waiter ""of course they don't want dessert"" right in front of us!This attitude is beyond what I would expect from any restaurant, but particularly one located on Rodeo drive in Beverly Hills. They also automatically add gratuity to the bill and we declined to pay this as a result of the bad service. We certainly will not go back there and do not recommend such a place to anyone who is looking to be treated with respect.",MAC_LA1
