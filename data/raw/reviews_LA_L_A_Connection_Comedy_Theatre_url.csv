40,All Evening Long,"The address for this theater is at 3435 Magnolia in Burbank. Trip Advisor has it incorrect!They start around eight in the evening and members of the audience are welcome to stay. Each hour a different improv group takes the stage.Last Saturday it was a mixed bag. The first group we watched was by far the funniest. My friend and I are in an improv troupe and we knew all the conventions and thought our group bested them in some of their skits.That being said, having this enthusiastic improv company here in the neighborhood is a plus. They also have great prices for admission especially if you make an evening of it and it is LIVE theater!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SCSZ41
50,The best improv in the city!,"All the shows are hilarious but the 9pm Saturday show is hysterical. These folks know improv and are a local treasure. A MUST see! Alumni include Will Ferrell, Matthew Perry and Josh Groban.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T2675DPtonyc
