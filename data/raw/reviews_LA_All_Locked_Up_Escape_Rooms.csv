50,All Locked Up in the Immersion!,"THE GARAGE:Such a fun and visually stimulating room!When we got there, there was plenty of parking in the lot and the location was easy to find. The lobby was clean and had free lockers for us to store our personal items in. We signed our waivers, watched a rules video, and then got our room introduction.The Room: I have never seen a room entrance so grand and in-theme as this one. We were in awe watching as the room was revealed before us. Decoration for this room is vast. The theme was Garage, so obviously anything you would expect to see in a garage is in this room. We kept finding new things as we explored we added to our fun!The Puzzles: Having done over 70 escape rooms it is hard to find puzzles that really stand out. And while The Garage did have some of the usual lock and key puzzles, they also included tech based puzzles which were woven flawlessly into the game flow. And I am happy to say that there were some puzzles that we had never seen before!Customer Service: The owners were unbelievably kind and welcoming. They even chatted with us after our room for an hour, which we always appreciate. They welcomed any feedback we had about the room, and even informed us about thier future rooms. You can tell that they are passionate about what they do, which as a customer and enthusiast is very reassuring the hear.THE CLASSROOMHaving done The Garage, we were very excited to hear of the announcement of the brand new room: The Classroom. Did I mention this room has three different levels to play at: beginner, intermediate, and expert. Of course my group saw the 0% (so far) escape rate ""expert mode"" and we were immediatlyey drawn to it. Would we be the first to make it out??? (Spoiler alert: Nope, we didn't escape it)The Room: Ever wanted to travel back to your good old middle/high school day? This room will take you back with its desks, flooring, and all the classic classroom decor you can think of! We felt like we had just broken into a real classroom. All Locked Up does a fantastic job at set design in both The Garage and Classroom.The Puzzles: Let me begin by saying, we did not make it out. However, we did get to the final puzzle. We wasted a good amount of time in the beginning of the room due to the fact that we were taking in all the decorations and figuring out what was just decor and what was a part of a puzzle. Once we got the ball rolling the puzzles began to sort them selves out. Biggest thing that held us back was us thinking that each ""key"" only went to one ""lock"". We were told the ""expert mode"" has only been in operation for about a week so I am sure with more groups doing it, small tweaks will be made in order to enhance the game flow.Customer Service: The owners here are some of the most personable, friendly, and genuinely kind escape room owners my group and I have had the pleasure to come into contact with. You can see their passion reflected in the decoration and immersion of the rooms. On top of this, they were more than willing to explain parts of the room to us that we got confused on, and they were open to suggestions on possible ways to improve and ""Kayla-proof"" the room. It's always a nice thing when enthusiast groups are able to converse with owners after playing a room. After all, as a player you see the room in such a different way than creators do.Overall, if you are in the area and looking to be fully immersed in either The Garage or The Classroom, check this place out! Also by having 3 different levels for this room, that means that you can come back a play different puzzles each time! I would recommend starting at the lower level and working your way up, that way you get a feel for the room flow early on. My group and I are very excited to come back and try the other levels of this room. We are also looking forward to the opening of Aunt Debbie's Apartment-- feel free to let us know if you need beta testers!",Kayla H
