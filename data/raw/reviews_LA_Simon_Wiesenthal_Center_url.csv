50,YOU FEEL CONFIDENT IN HUMAN KIND,"After getting lost in the worst page of human history: THE HOLOCAUST TIMELINE and you breath and touch the subhumane degree men and women have turned to... then when you're sure everything is lost and you have no space, time and hope left then you are captured by this man who has given a name, a land, a dignity and a reason to live for to all humane. THANKS A LOT. MEMORY CARRIERS",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candidocal
50,Must see for all people,What is gratifying when you visit the Museum of Tolerance is the varied ethnic background of the visitors and how moved everybody seemed to be watching the terrible story of the Holocaust unfold. Equally excellent is the very special ANNE FRANK exhibition. What a unique young girl she was. Highly recommended,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigvicSydney
50,"Check out this museum , since we already visited a few around the world","We got to museum this Morning at 10:30 am, but there were so many school buses full of students that there was. I room for us. Better to buy tickets on line ahead of time, go to their website .So we bought 2 tickets for 1:30 pm, and decided to walk to rodeo Drive to kill time and maybe stop for lunch.We found CPK, and had a nice lunch.We walked around and came back for 1:30 pm.We joined a few school groups ho had a guide.This is a must See Museum, a learning experience,To see how cruel the world is to mnorities, and how people are brainwashed to believe their "" leaders""!It dwells mostly on the Horiffic Holocaust , but also has good facts on other aspects of world history of other atrocities.A must see for history buffs, very painful to sit through many snippets of real movies , seeing Hitler up close , and experiencing and trying to imagine how it was before the war and during, it shows u life before, in small villages how people went about their daily lives, then when Hitler started to gain power , and invade countries and make laws against Jewidh people, very emotional scenes.But there are 3 floors, and a variety of things to watch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SunshineMontreal
40,Simon's Memory Center ...,"I've visited a number of times before and always learn so much more about the Holocaust, an inexhaustible somber subject. We owe Simon Wisenthal a great debt for his lifelong quest to unearth information about the Shoah & to identify the perpetrators, however long the time. Most meaningful are recollections by survivors and the opportunity to speak with them - priceless experience! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Well done-very moving,This is one of the best museums on the holocaust.I found the style of each section drawing you into that time to be an excellent way to describe how this tragedy could have occurred.Having visited s number of museums on this topic I find this style to be one of the best.Being given a card of an individual to follow a personal story was also a great way to appreciate this part of history.Facility is very nice and parking on site makes it easy to have access.Well done.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TAMAN1951
50,A must visit for all,My daughter & I recently toured a section of the museum. It was a very profound & emotional visit. I would have liked to have spent more time there. I do plan on returning the next time I am in LA.I highly recommend visiting this museum & bring your children. It is a very moving experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/934debbys
50,Change your world view,"Absolutely everyone needs to take a few hours of their life and be here. You will be a better person for it. Teach your children: tolerance, compassion, peace, have a voice, love & appreciate one another.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1hotMeM
30,A valiant effort...but it didn't stir us like other venues with a similar focus.,"My wife and I have previously visited the concentration camp sites of Auschwitz and Dachau, and I have visited the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. These were very moving experiences for us. We were curious what the Museum of Tolerance might present. We attended an informative 1-hour talk by a holocaust survivor, which was the highlight of our visit. We were somewhat put off by the enforced pacing of visitors in the holocaust portion of the museum: doors automatically open and close to shepherd visitors from one area to another after audiovisual presentations in each section. This section of the museum could be informative to people who are unfamiliar with the holocaust and who would be receptive to a broad-brush overview. But the presentation did not evoke in us the empathetic emotional reactions that the other memorials we have visited did, perhaps because there were no compelling visual displays that allowed for self-paced reflection.A second section has a broader focus, emphasizing the need for tolerance. It mostly relies on displayed text, images, and a few interactive stations. It's wide-ranging focus trends toward superficial coverage...a survey rather than a spotlight. For us the latter would have been more compelling.If you have been to the other holocaust memorial sites such as those mentioned above and/or you are already informed of the events related to the holocaust, you could probably by-pass this museum in favor of other cultural opportunities in Los Angeles. If you are curious about what happened during those horrible times, you can learn quite a bit from a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/awkr897
50,An absolute must see for every generation,A truly moving experience for our entire party that ranged from 9 to 76. You simply must attend one of the talks from a holocaust survivor if you have the chance. We all listened intently for an hour and could have listened for another few hours. Be prepared to be moved to tears even if you are not normally. A memorable experience for all. Thank You so much.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrB1966
40,Make reservations and then enjoy,"My visit started on a sour note as they initially turned me away for not having reservations. Seems that there were some school groups and they were full. I made reservations for some hours later and returned.Also, the museum does not permit food, drinks, cameras and any sharp objects (all understandable) but they provide no place to put them if you bring them by mistake. Therefore, everything goes in the garbage. The guard told me that a whole group had brought Swiss army knives the day before and they all went in the trash bin. They definitely should have lockers outside the admission area. They mercifully allowed me to bring in my camera with the promise that I wouldn't photograph anything. (I didn't)The museum is fascinating and well designed. Very informative, original and interactive. My 12-y.o. son, who is very hard to please, found it interesting and worthwhile and even agreed that it would be good to try to see the one we have here in NY.The restaurant was a bonus for us as it is not only kosher but good food, nice choices and reasonable prices.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chofetzchaim
40,very moving experience,did not start off to well as did not take my passport and a very rude security guard would not let me in to park but on entrance all ok took a guided tour with a group and was there for a very informative couple of hours with exhibits videos and a very knowing guide you have to go i dare you not to be moved,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stelai_11
50,Well worth a visit,"This has something for every age, and is staffed by people who care. From learning about immigration for the younger set (an LA version of the NYC Tenement Museum tour), to being reminded about prejudice and hatred of every type for all ages, you can't go wrong at this moving yet still pleasant museum. Because we had a smaller child with us, we did not go through the part on the Holocaust; even without it, it was a worthwhile and thought-provoking experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/winwoid
50,A Moving and Lasting Experience,This is an awesome museum that will shed light to anyone. Words can't describe this powerful experience. A must for everyone who wants to see what history has to tell and not to repeat it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nycres
50,This is a superb museum and a must to learn and never forget,"If you have the time, do yourself and your family a favor and visit this excellent, very modern and impressively organized museum. The message is powerful, so well delivered in a very creative interactive way, and so important.There is ample free underground parking too, so this makes the visit very convenient.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Steven123
40,Great Museum,"As previously said, the experience was moving but very traumatic. However, the message is so important that everyone should visit. Very interactive, non-traditional. Not boring at all. However, it was hard for me to find restrooms at all levels besides the lobby. And the cafeteria on the 4/F was mediocre, kind of dirty too.Free parking. Great books collection in the museum store. Reserve at least 3 to 4 hours for the visit. Expect lots of school kids if it's on a school day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariesgal
50,What a moving Experience,"I went with my boyfriend to the Museum of Tolerance just a few days after CA passed Prop 8. It was definitely a moving experience that day. The first floor had different exhibits dedicated to tolerance of different races, cultures, genders, sexual preferences, and religion. At that moment, and even now, there is was a huge backlash against CA voters passing Prop 8 to limit the rights of a minority group. Anyway...that was only the start of it all.The chief example and purpose of the museum of Tolerence was based on the Holocaust . It plotted the events in Germany from ""losing"" WWI to the Final Solution to the Jews. It then took you to a Concentration Camp and to the extermination process. Hard to put it all in words. It reminded me a bit of the Museum in DC with the passport card of a Jewish person and seeing what happened to them.As depressing as it was, I am glad I went. As much as the world has changed, we still have a long way to go to really accept people who are not the same as mainstream society.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_traveller16
40,moving and disturbing,"This museum is a must see for all school kids and their teachers. The museum is divided into two learning centres. The first is about tolerance, and the displays timeline the history of human rights and discrimination in the U.S. Interactive displays allow you to go further into the subject. The Learning Centres invites discussion and learning.The Holocust museum uses a low-key Disney-ish display to tell the story of the Holocust; how and why Hitler came to power, why the Jews did not flee, why ordinary citizens willingly participated, and why some did not. It uses pictures and first person accounts to describe the ghettos, the rounding up, and transporting of Jews, Gypsies, the disabled, homosexuals and others. You can almost see what it must have been like. The tour is a brief (one hour) yet detailed overview. The tour serves as an introduction for the uninformed, a review for those who have studied, and a warning to those who are naive enough to believe it cannot happen again. As our guide pointed out, it already has, and still is.There are also special displays and shows, check the web site for updates.There is an artifacts museum on the upper floor, a cafeteria and underground, free parking. There is strict security, metal detectors, no food, drink or gum allowed inside!Well worth a visit, though you will be in a somber mood afterwards!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dream803061
