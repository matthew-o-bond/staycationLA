50,Museum of Modern Art.,"Art that enriches, they have a free auto tour that helps you to appreciate some works even more, it was a wonderful walk, you need at least 2 hours but if you can give the visit more time to take advantage of the best.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lilianasmith
50,An amazing place,"When we planned to visit LA The Broad was one of those must see attractions. We followed the advice and arrived early with our pre-booked tickets and avoided the queue. This is probably the best advice I can offer also. The queue to get in without pre-booked tickets was huge.The exhibition space is well planned and, if you follow the route set out in the guide you will see everything. The gallery also has a paid exhibition every so often and if you can, buy tickets for this also.You will find, when busy its full of people taking photographs with the exhibits and some people get quite annoyed if you spoil their shot which kind of spoils the mood here which is normally really good.The staff are helpful and knowledgeable and well happily answer questions should you have any.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DonotDreamJustTravel
40,Get Tickets in Advance OnLine,"Very nicely done, get there early as it gets very crowded toward the noon hour. As soon as you enter make sure to make reservations for the infinity room. Layout is a little confusing but everybody is very helpful. Audio tour is interesting but several areas did not work. All in all a good two hours",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBKuper
40,Overall nice,A bit small and the main attraction of the mirrors is only nice and might be with a long waiting time. Overall nice and free so totally recommended.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ophirf4
50,Very nice exhibition space,"Very nice exhibition space. Superb setting for a remarkable, varied collection, very well highlighted. Online reservations a few weeks in advance allow you to visit this museum, free, in good crowds ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nanez09
50,Perfect Spot for Modern Art Lovers,"""The Broad"" is an apt name for this museum as it presents a wide array of modern art pieces. Spanning many decades and various disciplines, there's something for everyone - of almost any age - to be seen here. Plan ahead for getting tickets (even if they're free) to see specific installations. You'll need at least two hours to do the visit justice but I'd suggest three or four to really enjoy it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/doUcopy
50,Interesting place,"If you like contemporary art, then you must visit here for sure. Stylish building. Interesting exhibitions and exhibits",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NotGonnaDieNotGonnaD
50,Don’t miss!,Incredible. Well organized given amount of crowd. Get advance pass. Really great place. Across from LA Museum of contemp art. Good two fer,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/438danieln
50,The Broad,Please go and enjoy this amazing free museum in LA. has so much to give plus is a great wait to rest from the heat.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yenyok
50,Gorgeous,Stunning architectural museum. Exhibits are on the very contemporary side. Onsite restaurant Otium is one of the best food experiences I've had. A must see if you are visiting downtown or near the financial district. Moca conveniently located across the street as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kodimykodi
50,"Great pieces from the past, and interesting modern exhibitions under 1 roof.","Free entry to see some great pieces of what would normally be someone's private art collection, this generous family set up the museum so that it was free to all visitors, You need to still book your time slot as it gets very busy and the ""stand by"" line can be long. This museum was custom built, and walking up and down the stairs you can 'sneak peak' through the glass walls into the storage facilities containing the rest of the museum's art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/763MelissaP
40,Great time wandering around ogling the famous modern art,"Enjoyed all the colorful & thought-provoking galleries, especially the Kusama exhibits. The building itself (and elevator) are really neat, too. Friendly people working at the Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leklekblue
50,"Very popular, totally worth it... great contemporary art in a stunning setting","I've been here a few times since it opened and always leave happy. It's just a great museum with an open floor plan and excellent natural light. The building's exterior... which at first looked to me like a 1960s parking garage with its pre-formed concrete panels... is really growing on me and it's lit up beautifully at night. Inside, the art is always interesting and in my opinion, puts MOCA across the street to shame, although that museum is still worth visiting. I live right next door and see daily how many people come through here... definitely make a reservation if you can. What's interesting to me is how young the crowd is here for the museum... that's probably what I like about the Broad the best. It really is attracting the next generation of art-lover (along with your typical older museum-attendee) and that's always a good thing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andrew-s-wood
40,Quick museum visit,"Parking is under the building, easy to access but expensive. We had tickets (free from website) so only a short wait to get in at opening time. Line for the infinity mirrors filled very quickly so make a reservation ahead of time. There were a lot on staff on hand and they were all pleasant and helpful. The art exhibit is only one floor the day we visited and so it was fairly quickly navigated. There were some rooms with exhibits that I would not take a child as they had some disturbing images of slavery. More than you would want to explain !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CRM13
50,Brilliant but get there early,"Exceptional collection of contemporary art. If you would like to view the ""infinity mirrored room"" installation, get there early and join the waiting list before taking the escalator up to the main area of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nNnNnNNnNNnNNNNNNNq
50,Wonderful experience,The museum exhibition is the extract of the modern art. Do not hurry and do not miss William Kentridge 2nd hand reading. The building itself is architecture gem and worth visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DamirS203
10,BE AWARE; INFINITI ROOM,"Don’t go to the BROAD even on a Tuesday and expect to see the Infiniti room - once you enter the museum, then you can put your name in - we went on a tuesday at 1:30 (it opens at 11 or 11:30 and all slots were gone - could not see it. Terribly disappointing. Seems like a way to get guests to spend the whole day waiting and hoping there will be a cancelation. Nothing on the website that made me expect anything like that. Apparently people line up 30 min before the museum opens in order to be the first in to secure a spot. BEWARE!!!!!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniellee_11
40,Buy tickets in advance. Expensive visit,"We avoided long lines by going through a somewhat cumbersome online process. We were disappointed to discover that the exhibit we went to see required another payment, and that parking was $27! Also, we were running late for our timed entry (traffic getting there is appalling: 90 minutes to go across town after lunch!), but calls to the museum went to a recording that asked us to leave a message.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrsirin
50,This is now my favorite art gallery in Los Angeles,"I am not a big fan of very contemporary art. However, the combination of the art and the magnificent architecture is magnetic. I loved the place. In this setting the work by Jeff Koons, and Andy Warhol stood out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MkMD11
50,Remarkable artistic experience,"I'm not into contemporary art myself, but Broad is next level artistic, warm, true cultural center. I liked the Pop art of the 1960s and the collections and works by Roy Lichtenstein, Ed Ruscha, and Andy Warhol, but truly enjoyed the 1980s especially Keith Haring works. The highlight of the visit to me was the infinity mirrored room. Although the time inside was limited at 45 seconds, you got the feeling of being alone with millions of stars, quite exquisite. I would recommend it to every true art lover. Make your visit flawless by making sure you have a time reservation before you get there, both for the main entrance but also for the infinity mirrored room",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peseva
50,Entertaining,"Pre-booking your tickets will save you a lot of pain on entry, and we were glad we did. The staff were friendly and professional and there are some exhibits of the very highest caliber when it comes to modern art from masters like Warhol and Koons. Downtown LA is starting to get its vibe and The Broad is a. If part of this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mrbasman74
30,Fun museum for modern art lovers,"This is a fun museum to visit, but mostly for modern art fans. It's interesting architecture is a plus. The main exhibit is on the top floor only. Definitely a modern art experience. You can pay $20 extra to visit a small exhibit of more modern art on the main floor if so inclined. The infinity room was cool but about the size of a closet. Only two people at a time can go into the room. It took about 2 hours after signing up to see this one little room.Waiting seems to be the main theme at this museum. I cannot really recommend this museum except to modern art enthusiasts.Also, just too much waiting for such a small exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jefflv999
50,ONE word - AWESOME!,I went with my family. My brother lives in LA and comes here a lot. I can only say this place is TOTALLY amazing and always changing so never bored. I will say the gift shop is quite expensive. I would buy something if it was more reasonable but the experiences you have can not be beat!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/triptikon
50,Very interesting,We caught an Uber there and walked straight in. Very interesting. Very good layouts and some excellent photo ops. A nice way to spend an hour.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterm608
50,Great Free Museum in Los Angeles,"I visited The Broad on my last vacation to Los Angeles, and it did not disappoint.It is a great contemporary art museum that is free to the public. So I highly recommend that you make an online reservation to visit as this will cut your time in the queue to get in.When I visited in February 2020, I was able to see artwork from Mark Bradford, Christopher Wool, Andy Warhol, and more. I was also able to see a series of films, one being from Shirin Neshat. The film was interesting and it really caught my attention.Another great addition to the museum is the Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrored Rooms. It was really amazing, but be ready to wait to get in. You have to checkin to get in the room and you are sent a text of when it's your turn. I do reccomend you occasionally check with staff at the entrance of the room to check on your wait time. Also, due to the long line of people the time you get to spend in the room is limited to a few seconds so have the camera ready!A parking garage is available for visitors, and you can get a validated ticket from museum staff for a discount on parking. I believe I paid $17 for three hours.Overall it was a great visit, and I would definitely go again for new exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/75FA
50,impressive showcase,"The Broad is that rare modern art museum where the design has been conceived to showcase the art rather than the architect’s ego. The bright, airy interior is a work of art in itself, rising from an expansive ground floor through a wonderfully tubular escalator into a free-admission main gallery of carefully curated masterworks. Signature kitschy sculpture by Jeff Koons (including his balloon dogs and porcelain Michael Jacksons) are given their own room, adjoining work by Ellsworth Kelly, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and other masters. The main attraction is a mirrored “infinity room” by Yayoi Kusama, a light show viewed through portholes that’s the sober equivalent of an LSD trip. The ground floor is given over to rotating exhibits of first-class provenance, most recently (Winter/Spring 2019/2020) a first-ever career retrospective of exiled Iranian artist Shirin Neshat. Always worth a look.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirkE266
50,Superb contemporary art,"This beautiful Museum in the Heart of Los Angeles, exceeded our expectations. The exhibits were beautifully displayed with knowledgeable docents to guide you through the museum and give you background and context. Parking was easy and you could spend many hours here touring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradinmn
50,Great museum,"Book ahead and visit! The museum website is an excellent introduction to the building and the collections at the Broad. The museum is friendly and welcoming. Its collections are very impressive. We loved the wildly ranging sculpture works from Jeff Koons, especially the Buster Keaton statue, but also the massive prints on display. While there are many pieces of interest in the museum, the ones by Mark Bradford grabbed most of our attention. The pieces are complex and multi-layered. The enormous ""Deep Blue"" of mixed media on canvas depicts the tragedy and devastation in Watts. See them all from a distance and examine them up close. They are remarkable works of art. The building itself is striking and inviting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/waterandmore
50,Truly Fabulous,"The Broad experience is truly fabulous in many ways.Booking – you can either book online in advance or if you can drop in and join the queue – I suggest booking. The museum is easy to reach, parking is equally easy. Staff are very friendly, efficient and the facilities are spotless. Inside, “traffic” is managed very well, there is no overcrowding in spaces. The museum website is remarkably informative, even giving current wait time with no reservation. The website also features times for Free Public Tours, which we sadly did not have enough time to take advantage of.The architecture is remarkable both inside and out, equal to the magnificent art housed within. I especially like the natural light and the way the space and light work beautifully with the works. I am in awe of the collection and curatorial skill. It feels like there is a respect and love for the work.Depending on your budget, you can enjoy the wonderful permanent collection gratis or you pay to see the temporary exhibits.The only thing that would have made our visit even more fabulous would be a tea or coffee shop on the premises, as those in close proximity were not the best. I look forward to our next visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChromeCorgi
50,Very Impressed,We traveled to LA last month and visited the Broad. My family and I were very pleased. Tickets are free to most of the gallery and the exhibits are beautiful. It’s is a kid friendly museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManuelC4942
50,Lovely museum,We were able to gets ticket by visiting the website and selecting the date and time you would like to visit. It was a plus we got tickets as we visited on the weekday rather than the weekend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jhm4317
50,A Must See!,"My friends and I visited this awesome museum. Great architecture, unique art displays, very aesthetic .... just some of the features of this museum. What truly enriched our experience was the smart, knowledgeable, enthusiastic staff, who were ready to share their knowledge about the art work or the artists. I could have spent the whole day there, although its not a large facility. Thanks to the Broads for this admission free facility and the opportunity to see and appreciate contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkkCalifornia
30,Simple,I was excited to come here as I have heard great things. There are some great art pieces here including the famous big chair/table set. It is free and you can go without tickets. I thought it was just okay. My favorite part was the Mirrored room. Very cool but very quick which is understandable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dayzers_
50,Modern and contemporary art,"The place is a wonderful mix of great architecture, modern art exhibitions, american art and great picture opportunities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielmicu

40,Interesting Modern Art Museum with Free Admission,"Interesting collection of modern art. You can spend a pleasant hour or so in here. Best of all is the free general admission. However to avoid standing in a long line, order your tickets in advance on their website and you can select a specific time to enter. Make sure you get your parking ticket validated before returning to the adjoining garage.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelingSoccerLoon
50,Great Evening and Free,We signed up for the free tickets to the third floor galleries. We spent over an hour enjoying artworks by different artists.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weimerunnr
50,Cool,What a great way to spend a couple of hours enjoying great artwork and displays. Make sure you get tickets first. They are free. Also then grab a cool dinner somewhere downtown. Enjoy a great family day out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allnines1414
50,Outstanding,"It is exactly the case when something exceptional is offered free of charge. The collection is unique and outstanding: Murakami, Warhol, Ruscha, you name it. To avoid the queue which is whimsically long irrespective of day of week, book a spot online. It is absolutely free: you just need to arrive by the chosen time. The Broad is located right across the street from the Walt Disney Concert Hall, so it is possible to see both attractions in one day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Elle_Ventrouge
50,"If you like Modern Art, this is for you!","I visited the Broad on New Year's Day. I was advised before leaving for my trip to CA to get tickets on-line. Since Wednesdays are free, I still got an advance reservation time and this saved me from waiting in a very long line for those without advance reservations. Once inside, there are numerous galleries devoted to the ""giants"" of American Modern Art, including Warhol, Koons, Jasper Johns & Basquiat. A special work of Yayoi Kusama is on display and you need to sign up ahead of time to get a viewing slot as only a few can be admitted at any given time.Worth the extra hassle!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/317KathyM
50,Shirin Neshat Retrospective,"Since studying moving image at University I've been a big fan of Shirin Neshat's video and photographic work. Getting to see it in situ in the beautifully curated retrospective at The Broad was inspirational and humbling.The gallery itself is home to a brilliant permenant collection with works by Andy Warhol, Barbara Kruger and Jeff Koons.It is free entry but the queue is enormous - I went on a weekday and it still reached the whole way round the building. Highly reccomend buying a ticket in advance for whatever special exhibition is on like I did. This means you can skip straight to the front and go right in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BebeDrew
50,Some of the most valuable art in the world for free,"The collection is outstanding. The architecture is unique. The size is just right. It's free. This museum if perfect for people who are obsessed with contemporary art (like me) and for people who are casually interested. I took a friend who is not particularly enthusiastic about art, and she said it was fantastic.I did not have a reservation, but arrived around 10:30 am on New Year's Day and got into the museum around 11:15 am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeyImaginary
20,"Nice art, but nasty service and not wheelchair friendly","We were in LA for a few days and signed up for a 12:30pm entrance to the Broad. As we had recently seen Love is Calling in at the ICA in Boston, we wanted to see Kusama's Infinity Room at the Broad. They have a really terrible process - first you have to get a ticket for an entry time to the museum, then go to an ipad area to sign up for the infinity room. We had one person in a wheelchair who was pushed aside in line by the customer service person. Once we finally entered, it was at least a 2 hour wait for the Infinity Room with a long line at the ipad so we spent most of our time in line. The person in charge of the ipad was very unfriendly.In addition, the ""accessible"" bathroom was not really wheelchair friendly and required 2 people to help hold the door to the stall. The Broad should take a lesson from the ICA in Boston - give an entry time to the exhibit online. At the ICA, it was very smooth with little wasted time in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbf59
50,Stunning art in stunning construct,"It was a unique opportunity to admire the greatest modern and contemporary art works. Such a tremendous range of artists are presented with some of their best pieces on view.Mark Tansey is well represented with great creations. We spent time in front of his intriguing Achilles and the Tortoise. It symbolises the hectic pace of technological advances versus the slower growth of nature exemplified by a fine pine tree. Amongst famous figures, it shows Princess Diana planting a tree and Albert Einstein in the midst of an observing group.Jeff Koons's Jim Beam - J.B. Turner Train is marvellous. In stainless steel and bourbon, it refers to the famous bourbon marketing whereby bottles sold had a toy piece of their transport train. If enough of the whiskey was bought the whole train could be yours.Another highlight was Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Room with its infinity of stars.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
40,Great exhibit for art lovers and non art lovers,I wish I had more time to spend here but we got last minute tickets on a very busy holiday weekend. It was a short walk from the Biltmore (our hotel). I forgot to reserve tickets for free general admission and we almost did not go. When arrived the line looked like 100 people deep two hours to close. But we found out that was the free ticket stand by line. We paid for the $10 tickets and walked right in. We were sad we were to late for infinity room reservations. But there is a line for the mini infinity exhibit inside. A must do!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wanderlust32772
50,Inspiring,Great looking building and also the art on display was very worth the visit. Especially as it was free! A must do if you're in downtown.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TPAT75
50,Wonderful,A beautiful space inside and out. Exhibits rotate with some permanent items. Enjoyed Mark Bradford pieces immensely. Shirin Nashat photos were very interesting and worth the $20 ticket for this special exhibit. We are lucky to have this museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/busyflying
50,Awesome!,"We visited the museum and we really enjoyed it. The best part? It was free! If you are in downtown LA, you need to go. We went around 5:30 pm and waited in line about 30 minutes. It was worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoanV116
50,Fascinating Art Museum,"We spent just under two hours at The Broad and needed more time to do it justice. The ""guard"" in one room took the time to familiarize us with the works of Mark Tansey, which was very helpful. Definitely recommend this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RioVistaPatty
50,Great design,"The Broad in downtown LA looks like a cheese grater design on the outside but the green mole hills on the pavement are something, weird but a great design.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TeamWard

50,Love Boutique Museum,We love visiting here. The Broad Collection is so worthwhile as is the building. This museum is a ton of fun for our family and we loved that we got into the Kusama Infinity Room as well as to see into the other Kusama piece that is on site right now. Beautiful building too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thegoodegg
30,"Fantastic building, so-so art",Title says it all. Go just to see the fantastic building. The art has some interesting stuff but little that I'd consider museum-quality. Maybe it's just me - other people seemed to like it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JetDesigner
50,"Eli & Edythe Broad giving, giving, giving",Why do people look at me funny when I tell them how magical downtown Los Angeles is? I'm just going through and looking at ALL the good things my friends in this city have put together and it gets overwhelming.

40,Don’t forget to queue for the Infinity Room,A wonderful collection of Lichtensteins. And don’t miss Yayoi Kusama’s infinity room on the ground floor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dissolvedgirl
50,Good collection of modern and contemporary art,We came here specifically for the Infinity Room and were glad we arrived about 30 minutes prior to the doors opening as the line for that (timed) exhibit were very long later in the morning. It was our first visit to The Broad and I was very pleased with the art on exhibit. A good mix of 20th Century art and contemporary art as well as some huge installations. The exhibition halls are very large and airy so you don't feel crowded while viewing the art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jerjon
50,Art ❤,This has been on my list to get to and I finally made it. My first time here. Admission is free. Enjoyed the museum. My absolute favorite was the infinity mirror room by Yayoi Kusama. Altho you only get 45secs it's worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mdizX

50,free modern art,"my free DT LA walking tour ended up here. if you make an online reservation, you can skip the line at the entrance.it's a beautiful building inside and outside as well. next to Disney Concert Hall in center LA, near a Red Line Metro station.nice place if you are into modern art. the upper floor had the most outstanding exhibits: the infinity mirror, the big table, balloon shapes made out of metal, etc. spent more than an hour inside. really good for photos.good for all ages !! would recommend :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacqquel
30,Hard to complain about something free,"I have mixed feelings about The Broad because it is, after all, a free exhibit so I don't feel right about speaking down about it. If you have an avid appreciation for art, you'll probably love it. If you're a bit more on the curious side, you might feel like it's time that could have been better spent elsewhere. While the majority of the museum itself is free, there are sections that are partitioned off from the rest that are not. In addition to that, parking is not included and I couldn't find where to validate it despite reading that you could. I won't go on too much about that though since the majority of this was free, so I consider it to be the price of the museum, but it's something I think visitors need to know and should consider. We initially came because of the ""Infinity Room"" exhibit that was advertised as part of The Broad. The unfortunate part about that is that pretty much no matter how early you arrive there's going to be a long wait and it's going to be a lot longer than it'll take you to get through the museum. So you're left with the choice of standing around until you're called or bailing early. The plus side is that the ""general public"" art is all pretty interesting, but some of it misses the mark in my eyes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RSzklarz
50,Glamorous Modern Art Museum for all Ages!,"We made quick online reservations the day before we wanted to go to The Broad.You can easily make these online and I would highly recommend it! We skipped the line and were able to go right inside.We walked in and immediately went into the Infinity Mirror Exhibit Kiosk to get our name on the list. I would recommend doing this when you first enter. Then you can go about your time walking around the museum until you get a text to head down for your slot. If enter the museum close to 4-5pm you have an hour where you can go to some exhibits that you would normally need to pay for. This created a better bang for our buck.Upstairs has so many great exhibits. It was so much fun to walk around. Art that incorporates size, perspective, colors, etc. It would be great for kids. We spent about 90 minutes here.Very much worth it and it was a fun museum when some might museums not be for all ages.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Wheres_Kimbo
50,Great Free Contemporary/Modern Art Museum,This museum is a must visit attraction in downtown LA. It is located next the the Kodak Theatre and Across the street from the MOCA. Admission is free and advance reservations can be made in their website. You can try and walk-in without a Rez but might have a long wait. Visitor educational headphones are available for a $6 fee which would probably help with explanation some of the more unusual pieces. Special attraction exhibits might require advance Rez and a fee. The structure is amazing the the exhibits are unique and entertaining for all ages.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/johnjN8052KK
50,Gorgeous modern art museum,"We visited The Broad after a local friend strongly suggested we check it out while we were visiting. The lines for free general entry were wrapped around the building and the wait was between 1 1/2 - 2 hrs for entry. We opted to buy tickets (because supporting the Arts is cool) which gains you immediate access in regardless of the lines. Once inside we checked out the featured exhibit and then went upstairs to check out the main showroom. The art pieces features a wonderful mix of contemporary artists - Basquiat, Yayoi Kusama and Warhol to name a few. An all around wonderful experience in a beautiful building inside and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/niavm2017
50,Evening visit,Really diverse collection of contemporary work...with no charge! We were pleased to see so many young people interacting with the works. Nice staff. Give yourself a couple hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CSSnowshoer
50,Fascinating contemporary art displayed in a fabulous modern gallery.,"The Broad is a contemporary art museum that opened in September 2015 in downtown Los Angeles. General admission to its permanent collection galleries is free and I highly recommend a few hours taking in the fabulous artwork displayed in this amazing architectural building. As with any museum or gallery there will always be exhibits that don't interest you but in general I found the collections at The Broad simply fascinating. The huge blue Balloon Dog and Tulips by Jeff Koons are great fun; the work of Andy Warhol's and the Comic Book style art of Roy Lichtenstein is simply iconic; and Robert Therrien's ""Under the Table"" makes you feel like an extra from 'Honey I Shrunk The Kids'. There is also great book / gift shop which is perfect for gifts for any art lover or art student. There is a large car park opposite the gallery but prices to park are not cheap. In summary I really enjoyed my couple of hours in The Broad and when entrance is free you don't get much better value for money than that!! The Broad therefore comes Highly Recommended by me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Roberts69
50,pleasently surprised!,"In this trip we were not even trying to come downtown, but when we saw there was a piece by Yayoi Kusama, we decided to stop by.I´m so glad we did, the museum is impeccable and all the pieces they had on display were great. It is something super fun to do if you are in the area and the best thing is that is free. Do try to reserve your spot online and skip the line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cyngtz

50,Broad and Modern,"Loved Mark Bradford' Deep Blue wall. You can find Koons, Litchenstein, Basquiat, Kara Walker, Ligon, and Warhol here (to name a few). Amazing architecture in the heart of downtown area. Interesting to see the art storage area too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bijoux123
50,One of the Best,"A small museum that really packs a punch. Their collection is incredible. In addition it is free of charge. I was there for a traveling installation, ""the infinity mirrors"", that was amazing in itself, but even without that the museum is recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caramello51
50,An Excellent Museum to See if You are in the LA Area,Oustanding museum. A lot of exhibits to see. They have packed a lot into this place. Definately worth the trip to visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Briman747
50,Terrific museum with some really remarkable pieces,Pop art with some incredible pieces on display. They had several works from Basquiat and from Koons that I had never seen before. Smaller than I thought it would be but a great experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bmanpennsylvania
50,Treasure of contemporary art in downtown LA,"This was my second visit to the Broad; my first visit was 2 years ago, on my own, for the Kusama exhibit and it blew my mind! This visit was no different; however, this time, I was with friends. What makes the Broad special is 3 fold: the building, the work inside the building and the staff that work there. The Broad is a white striking “honeycombed” facade encasing the inner building which, in turn, encases the inner core, the storage area for the Broad’s extensive collection. You can see the building as you approach it, that and the neighbouring Disney Concert Hall are hard to miss. The work on display is astounding, ranging from Warhol to Koons, Tansy, Rauschenberg, Twombly, Lichtenstein, etc... too many to list. The highlight of the visit was the r of Basquiats. Finally, our docent was outstanding - knowledgeable, passionate, engaging, thoughtful and inclusive. The experience was joyful, profound, thought provoking and insightful. Highly recommended if you enjoy art in any form.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vansancopp
40,Go in see art and stuff,So yeah go to this place see some art be cultured I guess. I saw the lights in a room that was cool. Saw an oversized table and chairs that were cool. Saw wood laying around thought it was art it was construction. Real classy place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Standupman28
50,A must,"The distribution is great and they have a great collection of modern art. My only complaint is that after having to book your time slot to see the lights exhibition, you're only given 45 seconds inside. An entire minute wouldn't hurt and the queue would still be pretty dynamic. I wish the gift shop were a bit more varied too. However, sticking to the art and the building, it's great. And it's free, so it's a must.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoldenJoplin
50,Brilliant Musuem,"We visited the Broad as no visit to LA is complete until you visit here. Do not rush, spend your time walking around at a very gentle pace and take it all in. The special exhibits they run here are tremendous and worth paying for.The audio guides are not that good and sometimes go on for a while longer than they need to but if you want some in depth detail of the pictures, photographs or sculpture then its worth the $6Book the tickets well in advance so you can beat the queue as it gets really long very quickly and, with a prebooked ticket you can go to the front, check your bags in and enjoy the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iwanderaroundtown
50,Must See!,"Best thing about this is that 3rd floor and special Infinity Room exhibition were completely free when I went. It’s a quick stop, maybe for an hour or two if you plan to stop and look at everything, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dominiquecollucci
50,Simply fabulous,"Totally enjoyed this gallery visit. As with most galleries there were art works I loved, art works I hated and some I just didn't understand but that, to me, is 5he best bit; never quite knowing what might be around the next corner! Thd construction of the actual building is art in itself . The staff there were very helpful.Definitely one to visit in LA",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jude1960_G
10,Worst experience in my 9 day california trip,"One employee at this museum had made a comment to my girlfriend that was more than appalling, and management didn't seem to care. I and my girlfriend visited the broad mid October 2018 in 9 day trip thru California. We visited Los Angeles, did the normal tourist stuff along with visiting here. I have never been in a place that has gender neutral bathrooms and didn't quite understand which one I needed to use. My girlfriend located a museum employee to enquire which restroom I should use. The employee told her I should use the gender neutral restroom. My girlfriend had made a simple remark after that which was not derogatory, did not discriminate or even insult the employee. Her remark was ""Oh, sorry I'm not use to that because I'm from Texas"". The employee responded with ""Oh, okay. Well you can get the f**k out then!"" Then she just marched away. We were both quite upset by the remark, but handled it with decency and composure. We went upstairs, spoke with another employee, and explained what had just happened. The employee brought it to a managers attention. The manager apologized for the incident, but the apology lacked any sympathy at all. Almost as if the manager did not care.We visited santa Barbara, san Francisco, long beach, disney land, sequoia and kings canyon national parks and Los Angeles. The entire trip was excellent with the exception of visiting The Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/655russelln
30,Beware the parking garage,"Knocked two stars for that. Garage charges $25 (!!) - $15 if you get your ticket validated, but no clear sign to tell you that and the museum doesn't bother to explain it at all. If you pay first before trudging back to the meseum you are SOL, no refund. Really ticked me off. Makes this very expensive indeed and while the building itself is impressive and the collection interesting that leaves a very bad taste. That said, if you're a modern art fan, there's a lot here, and fortunately not too much of the Malevich style stuff. In other words, the artists on exhibit had something to say. Infinity room - overrated - meh. The idea has been done. Special exhibit Shirin Neshat genuinely interesting - some of it too personal perhaps to reach a broad (non-Islamic) audience, but others so introspective you need to stop and contemplate.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottrA3361XW
50,Incredible collection - spectacular architecture,"Wow! Loved this collection. Truly a remarkable gathering of some of the best modern artists in America IMHO. Yet, it’s easily processed - and it’s so accessible at the Broad. All the classics of Modern Art.The building itself is quite impressive with its playful interpretations of light.Only spent a little over an hour here - but will be visiting again. The interactive exhibit is very difficult to get into - you cannot buy tix on line, and tix are gone by mid morning. If you’re traveling to the museum it’s unlikely you’ll get to see it. Major bummer. But will keep trying. There is plenty to take in without this however - so don’t be deterred.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Canafornian
40,Interesting Museum,"Went there without really planning it, it happened to be free entrance and I spent a good quality hour wandering around the art pieces. I tried to access the infinity gallery but the wait was 2h for 45sec inside, so I cannot really say anything about temporary exposition and infinite glass piece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dario540
50,Great museum,"This was a fun way to spend a couple of hours in LA. The art was interesting and we enjoyed it as a family (there was only one exhibit room that was inappropriate for kids, which had a sign letting you know.) Definitely sign up for the infinity room on the kiosk in the lobby - it was full by the time we arrived at 1pm. The museum is free, but you have to book your spot online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/akboeckman
50,Best museum experience ever!,"Fantastic exhibition. Best ever. And I have seen Basquiat in Paris, been to palais de Tokyo, Berlin modern museum of art, Louisiana etc etc. Magnificently joyful",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrsMZH
50,a day in LA,"First stop to start the day, and be early and on time, the downtown Grand Central. If you arrive when you should, 7am parking shouldn't be bad, the wait for an array of choices for your much needed breakfast is kind. My choice will always be a breakfast sammy from EggSlut. After your quick power scarf your ready to go burn some cals.From downtown your in friendly distance to the Hollywood sign hike. Grab a water, chewybar and sunscreen.There's a tourist way and there's the right way. And that's the Wisdom Tree to Hollywood Sign trail. Now that you've earned it, head back downtown where you should have a room booked nearby to the Broad Museum. Jump in the pool and give yourself some time to relax.Now that your charged a bit get dressed and time for some arts. Make sure you made online reservations for The Broad and you'll be coasting into a very-very cool viewing experience. After your viewing pleasure grab dinner or drinks. You're now perfectly situated within easy walking distance to plenty of dine or drink options.Pro Tip: Take a quick Uber over to one of the many culinary creations in the Arts District.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buoyed
50,Short worthwhile visit,Free and very welcomeShould book in advance in order to enterGreat architecture with modern artGood toilets,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_S6941BL
50,Nice Museum!,"We visited in August 2018, but TripAdvisor doesn’t let me go that far! If you’re interested in the arts or architecture, it’s definitely worth a visit. They have so many fantastic artworks and their traveling or rotating exhibitions were also really good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElleeBokharachi
40,infinity mirror room - one of its kind,I specially went for infinity light room and it was worth waiting for 2 hours. you are allowed only 45 seconds inside room but still i would say its worth going to see infinity mirror room. there are other creative things but I went there for mirror room and it was worth.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/817jordanj
50,Wish I had more time,"If you don't like avant garde or modern art, this may not be your thing, as it wasn't for a few people in our party. I wish I would have had more time without them to enjoy the amazing artwork. Once we got our turn in the infinity room, they were ready to leave which disappointed me. If you want to see the greatest artwork turned out in the last 50 years, this is the museum to visit. Some will gripe about the selfie culture inside, but times change. You either evolve or die. At least these kids are at a museum. I wish the gift shop had slightly more Broad-branded clothing, but it's a minor thing. You only get 45 seconds in the infinity room, so have your camera, or video camera ready. I will return here, by myself, another day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ewamaine
30,Disappointing,Mix and match of permanent exhibits . Long wait an hour for infinity mirrored room! Most permanent works like basquat has been seen,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Margeritta
50,Cool even for teens!,"Loved it here - free and has great art, including infinity mirrors. Just make sure to get free tickets online for early in the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P4086IJpault
50,Best art museum outing for all in LA,I love this museum and I love seeing so may people looking at art and enjoying all that is has to offer. This museum is smart you can ask any staff member about anything on the walls ... how cool is that!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taylor_NDiaye
50,Great art!,"We went on a tuesday which wasnt crowded and we booked tickets online. Great atmosphere, very clean, very simple. We finished our visit in about an hour so it was a quick run thru. Recommended if you are in LA for a short time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YouNeedADentist
50,Beyond expectation as a free museum,It’s not a typical art museum. Very easy to understand with guided tour. The design and decoration created a good ambiance. Ensure to book online before you go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/candypp
50,unique outside with many great exhibits inside,this is one of the great new art venues in all of LA and it's free. you do have to plan ahead to get the free tickets which sometimes is a challenge. or buy them on craig's list for $5 to $10 if you have last minute guests in town or need to go the next day. the special exhibits inside can also be a challenge and require wait times of more than an hour. as soon as you arrive put your name in for the special exhibit to help with timing. we were able to leave and grab lunch next door before being called. this is really worth a visit but as I said earlier you must plan ahead.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JackV846
50,Still impressive after 3-1/2 years since first visit,"The Broad is a very interesting experience and has some very important pieces of contemporary art. Some are the same as those from my first visit, but they are timeless in their importance and appeal. There is a great collection of Andy Warhol and the Rabbit by Jeff Koons is just a blast. The other works are provocative and timely. Entertaining and also educational and thought-provoking. The staff is very friendly and helpful and really add to the experience. Best of all, it's free. You can get in a line to wait for an opening, but it is very easy to book ahead of time online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,Not as impressed on my return visit.,"Note that there were significantly fewer visitors than two years ago, which of course may be because it is not during the popular tourist season.Some new works of art have been put in place, perhaps not as spectacular. But as an art visit for the common man it is a memorable visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
50,Not to be missed!,Come to see this facinating building ... composed of “the veil” and “the vault”. It is perfectly suited to house the spectacular collection of modern art. Many of the pieces are super large and make a powerful impression. There is no entrance fee. We really enjoyed the free tour of the museum! Look forward to coming back some day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142local
50,Free of charge!,"The Broad is a free museum in downtown Los Angeles, California with an impressive collection of contemporary art. Book tickets online and in advance to guarantee entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielcT3983ND
50,Great Museum by the Music Center,"This is a very good museum of modern art. The entry is free, but reservations are highly recommended way in advance ( online). You can try and get in without reservations and stay out in long lines. You need to pay for special exhibits, which are usually very good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tirzahaviv
20,Just a so-so experience,"It's one fairly large floor of almost-all-large works. Does modern and contemporary art not contain small works? I would hate to see how small works would be displayed in this space. It's all big names: Basquiat, Koons, Twombly, Bradford, Johns, Warhol. Mostly 3-6 works by each artist, one artist per room. Absolutely no indication of how they fit into the artistic tradition and very little indication of their significance. The Broad is nothing compared to the German museums of contemporary art, and less than nothing compared with the Tate Modern. It's nice to see some of the stuff, and in particular how the many children reacted to the works. I like the Twombly room best, but again, even here it's nothing compared to the Brandhorst in Munich. It's a guy showing off the stuff he bought because he could. I was ready to leave in about 45 minutes. A disappointment.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/opera_fanatic47
50,Stunning experience,"Nice building, fantastic exhibitions in Broad. It cannot be described, it must be experienced. We ordered tickets online and came early before opening. Just make sure you start with Kusama artworks as his work attracts biggest crowds. We are not modern art buffs, but still found The Broad exhibitions really cool. Would come again if we are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Thomasero
40,Open floor plan gives space to see the art,"Large art needs space for viewing, and this museum allows room to stand back to view and well as get up close. The building itself is visually interesting, and the windows into the storage rooms over a glimpse into a museum one rarely gets. Call ahead to reserve tickets for time of entry, to avoid standing in long lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VacationRoaming
30,Some parts are interesting,"Arrived at 12:40pm on a Wednesday. Even though our tickets were for 1pm, there was not a large crowd, so we could get in early. Could not sign up for the Infinity Mirror exhibit initially, so we went to the 3rd floor main gallery. Nice long escalator ride.There were some exhibits that my 8 year old liked: the balloon sculptures, the oversized table, and another piece similar to the infinity mirror display on the first floor. I liked seeing the Andy Warhol soup cans.However, since most of the museum is contemporary art, it was hard to explain to my son the meaning that the artist was trying to convey in a lot of exhibits.I like the mobile app to help explain who the artist is, and a more detailed description of the art.Went back to the first floor to see if we could get into the infinity mirror room. We were able to get a reservation for an hour later. The room is actually quite small, and we only had 45 seconds to experience it.The architecture of the exterior of the museum is very interesting, given that it is right next to the Disney concert hall, and amidst various office buildings.Since I am a person not familiar with contemporary art, it was nice to learn about it. But the Broad doesn't have enough pieces for young children, and you cannot touch anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GiantsFanLosAngeles
50,Really nice artworks,"My bf and I, we've been to LACMA and then to The Broad and we both agreed that The Broad is more interesting and the pieces from there are more touchy and speak more to the non-artists.Very nice artworks and vision.We also booked audio-guides for 6$ each - totally worth it as it gives more information about the artists and their style/vision/culture etc.Definitely a MUST go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dekadenza
50,A Highlight of Los Angeles,The Broad Museum is a must see when in Los Angeles. It is located right across from Disney Hall and a short walking distance from the Muselum of Contemporary Art (MOCA). The architecture is stunning and features great artwork.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Herb_Silverman
40,Very nice and cool museum of contempory art,A must in LA and great objects on exhibition. It is opposite of Moca and if you go there you must visit the futuristic building and grat exhibition,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OKBN12345
50,Broad delivers big time!,"I am so happy that I got to visit The Broad. If you are a museum lover and in LA it is a must see. Even for those who are casual art lovers, it delivers amazing work that anyone would enjoy. The exhibits were thought provoking and just plain, cool as sh$t. Basquiat, Warhol, Walker, Kusama, Johns are just a few of the amazing artist who's work The Broad features. Next time I am in LA I will definitely go back again. I enjoyed it more that LACMA.Best of all The Broad is free. Go online and get your time ticket in advance. Then walk in and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquell411
50,A must see when in LA.,"It depends on your interest but for modern contemporary art, it is excellent. Remember to book your spot online.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gina19900907
40,You Have to Go,You have to go if only to say you've been!The Architecture is amazing and what they've done inside and out is impressive.The collection is unique and a crowd pleaser. It's one floor (for the most part) of stuff you will be surprised to see. From Andy Warhol to Jeff Koons - wonderful!Make a reservation - no charge. Park close by or in the same building but check out the prices before you park.Lots of stuff around - so give yourself time to walk around the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/evdepaz
50,Amazing!,This is a fabulous gallery. The online instructions to book were easily followed. I unfortunately missed there being any special exhibitions so I would definitely go again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/60emilyr
30,Guess we just aren't that into modern art,"The Broad is a beautiful building and free entry is fantastic. However, we are not big fans of the art so the visit was not all that interesting for us. Those who appreciate modern art more will likely enjoy it. We just kept looking at each other and say ""How is that considered art?"" I guess art is different for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LUCKYME72
40,Interesting but not outstanding. Fun place to spend an hour!,"The museum locates in a good area. There are many interesting and representative pieces. It is small but you can spend a solid happy hour admiring art pieces there!I do wish there were more descriptions of the art pieces and/or the artists. Many paintings just had names. Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is a good example of putting up descriptions. Whether its the artists philosophy, the admires' feelings and poems...something to help the visitors read, admire, think, and appreciate this collection more. Otherwise for an amateur, its a very shallow experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AuroraL865
30,"free entry, nice interesting pieces, long waiting time for infinity room","I´m not such a fan of art, but since the entry is free there was nothing to lose. There are definitely interesting pieces, just don´t forget to book thicket online to avoid standing in the line. And for an infinity room, there´s another wait list where you have to sign up at the entry, so make sure to do it as a first thing before wandering around the museum - waiting time was 1 - 2 hours! So we decided to skip that.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Daduci
30,Overrated and Poor Visitor Experience,"We booked online so didn't have to join the long outside queue in the sweltering heat.Booking online is free and I would recommend if you do decide to visit.The exhibits are interesting to see and you will get some good photographs if you want for your Instagram account.The gallery staff are really very poor. The interaction with guests - not just my party - was in general rude and indifferent. The contrast to the Walt Disney Concert Hall (next door, free and well worth a visit) could not have been more striking. The staff at the Concert Hall were courteous, polite and engaging.The staff at The Broad (in general as I am sure there are some great team members) appeared disinterested and in general rude.As you walk to some exhibits a team member with a stopwatch will advise you have 45 seconds to look at. Fair enough if this is how they operate, but there are ways and means of advising this to guests. From our standpoint it was over officious and for want of a better word rude. The staff appeared to enjoy raising their voices to advise guests not to get too near exhibits. Again no problem with this, but ways and means!This was the general viewpoint from all my party who wandered around the gallery in different areas. I really think that team training (and it comes down to poor management not just the individuals themselves) and weeding out those who generally don't want to work there would improve the guest experience.There are better places to visit in LA and if your time is limited I would not recommend The Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DJLGB
50,Outstanding Late Modern/Contemporary Collection and All for Free!,"The Broad has an outstanding collection of late modern/contemporary masters. This is a must visit when in the LA area. And to top it off, The Broad is free of charge. The collection is very strong in works by Jeff Koons, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Johns and Basquiat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hermuslj
50,Amazing facade and free of charge!,"I wish I had a chance to go inside. Unfortunately I only had a chance to see it from the outside (I came to late, after hours) but the faces of the building is very unique. I highly recommend to see it on its own if you don't have time to go inside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/O6378WFannag
40,Nice couple of hours of interesting art exhibit,We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was really crowded but luckily we got our tickets before hand or else we shall not be able to get in as there is a really long line. The exhibit were all modern arts and were very interesting. We wish they had more description beside each exhibit as some really do not have any description other than the artist's / donor info. We want to see the infinity room but they were fully booked and wished they have online booking for that. All in all a fun couple of hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522timothyl
50,Loved it,"Had a great time here. The art was modern and different than most stuffy museums. There was a special exhibit that there was a line for, but it moved quick and was worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigEvilBaby
50,Amazingly diverse collection of modern art,We go here every spring. It is truly hands down the most comprehensive collection on the west coast. Check online in advance to see what the special exhibit is. But main collections rotate regularly so you wont be disappointed. May museums will have 4 or 5 of comparable works in display whereas The Broad will have hundreds. A must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannonontherun
50,"Free admission, great art, worth it!","We got there on Labor day Sunday and the free admission line was 45 mins long. We decided to go to the paid line which was still 15-20 mins. Highly recommend buying or reserving online first!If you can't it is a long and possibly very hot wait, then you can use the free umbrellas to shield yourself.Inside the main highlight for us was the mini infinity mirror display, the room exhibit was sold out already. There is about an hour of things to see and view. It is not as good as the Mori art museum of Tokyo but comes in at a top 3 for me. The Getty has more classical pieces while the MOCA and Broad are more contemporary.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JCtennis8
40,A free admission museum in the heart of Los Angeles,"If you come from oversea and want to spend some time in downtown Los Angeles, this should be on the top of your list.

50,An unusual collection of art and exhibitions.,"Centrally located in downtown L.A. the Broad is a specially built museum that houses the extensive modern art collection of its principal patrons, Eli and Edythe Broad. Best, news it is free to visit, but get a reservation early. And make sure you have enough time after visiting to enjoy the gardens on top of Disney Hall, the new public plaza at The Music Center, and most importantly the famed collection of art at the Museum of Contemporary Art, right across the street from the Broad. And excellent day's visit, plus take in one of the fine restaurants nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JayArr7
40,A nice little museum,"We were surprised to see the line for free admission wrap around the building 30 minutes before opening on a Sunday. We waited about 45 minutes to get in, and spent about equally long inside the museum. It is a very pleasant space with many interesting works. Don't expect to spend a whole day, or even a whole afternoon there. It was certainly worth visiting for free, but I would have left disappointed if I had paid for tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m35201
40,Great place to spend an hour while you're downtown.,Went for the Illusion exhibits. Didn't realize there was a time limit for the major one. It was pretty cool. Enjoyed the collection overall. I wouldn't make a special trip just to go here. Combine it with lunch at Otium or Grand Central Market.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Foodiemom15
40,Unique building with free admission,We decided to stop in but found we could not pre-book the free tickets so that meant standing in the stand by line. We tried twice and decide to wait the second time; you can ask how long the wait is. There are lots of iconic and photo worthy modern pieces. The museum is very popular and I think would be fun for teens/young adults too. It is medium sized so even with the special exhibit it did not take as long to visit as many of the other museums in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LSQRD1
50,Must visit when in LA!,"I had a 12 hr layover in LA recently, so I took and Uber from LAX to The Broad (helpful tip: it’s pronounced “Bro-d” like toad with a “B” not “Broad” like Broadway)The building alone is worth the trip! Such a cool design!Inside is filled with great art from Contemporary and Modern artist.So if you’re into Jeff Koons, Jenny Saville, Warhol.... you’ll be in heaven.The interior is just as cool as the exterior. You feel like you’re going thru a tunnel into space just going up the escalator!Another great thing about The Broad is location location location!It is next door to the Incredible Disney Concert Hall which is, I’m my opinion, THE coolest building in all of LA.... maybe even all of California!Hint: reserve your free tickets online as there is sometimes a long line to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ItalianOnTheGo
50,"Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Broad","Excellent collection of socially meaningful modern art. We reserved tickets beforehand and it worked very well. Of course driving to down to LA involved dealing with a bit of traffic. There were 5 of us, so the parking fee of $20 coupled with free admission made this visit a steal. Everyone of us found something that we really liked. Eli and Edith Broad gave this amazing gift to the City of Los Angeles to add to the already incredible art museum scene in Southern California. The visit took a bit over 3 hours, which included standing in line to see the caleidoscope installation twice for about 10 minutes each time. Photos without flash are allowed, and we have taken a few to be able to refresh our memories of the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vdshkolnikov
50,Amazing Gift,"That this is a free museum with such riches to offer is truly remarkable. I must thank the Broads for their vision, their phenomenal collection, the excellent well run institution they built. Was there when it first opened, and now, have visited again, and still terrific. Plan ahead though as getting tickets, which are timed, in advance means you don't have to queue up needlessly. Still have to check in and wait for the Infinity Room, but that, too, is seamless, just do it upon entry. Took a docent-led tour and that truly enhanced the experience. One of LA's gems.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney
40,Busy place plan accordingly,"We reserved some tickets beforehand - that's the way to go since the line was all the way around the building on a Tuesday afternoon. It was still pretty crowded inside and the museum staff was busy keeping people from touching exhibits, move their backpacks to the front, put your drinks and vape away...etc. It was a little chaotic to be able to enjoy the art. But I guess this being a ""instagrammable"" place that's not what people are there to do.I'd go at an off-peak time if you want to enjoy it better. Heck, if you're in it for Instagram you probably want that too so you can take the pictures without a whole crowd around it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmgE55
50,"Sunday Fun Day, Day After Birthday","When you have visitors in town The Broad is a nice place to introduce your visitors to LA. Free entry but parking can add up to $15-$20. The infinity room as I call it is super cool. The line to get in was 2 1/2 wait, just to spend 60 seconds to take pictures. 😂 we did not sit around for two hours at The Broad. We walked down to Grand Central Market walked around, have lunch, have ice cream take the Flight little train up, a one minute ride for $1 and boom it was our turn to get a chance to see the infinity room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JustAretha
50,Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Rooms a must see,"Beautiful artwork in a beautiful setting. The Infinity Mirror Rooms are a must see - esp the ""Infinity Mirrored Room—The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away"". Set up a free admission to the Broad ahead of time by booking online, or be prepared to wait a while in the standby line (thankfully mostly in the shade) for this most popular of LA sites to visit. Once inside, head straight to the iPad set up to book your separate 45 second sojoun in the Infinity Room. It's worth it to see this & the entire modern art collection!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keen1001
50,Book your free tickets online before your visit and skip the lines,"First up - it’s pronounced Brode not Broad, as we soon learnt from staff. Secondly, try to book your tickets online before your visit. If you can’t, you can still get in, its just a longer wait in the line. We got there just as it opened and with tickets waited about 5 minutes, but by the time we left the lines were really long so be preparedOnce you’re in, there’s just one floor of exhibits plus the ground floor (infinity room and gift shop). When you enter on the ground floor, go immediately to the left and queue for time slots to go into the infinity room. The staff will tell you what time slot you have so you’re free to check out the exhibits until its time to head back to enter the infinity room. If you have a US phone you’ll get a text message, otherwise just remember the time you have to be back at the infinity room line.The exhibits are great but unless you linger over every single piece it doesn’t take much time to see everything. We went through the entire floor within half an hour and then went back to see the infinity room (2 minute wait in our time slot).Overall would recommend if you don’t have to wait for long in the lines. Its a good way to spend a couple of hours seeing amazing art for free. Make sure you get a time slot for the infinity room once you enter the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emm3cee
50,Cool free little museum,"A super cool and medium sized museum in downtown. Entry is free, you just have to reserve tickets before you get there (we got ours that morning, so it didn’t appear to be in high demand for days before).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Moderngiraffe

40,Vacation,Soul of a Nation was profound. Added to my daughter’s knowledge of African American history.Despite smooth entrance to The Broad and the Soul of a Nation exhibit was unaware of the need to pre-sign up for the Yawoi Kusama “Infinity Mirrors” presentation. Left without seeing it. Would have liked to have known that as a tourist.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RoseR2471

50,Great experience and it's free!,"We hadn't booked ahead to visit the Broad,but decided to risk it and go and queue. We arrived about 50 minutes before it opened and there were about 6 people in front of us. The non reserved queue was in the shade thankfully and it was well worth the wait. We got let in as soon as it opened.What a fantastic building and what a brilliant exhibition. There was a lot of variety and something for everyone. My particular favourite was the big blue balloon dog by Jeff Koons.My only disappointment was the shop, everything was fantastically expensive and there was nothing to remember my visit with.That wouldn't put me off though, a great attraction if you are in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Simon682015
50,Interesting Museum,"Some of the more contemporary exhibits are similar to the Baltimore Museum of Art (which I love). I went with my five grandkids (6, 7, 9, 13, 16) and they were interested for about an hour. We stood in line on a weekday to get in, but it went fairly quickly, and they provided umbrellas for those standing in the sun. There's a small shaded next to the museum and an ice cream place. Looked like a good spot for a picnic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8fish2017
30,Bored of the Broad,Beware if you have kids. You may be in and out of the museum sooner than it takes to get there. So take some time to go out and explore and get something to eat near the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/805keitha

50,Amazing Museum,"Totally enjoyed this contemporary museum both for the architecture of the building and the exhibits. Lots of space to appreciate the art even on a busy day. It was easy to book tickets on their app. The cost to park with the free admission gave us time to walk the area, check out the Grand Market, ride the Angel flight and enjoy the museum in the same afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C426BAnancyh
50,Well worth making plans!,"We were only going to be in LA for a brief overnight, but had enough advance planning to secure the FREE tickets for entry. That is the only hitch for getting into The Broad, unless you wish to roll the dice and get on line for spots that might open. My husband is not a museum lover, and even he not only enjoyed it, but hasn't stopped talking about it. We arrived the 1/2 hour ahead of time, and actually got in earlier than our ticket time. We also immediately got into the line for the Kusama Infinity Mirrored Room and managed to get a time slot within our limited availability. So worth it!!! But, also, there is a smaller version of this immersive art piece, which doesn't require signing up, and when we got in line only had to wait a few minutes. There are so many wonderful contemporary pieces at The Broad, thoughtfully organized in the galleries. This is definitely a must-see spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Winnie052010

40,Enjoyable and Impressive Venue for Contemporary Art,"While The Broad didn't seem quite as large inside as it appeared on the outside, it has an impressive display of Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Keith Haring.The two open floors were an enjoyable wander through the partitions. The special exhibit SHOULD be included in the price of admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kalickisj
50,Spectacular Architecture and Art,"I waited a while to come here since the opening and I was pleasantly surprised. The building is definitely worth the trip but that would be sad if that were the only reason to come. The modern art is interesting and provocative. It's a good stop on a visit to the Downtown area of Los Angeles, which has many treasures nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tonyk220

Best time to go is early morning or late afternoon to avoid crowd.Great place to be in weekend or week if you do not have 9 to 5 job.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AmazingLucca7
50,Disney and culture,"Great break way to break up a few days at Disney. Introduce your children and group to LA’s Art and Culture scene. Plenty to enjoy by all.First, recommend scheduling visit time. Parking is available in garage just beneath the museum. May be pricey to some but compliments short walk to front doors. So many favs inside but here a just a few.Special notes- cool store inside with contributing artist creations.A cafe and restaurant adjacent to museum to indulge before or after your visit. Be aware if you purchase any chocolates desserts (all of them have nuts in them- for all my nut allergy readers). Lovely coffee/espresso!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ThatGuyJP
50,Free museum (standby tickets) beautiful inside and out,Can’t believe how quickly we got inside this fabulous looking museum despite the brilliant exhibition currently touring. You can pay and jump the line or wait a shirt time and get in free on standby tickets (it’s worth paying for though).The monster elevator jumps you up two floors to be greeted by some of the most attractive modern/pop artists. Each piece has simple explanations and the museum permits very close examination of the exhibits.Truly magnificent,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Luvinspoonful

Great to see Andy Warhol's and the 27th screen print of the famous Marilyn Monroe image.

50,Excellent Art Museum,Loved this museum in downtown LA. It had a special exhibit which I was allowed to visit. There was along line to attend for free. I decided to avoid the line and pay to get in. It was worth it. I spent the afternoon viewing the Soul of Art exhibit. Wonderful works by African American artists as well as other exhibits.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Karolpdx
50,Phenomenal contemporary art museum!,"This is an amazing collection of modern/contemporary art. Warhol, Basquiat, Koons, Murakami are just a few of the many artists featured here. There is also two Infinity Mirror installations on display but please keep in mind that time is limited to 45 seconds. No parlaying here. The Soul of a Nation exhibition is captivating and I highly recommend that anyone traveling to or living in LA take the time to check it out. Admission is free but to view the Soul of a Nation there is a fee. There is also a wait time for Infinity Mirrors and you have to sign up for that at the museum. They will put you in a queue and text you when it is your time. We waited for 90 minutes to get in. Overall, The Broad is a must see if you are into art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuTravelLove
50,Tremendous collection of impactful contemporary art,A powerful selection of contemporary art housed in a sensibly laid out viewing environment. And entry is free. A great gift.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GregMasters
50,Soul Seeking,"We visited the 'Soul of a Nation' exhibition and it was sensational. Normally The Broad is not a top ranking gallery for me. Not because of the collection of works (of which there are many great ones) but because of the atmosphere. It transforms art into a theme park for narcissism and attacks the sacred nature of art by allowing viewers to take continued selfies in front of contemporary masterpieces. However, this exhibition should not leave the building as it makes it infinitely more vital to the city. It is curated excellently and the works included are incredible. Im amazed it was at the Tate first, when it is evidently a vibrant and necessary part of the cities cultural landscape. *note the star rating is based on this exhibition specifically. Not for the gallery as a whole. Catch it whilst you can. You must. Dart right past the infinity rooms. 👁",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kateradartist
30,Not a Must See but A Should See,"If you really like modern art, you’ll spend a long time in this museum, discussing and dissecting the art on the walls and displayed all around. If you’re like me, an hour max is all you’ll need to cruise through and be impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/660rickd

30,The Light Show Disappointed,"Went there for the first time. The special exhibit was the light show.We waited about 2 hours for our turn. Viewed the rest of the Art Museum in the interim. Once its was our turn, limit 4 at a time. The alloted time in the room was about 30 seconds, definitely less than a minute. And none of us were impressed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/534andyd
50,"Extraordinary Experience! World-class...memorable, amazing, A++!","Many superlatives for this Extraordinary Museum...architecture, art, escalator, ""Soul of a Nation' exhibit (through Sept.1), amazing, powerful. Quincy Jones playlist at this exhibit or digital afterwards. There were no free reservations (can wait in line), glad we paid for reservation for this exhibit, then plenty of time to experience rest of the museum. Highly recommend tour (we had fabulous guide)...there is so much art & learning to experience, it made a big difference. The 'immersion' exhibit unusual, but only 45 secs.! To us, 3 hours there, if time, worth every minute; btw, it's a $140 million creation! Check out Disney Hall next door too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mbf18
50,I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS PLACE IS FREE,"(Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) This is an art museum that can be appreciated easily by all walks of life; including the young. I saw plenty of young children gazing wide-eyed at the paintings and teens taking selfies with other art. I appreciate art although I don’t have an allegiance to a style, time, or artist- I’m a regular Joe who really liked this place! The art here heavily leans on paintings by American artists (therefore, rather new in the history of art).LAYOUT OF BUILDINGAlthough the line outside to enter stretched from one corner of the building to the other, we probably waited only 30 minutes. Thankfully, it’s all shaded. Divided into two floors, the majority of exhibits are on the 2nd floor. The escalator that takes you there (going through a ‘tunnel’) gives the impression that you’re leaving Los Angeles and entering a hidden area. In the main area, everything is very spaced out so you never feel claustrophobic or hurried to rush from one exhibit to another. In descending down the stairs, there’s a couple of options to view the museum’s ‘storage’ through large windows.WHAT ELSE IS THERE?During our visit, the trippy ‘Mirrored Infinity Room’ art installment was in action. Due to the small numbers allowed to experience it at a time, museum staff were taking cell numbers; you could leave the museum and the system will text you when it’s your time to enter the exhibit. No need to wait in the entrance line either. There was also an ‘extra fee’ exhibit on the bottom floor which we didn’t enter. Keep in mind, there’s no food options inside, although you’re within walking distance of many downtown L.A. locations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pyra-Danny

50,Great museum,The Broad is awesome! A lot of large scale paintings and sculptures in an incredible space. The building itself is a piece of art and fine engineering. Make sure you put yourself on the waiting list for the yayoi kusama installation when you arrive. It can be up to a 2 hour wait. We loved the museum and so will you!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/andreassK8855LP
50,Life-changing,"What a jewel for Los Angeles! If in L.A., do not miss The Broad. Exquisite building. Wonderful passageway escalator onto the main floor (and elevator that delighted all riders). Incredible collection of modern art. I loved the room where on one wall was a huge photo of the pussy hat/Womens March and on the opposite wall one of riot police obscured by tear gas at Ferguson. How little we have evolved. The Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power exhibit up now is not to be missed and taught me a lot. Staring at art changes your outlook and impacts your soul. This museum (free!) changed my life.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/leew979
50,Best FREE Contemporary LA ART Museum,"The Broad Museum is in the Bunker Hill area of Metro downtown Los Angeles. The building is next door to the Disney Concert Hall too. To visit, you must reserve a preferred day and entry time online at the museum site. Their booking office will then email you a ticket barcode that's downloadable to your mobile phone. My advice as a local LA yokel, is to avail yourself of the FREE online booking. Especially, when the weather in LA starts to get toasty.The 2 big advantages of doing so, is that you don't waste your time waiting hours in a slow moving first come 1st. serve no ticket cue. While you roast in this line under the scorching LA sunshine. Those who book online though, wait for the reserved entry time, in the shade underneath the museum roof over hang. Plus if you arrive around 15mins. early, and your wait time to get in is short. Also, try to go during the week, rather than on a weekend if you can.Once inside the main door, be sure to take a selfie in front of the tall stack of giant dining plates tilting awkwardly to one side. Then make your way up the escalator to the 2nd floor for another photo op with the giant Christmas ornament looking display at the top of the escalator landing. Then wander about a bit, until you find a back hall display of giant wooden dining room table, complete w/4 chairs.I guess you can say, the curators at The Broad Museum have a thing for giant conceptual art pieces that are really cool. And in my humble opinion as a non professional art aficionado, this museum is way better the the MOCA across the street. Plus, The Broad is FREE too.Also, while you are in the area, go down a few blocks to Little Tokyo shopping area. And look for BAE ice cream parlor at 369 East 2nd. Street. And try out the so very tasty Koo Koo for Earl flavor ice cream in a charcoal cone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JoeA239

30,Not Bad for Free,"I had researched this months before our trip, and knew I wanted to see this place. However, I wasted time, and did not get tickets ahead of time. They book out a few weeks in advance FYI. However, I discovered a Twitter page that tells wait times, and we arrived in LA a very early morning flight on a Wed, and I wanted to see if we could make it there by opening in hopes of not waiting long. We did, and waited max 20 minutes. It was a neat place. We did sign up for the Infinity Mirrors, which said 59 minute wait, but we saw the free stuff in maybe 40 minutes. We left after being at the museum a little over an hour, and finally got a text about the mirrors after about 2 hours. We didn’t go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ryanbeckyj

Wish I had more time, did not get to the first floor, probably because we took a break for a bite at Otium, next to the museum--not to be missed either!! probably smarter to get the free online tickets in advance and plan your time there. the contemporary art museum is just down the street but was closed when we got out, easy to make a day of it in that area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LilyChicagoIL
50,A world of modern art,"I didn't know much about 'The Broad' before going, but what an amazing surprise when I found out.It sits next to the Walt Disney Music Hall, which houses the Los Angeles Philharmonic. This building alone is worth the visit.When entering the Broad it is obvious they have some of the best modern artists ever! Warhol, Lichtenstein, Koons, and Basquat. Just to game a few.You will observe the collection with amazement, as because if your a fan of Modern Art, you will not believe the iconic pieces you are actually seeing.I loved the layout as you had the ability to sit and ponder or keep walking and looking.They also have a brilliant gift shop which features some amazing replica and certified smaller art works and gifts.If you in LA and love modern art.

I went without the reserved time slot and it was not a problem at all but I do suggest you get a reservation. My wait time was less than 10 minutes for the visit to the main gallery in the third floor. By the way it’s free. Upstairs they have the most amazing exhibition of contemporary art, as the constantly change I will not mention specifics but every single piece is fantastic. I loved the Jeff Koons Balloon Dog and Warhol and Lichtenstein and so many more. I am sure you will find some of your favorite modern art hero. I went the to see the Infinity Mirrored room by Yayoi Kusama, it’s truly amazing, for this one you do need a reserved slot, so get it as soon as you are in the museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ikemx

50,MoMA means MORE Modern Art in Los Angeles,"The Broad is a collection of art from a couple who collected modern art. This museum is worth visiting in Los Angeles. It's a newer one and it's located right next to the Disney Hall LA Phil building. This is downtown Los Angeles. My father's cousin took me and it was a nice outing. And then we visited USC too. The Broad helps make the LA museum landscape fascinating. This museum did have some new authentic interesting pieces I had not seen in other museums around California! The Broad is worth it and it's free if you get tickets off the internet. You do have to pay for the special exhibition, but it's not necessary unless you really want to. Warhol, Basquiat..maybe no Pollock? Jeff Koons yes and some stuff you have not seen. The building is nice and it's all on one floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bluestravelerz

There was a bit of a line outdoors, we didn’t have a reservation & it was about 2 hours before closing but none of that was an issue because the line moved quite briskly. The exhibitions were INCREDIBLE especially the Basquiat room! That was a complete surprise & I’m obsessed with his work soooo that made my day!

We also got to enjoy the many gorgeous pieces of art which were part of the free admission. This was a MUST DO!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/987mollyl
50,Interesting and free!,Free! But plan ahead I mean weeks ahead or they will sell out. St and by lines not too bad if you go early. The infinity light room too much hype not worth the wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrwheels12
30,"Great building, but the waiting time can be long","Went there with a few friends and did not book a ticket online as it was a spur of the moment decision to visit the Broad. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes to get in (despite being there 15 minutes before opening time). They seemed to let 20 people in every 5-10 minutes, which made little sense as it is a pretty large building that can accomodate more than that (the only other times I've had to wait for 45 minutes was to enter the Uffizi and the treasury at the Tower of London, and in both places, the queue was much, much longer than that of the Broad). The art collection is interesting and representative of most trends in contemporary art - sculpture and installations are under-represented. You must sign up for entry in the Yayoi Kusama installations immediately as you enter, as the queue can be very long - and then you get only 45 seconds to see or be in the room (I was told that when one of the Infinity Rooms was in Denmark, you could stay there for 2 minutes). The architecture of the buiding itself was very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/999olympiab
50,Well worth the price of admission and an hour of your time,"The first attraction I headed for upon arrival in Downtown, I was very happy to find that the Broad was free to visit. After spending five minutes in a queue, I used the free bag drop and ventured up the escalator to the gallery. A great selection of varied pop artists were on display in their own small, separated sections, including the usual suspects - Warhol, Lichtenstein, Murakami, etc. Well worth a visit; will maintain the interest of most for at least an hour.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BillyBobSled
50,Another great museum in Los Angeles,Beautiful building with wonderfully curated collection. Have lunch at nearby or on site restaurant. Downtown LA has changed so much for the better in the last decades,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mmmrunyon
50,Stunning and entertaining museum,Great for all ages. Pop art is a specialty. Order tickets for the free entrance or you will wait online while others breeze in. Online reservations go fast so plan in advance. Vespaio restaurant next door is lovely and affordable - there is no restaurant as yet in the museum. The Disney Concert Hall (designed by Frank Gehry) is nextdoor.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydeleg
50,"Great art, amazing building, kind staff and free entry.",The building is amazing with interseting spaces and lights both in terms of natural light and lighting. I bought the book that covers the whole process from the design of the building to the constuction work. Great exhibition content as well. The staff was kind and helpful. My visit to Broad museum was very pleasant.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/754natasar
40,Modern Art for Free,"Some really great art and some truly strange art, but it is all for free. How can you not love that? It is modern art, so if you are looking for the classics, head to LACMA. This is all about the new kids on the block. All a private collection, it really is impressive.Word to the wise, if you want to do the Infinity Room, get there early. It is free as well but you have to sign up in the queue when you arrive to get your time in there. The queue gets ridiculously long soon. This last time I went with my mom, we got there at 1:30 and could not do the Infinity Room because it was a 5 hour wait.While the museum is nice, it is not big, not like LACMA. It's one building and three floors, only one that is full or art. There is some documentaries to watch to pass some time, but the longest I could see spending there is 3 hours, maybe 4 with some down time and seeing Infinity Room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbyh620
50,Wonderful Contemporary Collection,"The beautiful, modern museum houses an impressive collection of 20th century painters. The museum is free. It is quite comfortable and modern. The works are presented quite well. This is a very enjoyable way to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoufromBoca
40,Cool!,This museum was very cool and had many awesome works of art. They also had a museum shop were you can interesting items. The only thing is that it is a very long wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sahaipanton
40,Quirky and Fun Museum,"Hall of Mirrors was worth the wait. Once you gain admittance, you request a viewing of the Hall of Mirrors and are sent a text when it is your turn to get in a very short line. Just make sure to do this as soon as you can. It took a couple hours on a very busy day, but I left and did some exploring and came back. This is not a large museum. You can easily see all but the Hall of Mirrors in under 90 minutes. The Broad is very close to the Walt Disney Hall, so you can see both easily.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jillnthefort
50,The Broad and area,A wonderful overview of some amazing artist- very easy to do the whole museum in a couple of hours- can go to Moca Across the st too. Good places to eat and the Market under the Omni for quick varied choices is nearby.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joansV593MW
50,Brilliant!,This place seriously boasts of art!! Beautiful pieces of art and sculpture!! Truly worth a visit!! You'll be lost in the beauty and aesthetics of this place!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pal09
50,Amazing - absolutely a must see!,"My daughter is an art teacher, so we always like to visit art museums when we go on vacations. When planning our trip to LA, I saw that the Broad has work by Yayoi Kusama (the Infinity Mirror Rooms). We had missed an opportunity to see a traveling exhibit by Kusama when it came to Ohio, so we knew we had to stop here to see it! The tickets are only available for up to 60 days in advance, and they release one month at at time on the first of the month (at noon eastern time), so I marked my calendar to not miss my opportunity as we were only going to be in town for 2 days. I registered for the very first entry time, and I am so glad I did! We got there about 15 minutes before it opened, and already there was a huge line out the door for the people who had not registered for tickets.When it is your time to enter, you go right in, and then you go straight over to register to see the Kusama exhibit. Since we were so early in the day, we were told to come back in 10 minutes to see the exhibit, so we hardly had to wait at all. We went up into the first gallery room and started to look around, then back down to the lobby for the Kusama infinity room. You are allowed to go in one at a time, or you can go in with the person (or people) that you came with. We did it one at a time, and it was amazing! You only get 45 seconds in the room, but that was enough to really experience it. When we were all done, we went right up to the top exhibit floor to see the other Kusama exhibit. That one you don't walk into - it is walls set up in a round shape that has head sized holes cut into it at different heights. You just walk up and put your head into the hole and you can see into the infinity space. It's kind of fun since your friends all have their heads in too so you see all these different heads! After that we took our time and walked all the exhibit spaces - it is an amazing collection with such variety - it was really interesting. I would highly recommend it! When we were done, we walked out of the Broad and down to the left is the Disney Concert Hall - literally just steps away from the Broad. The architecture is really nice to check out.We then crossed the street and started back towards the Broad, and directly across the street is the Museum of Contemporary Art - we didn't go in but you are able to walk through their outdoor courtyard which has some great sculptures to look at if you are interested.This was absolutely one of our top stops in LA - you really don't want to miss it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98
40,Worth the wait,"Our tour guide turned us on to this place, and I'm glad she did. We wouldn't have gone otherwise. I'm not really an art museum kind of person, but the art was all super modern and the people watching even better. The building itself was pretty cool and the restaurant next door was great for lunch, if a bit expensive. Long line, as it is free, but make a reservation if you go",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ladybugtraveler8
40,Small but fun museum,We enjoyed walking through the different exhibits. When our teenagers enjoyed walking through the different rooms. Great way to spend a few hours,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kmq2000
50,Good but small collection,"We actually spend just 1 hour inside. The place is huge but the good stuff is in just one floor. There was a special exhibit in the lower floor but nothing great.The line to get in takes forever, you can book in advance for free to skip the line but we weren’t sure at what we will arrive so we made the line, it wasn’t long but it moves very slowly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcisinthehouse
50,Cool Museum,"My friend and I went when admission was free one weekend so the line was long but it moved fairly fast. The broad definitely has more unusual pieces of art, like a gigantic table and chairs and a sculpture of a balloon dog. Parking was a little bit of pain but it was fine.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/constancescalia
40,Good Museum,We visited whilst on vacation in the area . Parking is easy on site in a multi storey next to the Broad remember to get the museum to validate your parking ticket to get a discount. Note in order not to que and wait for admission book your tickets on line in advance this will save you time not waiting in general admission line where the ques were long .Once in back packs can be stored free of charge. The exhibits are great from modern scultuputes to paintings to light shows and exhibits something to keep all ages amused for a few hours guides are also informative.Good gift shop on site nowhere to eat on site we found a subway a few hundred yards down the road. Would recommend if you are in downtown LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanS138
40,"Great museum, long wait!","It’s an excellent collection, and wonderful exhibits. The guide giving the free public tour was hands down amazing. Her name was Dana. I learned a ton, and she really transformed the experience for me and my teenage daughter. If you get her, you’re in luck. Although I’m sure they are all great.But - we waited for over an hour outside! Maybe a solution is to have tickets for sale, and just have a limited number per day? I don’t know. It seems counterintuitive to have free entry if the demand is so high. Getting advance tickets was not possible for us - they are sold out for weeks in advance for weekend dates.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carinao625
50,Great for Teens,"As the father of two teen boys, I’m always looking for ways to take them away from their phones. This place is perfect for just that. They explored every detail at The Broad and when asked if they’d come back, I got a resounding YES. That never happens. We will be back in a few months.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Therealrvm
50,Great museum,"If you are ever in Los Angeles, make sure to visit The Broad. Great modern art museum. Admission is free, you just need to book your tickets online in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vmv
50,Worth a visit,Many shows free if you book in advance but not expensive. Friendly staff and great to check out when Downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelebrityTravel
50,Soul of A Nation Exhibit,Wow!! My first visit to the Broad. I need to go back. This exhibit was fabulous and well attended. There was so much more to see at the Broad. I didn’t know that parking was $15. Someone said you could park down the hill for &10. Plan your arrival and parking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliDiva4real
30,Meh,"Maybe I had high expectations, but The Broad just left me feeling meh. I didn't hate it, but I didn't necessarily love it either. It may have something to do with my friend and I waiting for an hour just to get in.Let me start from the beginning. We went to The Broad mainly because of the two Yayoi Kusama exhibits: The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away and Longing for Eternity (both Infinity Mirror Rooms, but on different floors). Entrance to The Broad, as well as the Infinity Mirror Rooms is free; however I strongly recommend getting advance tickets on their website. Also I would suggest getting the tickets as far in advance as possible to ensure that you get in right as they open for there is yet another line for one of Yayoi Kusama's exhibits. We weren't able to get advance tickets and we had to stay in the standby line for about an hour on a Wednesday morning (we were there around 9:20am - they opened at 10am - and we were in by 10:30am). Once you're in, they will direct you to a kiosk where you can sign up in a virtual line for The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away which in itself is only 45 seconds. While you're virtually waiting, you can walk around The Broad which was literally one floor of modern art.If you're curious, head on to the Longing for Eternity first (takes about 20 seconds) and then walk around to observe the other art pieces as you will have plenty of time to do so before you get a text that you can now view The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away.There is a parking garage under the museum which is $15 for the first 3 hours with museum validation; however if you get there in the morning and drive around, there are a few parking lots which charge way less for a whole day.I wanted to see Yayoi Kusama's exhibits so I didn't mind waiting in line, but I wasn't impressed otherwise especially if you have to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnapologeticTraveler
10,Modern museum park elsewhere,"Today's visit to the Broad was a bust. With a 2 p.m. reservation to enter the museum, we pulled into the museum's garage at 1:40 - cars backed up from then on, the garage's exit had cars backed up so as to block access. Terrible. After back-up cleared, went on to look for a space, and as I pulled into an empty space, garage attendant came running - YOU CAN'T PARK THERE! GO AROUND. The space was empty & I can't park there? Other attendants joined in - MOVE YOUR CAR. I drove around to where only tandem parking was available & attendants motioned me in. ""I'm putting you here so you don't have to leave your key."" As if I would - no way. Much of garage is tandem & attendants don't pay attention until you ""do something wrong"" then yell like you're a misbehaved child. By the way you pay 20 bucks for the privilege. Do yourself a favor & park elsewhere. The garage attendants are badly in need of customer service training. Grade F.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeGS
40,"WOW, what architecture, what art!!","Its an amazing building, as interesting on the outside as on the inside. Convenient walking distance to the LA Musem of Art as well as the LA Central Library.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/plazeski
50,"Great museum, thought provoking exhibit 'Soul of a Nation'","Our teens are not really into museums, but this one was a fantastic visit for all of us. Amazing contemporary art, not so large as to be overwhelming. The Soul of a Nation exhibit is more than worth the cost to view. Very thought provoking for our children.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaliKateandCo
50,"Soul of a Nation, not to be missed!!!","As relevant as the art was when created in the 60's and 70's, it speaks to today. With the current environment an important exhibit to understand where we are today and why.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lenetskyshev
40,Worth you time.,"The broad has its own parking. It maxes out at $25 for the day. It's easy and you can walk to other places downtown. It's much smaller than I anticipated. We took our time. Honestly, we enjoyed it but left feeling it was a little too hyped. BUT I could not stop thinking about the Broad after I left and still keep thinking about several of the art pieces. I'm grateful to the Broads for the generosity and making this museum possible. My favorite pieces were Mark Tansey's ""Wake"" and Mark Bradford's ""Scortched Earth"". Both mesmerizing to look at and both with interesting stories behind them. Truly worth your time. You'll need a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TracyJ701
50,Great Downtown Museum,Love this museum with it's ever-changing art. Docents very knowledgeable. Must get tickets in advance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/straidman
50,Jaw dropping art,The Broad is an incredible art collection displayed in a well designed & thought out building. The shear volume of pieces by every contemporary artist is almost overwhelming. Anyone at all interested in modern art should visit. Don’t miss the view of storage space from the mezzanine.....the entire collection is stored on site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christinecG7564WU
50,If you like modern art don’t miss it,"We all loved this place. Our 12 year old boy and 17 year old girl adored it - perfect place for teens. Warhol’s, Jeff Koons balloon dog etc. Yayoi Kusama’s infinity mirror room is must but keep in mind it has to be booked on arrival and is always very busy - when we were there a lot of people were turned away and it can’t be booked until you arrive. The Broad is right next door to Frank Gehry’s Disney concert hall, which is totally awe inspiring.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/532angelaj
40,"Weird, but good",Lots of different modern art. There is enough variety to keep surprising and making you look. I don't always like modern art museums. This is a good one,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/faye57
50,Wonderful space and great collection of modern art!,"*If you are wanting to see the Infinity Rooms exhibit, I recommend going to the museum website beforehand which will explain the process of seeing it.*You are allowed to take photographs for personal use. You may bring in bags under 11x17x8. Backpacks need to be worn in front of you!We were staying at the Millennium Biltmore which was a 5 minute walk from the Broad! (We felt very safe walking in this area!) The Infinity Mirrors exhibit had been on my list since I heard about it when it was in Washington DC! We walked over as soon after we checked in the hotel as we could. It was right at 4 PM and we had not gotten our tickets ahead of time. Tickets were required to get inside although they were free. The Infinity Rooms exhibit was also free but you had to get in another line inside the museum to sign up for your turn to see it. The security guards or docents managing the lines outside were incredibly nice and helpful. They let us in despite the late hour! I asked where to go to check in for the Infinity Mirrors exhibit. The guard/docent told me exactly what to do once we got inside. We were fortunate to be able to sign up and see the exhibit (10 minutes before the museum closed!) While we were waiting for the text letting us know it was time to see the exhibit, we took the escalator up to see the other works being displayed. What a treat! Some pieces spoke to us and others didn't, as with any art. We thoroughly enjoyed our time in this gem of a museum! I probably would have missed this place if not for the Infinity Room and close proximation to our hotel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravelTerrie
50,Spectacular well curated collection,"it had a few art pieces of everything the non-connoisseur art-lover could think of. Loved it!!!! Yayoi Kusama, Koons, Hering, etc. besides, the architecture is beyond perfection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angyee12
50,An outstanding art museum and architectural gem,This inviting space houses a unique and extensive private art collection and special exhibits. It's FREE! Order up to 9 tickets in advance at a specific time and there's no wait. Take your time to enjoy the outstanding collection of modern art on the 3rd floor. Check to see if special exhibits require advance reservation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/12830BarbaraK

40,Missed the Mirrors but it was nice overall,"Honestly, i really only went for the Infinity Mirrors but by the time i was able to get a ticket in, the wait list was already full so kind of a waste for me. But the museum itself has some great works. And the Soul of a Nation exhibited just opened so that seems like its definitely worth checking out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LadyN516
50,Free fun that’s priceless,"If you like contemporary art and want to see some of the most prolific pieces in modern history, check out The Broad. With the self-guided audio device you can check out, be immersed in the world and thoughts of some amazing masters. If you don’t like lines, pre-register online to secure your spot. But don’t worry, you can go impromptu and be standby with up to the minute updates shared from their twitter account for how much longer it will take. We went on standby on a Saturday and waited maybe 20 minutes but it was worth it. Great gift store too!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhxMom99

50,Not your ordinary museum,"We really enjoyed The Broad museum. I'm not really a museum person but this place was amazing. I loved the big, blue glass blow up dog and the huge table and chair display. It's free, but we got tickets online before our trip because the website said there could be a long wait if you didn't get the tickets ahead of time. They weren't wrong; there were a lot of people waiting to get in who didn't have tickets. It was a nice 15 minute walk from our hotel (InterContinental downtown).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B8357YIsharont
50,Intriguing Art!,"So glad we finally came here. Very cool and meaningful contemporary art all under one roof. It wasn’t too crowded and it was a feast for the eyes! I enjoyed reading about the artists and the meaning of their vision on many of the pieces. Not sure I would recommend bringing young children here. The only downfall of our visit was that the first floor was closed because they were preparing for an upcoming exhibit. The gift shop had wonderful books, jewelry and other trinkets to purchase.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/terrihK9755MZ
40,Maybe not the best with children,"We didn't spend a ton of time there, but I thought the 45 or so we did was well spent. I would definitely recommend making a (free) reservation. We had 11 am reservations and got right in when it opened and got right on the line for the Infinity Mirror Room. We loved some of the displays (particularly Jeff Koons work and the giant table). However, some of the artwork was a bit graphic. I was OK with my 11 and 12 year old seeing most of it, but parents of younger children might want to be aware. Definitely head next door to the Concert Hall after and climb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/difish
50,LA on a rainy day,A very cool space with an art collection that will impress even the most jaded. Definitely book tickets in advance to skip the lines and avoid disappointment as tickets do run out. You can tour the collection for free.

50,"Great collection, GA is Free! Just go!","I know a lot of people don't ""get"" or want to ""get"" modern art, but The Broad has a wonderful collection with pieces from almost all of the top names in modern art. Admission is free, though you'll likely have to pay for parking if you drive there. If there are any special exhibits book online ahead of time so your place in line can be saved.I am not an art critic nor am I an essayist so I'm not going to try and describe how wonderful the art is, but to me the collection stands up to almost any other modern art collection on display, and it's free. Just go you really won't regret it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X975TUstevem
50,Check out the free days and times and book online!,"No, we did not get to see the Infinity Mirrors room as we chose not to stand in a line but on the upper floor there is a mini-version of the same room with a very short line.

Do not miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaViajera007

40,Kids will enjoy,"I'll start off by saying that we're not at all knowledgeable about modern art. However we enjoyed the art at The Broad. There were big balloon art exhibits and other pieces that kids would enjoy, names we recognized and some pieces that were very accessible to non-art lovers. Also, while not trying to be offensive, you can easily make fun of modern art and there was lots of opportunity to take pictures and do that. We weren't the only ones! We enjoyed our 2 hour visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LucySlater518
50,"Fantastic selection, lovely experience","Hats off to the Broads who collected and shared their wonderful collection. This free museum is a must-see for 20th century art lovers.

The ticketing system ensures it's not too crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jdhammer

50,Awesome museum but small not a lot to see in one visit,Love the modern art pieces - great eye candy and fun to go to - not very big place though - 2 floors of art and you can get through it in a couple hours. Definitely a must see when downtown LA though!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatieJansenDiamond
50,Infinity Rooms Kusama!,Ordered an online ticket so didn’t queue to get into the broad. Walked pass queue to get into another queue for infinity rooms at midday. Fully booked! Went to level 3 to check out her other exhibits. Came down and they released more tickets for her infinity room! Got a ticket to come back after 2 hours! Got access!!! Must doFor art fans! Broad staff really helpful.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/affy1979
50,The building; the collection WOW,Admission is free but it is very helpful to have a reservation (validated parking is however $15). If you have lots of money you can build a remarkable building to house your collection of 2000 pieces of contemporary art. Not all of of the pieces were to my taste but they were all worth a conversation about what constitutes “art”.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgerhardt
50,Interesting and Free,"This museum has so many intersting exhibits. The best part is that it is free to enter. If you reserve tickets, there is no waiting in the big long line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CodyS1227
40,Great experience.,"Have heard amazing reviewed and had wanted to come for years. Unfortunately, I always waited until the day of to think of the place.It is a small museum. Upper main level has 99.9% of the art. First level has the infinity light and shop.I had reservations for 1130 and was told it would be about 1 hour for the infinity room. One hour and fifty mins later, I tried to check in and was told I still had 18 parties in front of me. An estimate of another 45 min......Overall nice experience. It is next door to the Walk Disney Hall. Close by you will find Grand Central Market. Love this place. Dont forget to stop by to grab a bite to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dreamer803041
20,Not my taste,"I’d been anxious to see The Broad since its inception and was staying near Palm Springs, so made the harrowing, 120 mi., 3-hour (!) drive to it, only to be hugely disappointed.Fortunately, I’d booked 11am tickets and was able to get in early enough to sign up for the mirrored Infinity Room, a fascinating, fun experience. I loved the angled coffered ceilings thruout which allowed in filtered light. That said, I found the collection, for the most part, dark and unappealing.The best thing about The Broad was seeing the magnificent Disney Concert Hall next door!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Char95
40,The infinity mirrors is a must!!!,"Honestly, I cried. The 45 seconds you get inside the room filled with mirrors and LED lights will rock your world.Make sure to be there as soon as it opens, to be able to sign up for the mirrors, there will be a line right away. The great thing about it is that you just put your phone number in, then you're allowed to leave the museum if you'd like and come back right on time for entering. I would also recommend going in to the music constellation by the Icelandic artist. That blew my mind.The Broad is a must, plus it's cheap and there are other museums right across the street, so you can do them all at once.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josefinea2019
40,Worth spending time,Knew to order tickets ahead of time. Could not get in till 5 pm but an hour and a half was plenty of time to do the entire gallery. It was difficult at times to make sure you did not miss anything as the rooms do not flow. The mirror exhibit we had heard so much about was an interesting experience but waiting 30 minutes for 45 seconds was disappointing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/purrcy2016
50,Not a gallery guy - but this was brilliant,"My daughter and I are not gallery people. Our LA hosts raves about the Broad, so I booked tickets online and made it the centrepiece of our downtown LA visit. The building that houses the gallery is itself a star in its own right. The effect the windows create inside and out is stunning. The exhibit on the top floor was wonderful. The Koon stuff in particular is great. There’s some other modern stuff that you scratch your head about - but I guess that is the point. Souvenir shop below is excellent. Glad we copped the tip from our friends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bladdamasta
50,A Highlight of Our Weekend in LA,"First tip: keep checking for tickets to avoid the line. I checked a few times on a Saturday morning, and there was nothing available (besides standby) that day. Then around noon, tickets for 5:00 magically appeared.The admission is free, which is great and also is welcoming too a diversity of patrons, which is fun for people watching.We chose to do the audio tour. It’s only $6 each, which is a nice donation if nothing else. It’s worth it on its own, though it’s not overly extensive.The artwork is really fabulous. I’m sure it rotates, but we got to see several Lichtensteins, Jasper Johns, and Warhols, which were wonderful.The displayed collection isn’t huge, which makes the visit manageable in one to two hours. Also, it never felt overly crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mike95128
50,Interesting and thought provoking,We visited with our three teens and we find mordern art interesting and there’s always lots to talk about. The building is very striking and as is the escalator in the centre. The artworks were in a range of media. We ordered our tickets a month before our visit. And were able to just walk in at our allocated time. For a free experience The Broad was an amazing experience,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaynic
50,THE quintessential contemporary art experience,"The Broad is a gallery of contemporary art on Grand Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, just across from the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Spanning the period from the 1950s to the present day, this is one of the most prominent collections of postwar and contemporary art worldwide.The Broad finds its home in a building of unconventional, innovative design, a distinctive architectural landmark, truly a work of art in itself.Opened in late 2015, and offering free general admission, it has since become very popular with tourists and locals alike. If one wants admission at a specific time on a particular date, advance free ticketing is available online.The Broad is founded by philanthropists and veteran art collectors Eli and Edythe Broad who have been building their collection over the last five decades. Their mission is to make contemporary art available to all and judging by the large numbers visiting The Broad, they most certainly have succeeded.Long time Los Angeles residents, the Broad couple have championed the cultural and architectural vitality of the city for the last three decades and more.As founders of The Broad Foundations (The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation and The Broad Art Foundation), established to advance entrepreneurship for the public good in arts, science and education, the Broads are committed, unwavering philanthropists. The Foundations currently have assets in excess of $2.6 billion.The 120,000 square feet, three storey building that houses The Broad is designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro. Dubbed “the veil and the vault”, the building’s design supports its two main purposes – to provide gallery space for the works of art on display and to provide storage for the large part of the collection not on display at any point of time. Diffused, filtered natural light streams into the building through 318 skylights and windows.In contrast to the solidity of the vault, is the ephemeral veil – the porous honeycomb that spans the entire front of the building allowing filigreed natural light to come in. At the front entry corners of the building, the veil lifts up to welcome visitors into the lobby and the gift shop at one end of it. The veil is made of 2,500 fiberglass reinforced concrete panels and 650 tonnes of steel!On entering the lobby, an escalator carries you up and into the third-floor gallery. Coming down from the gallery, descending the vault as it were, the winding stairs offers tantalizing glimpses into the vast holdings of the collection that are currently not on display.Large parts of the museum’s first and second floors are dedicated to collection storage and visitors can get a peek from the central staircase. This is a novel feature for an art museum, even as it shows off the depth and breadth of the Broad’s collection.At a more mundane level, The Broad has three-storey subterranean car parking - including for electric cars and bicycles.The Broad is an eminently worthy new addition to Grand Avenue’s sterling line up that includes the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), The Music Center, Center Theater Group, LA Master Chorale, LA Opera, LA Phil, the Colburn School, Los Angeles Central Library.Some quick facts about The Broad:• The collection is growing – adding about one artwork every week!• The collection has works by more than 200 artists• The longest artwork is Takashi Murakami’s In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow which is all of 82 feet long!Major, influential contemporary artists whose work is part of The Broad collection include Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly, Joseph Beuys, Jasper Johns, Cindy Sherman, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Robert Rauschenberg, Barbara Kruger, Christopher Wool, Ed Ruscha, Kara Walker, Anselm Kiefer, Mike Kelley, Glen Ligon plus many other younger artists.Two Yayoi Kusama installations at The Broad draw a never-ending stream of curious visitors. On the first floor is the Infinity Mirrored Room – The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away, 2013. Only a limited number of people are allowed entry at a time into this immersive installation with flashing LED lights reflecting infinitely within a mirror-lined room. You physically enter a room with a door that closes behind you for this mind-blowing experience. Given the long lines of visitors who want to see this installation, please book a viewing time as soon as you enter The Broad.On the third floor is Yayoi Kusama’s installation Longing for Eternity, 2017. This is an Infinity Mirror Room – visitors look through portholes at different levels into a mirrored chamber studded with dazzling, flashing LED lights. Since there is a long queue each visitor is allowed only about 30-45 seconds of viewing time of this almost magical work.Other artworks at The Broad that draw a massive amount of visitor attention include:Under the Table – Robert TherrienHustle ‘n’ Punch by Kaikai and Kiki – Takashi MurakamiExelento – Ellen GallagherDouble America 2 – Glenn LigonI…I’m Sorry – Roy LichtensteinBalloon Dog (Blue) – Jeff KoonsPlease see the photographs attached to my review, although they barely give a 'flavour' of the Broad collection.Located in the lobby, The Shop at The Broad retails products that celebrate the works in the collection and the building’s incredible architecture.Photography is allowed without the use of flash, tripods, video cameras and selfie sticks. Food and drink are not allowed within the premises.Directly south of The Broad is a public plaza also designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro. The plaza landscaping has 100-year-old Barouni olive trees and an open lawn. Essential seating is available – this is a great place to enjoy a snack even as you people watch and take in the view.The Broad Hours:Tuesday & Wednesday: 11am-5pmThursday & Friday: 11am-8pmSaturday: 10am-8pmthis installation,Sunday: 10am-6pmClosed MondaysThe Broad is certainly THE quintessential contemporary art experience – we started our visit completely ignorant of contemporary art and artists – we left better informed, and more important, with our curiosity whetted to know much more.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMenon
50,Group visit,"We recently visited with a large group of about 20 people. The museum staff did a great job of escorting us through and showing us around. The museum was incredibly busy, lots of people, so wasn’t a “pure” art experience. However, it was lively, entertaining, and the art is big, impressive and expensive!! I’m not sure how much I learned, or about why they displayed the art the way they did, so I would say the educational mission is “light.” The experience is bold, and with no admission charge it’s quite appealing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh547
20,Eye of the beholder - not for everyone,"Building is very interesting.This is definitely the place everyone is going. But to see Art, or to say they went.If you can book ahead online, it’s worth the time (1 - 2 hrs). Unless you’re artsy type, I wouldn’t spend hours in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NippaW
50,worth a whole day,possibly the most impressive gallery I have been to anywhere in the world - in terms of architecture and presentation of art works. the staff were also super helpful and the App has an excellent guide and information that helps as you walk round. Oh Yea - and the Art id pretty damn good too !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/keefyisback
50,The Building is the Star,"The collection is small enough to take in and of a very high quality. We particularly liked the paintings by Mark Tansey and Ellen Gallagher, neither of whom we knew. But perhaps especially the building itself was what we enjoyed most. The outside is a shell, and the inside has cave-like transition tunnels between galleries. The galleries themselves were traditional white spaces, but the transitions were amazing. One darkened, womb-like tunnel had a huge bulging glass window allowing glimpses into the storage area with glimpses of works not officially on display. Loved it, would go back again today if we weren't back home already.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VancouverViolet
40,Great Art Museum,"I went to Los Angeles over a weekend, it was raining, so we thought we will go to Broad Art museum. It is a great Art museum if you appreciate art and paintings. This place has reasonable collection of Art and paintings.We went directly to the museum, and the entry was free.If u book online, it is 14$ i guess.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiyagarajann2016
50,Incredible architecture,The building is an incredible architecture in the middle of downtown LA. Best Pop art collection. Very unusual collection of art. Recommend the restaurant in their courtyard with the olive trees outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acknowledged101
50,Great contemporary art gallery,"This art gallery is spacious and curated brilliantly, with lots of exciting new contemporary art displays. TheInfinity Room installation by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama is not to be missed!!(better sign up as soon as you get inside the gallery since it's a long wait) Admission is free but there's usually a long lineup if you didn't register online before.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eviy2014
30,not great ... but could be,"second class collection of art work by significant artists. they have one of everything, but collection would be better if focused on unique pieces rather than ... a work by ""X"" just to say they have one",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MJBfromLACA
50,Iconic and it's free,having loose in the plaza where the Broad Museum of modern art is located I have an intimate knowledge of the place. I was lucky enough to be one of the first people to go in before the museum was open. I was there at the opening and I have gone repeatedly. I love the place.if you're finding of the de to do Los Angeles area make sure to go to the website and reserve your place. It's not you're in for a very long line. But once you're inside all the waist is so worth it. Pieces of art sets whenever on this play because they were in a private collection had made it to public viewing for the first time.Don't forget to go by the gift shop as they have some amazing arts and posters for sale.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlainB2394
30,mainstream art,"we booked tickets in advance so we did not wait in line for hours. the collection is very average and nothing special if you are used to galleries in New York or museums in Europe.The exhibition space is quite nice, but not extraordinary. The modern architecture of the building is probably the main reason why I would recommend this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/564-knut
50,Amazing art,"Amazing art, try to engage one of the docents who can explain in easy terms what you’re looking at. One of my favs is the room with this artist. Don’t pass by. Fix your gaze on the center point and wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BobPhibbs
20,Nice from outside and meager inside,"We were impressed seeing a long line of visitors near this museum, so decided to join them and have spent nearly an hour waiting. Waste of time! It is incredible - to spend huge money for a beautiful building containing trash, more trash and nothing beside trash.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeituni
40,The Broad - Contemporary Art Museum,"The Broad is a contemporary art museum in Downtown Los Angeles and is home to modern masterpieces and rotating exhibits.If you know when you will be visiting, free, general admission tickets can be booked online, 30 days in advance to avoid the disappointment of long wait times and also, skip the standby queue.The gallery is spacious and well lit, so be sure to bring your camera and wear comfortable walking shoes as it will take approximately 2 hours to properly explore the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_maka1620
50,Super collection,I loved The Broad. I’m not a fan of modern art but the works were beautifully selected and presented and truly changed my view. The gallery rooms are mostly huge and very well lit. Definitely make your reservations in advance if you can. We didn’t know our schedule so we couldn’t but we only waited about 25 minutes to get in. This museum should be on everyone’s list for an LA visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CohenD1234
50,Brilliant. Just brilliant.,"DTLA is terrific, and the Broad is a key element. For some reason it's free. But book tickets ahead if you can (though the stand-by line was no longer than 5 minutes when we decided to go at the last minute). The collection is spectacular, and the building is interesting and provocative, echoing Koolhaus' work, in my opinion. Jeff Koons, Jasper Johns, a Rauschenberg which Mr. Broad traded a Van Gogh drawing for, for the win! One can only marvel at the Broads' vision in recognizing great artists before they were widely-popular. When you're in East Lansing, check out the Broad museum on MSU's campus - Zahra Hadad! Bravo Mr. and Mrs. Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidbrook2016
50,Fabulous art in an impressive space,"What a treat! And it's free! Terrific representation of a wide range of modern artists. Of particular note is the mirror room - which they organize very well. You sign up and they text you when its your turn to go in. Once in, it's a unique sensory experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ebk16
40,The Broad,"The Broad is a contemporary art museum, on Grand Ave in Downtown Los Angeles and is home to more than 2000 works of art.If you know when you will be visiting, get online and book your free ticket to avoid the disappointment of long lines and not getting in. Tickets are made available one month in advance.Opening hours vary, so it's best to check online prior to your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryM874
50,Absolutely Impressive,Please go visit this place if you find yourself in downtown LA. the architect is so interesting. if you love contemporary art this place is for you! It is located close to a number of other interesting attractions such as the Disney concert hall and MOCA.buy your tickets online as It can get crowded. It is definitely worth a visit!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeniseRSC
40,An Excellent Collection Of Modern Art,"No matter the city, big or small, I always hit up the art museum. Los Angeles is great because there are a plethora of art museums in which to choose. I went to the Broad on a Saturday afternoon and there was a line to get in. This should be expected considering it is one of the few attractions in the city that offers free admission. The Broad has work by some of the best-known contemporary artists, such as Warhol, Koons, and Lichtenstein. I really enjoyed getting to see these pieces up close after only studying them in school. Tip: get to the Broad early so as to avoid the lines and the crowds gathered around some of the most iconic art pieces. Check out the Broad, you won’t regret it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SUBZEROSKIDD10
50,"I'm told it's pronounced ""Brode,"" not ""Broad"" like Broadway. Free doesn't get much better than this.","I like the collection(s) at the Broad better than what I've seen at the Getty. The art at the Broad is just more fun. A room of Warhol, giant furniture or metal balloon animals you wish you could ride, room-sized tapestries made of copper-stitched whisky bottle caps.We just showed up and got right in. Took the Metrolink train to Union Station, the Red Line to Pershing Square. Hitched a ride up Angel's Flight for 50 cents to where the Disney Concert Hall and the Broad sit next door to each other.I guess sometimes the ""public"" line - those who didn't pre-order the free tickets from their website - can get kind of long, but we didn't have to wait at all.Still haven't seen the Infinity Rooms. We'll be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11PaulB
50,Exceptional,"Cutting edge exhibitions, on all the time. In downtown, but close enough to good restaurants to regroup after being blown away!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wendylittles
50,Unique and Eye-Opening,"This is the private collection of Eli and Edythe Broad, which they decided to develop into a museum. It is free to attend, but you need to set up reservations in advanced, or you will have to wait in a line for people who did not make reservations on the day of, and got from there. If you're coming out of town, I absolutely would book in advance. When I went, we got in almost immediately, and the no-RSVP line went much more slowly. There is a lot of focus on modern Black artists, which I thought was wonderful and enlightening. I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life, but was unaware of the local artist Mark Bradford. He is now one of my favorite artists of all-time, not just modern and living artists. They have an impressive selection of Andy Warhol, Liechtenstein, Jeff Koons, Keith Haring, and many others. I'm not going to give spoilers because you really need to experience it for yourself. There are some special showings that you have to sign up for when you get into the museum, but it's not hard or difficult to do. One nice thing about the Broad is that with your reservation, you can go in and out of the museum through the day-so if you need to get food or something, you can do that without it messing up your museum experience. I'm hopeful they'll showcase more Asian and Latinx artists in the future. They have a whole bunch of artworks in the viewable storage area, so they might be there, waiting for us to enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marybelle08
50,Uniquely Los Angeles,"The Broad Museum is a uniquely Los Angeles experience. Situated in downtown, it takes a big of navigating to get there, and it is recommended that you plan in advance. Parking is a big expensive - we parked in a lot about 2 blocks away which charged $10. It is recommended that you purchase tickets online with reservations - although admission is free, there are lines in front, and if you have your tickets you can enter quickly in the general admission line. If you wish to experience the infinity room that is a separate ticket. If you cannot make a reservation for this online it is possible to gain entry once inside the museum at a ""kiosk"" by signing in for an entry time. The museum collection is very exciting and well worth the effort. High energy and well curated, the work is of great appeal to a wide population of Angelinos and out-of-towners alike. Highly recommend. The Infinity Room is not what I expected, however. It is the size of a large closet - though I thought it might be the size of a gallery - it is not. It is small and you are permitted to be inside for about 45 seconds. One is surrounded by mirrors and small lights. It is indeed magical and a unique experience. I'm just not sure I was expecting such a small scale. All in all the museum is a must see while in Los Angeles. I will definitely re visit. When there I recommended stopping at a nearby restaurant for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Voyager310
50,Fun collection for lovers of contemporary art,"Finally was able to make it to The Broad! Was heading to LA for a 3-day weekend trip and was able to get tickets online to bypass having to use the standby line. We were only able to get the last entrance of the day so we didn't have much time but that really doesn't matter as the collection isn't that big. But what they do have is great!We had been wanting to see balloon dog and a few other pieces so we were stoked. Even my dad, who isn't really into contemporary art, really enjoyed it.But ... don't think that the art is only inside. The building itself is a work of art from an architecture and construction standpoint. My hubby and dad, who both work in the architecture / construction fields, were completely geeking out about it and explained just how complicated it was to build.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hendersongal
50,Impressive Building and Collection; Don't Be Put Off by Crowds,"We did not have pre-ordered tix, but the standby line moved quickly despite a *very* busy day in the museum (it was the day of the Women's March in downtown LA). We waited less than 15 mins before being admitted.The facility is airy and fun; the galleries open and flexible. Essential elements for the vast and eclectic collection of art. A nice feature is the window into the storage floor, that shows the un-displayed works.The collection is overwhelming in its size and diversity. But it is well presented so you can appreciate each artist or concept in a manageable viewing. There is something here for every modern and contemporary taste.This is a must see museum for any art or global museum lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Global-Villagerr
50,Awesome!,One of the most beautiful building in Los Angeles. If you have a chance stroll by and take some photos. You will love it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/briandQ3255VQ
50,If you’re in LA and like art: GO,"This place exceeded expectations. It was probably my favorite place that we visited. The art was awesome! So many cool pieces. The place is free also, which can’t be beat. However you do have to reserve tickets.We did not know about the infinity light room on the ground floor. We did not make reservations for that. However we were there right at close and the attendant allowed us to come in. We really appreciated her kindness. Fabulous museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/815maryz

The Broads collect works by well-known, influential artists, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jeff Koons, Barbara Kruger, Cindy Sherman, Jasper Johns, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring ,Cy Twombly, Ed Ruscha, etc. Great to see all of them in one location. The building is interesting too. Admission is free, but best to sign up for tickets in advance so you don't have to wait in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/900LizG

50,A great mUseum,Loved this museum - finally went here more to see the building than the art - but the art was wonderful and the atmosphere is great,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Heather2917
40,World Class!,"We enjoyed this museum so much. Stumbled upon ‘free admission’ tickets the night before, which allowed us to skip the standby line and walk right in. These tickets are available on their website year round, but do sell out so make sure to get them in advance as the standby line can take 2 hours or more.one downside: there’s another line and registration once inside, in order to book a 45 sec. spot for the Infinity Room (famous art installation by Yayoi Kusama). Once we realized what the line was for, there were no more spots for the day (and no more skip the line tickets for the rest of the Christmas break).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Timpossible
40,Pretty cool,"If you're in LA and into museums, The Broad is definitely worth checking out. There's so much to see, even on your way to the museum itself.Be warned though, depending on the day and time, there will be lineups and it can get very busy (as well as traffic getting there).My favorite part of the exhibit was the Infinity Mirrored room, which is so cool! Each person is given a time limit so that once your time is up, you must exit the room. This keeps the wait to a minimum and the line moving.Takes a good 1-2 hours to view depending on how quickly you go through the exhibit but it's worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/essie_xo

50,Interesting Museum,"Free admission! We did not know we have to book online to go in. Fortunately we made it in at the onsite standby line. You don't need to wait if you reserve online and are guaranteed to get in. Lots of people during the holiday season. We did not get into the Infinity Mirrored Room as the line was too long =(The arts are more on the contemporary side, they are fun to see. They are attractive to children.A reminder - parking at downtown is a hassle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/millionsstars
50,Worth the visit but be prepared for some walking,"First, I recommend visiting the web site and registering for free tickets on a particular day and time. Otherwise you will wait a long time to get in. Parking costs $25 and can fill up quickly, so best to get there just after they open. There are special exhibits that require additional sign up and that too is recommended other wise you will waste a bit of time in a line. OK with all that addressed lets get on with the review. I attached several photos and some have comments. All in all it is worth about two hours of you time to visit. Oh yes, no flash photography allowed. Also I do not recommend wearing a back pack, they will make you wear it on the front that and do not get to close to the art work, stay about a arms reach away at all times. There is a gift shop on the first floor but we passed it by.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/donaldfC5122DU
40,Wonderful collection of modern art,"If you're visiting during busy times it pays to reserve tickets on-line via their website well in advance since they're timed entry tickets even though free. We had tickets for the first hour of the day and arrived early (second on line), which allowed us to sign up for the spellbinding Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrors exhibit and walk right in. There's a second one on a higher floor that doesn't require sign up, however there's probably a long line for it if you arrive later.The galleries are beautifully designed and the art is intelligently displayed. There are the usual big names such as Picasso, Johns, Koons, Lichtenstein, Warhol, Hirst, Basquiat, Kelly, Stella, Rosenquist and Rauschenberg as well as fascinating works by artists such as Kara Walker and Mark Tansey.A real gem!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BAM1113
40,Still Worth To Visit,"Though not a fan of modern art as well, I still have no regret to line up for 45 mins to enter the museum. Beautiful arts display.

50,World Class Museum in LA,"One of the best museums in LA, this location and collection can compete with some of the greatest museums in Paris, Amsterdam or Scotland. Entry is free, but you may have to wait in line. The wait is never too long, just be patient and try to arrive early. The collection is modern art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/A1742TFscotts
50,Excellent Museum!,"I'm not a fan of modern art, typically, but I loved The Broad. The architecture of the building itself is beautiful and the exhibits cover an eclectic range of interests. I found some fascinating, some moving, beautiful, and some humorous--all part of the subjective nature of the art experience! Well worth a visit. Definitely request a place in line for the infinity mirror room as soon as you arrive! Incredible, one-of-a-kind experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmBentley
50,Excellent Modern Art Collection,"Spent a lovely afternoon here. Excellent collection of modern art in an interesting building. The collection reflects the interests of the collector, Eli Broad. We visited on a Thursday and the admission was free. So a can't loose proposition. (Don't know if that is the admission policy every day.) The infinity mirror room was a real treat! Put yourself in line for that upon entering the museum, before sampling the artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/myras804
50,Awesome collection of modern art,"Great museum with a cool collection of modern and post modern art and free! Definitely get tickets online ahead of time to skip the line.

50,Unique art presented in a fantastic gallery,"This place is brimming with modern and post modern art presented in an uncrowded way. If you're not an art expert we highly recommend a private guided tour. While the tour is pricey, your experience and understanding of the art will be enhanced tenfold over what you could ferret out on your own.

The artist all singing the ABBA music...great. postwar..contemporary art displays,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jolenew175
50,Incredible Collection,"The building is incredible. Start there. The exhibits are well thought out and displayed. You can also see where The Broads have other pieces in the collection stored. So I’m sure the exhibits rotate or change. It’s incredible to see some of this art up close. They do a good job of not crowding everyone in at one time, the flow also allows you to skip a room and come back later. If you plan to see the Infinity Mirror Rooms make your reservation when you reserve your ticket. We did not and by the time we got there the wait was too long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/megssy
50,Great new museum in Los Angeles!,"Great art, cool building, free to get in, MAKE A RESERVATION.My husband and I went on a weekend, and it was very crowded, but with our timed reservation, we had no issues and didn't have to stand outside for hours in the standby line.Most of the museum is on the 2nd floor, and while the collection is of a decent size, it's not overwhelming. You should be able to see EVERYTHING in the museum within 2-3 hours.Definitely worth seeing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaimaSharoff
40,Great place to spend an afternoon.,"This museum in Downtown Los Angeles is a great and fun place to spend an afternoon. You need to make reservation in order to get in. Several levels in the building offer different objects of art, mostly from American artists, including Andy Warhol. Entry is free but you pay for the underground parking ($15 for Sunday).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/suwannac2016
50,Reserve online to skip the line,"Visited once specifically for the Infinity Mirrors and again recently with reservations to circumvent long lines there is no doubt The Broad ranks among the best free collections of modern and pop art anywhere, the building itself stunning while items contained within including the likes of Koons, Warhol and Haring leave a lasting impression.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/endoedibles
50,A different type of a museum,The tulips sculpture at the top of the stairs really gets immediate attention. All modern art each with its own story. Easy free flowing arrangement that allows to come back to revisit a captivating art. And it is free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hannah956
50,Free,"This beautiful museum on top of Bunker Hill in DTLA is in a landmark building next to the Gehry designed Disney concert hall. Even though the museum is free reservations are recommended. But if you are short on time, just show up. Most times you will be able to get in on standby. As soon as you get in, sign up for the special exhibit (currently Kusama). Start on the 3rd floor and work your way down. Enjoy Warhol and Lichtsteiner. If you are up to it, consider dining at Otium which is next door and run by Chef Hollingsworth who just won the Final Table on Netflix.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SamS967
40,"Stunning building, great collection of modern art","If you don't like modern and contemporary art just come here and study the building. It's gorgeous. If you like modern art this place has something for everyone. The famous standard names are all in the collection (Koons, Lichtenstein, etc) but look at the multi-media avance offerings and the special exhibits that change a lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chinapjs
30,Rating reflects temp exhib,"Broad has some interesting stuff. Still, the recent special exhibits are most noteworthy aspects. It’s permanent collection a little mediocre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RetiredNLuvinIt_11
50,Wonderful Modern and Contemporary Art Collection,"We waited until the crowds died down to visit this museum. Having visitors from out of town finally gave us a good excuse. We reserved our tickets online at the Broad website, so entry was free and easy. The permanent collection is on view on the third level and features work by Jeff Koons, Sam Francis, and Roy Lichtenstein among others. They can only display a portion of the Broads collection, and as you go down the stairs, there is a window into their storage area that will give you a sense of how much more there is. The ground floor is reserved for temporary shows. As is the case, some of the work will leave you totally flat, while others will take your breath away. I was fascinated by ""The Visitors"" by Ragnar Kjartansson. A multimedia piece that features a group of Icelandic musicians performing in a house in upstate NY. They are all over the house at the same time with each room being filmed and recorded simultaneously. Very interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VNahmias
50,Bringing art to the masses,"Luckily we went on a day where the line wasn't too crazy, I've since gone back twice and the line to get in was around the block. It is definitely worth the wait to and appreciate some amazing pieces. I'm not sure if the infinity room is still open but we had to book a reservation to see it when we went.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeendrake
40,"As expected, a great take.","Timing the ticket and my availability was some work but I finally could coordinate it all. The visit was interesting. Modern art is not normally my preferred type but I had to see this museum after all of the hype about it. The building itself was very interesting and unique. Definitely worth the visit. The docents were the most knowledgeable and helpful group I have ever encountered. They are a wonderful asset to the museum. This is a museum that should be seen, if only to have been exposed to its form of art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/929ch
50,Beautiful place with interesting works of art,"I found this free art museum more interesting that several I have visited and paid $10 or more to visit. I especially loved Jeff Koons “Balloon Dog” since I learned to do that will real balloons, I was amazed at the way he made the twists look like they did on my work with all the wrinkles that appear when the balloon is twisted. Recommend making a free reservation on line rather than standing in line to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ricrac491rics

40,One not to miss downtown LA,"Go see their Infinity Rooms and the whole trip will be worth it. Kusama is a great artist and add to that the other exhibits in the Broad, everything from Warhols to Koons, it'll do for a great morning to enjoy. After that if you go to the Grand Central Market, have an oyster or a pupusa..your day will be as nice as possible. Take an Uber back or the metro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZmixVal
50,Contemporary arts that twists your mind,"This museum has free admission but it’s best that you book your tickets in advance online. Otherwise, the queue is terribly long in the morning.Upon entering, best to go straight to the Infinity mirror room. Again, I heard the wait could be up to 5 hours. I was able to enter without waiting since I was there 30 mins before the museum door opened.After the ground floor infinity mirror, best to go straight to 3rd floor mirror display. Again, there was minimal waiting when I got there. The rest you could tour leisurely.There was a movie room and I watched briefly. There was also a robot room that requires advance booking but I didn’t know about it. Waited for 30 mins but couldn’t get in so gave up.Some arts I could appreciate, some didn’t hit me. I love the balloon dog and the giant table and chairs.Worth a visit. Total trip was 1.5 hours.Parking on side street on Sunday was free.Angy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngyChin
20,The building was more interesting than some of the Art features.,"First of, the allure of this eggshell lattice print encapsulating the building is beautifully designed with venetian plaster like a fluffy cloud. The facade draws you in as the unconventional entrance is the sharp corner of the building that's been sliced at the base. As the attention to detail of the building brought high hopes to what's inside, I was largely disappointed. Many of the art installations looked like a lack of effort. Is it suppose to look unfinished? That appeared to be the theme that day. Maybe it was intentional to juxtapose the other art pieces that were absolutely amazing. One I was so amazed with is Elliott Hundley's layering collage and intricate use of pins and his classical and contemporary references. The way I see it- I find enjoyment from an art piece by envisioning the artist building from scratch endure significant blood and sweat while viewing their finish product that no one else thought of or can replicate.Not looking at photographic portraits (I know it's been featured in many popular places but it does nothing for me). Or a painting that still had sketch marks on the canvas like it ran out of paint.Maybe I went on the wrong day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sightsee31418730689
50,amazing,Love museums ... its nice to have access to art .. new and old... its nice to learn and be a part of this type of event. Its good place to open you mind to what is in an aritsts mind when they are creating such pieces. As a young person i didnt appreciate it but as an adult its is part of me that builds on my knowlegde and things to do list.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555detteb

50,Family Vacation,Took my daughter (15) and her friend (18) to Hollywood they had seen this museum online as a great place to take photos but it turned out to be much more. They enjoyed all the artwork and displays plus it was FREE a win win for me!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tinalP8831PC
50,Fascinating collection and building,"Contemporary art could not have a finer home. The Broad's collection is impressive. A lot of the collection is very large and perfectly exhibited. Although this museum is free, you should go on line for reservations. The museum employs a lot of assistants so there was never anyone very far away when we had questions. I would like the audio guide expanded to include more of the art, and to discuss this amazing building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/patriciafT7253FH
50,Beautiful modern art gallery - must visit!,"We had such an amazing experience here. We got to see the famous light room exhibit and some beautiful modern art pieces.I suggest booking online ASAP to skip queues out the door and also to book for the light room as soon as you get inside. You will have a multiple hour wait until you can enter the light room exhibit and they will text you when it is nearly time for you to enter the room so I suggest for you to go to the Broad the first thing in the morning, book your spot in the light room and then leave the gallery to do something else. We went to the farmers market and came back when they texted us to check out the light room and then the rest of the gallery.This was one of the highlights of our days in LA. You can spend a very short time here checking out cool looking pieces or stay as long as you want. My suggestion as just do everything you can to avoid the queues as I mentioned above and you will have a very satisfying experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamuele

50,Great Museum - All The Modern Art Favorites,"The Broad is a great museum and features many contemporary, well known artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Jeff Coons, Andy Warhol, and many more. Also on exhibit was a very cool Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirror Room. I went on Thursday evening, when they are open late. I made a reservation, which were recommended and crowds were not too bad. I also registered when I walked in to see the Infinity Mirror Room, which was awesome. When visiting the infinity room, only one person is allowed in at a time for 45 seconds. I recommend reserving this ahead of time. There is a lot to see, but doable in a two hour time span. If you like modern art, this museum will really appeal to you. Its highly recommended if you are in downlown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gwardbeeler
50,Great Museum,Free and just great! the building and the exhibitions were fantastic. We booked in advance (that really help to avoid queing for too long). The Yayoi Kusama exhibition was great and fully recommendable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelWorldMap

This is a definite place to visit for everyone visiting or living in the LA area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magfamily2016
50,Free Artistic Fun,"Visited this museum. Tickets are free, but open up online about one month prior to each month for availability. For instance, if you are visiting in December, the tickets for December will open on November 1st. The museum has several interesting exhibits including the Under the Chair exhibit which makes you feel as though you are in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids movie. :-) It's worth a visit. If I remember correctly, parking was about $15 flat rate in covered garage of museum area for all day parking on Saturday when we visited",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTTworldtraveler
50,Epic,"I usually can't spend more than an hour in a museum because of the UV lights, that and the art starts to feel repetitious.I can't say the same for The Broad. Firstly, there is natural light upstairs in the main gallery that floods in and gives a very natural feel to the space. Also the artwork is not crowded on top of each other. Each room is very different yet doesn't feel jarring when you change rooms.We went with my wife's family and the kids loved the sculptures. Usually when the kids get together it can be a bit of a mess but because of all of the different pieces for them to look at, they were well behaved and it was a great experience.The best part of the whole thing is that the museum is FREE.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashtanganurse
50,Great Art and a great cetral location,Had a great meal just outside before spending a few hours going through all the gallery's Some great Worhol pieces but my favorite was the Infinity mirrored room by Yayoi Kusama,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255kieranw
20,Dissapointed,Free. Closed Monday's. Not for me. Disappointed. I thought the 'art' on show was boring. We got in the standby line and it didn't take long to get through. Wish I hadn't waste the time,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/108lauram108
50,Spectacular Museum!,"Don’t miss out on a visit to The Broad! This was such a pleasant surprise and has been one of the highlights on my trip to LA.Tickets are free, but you should book in advance on their website if possible. You are allowed re-admission for the full day, so arrive for your time slot and then come back if need be.I was disappointed that the wait time for Infinity Mirrors was so long (2h 45m), I was not able to see it, but this museum has such a lovely collection and is displayed so well it softened the blow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carawasthere
30,Some iconic modern art...and some laughable “art”,"This is quite a museum. The Broad family spent $100+ million to erect a building to house its collection of modern art. That’s quite a contribution to downtown LA, and it’s been very popular since its opening a year or so ago.We certainly enjoyed seeing works by Warhol, Jasper Johns, Liechtenstein, Koons and a handful of other pillars of modern art.However, some of the “art” is worthy of a belly laugh and little else. The explanations of the motives, objectives and messages of many of these artists is explained in the most tortured, pretentious language I have ever read.My favorite is the “art” that was phoned in...literally. Attempting to demonstrate that creating art does not require hands-on involvement, one artist called a sign painter, dictated a few mundane lines from a periodical, and had the resulting “art” hung on a wall somewhere. It would have been a great Bob Newhart skit. (“Hi, Jimmie? This is Morty...the artist up the street. Yea, thanks, doing well. Do me a favor, would you? ....”)Another favorite: the German post-Nazi artist who plucked a Red Cross sign off the wall and autographed it. That’s it. Kidding, right? Nope.At the end of the 90-minute walk through, I remembered that it had been 55+ years since I read the “Emperor’s New Clothes.” I wonder if that book is in the Broad family children’s book collection?The main part of the museum is on the top floor. It is well laid out and a easy to navigate.Go if you have the time, but don’t expect to be wowed or moved.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rpmc47
40,Fun and quirky modern art museum,"I'm not normally into Modern Art, but wanted to check this place out for the architecture. It doesn't disappoint. This building sticks out among the others on the same street. Inside, its an interesting space which does a great job of displaying the various art for viewing. You get timed tickets, and it isn't very crowded. It is a nice place to visit if you have some time downtown and want to see something different. It isn't huge, but a decent size - could take from 1- 2 hours to see everything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850dd

The collection here is really spectacular and wonderfully curated. One of the most memorable experiences at an art museum, for sure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/strudel01
50,Nice and free ticket musuem.,The broad is not a large musuem but very nice. You can make a reservation in advance or just walk in. If you choose to walk in you need to wait in line but not long time. There are 3 floor each floor shows different style of art.I think the signature of this musuem is the mirrored room which when you entrance you need to make a reservation again to go in and you can spend only 45 sec in that room.Anyways it is valueable to wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/394minnie
50,Great for architecture and art fanatics,"My partner and I love visiting for the exterior architecture shots that we can get as well as the entertaining exhibits inside the museum. The best collections always cause the longest lines, but they are worth the wait. Go early during a weekday for the shortest wait. And the building is endlessly inspiring for a photographer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KirstenAlana
50,Coolest modern art collection in USA + 3 secret tips!,"Eli Broad chose excellent architects to display his phenomenal collection, and wisely hired smart curators to display these artworks in a stunning setting. What you first notice even before walking inside is how many visitors appear to never have been to a museum before, and how the staff are so cool and welcoming. Broad is a true philanthropist, who generously makes this massive collection available free of charge to the public; moreover the venue offers free tours so that the public can learn about these works of art.3 secret tips:1. Show up later in the afternoon, even on a Friday. You can get last-minute admission faster; I waited only a few minutes to get in.2. Take a photo inside the incredibly hip elevator (see photo), and ride it in at least one direction -- preferably going down as you can ride the great escalator up (see photo).3. As soon as you arrive, enter your name and phone number on the waiting list to visit the incredible ""Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors"" special exhibit. You only get 45 seconds inside the room, so plan your visit accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevenm00001

50,Highlight is the Infinity Mirrored Room,"The Broad is a contemporary art museum in Downtown LA. The museum has very beautiful building which becomes prettier in the lights at evening. The museum is named for philanthropist Eli Broad. It opened on September 20, 2015. The Broad houses a nearly 2,000-piece collection of paintings, sculptures and photographs of many artists. General admission to The Broad is free. There is always a long waiting time for Infinity Mirrored Room. To experience this artwork, a separate signup is required after you enter the museum with your admission ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VIPIN_GOEL_TP_Impex
40,"Modern Art, Interesting concept","The building is a gorgeous piece of architecture, no doubt about it. Once you enter there's a couple floors to visit filled with intricate art you have to think twice about.Be sure to book ahead of time for easy access, sadly can't do quite the same about the famous infinity room. When we checked in, it looked to be about a 3 hour wait to get in, I heard from another visitor that at one point the wait was 5 hours. If you have the whole day there, sure, though, there's only so much to see in the museum.A small fun alternative to the infinity room, was the infinity box(?) which had a short line but allowed you and a few friends to put their heads in a box filled with mirrors and lights... It's a lot of fun! Some of my favourite pieces were the Balloon Animal and the Murikami exhibit.A good way to spend an hour or two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/55felicer
50,"Stunning architecture, fairly small collection on display","The building is clearly what I liked most. It looks fantastic, as does the nextdoor Philharmonic Concert building. Inside, there aren't that many pieces on display, and some rooms are far more attractive than others. Quite a line to get in without a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seasondtraveller
50,Amazing!,"One of the greatest collections of contemporary art I've ever seen, very iconic pieces. The museum is rather small, so it's not overwhelming. Great architecture too. I came there around 6 p.m. and there was no queue in the stand-by line, I just walked in, the only thing I couldn't see without an advanced booking was the special exhibition. - And the most incredible thing, it's all for free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/minou-grou-grou
40,Can't Be Beat for Contemporary Art!,"Striking architecture. Next to Disney Concert Hall, the pair are top flight examples of new and beautiful architecture. Entry is by long escalator (There are stairs and a very modern elevator). At top of escalator through a tunnel-like structure, one arrives in a large open room in the middle of Level 3. There is ahead a massive stainless steel, multicolored work looking very much like a very large balloon sculpture ('Tulips'). The far walls show a phantasmagoric colored painting, 'In the Land of the Dea, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow' of multiple figures and objects. This whole level is one contaning striking contemporary works. Don't miss the 'Longing for Eternity' infinity mirrored work. This is accessed only by obtaining a ticket in the lobby as one enters. It is very difficult to get the special ticket as this has very limited space. Level 1, the ground floor, has rotating temporary exhibits, restrooms, the shop (limited as museum shops go), and a restaurant on the plaza inside/outside. During this reviewer's visit in late September 2018 the key exhibit, and one not to be missed, is 'The Visitors.' This portrays eight videos of performers in various musical genres playing in unison (64 minutes long but one may enter and leave at will). Make sure you Google the work before attending. Tickets for the Broad are free but parking is very expensive. Underground parking is available under the Disney and Broad Buildngs. Advanced online (free) booking is recommended and mandatory on weekends and holidays to avoid very long queues. A must-see experience for art lovers of all kinds. It is a mind-expanding and culturally important experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnH881

50,Extremely Well Curated,"We were impressed by the curation and display of the Broad's rotating collection. We were able to enter in less than an hour from standby.

50,Well curated collection of contemporary art - and FREE!!,"The permanent collection of contemporary art collected by the Broad family is extensive and wide-ranging. Only a small percentage of their collection is on display at any one time, so when going back to see a new temporary show it is likely that you will also see a lot of new works in the permanent (third-floor) collection.The staff was extremely helpful, managing the lines (with and without reservations) and providing directions, etc.The Broad's endowment also ensures that admission to the museum is free at all times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/132TomG

Shop rather underwhelming but restricted by size.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Camda
50,"Great collection, and a good anchor for local adventures in DTLA","We were able to get the free tickets reserved online with only a days notice on a Thursday, They don't have a good mobile solution, so you need to have a printer available. Be advised your entry has a 30 minute window, after, in case you're running late, but on an uncrowded day, you can also enter a few minutes early. If you have a few minutes to spare before or after, you're just two minutes walk from the Angel's Flight rail, so much fun for $2 round trip",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WesSDCA

Upstairs at the Broad is an exceptional and fun exhibition of modern art, all displayed in an airy and spaceous gallery setting. The entire museum is a wonderful treat. It is one of the premier modern art museums in California and compares well to the top floor of the Pompidou in Paris, although focused on art after 1940. I love this place.It is free except for the special exhibitions and Infinity exhibit. You can reserve your tickets online or wait in line to get in. Plan ahead to get your tickets. Special exibition tickets also allow entry for the regular exhibits. Tickets are timed.The Broad is also across the street from MOCA- Musuem of Contemporary Art and both are doable in the same trip.

50,Great place to see,This is a free museum and usually a line. BUT if you go on the web site you can reserve your spot/ticket for a time then limit the amount of time you line up...still free. The place is amazing and worth a large admission fee even though there is none.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauracG7401QL
30,Checking out LA,Nice and unusual architecture… Nothing to write home about. Took it in while walking the downtown area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/350jimmyn
50,modern excellence,"The space itself is worth a visit, and then the art collection on top of that... we loved it. And pre-buying tickets made it super easy to get in and out while avoiding the long lines that otherwise form.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Willtravelforfun
50,Invigorating and Fascinating Modern Art,"My wife and I spent several hours at The Broad and enjoyed every moment of it. It was not quite up to the level of MOMA in New York, but was nevertheless filled with art work that I could spend long periods of time observing and contemplating and I would love to go again.Three memories stand out. First, the Infinity Mirror was like nothing I had ever seen and was worth the wait. (Their reservation policy makes sense, by the way.) Second, The Visitors was a fascinating nine-screen film that was was fun to watch and fun to see how others responded to. (I believe that is temporary.) Third, during a tour, I appreciated how the tour guide was very accepting and even encouraging when I criticized one piece that he had just finished describing as lacking any artistic merit, and engaged me in further discussion about it.Overall, this was an afternoon my wife and I enjoyed very much. We have talked about the art we saw for weeks since our visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z9571ATnicholasw
30,Ok for being free.,"My kids and I went here because it was free. My daughter had reserved tickets (free tickets) for a specific time frame. The staff were not the greatest. The ones outside just let anyone in, even though they didn’t arrive and stand in line at their scheduled time like the rest of us. And the ones inside were rude. Don’t dare to even try to have fun in here. It’s all very serious.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/939marissah
10,Awful,"For starters you have to book to go into the light/mirror room but on the web it says nothing about booking except to get into the building . Secondly , some of the staff are rude and moody I would not recommend this for people under 50 unless you are into boaring stuff and getting bossed around by staff .",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/m00dymargret
40,Great museum,"We only really wanted to see the infinity mirrored light room as we had heard how fab it was. We pre booked tickets to enter the museum to save waiting in line. Unfortunately as the traffic was so heavy we didn’t reach the museum until 7pm. Although we were late for our ticket we were still allowed entry into the museum but as you have to then queue to get a ticket to get into the mirrored room we had missed all the slots so could not go in. So disappointed. However the artwork on display was very interesting. Tip, book and earlier slot in the day to insure entry into the infinity room",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1972nessie
50,More than mirrors,"Don't get me wrong, the infinity mirror rooms are great, but I hadn't realized how wonderful the rest of the museum would be. I especially enjoyed the Lichtenstein collection and The Visitors by Ragnar Kjartansson. I definitely recommend reserving tickets in advance (it's free). The line to get tickets day-of wrapped around the building. We got the earliest available slots on a Friday and didn't have to wait in line at all. We did have to get in line for about 10 minutes to get in the queue for The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away. Even in the earliest time slot we still had a 30 minute wait to see that room. If you can't get there early, you can probably still see the other infinity mirror room Longing for Eternity as it has a smaller line upstairs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/raquel9e
40,Worth the trip!,"I’m admittedly not the biggest fan of Modern Art. Still, it’s worth the time to go to The Broad, especially if you book your (free) tickets in advance.The museum is well laid out and there’s multiple ways to learn more about the art on display (The Broad has its own app).The upstairs (3rd floor) has the most pieces on display. Start there and then return to the first floor for the smaller exhibit hall and small gift gift shop. All told, expect to be there about 2 hours for a good viewing of the museum; more time, if you want to read every placard and/or need to wait in line for a limited-access exhibit like the Infinity Room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EditorCJP
30,Show off!,"Since modern art became such a trendy thing, every town needs a modern art place, built by a famous architect, filled with modern art.So far so good. The Broad makes not much difference. The building looks spectacular, the lines for waiting are long, but what you get inside is quite average. If you are into modern ar and have visited places around the world, you do not need to take the waiting time, because it is simply not worth it. Ave a look from outside, it is good enough!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pkabel
50,Book Tickets online to Avoid the Wait,"We booked our tickets one month ahead of our visit and It definitely facilitated entrance. There was no charge and I had my choice of arrival times.Under the Museum is their own parking garage. Parking cost $15 for unlimited weekend parking but only covers 3 hours on the weekday. You would just pay an additional hourly fee for longer parking.The standby line at 9:45am was already curving around the front of the building towards the parking lot elevator. For the ticket holder line we were within the first 20 to enter. Only after the reserved ticket holders entered then the standbys were let in. The advantage of reserved tickets allowed us to queue in front of the Infinity Room exhibit. Each group was able spend about 45 seconds inside which was enough to experience the exhibit and take selfies. The museum staff used stopwatches to time the visits so they were serious about time allotments. That room was one of the highlights of our visit.As we wandered around the 3rd floor we got to see some works by well known artist like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns plus many others from Europe and Asia. There were paintings, a huge dining table and chairs, and sculptures all laid out to focus on the art.No water or food allowed inside. Backpacks must be worn in front. No flash photography.We also got a peek, walking down the stairs, of the storage room and more artwork inside.Will be coming back here again in the future.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wireless_in_CA

50,Best Museum ever!,"What I liked the most of The Broad Museum was that the selection of art is really good, they have interactive art also as modern art. The building is beautiful, specially the lobby, it's just breathtaking. On your way out, make sure you check out how they conserve the art, this is something that really caught my eye because is something that you don't get to see, it's really interesting how they conserve the art!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luispedrogramajo
40,Nice place to spend an hour or two.,"We booked online for the free visit (Be sure to do this in advance) which was seamless.It's a lovely looking building with some great art inside.Spent around an hour inside, well worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/finchy3
50,A modern art marvel,"This is the latest of several modern art museums in LA in the last 20yrs. You will need reservations to view the permanent collection and special exhibits, but most(all) are free. Make sure you check the website as soon as possible, and schedule both general admission and special exhibit reservations. Entrances are timed, so make sure you arrive early to make your slot. There are generally 2 floors of art on view available to the public. The ground floor has the special exhibits and gift shop. The 2nd floor is where the permanent collection is housed. You will be treated to a great collection of the greatest hits of modern masters: Pollack, Warhol, Litchenstein, Rauschenberg, Johns, Ruscha, Miro, Twombly, de Kooning, as expected. Also, some lesser known modern artists, particularly women and people of color. Make a whole modern art day of your visit by going to MOCA across the street and eating at the beautiful Otium restaurant. Do not come here if you want to see Monet or Picasso, tho.. save that for another trip to LACMA or the Norton Simon. I've been 6 or 7 times since their opening and it is still a pleasure to go each time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/justsandra13
50,A really fun experience,I totally enjoyed my visit to the Broad. It has interesting architecture. I especially liked the clear glass elevator in the middle. I also liked the art collection which was eclectic and I thought reflected a sense of humor. The Jeff Koons pieces are wonderful. Most people walked around smiling and seemed to be enjoying themselves.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wardnick1
40,Contemporary Art on a scorching day,"Due to construction and a movie screening, parking was a challenge.Note*** keep on moving don't park in the structure on the left hand side as that is for residents only!Parking is to the right of the building, $15.Take elevators up to entrance.Get your tickets online in advance.My baby cousin visited from out of state.We wanted to do something fun.So the goal was "" Infinity mirrors"" by Yayoi K usama.We were scanned in given highlight info on the exhibits, I asked about the infinity mirrors, was told that was booked up for months.Umm we didn't drive 90 mins for nothing.Asked another worker, told oh sign In, on the iPad and if there is opening you will be alerted.We did, meanwhile went and looked at some captivating exhibits..Yes, they had some pieces from Jean-michel Basquiat!!There was alot of people as groups trying to get out of the heat.We received the long awaited page to line up for the Yayoi event.A sign is posted to prepare.Only few may enter at a time.We enter and with the lighting and placement of mirrors, absolutely cool!Will return when it cools down and is more quiet to enjoy the works.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IESHORTIE
40,"Interesting space, worth a look","The Broad is a free museum, so I was nervous about how crowded it was going to be, but overall, I found the experience to be a pleasant one. In my opinion, there is no real need to wait in the extra queue for the Kusama infinity room (especially if you have visited other infinity rooms). Given the number of people they are trying to get through the space, you do not really have enough time to fully experience it, and it is, in the end, underwhelming.The special exhibition space was not open while we were there for some reason. That was a bummer, because I definitely thought we were going to be spending more time there than we did.Hot Tips!- Go on a weekday, and get your timed ticket for first thing in the morning (especially if you want to get into the second queue for the infinity room)- A lot of pieces seem to attract crowds because they are ""Instagrammable"" - go off the beaten path! Check out the stuff that isn't surrounded by selfie-takers, and you might be surprised!- Go in with an open mind! Modern and contemporary art can be challenging, but some of it is really worth seeing.-Eat somewhere else downtown! The adjacent restaurant is HELLA pricey, and while it is good, you can get really decent food down the hill for half the price.- Don't touch the art, man! Also, don't walk backwards in any gallery with your phone in your face. Trust me, it WILL end in disaster, and that selfie ain't worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ImekaSF
40,The Broad Is Great For Pop Art,"Wonderful private museum featuring pop and contemporary art. You'll find lots of colorful Koons sculptures. A room for Rauschenberg, Warhol, Lichenstein, and others. Multi-media also. Start up on 3 and then come down to the lobby. But secure your ticket for the Hall of Mirrors first. Look for a standing I-Pad by the window area. You'll probably find an attendant there to help you. Admission is free and it's best to secure a time on-line. This museum seems really popular with the younger set.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zoom_Gotti
50,Second visit. Still impressive.,"Comparing to the Broad back in summer 2016 when I first visited, the art on display do not seem to have changed much. There’s still these panoramas of colorful pieces greeting you at the entrance, and the line to the infinity mirror room stays overwhelming (you, of course, do not get to realize about its length since they use a digital system for the line-ups. Only the numbers on their iPad shock the innocent visitors chanting “omg they don’t have a line”). However, I still enjoyed it absolutely. The museum was cool, quiet and uncrowded as always (even for the Saturday when I was there). The pieces deserve a second and even a third look, and the great variety of art types there satisfied me although I am more of a classical art fan. I wish they could add more descriptions for the abstract pieces though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/qinghuix

My Friend - Jill - works there and gave me a private tour and the museum has lots of interesting exhibitsIt is a fun way to spend a few hours, and I am glad to see a new place like this",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/old-man-orange
30,Disapointing,"About 15% of the art shown in this museum are 5 star. The rest is pretty poor.Mr.Broad has done some wonderful things for the city of Los Angeles...hopefully, he will upgrade the displays at this museum. The building itself is a work of art, and worth seeing inside and out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SharonA966
50,"Amazing museum, a MUST !","One of the best museums we have visited around the world. Very interesting building, as well. Not too big, great for kids. Tip: “buy” for free your e-tickets, to avoid long lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Yolyni
40,Interesting Art,Went here this past Sunday. We had read the reviews that said although it was free you might have to wait in long lines. When we arrived there were only a few people waiting in the general admission line. We ended up waiting about 5 minutes. It is a free museum which made it even more worth it. The art was interesting as modern art usually is. We definitely enjoyed some more than others. It's certainly worth the visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cttraveler66
40,Awesome building - a creative experience you can enjoy in one visit,You have to call the First day of the month to get free tickets for the following month. Then you get right in. Register for the special exhibits as soon as you get Inn the door.Lots of well knows Contemporary Artists. Jeff Koons exhibit when we were there. Do be sure to go.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/etnbanker
40,Nice for a few hours but park elsewhere!,"So first of all, unless you can get advance tickets you will wait 20 minutes to 2 hours, and it varies quite a bit.There are a few iconic items, like Jeff Koons' ""Balloon Dog"" and some funky stuff and some weird stuff. Currently there is an LED light mirror room (separate sign up once you're inside for that) and a mirror pillar thing in an upstairs corner.It's not a huge museum, we saw everything in about 3 hours, not including a duck-out to the cool Grand Central Market for lunch (with a return up the trippy little Angel's Flight mini-tramway.At the end of which the parking was $25 (!!). I knew that going in, but we were running late to meet someone. Research a bit to find other options-Music Center maybe, or there was a lot kind of across Grand Avenue which was $14 max.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/870tobym
50,The Broad Collection is awesome,"This is a place where all the good art lives. if you get the chance to get a ticket and check out the Broad, the time is well spent with all the wonderful art they have in their collection. Parking is easy. A must see in this place is Kusama's infinity room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ispeakfoodtooblogger
20,Poorly organized reservation system,"Making your reservation a month in advance apparently doesn't help if you are hoping to see the infinity room. We got there early, went immediately to register for the infinity room, and were told it was an additional 4.5 hour wait. It's not like there is enough to see or do to occupy that amount of time in this tiny museum, so of course, we didn't get to see it. I recommend any of the other wonderful museums this city has to offer instead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tania012016
50,Goooooooooo!!!,"This was one of the coolest art museums that I have ever visited. Make sure you get your FREE tickets online before going because the standby line is loooong!! Plenty of parking underneath, but its $15 (Well worth it to us), but don't forget to the get yellow card validation before you leave the museum. Enjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/we_out
50,The Latest in Contemporary Art in LA!!!,This is one of the latest attractions in LA and really cool if you have a few hours to spare. This museum was made by Eli Broad-Billionaire Philanthropist and has several unique collections of contemporary art. The infinity room built out of LED lights and glass( the souls of million light years away ) is simply awesome and stretches your imagination. The music room is very unique. There is a line for the infinity room of about 2 hours on a Sunday and you have to book as soon as you enter the museum.The wait time to get into the museum is about 20 minutes if you did not book online.The other collections ( about 2500 ) are quite varied. There is parking in the same building ( about $15 for all day ) and there are several restaurants around that place.The Broad is quite small compared to Getty Center but definitely worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paulrupesh
50,With timed tickets its a cinch...,"We are native to SoCal. We live in Santa Monica. And for years now we have been put off by the scrambling for tickets one has to endure if one wants to visit The Broad. (It is pronounced BRODE - long ""O"" - and while that doesn't matter much - Eli Broad would probably tell you the same.) Contrary to my initial thoughts, the online ticketing process where you choose your timed entry was so easy, worked well, and actually made our visit much better. Also, timed tickets mean fewer people trying to see that works of art at the same time. The collection at The Broad is important...and well worth the investment of your time to get in the place and that's good to know. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgtravers
30,"Free, but book online in advance and feel like a VIP","Waltz past the lines of those who didn't reserve and walk right in on your timed admission. Remember to sign up for ""MIRRORS"" room before you tour the rest and they will text you for your timed admission to the 45 second experience. But if you forget, you can afford to miss this over-hyped sideshow. Odium Restaurant is worth it to keep your VIP journey going- pricey yet upscale and hip. Parking is $15 in the garage if you get the museum to validate it, otherwise $25. Installations change regularly and the gift shop is funky.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jaywhitney2018
50,Awesome Place,"I have been there a couple of times. My 11 and 14 year old loved this place. We got bummed out because the mirror room was booked. After a few hours they made more openings and it made our outing much better. We took a bunch of cool pictures, after that we walked to Central Market for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gamezr1974
40,"Nice museum, and interesting area to visit","The building is super nice, the exposition was ok, and you can reserve your spot online, otherwise you may not be able to get in.And it is right next to the philarmonica, which you must see building, made by Gery.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danerias
50,There are interesting pieces of art,"(1) The parking fee is a little bit pricey.(2) The museum have different kinds of art pieces... some are really interesting (I like the big dining table and chairs the best) and (maybe I am not artistic) some looks like arts that anybody can create.(3) They have a room filled with lights which is really cool. You have to make a reservation beforehand to enter.(4) They have another room that you would need to pay to get in.(5) As with other museums, they have a lot ""not allowed"" rules, and they are not posted anywhere so be careful... (a) No food allowed inside; (b) No flash; (c) No selfie stick; (d) No touching the art; (e) No having picture close to the art -- they should put a rope around it so people would know how far they should stay away from the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HHM_JMS
30,Open?,"Didn't seem to be much happening at the time. Kind of unremarkable, like they weren't really open. Free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JFF34
40,Great museum with kids (9+),Free museum but you may have to wait 1+ hour but it's worth if you don't reserve in advance.We all liked the museum. I have 2 girls (9 and 15). It can take an hour to do but the infinite mirror room it's on appointment and it's about 2 hours after entering.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/damorin
50,Stunning,This museum is free so often there are queues so is best to pre reserve a ticket which you do the month before your visit.The buildings architecture itself has had mixed reviews but I simply love it and was most appreciative of the shaded canopy while queuing in the baking heat wave.There are a few mirrored installations that you have to queue for. One of which you have to have a ticket for that you should get immediately when you walk in. Again it is free.The spaces are nice and open and easy to walk around and full of interesting pieces particularly on the top floor.There is a free bag check facility and I spent about three hours there with about 40 minutes of queueing to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheIrishFella
50,Wow!,This was a super museum!!!We did not buy tickets online but got there at 10:30(on a Sunday) and waited maybe 15 minutes in line before getting in.Once in we immediately signed up for the Yayoi Kusama exhibit. We had a 3 hour wait for that so we went off and enjoyed the rest of the museum in a nice slow pace.My favorite room was the music room with all the videos of individuals singing and playing the same song. It’s mesmerizing.There are some other neat exhibits and a few that were weird and a few I cared less for but all in all it was a really nice time.My hubby loved exploring the buildings architecture through his camera.And my daughter finally introduced us to Yayoi Kusama as she has been wanting to for some time. Very interesting artist!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DianeRenee
50,Most amazing contemporary art museum!!!,"Been to a lot of contemporary art museums and this one is the winner, hands down. We didn't pre-buy our tickets so waited in line which was fine as the wait wasn't that long and after seeing the regular exhibit, realized we didn't need to see the special exhibit anyway. The art was fantastic, I was in the building less than a minute and was already mesmerized with what I saw. There are free tours periodically which we just happened to time right so that added greatly to what we saw. Highly recommend!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rduinc
50,Not worth a long wait,Grateful it was free but if I had to pay to get in I’d be bummed. Breezes thru in 18 minutes. The restrooms are ridiculously small....one sink? Come on.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/529sukij
50,Great hang out place,I wish they had more events though. It is easy to get to but make your reservations online beforehand,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tongotuesday
50,Excellent museum,"Beautiful museum with modern arts collections. We came in the afternoon and as we didnt have tickets, we queued for 30 minutes. Beautiful modern art collections and there were assistants that keep an eye of your activity, to ensure not touching the displays or posing too close etc. Thats for good intention I believe. Pity we didnt get to see the ground floor exhibition as the tickets were no more available. Be advised to book early by online on the First date every month.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arsu_12
40,BOOK TICKETS WEEKS IN ADVANCE TO AVOID LONG STANDBY LINE,"Book your tickets weeks in advance, so you won't have to wait in the Broad's long standby line. Usually, during the summer, the waiting line is 60+min in the sizzling LA heat. If you didn't book your tix in time, and you are thinking about waiting in line, make sure to follow the Broad's Twitter account - they post regular updates about how long it will take to get into the museum via the standby line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GreenLakeGirl1
30,"Big Yawn, A lot of Hype, Really Small","Sure there are some interesting exhibits, namely the Infinity Room. You will need to book in advance to see it and its a cool experience, its ok good if you want some instagram photos. The rest of the museum they will request a ticket to enter which you will reserve a month in advance online and they probably won't even ask for it at the door. Parking is easy but cost about $9 and admission is free. Its an ok contemporary museum, its small, its ok but nothing WOW in my eyes. I wouldn't make the effort to come here If I was here on vacation.If your coming here to see a show at the Disney Concert Hall across the street or MOCA, ok you can come check it out, but not worth the effort for a whole trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ashleysK4355MG
50,Amazing World-Class Modern Art Museum!,"This is a gem of world-class modern art. You should have reservation. The admission is FREE, but the crowds make it necessary to have a reservation system. There is a stand-by line for those without reservations, with an app that provides an estimate of wait time. I did the stand-by line no a Saturday at 10:30 AM and only a 20 minute wait. The FIRST thing to do when you enter is make a reservation for the Infinity Mirror room. Give them your cell number and they text you when you are at the front of the line. This exhibit is a must-see! You get 45 seconds inside the Infinity room and it is almost impossible to describe other than it is like floating among a million points of light!. The other exhibits are amazing,-- loved the gigantic table and chairs. Take some time and walk all the galleries, well worth any waiting in lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetotravel92630

50,Lovely collection,"My friend's friend suggested we visit the Broad when I was going to be in Los Angeles. I booked tickets April 1st for our day in May, choosing opening time (11am). We parked in the car park and almost immediately got our validation ticket. We entered the ""Advanced Tickets"" line about 25 minutes before the gallery opened, the first ones there. Ultimately, we were the first ones to enter the Infinity Mirrors.The art work upstairs is interesting, the collection is good...but it's very small. If I had waited for longer than an hour to enter the Infinity Rooms, I would have run out of art to look at.The washrooms were clean and the staff were really lovely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wherelolawent
50,Something for Everyone!,"The Broad has something for everyone to enjoy, young and old alike! I guess you would call it contempoary art but that does not quite describe how fun and unique this place is. It was great to see the children enjoying this place so much along side the adults. I really felt delighted by what I saw and uplifted! Definitely not a stuffy museum, a place for all ages to explore, enjoy and imagine!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LPinAZ
50,Best Part of the Trip,"Visiting The Broad was one of the highlights to our visit in Los Angeles. The architecture and set up of the exhibits were remarkable, and the art was relatable. The museum employees were phenomonal as they were knowledgeable about the art peices and artists. They got the visitors involved in the art and left their explanations open for our own interpretations. We will definitely return to The Broad to see future exhibitions.Note: We arrived at the museum later in the afternoon and all the spots for the Infinity Mirror room were taken. We returned to the sign up list right before museum closing and was able to snag a last minute cancellations. So don't give up on seeing the Infinity Mirror room!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kwelsh14
50,LA has become a cultural behemoth!,"No trip to Los Angeles is complete without a visit to at least two of the Big Six museums, one of which is The Broad (others include the Getty, Getty Villa, LACMA, Norton Simon and MOCA, which is just across the street from The Broad). The Broad is a contemporary space with highly stylistic and fresh design and a collection that is breathtaking in its breadth and audacity. And, like the Getty and Getty Villa, admission is FREE!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronaldwT5420YM
50,Vacation in Los Angeles,"One of the highlights of our visit to Los Angeles was to visit The Broad Art Museum. I highly recommend it to anyone who lives or visits Los Angeles. The museum has a display of very beautiful art pieces and collections. My teenage son was impressed with the display of won of his favorite artists, the late Andy Warhol. He stopped to take a few pictures of Mr. Warhol's paintings. We had to wait in line to enter the museum. It was definitely worth the wait and admission is free. The museum closes at 5pm.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacquelynu2015
40,Great museum,"The waiting line is about 30-40 minutes but one can avoid the line by booking a ticket online 10-15 days in advance. Fortunately, the entrance is free. Definitely worth the waiting time. Both the inside and outside of the museum is really interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/717armenk
50,Amazing art collection and building,"The Broad has everything that you would expect form a world class private collection museum. While I understand that this is the private collection of the Broad's I was sad to see that the audio app that accompanies the collection is quite substandard, the stops would simply not load and it was not very user friendly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/P2561APjuliom
30,Is this the real dismaland?,"There were (just) enough interesting works of art to merit the effort of organising a visit to the Broad, however I guess this is one for real art aficionado's. The general atmosphere seemed very somber and the works of art a bit detached. The Broad is free to visit and I would recommend booking online. If this is modern art at it's best then I'll have mine a little bit more traditional, please.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mibrah
50,Gorgeous museum,This museum is beautiful inside and out. The architecture is amazing. A bonus for anyone who gets museum-fatigue: it is definitely manageable to see everything here in less than a day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/THD
40,Fun modern art experience,"Definitely book your tickets online ahead of time! It's free, and we only had to wait in line about 10 minutes before we got to go in. The museum is very nice and well organized, and the building itself is an interesting piece of architecture. If you plan on bringing young people, I would recommend checking out the exhibits online ahead of time. A fair amount of it was explicit and not really appropriate for kids.The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and they were able to answer all the questions we had.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rachel_Marie_Be
50,Book ahead free online! Modern art,This museum is free but they only allow a certain amount of guests in per day and you need to reserve free tickets online at least a month before you plan on visiting Los Angeles.This museum contains modern art so be aware before coming. The art is wonderful. The natural light is magical and the staff are friendly and welcoming. The gift shop is small but the exhibitions are exciting. There is no restroom on the main floor so use the lobby bathroom prior to riding the escalator to the main showroom.Weekdays are significantly less crowded than fri-sat- sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpond
50,Fantastic a must see,We did not precook a ticket and waited in the standby line for about 45 minutes. It would certainly be busier on weekends so go early or later in the day.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/255060Charlie10
50,A Must See,"The Broad is a relatively new kid on the museum block in downtown L.A. Unless you plan ahead to get tickets (highly recommended), you may be standing in an endless line and unable to enter. The museum is free and it should be a top site for travelers. The architecture (both outside and the unusual interior escalator to the galleries) is stunning. The art work will be judged by individual preference, but there are some modern works that will appeal to all visitors. There are special exhibits and a sampling of major contemporary artists. Given the size of the museum and the controlled crowd access, you will not feel pressured to move along or crowded by others.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/555NotGreat
40,Nice free museum of modern art,"Liked most of the items in the Broad. Many large format paintings and other artwork. Some of the paintings were not interesting to me, but probably would be to art enthusiasts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/porter_osborne
50,Well worth the time !,So cool from the outside of the building to the exhibits ! Lots of great picture taking places . You don’t need tickets in advance but recommend getting them to save time . Park a block away for much cheaper parking even with the validation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lb33wonka
30,Ok,"The architecture is amazing. The rest is informational and ordinary. Staff is polite. Would not visit again. I would say you need about 2 to 3 hrs to see all and read. The main attraction was not available, due to no time openings.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TexasTravelertx
40,All modern art for 2 floors,"First it is only the 3rd and 1st floors. You will not spend a lot of time here, however it is well worth the time you do spend. The light show is pretty cool to see plus the large table and chairs. The 3rd floor is a lot of fun!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/421RickH
50,Buildings of Distinction...,"I've been coming to LA regularly for over 10 years and never been to this part before, where the Broad is situated. It's the civic centre, with a small-ish cluster of tall government buildings. It doesn't even feel like LA, more like a mini-Washington. The Broad sits next door to home of the LA Philharmonic. Both are modernist buildings that make a grand statement against the surrounding ornate architecture of LA officialdom. This is the naughty world of art versus the stern world of authority. But the whole collection isn't unbalanced. We can handle this stuff. We didn't have tickets for The Broad and on Twitter it warned of standing in line for at least an hour. We gave it a go and the line went very quickly. Less than 15 minutes. Inside The Broad is as good as the outside. If not better. This is wholly recommended. Come to The Broad. Just opposite - across the road - is an underground shopping centre with food outlets. It's great for people watching as the office workers go for lunch. The Broad and the whole of LA city is well worth a day trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/major_rawls
30,Strictly Modern Art & Only 2 Floors,"The main attraction for most visitors will be the playful ""pop"" art of Roy Lichtenstein & Jeff Koons. If your itinerary includes several locations within ""downtown"" L.A. then the relatively new Broad museum is a nice stop. However, it is questionable whether it should be your sole reason for taking the time & energy to venture downtown. The Broad (named & funded by real estate investor Eli Broad...rhymes with road) is strictly modern art and limited to only two floors (one of which is at times restricted as a special exhibit with a separate admission). The outside architecture is disappointing compared to the spectacular Disney Hall next door. Admission is free either by making advance reservations or waiting on line. Open late on certain days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/weRtheWorld2016
50,Killer Museum,"This museum houses an amazing collection of contemporary art in downtown LA. Not the largest place but, it is packed with great works!! You could spend one or five hours there depending on your interests. A must to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/coachee1313
50,A must-see for anyone!,Excellent museum for cool modern art. Fun for anyone. Lots of great photo opportunities. I would recommend putting your name in for the Kusama Infinity Mirrors before you go in to the museum as that had a two hour wait time but they text you when it's your turn. This was well worth it. Easily the best part of our L.A. trip.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lostj252
50,Amazing art museum,"The Broad has a world leading collection of modernist and post modernist art by iconic artists. The staff are friendly, charming, knowledgeable, individuals, some of them a bit quirky in a good way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/F7858QOmarkh
50,Not just for art fans,I very much enjoyed my trip to the Broad! I got lucky and only waited in line for about 45 minutes though would definitely recommend booking in advance if possible. There was a wide range of different contempary artists and there were a lot of recognisable pieces even for someone who doesn’t know a lot about art. The infinity rooms were amazing and were worth the wait . Would recommend for anyone looking for a free activity for an afternoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcanicash28
50,The Broad was an impressive museum,"Was great to take my 7 year old to a pop art exhibit. Upon arrival, I checked out rooms that were age appropriate. This was to ensure she did not feel left out though my husband and I could alternate coverage to enjoy ourselves.We were excited to see the Jeff Koon exhibit with Tulips, Balloon Dog and Michael Jackson/Bubbles sculpture. We all truly enjoy this type of whimsical art with bright colors and familiar images. Interesting that my daughter said it reminded her of Alice and Wonderland. Not sure why though felt it great to hear about the art from her eyes.Great museum, awesome art, and the famous INFINITY room. My only regret and it is on me - time to stay for the weekend family art workshop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/callines
40,Enjoyed our time,I got free tickets online in advance. We spent about an hour here. Very enjoyable. No comparison to places like MOMA but would still make plans to go. We did not have tickets for the featured artist section - should have included that.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ORCon
50,Book ahead,Or you will be stand-by. Great contemporary art gallery. The museum only allows so many in at a time so it is never over crowded.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HennessyWhite
50,Wonderful Exhibits,"I've always paid for the special exhibit (Jasper Johns, Cindy Sherman) -- which have always been wonderful -- and you can enter at a specific time. After, you can go up to 3rd floor to see the more permanent exhibits. Also be sure to walk down the stairs -- stop on the landings and see how the rest of his collection is stored. Most interesting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SGKCalifornia
50,Great Modern Art Museum,"Its one of the best I've seen. The collection is very well curated, very interesting pieces, and not overwhelming at all. I think its a must even for non modern art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/manuelhe
50,Nice gallery,Small galley full of innovative art that challenges. The art is nicely displayed and includes many significant modern pieces. The infinity room requires advance booking (on arrival) and a 2 hour wait but this is about the time you will to do the remainder of the gallery justice.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StevoHughes1
50,Worth a visit,We arrived in the middle of the afternoon so avoided the wait. The collection is interesting and we found that the guards were willing to engage in insightful conversations.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Clamflat
40,Contemporary Art,"Visited this museum on a Wednesday. Luckily, the queue at the entrance was not that long.The museum showcases contemporary and modern art.One highlight is the mirror room done by a japanese artist. But you have to have an online booking but free of charge.Wheelchair access available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ajiea2016
50,A distinctive Modern Art Museum in Los Angeles,"The Broad is a special collection of modern art across the street from MOCA and next to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. It is free to get in. You can sign up for tickets online if you have a few months ahead to visit. If you're from out of town, you can fall in line and wait the up to 3 hours to get into the museum. It is a wonderful collection of modern art worth seeing. The building is also beautiful from a design perspective and is congruent to the design of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. If you like modern art, you must come here. Parking is expensive in the building but if you go to Olive Street, there are parking lots that are much cheaper. There are also a few metered parking spots on Olive St off 2nd.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/paolola
40,Impressive collections,We stood in line not for long and enjoyed our visit into this iconic location very muchSonevwonderful exhibitsLong lines inside for special features,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Nalismiranda
50,Nice museum,Great contemporary museum with wonderful architecture. Parking is a bit steep and the collection plus special shows are well executed. Museum employs up to date technologies to aid the visitors such as text messaging you for your turn at special displays.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/semanticvision
50,A Trip to The Broad,"I am not the only one who is reminded of Melies’s, A Trip to The Moon, by the fabulous escalator rising from the floor to project us up through the eye-hole and into the museum above, am I? Or is it the colonoscopy sequence in Fantastic Voyage? Regardless, the artscape up above carries us on beyond, around and through. The collection of art works is wonderful – bright and varied and interesting. I particularly love the vast sweeping panoramas by a Japanese artist and the same thing in bottlecaps and stickers by a Caribbean artist. The side galleries are filled with delightful paintings and sculptures, too; some well-known, some that probably soon will be.The gallery space for special exhibits (Jasper Johns, now) is on the ground floor, the permanent collection is upstairs where the architecture illuminates everything wonderfully in natural light. Be sure to take the stairway down to exit. The central elevator is beautiful, but the stairs are part of the trip, the voyage, with windows into the vast storage archives along the way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JONH155
40,Great exhibits - get advanced tix,"We reserved for the Jasper Johns exhibit and walked right in- past the long lines of people waiting for space. It was our first visit and really enjoyed it. It would be nice to have a sophisticated Resturant...if there was one, we did t see it. Gift shop is small.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karendU3998WG
50,Thursday Afternoon Visit,Grabbed lunch at the market and popped in to see their exhibits. Enjoyed not only the work but the architectural marvel of the building. Normally a line to get in but our timing could not have been better. A must see!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TrailBlazer695514
40,Good modern collectiion,"We were able to get in uisng the free access--- it took about 45 minutes to get through the line. The free access does not get one access to the Jasper Johns exhibit, so we skipped that. The permanent collection at the Broad is amazingly .... uhhh... broad, and there are several noteworthy pieces here. The Basquiat paintings are quite striking and worth the wait just on there own. I would say that if you ahve a little cash, it's worth it to pay your way in and get a reservation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ordinarymind
50,Great Museum,"The Broad is an interesting building right next to the Disney building a Gery design.The museum has wonderful installations by contemporary American Artists such as Warhol, Jasper Johns and Jackson Pollack. There were also special exhibitions on this day, German art ( confronting as it eluded to the horrors of the war) and a light room. A Great two hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneywanda
50,Great museum!,"Located next door to the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Broad is a must stop if you like modern art and are in the Downtown L.A. neighborhood. The museum has pieces from legendary artists such was Warhol among others. The museum is two floors, and I highly recommend waiting in line downstairs to see the Infinity room, it’s so cool!Admission is free for standby, just give yourself time to stand in line and be patient. There’s a ton of parking options in the area, including street parking. I parked across from the Westin on a weekend and it was a $10 flat rate in a garage there. Definitely put this on your must stop list in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/miamitraveldude
50,Great for modern art,Fabulous collection of modern art. Well laid out and easy to see. Remarkable depth in the collection. Free entrance only pay parking. Well worth spending several hours walking and enjoying the paintings,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RuthC78
50,Greatest art museum for families with teenagers,My son is not a huge fun of art museums and The Broad changed all that. It is a great variety of styles in an awesome location with a bit of art genius for everyone. Have I mentioned is free ? and if you book on line the wait is zero... great museum at no cost ... does not get any better for all art fans alike.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mihais55
50,GO!,"Just a fabulous art museum - a visual feast for the eyes and remarkably curated - could live in this place - smart, whimsical, cutting edge - it's really the only Museum I have been inclined to enthuse over in years...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jwdinaspen
50,Wonderful building and show,"The Broad is a well designed and beautiful museum. The permanent collection is excellent with rooms dedicated to different artists like Lichtenstein, Francis , Jeff Koons and many more.The Special exhibit is Jasper Johns. What a special treat. I wouldn’t miss this one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W5819PBstevem
50,The Cheese Grater Building,The art collection isn't my favorite but I love the building. Definitely worth a visit. Don't miss the Infinity Mirror Room and stop by the gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NancyG483
40,Don't miss it,"The Broad is worth it. General admission to the Broad is free, but the ticket system is a bit complicated. In my opinion, the best thing to do is the get the reserve advance tickets, that way you can get in line before they open and get right in. (Advance tickets are made available on the first of each month for the following month. You just go online, pick the day and time next month that you want to go, and you're set.) Your other option is to get in the standby line (first-come, first-served).We got tickets for 11 am, because that's when they open. We lined up around 10:30, and we were in the first 10-20 people in the advance ticket line. At 11, they let us in and we were in the first of the museum's Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirror rooms within 10 minutes.On the third floor are the museum's main galleries. And they have a great collection of modern art, including pieces by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Jeff Koons. The building itself is a showstopper.Definitely worth a visit, but you'll have to plan ahead or wait in the stand-by line. Very cool LA experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alexisrachelletx
50,Must see - architecture & collections,"Great collection of post war to contemporary art from the 1950s to the present nested in a building designed by world-renowned architectural firm Diller Scofidio&Renfro. Closed on Mondays, admission is free, join the onsite standby line for first-come, first-served tickets (come early, we were not able to see the Kusama Infinity Mirror Room because of the crowd).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thePERSONALtraveler
40,I like it.,The building it self is a peace of art. Even it were empty I would advice to see it. Art was as in the good abstract traditions. Although no traditional set of impressionist mostly abstract and big pieces. Museum is free but you need to pay for special exhibit. I spent about 1 hour walking in the museum for free and liked it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oxanau
50,A MUST for modern art fans,"If you want to view the infinity rooms make sure to arrive early (or book early though the tickets go fast). You won’t be disappointed the staff knew from or position in the queue exactly when we would get in to the minute, which was incredible considering the length of the queue.The gallery is incredible, beautifully curated with exceptional art from Lichtenstein to Kusama, Koons to Murakami. They have created literature for both adults and children which is perfect when visiting as a family.Having been to many galleries across the globe this is without a doubt one of my favourites.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiannaS539
50,Amazing,The one minute in the light room is crazily good .We queued up at 9 am as didn’t pre book.On entry immediately went to get a slot got 11.40 amAlso your ticket allows next day entry tooReally unique,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarolWatt
50,Lots of fun,"We went without a reservation on Sunday early afternoon. We waited 30 minutes before being allowed entry, which is free. The museum is small and all that is needed is about an hour. The art was excellent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yannis63
50,Great art take in LA,"If you appreciate contemporary art, then definitely put The Broad on your list. Avoid the lines by getting tickets in advance. Because of its size, it's not overwhelming. Excellent exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/milesandmiles
30,Nice museum,"The Broad has a very nice collection of contemporary art and is just across the street from the Museum of Contemporary art, so you can visit both on one stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
50,Hip Hotel in Downtown LA,Downtown LA has really developed over the past decade and the Broad Museum is located right in the heart of this renaissance. Always interesting exhibition taking place at the Brad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stuarts813
50,Great smaller museum,"Definitely need to reserve tickets on advance to avoid long lines. If you do, it’s free! The space and the building are really interesting. Some of the works are on permanent display (like the Koons sculpture of Michael Jackson) and others rotate. They also offer at least one special exhibit on the entry level",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SaminDC
50,"Absolutely a fantastic modern art museum, and free!",Reservations are highly recommended to minimize wait times. The artwork is wonderful. Food and cocktails in the museum's restaurant were delicious.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DanielBeryl
50,Great collection. Jasper Johns exhibition worth going to. Building not so much.,"It is a pain that you have to book so far in advance to get into this place without having to stand in line for ever. But I guess its popularity is due to the fact that it is a great museum for contemporary art. The permanent collection is great. The Jasper Johns exhibition was great.The building is another matter. I read somewhere that the outside was designed to contrast with the Disney Center next door...which it does. But I'm not much of a fan for the ""envelope"" that surrounds the building. I guess the architectural problem is how to design a building that has to contain square rooms with vertical walls on which you can hang art works (the Guggenheim seems to have figured this out, although perhaps not optimally). I also don't like the interior of the building, or at least the lobby and the parts where you get to the art work...it makes me feel like I am inside a large intestine. But I have to say that the feature that lets you look into the areas where the art that is not on display is stored is pretty cool.Bottom line is that the collection is great. Who cares about the building?!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PrinceConsort
30,Free Museum,We decided to come visit this museum as we were told it was free. I think you can reserve ahead of time. We had to line up outside for about 40 minutes. Its more a modern museum. When you arrive make sure you put your name for line up to see the Infinity mirror. We got there late so we could only see the small infinity mirror upstairs. The downstairs one is much better- thats why I heard. I heard that you can go inside the infinity mirror. The upstairs one is not so great. So make sure you sign up early on the ipad just before the gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elnchan2
50,The MoMA of LA,"The Broad is so hot right now and it's not hard to see why. Top notch modern art and exhibits (including the current Jasper Johns show) make this place a feast for your eyes (pardon the cliche). I must warn you, the lines for this place, even if you pre-pay for tickets, are insane! I waited 35 minutes to get into the museum and I already had a ticket! It was also a weekday! The gift shop was a little disappointing considering the scale of the museum. I highly highly recommend this museum if you're in LA, it's worth waiting on the long lines!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arissalovesart
30,Not worth Parking cost,"While the cost of The Broad is free (love that) the parking is $15. The reason I have a problem with this is that the museum was so small we only spent 45 min there. Also, we arrived about and hour after opening and it would have been 4 hours, yes you read that right, 4 hours to wait for the special Infinity Room (I did NOT wait for that btw)!! Maybe if it wasn’t raining and we could have killed time somewhere else, it would have been worth it but it just felt like a waste.The art that was in the museum was pretty cool and I really loved some of the exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1Michellej925
40,Outstanding contemporary art museum in Downtown LA!,"Visiting The Broad was one of the highlights of my recent LA trip. The four hours there were really well spent. It is a contemporary art museum founded by philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad. What a gift to LA,not to speak to the countless visitors who get to see an amazing eclectic art collection free of cost! I reached early, around 1015 ( the museum opens at 11), to find a long line of visitors waiting in queue as standbys. I didn't mind at all---- while I stood in queue I took in the sunshine and read a wonderful informative brochure that the visitor associates distributed. Apart from the familiar iconic pieces like Warhol's Campbell Soup can paintings, there were some phenomenal treats like the huge mural by Takashi Murakami. I got to see Jeff Koon's Balloon Dog and Tulips which were delightful. Since it is a personal collection, it may not be completely inclusive of what is considered contemporary, but clearly this was a spectacular collection in its own right. The building which houses it is an architectural marvel too. All in all, a must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sarina14
50,Top Notch,The staff is great and the architecture and artwork make this a must for any LA trip. The special exhibits are extra and you need reservation so book a Friday to get a date because the weekends are usually sold out.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OntheroadCa
50,Beautiful museum,Make certain you put your name in the que upon entry for the Infinity Mirror Room. It is worth it. Also the special Johns exhibit may be the only opportunity you have to see all four of the Seasons paintings together.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/706amyk
50,Free. Really? Fabulous!,"Museums are rarely free, save for maybe one day a month, but when the benefactor is extremely wealthy and has an art collection worthy of creating a building to house it and open it to the public—for free—everyone benefits. The collection at The Broad (pronounced with a long o, not a soft o) is mostly modern pop art, some a bit on the edgy side, but wow, colorful, thought-provoking, and did I mention free to view? The deal is that you have to schedule your visit ahead of time. On this particular day, we didn’t do it online, but we waited in the stand-line. On The Broad website it tells you how long the current wait is, so we dashed over when the wait was 20-30 minutes. I know that sounds long, but the later it gets, people wait up to two hours. It was warm that day and thankfully the line was on the shady side of the building. But who’s kidding who, it was hot and there are no benches along the line. If you find yourself in that situation, bring water that you can drink in line because like a lot of places, you have to toss it if it is open before going in. People say Los Angeles is too expensive to visit. They just don’t look hard enough for the places worth visiting that are also free--like The Broad. I would definitely enjoy The Broad again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeMeDaVinci
40,Free Art Museum,"I went online & quickly secured a ticket for myself online. Even though it’s free to enter & see the third floor art, entrance is regulated via ticketing to keep it from becoming over crowded. Brilliant!You can also get in line to wait for last minute ticket openings but it looked like the lines were long every day. Save yourself time & go online to reserve a spot.They also have a rotating special exhibit that does require an entrance fee. It was Jasper Johns while I was there. I only had an hour to spare so I skipped the special exhibit and was totally satisfied with my experience.A great treat alone, on a date, or with family. Fantastic for all ages & fans of contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/975elizabethd
50,Excellent Musuem,A wonderful art museum with a nice permanent collection as well as interesting temporary exhibits. Amazing architecture and layout.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/World_Traveler_DR
50,The Broad Unique in Every Way,"The museum experience is about the edgy collection of contemporary art for sure; but the building and its lobby are part of the experience. The lobby transports you into a futuristic cave. In the stairwell there are windows revealing peaks into the back of house. The galleries are sleek, with natural diffused northern light from a network of skylights. Also fun, the security presence. Yes, security is different at Broad. The galleries are staffed by people well versed in the art and who are happy to engage in intelligent discussions. This is in the spirit of this thought evoking museum. It is engaging, fresh and will leave you inspired to think about the future of art. There is a fee for special exhibits, but general admission is free. Tickets must be reserved in advance, though there are limited daily walk-in tickets available, but you'll have to wait in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickeygreencherry
50,Love Love Love,"Everything about this museum is a different experience! The museography is amazing, I love Jeff koons and his classic ballon like art. I recommend to book in advanced so you don’t have to wait in line for a long time, also as soon as you’re inside the museum, take left and sign in for the yayoi kusuma exposition, and they will give you a specific time to go back to enter the expo, this way, you have time to see the museum while you wait to enter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sammieab
50,Amazing art collection,The Broad is a fantastic modern art museum in downtown. Their main collection on the top floor is fantastic. I love it because it's extensive but not overwhelming. Easily approached an enjoyed in 1-2 hours without feeling exhausted at the end. Nice mix of styles. I strongly recommend getting tickets in advance because the waitlist line to get in was really long when I went. It's free!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShannonW2274

40,Loved the Jasper Johns exhibit!,"This free museum (except for the special exhibits) is very modern in feel and has a nice selection of modern artwork. We were able to get tickets to the Jasper John’s exhibit and love the audio that accompanied the tickets. I really enjoyed getting to know the artist through his works. The museum also has a permanent collection and is easy to do in about an hour. My favorites are the pieces from Jeff Koons and Andy Warhol.Tip: Same day tickets can be had if you stand in line, however it’s best if you just sign up online and get the timed tickets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/renakashmere
50,Tip: Best time to visit if you have no reserved tickets.....,"This museum is one of the best places in Los Angeles which is free and delightful. I love this museum. We brought some visitors from out of town to visit, since it was a last minute thing, we did not reserve any tickets. I was hoping to line up outside and see if we could get in. We arrived around after three when they just closed off the waiting line and on a weekend, not too many visitors , we were allowed to walk in without any waiting, what a blessing! Its plenty of time to walk around since it closes at 5pm. Visitors were minimal and we could see the exhibition leisurely. One more tip, make sure you book your time to visit infinity room as soon as you enter the museum, ortherwise without reservation, you can't see the room which is also free. Not only that you could visit and take some pictures on Disney hall next door and walk the garden. Kill two birds in one stone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itcheetam
50,Great selection and staff,The staff was super nice and provided good tips on how to keep my 7-yrs old engaged. Make sure to book your time for the special lighting installation early on. We went during the Jasper Johns exhibition and it was great. We paid and it was worth for not standing in line. Beautiful building.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Flavia_travel
50,Great FREE Art Exhibit in DTLA - The second time around,"I had visited The Broad over the weekend. It is recommended to log onto the website and get tickets in advance. They offer FREE tickets 1 month in advance, which inevitably sell out. You can get a max of 9 FREE tickets. Parking is $15 with validation. Fairly easy.I think you can check their twitter feed to get a better idea of the wait line for non ticket holders. The wait list is hard and unpredictable.They have 2 sections, one is a paid area and the other is the free exhibit. The free exhibit doesn't seem to change all too often. I visited a couple years ago and most of the exhibit is the same. They rotate a few pieces. With that said, it is definitely worth a visit. The museum is kid friendly, but they are pretty strict about getting too close to the art and touching, which is understandable.Its a quick tour and early would be great or end of day, which leaves you time to do other things. We went for lunch right afterwards.Hope you enjoy this and like my review if it was helpful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chillin247365
50,Great private collection / Jasper Johns,"It is an amazing gift of art to the community!The exterior structure is only a hint of what inside holds. The Twombly’s are swoon worthy, the space is filled with little gems that are to good to miss. A must go to while in Los Angeles.The Jasper Johns was well worth the twenty five dollars. The most remarkable are the works in the artists private collection, see it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dustyNewtownSquare
50,"Supurb, a meander through contemporary art from the 20th century forward.","Splendid collection, both broad and deep, of contemporary art. Allow plenty of time. They save a percentage of admissions for walk-ins. Go without a reservation and you will get in (though you may not see the current ""special exhibit.""",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C2587VOstevenm
50,Perfect venue for a show,"Tis is an amazing place for a show. I have seen theater and vocal performers here. Love the space! There are cocktail and snacks available. Parking is on site. It is an elegant venue..the restrooms are lovely as well,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBrackett
50,Not only the must see museum in LA but also free ! Make it a day downtown LA ...,"Most fabulous museum to go to while in LA and worth exploring more of downtown ! While this is a free museum , you should get tickets when they go online the 1st of the month before ( 1st of January for the month of February ) If you are a last minute kind of person , you can just show up and wait in line ...they'll let people in as some people with tickets do not show up . Week ends can get really busy and you could wait over an hour but I found that on week days there were not that much in the afternoon as most people come right for the opening ...This museum is just as stunning outside than inside and the curators always make every exhibitions interesting. You can take a walk around and check out amazing other architectural buildings like the Disney Hall next door , walk to Grand Park and even stretch all the way to the Grand Central Market for a bite to eat with local flavors ....take Angel's flight cable car to get down there !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marikoknk
50,A must seen museum in LA,"If you like modern/contemporary art and architecture, you must visit the Broad in LA downtown. It has a variety of contemporary art collections, plus the most popular Infinity Room that only allows you to enter for 45 seconds. Both the exterior and the interior are beautifully designed, it made each art piece stands out while you stroll through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/xiaohongw2015
50,Get tickets in advance!,"We visited the museum during the last available slot and had enough time to see the jasper johns exhibit and museum.It was recommended and I agree to go to the special Exhibit 1st then to ask for the elevator to go upstairs to the top floor of the museum. The third floor is the only floor for viewing art besides the special exhibit downstairs. There are a few windows on the stairs on the way up and down from the 3rd floor that let you see into the art storage area, and that is definitely something to peak at.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gmanbumpy
40,Shield and great circulation systems.,The architecture of this museum is most interesting borrowing the shields that began in San Francisco and continued in Marseilles. The building automatically creates a fanciful architectural promenade that helps visitors discover the collection.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/W9269JDmichaelh
40,The Broad Boasts Contemporary Art Worth Seeing,"We had a wonderful afternoon at The Broad. I had been eagerly anticipating visiting this popular museum for quite a while. We were so happy to see the contemporary artwork (think Keith Haring and Jeff Koons) and The Broad currently boasts the Jasper Johns exhibit.Upon arrival, I didn't like having to wait outside for our appointment time to get into the Jasper Johns exhibit and then the rest of the museum. I'm glad we arrived just on time and not before as we had planned as it was a chilly day in LA. Odd, but true.I would recommend The Broad. It's easy (once you are inside) and manageable in a couple of hours. A pleasant addition to our town.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SoCalValleyGirl
30,Great building; disappointing collection,"The building is worth seeing and some of the art is good. But, the collection, as a whole, was very disappointing. I would recommend going to the museum if you can get your tickets in advance and want to see a spectacular building. But, don't expect to be wowed by the collection.Also, FYI, the museum does not have a cafeteria or a cafe.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jscottjoplin
50,Jasper Johns show,First time at this museum. Very cool space and pretty good parking close by. Very friendly people working there and well worth the visit. Their permanet is great mix of contemporary artist mainly from the pop era...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/670daveb670
50,"Modernist focus, great acquistions",Cheese grater design remarkably functional inside. Remember that you need reservations to enter. Big exhibitions have additional cost but include admission to the regular museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annkD2707TQ

50,Amazing!!,"This is probably one of the nicest art galleries I've ever been to. It was amazing! We loved the contemporary art that filled the third floor. I would recommend booking a FREE ticket in advance. I hear the standby lines can get quite long. We attended at night, and it was fantastic. A must see when you're in the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sloaner83
40,Modern Museum,The Broad is a fabulous modern building located in downtown Los Angeles. It houses the art collection of Eli Broad and the collection is generally modern in nature.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jnaggie
50,A must see and FREE! Don’t miss.,"Wish I would have made a reservation but we lucked out and only had a short wait. The Broads have an amazing art collection. Everything from the hidden message, political statements, and just simple fun. Totally worth the trip. And you can get a picture of the Walt Disney concert hall right next door.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jlor9082
40,AN ISLAND OF CULTURE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES.,"From the outside architecture to the beautiful interiors and excellent art on display, this is a destination for those that appreciate art (or not). It is amazing the collection that the Broad's have amassed and have put on display for all to enjoy. Get timed reservations online in advance to avoid long waits in line. This is definitely worth your time to plan a visit. If you found the review helpful, please tap the Thumbs Up tab below.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelAgentDave
50,Worth the trek Downtown,"Everything about this Gallery is worth visiting. The architecture is amazing, the internal layout is interesting, and the works are very impressive. We also visited the Jasper Johns exhibition which is also worth pre-booking tickets for as it is very extensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HannahMistral
40,"Worrh the Visit, but not the best of the museums","We enjoyed our visit here, but compared to other museums in the area wasn't totally wowed by this one. The architecture was wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wjacksond
40,Worth the wait in line,We hadn’t really planned on visiting inside. The building looked so attractive in pictures we had to get close by. We knew that if we would have the time this would be the one museum we would visit.When we got there and loved the outside we just stood in line that took more than 50 minutes! You have to book tickets in advance in order to get into the special exhibition.The regular exhibition was wonderful. We had lots of fun exploring it!It just turned out to be a tour shorter than the waiting time but we felt it was worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/meyravg
50,A quite extraordinary selection,"We had never heard of this place until we found ourselves walking past it and were enchanted by the architecture. Not only is the building very striking, but its influence extends for some way outside the walls ... the sidewalk is lined with weird grassy humps protruding through the concrete, and the pedestrian crossings at the nearby intersection are multi-coloured pieces of art in their own right.Access to the main display area on the second level is by escalator up what appears very strongly to be a stylised birth canal. No, really. Waiting at the top is one of Jeff Koons' Inflatables series, in this case a truly enormous set of stainless steel tulips.The range of art on display is as wide as it is bizarre. There truly is something for everybody here, including those who would normally dismiss all Modern Art.The quirkiness of the place is pervasive. For example, the staircases leading back down to street level pause on landings with picture windows which overlook the museum's main storage areas, giving glimpses of the thousands of pieces of artwork not currently on display.There is a queue for free access and our Los Angeleno friends tell us that it is frequently very long and slow-moving. On the day we strolled past we got lucky ... we only waited about 10 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/happyjacknicole
50,So worth the trip,"Beautiful museum with a plethora of eclectic art. Warhol, Lichtensteinn, Koons etc are all represented in this gorgeous museum. What took my experience to the next level was speaking to one of the staff on site regarding the Mark Tansey room. Aaliyah was well-educated on the art and artist and was so friendly. I truly enjoyed her interpretation and explanation of the pieces. Unfortunately I did not get to see the Infinity Room. The wait was 218 minutes. I signed up and we went for drinks at Otium. While we were there, I received a text saying we were able to go into the room (only about an hour after I signed up) so we missed it. Hopefully next time. I will be sure to stick around knowing the estimated wait time might not be totally accurate.Overall, this is a lovely experience and I would highly recommend it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannenavila
50,A wonderful free museum,"Located next to Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, the Broad host the art collection of Eli Broad. The building is modern. The art collection is astonishing with masterpieces of contemporary artists. Think Warhol, Koons, Murakami. And do not miss going inside the Mirror Room. There is usually a line to get in it. For 45 seconds you will be lost in a world reflecting lights in mirrors. It’s akin to floating in the sky. Absolutely wonderful. The good news is that this museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hanancha
50,Wonderful (and always free!),Incredible space and collections. We arrived without reservations (Wednesday) and only waited about 15 minutes for entry. Unfortunately the Jasper Johns show was not opened yet but still a fascinating and varied collection of art and sculpture. Don't miss the Walt Disney Music center across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VVThanx
50,Go even if you don't like modern art,"A fun museum. I'm not really into contemporary art I suppose, but this museum is so worth it. Such an eclectic and enjoyable collection and I hope to return. Be sure to stop on the one staircase to look through the ""behind the scenes"" window into their storage area - you can see part of the collection hanging in storage which is really neat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Provo8
50,Staggering,"In terms of contemporary art and architecture, this museum pushes well past conventional collections I have seen at other major museums. The architecture - which is occasionally flawed - is ambitious and boundary pushing. The art simply captures the almost the very best in so many contemporary areas, from Koons to Keifer to earlier standard bears such as Sam Francis. For Millennials and others, it is a selfie and Instagram paradise. Visitor fashion is also much on display. I spent time with only 3/4 of the offerings and it was pretty astounding. I'd like to be more critical and not be in such awe, but I am humbled by what has been accomplished here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/profits101
40,"Nice museum for kids, teenagers and adults.","This is a great museum for kids. You won't have to worry about the kids being noisy. Them touching things, or them getting board. The teenagers will enjoy it because, they can take lots of selfies and explore. Adults will enjoy it because there is so much content that only an adult would see. There is no cost for the museum you can order free tickets or stand it line and wait to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clamdiger2
50,Quintessential and famous modern art,"If you love modern art, pop surrealism, minimalism you should not miss the Broad. This is the most comprehensive collection under one roof.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seehoustonlosAngeles
50,Amazing,"My first experience to a museum in LA. Absolutely loved this experience and all of the artwork. We got put on the wait list for the Infinity Mirror Room, worth the 2.5 hour wait. One of my favorite memories from my first visit to downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristenl713
40,A visit to Broad Museum,Wonderful museum in down town LA. Went to see Infinity Mirror show by Yayoi Kusama. That was great show> Get your tickets before hand. There are always big lines.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srak91
40,DTLA Gem,"The Broad is nestled between the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art. Both and The Broad and the Concert Hall offer great exterior photo opportunities and the area is close to dining and Grand Central Market.The museum is beautifully curated in a modern and clean space. You can start at the top and work your way down through galleries. There are recognizable pieces from pop artists scattered throughout. I would recommend booking your FREE tickets online and visiting during a weekday afternoon if possible, to avoid larger crowds.The infinity mirror exhibit has been mostly removed, with a one room still available to experience. There is an option to sign up in advance for a spot in line. Again, if you go in the afternoon or near closing on a weekday, you may be able to nab a short wait time. You are given about 30 seconds in the room once you get through the queue.The Broad is a perfect place to visit while you explore DTLA. There is so much to see in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Adponce
50,A must do for art buffs,The Broad is simply stunning. It looks amazing from the outside and inside it's filled with a diverse collection of thought provoking and iconic works. The store has some very unique gift ideas too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sydneyshopgirl
30,Great attraction for a day date!,"My girlfriends and I attended the Broad while in LA for the day. This place would be a great ""day date"" location since the museum is free (however parking on weekends is not). If you could book entrance online prior to your trip I would recommend it so you do not have to wait in line; otherwise if you don't have pre-booked tickets you would have to wait in line to get in.We attempted to go into the infinity room, however the wait was 5 hours long; which we anticipated based on the day we went.. I would recommend attending on a weekday to attempt shorter wait time. All the art pieces are amazing and the range in variety definitely is a plus for all those who are not too interested in art or get bored easily.The only thing that was burdensome was the fact that there were staff members literally at every corner or at each art piece. Nothing against the museum or the staff; I completely understand why it is necessary to have workers at every corner to ensure no damages to the art pieces; however it was extremely awkward at times viewing some pieces with a staff member staring at you the whole time. Other than that, the museum itself is definitely worth checking out!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gthao01
50,Loved this museum!,We went about 2:00 in the afternoon with no advance tickets and walked right in. No waiting line. One great feature from the museum - you can go to their website and find a link for regular/hourly updates on how long you have to wait in line to get in as a standby. It worked great. Loved the architecture and found an interesting array of contemporary artists. I highly recommend a visit to this beautifully curated museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/houstontravelingfool
40,Awesome place but not worth standing in line for hours.,The infinity room was great wished I could've stayed longer in it (Only get 45 seconds). Huge gallery of art some stuff is a little weird and some stuff really interesting. Would recommend but isn't a must see.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/isiahb2018
50,unsual art pieces,"ParkingThere is parking lot and u can validate the ticket with the museum for up to 3hrs. But u still hv to pay after u validate, but less $. I was there about 2hrs, after validation, I paid $12.When u head out from parking lot, make sure to pay first (there is pay machine next to elevator). Insert the white ticket that says ""the broad"", then the yellow ticket that u validated, and pay. If you dun insert white ticket first, and insert yellow ticket, it will say invalidate ticket.Entrance / VisitIf u are facing the main entrance of the museum, the left line is for ppl who has ticket, who booked a month ahead, and the right line is for ppl that dun hv ticket. ( the wait can be up to 2 hrs )I recommend getting the ticket first online. It's FREE and less wait time. If u book 11:30am, be there early coz they will allow all the ppl that book at 11:30am to go in at the same time. Then once u go in, go to the left, and sign up for the infinity room. There is a iPad for registration and there should be a staff to help out if u hv questions. Leave ur name and phone number and they will text u the wait time. Mine was 95 min. 10min b4 your visit to the room, they will text u again so u can head down to level 1. The room is located pretty close to the gift shop. It's tiny and there is water inside for reflection. Make sure u stand as instructed and enjoy the moment. It's rilli AWSOMEEEEEE! Time flies when u r inside so make sure to think about ur pose ahead !Overall, I luv the experience there. Staff r nice and they try their best to let you enjoy the moment while protecting the projects.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CelinaLA
50,Don't miss it!,"I'm not the biggest fan of contemporary art, but I really enjoyed my visit to the Broad. Be sure to see the Kusama room. (Sign up for it as soon as you go into the museum.) There was no special exhibition she we were there, but there is lots to see in the permanent collection and the architecture is something to see in itself. A variety of artists & styles. We spent about an hour and a half there. You'd need more time if there was an exhibition. The standby line is often long, so book your (free) tickets online in advance and you won't have to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AYL038
50,Must see the infinity mirror room,"An amazing collection of contemporary art that is free to visit! Reserve your spot to go in the infinity mirror room as soon as you get there. Even though they said the wait was 3 hours when I claimed my spot, it really was only about 1.5 Download the app to get more info about the art, artists, and building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristing711
50,AMAZING EXHIBITIONS,A lot of modern contemporary art pieces are collected there. It changes throughout the years so always something new to see.Saw the infinity room there and was just in awe of how much fun that was. Was in standby line and waited 2 hours.The inside is very spacious well lit and very modern. Highly recommend visiting.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jessofmed
50,Great small museum in DTLA. Worth checking out.,"Get your ticket online, it's free. It also can save you an hour or two! Great artsy stuff, there's also a small theater upstairs where they screen a short film. It has the balloon dog, the metal tulips, the giant dining room table, the infinity room (might be seasonal) it's quick to see. Not the biggest museum but definitely worth checking out. Parking wise, if you stayed less than an hour, do not put the validation in. It will go from $10 to $15. There are neighboring museums so check those out as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Taesian
50,Great Visit,"Parking is easy under The Broad. It is so well planned when entering, that it is painless. Everyone is nice and knowledgeable inside. It has a wonderful collection and it was easy to see everything. Worth the visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mannkmm
50,Kusama - the Infinity Room,"The Broad is a small, relatively new museum in downtown Los Angeles. The recent Kusama Infinity Room exhibit was a fun outing. Fascinating artist, mirrored rooms and soft sculpture art. The third floor housed Haring, Koons, Basquiat and Lichtenstein among others. Try the rotating sushi bar at Kura for a fun lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danalbonda
50,A work of art,I loved my visit to the Broad. It is an architectural gem in Downtown LA that should be seen if you only visit one museum during your visit. It’s compact in scale and free to enter (but book your space in advance online). The modern architecture is an experience in itself but the museum also contains an amazing collection of mid century to contemplate art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/32robd
50,IMPRESSIVE!!!,"I'm not the biggest contemporary art fan. Sometimes I think my 8yr old nephew can do a better job compared to some pieces of ""art"" I've seen, but the Broad is quite impressive! I understand the draw with a long line to enter. Luckily we got advanced tickets to enter during a specified time slot which I highly recommend doing. We parked in their garage and had our ticket validated prior to leaving. The exhibits are on the top floor with quite a large number of rooms. The venue had such amazing pieces of art and I thoroughly enjoyed all of it! This is definitely a MUST SEE & I HIGHLY recommend going!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BrianP634

50,Small but well-appointed modern &contemporary art museum; reservations a must!,"This art museum is well-worth a visit, showing mostly contemporary American artists. Having read a lot about the artists that were there, it was quite exciting to see their works ""in person"" for the first time.The museum is free but the reservation process is exacting: Reservations are accepted beginning on the first of the month of the month before the month you plan to go. As I was only to be in LA for a few days at the end of December, I was on my computer at exactly 11:00 am PST (9 hours difference from home) on Nov 1st, which allowed me to choose my date and time. On the other hand, it was impossible to get a reservation for the temporary exhibit, even following the even stricter, more complicated process to the letter. Check the site on how to get reservations and make sure you are on your computer when reservations open for your hoped-for visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msdAmerInParis
50,"Excellent collection, free entrance reserving through the site",We had some luck with the free tickets on short term availability. Possible due to bad weather the day before but i believe they run out pretty quick.Standing in line we were informed about the collection and some house rules.Staff was very friendly.Bagdrop right at the entrance.Shop sells earphones for audiotour.Collection was good and modern. We loved the infinity room and the Koons works.Good museum for about 2 hours.Would come here again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JerryO81
50,Free activity...Free!,This is a free admission however be prepared to stand in line. The museum is laid out in a modern fashion and it’s a great place to bring the entire family. It’s fun for all and the modern art expands the mind’s horizons. Parking garage close by and lots of great eating all around.Enjoy one of the only free events is this part of town.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1001vis
10,Free entrance creates long queue nightmare,"We made a last minute decision to visit LA in December and really wanted to go to The Broad. The museum releases the tickets on the first day of the month for the following month on their website, and the next available date is in Jan 2018. Which means we have to go to the museum itself to queue for their daily limited free tickets.Now, all we wanted was to go to the Broad Museum's permanent collection, but because Kusama's Infinity Room was drawing to a close, there was a frenzy crowd trying to score The Broad's tickets to get in to buy tickets for Infinity Room. Museum staff said the queue for the free entrance tickets was already bad but it was a double whammy now, as everyone wants to go into Kusama's Infinity Room.We queued for 3.5 hours to get into the museum on the 3rd floor. It is a nightmare and a waste of time. We wished we left, but because we drove an hour into LA, and parking fee cost USD15, we stayed and continued queueing.Is the permanent collection on the 3rd floor worth the queue? No. No. No. The queue and the crowd soured our experience. Plus, there are a lot of people interested in taking selfies of themselves only.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hviv
30,See and compare it to others,"A monument to a wealthy mans ego. Not the Getty or a Guggenhiem. Still an architectural must see. Modern art, not classics. Grand Boulevard is coming to life with this addition next to the Disney. Best of all, its ""free"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jamesv8
40,Funky meets fine art in LA,A rainy day in LA sent us indoors - “ it never rains in California “? (NOT)The Broad was on our list of must sees and it did not disappoint. An excellent collection of contemporary artists displayed in a clear open high ceiling environment in a building that is itself “fine art” .Reserve ahead for the special exhibits but do not avoid this museum if they are booked - worth a few hours of your day while in LA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AHG88
50,Excellent Contemporary art!,"It's unbelievable that the admission is free for such a wonderful collection of contemporary art! However, there is a fee to see the special exhibitions cost. I went on a Sunday morning and the place was packed. It's a gem of a museum. LA doesn't disappoint with their museums. The lines were long - I waited at least 2 hours to get in but it was totally worth it. Work by well known contemporary artists such as Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat as well as artists not well known in both 2D and 3D art. The staff were great on answering questions and monitoring the long lines. If you love contemporary art, you will NOT be disappointed even with the long wait to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Klassyhk

40,Contemporary Art,"The museum is of medium size. Easy to navigate as the special exhibit is on the first floor and the ""art"" is on the 3rd floor. Can easily take in this museum in a few hours or less. I mainly went to see the Infinity mirror exhibit, which was stellar. The rest of the art was just ok to me, but I am not much of a Contemporary art fan. I think it is worth seeing and walking around, especially as you can make an afternoon of it by going to The Broad and then to the Grand Central Market to eat.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/benkS4864RP
50,Tremendous Art Museum for Kids and Adults Downtown LA,"The Broad experience begins from the outside, with a perfect building right next door to the amazing Disney Hall downtown. The oculus breaks what could be a monotonous outside. Get your free tickets online in advance so you do not need to wait in line. No special exhibits when we were there so it was just the third floor permanent exhibits.. Once up the escalator you enter the well lit, cavernous third floor, broken into rooms but all walls do not reach the ceiling so the pattern of natural light is magnificent. Modern/contemporary art is not really my thing, but this is a good representative collection well displayed. Great place to take kids for an introduction to art. Great online free app with lots of information. It is not an all day project, as you can see it in under an hour and appreciate it in under two.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11douglast
50,We love this place,We went to The Broad to see the Yayoi Kusama exhibit. It was awesome. They had a permanent infinity room by Kusama that is amazing. I never tire seeing it.

30,Modern art,"Some of the art is better than the other. At least they didn’t have human excrement as part of the exhibit, as we have seen at some other modern art exhibits. Only a golden urinal. There are some works by Andy Warhol. The best part is the building itself. Interesting design, and the lighting makes it even more so in the evening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BK122
50,Amazing Contemporary Art Collection!,"Love the building, love how you enter, love the galleries and most of all love the art collection. They have an amazing collection of contemporary art beautifully displayed",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mundosully
50,The Broad - That’s all you need to say,"We drove to LA for the day to visit the Broad Museum. Unfortunately we did not have tickets for the special exhibit of Yayoi Kusama: infinity mirrors.The lobby was full of an art piece, love transformed into dots m, which were large pink polka dotted balls. It was a fun start to the day.While the museum has three levels, only level 3 is the actual galleries which have rotating works of art. The first thing that hits your eye is the Jeff Koons tulips, large colored mirrored works which are fun to stand in front of and see your reflection. I have always been a fan of Jeff Koons.Right behind the tulips is Takashi Murakam painting, in the land of the dead, stepping on the tale of a rainbow. This amazing work is the longest artwork in the collection, measuring 82 feet long.The exhibit was full of modern art from all over the world. It is designed in such a way that there are 21 small galleries and it is easy to make your way from one to the other without missing any.The first level has the special exhibits, and the gift shop, which is small but full of fun stuff.While most people take the escalator up from the 1st to 3rd levels, if you’re able to, walk down the stairs in the middle of the museum as they will take you past the storage area and you get to see other paintings hanging waiting for their turn to be shown.You can download the mobile app and audio tour, but you better have headphones to hear it. Otherwise you can buy some in the gift shop, to add to your collection of headphones.All in all a fun day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sa-i44
50,Not what I expected...very awesome,"Located near the center of the city, had seen photos of the building and heard how hard it was to get into. We did not book, and arrived around midday (end November - off peak). Spent about half an hour in a queue looking to get in. When we finally made it, very impressive. Modern art, but impressive modern art with collections from around the grove. Took about an hour to go through. Great for teenagers, particularly if they study art. Free to get in - thanks LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlistairMaccer
50,Amazing contemporary collection,"Breathtaking collection in an outstanding location. This is the one place to go if only one museum could be visited.It takes a while to get in, for free. Check and book advance tickets on line to avoid the queue.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yobinounet
50,a lot of non-gray,What is marvelous about the Broad is that most of the visitors are not gray-hairs (like my wife and me). I would say that the average visitor is in their mid-thirties. We took our grandsons there earlier this year. They are 6 and 8. They loved it (we of course kept them away from that one room). The art is what you might call accessible modern. The Broad is absolutely the best thing is downtown LA. It's hard to get a ticket.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/162deanm
50,The rare vanity museum that is a must-visit,"Eli and Edythe Broad have long been patrons of the arts and other causes in Los Angeles, and the relatively new Broad (rhymes with ""Road"") Museum houses their amazing collection of current art. They are clearly patrons of the highest caliber and collectors of impeccable taste. From Warhol to Basquiat to Koons to unknown and remarkable artists, it presents the Broads' amazing collection in a purpose-built structure that is a work of art itself. Admission is free, but you must book, and those can be hard to obtain. It's worth the effort, though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jonathantA7224YX
50,The Broad Museum,"This is an absolute no-brainer. Every visitor to LA should visit the Broad if they can. I was last there 12-20-17 for a special exhibition (Yayoi Kasuma - very special show, moving on to Toronto and Cleveland in 2018), but happily visited the excellent regular collection while there. So many iconic modern works. Come. You won't be disappointed. (Schedule tickets in advance if you can, though, otherwise you may need to wait to get in, even on a weekday.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B7037ZAjohng
40,Free general admission,"My sister and I had to wait in line for one and half hours! It was cold. I understand it is free but we could see the helping people were careless. When we got finally in we were so exhausted that could not pay attention to the details. I gave 4 just simply for the building, architecture and art. The one star less for being 1 1/2 hours in the line. They could manage better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hello2you_10
30,"Cool building, exhibits not for me","The building itself is very cool. The art exhibits are not what I enjoy. I went once, and that was enough. No need to go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msa23_2000
30,Permanent collection is really just art by the acreage.,"The lineup for the Kusama temporary exhibit was just too long, but I did get a chance to spend a couple of hours touring the permanent collection.I really couldn't fathom why Eli Broad would collect pieces of art that were all so gargantuan. It really seemed to me IMHO that he was buying art by the acreage to wow and impress rather than acquiring more important and reasonably sized pieces.Based on the buzz of the Kusama exhibit, I would definitely suggest a visit as it is one of only four venues in N. America to have the privilege of displaying it. However I would not encourage folks to go out of their way to see the permanent collection, especially since the Getty, MOCA, and LACMA are all nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Waterloonie
50,Loved movie night,Enjoyed the off beat movies the night we attended. Viewing the Narsisister shorts was quite an experience. The mirror room was also worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mark156
50,Great Culture in LA,A day of culture for the family. Child 1 is an art student at uni so knew some of the artists which was great to see. Fantastic exhibition. Something for everyone,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SherylW924
50,Great Collection as well as Kusama,"I’ve visited the Broad twice and both times was able to see the Kusama infinity mirrors. The permanent collection is amazing if you like contemporary art and the building is fantastic. The Kusama show was not as extensive as in Tokyo’s National Gallery this past spring, but the infinity mirrors were amazing. The only complaint is the short amount of time you are allocated to see them but is certainly understandable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterKenn
20,Takeover from Instagram,"While art should be accessible to the masses, it also should be respected. Unfortunately, with free admission, the masses pour in not to enjoy the work, rather to model for instagram. The noise echoes off the concrete floors and the amateur models stand in front of sculptures as an accent to their physique.If you want to enjoy art, walk to the other side of the street to the MOCA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomguzow
50,The Broad - Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors,"This review is about The Broad, in specific to the Infinity Mirrors exhibit by Yayoi Kusama. It was AMAZING! We went on opening day (there was a huge line, only downside if I had to pick one was waiting for each exhibit)Overall it was a great experience for my girlfriend and I. The exhibits ranged from Infinity exhibits & installations to paintings and photo. Each Infinity exhibit is timed for fairness and to prevent groups from setting up photoshoots. Other exhibits are not timed and you're allowed to take photos and what not.Would definitely recommend! Not just the exhibit but The Broad in specific!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sswayy
10,"Nothing to feel here, better pick something else","I came here hoping to experience something. Feel something. The land of Hollywood, Disneyland, etc.. I was expecting something goofy, uplifting, interesting... I was expecting to be moved in some way.The 'art' here is very fixed, boring, non-interesting, soul-less, heart-less, I didn't feel absolutely anything. The more I walked around hoping that this is all some misunderstanding - why would anyone want to show off this? I do sound like a snob, but the thing is I don't even go to museums often. And sometime I don't like them, but at least I feel the artist wanted to express something. In this case, consider it as a perfect, magazine you bought in the store... Nothing personal, everything 'perfect', nothing moving, nothing coming from the heart. I felt desperate to feel something, so I was left with only my desperation. Alright, getting too poetic now, that's it!Try Getty museum instead - even if you don't like any of the shows (there's many) you will love the scenery and the view! It's also free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kresimirc2017
50,"Yayoi Kusama Exhibit was great, but so was the permanent collection","We stood in line for hours for the special Kusama exhibit. It was worth the wait, but for those who don't like waiting, the permanent collection is really great, and admission is free. The building is an architectural gem.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charleswX5558FN
50,Enjoyable Afternoon in a Modern Art Wonderland,"A friend and I visited The Broad, and it was a great experience. We went in the early afternoon, so we had to wait in line for about an hour to get in. The time passed quickly, but if you don't get there when it opens, or at an off-time, bring a book, or better yet, a friend with whom you'd like to talk. It was a sunny day, but we were mostly in shade when we stood in line, but there were some volunteers handing out loaner umbrellas to those people in line who were in the sun.I really enjoy looking at art, but often don't like museums. I can be overwhelmed by a museum like NYC's Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, because it's so large and has such a diverse collection. Plus, some museums can be stuffy (I'm talking air quality, not attitude) and uncomfortable. The Broad seemed to be just the right size for me (not too much, not too little) and felt fresh (again, air quality and light), so I didn't feel like I was boxed in for most of a day. I also particularly enjoyed the windows in the main stairwell that allowed you to see the infrastructure/storage ""innards"" of the museum.There were many works from modern art's most well-known artists: Warhol, Rauschenberg, Lichtenstein, Kruger (Barbara Kruger can not be celebrated enough for my taste!), Koons, etc., but I very much enjoyed seeing works from Malcolm Morley, Mark Tansey, Kara Walker, Mike Kelley, and especially Tauba Auerbach. I had unknowingly wandered into an exhibition of Auerbach's work in NYC a while ago, and fell hard for her lyrically mathematical style, so I was particularly delighted to see something of hers at The Broad.The Broad is free to all, but I did spend a lot in the gift shop. Be prepared to be inspired to spend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alison_Wonderband
40,Nice Art work,This museum is pretty trendy and offers nice art work. I was a little bummed that we weren't able to see the lights exhibit as you have to reserve those tickets in advance (which I knew). I thought that maybe we could get lucky and get in the day of but they were sold out for the entire exhibit. You can see this entire museum in under an hour as it's not very large.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Glamris
30,"Reserve a month ahead for your visit, online. Don't get caught in the crazy lines!","This museum is all about the online reservations. Had I planned way ahead, I would’ve reserved tickets to the museum (if not the exhibit) in October. But I didn’t, and clearly, that didn’t stop me. I was determined to see the exhibit and museum. A tall order, I now know that.So, we went and stood in the stand-by line like the rest of the impromptu folks – also known as the last-minute, spontaneous, hopeful, museum visitors-turned-wait-experts.I did plenty of research online before going, but it was difficult to determine what the lines would be like. Previous museum goers warned that lines would most likely be longer over the holidays and weekends, but I wished and hoped and prayed most people would be Black Friday shopping. (Damn you, Amazon. No one in L.A. was Black Friday shopping because they were all in line for The Broad.)My mom and I showed up at 8:45am. We were able to easily park in the lot in the building – most of the parking is tandem so you’ll have to leave your keys with the parking attendant if you’re blocking someone.Parking is $22 but you get $10 off if you get your ticket validated. I paid the full $22 because my validation ticket didn’t work.Paying the full $22 was the grand finale to a very full day in line, after waiting for almost four hours. That’s right! One, two, three, four… I’m still in line.We went because we wanted to see Yoyoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Room, which looked beautiful and worthy of a selfie while in the exhibit, but definitely not worth waiting in line for four hours. Periodically, a Broad staffer would come out, and do a count of the stand-by line. They’d come out in pairs, and this would cause people to straighten up and pay attention, as if somehow their mere presence would magically move the line faster.The line was going around the block, and I’m guessing there were probably 350 people ahead of us. When we were finally almost at the front, one of the museum staff members came out to let us know they had run out of tickets for the exhibit. The woman behind me went ballistic, asking why they waited so long to give the final count and there better be a freaking manager she could speak with. I should also mention that it was around 1pm by this time, and for the lucky last people who managed to get tickets were asked to come back for their “appointment” to see the exhibit at 6pm. A whole five hours later! But people didn’t even blink. They just eagerly nodded and handed over a credit card to pay the $30 entrance fee for the exhibit, which is going away after Jan. 1, 2018.We got tickets and then… we were directed to stand in another line so that we could enter the building. Only in L.A., people!Now that my expectations were tainted with the 240 minutes I had spent in line, my judgement of the artwork was extra critical. I won’t lie, I was still excited to go inside. It was mostly modern art, and there were a few cool things, like the giant table and chairs, and a huge mural created by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami.The museum is really small. You could quickly go through it in about 20 minutes. I think we purposely stayed an extra half hour just shuffling around to somehow justify all that time we spent in line.Also, the line was shaded because it was nestled between the side of the museum and the Walt Disney Concert Hall across the street. Only the front of the line was sunny, but they provided umbrellas for (Asian) patrons to avoid the harsh L.A. sunshine. So, it wasn’t like we were sweating in line for four hours. Had that been the case, this would’ve been a very different story.PS - Even if you reserve tickets online, you still have to wait in a separate line to get in. It's faster than the stand by line though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q2196QMclairet
50,Great Museum,"The Broad is a grand new museum. They have a great permanent collection and they bring in excellent large scale single artist exhibits.The exterior architecture is nice but the interior design is awesome. Go up to the top floor and study the lighting and how it enters the structure. You will be amazed.At least now, in these early days, the lines are long. This, even if you have reservations. And, by the way, you MUST pre-buy your tickets and have reservations or you may wait in line a very long time.Do you want to know a secret? If you have a reservation you will still have to stand in line. Get there ten or fifteen minutes after your reservation and you can walk right in.Overall great place to see great art! Recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/applezen
50,Stunning Building. Amazing Art Work!,"The Broad is so experiential and contemporary! Set next door to the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Broad is one of the most beautiful buildings ever. Their stunning art collection with Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Andy Warhol and other amazing artists is just amazing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kanzulf2016
50,Outstanding temporary exhibit,"The Infinity Exhibit is supposedly a harder ticket to get than tickets to Hamilton --- it is quite unusual (unique really) but not something one needs to ""kill"" to see. That is, it is a powerful experience but if you miss it you won't be ""bereft.""The museum itself is housed in a gorgeous building and if modern art is your cup of tea, please go! The parking lot is well staffed (as is the museum itself) but the self-pay machine is totally confusing if you have obtained a validation while visiting the museum -- drove me crazy until a staff member came by to help.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trup
50,Fun and Free!,The art starts outside with the humorous and inspired grass nodes pushing up through cement envelopes. Love this free treasure trove of contemporary art so generously shared with us all by the Broads!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cindy20142014

50,Incredible Contemporary Art collection!,"The Broad has amazing contemporary art housed in an amazing contemporary, purpose-built building. I loved it even though I am not normally a fan of contemporary art. Admission is free but you must book tickets well in advance. Across the street from the Museum of Contemporary Art. Make a day of it an visit both. You won't be sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Eric22754
40,If u love art u will love this place,I went with my husband he wanted to go so badly admission is FREE & parking is. $8 if u get it validated by the museum on your way out. We parked behind/under the museum.He loved it I didn’t really like it I thought it was boring but that is because I don’t really like art. The one cool thing I saw was the life size dining table pretty cool!I’d recommend if you love art or want to spend a very cheap day out in LA. Don’t forget to book your tickets ahead of time they get full fast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alclarke96
50,Breathtaking,Great exhibits. Free. Worth the visit if you’re true lover of art. Located downtown across from The Colburn School. Remember to get a parking validation for the garage parking discount.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/iCryssy
50,So many classics I never expected to see in person!,"An amazing collection to see in person if you enjoy modern art. On display at the moment are famous works by Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Basquiat, Cy Twombly and many others. Many you'll immediately recognize and accept as art, and a few may have you scratching your head, but it's intellectually enjoyable to be confronted with the question: What's art?Advance bookings are highly recommended, and in fact 100% neccessary to see the special exhibition on the first floor and get more or less instant access to the free collection on the 3rd floor. I speak from experience: I was one of the dolts who didn't book in advance and stood in line outside for over an hour to get one of those free admissions.Lines form early so if you avoid my advice, plan accordingly.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UnrepentantFoodie
50,Enjoyed This Museum!,"The third floor of this museum is ""free"" but you must book tickets in advance. The pieces are arranged nicely and spread out so you can enjoy each room but do not feel overwhelmed with ""art"" everywhere. Plus the exhibit cards are well written and the staff is very knowledgeable if you have a question, which is unusual in museums!The Mirror exhibit is amazing. In the morning we noticed the line was extremely long but when we walked by in the late afternoon no line at all and we were able to get tickets for a time slot an hour later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/onthegoTwainHarte

20,Hugely Disappointed,"We went here purely for the infinity mirror which I thought was very cool, we got free tickets in advance, got there in time and straight in the queue and ended up going to see the mirror room after about 20 minutes which i was fine with as I understand everyone wants to see it. It's a shame you cant spend longer in there but it makes it fair for everyone.Other than that I thought the museum was very poor, I understand different people have different views on art, but there was a brush painted gold that i could do in my back yard. There was other random objects that were just very poor. One or two cool things like the balloon sculptures but not a lot that did it for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seanoldinho

50,Absolutely Stunning Structure,In the heart of downtown Los Angeles close to the Disney Music Center and close to other downtown attractions- Interesting exhibuts but reservations required.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sworrels
30,"Small, overhyped, not Art","I decided to check out this museum based on all the hype and marketing. Well, having seen the best museums in the world, I was far from impressed by this one. While the building is very interesting from the outside, inside it's very small, sparsely displaying ""art"" pieces that are super modern and can be hardly described as ""art"" (junk stitched together, magazine clippings glued together, neon sign etc).Additionally, you have to get free tickets months in advance, stand in line among a bunch of teenagers, and once inside try not to lose your patience among the same hordes of teenagers taking selfies.The special exhibit may be worth a visit, however on the day it showed 7+ hrs waiting time. Are you kidding me? They make you log on an ipad as soon as you get in, and it will tell you how long of a wait there is for the special exhibit. Everyone must have decided to skip it and go home, because those 7+ hrs turned into 2 hrs, so I decided to go back and have a look at the ""Infinity Mirrors"". You have to stand in line again, until you enter this room (one person at a time), and you can be inside for a maximum of x seconds, until the museum attendant opens the door again telling you to come out. Now, nice mirrors and unique concept for sure (better than the junk stitched together), but had I waited 7+ hrs just to be in a room for x seconds, I would have been pretty upset.All in all, a pretty disappointing experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kk018
40,Interesting building and interesting artwork,"The Broad as a contemporary art museum, the building is just as interesting as their art collections. I feel the structure is the collection of eyes together to see through art and the world. I recommend to join some guided tours when visiting the museum. You will learn the life of those artists and understand more their artwork.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jenny201110
50,Totally worth planning ahead to reserve a free ticket,"Yes, the ticket even for the general admission ( let's not even talk about the tickets for special exhibit)is hard to score. The reward is you get to view some delightful modern art in a well design , interesting space. Small enough that you can walk around without walking the marathon distance.You just need to reserve online the second the advanced tickets become available ( see website for current policy). You can try same day standby. The lines are long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724sc

20,It would have been nice but..,The problem with this museum is that is so famous and good that all the people from all over the world want to go there.The ticket is free and this is a nice thing but bring a lot of people also that are not interested to go there just because is free.They have few spot for people that want reserve in advance the entrance and a long queue for first come first served (line time 3 h when I was there).There is not a way to pay to get there without queuing! I wanted to pay so badly to avoid 3 h of the line under the hot sun.But the Museum was nice at the end.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheGirlOfTerezKorut
40,Worth a visit even if you do not go in........,The building is beautiful and whimsical from the outside. Walk around it.On the plaza to the south of the museum are fifteen 100 year old Barouni olive trees that were transplanted from northern California. If you ask the guards they will lie and tell you they were transplanted from Italy. Walk through the grove and sit down for a spell and ponder the accomplishment of what they did here. It is perfect.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/differentname

50,Short and sweet,"This museum is on the smaller side, sure - you can wrap it up in about 2 hours (and stay a bit if you want to see the traveling exhibit). With that being said, the collection of modern art is really inspiring. Had a wonderful time, so glad I made reservations ahead of time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NameisAlreadyTaken02

30,Cool art museum with some interesting pieces but limited display,"Went here with the family to see a special exhibit and went through the whole museum. We went specifically to see YayoiKusama Infinity Mirrors. To see this you need to get a separate ticket with a time on it and then come back at that time to line up to see this. It worked well and since my wife is good at managing this sort of thing we had it all arranged. As soon as possible I took off with the kids to explore the museum. I enjoy seeing things like this with the kids as they have a very fresh approach. The museum is cool and the pieces on display are interesting but to be honest we were done in about an hour and then after our 1 minute in the special exhibit our total visit was not very long. I am assuming that they have a limited display area and a lot more works on storage but I felt a bit let down by the limited amount of art on display. I was also a bit let down by the trendiness of the art. I know that the collection is what it is but felt that people were there to see a couple works by some famous modern artists and take selfies with them and that was the depth of the experience. I did appreciate some of the docents in the rooms who took a moment to talk with us as provide a small insight. My kids while not big museum fans do get art and do talk about it so they could have benefited from more curation. Funnily, they didn't get some of the more famous works and enjoyed some of the more obscure ones a bit more. Worth going to but don't expect more than a couple hours here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DaQi

Queues are long and admission on arrival not certain. They were kind enough to accommodate us on a two day notice ! And what a treasure of contemporary art was there to behold ! The ongoing exhibition of Infinity itself , was worth the visit. Do go there !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/212manju
30,Mixed bag of contemporary art,"Collection that shows the personal choices of a Los Angeles couple - often consists of the must-haves of what was hot in New York from the 60s on. The result is a mixed bag. The building is new and entry free, although often with a long line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traveledfordecades
50,Awesome location and great special events,The Broad is a wonderful new museum. Better to get the special tickets when shows are there or - if you are a non-local you might not get in. The owner has a fab collection which you get to see a part of. And the location is really fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jacksbat3
50,To Infinity and Beyond,"The Broad is a small museum, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in beauty, architecture, and a long wait to get in!I jest a little, but be prepared for a long line if you're waiting standby. There are tickets, but you must reserve in advance. We waited about 45 mins in standby with a toddler in a stroller. I would bring a bottle of water if you have to wait. The museum took us about an hour to view. By the time we viewed the museum, our tickets for the infinity room were up and we very much enjoyed that experience. You're only allowed about 45 seconds in the room, but it was quite a finale for the day!It's is free to get in to the museum, but the downstairs parking garage is $4 per 15 minutes unless you get validated at The Broad- $12 for 3 hours, quite a difference between potentially $48 for 3 hours. Note that every 15 minutes after 3 hours is taken at the $4 rate.Have fun, enjoy The Broad, see the Disney Concert Hall next door, take a few selfies!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Angelinaxoxo89
50,Modern Contemporary Magic,"Since it's opening in September 2015, I have been back several times. Tickets are free on their website, unless it is for a special exhibition & then charges may apply. I enjoy how the collection rotates so each visit there are new discoveries. The Infinity Mirror room is great and perhaps my most favorite installation has been Ragnar Kjartansson's The Visitors. This museum is an LA gem with a location close to Grand Cedntral Market so it makes for a fun staycation day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J1245TSbarbaram
50,my fav museum in LA,if you like contemporary art this is the place to go. Kusama exhibition was breathtaking. the building itself is also a piece of art. highly recommend this place. even more than LACMA or MOMA,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goolii
50,"Inspiring, beautiful and treasure to enjoy!","We did not have tickets but got in with a 10 min wait on a Friday afternoon. This museum is amazing. The collection is so thoughtful, the lighting is amazing. The museum is not huge so you get to enjoy everything in 1-2 hours. Make reservations if possible. This is a museum not to miss!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/221courtneyb
50,Kept my 14 year old engaged,I took my anime obsessed 14 year old daughter to The Broad. She was completely engaged. She kept posting pictures to all her followers but she seemed to really understand intuitivly the intention of the artists. When she didn't she would ask a VSA. They are amazing. They're enthusiastic and knowledgeable. My only issue with The Broad is the printed text describing the intention of the artist. It seems written for a PhD in philosophy. It would be more helpful if the copy were more accessible. It would be better to let some of the young VSA's take a crack at writing the label copy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brucegrn
50,Free DTLA Contemporary Art Museum ... so worth it!,"Our party of four booked our reservations in advance on August 1st at noon to visit The Broad Museum on 9/9/17.We parked in the structure on 2nd & Broadway which is attached to the museum for $12 all day parking (since it is a weekend, otherwise we would need validation). We took the elevator up and got in the reservation line, not the loooong standby line.We stood in line at 12pm to wait to get in at 12:30pm. Our objective was to get in asap. Immediately after entering the museum we turned left and walked about 30 feet towards the gift shop to find the famous Infinity Mirror Exhibit kiosk. This isn't really a kiosk, it's an iPad on a stick. Anywho, there was no line to sign up and we got our queue to line up for the room in 523 minutes. We projected that we would enter the room by 5:50pm. Since the museum closes at 8pm on Saturday, we were excited that we guaranteed our spot into the highly anticipated mirror room.Now for the art. Everything here is art. The building itself is art. The hallway leading to the 2nd floor and down to 1st floor are art. Some call it an instagram playground but if you take the time to observe and read the details for the photos and art works you'll really appreciate the depth going into each piece. You easily spend 45 mins to 2 hours there. There's quite a lot of work to see. I have to admit I had a fan girl moment when I saw some of Andy Warhol's works. The art rotates as you'll notice there is a huge storage in be basement of more artwork that isn't being displayed.Now clearly, my friends and I were not going to wait until 5:50pm for the Infinity Room so we walked about less than 10 minutes to Grand Central Station for lunch. Before we knew it, we got a text that we were going to be next for the Infinity Room which is 2 hrs earlier than expected. Note that a lot of people cancel. Unfortunately, the link they texted messaged us to check on the queue wasn't working. The museum was very accommodating when we texted our reply that we would be 5 minutes late as we had to rush back to the Broad.Infinity Mirror Room. You can go solo or win another person. But you don't get to clump your 45 seconds together if there's 2 people. It was pretty and everything I imagined. I had my phone ready before I went in and took quite a few photos. I even had 15 seconds left over. It goes by quick but it's plenty of time.Was this adventure worth it? Absolutely. I appreciate the arts and the fact that this free to the public is amazing. If you have the time to book in advance it'll make all the difference.Also compliments to the staff and how well organized the layout of the museum is handled both inside and out. Everyone I spoke to was very friendly, approachable and willing to answer any questions.Must see when in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chloeme5
10,Confusing!,"This place maybe free, but it's still not worth your time! It is not well organized and definitely BORING!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bkute65
50,Get Free Tickets in Advance,This is a relatively new (2 years or so) museum that houses an amazing collection of contemporary art. The building itself is a piece of art work itself. Order free tickets on line and show up on time. Parking is not free but it balances out the free admission. The gift shop is great too. Very attentive and helpful staff. Do not miss the Broad. Downtown LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C134FWmichaelk
40,Free Modern Art Museum,"The Broad is a free museum located in downtown Los Angeles close to the Disney Music Hall, the Superior Court, the Opera and the Music Center (all easy walking distance). You need reservations, often months in advance. The Infinity Room is a must-see - you get 45 seconds in a mirrored room that has hanging lights and is a blast. Reservations are separate for that exhibit, and cannot be made in advance but must be made at the museum when you arrive. We were able to slide in at closing time, because otherwise we would not have gotten into that exhibit.The museum has a lot of modern art that used to be at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, including Warhol's Elvis, Lichtenstein's ""I'm Sorry"" and others, and a decent number of Koons sculptures. You don;t need more than 1-2 hours.Parking is $12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/477kenr
50,Best Collections,"One of the best museums i've ever been. My visits to this place are always smooth and yes i've been here more than once since i always company my friends from other country to come here. I always plan a head by downloading their app and keep checking the ticket availability before going to sleep, after waking up and any other 1 minute time you can spend to check the tickets LOL. Well it's better to do that rather than waiting in a line outside for hours. To be able to get inside The Infinity Room for free before October, you definitely need to book tickets as early as possible before noon, it's already fully booked for September but sometimes some people release their admission tickets cos they're not able to go so keep checking. The store on ground level has many unique items including items from Andy Warhol. All the collections are very nice...that's the reason why i love visiting this place. It's worth all the efforts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdMoch
50,Good date location,I went here and enjoyed all the contemporary and modern art that was displayed. it was very easy to reserve the free tickets that they offer online. the only downside is how complicated it is to reserve a viewing of the infinity room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Plusutra
50,Outstanding attraction,"Plenty of positives for this Museum -- wonderful art, helpful interpretive information, pleasant environment. It's crowded so you definitely want to book the free tickets in advance of your visit and try to get in at an early time if possible. We got in at the 10:30 admission group and immediately signed up for the Infinity exhibit (it turned out to be a 2 and 1/2 hour wait but the texting and auto queue information let's you tour the museum while your queue spot is protected. The bathroom on the first floor is quite small, larger ones are on the second floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECL
50,A Very Cool Museum and Free Too,"Tickets are free but you need to reserve them in advance and get an allocated entry time.The museum is not very large and the collection is eclectic but provocative and fun at the same time. Took us about 60-90 mins to see everything. Only thing we could not see is the infinity room, you have to queue for that separately.Enjoyed our visit and appreciate Eli Broad's gift to LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LuvtoSafari
40,Fantastic and an Eclectic Collection of Art,"You can book tickets ahead and avoid waiting in the lineFYI, the ticket to the museum doesn't include entry into the infinity mirror exhibit.For that, your best bet is to reserve first slot when you book advance tickets and then get there early and reserve your name for the infinity mirror exhibit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sganesan
50,Loved the Fun Exhibits,"My daughter got us timed tickets to be admitted. We enjoyed seeing the fun exhibits such as the giant chair and tables, the blue dog, the crazy paintings and displays. We also signed up to get into the Infinity Room. You get in line and sign up on an iPad. We were told the wait would be 600 minutes! Yikes, but the guy working there said it's usually half that time and they send a text to let you know it's almost your time. We left The Broad after seeing the exhibits and went back to our hotel. We did get a text and were able to quickly take an Uber back and were allowed right in front of the line because we had the text on our phone! The line was not long, maybe 10 minutes. Everyone is allowed to go in by themselves or with someone else for 45 seconds. A girl stands by the door to the room and times it exactly. While everyone else was in the room, the 45 seconds seemed long, but when it's your turn, believe me, it goes really quickly! Yes, everyone we saw came out and immediately looked at their phone to see if they got a good picture. I mean, really, enjoy the moment! ha ha. I, of course, took a photo, but within the first few seconds so I could truly look around in awe when in the exhibit. Don't be married to your phone and miss the actual moment! It is amazing to stand there in the room alone and just look around in wonder. I would definitely return to The Broad for future exhibits or just to spend more time seeing everything I missed the first time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Donna224488
50,Should not miss if in Los Angeles,"One of the world's best and biggest contemporary museums in the world. They have a rotating collection. The place isn't huge but the artworks are incredibly awesome. If you don't have a ticket, just come very early and fall in line to enter. Something worth doing while in Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gerrytan
40,Fabulous small gallery,"Eli Broad has amassed an amazing collection of contemporary art and housed it in a spectacular building -- a quick visit but well worth it except for the Mirror Room which had a four hour wait to visit it -- needless to say, we didn't hang around!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kerryharrismail
50,Great collection that is always changing.,"Book your tickets well in advance - they're free and for a specific time - as opposed to lining up and waiting hours to 'walk in'. As well, the longer you wait to visit during the day, the longer your time will be to see the special exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trevors184
50,One of the best free museums I've ever been to!,"One of the best LA attractions and close to so many other great places. Be sure and walk around the Disney Theater and go inside if you can, even just too see the lobby if you can't get inside hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garygreenblum
50,Book it online FIRST!,"We have planned a relaxing last day in Los Angeles. Took our breakfast and drove to the car park nearby. Saw the long stand-by queue at the entrance... So, we went to take pics of the Disney Hall first. once we got back, the queue was still very long, so we queue up at the end. it was 3pm. and we became the 2nd last of the line while they stop people from queuing! very good and patient security guard who can gently refuses people from queuing. Not an easy job for him. It is free entrance, but they have audience quota for the whole museum. So, don't expect that you can go in as you like. you have to wait till your turn! Better to book your entrance tickets online in advanced. No kidding. Otherwise, you will have to queue for more than an hour to be in! But the ART inside worth the wait!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Seaside49430
50,Wonderful Museum,"One of the most beautiful museums I've visited in my life. The collection is stunning, so many of my favorite artists under the same roof. The exhibition is extremely well organized, with great space between each piece so you can appreciate every single work of art without people getting crowded. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariferduran
40,"More than just impressive,its masterful!!","Probably L.A's second most popular museum,next to the Getty center.One of many free museums to visit here.Worth a visit,make sure you get your reservation online before planing a trip here.The art,the scupltures.the atmosphere,everything about this free museum,makes it a must do,when you are in town in L.A.Dont go before visiting this impressive museum.A tip,Take many pictures but don't get too close to the art and sculptures.Securiry walks all over the place,making sure no one touches anything.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/emberte2015
50,Great museum,"Small, but neat museum with one-of-a-kind pieces. Really have to book a time slot in advance as it can get really crowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/silviacristiana
30,"Long lines, book in advance, worth a visit if in the area or a fan of Warhol and Lichtenstein...","One of L.A.'s newer modern art museums - on Grand Avenue - across the street from the Disney Performance Center. Worth a visit if you're a modern art or architecture fan, or in the downtown Los Angeles area. Book several months in advance - otherwise - will need to line up - up to 1 1/2-2 hours (in our case) - in the scorching heat - but they provided umbrellas. Good collection of Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol pieces. The building itself was quite remarkable - so, great place to take photos. Visit the Disney Performance Center or LA MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) - literally across the street - but all on Grand Avenue. Take a drink, snacks and something to do - if you haven't booked in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ubbabe
50,Excellent,"Founded with the Broad's family collection of contemporary art, this museum is NOT to be missed. The top (third) floor highlights (and rotates) some of the family's personal art collection. Other spaces contain visiting and temporary exhibits by others. What is nice about The Broad is that it is NOT overwhelming. It is ""open"" and spacious, and comfortable so you can ""take it all in"" without getting tired. It's also in a great downtown LA location, near many other noteworthy attractions.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheBrasilian
50,Nice museum,It's free to visit the museum just need to make online reservation. Just the building itself is worth the visit. Nice collection of contemporary art pieces. Too bad the mirrored room is full. They should make it available for booking online as well. The museum shop is amazing with lots of unique and limited edition items.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/M9237GZrebeccal
50,Impressive!,The art work that is displayed within the building is just awesome. Visit this place if you a chance. You can easily spend 3 hours and not get bored of the art work that is displayed. The building from outside is very stylish. Parking is available across the street for about $9. Plenty of staff inside to answer any questions about the art work on display.Strongly recommend.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/222sridhart
50,Great place that's free!,"I've been meaning to go to the Broad, contemporary art museum for some time now: I finally found the time recently. Its located on Bunker Hill in DTLA, and admission is free. You solely have to reserve a time slot in advance (usually takes up to one month in advance). BTW, make sure you validate your parking bc it will cost you $12 for 3 hours, vs $22 vs no validation.Although the Broad is fairly small, it has some unique items like the Tulips, Dog and Huge Table. However, the piece I liked the most was Takashi Murakami's, In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow. It was such an eyegrabbing work of art.Its nice rich peeps like the Broads are philanthropic bc they create cool places like the Broad for everyday folk like you and me to enjoy. Another big plus is the staff is super nice and helpful. If you are in DTLA, do take time to visit this unique place. It only takes a couple of hours tops to enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KeoPAloha
40,Worth the Wait,the building itself is a work of art. Exhibits rotate so its a good idea to visit on a routine basis. Something that may be on display one month may not be there another. The highlights and the most popular items are usually on display.Great time. It was a nice surprise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DS9MW
50,AWESOME,"Loved this place! Tickets I have heard are difficult to get but I got there early and lined up and did not have a problem getting in. I went when the infinity room was there, sooo cool! Strongly suggest this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/setbutterfly
40,Beautiful Broad!,"As you can expect by the name of this museum, the Broad, I love the huge size of the art works displayed in the museum--modern, grand and bright!!! I took a group of 5 senior ladies there. Everyone was impressed. I plan to take my grandsons there in the near future. Combining your downtown Los Angeles trip with the Broad will be a great day adventure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/142SusanR
50,My Favorite Museum,The Broad has become my favorite museum in LA. The exterior of the building is a piece of art. It's located in dtla which has so much to see as well. The Broad is a must visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveFawley
50,New Downtown,Special renaissance of Downtown L.A. Contemporary Art and very fashion multi-styles building. Get in for admiring what's inside this jewel. Lucky you if u will find the right show just in time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/194gianlucav
50,Great.,"I really enjoyed my visit to the Broad. I found the collection to be varied and thought provoking. I enjoyed the timed entry, I found it easier than waiting in a ridiculously long line. It also allowed me to view the art without fighting a massive crowd.Parking and entry were easy. Most of the staff were kind and helpful. As a solo lady traveler, I felt safe in the neighborhood and museum/parking structure.I only had two issues with which I was not pleased.1. Infinity Room. You have to sign up for a time slot, but I was told the list had filled at 11 am that day. My museum ticket was for 3 pm, so I had no chance of getting in. It would seem to make more sense to have a certain number of spots per timed entry time, rather than per day. That way, it's on me if I don't sign up in time, rather than being unlucky and not getting a morning slot.2. The woman at the front with the clipboard told me I didn't need a parking validation. I did. I had to pay $22 for an hour visit (instead of $12) because I didn't have a validation. You owe me ten bucks, clipboard lady. I take venmo.Overall, I would go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LiveWithHope
50,Fantasitc Visit,"A challenge to get tix, but go if you are able. An amazing structure with incredible modern art. All well curated, with an audio guide to help explain significance.Not to be missed if you have any interest at all in Art,,,,,, and to see a great collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Getitright212
30,Interesting architecture but not worth the wait,"Long lines - need to get ticket in advance. However, they let the standbys in before the next time slot, which makes it harder to get in the electronic queue to see Kusama's over-hyped Infinity Mirrors. Took 3+ hours to see that despite having tickets for 10:30 (opens at 10), partly because they let in the standbys before us. It's just not worth the wait - very limited architecture and the Emperor has no clothes! Fortunately, the nearby Disney -LA Phil Music Hall is open with a free audio tour so if you really need to wait to see the 1 minute viewing of Infinity Mirror room, there is something constructive to do",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LindaF580
50,One of my favorite Museums!,"I went to the museum alone while exploring LA. I had heard of the museum month before my trip and I'm glad I did. Entry into the museum is free however if you want to avoid standing in an obnoxiously long line you should book your ticket a month in advance when they are available on the Broad's website. Their was a special exhibit by Yayoi Kusama that I wanted to see so when I got to the museum I first checked in for the exhibit and explore the museum as I waited for a text message that it was my turn to see the special exhibit (about a 1hr 30min wait). Overall, it was a beautiful experience The Broad has a lot unique pieces and their staffers are very knowledgeable about the work which is nice. The is also a cute gift shop with awesome souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nomaadic_tiffany
50,Absolutely loved it,"This place is great. Beautiful, varied collection, not too busy, easy to get to and free! I would recommend booking in advance, I was early for my time slot and the standby queue was already around the block. If you want to see the Yanoi Kusama Infinity Room then I recommend booking the first time slot of the day, you are more likely to get in and then can wander around the rest of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ennjaydub
50,THE place to see contemporary art,"Plan ahead and get a free reservation for admission. Show up at your appointed time, and be whisked to a playground for art lovers. Ask the guards about the art--some double as docents! Many icons of the last 30 years are here, though I would have liked to have seen a David Hockney. But I quibble. A wonderful collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WideEyedTraveler
50,A burst of colors,"I finally made it to The Broad & I'm so glad I did! I was on the email notification list for some time. The tickets ""sell out"" quick! I reserved our Aug 6th trip in July 1st. Yep, over one month in advance.The building itself is worth the visit. It's open, airy, bright, minimal and perfectly suited to showcase the art.I was happy to see some art that I hadn't seen before by artist who I am familiar with.You'll only pay for parking but you can also take the Amtrak or public transit. It's very easy to spend some time here without leaving feeling overwhelmed by too much info.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seesumigo
50,An extraordinary museum!,We were very impressed with the Broad. We visited with our entire family ranging in ages from teens to seniors. The size and quality of the artwork is very special. Make sure to take a guided tour. Our guide was great and knowledgeable and put a different perspective on the pieces. Try to get tickets ahead of time so you can not wait in the long line and enjoy more of the experience of the museum. You can order tickets on line.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Offthecouch65
50,Wonderful Museum,"We had to wait in the standby line as you needed to book a time months in advance. The wait was just over 1 hour, we got there at 10am. Museum opens at 11. The feature exhibit is worth the wait. The 3rd floor has many interesting pieces of art. I definitely recommend visiting this museum",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gol1ca
40,Impressive new museum for LA,"▪️Location: Easy access in Downtown LA.▪️Parking: In same building as The Broad. Underground structure accessed from 2nd Street. Remember to validate at The Broad for reduced pricing.▪️Collection: Paintings and sculptures, mainly by well known 20th century artists.▪️Other: Impressive Infinity Mirrored Room which requires a separate ticket.▪️Staffing: Friendly staff who pop in with observations and then allow visitors to proceed at their own pace.▪️Highlights for us: Jasper Johns, Warhol, Ruscha, Lietchenstein.▪️Cost: Free. You pay for parking which in our case was $12.▪️Recommend? Yes",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/packcal
50,Loved this visit,"I wasn't able to get advance tickets as recommended, but the wait at 2pm on Tuesday was less than 30 minutes (the Twitter feed reported 45 minutes wait) Excellent space and interesting collection. One hour is enough time to see the two floors, and not at all crowded inside. Worthwhile visit, disappointed to find that MOCA, right across the street was closed on Tuesdays. But the Central Market is nearby. Highlight for me was Cy Twombly room. Free admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dz182
50,Don't miss this!,This is a relatively new art gallery and was not listed in my travel guide. It is free and very popular. Unfortunately it has 90 minute queues in the sun most of the time. It is not easy to get an advanced ticket but try to do so. Even waiting in the queue - in my opinion - it is the best modern art gallery in LA. The design inside and out is interesting and the exhibits very well curated. At the present time there is a Yayoi Kusama mirror room (requiring yet another queue & wait) you are only allowed 45 seconds but it is brilliant! There is no restaurant in here and it really can be done thoroughly in a couple of hours but there is a big outdoor eating area close by and the Walt Disney concert hall next door to make a totally first class day out in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SueKeo
50,You can do it in 68 minutes,"Shhhhhh! No one wants to admit this. We are supposed to think we have to spend hours rambling the galleries, minutes reflecting on the power of each piece, you know...But the truth is you should see this beautiful edifice, inside and out, no matter what, and since it is free, you can justify zipping through and know you'll be able to return! Giant table and chairs, gorgeous Pollocks, crazy African-American-inspired silhouettes... and your mind is shaken up a bit and you feel the joy of human creativity for a bit and revel in the wonder of being able to think for a bit...Thank you to the Broad family for sharing your collection with us. I appreciate it more than I know how to express.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CH85259
50,An ode to Broad's ego but a great museum nonetheless,Visited on a Friday night (my favorite) and the museum wasn't really crowded. We love coming here on Friday night's as we can then walk down to the Central Market fo rdinner later and the museum seems less crowded. The art itself is fantastic and well presented. I just wish it could have been done in conjunction with the LA county Museum to broaden it's appeal. A small thing I guess. Well worth a visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StudioCityMark
50,LA visit Day 1,"A trip to LA with my college bound daughter was on the agenda. She loves art and this is what she wanted to do for gradation just the two of us, no pesky brothers to ruin the experience so we headed to The Broad.We did not have advance tickets which would have been better but you have to get them a month in advance. Since this was a last minute trip we arrived an hour early as reviews suggested. We were still about 10 back in line. It was hot and in full sun so take sunscreen, water, and have patience as it is worth it. About 15 before opening, staff appeared with umbrellas for shade and that was great. The staff was able to answer questions.When we finally entered behind all the ticket holders, we signed up for the infinity mirror exhibit. They took our reservation and phone number so they could text us when it was our turn. We had an 83 minute wait but was able to tour the museum until our time. Make sure you sign up for this immediately when you enter as later in the day you will not get a reservation.I love the wide variety of art with numerous mediums. The building itself is a work of art. The elevator is even worth the ride. I wish we had signed up for a tour as many times the story behind it is more interesting than the piece itself.The museum is free but parking was $30 just two blocks away across from the MOCA museum. We had a great lunch at a nice cafe. There were lots of food trucks and typical sandwich shops in the area.The Broad is right across the street from the Philharmonic hall and they allow free self guided tours that start no later than 2pm but we didn't have time. Lots to do in this one area. If we had advance tickets, we could have toured the concert hall, then The Broad, then MOCA all for the same $30 parking just don't go on a Wednesday as MOCA is closed.Highly recommend this museum, three to four hours was plenty for us.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MMELittleRock
50,A must visit!,"I absolutely love this museum! I've been inside multiple times and each time I visit I still get excited! Great art collection, you have to see it for yourself.

50,"Modern art, instagram friendly!",Really unique and modern art you won't find anywhere else. Exhibits are very instagram friendly so you'll be taking nonstop pictures! Enjoy,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/arash1111
50,Great Modern Art Treat,"I love this space- the architecture sets off the huge modern art collection of the Broads! Every level has a fun discovery! Changing feature exhibits added to standing collection will keep me coming back! Great for out of town tourists- if you decide to go to this part of DTLA you can visit the MomA across the street, the Geffen Museum is nearby in little Tokyo, look at the Disney Hall- all in one stop! We broke for lunch at Grand Central Market and continued our fun exploration! We are local, but put on our tourist hats for the day and had a blast!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/239RebeccaR
50,Architecture and Modern - both great,"The layout is visually exciting. After entering a beautiful archtectural gem, one takes a stunning esalator into the interior and masterful modern art. Staff folks are incredibly helpful and readily anwser questions and not intrusive. You need to make the free reservations ahead because the no reservations line is quite long",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casimirot909
50,An amazing experience,"The broad is just an amazing place to visit if you're in the area. The building alone is stunning, let alone the incredible art on the inside. I recommend booking a free ticket in advance, as the 'free' no ticket line gets extremely long and doesn't guarantee entry!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/georgiar251
40,"Get Tickets in advance! Interesting exhibits, interesting architecture","We spent 1/2 a day at The Broad during a weekend in LA, and it was really neat!As a museum, there's a lot of interesting modern art - all presented well, and with good descriptions on the pieces and backstory.Highly recommend getting tickets in advance. We reserved tickets online (free) a few months in advance, and were glad we did - by 10:30am there was a ""standby"" line down the block to get in, but we just walked to our timed ticket line about 10 minutes before the time we signed up for - no real line, no fuss.Architecturally, the Broad is interesting because it's a building with a shell around it. Inside, it is very organic in appearance. As with any art museum it's a lot of walking, reading, and contemplating.Well worth a 1/2 day visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/scottesandiego
40,Unusual structure,The Broad is located in Los Angeles Downtown near the Omni hotel. It is an unusual structure look like a bird's nest.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AntoNic7
50,Awesome place to check out,"You must plan in advance. Tickets are free and made available on the first of the month. It's not huge but has many amazing pieces and some cool exhibits. Some of the exhibits you need to get a ticket for when you get there. So it's one of those ""go early"" if you want one. We went at 2pm and could not get one. They go pretty fast. The view of the storage room is pretty cool. You can see how they store the art before putting into an exhibition. Parking around there is about $20. Take public transport if you can.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/name303
50,Something NEW in LA!,"There was so much buzz about this new museum I had to see it as soon as it was open, and I did. Simply dazzling. This is a persona, broad ranging collection, from the Eli Broad family. It rotates and they bring in other artists for special exhibits. AND it is free BUT you need to make a reservation to avoid the long wait ling especially if you want to buy a ticket to a special exhibit. Whatever you do, it is worth the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/viz1967
40,Interesting Exterior,"Very interesting exterior, but all tickets were booked so we did not have the opportunity to see the interior or exhibitions inside. If you hope to visit the museum, plan way ahead of time and book tickets early, like as soon as they are available for reservations.Right nest to the Disney Concert Hall so you can see two architectural sites without too much walking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WunderFulLife
50,Reserve tickets ahead of time & enjoy!,"Reserved tickets online when they got available. By 10 a.m., there were 200+ people waiting for a day ticket outside in a hot sun! Check out the museum's web site for advanced reservation ticket info. Great museum with nice selections, we had a great time. Staff were helpful and easy parking at the museum, $12 all day Sunday.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lv2C
40,Must-See Art!,"The Broad has a great selection of art, definitely worth the visit! I scheduled my visit ahead of time (which you can do on their website), which allows you free entrance at a specific date/time. This means you avoid waiting in line (which is the option if you didn't book ahead of time). Can get crowded, but that is expected in my opinion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daniel_dinzi
50,Deserves All the Hype,"I now live in DTLA, but I went to the Broad within its first month of opening when I was still a West-sider. It's a phenomenal space with eye-popping art that appeals to art history buffs and laymen alike. Tickets are free, but you have to reserve well in advance online, perhaps a month or so before you want to go. One of the most remarkable things about the Broad is that all of the security guards are also trained to speak about the art and really know some interesting facts.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T5193HZmelissad
50,AMAZING contemporary art museum.,"Really amazing contemporary art museum open in downtown LA. Best part: it's free to go! Make sure you check the closing time though, you want to give yourself enough time to see everything. Also, MOCA is right across the street.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pyramid_livin
40,They definitely possess some jewels of contemporary arts,"The wait for infinite mirrors room is enormously long, if you don't book it well in advance on line.Consider some couple of hours here in this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sherry_Geek
40,Fun and free!,"We did not reserve tickets ahead of time and arrived aprox 15 after the museum opened. We were told we would probably wait between 90-100 mins before we could get in, but it ended up being only 60 mins. The museum was very nice and not crowded very crowded. Backpacks must be worn on your front or side, not your back, but they do allow you to check your backpack.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mishelle719
50,Amazing contemporary collection,"If you enjoy contemporary art, this is the perfect museum for you. Warhol, Sherman, Twombly, Basquiat, just to name a few. The layout is very walkable and friendly for visiting, The museum shop was so-so. Usually I can find a few things I have to have in a museum gift shop, but this one was rather boring. Mostly books, which I can buy cheaper online. But aside from the gift shop, everything else was amazing, even the escalator ride up to the second floor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hpybdaymrpresident
30,It Was Free,"I only really paid The Broad a visit as it was free and was kinda hoping I'd have some sort of epiphany when it comes to modern art but, alas, nothing! Seeing a chess board with 9x9 squares instead of 8x8 did nothing for me and getting scolded by an attendant for standing too close was a bit much.A lot of people will love the exhibits, it's just not for me.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/newspapertaxi
50,Free and fun!,The Broad has an excellent collection of contemporary (from 1950-present) paintings. You must reserve your tickets in advance for a specific time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lestroyens
40,Checked out a new museum,"We had a party of 8, including 3 adults and 5 teens. Entry is free, but since we didn't have a reservation we paid the additional fee to see the Cindy Sherman exhibit, so to we only had to wait around 20 minutes to get in. We haven't been able to see the Infinity Room yet, but hope to this year. The reservations can only be made once you enter the Broad, and are first come, first serve. Lovely art. Two stories. We walked to (iconic) Grand Central Market for lunch.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kimbabble
30,Average at best,"The building has some cool architectural features and the gift shop is interesting but the exhibits were mediocre at best. To be honest, I am not a huge modern art fan so perhaps didn't appreciate it as much as some others would have.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travel72
50,Brand new modern art museum,"Dizzying! Wonderful layout. First class art. Well-known artists as well as younger ones I did not know of yet. Several videos were running in the special exhibit ""Oracle."" A must see museum. Free admission, but reservations required and the availability is limited. A four-week wait is likely.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dHwoman
50,"Great collection, highly recommended","Located downtown LA, you can get there easily by metro/subway, approximately 15 min walk from Little Tokyo arts district. Admission is free, but you shoul book it 2-3 weeks in advance to secure your spot. If you don't there's still a chance you'll get in. Every day a standby lineup forms up in front if the building, and depending on the capacity (if some of the pre-registered visitors don't show up) they let you in. Waiting times vary, it was about 15min for me, but I know for a fact that it could be way longer. Check out there twitter feed fir info on waitinh time, they post it daily. Also, their website mentions it in more detail, worth going through that befire planning your visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/627justynap
50,Beautiful museum focused on modern art. Get your tickets in advance!,Nice way to spend a couple hours in downtown LA. Definitely get your tickets in advance. Our tickets had a set admission time and we walked past a long line of people hoping to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA-LONDON-NYC
40,Be early!,"My advice is if it's summer, be early, be very early! We waited in the blistering sun for nearly two hours (1.50) to get in, there are staff handing out umbrellas but somehow they kept missing us even after repeatedly asking for one. Going inside was a relief but by then we were actually exhausted, and could not even get into the infinity room or book it for a later date. It certainly is worth a visit but not the wait, so plan well, sorry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Goretti_13
30,Very interesting,Went to visit the Broad with a group of teen girls and friends very interesting art. Lots of things to see. Some of the stuff was kinda odd but I'm not an art critic. Many different prospectives of how people view art. It's good to experience different forms of art. Had a nice time.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rosalindam846
50,So cool!,"We made reservations to go to the Broad while visiting Los Angeles. You need to make reservations ahead of time. So we booked our tickets May 1st for June. The tickets are free but if you don't reserve you have to stand in a very long line. The building is amazing. They have two different floors of galleries. There was pieces of art by Keith Haring, Andy Warhol among others. There was even a giant dining room table that you can stand under. We had a great time. My family of teenagers really enjoyed themselves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/karenm502
50,Amazing collection but book ahead; fantastic staff,Bizarre ticketing system. Either stand in a very long line or book ahead. I booked for June on May 1 the first day that the free tickets are available for the following month. Fantastic collection of modern and contemporary art. A good size; large enough but not intimidatingly so. Each of the galleries has mostly just one or two artists so is really great to be able to see several works by the same artist together. Minimal informaton on the walls. But I discovered that the staff while also doing guard duty are all artist types and really well trained and eager to engage. I had many interesting discussions with the staff and I went up to several and asked them to explain a piece and they did so uniformly in an intelligent and interesting way. I ended up spending three hours in the museum. Note that there is no cafe inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeBirdman
50,Amazing!,"My friends and I went here primarily for the infinity room. The Broad opens at 11am and it has 2 different floors of art. I would highly recommend signing up for the inifinity room as soon as you get in the Broad because it gets filled up fast and they only take a limited number of people. My friends and I waited for 3h before it was our turn. We spent time by visiting the other 2 floors and going for Beantage. The inifinty room was definitely phenomenal, however, you only get 45s/person in there so make sure you take full advantage of it by being mentally and physically ready",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tvo_kid
50,Great modern museum,Enjoyed this museum. We reserved tickets (free) in advance. It's a very cool museum and a good size. Cool to be able to see into the room where they store the art.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aubspl
50,Best museum ever,"Probably my favourite permanent collection of modern art in the world. The selection of XX century art is just exquisite, every single room blows your mind. The building itself is a true gem. Tickets are free and the wait wasn’t that long, less than 30 minutes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SincereIyYours
50,A little gem in the heart of Downtown LA.,This contemporary art museum is very interesting. It's also small enuf to manage your viewing with friendly staff visible and available in every room. A beautiful building of unusual design and there is the really intriguing Infinity Mirrored Room to queue for. Take the time to wait for an opportunity to get in...it's worth it. The museum is wonderful for young and old. It has clean restrooms and convenient drinking water fountains. Ubering is easy. The local buses also run close by. Entry is free.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tereza09
50,Pick your favorite,I loved this museum. You can see the best art in the world- for free! Staff was also very friendly and I loved the gift shop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HappyJana
50,Love a good free art gallery!,Love the broad. Always a wait if you don't get tickets in advance but I don't mind as it's never painfully long & it's free! If there's an individual entry exhibit then i'd recommend signing up for that on your way in before you see the rest of the gallery so you don't have to wait too long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/637katherinem
50,An excellent museum that impresses on all counts - but get your tickets early!,"Booked weekend evening tickets weeks in advance - but it was well worth the effort. The museum is beautiful, the collection a joy to go through with helpful explanatory information in most cases to help visitors better understand the works on display. Must go in LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ECWorld
50,Book ahead to avoid waiting,The Broad is free and you can queue on the day but booking ahead means you avoid the lines. There are some great example of modern art to enjoy. The gallery isn't huge so a couple of hours is probably enough.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LouisePeacock
50,GREAT MUSEUM,"First tip is to book tickets online, it's free so you could plan in advance and pick a date. An e-ticket will be sent to you and entrance is super easy. The museum is beautiful, lots of natural light and contemporary art. Great for the younger crowd. It's constantly packed but worth the visit. I suggest spending about 3-4 hours here. A must go when in LA !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Selinawongg
50,Contemporary Delight,"We booked tickets on the 1st of May for a June 4th visit since we were not able to get tickets on short notice on our previous 2 visits to LA. I truly enjoyed the curation, I read about 20% of the blurbs accompanying various works of art and usually felt enriched by the art history and social commentary provided (e.g. Andreas Gursky's photos). I appreciated the diversity of artists represented in the Broad collection, in particular noting that female artists seemed better represented in this museum.And I want to commend the staff, I had interactions with at least a half dozen and found them consistently top notch. Bravo to The Broad!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MtWhitney07
50,The lines are long but worth the wait,"We were to late to book on-line ... it has to be done a month in advance. But we had heard the lines weren't too bad, so we got there about 11 am on a Sunday and were inside before noon. Well-organized line management. The space itself is spectacular and we found the Oracle display selections captivating, although unsettling and basically angst-producing. But those are the times we live in. The permanent collection selections on the 3rd floor were the best of contemporary art and were a joy to wander through. Great addition to the LA art scene.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmjc
50,reach early....need to stand in queue to get in. Or book ahead online.,"best of all its free....but limited entry so either book tickets online or reach by 10am as the museum opens at 11am.I had breakfast at this wonderful place called Bottega Louie and then strolled over to the museum. Wish I had walked briskly instead, but it did not matter much.... got in after about an hour.....can spend the time chatting with the people around.Museum was really lovely....catch the talks by the staff...they bring the exhibit alive and are very interactive. Were done by lunch....and there was a mexican fruit cart outside selling refreshing cut fruits with a special spicy sour sauce and salt.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/alpanabhartia
50,Definately worth a visit - but book ahead to save time!!,"Spectacular building from the outside and even more interesting from inside! Be sure to book your tickets (free) ahead of time to avoid the long lines for standby tickets. Apparently late Thursday and Friday are best if you don't have a pre-booked ticket. Interesting collection, loads of helpful staff to answer questions, fascinating glimpse into their storage area on the second level via a stairway...well worth a visit if you are in town!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melbourne-vic
40,Crazy long line!,"It was worth my hour wait since the tickets were free, but I don't think I would do it if the temp was over 90 degrees. I enjoyed the big airy space, and the exhibits were well laid out. Only took and hour to see everything though.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mona-isabella
50,Super Cool Modern Art,"Not easy to get a ticket but as soon as the window opened I got them knowing we'd be in LA for a trip. My wife and I are big fans of this type of art and the museum didnt disappoint. 2 exhibit floors. Fascinating design of the building. It seems you will certainly miss some of the exhibits as you go around but somehow it leads you to them all. We spent about 90 minutes there. There was a long line of people hoping to get in so get tx in advance. Best of all, its free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sccrref
50,Amazing Architecture and Great Collection - make reservations,"This is a wonderful Free Museum in Downtown LA and well worth a visit. If you can make timed reservations, if not just go there and you may wait an hour (check their website) . But it is worth it. Download The Broad and you will get a guide to the museum on its collection and also the architecture. If you are looking to have an elegant lunch or dinner make reservations at the Otium. Keep your ticket to reenter the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StellaHobo
50,Call all modern art fans!,"This amazing, privately purchased collection is being shared with anyone who wants to make an online reservation. I remember the building going up, and the final result is amazing. Plan accordingly, eat at Grand Central Market (down the hill) and visit!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JDinLA
50,Long wait but worth it,"Really beautiful and reasonably-sized collection. We waited outside for probably half an hour but it was nothing to complain about, it's nice to people-watch and take in downtown LA anyway. I loved the architecture and of course the fact that it was free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/556carriey
40,Long queue but enjoyable,"My Uber driver recommended this place to me, and I was already in Downtown LA and decided to check it out. I recommend booking tickets in advance because I arrived at 4pm and queued for an hour, and it closed at 6pm.The Museum itself was very modern, and the artwork inside was both modern and contemporary, which isn't always my thing but the collection they housed was interesting and enjoyable. If I remember correctly it was free as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/240kieranf
30,Annoying staff,Museum was half empty and still we had to wait an hour in the line and then more to get another ticket for another hall. No lockers and they just put the bag a room somewhere. They are really obsessed with putting your bag in front ( not back or side god forbid) which really made it uncomfortable the all time walking around.The art is intriguing and nice ( mostly).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bend721
50,Very complete,"Modern, neat, not crowded. Perfect for a quick visit. The only «bad» thing is the lack of small souvenirs.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733mariellah
50,Contemporary art at its best,The Broad is an amazing collection of contemporary art. Entry is free and tickets are released each month which can be booked online.Standby tickets are available but be prepared for a very long wait.The Infinity Mirror installation is a sensory experience. When you enter the Broad you can put your name on a waiting list and staff will send you a text when your viewing slot becomes available.If you are travelling by public transport you can access The Broad from the nearby Civic Center Metro Station (Red or Purple Lines).,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/amandarK201NO
50,Must See in Downtown LA,"I made a last minute decision to visit The Broad and it's collection of modern art on a sunny Saturday and glad I did. Didn't get advanced tickets, however the queue was well-managed and waited less than 30 minutes. Admission is free and once inside, even on this very busy day, there was plenty of space for all to move freely and view the art, and interact with pieces where appropriate. The museum has a great collection of modern art pieces, including perhaps the largest collections of both Jeff Koons and Cindy Sherman as well as classically modern pieces from Ed Ruscha, Roy Lichtenstein, Barbara Kruger, John Baldessari, Anselm Kiefer and many others. If you go, know that the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art is across the street and can be visited on the same day, the Disney Concert Hall is next door and offers tours and the Grand Central Market with outdoor dining and refreshment is only a 10 minute walk from the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/97mikep
50,Fun & Unique,"I can't believe I forgot to review this LA gem! My husband and I knew we might be leaving LA to go back to the east coast, so we scoured Trip Advisor to look for any must see attractions in this city.I started looking for tickets in March or April, but realized they were all booked up. I should point out tickets are free, you can order them online or wait in the standby line (which could take HOURS). I signed up for the e-mail list for The Broad, so when I learned tickets would be available May 1st I made sure to be on the website ASAP at the release time. I tried to for the earliest available weekend tickets, they were about 5 weeks out from 5/1. This is a good activity to plan in advance for so you can get tickets on the date you need.I opted for a ticket time of 11 AM. I highly recommend doing anything like this in LA first thing in the morning. There is usually not enough parking in the city of LA, so it's 100% worth it to be up and at 'em before the rest of the Angelenos. It's great to sleep in, but generally not worth it if you have to compete for parking spots and deal with more traffic on the highways. The Broad has a parking lot, it's $12 on weekends, but pricier on weekdays.I am not an art person, but while in California I also visited Getty Center, LACMA and Getty Villa. I was very disappointed in LACMA, it seemed like it hadn't been updated much since the 80's, which was kind of sad since this town is a mecca for creatives. We loved the architecture and grounds of the two Getty buildings, but a lot of the art pieces were replications. Before going to The Broad, my assessment of the LA art was that it did not rival anything in NYC (where I lived a few hours from for most of my life).We arrived a bit before our ticket time, so we had to wait in a line outside for a few minutes. Once we got in we checked out some of the art in the lobby and ascended up the escalator to the main museum floor. The bright colored Takashi Murakami exhibit was one of the first exhibits we saw and one of my favorites. I don't know much about Murakami, but he did have some amazing collaborations with Louis Vuitton back in the 2000's.It didn't take us terribly long to get through the museum, it's not particularly large. I would say it's probably safe to budget 1-2 hours of time for your visit. I could see taking teenagers here, as it is a very unique and fun experience. This is definitely not drab 17th century French art, which to be honest, kind of bores me. I would not recommend taking small children here, as they don't want you to touch most of the art (understandably so).I didn't know about Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room until a few days before my visit, so we unfortunately were not able to secure tickets and experience this. It looks amazing though and if you can get tickets in advance, it's probably great to experience.Again, I really loved how the art here was so fun and vibrant. Make sure your camera phone is charged up before you visit, there are some neat photo ops. One of my favorite photos of my husband and I was taken under the Robert Therrien table & chairs.If you are planning a trip to LA, I would definitely recommend working this in to your schedule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NYCaliKara
50,Amazing and it is free!,This Museum has the most wonderful collection. The physical plant is easy to navigate and the galleries are light. What a wonderful addition to the 'art scene' in LA.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelG5
50,Lives up to the hype!,"We didn't get advanced tickets, but showed up Sunday afternoon and got in after waiting just 15 minutes. The times online/twitter were WAY exaggerated so I recommend just showing up and checking what the wait is if you don't have tickets.Inside, the main collection is FANTASTIC. I don't usually love art museums but this is really great and of course the fact that it's free doesn't hurt!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/friendofjojo
50,great art museum - must see,"This is a new museum showing the Broad Collection - very modern, contemporary (Basquiat) Admission is free so there may be a long line BUT - if there is a special exhibit and you pay for that, you don't have to wait in line. Therefore, in my opinion, even if you aren't interested in the special exhibit, (but why wouldn't you be) it definitely is worth paying for it - it was maybe $15.00. I go to alot of aet museums so I think that inside this one there is also a special area behind a curtain where you go in alone for a few minutes and walk on a wooden walkway over water with flashing lights. As long as you are there, you should see this.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phillygirl2017
50,Well worth a visit.,"We were told about this wonderful, relatively new museum and when we knew we were going to LA my wife found out about calling a month before our visit to make reservations. What a treasure for the community to have the Broad family lend their name, support and art collection for locals and visitors alike to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elliotr977
50,An awesome modern art museum,"An awesome and free museum downtown. I especially loved the giant, larger-than-life art here, although the whole thing was great. They have a little area in the stairwell where you can peek into where they store art, too, which is pretty cool. If you enjoy art then this is definitely one to see! Get tix online to avoid wait times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsmetheresac
40,Fun Modern and Avant Garde Art Scene,"The Broad is a cool place to visit to be part of the Avant Garde art scene...the space itself is quite interesting...but unless you follow art or have a very open mind you will wonder what all the fuss is about. I love art and lived in New York City, but somehow I feel this place is missing some major content...but it is fun to experience and lots of great restaurants around it to explore...maybe stop over to the Modern Art Museum across the street for additional immersion. Must do: Make a reservation for a smoother entry.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/calleyne
40,CONTEMPORARY Art,"I capitalize the contemporary because it really is contemporary o the inside and outside. Located in the LA Financial District right next to the Disney Concert Hall.We went early to avoid lines and to get into the Infinity Room without having to wait for hours. The Infinity Room, designed by Yayoi Kusama was pretty awesome. Smaller than I expected, it still took you out of this world. The museum only allows you to stay inside for one minute so you'll have to make the most of it.Other popular works of art are the ""Under The Table"" piece of work by Robert Therrien, the ""Balloon Dog"" and ""Tulips"" by Jeff Koons, and the stacked plates, also by Therrien.The museum is two stories with multiple wings. You can spend anywhere from an hour to 5 depending on your intrigue. My girlfriend and I spent a good 2.5 hours inside before getting hungry for lunch.If you're in LA, this is one of the better museums. Do it for the IG as most do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/itsDannyLin127
50,Loved this museum!,"We should have planned more in advance for this one. Tickets are free, but you can reserve them in advance. We should have done this. We stood in line for probably about an hour and we were in line only 5 minutes after it opened. So, if you don't have tickets reserved, go early! However, we waited and it was well worth the wait. The art is very modern and immersive. The way everything is displayed flows perfectly. There is a separate installation inside the museum, which requires you to get in line/put your name on the list. That wait was 2-3 hours for us, but you can leave the museum and come back so you're aren't stuck walking around the same place for that long. All in all, one of my favorite museums.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristentuell
50,Architectural Gem.,"Full of iconic modern art pieces.The design of the building is also very impressive.Apparently timed entry fills very quickly when releasaed , which is a problem for o/seas visitors. However the ""standby "" line is quite reasonable if you arrive around a couple of hours before closing time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/24MalO
40,"Free admission, but you may wait a long time to get in","I hadn't made an advance reservation, so waited in the standby line for an hour to gain admission. When I got inside, the gallery was far from crowded, so the silly line seems ridiculous. The works are contemporary and very, so you can see the entire collection in less time than it took to gain entrance. The contemporary art isn't for everyone (I enjoyed most of it) and the building almost overshadows what's inside. Across the street from the Gehry-designed Disney concert hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marblehead750
50,"A Must See--Get Advance Tickets Or Wait In Line, But It's Worth It!","This is a wonderful new contemporary art museum. If you are in LA you really should make time to see it. The building is a beautiful design itself, but the collection of contemporary art on view is absolutely first rate--a contemporary who's who in the art world and excellent works by each of the artists in the collection.Admission to The Broad is free, but you must have a ticket to go in. It's best if you plan your visit in advance and go to their website: the broad.org and reserve your advance tickets for the date and time period you wish to visit. If you are there, as we were and all of the advance tickets are sold out already, there is a line across from the Disney Concert Hall that will allow you to wait for an opening to go in. We waited in line for about an hour--depending on the day and time your wait could be more or less. If you have Twitter, you can check TheBroadStandby to see what the current wait is. There is also an app for The Broad which will give you the wait time and allow you to purchase tickets.The Broad has it's own parking garage; take your ticket with you and have it validated in the museum for three discounted hours of parking in the museum. Be aware, however, that if you stay longer than three hours, there is no discount and you'll pay full price for all of the hours you parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192debd
50,spectacular new museum- stunning and great art!,loved my visist. Special instralation with lots of reflected lights on the first floor. the art upstairs was exceptional. I loved the collection and the groupings. It is a very big place. I think itis hard to keep a group together. the building is beautiful and it was fun to see the neighborhood. That said I do not undersstand why the new trend is for everyone to open a museum with their own name on it. Would it be better adding toe LACMA where the Broad's have already given a building?,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlsoduku
50,Great new museum - free admission!,"Order your tickets early because it's free and tickets on the weekend are probably gone already. Parking is easy and validated and the museum is large enough to see a number of pieces but not overwhelming. Also, the rooms are by artist which is a nice feature.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K2209VLteresam
50,Great modern art,"We ordered the free tickets on line, having read reviews that suggested doing so. Arrived 15 minutes before our assigned time and were ushered right in! Very new, very interesting building, from the outside and inside. A great variety of art, from oversized table and chairs, to Andy Warhol, to tremendous murals, something for everyone. Old and young alike were intrigued. Did not make use of the AP that explained varied artworks as we were pressed for time, but next time will allow enough time to do so. You start at the top floor- travelling up by an escalator through a tunnel like fixture and work your way around through the endless number of rooms. REally creative, and to think this is just some of the art collected by the Broad family!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mommal2014
50,Great Contemporary Art,Can't believe this is for free. Thank you to the generous family who envisioned and then manifested this museum. Loved the Infinity Room although you only get to spend 2 minutes in it. Loved the Jeff Koons' Michael jackson sculpture and the colorful blue balloon dog. Many wonderful world-class pieces of art to enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/grandoldgirlb

50,Fantastic modern art,"This is a relatively new museum for LA and it was really cool. The museum houses the private art collection for Eli Broad, a well know LA developer. The museum doesn't take long to go through, but give yourself at least an hour. The tickets are free but you need to reserve well in advance as the museum is very popular. The art is allModern and interesting. We went on a satiety afternoon and there were food trucks outside and there is also a small grove of olive trees that are really beautiful right next to the museum. It is a beautiful way to spend a couple of hours in DTLA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/299daniellep

After entering you put your reservation in on an iPad, return and wait to enter a secret chamber. It's a blacked out mirrored room with an island in the middle and water on the floor. You get 45 seconds inside to experience either the beginning of time or the end of time, based on your optimism. It's so worth the trouble to experience this. You enter either solo or with a partner.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rocor335

50,Free entry and Beautiful Art Collection,"We booked in advance to get inside the museum as we heard that it can get so crowded any day. We were there on a weekday so the queue at 10AM wasn't that long yet although it was hot outside. The staff were kind enough to lend people ""baking"" outside an umbrella. The queue for the infinity room was long however I am happy that we were able to get a slot only after waiting for 2 hours. It's just good enough for me to have a look see at the beautiful arts in this museum. Furthermore it's free. I don't know how long the queues are on weekends but I suggest you go on a weekday. I love this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/averywildchild

50,Big and Unfinished,"Mr. Broad has put together a sizable collection in a fascinating building. It has many aspects to recommend it. However, we hope that as it ages, that it also creates a more compelling theme to follow...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bradp705
50,A Fun House Of Art,"About 100 years ago modern art began. And my interest in art fades. Anything really old could find a home in the Met or the Louvre and I would be OK with that, But new things I am not yet ready to give the black dot on white a place of honor. So when I had extra time at the Music Center before my performance start time I walked pass the Disney Hall and entered the Broad. What a rush it is to take the escalator to the 2nd floor and wow! A really big balloon dog greeted me. Koons I believe.A bright shiny blue child's toy make solid and gigantic. Looking a this big blue thing my reaction was to laugh. I felt wonderfully silly like a four year old. Here was art to share a laugh with. The sense of wimsey was patable. Gone was the morbid and profound statements over bits and pieces of recycled trash that the artist had so lovingly put in a new light. Mr Broad must have a enlarged funny bone and these visual jokes must have tickled him. While you or I might have a cartoon tacked up over our office computer rich people like Mr. Broad can find art that make them smile.""Art is either our passion or our addiction and I don't know which one perhaps both.""Eli Broad .How is your relationship with art going ?He likes art that plays the wolf in sheep's clothing. Soup cans that are way too big. Strange signs. Hidden messages hiding in plain sight. A fun house of distorted mirrors. Questions that have no answers and lots of bright shiny objects. I've been back several times just for the fun of it. Often enough to have favorites and have found a comfy seat where I can wait for everyone to make selections at the gift shop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/divagreta2016
50,Treat yourself!!!,"The Broad was a real treat to visit. We had purchased tickets, but ended up getting in a bit early. The staff at this museum was absolutely amazing. The friendliest and most informative I have ever encountered at a museum. Not only is the art collection a must see, but the building architecture is definitely something to study. Outside the building was a small grove of 100 year old olive trees. I was captivated by them.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/630CB
50,20th Century Art,"If you know about Warhol and Lichtensein, and are vaguely aware of world's best known graffiti artists, but want to expand your knowledge about contemporary art, this is the place to learn while being amazed at the huge and often zany pieces. Building architecture is also very 21st century. It fits in nicely with the Frank Gehry-designed Disney Conert Hall next doo.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ralyce
40,Long line,"The day we went we got there about 30 minutes prior to opening. The lined moved so unbelievably slow and after about 1 1/2 hours we got close enough to see why. The docent at the front door was letting one group at a time in and giving out information that should have been directed to the docents that were stinging inside the front hall, with nothing to do! She would then stop letting the non ticket holders in and let the people who I assume ordered tickets online with a preset time???? Not sure, but it was maddening waiting and frankly took away from the experience. By the time we got inside, we were so frustrated, it was going to be tough to enjoy it. Once inside it is quite open and not crowded at all. Make sure you go directly to the line to get a place to go into the exhibit of one million lights or something like that. It is worth the stupid way they let you in.....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DeanneI
50,Love it!,"We made reservations for the Broad (pronounced """"BROOD"") Museum and were glad we did as the standby line was long, really long. The building, itself if worth visiting even if contemporary art is not your 'thing'. We enjoy contemporary art and The Broad's collection is both large and interesting. Cannot pick a particular piece or room as the entire viewing experience is more important than seeing a particular Warhol or Lichtenstein.The museum is free, but reservations are absolutely necessary; at least that was our experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Irish_Harry
50,4th visit and I'm still loving it.,"Been here 4 times now and I still things I missed. Not a big museum, but a great collection of contemporary art! Warhol, Koons, Murakami, etc etc. Must make reservations for Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Light Room, and it's pretty cool.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tomasviska
50,Wonderful Art in a Wonderful Building,"The Broad collection is simply outstanding. While the building is really innovative, it doesn't detract from the art, but rather enhances it. The location, across the street from MOCA, allows you to visit two museums in one trip. The Broad Museum is free and you can get advance tickets online, which you should, because if you don't then you will stand on line in the hot LA sun for, what could be, hours. The natural light in the third floor galleries is amazing, and other museums could learn from the Broad in this regard. The collection is amazing and we are so fortunate that the Broads have decided to share it with the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YayaShare
50,Powerful without being overwhelming,I'm not a huge fan of contemporary art but this was the best experience I've ever had in a contemporary art museum anywhere. The architecture is stunning and powerful. The galleries are so bright and cheerful and the art has been wonderfully curated. It's a wide ranging collection of styles. Also powerful to look into their vault and see scores of art hanging on rolling racks. One of the best parts is riding the escalator up and walking down the stairs which overlooks the vault.Be sure to join their wifi when you arrive and download the free audio tour app. All museums should have free audio tours utilizing your cell phone. Bravo Broad.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hcmjkm

What fabulous art work.Got a ticket for Infinity too as I went at 11am - had to wait over 2 hours but was wise enough to go do the Self guided tour of Gehry Walt Disney auditoriumn across the road during that time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AMANBRAD

50,Breath of fresh air in downtown Los Angeles,"If you are able to plan this trip far in advance, it is smart to get tickets online. They are free and become available in 30-minute time slot increments on the 1st of every month at noon for the following month. I was able to get in pretty early on a Saturday, which I highly recommend.We parked in the lot beneath the museum. It was $12 and I'd say pretty worth it. When it is your time to go in, you just line up in front of the museum, they check your ticket and then you walk in. Right now, they have Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room on exhibit. You cannot sign up for this in advance, but when you walk in to the museum and line up directly to your left, you'll be able to sign up for a time slot. The mirrored room is incredible. When I went, they allowed you to go in by yourself or with one other person for 45 seconds. It's hard to capture how cool it is on your phone so I'd recommend going in and just taking it in, without using your phone.The collections in the rest of the museum are so refreshing. It is an amazing collection of modern art and just the right quantity of pieces. It's not too overwhelming and you can see everything in just a few hours, while taking your time. Just the architecture itself was art in its own right. The natural light coming in while we were there in the morning was so calming and peaceful.There is a small gift shop, but no cafe inside. There are trucks and small stands outside on the street. All-in-all, I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/allisong339
50,Great modern art collection,"The Broad is a fascinating museum featuring a variety of modern art pieces - sculpture to paintings - that challenge the visitor to think. From Warhol to Basquiat to Jasper Johns to Lichtenstein, and many others. A nice hour or two here is well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DenMarkster
50,Perfectly sized museum with great art,"I have been to art museums around the world and this one is one of the best for several reasons. First, the collection is very ""accessible"". You don't need to be an expert in modern art to appreciate this museum. They have a great free app you can download (free wifi at the museum so no need to plan ahead) that tells you about the pieces. Next, the building itself is beautiful. Third, the museum is FREE although parking was $22. You need at least an hour and a half to see the museum although we stayed for much longer. While it's great if you plan ahead and get tickets online, we did not. We waited about 35 minutes to get in (Thursday afternoon 3:30). Once inside go directly to the iPad in the lobby to sign up for a time to see Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. It will give you a reservation time to enter the room. Even if the iPad says there are no more reservations for the day, keep checking because there seem to be a lot of cancelations. We did this and got in. While we were waiting for our reservation time in the Infinity Room, we walked about 8 minutes down the hill to the Grand Central Market food hall - definitely worth the walk. I will recommend this museum to everyone I know who is going to LA. The generosity of the Broad family in making their impressive collection available to everyone is remarkable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jbienst

30,Free Museum!,"I love the area where the Broad is located, and I also love the fact that it is free. Having said that, I feel that the curators might actually consider the concept meritocracy when they display works of art, Color fields and pop art might impress the oligarchy crowd, but I want to see artists who actually have talent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/astridjj
50,Private Escape into Art,"The Broad is built like a very modern home. It is an art piece unto itself, even if the walls were blank.

40,Beautiful space,"I am not a big fan of modern art, so quite a few pieces went over my head, and were not fully appreciated. Lots of famous pieces, that you've seen in art books and design pamphlets. Visually entertaining. The building itself, is a amazing and the star in my eyes, viewed from both inside and out. Reservation are a must, to avoid insane lines snaking down the block. If you DO get a ticket, no need to show up at exactly that time. Wait about 15 minutes, and you'll get in with zero wait! If you can take the train in, you'll have a nice walk through downtown LA as well. It's a steep hilly walk from the 7th and Fig stop, but a good choice if it's not too hot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/808stays

There's a standby line that on the day we went didn't look that long. Luckily we were ushered right in. The control of traffic flow into the building really helps the experience of taking in all this marvelous art. One room was full of Harings and Basquiats! There's another room called the infinity room, which we were looking forward to seeing. You need a separate reservation for entry, on top of the reservation you make for the museum itself. We were told it would be a 3-4 hour wait. No thanks. Staff were also not the warmest, unlike folks I've encountered at places like the Whitney.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SilverlakeJake

Pre-booked our Infinity Room places and wandered off onto the third floor of the art museum.We spent just under an hour looking at the works, we were expecting more art pieces on the first floor but sadly that exhibition ended on March 16. Nevertheless, the Broad's collection is every contemporary art lover's dream. Jeff Koon's work was my favourite!The Infinity Room by Yayou Kusama was definitely a highlight! Well worth the wait. It's amazing how such a small room can make you feel part of a grand art piece. The website and brochure says each person (or pair) have one minute to spend in the room but we were only allowed 45 seconds. Take a quick picture or video and put the technology away and really enjoy the moment. It's awe-inspiring!My only tip is to pre-book your tickets a month or two in advance, it'll save you waiting around in the heat. If you can't get tickets, definitely just line up an hour before opening time, it's worth the wait since it is free anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/denyseee

As it was we turned up at 10.30 on a Tuesday morning for 11am opening and ended up queuing for an hour. Not too bad but ideally prebook. A note on parking, we parked in the California Plaza which the broad will give you a validation ticket to reduce to only $8 but remember where you parked! My fault but there are two different buildings and if I hadn't taken photos of the car park space, zone and level I don't think I ever would of found it again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauranada

50,Outstanding museum and important addition to LA cultural scene,"The Broad Museum has been open about 18 months now and it is absolutely outstanding. The quality of the art, the architecture of the building itself and the overall reception by the community of LA makes this a must see museum along with the Getty and LACMA.Highlighting the modern art The Broads feel in love with the artwork benefits from the custom design and layout to fit the specific pieces of art. There are many pieces that will seem familiar but others that will help expose visitors to artists they may not be familiar with.Plan your trip ahead, particularly with regard for getting tickets and then enjoy other elements of Downtown LA.

50,Amazing building housing awe inspiring art,"This is a spectacular museum. Make sure to reserve your tickets asap as they go fast (they open on the first of the preceding month). The infinity room is pretty cool also. The staff members are very helpful and knowledgeable. We spent about 1-2 hrs with the permanent collections. There were not any rotating collections while we were there, so I cannot comment on that aspect. At the very least, walk by this spectacular building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campbellc44
50,Fabulous Building. Fabulous Art.,"We visit LA every year to spend time with our son and his wife. I have tried to come here at least twice before and this year we finally lucked out. Admission is free with reserved tickets, which you can sign up for a month in advance. During the week is not a problem, so we planned our time with them around when they were working during the day. The line to enter, with no tickets was at least three blocks long, our admission ticket line, not even 50 feet. The art is all contemporary, some iconic and displayed well. And the building itself is amazing. A win-win!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/twomartinilunch
50,"Plan ahead, modern art lovers!","As others have mentioned, the most efficient way to see the museum is to reserve tickets a few months in advance. Weekdays are also easier to reserve on shorter notice. Even with advance tickets, you queue up outside, but in the line for your entry time. As others have noted, reserve early in the day if you want a chance at the special exhibit and go immediately to that queue. We had a 3 pm entry time and there were no more slots available that day. The collection is vast--you can peek at it from the second floor--but the current exhibits can be seen in about two hours. If you take the docent tour, he or she will explain select pieces in detail, but you'll quickly walk past all the others. Allow time to go back and see the pieces you missed. The docent explanations are worthwhile since they highlight things you might just gloss over. The parking garage underneath The Broad was almost full when we arrived and they were double parking some cars. Not sure how that worked, but there were several parking attendants. One noticed we were driving an electric car and said they had special parking for electrics, along with a cable to charge with. So we got a great spot near the exit. Before you leave the museum, make sure you get your parking validated in the gift shop--there was someone handing out validated cards that reduce the fee from $22 to $12. But our card didn't process correctly in the machine, and ours wasn't the only one. There is a button you can push and someone will come and replace your card so you get the reduced amount.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TooMuch2Do
50,"With smart planning, this was the perfect museum visit.","Some General Info: The Broad is an excellent museum and boasts a diverse and fascinating collection of contemporary art. My boyfriend and I (avid art lovers and frequent museum/gallery visitors) both agreed that this was our favorite of all the collections we had viewed together. The pieces are lovely and iconic, even the building itself is interesting. The number of persons allotted in is limited and this allows one to fully enjoy the museums bright and open layout. The collection is masterfully put together and admission is FREE! I highly recommend The Broad to any art lover.Planning Ahead is KEY: The Broad is currently a fashionable and highly sought after destination. That same limited entry that makes it so enjoyable, also means that general admission lines stretch around the outside of the building. My boyfriend and I arrived about 20 minutes before museum opening and the general line was already ridiculous. The Broad offers advance reservations that allow you to enter a limited queue and guarantees your entry at a specific time. This was great because it allowed us to breathe easy and KNOW we were getting in and also spared us the ""what if"" of the general line.The Infinity Room: The Infinity Room is a limited time installation that will be at The Broad until the fall of 2017. If you can get in, it is a MUST-SEE. The exhibit is stunning and intimate. Persons are allowed one minute enclosed in the piece and that minute feels more than worth it, as you take in what's around you. However, getting into the Infinity Room is quite difficult and also takes meticulous planning. Entry to the Infinity Room can only be obtained on site, at a kiosk in the museum's lobby. It is first come, first serve and you are placed in a virtual queue. When spaces fill up, they fill up, and the exhibit has been known to get totally booked up within two hours of the museum opening.For our visit, my boyfriend and I booked the earliest reservation for general museum entry and instantly made a beeline for the kiosk. Even with that quick admission, we still had an hour and a half to wait for our turn in the Infinity Room (this actually ended up working out great for us, because we got to see the rest of the museum and end our trip on a high note). But, as a cautionary tale, by the time we had seen the museum and had returned to the lobby to await our call, the wait time for those trying to enter had gone up to over 5 hours.Overall impressions: A fantastic place to visit but probably best to plan for it, in advance. It's too much of a hot spot for a drop-in, right now.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/813caitlink
30,"Not bad if you like ""conceptual-art"" if you wish to wait for one hour...","Cutting edge architecture makes this museum worth seeing. Eli Broad's money delivered something outstanding! I guess in terms of the pieces of art there, I must be too old, I don't know... I love 19-20th century art (from Brancusi, to Kandinski etc) but with conceptual art, I am a bit lost.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yakshaver
50,Pleasant Museum for Relaxing,"We toured The Broad last night. It was actually free-but parking is $12. It's worth it because parking on the street at night isn't easy. The museum itself is an architectural feat to see. Interesting lines and stairwells. They offer a current exhibit but have a collection that is their own. Third floor is the pernament collection-some well-known Andy Warhol pieces as well as Roy Lichtenstein and others. It's not a large museum. You can easily see all of the pieces and take time to appreciate them in around 2 hours. You do need a pass to get in, so make your online reservations prior to arriving at the museum. You will receive an email with a QR code for admission.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kbozeman78
40,"Book online in advance! Unique building, fascinating collection, $12 parking","The place was overrun by schoolchildren even before the official 11 a.m. opening time, but there were enough galleries to escape from the crowds. The building and collection are absolutely worth seeing. Get your entry ticket validated at the museum entry to reduce regular $22 parking fee to $12.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ccvvbb
40,"Modern, whimsical, impressive","There is a reason why the lines are long with people hoping to get in: this is a terrific place to visit in downtown Los Angeles.Tickets are free and if you plan in advance, you do not need to wait in line.The architecture of this museum is surprising, modern and quirky. I felt like I was in a creative and huge cave, full or art and wonder.The displays are unique and modern: some are abstract, some whimsical, and many are huge in scale. What a delightful collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/_Daphne1734
50,Amazing!,Beautiful looking building next to the Disney Centre. Amazing contemporary art collection. Entry is free but book a ticket online to avoid the longggggg standby queue.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/casuarina639
50,wow what a museum,we loved this museum. the exterior is outstanding from an architectural point of view. the museum is small enough to do in a couple of hours. the gift/book shop is interesting with lots to please all.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bonbonwalden
50,Favorite Contemporary/Modern Art Museum,"Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Room aside, which deserve a post of it's own because it's a mandatory to see, the museum was candy to my eyes. This is the sort of eclectic, though-provoking art I tend towards and The Broad did not disappoint. We got a tour guide mainly so we could see Kusama's Infinity Room, but our guide was excellent in giving us history and background on the exhibits. A particularly powerful piece was African't. It's been days since our visit and it's still on our minds. Next time I return it won't be under time constraints so I can stroll and savor because there are some real gems to discover here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pegc832
50,Definitely worth a visit,The Broad has an incredible collection of wonderful modern art! I walked in not expecting to be wowed as modern art is not my favorite but I was stunned by this collection! If you love any art you need to go,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dgflys
50,A great fairly new addition to the LA museum scene.,Fantastic building and the exhibitions upstairs are well worth the trip. You can make reservations in advance or wait in line. But if you decide to do the wait - get their early!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/1144Nana
50,Awesome Museum,A museum with an interesting collection of contemporary art. Some are quite elaborate and even huge. The cyclops is massive. See photo. It's free to enter. Do plan to stand in line with a reservation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dude_IN_LosAngeles
50,Excellent Modern Art,I have been to the Broad about 3-4 times in the past year. It is highly recommended. Exhibits change every three months. Great art. Always enjoyable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/854williamg
50,Cindy Sherman exhibition and the permanent collection,"My girlfriends and I celebrate our birthdays throughout the year with a museum visit and lunch, and our trip to the Broad was another delightful day of art and celebrating. The Cindy Sherman show was so beautifully curated, and so provocative, we spent quite a bit more time enjoying it than I had expected, and then had an amazing time seeing some of Mr. Broad's very fine permanent collection. I will look forward to the next show I get to view there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/elainesokoloff
50,A BIG WOW,"Such a delightful and uplifting way to spend a day. From A to Z, a most comprehensive panorama of modern art ranging from the political to the preposterous. Make sure you plan ahead to visit the Infinity Room. I must give a special nod to the staff members on each floor who provided insight and commentary after they observed what you were most interested in. The architecture is stunning...tons of light.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/penelopem593
40,"Great Museum, Long Line","We lined up 20 minutes before the museum opened on a Sunday and still ended up waiting 1.5 hours to get in. So, better to get tickets in advance.The collection is terrific and the space is well designed to showcase the art and keep people moving through without feeling too crowded. We really enjoyed our time there and would love to go back. The museum app has real promise but I wish it had more written information about the pieces on display -- reading up on the art we were about to see would have been a great thing to do while standing in line. Right now, the app only covers a handful of pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DawnM160
50,Quality contmporary art in a bustling location,"Went to the Broad Museum to see the spectacular Broad collection of modern art. The museum is free, but with timed entry, and was pretty crowded with lots of school kids. I am not a great fan of contemporary art, but this was as good as it gets....high quality examples from a wide range of (mostly US) artists. The layout was very well done, with great placement of connected artwork.Make sure you see the ""Infinity Lights"" special exhibit while there. It will be at the Broad until fall of this year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SteveandMolly
50,Love the Broad,"I was there in January and had to come back again, The Broad is the newest Museum in Downtown LA and it is Fantastic it is very busy but the rooms are large with high ceiling so you do not feel the crowd as much as other institution, the staffs are wonderful and full of informations to share if you need or very quiet if you are on your own journey, the Infinity room is wonderful you have to book your time as soon as you feet inside the Broad and they will text you when you need to get in the queue, the staff at the shop was so friendly and helpful as I was looking for specific Arts books I just love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maisoncote
50,A truly amazing museum,"The architecture is stunning and the spaces inside ideal for the display of art. The collection varies, but is always interesting.It's FREE, but you must make a reservation in advance or wait in long lines",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judithbT9365JV
40,Very nice museum-date,"My BF took me here for a Valentine's date and we had a great time :) I feel like we were able to see everything at a reasonable pace in about 4/5 hours. It's a nice collection, well laid out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/430medat
50,"Museum goers, Go!","This museum was excellent. I have to warn you, while it's free you will have to stand in a standby lane to receive your tickets, unless you reserve them online earlier (like a month earlier). I waited for roughly 25 minutes, which was not terrible. Once inside the museum you will see amazing pieces. The gift shop, which is small, is located as soon as you enter. It was a lovely afternoon spent in the city. The Broad is an incredible budget friendly activity, just try to enjoy the pieces.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LMPav
50,Exceptional Museum,"Walking into the Broad you are immediately confronted with a stack of giant plates that climb near the ceiling. The first of many extraordinary and interesting sites at the museum. Take the ""tunnel"" escalator to the upper floor (3rd floor) and you are immediately immersed in a wonder of contemporary art. The collections are organized by artist and as you wander from expansive room to room, you are struck by the beauty and grace of both the art and the building that houses it. The collections include paintings, photography, sculpture, multimedia, etc. The Broad must be experienced to be appreciated. Go! You will be happy you did. Parking is free in the lot under the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FriedomTrail
40,good location,"Located near city hall, MOCA, The Disney hall, and near a red line station. Catch a gold line and go to Chinatown (one stop north of union station) or little Tokyo (one stop south)Union Station is one red line stop from The Broad and about 100 ft from Olivera Street.You can reserve at time to get in line or you can take your chances.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dancenut449
50,Building as amazing as the art work,Really enjoyed the exhibit. Two particular rooms I could have stayed in for hours. As always some works not appreciated as much as is by others. Only need two hours. Need to make reservations weeks ahead or wait in a long line that frankly isnt worth it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrandmrsT84
50,Contemporary and eye popping,"The Broad is a must for anyone interested in contemporary art. It has a broad range of works by living artists. The building is a must see in and of itself The special exhibits are beautifully displayed and curated. The permanent collection is spread out and allows for excellent viewing. Timed entry means the galleries are never overfilled. Best of all, the walk down from the permanent collection has openings into the storage areas and give a glimpse into how museums store and move wrt work.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ronniekk
40,Crowded But Nice,"This is a relatively small collection, given the size of the building, which made it feel expansive and well-curated. Still a lot of people going (there was a line to get in, but only about 10 minutes). Really enjoyed my visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mapman62
50,Fantastic contemporary works,"Amazing collection, as well as the architecture itself...a bit claustrophobic on the main level, but once you get to the 2nd level there is a ton of energy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BLtrvl
40,The Broad,"The Broad is a new contemporary art museum built by Eli and Edythe Broad. We waited in line for one and a half hours to get in. Luckily the weather was in our favor. There are more than 2,000 works of art and they allow you to take pictures. You can not use your flashes or tripods. Museum closed on Mondays. I would allow yourself at least one hour to view museum. The architecture is amazing. Lots of gallery space and even the collection storage is visible. Getting reservations is advisable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSO70
30,Another excitiing building,Its a massive structure and you would love to see the architecture. We saw it during day as well as night as we were in downtown. Not far from Disney concert hall.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SanAsh
30,Long line,"I took 2 hours to line up with my friends. It is so long and time wasting. If you want to visit here, check online to see the date that you can order the ticket. Besides, inside is huge and beautiful. You can retrospect every art that you have seen in your art textbook. The famous one is Andy Warhol. His art is on third floor. The others are also good. Looking at some interesting and hilarious artwork is a kind of great experience. But If I can, I won't line up so long for this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LANCEofTAIWAN
50,Every Piece worth seeing,"The Broad collection is incredible. For anyone who enjoys modern art, it is a must see. The staff regulates the flow of people so there's no overcrowding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/100SusanM
50,Must Visit,"The art on display may or may not be interesting depending on what is on display, but the building will always be a marvel to look at and feel... Yes, touch the smooth walls as you escalate to the second level. Don't forget to take the stairs and take a peek in the vault. At The Broad, the storing of art is a work of art in itself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ricardo-olvera
50,Wow,"Both the architecture and the exhibits are fascinating. The space is open and can accommodate very large pieces easily. Even on a busy day it didn't feel crowded. I guess you would call the art modern/eclectic.And it's FREE. If you park in the lot, get your ticket validated before you leave the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cheryl90
50,An Amazing Modern Art Museum,This is a beautifully designed museum housing outstanding modern art and the entrance is free to the public. I highly recommend first attending the movie about the Broad family to learn about their interest in art and the collection and then touring each floor of the museum. The selection of art is tasteful and iconic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/monicahV2625LC
40,Reserve free tickets in advance,"The biggest tip - plan ahead, go online and reserve your tickets in advance- this makes it so much easier! The standby line is wrapped around the building!! Plenty of parking for $8-$12 around the museum so don't worry about parking! There are food trucks and food vendors outside the museum as well if you get hungry. You also need to go early if you want to do the first floor room ""infinity mirrored room"" experience as it's first come first serve - we did not get to do this bc it was full! The museum is very unique and a fun outing while in LA! Lots of Instagram worthy photos to be had here! We spent 2 hours there and then went to eat at Bottega Louie just down Grand Ave (you have to drive & re park or Uber & keep parking space by Broad).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sparky8188
50,something for everyone,fantastic contemporary art museum with something for everyone. Just make sure you book on line in advance or else you will be spending most of the day waiting in line outside. Great art work - a lot of unusual & funky pieces. Adults & kids will relate differentlyafter you finish walk on down to city hall (about 10 minutes) & go up to level 27 to the observation deck. Great 360 degree views all over los angeles. It's free & the best view in town. Just make sure that someone in your group has photo id,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shelkar

40,"Beatiful, new modern art museum","As every museum of modern art, you'll find some pieces of questionable value... The building itself is beautiful, and it makes the visit worth it...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NelsonPirolo
40,Check out the building as much as the art,"Given the impossibility of getting reserved tickets , we had to see it we could get into this place by waiting in line. The twitter feed is a godsend for figuring out how long the wait might be, but once you get in, the building is just as interesting as the art.It is worth the trip - not quite on the level of the Guggenheim, Barnes, or Philadelphia museum of art, but still interesting. Check it out. It's free!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/orthobass
40,The new kid in town.,"There is a lot of buzz about The Broad, the striking new museum in Downtown LA that houses Eli Broad's collection of cont mostly late 20th century art. It demonstrates that if you have a ton of money, you can buy a nice bunch of paintings. However, I just didn't move me much. I did like the Kelly room, though; the lighting and mounting make his works come alive in a way I had not seen in other museums. In addition to the Kelly, I thought Takashi Murakami's, In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow, was fascinating. When combined with lunch at Otium, it makes for a pleasant afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnN121
50,Small-ish museum with a very nice collection,"It's my 2nd visit to the Broad. I was quite impressed by the space the last time I visited in December 2016–I love the escalator ride up to the 3rd floor, it's like being in a museum 'Disneyland'! Very playful surroundings, walls and ceilings are curved, not angled.The Broad's collection is quite eclectic and seems vast. The visit can be a quick one, it's not very large and is a comfortable 1–1.5 hour experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/little_traveller
50,Exceptional,The Broad's permanent collection on the 3rd floor does not disappoint. Crowds on the weekend may be overwhelming. Don't miss it!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beanie88
50,A must see Museum!,A spectacular museum both inside and out. Wonderful architecture and a fabulous collection of modern art. Don't miss this museum whether you live in LA or you are visiting. Great restaurants too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanetR822
30,A nice little modern museum.,"The museums is small but it has a nice collections of the great modern artist. The parking below is $20 but you can get it validated at the entrance to be $12. But the validation is only good for a couple of hours, so read the sign as you exit the parking lot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/siouxsy
50,Don't miss this museum!,"Whether you like contemporary art or not, this museum is not to be missed.If you DO like contemporary art, you're in for a treat, with its amazing collection and special exhibitions. There's a good balance between styles and artists, and the staff is ready to explain the pieces/artists' works in each room.If you do not like -or don't know if you do!-, it's still a great place to visit. The architecture of the museum alone is pretty amazing. Just walking around and observing the way it's all set up and the structure (inside and outside) is enough to make it worth a visit. Plus, you can then walk around and see the architecture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Dorothy Chandler (LA Opera), etc. So, it's a nice architectural walk that takes less than an hour ;)The museum is FREE!!! You do need to reserve tickets online (for a specific day and time Tues-Sun)... OR, you can just get there and get on the stand-by line. Weekends are -of course- more crowded, but not impossible to get in; weekdays are much easier -I've been there on Thursday afternoons and the stand-by wait has been about 5-10mins (plus, MOCA is across the street and free from 5-8pm on Thurs... so, the perfect combo!).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yayras
50,A great addition to the LA Museum scene,"Tickets to the Broad are free but you have to reserve ahead of time and it is popular! The building is a great piece of modern architecture and easy to maneuver. The permanent collection is quite good - Basquiat, Warhol, the usual contemporary suspects. The restaurant next door -- Otium -- is fabulous!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/barbaraoF1556RK
50,Evening at the broad!,"""The souls of millions of light years away"" was the best. 189 minutes of waiting for 45 seconds of the display was totally worth it! Enjoyed the giant's dining table too! Highly recommend this museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/moomroosan
50,Excellent Modern Art Exhibits and Experience,"Coworker and I had a great experience visiting the Broad. We originally checked on reserving tickets before flying to LA, but tickets weren't available. We checked again once we landed and were able to reserve 2 tickets for 5:30 pm. Our next goal was to be able to see Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. Upon arriving, the exhibit was booked for the night. However, one of the awesome musuem staff members told us to double check, because spaces open if people cancel their reservation. After experiencing all the amazing artwork, we were able to make the list to see the Infinity Room. You only get 45 seconds to stand there, but it is easy to totally relax and be lost in Infinity for those few seconds. One of the better art musuems that I have visited. Highly recommend for this who enjoy something different.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josho1981
50,A great contemporary art museum,"We had some free tickets, which we were lucky to get, in advance. They were for a specific time, so our wait was fairly short. There are works by Basquiat, Twombly, Jasper Johns and many other contemporary artists. I'm no art connoisseur, but, I recognize many of the artists works. I liked a lot of the painting and graphics and others are just weird. It is a place we will have to go back to with a little more preparation in art appreciation. They have rotating exhibits, so, there may be different works next time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mazuza2
50,"Modern, hip new museum",Interesting mix of modern art at this new museum. Admission is free and I recommend making your online reservation one month in advance. Book an earlier time slot since it is not busy early in the day but gets crowded later in the afternoon. As soon as you get in make your scheduled reservation for the private Infinity Room which is worth the wait. Friendly staff is helpful and go out of their way to answer your questions.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Susan90405
30,Wouldn't Wait in Line,"A friend (much more schooled in modern art than I) and I made reservations for The Broad recently. The reservations process was easy, our time was honored on the dot and we entered the museum with great anticipation. Sadly, we were both disappointed and made the rounds of the exhibits quickly. We had a difference of opinion on the first impressions. The grey, rounded, cave-like architecture that divided the space was surprising. My friend didn't find it off-putting but I couldn't help but be reminded of a paleo cafe I had dined at in Arizona. It had a little Flintstone feeling toit. the entry gave way to large spaces filled with large art. The day we were there the theme seemed to be savagery. I actually am drawn to such themes in my readings and certainly appreciated certain exhibits - the red severed and shriveled body was actually quite beautiful, the painting of one fo the WWII death camps was sobering. But the four torture canvases which were almost the first thing to be seen set a tone that seemed to be more in your face than reflective, artistic exploration. I loved the Koontz exhibits, certainly a welcome bright spot. Also enjoyed the paintings that took their cue from the Day of the Dead traditions. The gift shop definitely had a fun edge to it - skateboards and outdoor chairs were really great. Unfortunately every time I got my hopes up that I would see something really unique and different, they were dashed. One bright spot - take the stairs from the third floor exhibit (why did they put administrative offices on 2?) and you can look through a stairwell window into the full collection storage area. That was awesome as was the elevator. All in all, glad we had tickets, I would have been very disappointed had we waited an hour in line, and I probalby won't go back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RebeccaForster
40,Recommend a visit!,"First off, you can't beat the price of FREE. You do have to get tix online in advance due to the high demand of the new museum, but that saves you the hassle of waiting in the standby line. We did not get to see the ""room of lights"" since it was a 7 hour wait when we arrived at our 1:00 time slot. However, still plenty to see in here.We spent a little under 2 hours exploring the 2 story museum, starting at the top and working down. The lines outside were long, but inside didn't seem too bad. I'm more of a science museum kinda guy but still enjoyed all the unique modern pieces in here. The table and chairs was probably my favorite. Overall a pretty fun thing to do if you are in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y8983VPtimothym
50,The Broad LA,"We prebooked our visit for 4pm did not realise that The Broad closed at 5pm we should have checked. I had travelled from UK my friend lives in LA do she said she would queue to add our names to visit infinity room....unfortunately she queued for 40 minutes now 4.50pm and the closed the line just as she was about to register. She joined us by Michael and Bubbles to be told they were closing. The gallery is amazing staff were on the whole friendly and helpful the exhibits are out of this world. If you plan to visit The Broad book to go around lunch time. Its going to take an hour to register if you want to visit infinity which I really was looking forward too, and you probably need 2 hours at least to see all exhibits. There are some really good food outlets outside to get food and drink from.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trippers666
50,amazing,"Plan ahead to avoid long lines but if not, it's still worth the wait. The collection and staff are fantastic. Be prepared to be blown away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/X8664ZIjanetl
50,Don't miss the Infinity Mirrored Room,"The Broad is worth the trip to downtown LA for its ""vault and veil"" architecture alone. It's situated immediately next door to Gehry's Concert Hall and holds its own ... almost. The art collection was an enlivening combination but the highlight was undoubtedly Yayoi Kusama's ""Infinity Mirrored Room"". The couple in line before us was allowed slightly longer in this marvellous installation for a marriage proposal. Those not tying the knot get a mere 45 seconds of magical solitude. Well worth the wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Happytravellerabc
50,So cool,3 levels of inspiring art. One of the most photographed and instragramed places in LA is definitely worth a visit. I have a heap of photos but this stupid app won't let me upload them. Booooo. The broad has a 3month waiting list. If ur heading over jump on their website and pre book a ticket. So exhibits are really thought provoking others are just fun. Good for the whole family. Make sure you check out the infinity room.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/98sarahc
50,Best Contemporary Art Museum I have been too.,Generally speaking I find contemporary art to have a high percentage of pretentious nonsense. The Broad had much less of this than the many other contemporary art museums I have been in around the world. Great collection by Jeff Koons is a highlight as well as the design of the building itself. Be prepared to wait but it is free to get in. I waited about 45 minutes you can also get tickets online. They keep it less crowded though and it was quite enjoyable to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JKPImageFusion
40,Compact but colorful!,"incredible building, incredible collection but definitely reserve tickets in advance - we arrived at our scheduled time of midday on a rainy day to see there was STILL a huge line wrapping around the building: rain be damned!and if you want to see the infinity room, reserve tickets for early in the day! at 12pm the wait for the infinity room was 4.5 hours and with a 10 year old companion in tow that just wasn't going to happen. oh well, next time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PvrlGirl
50,Great Day,"We booked tickets in advance (around a month i think) which i would recommend to guarantee you entry.Overall we both had a great day exploring the different galleries.

Great food and service!Parking wasn't too expensive for central LA. And it was secure",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rebrob1234
40,"Wonderful Staff, Interesting Art","My wife and I arrived early for our 2:30 appointment. The people managing the entrance were very helpful and courteous and let us in with the 1:30 group. Those inside the museum were also friendly and knowledgeable. The art was ""old school"" modern and interesting to look at. Nothing spectacular. We were very pleased that it was free. We will return for new exhibits. Beautiful facility.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tapetseb22
50,A Must See Museum,"I've visited museums that have collections from classic greek to modern art, and this is clearly a memorable museum with a superb collection. You have to plan ahead to reserve free tickets, so don't just show up. Park in the lot underneath the museum, have lunch at Otium next door and have a great time seeing the exhibit. There is a huge collection so don't forget to walk down the stairs and get a glimpse of what is not on display. While a couple of the negative reviews didn't like modern art, I would beg to differ. This is a delightfully entertaining exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mntraveler35
50,Amazing,"I didn't reserve a ticket in advance and arrived at the museum half an hour before opening (11:00 am). Luckily, the line up for standby tickets was short and I got in within 40 minutes....and it's FREE!The architecture of the building is very modern and the exhibition rooms give the visitors enough space to admire the pieces of art.I feel very privileged that I got the chance to experience the ""Infinity miror room"" by Yayoi Kusama.If you are Downtown LA, this is a must see. And moreover it's located next to LAPhil (Walt Disney concert hall), which is an architectural wonder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lemmo26
40,Modern Art Day,"Stopped by here with the kids for a taste of modern art versus the classical art we had seen the weekend previous. Nice facility, crazy good sculptures.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaribbeanFan79
40,Very much worth a visit,"If you like modern art, you'll like The Broad. The Broad houses the private collection of the Broad family. The collection is very impressive - but having seen modern art many places it seems to me that the building is the star attraction. A beautiful structure that is well designed to its purpose, both is a presence you enjoy and works to showcase what it contains.Very well run with a helpful staff that recently started doing ""pop-up lectures"" where they just come and start explaining a work or an artist. I think that's a GREAT idea and will make the art more accessible to more people - which is, after all, what a museum should do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N7615BZericw
50,Very interesting artworks,"Located adjacent to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra Building & Disney Hall, The Broad Gallery has a distinct architectural style. Entry is gained by one of two ways - book online or wait in queue. Both are free but waiting in queue can take a while at times. Greeted by a spacious entry, there is a shop near the exit & some small display areas on the ground floor. A long escalator takes visitors to the main gallery display areas. These are many & varied. Artworks large & small adorn almost every possible space. An interesting stairway takes visitors back to the ground floor. Elevators are available if required. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravellingManOz
40,The line is very long,"I went there in the beginning of January. I go there at 11am which is when it opens and the line was already very long. I waited 3 hours to get into the museum. It took me about an hour and little bit to walk around inside. For the infinity room, I waited for another 2 hours. It was a long wait and you can only be inside for 45 second. At the moment, it felt amazing to be in that room. However, think back now I would not wait for 5 hours for that exhibition if I had anything better to do that day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yiw483
50,The Broad- The Must See!!,"Highly recommended!!For an adventure and a worth of your day..We went for a walk in, No reservations.on a Sunday noon... it wasn't bad. The wait was 10mins...Parking in the same structure is $12.Food or bottle water Not allowed.But, reserve your cravings for the Food Trucks outside and the Cafe and 2 great Restaurant across the Lawn.BUT IF U REALLY WANT TO SEE THE """" INFINITY MIRRORED ROOM"""" you have to make an advance reservations.We missed it.. was ok.But the whole experience, was great.For No fee to get in?..>> YEAH!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chaig33
50,A long waited wishlist now completed,"I finally made a reservation online for me and my husband for 12:30 Tuesday. When we were inside, we got to sign up for the mirror room viewing and what we got was around 3:40. It took us about one and half hours to look around the exhibition. We tried to find a place to take a break on a cup of coffee because we had to wait another hour to see the mirror room. Unfortunately, however, there was no cafe inside. I was convinced by my husband to save the mirror room for next time because I was sure we would definitely come back for it soon. This place is a must in a tripto Los Angeles!Tips for the mirror room: If you enter the museum in the head of the line and go to the sign-up kiosk immediately as you enter, I think you can shorten your wait time for it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jayomma
50,a MUST in LA,"It is a must in LA, i highly recommend booking in advance to skip the 2hr line, at the time it was free entrance, beautiful art collection, at the moment there was an incredible Jeff Koons sculptures, and of course the highlight the ""infinity room"" amazing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Emenemer
40,Another great spot to visit in DTLA (downtown LA)!,"Things are changing in DTLA.. Lots of new restaurants and, The Broad! We enjoyed our visit here and feel it is a great addition to our city. The price is right, FREE! But make reservations. It is New and very popular.Whike downtown you might also enjoy Grand Central Market and Botega Louie.DTLA is becoming a fun destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzanneHolmerSmith
50,A Fun Time at The Museum,"We had a wonderful time at The Broad. If you do not have tickets, be advised to arrive well before the museum opening. The tickets, which are free, can be obtained a few months(?) prior to attending. We went on Saturday, 1/14, and got there at 10am (when the museum opens)...and had to wait 2 hours to get in. We were with some people that were from out of town, so while one of us stayed in line, the others went and explored the Disney Concert Hall & gardens, MOCA, and the Colburn School of Performing Arts.When the time came to enter, we immediately went to get reservations to see the Infinity Room (the first available time was 6 hours from the time of our entry)...the wait was not that long, we were sent a text after 3 1/2 hours telling us we were 35th in line. We were hungry, so we went off to eat lunch. Once you get in, you are given tickets that allows you to enter and exit the museum. Coming back in after our lunch, we viewed all of the exhibits. The Infinity Room was well worth the wait. Though you are only allowed 45 seconds in the room, the time seems a lot longer.The Murakami Exhibit was wonderful as well. You can see the entire museum in about 2 hours, but I would allow more time to enjoy the art that is displayed. The next time I go, I think I will get the guide. There are plenty of staff on hand to talk to you about the art.All in all, well worth the wait. Oh by the way, they offer validated parking at the museum, but I think that the parking is free on the weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pmlk82212
50,The Broad,Do not miss The Broad on your visit to LA. Amazing collection! Book ahead and reserve tickets when the museum opens so you can get reservations to see Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room before the day's reservations close. Park in the building lot when you visit the museum is $12 for 3 hours with validation. Same day entry available but there's a long wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tahoe_Memories
40,Great Space Great or at least Interesting Art,Definityly worth going but try and reserve the free tickets. You can get in standing in line but it is L.A. and you will be subjected to conversations about agents and dropping albums and such.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colliegirl101
40,"Intriguing Building, Incoherent Collection","The facade of the Board Museum is certainly one of the more interesting facades of the past few years, which is a requirement given that its neighbor is the Disney Concert Hall. But, as visitors walk under the Upper Grand facade it becomes apparent that the facade - while truly unique - is simply a box encased by a decorative veil; an illusion.This illusion than transpires into the collection that is at times incoherent in relation of one theme to the next. The modern collection is unique, but the curation of the work and overriding theme (if any) is missing.Reserve your spot in advance for *free* admission and plan on spending 1-1.5 hours. If you don't have a reservation, the Will Call line typically stretches around the side of the building and can last hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/McPhisto76

50,A MUST see.,"One of the best contemporary art museums on the planet is now in downtown Los Angeles and it's FREE. The building architecture, the collection, the neighborhood... I am from Los Angeles and I can honestly say this is one of our treasures. You will rarely find a staff more excited about the art being displayed because instead of ""guards"" or ""security"" you have artist and art history majors interacting with anyone that is curious. The lines can be ridiculous so please plan in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AngelAwakened
50,The Best,"Honestly the best museum I've been to in a long time and a stand out of my trip to LA.Really well organised, with lovely members of staff. The queue, and need to book tickets in advance is beneficial as when you get in, it's not over crowded and you can really enjoy the experience. The building from the outside is impressed, and it only continues to impress once you get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yesjamie
50,"Amazing Architecture, Whimsical Collection","What a wonderful gem of a museum! The admission is free, but you do need to reserve in advance for a specific time and date, or you have to stand in line. We were fortunate to be able to visit this museum because one of the docents was able to bring us in as friends. I'm not a big modern art fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and the collections on display. The architecture is wonderful! Looking through the windows towards the cathedral and Walt Disney Concert Hall is great for taking pictures. Los Angeles has really changed since I lived there in the 1980's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VicksVaporRub
50,"Exterior Keys off Gehry, interior inventive, collection great","The philanthropist and collector Eli Broad did a great service putting up this museum. Fine contemporary collection. Inventive interior design, as you go down from the third level by stairway, windows open onto the storage area where more paintings reside -- interesting.

50,Great art in a great building,"Admission is free, but be sure to reserve well in advance or you'll end up waiting outside on a stand-by line. Once inside, go right away to sign up for the mirror room because only one or two people can enter that room at a time and not everybody gets to go inside. That experience is limited to one minute, but it's worth it. The museum visit can take as long as you want and there's lots of wonderful contemporary art to enjoy. We saw everything in just over an hour and then went to the mirror room. Even if you don't get inside to see the art, it's worth seeing the exterior of the building for its extraordinary architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Dobbstraveler

The collection of contemporary art by Edythe and Eli Broad is impressive and important. This is a jewel for downtown Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ArthurH741
10,Venue on tour,This is a very very modern contemporary Museum. Most of the people on our two groups were in their 60s 70s and 80s and it was way too modern for us to enjoy. We just don't understand modern Art. I would not go back,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gida64

40,Solid Tier 2 Contemporary,LA still lacks a world class MOMA like NY and SF. But this is free and close to other downtown LA sites. Small enough to see in 1 hour or less.

50,A great contemporary art museum for everyone.,"I took my family to this museum on New Year's Day. It was a last minute decision, we did not have a chance to reserve the tickets. This resulted a wait for a little over an hour. Yes, it is a long wait, but it was worth it. Here is why:1. The museum is located in an area where the surrounding buildings can be a view just by itself. The Museum's architecture was very artistic, the Walt Disney Concert Hall next door is also an amazing structure. While we waited, we took pictures of the buildings, the streets, the scene, that helped to kill the time. Plus there are food trucks in front of the museum, multiple of them! Then it's hardly a wait. ;)2. It is absolutely free! Without any kind of memberships, or coupons, it's JUST FREE. This is an perfect price if parents want to introduce art to their children without feeling pinched in their wallet. And if children show absolutely no interest in art whatsoever, you can still say to yourself: good thing I didn't pay for it. :)3. Although it's free, but the collection in the museum is very impressive. I am not an artist, and I have to admit that I did not quite get many pieces in the museum. But there is a good mix of art pieces that an average person like me did not feel boring at all and I actually really enjoyed it. And some sculptures that even my 4 and 6 year old like as well. (though not that many)Okay, now to the words of advice. If you can, still try to reserve the tickets, especially to the infinity mirror room. We couldn't get into the infinity mirror room due to no reservation and late hours. But we enjoyed the museum so much that we decided to come back later when we can make the reservation.Also, even though I took my kids with me, but I am going back without them. Younger children does not have the capacity to read the introduction and labels of the art pieces, so they will become impatient. Even though the sculptures will keep them entertained, but if you want to thoroughly enjoy the museum, go without them. My 11 yr old did great, and enjoyed the museum as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/522tracyw
40,Worth the wait,"Was in town to visit family, and needed time to kill while they worked. The trip was last-minute, so I wasn't able to sign up for the VIP entry. Arrived at 10:20 am, and was admitted at 1:30 pm.The collection was worth the wait, as it's a great mix of current avant-garde pieces and 'relatively' old mastersl Photos are permitted without flash, so you are able to document pieces you've always or didn't know you always wanted to see. As the staff doesn't allow excessive entry, there is ample room to wander at your leisure. It was also encouraging to see a range of ages, however many of the families were foreign visitors, which is less so.Altogether I spent about 5 hours of my day here - not bad, but as entry is at 11 am, if you are stand-by and you wait, you've killed your day. As it was a rare rainy day when I visited (stopped shortly after I arrived thank goodness!) I had the time, so it was a win.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bethr2126
40,Impressive collection,We did not make reservations. The long queue that wrapped around the building looked intimidating. We stood in line for about two and a half hours before setting foot inside finally at around 12:30. They provided umbrellas for UV protection during the wait and there were plenty of vendors selling cold beverages to help kill thirst and boredom. The modern art exhibits inside did not disappoint and were certainly worth the wait. For the uninitiated some artwork pieces like those by Warhol were familiar but there were delightful surprises around every corner; like Valsman's Untitled Turkey. This is a dynamic collection of contemporary artwork indeed. Overall it was an interesting hour of visual entertainment. A minor note: the first restroom at the museum entrance has only a single urinal and one stall - for long line of visitors some who have wait in line outside for several hours.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LnS2004
40,"""If you like Contemporary Art, this is your Museum""","The type of art displayed at the Broad is just not my cup of tea. Let's get that out of the way upfront. Modern Art to me appears like a kindergartener beginning to draw, is that really art? Despite this, the Broad is a beautiful building inside and out. Begin your tour on the third floor taking the long escalator up from the first floor. Best exhibit now is Andy Warhol's art. Walk the entire third floor. Take the stairs down to the second floor which is the storage and administration floor. Interesting how they store the art to be displayed. Next, tour the first floor. Current Exhibit is Creatures. Check when you first arrive if you can see the ""Infinity Mirror Room"". We could not at our late hour, already sold out. Located across the street from the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a much better venue to tour in my opinion. Stunning is the Disney.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shuttrrbug
40,Am I the only one who doesn't go crazy over modern art?,"OK first a disclaimer. Despite two art degrees, modern art just isn't my thing. So I was bored.

50,Contemporary Art and Architecture!,"Since it is so new, the Broad is always crowded - which is great for downtown LA! Not so great if you didn't plan a visit - easy to do by booking on line for a special exhibition. The art is maybe too contemporary for any concrete art books explanations, but very enjoyable to roam the galleries and discover concepts on your own.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pw65_12
40,It's a terrific building from the inside...worth an hour's visit,"I've never been much of an abstract art fan...I suggest at least half of this art will be in some laughable junk pile in a hundred years. That said, the Broad still had many interesting and iconic pieces I found engaging. Your mileage may vary. It was worth an hour. Oh...I need to tack on the terrific 45 seconds I had in the Infinity Room! About the building: I found its interior much more fascinating than its exterior...it's an amazing light-filled floating enclosure (versus its boring exterior). Note that The Broad is easily accessible via public transportation.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLVAGUY
30,Didn't get it,"I know it is exceptional based on all the people in line. My wife is an interior designer and loves art. I warned her I would rather be watching re-runs of a 1942 chess tournament. That said, I walked into one room and saw this art display of a broom and a squeegee leaning against a wall. People were gazing at it like it was a sculpture by Michelangelo. I personally have seen better displays of brooms at Ace Hardware. I do think it is worthwhile to visit this museum unless of course you can still get a seat at that chess tournament",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/B832MGroberth
50,Wonderful American collection,"This is an excellent museum. Be sure to get tickets for the Infiinity room Long lines and only about a minute to spend there. The Broads collection of Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Michel Basquiat and other American artists is noteworthy.

We visited December 15 and reserved tickets 5-6 weeks prior visiting. When you get in, make sure you waitlist for the Infinity Room. When we arrived at 1 PM, the wait was estimated to be 4.5 hours but we ended up getting in after 2.5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/matt2lee

50,The New Art Museum in LA,In order to go to see the collection you have to either sign up for tickets ahead of time on line or be prepared to wait. But it's a scene and the collection has some items that are worth waiting for. Alas it is VERY well organized and the people who work there are knowledgeable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RKZ90027
50,Lovely Free Museum,"I've been here twice now and I really enjoy this museum. The Broad has a very impressive collection! Before I go any further, let's address the pronunciation. Broad museum is named for the Broad family are art enthusiasts, who have created the museum and filled it with their expansive collection. Broad is pronounced like Ode with a B in front, not like Broadway or Broad City. :DAs other reviewers have mentioned, the museum is free to visit. But this means a line begins forming an hour before they open, or longer on weekends. You can beat the lines by reserving tickets online, and then you stand in a much shorter line that moves in every 30 minutes. I advise reserving a ticket for the first available time (10 on weekends or 11 on weekdays) because a major attraction in the Broad has a separate waiting list inside and you'll not want to miss it.The Infinity Room is definitely the biggest attraction in the Broad, and it is a simple but beautiful installation. To view it, you should sign in immediately upon entering the museum by adding your name on the tablet located on your left. This will allow you to walk around the museum while you wait for the text message notifying you when it's your turn to view the Infinity Room.Upstairs in the museum, they have art pieces very familiar to almost anyone. There are pieces by Warhol, Basquiat, Koons, and other artists whose work is recognizable to those of us without an art degree. Many of the pieces are large and engaging- and therefor very Instagram-friendly. The first floor is reserved for the rotating collections, and might be closed if it's between the scheduled featured collections. But to reiterate: it is free.What is not free is the parking, which we paid $22 for the whole day. This isn't terribly bad considering it amounts to $11 each for parking and the museum. Also, the gift shop has a nice but pricey selection of $60 Warhol Campbell's Soup candles and Where's Warhol kids books. I anticipate coming back to check out the new exhibits here, and spend 45 more seconds in the Infinity Room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/52sandyw
50,The best modern art museum in LA,"I really like visiting modern art museums. However, didn't expect much after visiting MOCA. Well, it definitely worth visiting. I would even recommend skipping MOCA to spend more time at the Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clandestin
50,Excellent Art Museum,"The Broad is an excellent art museum that can be visited in 2-3 hours. The art is all contemporary art from the private collection of Eli Broad and his wife. The museum itself is architecturally interesting especially the escalator to the third floor exhibit space. The galleries are located of the first and third floors. The galleries are spacious with more than adequate space for viewing the art. Admission is free but advanced, timed tickets are strongly recommended.

50,Truly incredible but don't waste time if you are in town for a few days only,"That was my 4th visit. Don't go on Mondays and 30mins before they close. Best is to get there early and sign up for the infinite mirror room immediately. Tip: you can have a reservation to the museum but not to the infinite room. My reservation was at 12:30 the wait for the infinite room that time was 170 mins. I got in around 3pm. It's beautiful but you only get 60sec or less. If you are visiting for a short period of time I wouldn't recommend this unless it's raining outside. The rest of the artworks are pretty cool as well. Check out Double America, the blue dog and the colorful mirror candy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judyblonde86
50,Modern Art Inside & Out,"This museum of modern art is intriguing. From its architectural honeycomb design using natural light to the vast openness of space showcasing Ely Broad's personal art collection.The museum is free but tickets are required as the number of visitors at one time is controlled.There is art works by Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, Ellsworth Kelly and Roy Lichtenstein. Fun balloon-like sculptures by Jeff Noons. I also liked numerous pieces by lesser known artists on display.I thoroughly enjoyed the modernization that Malcolm Morley did to the famous Vermeer ""The Art of Painting"" and Roy Lichtenstein did in honoring Monet's ""Rouen Cathedral"" series.It is also worth waiting on the line for Yayoi Kusama's, Infinity Mirrored Room.You are invited to be enveloped into the room one person at a time or as a couple.Mix the brilliant simplicity of mirrors, water, colored light bulbs and a dark enclosed room and you get magical infinity!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdS67
50,Absolutely Wonderful Collection in a Strange Building!,"The Broad family have been so very generous in sharing their art collection that to complain about the building's design seems unfair. It was, to me, three buildings that had little to do with each other. The exterior cage, cast and patterned is seen inside rarely. Only in the front of the entry lobby and in a little piece of the upper gallery do you sense all the work done to create a 'unique' skin. The lobby is a cave. Why? Another precious statement. The top floor galleries work fine, and the ceiling is excellent for light, but it's another building. They call the middle""The Vault"" which hold the part of the collection not on display. But why it had to be encased as part of the cave is another architectural vanity piece.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JimFHouston
50,We stood in line for 3 hours,"Get tickets online. That is a must. But the museum has wonderful artwork. The Broads concentrated on paintings, so there are few sculptures, prints or photos.

Parking is expensive, but the museum is free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/512candyn
40,Accessible contemporary art,"The Broad houses one of the largest contemporary art collections I've seen. The building, itself, is an art piece. Although not a connoisseur of modern art, I found the diversity of the collection engaging. There are associates in each room to assist, but there are informational plaques for each piece.The Infinity Room is in high demand, as evidenced by the long line up for a 45-second stint n the room. I didn't partake on this visit, but you must sign up for the waiting list for your turn in the room.Broad tickets are free, but you must book on-line - one month in advance is recommended. Mondays, the museum is closed.If you take a walk around The Broad, you can also take in the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagittarianTraveller

40,Who knew museums could be so busy?,"Be prepared to stand in line when you arrive but you can avoid it by getting tickets online which I wish I knew prior to coming here. I've been twice and each time there has been a long line ahead of the entrance as well as when trying to get into the Infinity Mirrored Room. When you arrive make sure to sign up for it first thing and if it's a big reason for going, check what time it closes so you can guarantee a view.The museum itself is pretty big and has a lot of installations which draw a big crowd so be prepared to bump into people. One of my favorite pieces is the oversized table and chairs that give you a different perspective of an everyday item and always make people smile every time I've gone.Much like a lot of attractions in Downtown LA, parking is a nightmare but don't let that discourage you from visiting this awesome museum. The Jeff Koons installations are also quite memorable so be sure to walk around and really check them out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VivienM593
40,Nice place to see,"First of all, entrance is free... I think I haven't been there in a while. But once you get your ticket and they let you in you can't go back out. There's an indoor bathroom, but i had to go to the bathroom when my dad, sister and I were outside( great timing); we went inside and a lady who worked there told me that I couldn't use the restroom once outside. A little weird but that didn't stop me from enjoying some of the artwork. Also if you have children that are well behaved (or at least listen to you a little bit) then you can let them run around so they dong bug you while you're enjoying the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Palomared

Only thing what is boring to me, it's a lot of pop art and I am not very in love with pop art, especially because you can meet pop art pieces in every gallery or museum in USA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/H5650ODninas
50,Awesome must see!,"We visited The Broad museum for the first time during our stay in LA and it is a must see! Although tickets to the museum are free of charge, I would highly recommend reserving tickets online, for a nominated booking time, at least 1 day before as the lines for entrance can be quite long. Once inside it's best to go straight to the iPad to book for the infinity room, which is a mirrored room full of lights turning on and off and definitely a highlight of the museum! You will be given an estimated waiting and then sent a text message when your turn is soon. The collections are quite interesting, albeit a bit bizarre! The upper level was housing some great pieces like Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons installations. The interior layout of the museum is also really interesting to take it. Staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions. Overall it is a truly amazing piece of architecture and I would highly recommend visiting the museum!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clpgreen
50,Nice Museum,"It's a must visit place in LA! Once you're there, you have the chance to admire pieces of artists like Roy Lichenstein, Jeff Khoons and Andy Warhol. The building itself is beautiful and very pleasant to walk through.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MariliaL_12
50,Reserve your free tickets online first!,"The Broad is a free to enter Modern Art museum. I highly recommend booking your tickets online in advance. You book an entry time slot on a nominated day. If you want to see the ever popular Infinity Mirrored room on the ground floor you should book the first available (11am in the week and 10am at the weekend) slot. We were amongst the first to be let in (11.00am tickets on a Tuesday) and were taken straight to a line for the Infinity Room. We didnt even need to book on the iPad as we were among the first 40 or people in there. If you arrive later you have to enter your cell number on the iPad and even if it estimates a 3 hour wait it can be less so be prepared for an earlier recall!It is worth the wait! You only get 45 seconds in there, either solo or with your accomplices. I recommend getting your phone ready in camera mode and in the 45 seconds try to take it all in for the first 10 seconds, then take some portrait photos for the next 10 seconds, some landscape photos in the next 10 seconds, and a 10 second revolving video if you can to capture it fully!There are three floors of Modern Art here, most of it fascinating, paintings, sculptures and other 3D and animated pieces. There is a lift inside The Broad and this is a piece of art in itself, you ascend and descend in a round glass tube!There are also temporary seasonal installations here, the current one is 'Creature' which is very interesting.A great tip for parking for The Broad is to park at the California Plaza, nearest address is 348 S Olive St. between W 3rd and 4th St. They will validate your ticket at the Broad in the Gift Shop. It took the cost of our parking ticket down from $39 to $8!Other things to see while here - the Walt Disney Concert Hall next door to The Broad, the OUE Skyspace slide in the US Bank Tower is only 3 blocks away, and also in the US Bank Tower Bar 71 which gives you 360 degree views high over Los Angeles. It is now the highest bar in the city!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sge31
40,If you go now you will be able to see the Creature collection,"I was so impressed with the building when I first saw it I was so pleased that we had booked our tickets.When we entered there are 2 levels of exhibitions.Down stairs was the Creature exhibition which had a notice that parents might not want younger children to see the graphic and sexual exhibits.I was not personally keen on this level.On the upper floor there is a large gallery with a huge variety of painting,sculptures and other art forms.Famous artists such as Warhol were represented.There was something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/oldnorman
40,Pretty cool installations!,"It was my first time visiting the Broad museum. The line was insane and we got there 2 minutes before opening. We waited over an hour to get in. I suggest reserving tickets online for a certain date and time to avoid the lines. Tickets are free!The one drawback we had was that the closed off the entire first floor except for one installations, because they were working on new installations. We were able to however see Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room installation - a must see. While you only have about 45 seconds to see it, it is pretty cool. You are standing on a small platform on water with mirrors and lights all around. Note that the lights do dim on and off in those 45 seconds, so take pictures quickly! Because each guest or group gets only 45 seconds in there, the wait is about 3-5 hours long.The other exhibits were interesting. I loved the Alice in wonderland sized table and chair set. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well.I am only giving it 4 stars because almost the entire first floor was closed to work on installations, otherwise I would be giving it 5.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/east0ne
50,Contemporary Art on a Colossal Scale,"The Broad is all about scale. Large, spacious rooms host massive works, some of which wrap around several walls. Painting and sculpture from the 1980s to the present make up the heart of this rich collection, and American artists predominate. I was particularly impressed with the Broad's Ellsworth Kelly collection and stunning Jeff Koons sculptures in their electric-bright colors. The Broad collection appears to be less comprehensive than the Fisher collection that dominates the newly expanded San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, but California is all the richer now that both of these collections are so beautifully housed and displayed.Although there is no entrance fee to attend the Broad, do go online and make a timed reservation well in advance of your visit. Lines to enter for those who do not have reservations are very, very long.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/279kenh
50,Great modern art museum,"Great addition to Los Angeles, had the opportunity to visit last month, truly amazing art work. Highly recommended ! 👍🏼",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TheWorldTraveler2025
40,Easy to Like Modern Art,"Make sure you have reserved your tickets online prior to showing up at the museum! It is not worth waiting in the hot sun. My husband and I were lucky to only wait 20 minutes; the usual wait is 45 minutes or more. The escalator to the third floor is futuristic, kind of like Space Mountain at Disneyland. The cylindrical glass elevator slides open like a scene from Star Trek. Looking out from the inside of the building provides some interesting framing for your photos. So, that's a long way of saying that the architecture from the inside is much more compelling than the outside of the building indicates. Many of the artworks have been displayed previously at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the Broad Building. They are fairly accessible, with lots of bright colors and textures. Curation is poor, but that's pretty standard for Los Angeles area museums. Plan to spend 1.5 hours in the permanent collection of the third floor. Allow another hour if there's a special exhibit on the first floor. No artworks on the second floor, just administrative offices. The gift shop is very small, but has some unusual items that I've seen nowhere else, including some cool Keith Haring designed games and notecards. I recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RabbiWendy
50,Fantastic Collection of Contemporary Art,"Spending an afternoon at the Broad is worth it just for the visitor experience alone. Yes, it's tough to book a reservation. I highly recommend doing so on-line a month prior to your visit. Believe me. Even if you're not a fan of contemporary art, this museum is worth it!What amazed me most are the knowledgeable gallery guards. They all have a Masters Degree in art and many of the guards give spot tours of a section of the museum for which they are responsible.Even if you hate the art, going to the Broad is a WOW experience!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/724JimB724
50,Incredible collection,"A small but perfectly formed collection of incredible art. Make sure you reserve your free tickets online before going, the queues outside on the midweek day that I went were long on a hot day. I expect weekends would be worse. It took me less than a couple of hours to see everything. I put my name down for the infinity room when I got there and went in about 2 hours later. You can leave and return though which is good. It's definitely worth going to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/welshanna1
50,Enjoyable look at contemporary art,"Small but enjoyable museum featuring some great pieces of art. Easy to get tickets (free) and well organized. Only problem: underground parking entrance poorly marked. We drove by it twice before asking someone where it was. Only sign was inside on the parking ticket dispenser. Otherwise, beautiful building and fun experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cgm95
50,Great New Addition to LA,"The Broad is definitely worth adding to your list when planning a visit to downtown LA!As others have mentioned, admission is free however I strongly suggest going on line to get advanced tickets. The Broad has timed entry and there is a walk up line but depending on the flow, you could be in for a wait. I made my reservations a few weeks before. The one mistake I made was not reviewing the website thoroughly enough. The current exhibit - Infinity Mirrored Room required another reservation when you entered the museum. By our 1:00pm entry, they had no more availability. I should have planned to go earlier. The reviews are awesome to see this room.We opted to park at the building itself. There was plenty of room and helpful attendants. Caution to those who are concerned with their cars - the majority of the spaces are tandem Parking so you have to give up your keys. With validation it was only $12.We queued up in the designated 1:00 line. There were museum staff who checked your ticket (digitally or paper) and validated your parking. They also provided a map and tour brochure. Also you can download the Broad app for self guided tours and other information. They ran on time so if you arrive 10 minutes before your designated time, you won't have to wait too long.There are some great works and exhibits to see and appreciate, but I think the best part for me was talking to the docents. They were so knowledgeable and provided great insight, info on the artists and were patient and helpful. Apparently they are all art students.We were able to go through the whole museum in less than two hours. Before you grab your car, be sure to walk further down Grand to the Disney Concert Hall and walk their gardens or stroll through Grand park! It was well worth the time!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Syllyt01
50,Very impressive structure,"We went there without online reservation, waited in line approx 45 minutes. Entry is free, large backpack was asked to store in a free storage area at the entry, not a big museum, mostly modern art works, a good place to hang out for a day with families.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jinqiulu
50,Great private modern art collection,"After seeing (a few years ago) excerpts from the Broad collection at LACMA, I mistakenly thought the family favored poseurs like Jeff Koons. Now that they have a big building of their own, they can show the broad range of their collecting, which includes Joseph Beuys, Cy Twombley, John Baldessari, George Condo, the Bechers, and Neo Rauch. (Alas, there was no Rauch hung the day I visited.) It's a wide-ranging and important survey of international modern art. It does lean American.I visited on a weekday, because I did not have an advance, timed ticket. They book up months in advance. I got in the no-ticket line at 10:15, behind about 20 people. (You need sun protection!) At 11AM, they started to admit the people with real tickets, which revealed how many no-shows there might be. I got in by about 11:30. It's free. I was allowed to re-enter after a pricey lunch at the associated but not connected fine-dining restaurant. There's a snack bar on site.I came on the light rail line from Pasadena, and transferred to the Metro to the Civic Center stop. It was another 5 minute walk from there. I went to the MOCA art museum across the street, and then walked around downtown. There are more pedestrians in L.A. than I expected. There are (pay) parking garages all around the Broad. Forget about street parking.A word about viewing: I saw one young visitor after another taking a selfie at a big pile of oversize dinner plates. That's an untitled 1993 sculpture by Robert Therrien. Not one visitor walked AROUND the sculpture, which produces a dizzying feeling of movement because of the way the plates are each at a different angle. This is an art museum. LOOK at the art while you're here!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/obsoperator
50,Amazing,Some of the best art I've seen anywhere. And it's free. I paid some money so I could see the rotating exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9236AQstevec
50,Best art museum,What a wonderful addition to LA. The art collection is exceptional - provided you are a fan of contemporary art. Even the stand in line is fun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VAINLA
50,wonderful art gallery,"wonderful art gallery – is a contemporary art museum lots of Andy Warhol, Liechtenstein, Jean‐Michel Basquiat, Jeff Koon",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/squashed_boxer
50,An amazing museum!,"The Broad is an amazing building with a wonderful collection of contempory art. Well worth a visit!If you make a reservation, you have an advantage entering over the visitors that just drop in.Parking is underneath the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Albertm
50,Engaging Art Due to Great Curation,"Curating and arranging an art exhibit is an art unto itself. The Broad’s Creature exhibit shows how well they can pull together what seems like a disparate collection of art and unify it through a theme. I enjoyed the variety in this temporary exhibit.The third floor gallery has lots of fun art, such as Blue Balloon Dog from Jeff Koons, as well as many thought-provoking pieces, such as those from Glenn Ligon. The skylights make this gallery the best I’ve seen for viewing art.The exhibit that drew me to the Broad was Yayoi Kasama’s Infinity Mirrored Room. It is a small, mirrored room with water surrounding the viewing platform. LED lights hang from the ceiling. The effect is stunning, as if you are looking out into infinity.The Broad is very popular. You need to plan ahead. I secured tickets online for The Broad on the first day of the month of my visit. Then, once inside the museum, I queued to get a same-day entrance time for the mirrored room. I was assigned a time that was 3 hours in the future, but received a text about 2 hours later. I think that’s because although they plan for one person at a time in the mirrored room, they actually allow two. There are many people who don’t want to stand in the room alone. However, I recommend going into the room alone. It’s spectacular! You get only one minute.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DigitalRabbit
50,A Must See,"Although I am not particularly attracted to the original Broad Collection, there is enough of interest in this new museum to make it worth an afternoon's visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/markmd
50,Gorgeous.,"Amazing building that houses a fantastic collection of contemporary art. Displayed beautifully and not overwhelming in scale. Only draw back was we couldn't get into see one of the art exhibits as we had to have reserved tickets before hand. There was an option to stand by but the lineup was 2 hours longs. If you are planning ahead check to see if you can get advanced tickets. Oh, free admission was a pleasant bonus.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amberb00
50,My favourite free museum in LA!,"I've been to The Broad twice now and love the convenient location in Downtown LA, being so central and close to restaurants and shops. I've reserved my tickets online a month or so in advance, and adore their selection of art. Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, John Baldessari and more. Great way to kill time in LA, and escape the heat for awhile!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Anneliese44
50,A wonderful art experience,"It takes a little preparation to visit the Broad but it is SO worth it. First we got reservations online for 11:00 am on a weekday so we didn't have to stand in line. We also decided to spring for the $12 three hour parking in the building to save our energy for seeing the art rather than walking from a cheaper parking space. (Admission to the museum is free so the parking fee was'nt so bad) 't immediately signed up to see the Kusama Infinity Room and only needed to wait 1/2 hour before we got in. The exhibit we saw was called Creature which was a curated show of many of the contemporary artists the Broad features. Then we went up to the permanent collection which we had seen before but it is always nice to see again and again, and they do change things up from time to time. The gallery attendants (not guards) are all artists and are knowledgeable about the art on view. A nice young woman explained the technique of some of the art pieces which was very informative. There are some restaurants nearby but we brought a lunch with us and we were able to sit in a shaded spot next to the museum and enjoy our lunch. All in all a lovely visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/janny45
40,Artsy experience,"Visited The Broad for The Infinity Room, didn't managed to book in advance so we queued for the walk in opportunity. Waited about an hour plus to get our number and another hour for admission time. Totally worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mclarenna
50,Nice!,"The Broad is cool. Check their website to see what installations they currently have. Great photo ops ie. The light room, the giant table, Michael Jackson statue. I bought tickets online way in advance, I don't know if tickets have become easier to get. I DID NOT get into the light room because the line was super long and they told me even if I stepped in line now, I wouldn't get in before the place closed. They have some interesting work here, it definitely is a fun place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lindsayzdz
50,Museum - Brings in amazing light,Another fascinating piece of architecture - beside Disney Hall in the heart of downtown LA. Very interesting museum - inside and outside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mari0nP
50,The Best Museum of Contemporary Art I have Ever Visited,"The facility is, in itself, a treat. Massive rooms, high ceilings and exhibits that take your breath away.The quality of the exhibits and the staff is top rate. We walked from the Melenium Biltmore. I hope to be back to see the same or another exhibit next year.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Pages-Daddy
40,Small but impressive collection,"The Broad is in a very beautiful building, just across the street from the Gehry designed Disney Concert Hall. We went early in the morning on a weekend and waited in line for our assigned time of entrance. You should get the tickets ahead of time, or there is a long wait. The collection is all contemporary art with many well known artists represented. It is not a very large exhibition space and it can be seen in an hour or so. Probably it is worth a one time visit for people interested in contemporary art and architecture. The artwork is very colorful, and seemed that youngsters enjoyed the experience also. Parking on weekends is very convenient, but $12 flat fee. Like anything in Downtown LA, get there early.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/615edwards
50,New Stunning Museum,"Not to be missed if you are into contemporary art! The building itself is an art piece. Designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R) in collaboration with Gensler is aptly dubbed ""the veil and the vault"". You will be richly rewarded by the Board collection. The plaza next to the Broad features a grove of 100+ year old Barouni olive trees. Just wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nancyqc
40,Great building solid collection.,"Easy to book complimentary tickets online (book on the 1st of the preceding month of visit). Great space and the building adds to the experience without over shadowing. The usual collection of modern artists with a few lesser exhibited artists, it seems that a Jeff Koons (or 3 or 4) are standard issue to any modern museum. The museum did loose power while touring and the staff was commendable for dealing with this unforeseen event. Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room was a special treat. Interesting to compare this one collector collection (Broad) with its similar (Fisher) neighbor up North; SFMOMA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tryingfor100
30,the building is outstanding,"the art seems more chosen to make a superficial splashy impression than to display any depth of feeling or awareness.worth visiting, but the building is much more interesting than what is in it",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlotte_34
50,You must see this place!!!1,"So besides the fact that some of the most amazing pieces of modern art are hosted here but the architecture is a must see. It was truly impressive to see in person and the experience they curate was priceless. And to top it all off, its free...so it truly is priceless.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JBrooks2334
50,Fantastic new museum,"Awesome and impressive collection of art and a great addition the art scene in LA. I saw the Cindy Sherman exhibit this summer, and I was blown away. The collection on display was quirky and eclectic. I could have stayed for an entire day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/acdhuber
50,trending!,"by all accounts one of the coolest museums in the county. aside from being fairly new, they managed to get the most interesting exhibits to date. lines are really long and one particular exhibit- the infinity room is quite a challenge to visit unless you have the entire day to wait for your turn. entrance is free if you don't mind the waiting but for 12bux to see a special paid exhibit, you can enter the museum faster. paid parking is available in a lot across the street and the walt disney hall is just right beside the broad. there are also a few places to eat at outside and there was even a food truck right outside the main entry catering to the people in line when we were there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mTan66
10,Rude and abrasive employees,Took the wife here and we never encountered ruder or more abrasive employees in our lives! This was upsetting to the wife because she's a big art lover but the employees' attitude completely broke her heart. When I informed management about this we got more of the same. Not the best way to treat out-of-town guests!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Snowcats95

50,Wonderful Peak Into Contemporary Art,"While I would not call the Broad the most extensive contemporary art collections it is one of the best curated and finest I have seen, given that its from a private collection. I would venture to guess that it has the most Joseph Beuys and John Baldessari under one roof. You can easily navigate the third floor collection in about 1.5 hours time at most. The building itself is gorgeous with a lattice work skin allowing light to filter into the museum. We arrived on late weekday afternoon without tickets and waited no more than 10 minutes to get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BellBoys60625
50,High quality contemporary art,Beautifully high quality contemporary art in an excellent display setting. The explanations of the art are well written. An app of the Broad and its artwork is available. The Broad is a worthwhile experience. Get the tickets on line for free or the wait can be 1-2 hours to get in. The Broad has umbrella's available to shield you from the sun while you wait.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelmaven1
50,Great place to visit,"Our daughter has studied Art and wanted to go to a gallery/exhibition. Our hosts in the US suggested The Broad. Not really me and the hubby's cup of tea but we were really impressed. We had to wait in line for almost an hour to get in (apparently it's usually like this). It was worth the wait though. What a great exhibition, a wide variety of things to see. Ignore my ignorance as I cannot name the artists other than Andy Warhol. All I can really say is if you have time visit, it's worth it. Also like to say what lovely staff. A last plus is that it was free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orlando2010
50,SmartArt,"Excellent collection, fantastic building, wonderful curation, a true feast for the eyes and the soul. Inform yourself beforehand, and you'll enjoy it more.

50,The Broad: An Exceptional Experience,"Since Cindy Sherman is one of my favorite photographers, I made it a point to visit the Broad last month to see her exhibit. It was blazing hot that day and a very kind museum employee gave me a bottled water...no charge!The CS photos on display were just magnificent and amazing. It's hard to say which of her photos made the biggest impression on me, but it may have been the ""aging movie divas"" series.I recently met Genevieve Gaignard, a young L.A.-based self-portrait photographer, whose own work is currently on display at the California African-American Museum. When I told Genevieve that her work reminded me of CS's I think she was a little taken aback, but I meant it as a huge compliment.The CS collection I saw at the Broad encompassed work she has done over several decades and it helps you to understand how she's regarded as one of the most influential photographers around today. You can't get around it if you focus on quirky themes, costumes and self-portrait photography....you are going to be compared to Cindy Sherman because she really is the leading pioneer of that genre.Anyway, I said all that to say I really enjoyed my The Broad experience and will definitely visit it again!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/492HappyTraveler
50,Amazing,We didnt reserve tickets and qeued for only half an hour and were even offered umbrellas for the sun. The building itself is worth the whole visit and so is the works exhibited - the combination is great. Thanks!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mste0014
50,a great collection,"Having see the BCAM at LACMA, i expected this to be mostly a replay. It was not.

50,Highly enjoyable private tour of impressive contemporary art collection,"A highly knowledgeable and friendly private guide arranged for us by this year-old museum - - an impressive collection of contemporary art in an appealingly designed and naturally-lighted building - made my wife's and my recent visit special. We generally prefer to view Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, but this talented guide helped us understand better what contemporary artists - and the Broads as collectors - are trying to accomplish and even to applaud a number of works. Well worth a visit for any art-lover.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ChevyCh64
40,"new museum, a new outlook","The museum is our newest, maybe not the most exciting. The museum feels like a poor (New) Whitney. You see outside but hardly so a little confining.

50,Compact museum but filled with amazing pieces!,"The architecture itself is worth visiting, one of a kind design that juxtaposes interestingly next to the Disney Hall. It houses all contemporary art works from paintings and sculptures of many famous artists all around the world. I think it's a great place to not be overwhelmed for those are aren't necessarily art-lovers but want to get an all around visual arts exposure. Highly recommend it but would advise booking in advance online to skip the long lines of waiting.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/l0uisef0ng

40,Get there early to see the Kusama.,"The objective of rationing tickets by time rather than money is a laudable one but, a year after opening, it all felt a little haphazard at times. Arriving at 1030 to line up for the daily free admits worked (umbrellas were handed out as parasols) and we entered at 1100 and quickly secured our place for a later viewing of Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. This was the must-see exhibit. Felt like the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris but more accessible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeremyS588

For those of you who like architecture, the building is just a piece of art! Loved it!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Quichi2013
50,Excellent small collection,"This museum is not large, but choice in its collection of modern art. The complimentary in-house guide gave a great talk of some highlights in the collection.To know: Free admission except for some special shows ($12 for the Cindy Sherman exhibit when I visited.) Book your timed ticket in the month before you intend to visit - ticket go on sale the first of that month. Still, there stand-by options which I did. The line goes quickly.There is a nice gift shop on site, and a few nearby restaurants for a bit (nothing on site.)Suggestion for the shop: nicely chosen items, but hiding the price tags on the jewelry in the case is really annoying. For that reason alone I wouldn't buy anything in the case if they can't repeect their customers. (I did buy a couple of books.)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mme_X
50,Art is trendy but fun,"Loved the Cindy Sherman exhibit. The setting is great, reservations help but if you go at off times and are willing to wait you ca n get in.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shesh46
40,Art at the Broad,"Fun museum, nice art, mostly pop art. LONG LINES. Still haven't seen the infinity room, after two visits. Get there early. Like 8am to line up.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LittleBirdy667
50,everything is there,"you can find different pieces of Art, even unrelated, so you will definitely not get bored, because there is always something in exhibit for different taste",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mkb975
50,Excellent collection and not overwhelming,"The Broad is small enough that you won't feel overwhelmed as you might with some of the larger museums. You could even combine a trip to The Broad with a visit to the La Brea Tar Pits to ensure that you get some indoor viewing and some outdoor viewing. Their collection is extensive and they rotate what's on display, so you can visit repeatedly and see new stuff, just like the larger museums. They also bring in excellent special exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanKnee
50,Loved it!,My husband and I aren't huge fans of modern art but this museum is different; most of the pieces had an interesting story and they were mostly fun to look at. We had reserved tickets in advance and were glad we did as the wait can be very long if you're just hoping for first come first serve tickets.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Najebo
50,Art of today art its best,"The Broad is LA's newest museum and it delivers a world class art experience. Here's a chance to see what a single, passionate art collector assembled over decades of searching for the most dramatic, important contemporary art being made around the world.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cliffe665
40,A Great Collection!,"It's proximity to MOCA and the Walt Disney Concert Hall makes it a great choice to plan a day to downtown LA around.With all the hype surrounding the opening of this new museum, we had to reserve tickets many months in advance. The museum itself was great-- the collection was varied and laid out in a way that was easy to walk through and follow. And although we went through the museum in about an hour, it's a great place to be and just walk around, especially on a hot LA day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NK1W
50,New Downtown Showcase for Modern Art,"Downtown L.A. has a new art showcase to complement MOCA, across the street on Grand Ave. The building is beautiful but totally interior without any vistas of downtown. The standing collection is fresh and colorful and the recent traveling installation of ""Cindy Sherman: Imitation of Life"" was captivating. I look forward to future exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/3Dphotographer
40,"Pretty good, pretty, pretty good","Not to be sniffed at; contemporary art of the highest quality for free in an incredible setting. That said, some of the pieces are bad and faddish and overall the show is badly curated considering the wealth of incredible pieces on display. Could be sublime with some tweaking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/malcolm79
50,"Went for the giant balloon dog, stayed for the infinitely mirrored room","We stumbled upon this place, took a chance to wait in the outside line to get in, and were glad we did. It made our day.Not everything will be to everyone's liking, but it's mostly very accessible contemporary art and contains some great pieces/installations. Well worth seeing, especially with the free admission!The line outside moved quickly, but if you plan to attend, try to get a timed-entry ticket online so you don't have to wait.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Finny442
50,LA's Newest Museum,"I like to visit museums all over the world, especially in New York City and I was totally wowed by the Broad. It has modern art that enriches visits to any other museum. Well worth the difficulty in getting tickets. I can't wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pwplatt
50,WOW!,Completely enjoyed the special exhibit and the regular exhibits. We went to MOCA first and I have to say the Broad was much more enjoyable. The architecture is equally as interesting and enjoyable as the art. Great gift shop too. Try to go to Otium for food or drink before or after the museum - fantastic!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KBWCO
50,Half and half,"Half the collection is brilliant, half is pure garbage. Find and enjoy the great art. Don't miss the infinity room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jeffs232
50,MUST SEE ART AND BUILDING,"Some of the greatest 20th-century art around, is displayed here. Everyone you've ever heard of is represented. The building itself is another work of art. Get the free app in advance, and it will tell you more about both the art and the building. Very organized, but you better reserve your tickets in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffreyGL48
50,Best Modern Museum in the world!,"The Broad is one of the best collection of modern work in the world. The fun unique collection that they house is amazing. We are allowed to take pictures without any restrictions from a typical art museum. If you are in Los Angeles and you enjoy art, you need to make at stop at The Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fishking88
50,Great Addition to DT Los Angeles,"Loved the art; enjoyed the experience. Architecturally beautiful inside and out. Staff were polite and very helpful. They all smile and stand, unlike the Paris museum staff who seem to never smile. Do make a reservation to see special exhibitions ($12) as you then have a time slot to enter and avoid waiting in long lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Great2TravelCA
50,A most amazing visit to a most amazing museum,"The museum is across the street from the LA MOCA and across another street from the Disney. The philanthropy of the Broad family, buying the land, demolishing the previous buildings, contracting with the architect and construction company to build a museum, and then filling it with their own collected art is what is amazing! Admission is free but tickets are only available long in advance online. A suggestion is to buy tickets for the special exhibition, which allows admission to the entire museum afterwards.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thefriedlands
50,Thorough Representation of post WWII Paintings and Sculpture,"Our visit to the Broad was most interesting and educational. The scope of the collection is massive and many artists are represented by multiple works. There are beautiful paintings, strange ones, and a nice variety of sculpture. Most of the artwork is very accessible even for children. The galleries did not seem over crowded, the gift shop is amazing (also expensive) and the building is a revelation. A must see stop for modern art lovers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielml85
20,"Great Building with Insignificant ""Art""","Went here using lightrail line from Arcadia and super way to go downtown as $8 RT for two. Had to buy $12 each ticket to Cindy Sherman exhibition to get a reserved time. Other parts free but need a time reservation otherwise 2 or 3 hour wait and NOT worth it. It is ""modern art"" which my wife have seen a lot of throughout the worlde but this collection is at best mediocre minus. Cindy Sherman does not believe in titles which is good as nothing to remember other than redundancy and self-absorption.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N8029ZYjohnb
40,"Incredible building, amazing Cindy Sherman exhibition","The Broad, in downtown LA, is a magnificent building. From the outwork the lattice network is really stunning, and inside is loads of smooth, curved concrete. The look of the building makes it enjoyable just to walk around. I went there specifically to see the Cindy Sherman exhibition ""Imitation of Life"", and it seriously blew my mind. I've been a fan of her work ever since I first saw one of her film stills, but this exhibition was so thorough, so thought provoking and so extensive that it really made me appreciate her photography a lot more. After that I walked through the rest of the Broad collection upstairs. To be honest, I didn't really like it, but that's just to my personal taste - I'd still recommend going if you're into modern art. It was also really cool to be able to see into the cold storage vaults (as you walked down the stairs there were large window in the walls allowing you to see the stored artwork). I would return if nothing else for the building itself, it was really magnificent.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/466amys
50,Wonderful experience!,We decided to make a last minute visit to The Broad museum. Their collection is amazing and we had so much fun! The entrance tonthe third floor was free and they lent us umbrellas for sun protection while we were waiting at the cue outside :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/therezaj
50,Incredible collection and it's FREE!!,We reserved our FREE tickets a month ago and the Broad did not disappoint! This is an incredible collection and an absolutely beautiful building- inside and out! We loved the Infinity Room- we entered our name digitally and they texted us when our time came! Take a ride in the glass elevator! This museum is a MUST-SEE!! Thank you for the incredible opportunity to see these great works for FREE!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/T606EJlaurac
50,"Fun, modern, experiential: LA must visit landmark","Great museum experience: contemporary architecture, modern art, many knowledgeable staff members on the floor who are ready to attend any queries. We were able to catch a special exhibition: the infinity room - was incredible: they let 1-2 ppl in at the time in the dark room filled with small lights reflecting in the mirror walls creating a feeling that the room is endless.Pros: expect a line. Though as soon as you get in it is not overcrowded.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MikeAlen
50,Fun and imagitive art,So get ready to open your mind to creative art! By the time you leave hopefully you have gained appreciation of some fun visual art that makes you rethink what art is. Kids will have a lot of fun too as it really does play with the creative.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/K3815RIscottc
40,Special Exhibit was Great!,Cindy Sherman exhibit and Infinity Room was great! Definitely need to get advance reservation. Very close to Disney concert hall the rest of downtown LA tour sites.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mayl776
30,"Modern Art, but the wait for the light exhibit was long","Went here on a random wednesday afternoon that my sister and i got tickets to. As soon as we got in, put our name on the wait list for the light exhibit. The wait was over 3 hours long. Unfortunately you cannot occupy yourself inside the museum for that long as there's only one floor of art work other than the light exhibit. Needless to say, we spent 30 minutes at the museum and went home. Parking was $12",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rx-art
40,Small museum so you can get through it in an hour.,"Small museum so you can get through it in an hour. If you want to go to the main attraction (infinity mirrored room), stand in line for it first!! Go to the iPad! Don't make the mistake that I did. I'm still crying inside about it. I thought I could work my way down from the 3rd floor and by the time I got down, the attraction was CLOSED!! :( This was at 1pm and my time to get in to the museum was 12pm. I heard the attraction closed at 12:30pm. Waah!!!Also, book your tickets online and ahead of time so that you can get in for sure. They won't let you in earlier than your scheduled time (fyi). Also, you don't want to be waiting outside to see if you might get in. I don't know how long the wait would be.Tip: If you take the escalator up, it takes you to the 3rd floor, not 2nd. Restrooms are on the 2nd floor.Parking: We parked at the California Plaza (351 S Olive St.). It might look closed because the gate is down but it will magically open once you grab a ticket. Validation is $8 (3hr parking). Just ask an employee in the gift shop for a validation card. I think it's better to park on this side (across the street from The Broad) because Mendocino Farms and Lemonade are on the parking lot side. Subway is on the side of the museum. blah.1 star down because the main attraction was closed early. boo!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caliiitrav
50,Modern Art at its finest,"Newly opened and designed by Diller Scofidio and Renfro, this modern museum is the hottest ticket in the Los Angeles Art scene. It houses the collection of Eli and Edythe Broad, who also helped bring the Walt Disney Concert Hall to Los Angeles. It has over 2,000 works of art including Lichenstein, Warhol, and Ruscha to name a few. It's free to the public and it's best to get a appointment ticket online. The infamous ""Infinity Room"" has a 5 hour wait for your 40 seconds of fame inside of it! But rumor has it that 5 more infinity rooms will be added in the near future! Definitely a must see in DTLA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theJasonTadeoShow
50,For lovers of modern and great architcture,"The Broad collection is free but be sure to make your reservations at least one month in advance! Or, to not stand in the long line, purchase a ticket for the special exhibition and stand in a much shorter line...your will see it all. Great museum store and the structure itself makes up for any wait you may have/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaBernardi
50,I'm not a big fan of art but...,the Cindy Sherman exhibit is a must see if your in downtown and the museum is a really cool building and I loved it and Im even started to like Art !,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidkR1246LM
50,Enjoyed!!,"I enjoyed this museum! The architecture, natural lighting and open design were easy on the eyes. It took about an hour and 15 minutes to enjoy the 3rd floor collection. The museum ""guards"" are all educated about the history of the museum and the artwork. The best thing we did was talk to them! They are enthusiastic and friendly, anxious to share their knowledge--but not if you don't ask! The paintings and sculptures are all post-war modern and very colorful, overall. I also enjoyed the two million dollar elevator in the center, which is round glass surrounded by a brushed chrome tube.Be sure to reserve your entry ticket the museum website in advance. Also, don't forget to get your parking validation, which is worth $10.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edyrp
50,Highlight of our LA trip!,This was one of the most impressive private collections of contemporary art! We attended the special exhibition plus the permanent collection. The building architecture was interesting as well.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DesertDiva31
50,A great day downtown!,We went for the Cindy Sherman exhibit which was wonderful but had just as much fun looking at the art in the main galleries. It was a thought provoking collection and three generations of family really enjoyed the work and discussing it afterward at lunch. The only thing that was tough was the system to get in - we had reservations and were initially sent to the wrong line by the girl working the door. But how fabulous to have lines around the block for a museum in Los Angeles!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thesuz1218
50,Great space for art,"The building is endlessly fascinating to look at and photograph. So many wonderful architectural details. They rotate the art from their collection (you can peek at the vault!) and I enjoyed what I saw when I was there: Thomas Struth, Anselm Kiefer, Cy Twombly and Basquiat, among others. Looking forward to seeing another part of the collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joyfulsteps
50,Beautiful building and exposition,It is absolutely worth it visiting the broad. General admission is free all the time. The exposition is wonderfull! And the building is fantastic too!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JordanFrey
30,Free exhibit is modern art,"If you're looking for the classics this is not the place to see it. While the architecture is interesting, the layout and the collection was too modern for my taste. I didn't see the paid exhibits but if that's your sort of thing, by all means :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/polek2014
40,An Amazing Modern Collection,"I finally made it to the Broad to see the Cindy Sherman exhibit. It was one of the best ""monograph"" exhibits I've ever seen. You could really see the evolution of Sherman's work over time, and the progress from little 4x6"" works to larger-than-life-sized prints was masterfully arranged.Afterwards, I went upstairs to see the permanent collection, and really enjoyed the variety and depth of the works shown. In many ways, I found it more compelling than LA MOMA down the street. I'm not a huge fan of some of the more whimsical and theoretical modern art. For example, Jeff Koons' big balloon dog and silver bunny are cute, but raise that eternal question: Are they art? Well, the Broad went a long way to convincing me that they are. Seen in context, I had a better feel for modern art than I have in the past, and the overall humor of it all had me laughing to myself many times.It was nice to see so many people from all ages and backgrounds really engaging with the art, laughing, smiling, taking selfies... It really feels like this is ""the people's museum.""The building is beautiful on the inside, whatever you may think of its somewhat controversial exterior. It imbues art with fun.My only ding on the overall rating is the horrible system they have for admitting people to the ""Infinite Mirrors"" exhibit. Boo. If you arrive at the museum much past opening, you have little to no chance of seeing this installation. I would think it would be fairer to make it a random lottery, perhaps even when you bought your ticket, to offer a few people every hour a chance to see it. When I asked a docent at 12:30 if there was a chance to see it, he just laughed gently and said no.Other than that, the Broad is fantastic!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidOfLA
40,Interesting collection,"The collection at the Broad should be seen at least once. It varies from the pop art of Warhol and other well known artists to the Infinity Room (experiential) to the incoherent wailing of a woman to a collection of Hoover vacuums! You will appreciate some things, be engaged by others and try to understand why some things are considered art. Don't miss the amazing building in which this collection is housed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/055LavoniaD
50,Appreciate the Art for Free,"It may sound very cheap to mention that it is free, but really in this day and age, what great things are free?!Well, the Broad is. The art collection is super impressive. It is all spread out wonderfully and conveniently on the second floor. The space is tremendous, the works are gigantic and you come out a much learned and artistic person. And it's free! So there's no excuse to not visit this grand attraction.My husband and I were in LA for just one day (only to be able to see the Yayoi Kusama exhibit) so we wanted to make it to the museum on time. We tried getting the advanced tickets to the museum but even 28-29 days before the trip, it was sold out! So we reached the museum really early in the morning (at around 9) and luckily we were third in line. By 10, there were at least 50 people in the line. So go early.The Infinity Mirrored Room is magical. You get only 45 seconds but they are totally worth the 2-hour wait in line. Because we were so early in the booking, we got to the room by 1 pm. Otherwise, it would be much later (or not at all!) Don't take flash pics inside, it will ruin the show. Make sure to click yourself too with the room so you can show off later.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PriyamGopani
50,So pleasantly surprised,"I am one of those terrible Angelos who visits museums in other cities but not my own. Shame on me. It took an out of town friend to get me to go to the Broad. Lucked out, walked in, NO WAITING...omg...on a Wed just after lunch. Cindy Sherman exhibition. Wowza, so fantastic! She is just amazing...can't say enough so do go before it moves to other venues. The upstairs permanent collection is housed in gorgeous rooms where it appeared there was no electrical light but only the light from the sky filtered through the ceiling. So beautiful. The art was wild, expressive, and...well, I need an art person to explain to me, but given I didn't stay too long, it was a marvelous experience that I continue to savor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drtike
50,Utterly brilliant - and appealed to my 15&18 yr old daughters more than Getty,"I loved the Getty - see my review. But I loved this art gallery just as much. Completely fantastic experience, great variety of modern art...some of which I got, some I didn't!But I enjoyed/loved all of it!Jeff Koons pieces blew me away. I stood in front of Jean‐Michel Basquiat's work for ages....there was plenty more.You must come here! And its a great way to get a taste of downtown LA, nobody wants to spend long in the city when theres so much else to see and do in LA!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OrgasmicCry
50,I fell in-love with this museum,"I had a hard time getting tickets. My tip is if you want to get tickets for the museum, make sure to go to their website every 1st of the month to be able to get tickets for next month (you need to plan in advance). The museum is a must visit when visiting LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VYGalvez
50,My favorite museum in LA,"If you're looking for fresh, funky, modern, and interesting art, this is the place! Worth the wait for tickets - plan in advance to avoid the lines!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/214ericaf
50,A must,Recently opened. It is a must. Nice permanent exhibition. Centrally located in downtown. We will go back.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733dominiqueh
50,Great Museum Great Exhibits,went to see the cindy sherman exhibit as i had see the museum and loved it before. Its a free museum generally so tix must be reserved in advance. and there is always a wait no matter what. but its worth the wait. great Koons sculptures. Great contemporary art thanks to the Broads long history of serious collecting. The sherman exhibit was fantastic.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sport5travel
50,Wonderful Contemporary Art Collection,We went with tickets to the Cindy Sherman Show. (Tickets are complicated to get online for a designated time). We also loved the permanent collection and the building itself.Don't miss walking down the stairs so you can see how they store what's NOT on exhibit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/warrenjaco
50,amazing collection!,"An impressive collection of contemporary art!! If you like art, you cannot miss it!!! The Harrow have managed to put together one of the most impressive private collections in the USa with breathtaking masterpieces of Wharhol, Koons, Cy Twombly, Basquiat, Jasper Jones, Keith haring, Elsworth Kelli etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/danielh707
50,Wonderful addition to downtown LA,The Broad museum is a new addition to LA showcasing the private collection of the Broad family. The art is an extensive collection of modern pieces. The building is also interesting. Try to get advance tickets on-line or get to the museum early in the morning and wait for tickets. The Disney concert hall is down the street and they offer free tours also. Pick up a nice lunch at various food trucks that are in the area.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/431lisaz
50,building itself is a delight,worth the wait in line for a ticket without reservation. The space is cool and invigorating. I used the metro and walked along Grande Ave form 7th street station- quite a long enjoyable walk.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCKaufmanparent
50,Must experience,A very different museum and so glad I went! I think the building is a wonder and fun to experience. The collection is fun and thought provoking. Glad I went,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/538pamelas
50,In love with The Broad.,"Absolutely fantastic when it comes to contemporary art. Totally recommended!The queue was huge really early in the morning, over 2 hours in the waiting line but I have decided to pay USD12 to have access to the Cindy Sherman's exhibition and it gave me access right away to the whole place :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiok132
50,Don't miss this modern museum gem.,"I really enjoyed this museum from top to bottom. The architecture of the building itself is a show stopper - it is a good place to photograph. The collection they displayed when we were there in August was amazing. They had it set up so you didn't feel crowded at all as you viewed the different pieces. The general admission is free but there maybe some additional special exhibits that cost - or may require reservations, check out their website for details and current exhibits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reedmag
50,Modern Cool,"First of all, if you don't have tickets, (free), get there early. I got there at 10:00AM and was about the 50th person in line. It wasn't an unpleasant wait, but you are in the sun. I got in about 10 minutes after opening (11:00), and immediately got in another line, which went quickly for Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. They text you 10 minutes before it's your turn. It is totally beautiful, if only for the 45 seconds you are allowed to view it. One wants to own one of these rooms and have a lounge chair, like your own private universe.The architecture is outstanding, nicely detailed, great lighting.The collection is alright (I thought) having seen so much of the artists on display before, but there are some fun pieces.The Cindy Sherman retrospective, on now, is very good, worth the $12. admission to see it.This isn't a huge museum, one can do it in about an hour. It didn't feel crowded while I was there.Be sure to take the stairs going down, because there are windows into the vault, which is so brilliantly lit, one's curiosity is amused.It's nice to walk around the nearby buildings, like the Disney Concert Hall, across the street, and the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels nearby.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Afazad
50,Be sure to experience the Broad Museum when in Los Angeles,"We were so fortunate to experience the Broad this July 2016 and see the very large and comprehensive Cindy Sherman exhibit to deeply understand her contribution to Art.It was also a privilege to see the work of Jen-Michel Basquiat, Alexander Calder, Jeff Coons, Andy Warhol and other important contemporary and modern artists.Parking is easy in the basement of the building and the line to get in moved quickly as the museum opened. Experiencing the architecture is a real treat with the exterior covering identified as the veil and the inner structure referred to as the vault because that is where the collections are stored and it is possible for visitors to take a peak.Just down the street is the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the City of Angels Catholic Church, both important to see. MOCA is across the street so it is very easy to spend your whole valuable day in the neighborhood.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CatherineBF
50,Really nice and astonish building (better inside),"Lot of famous artists work of art. Building is huge and beautiful. Free entrance in some certain days (keep watching the website!). Andy Warhol, Keith Hering, Roy Lichetenstein can be seen there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/409jesusa
40,Art Galore!!,This is an extensive collection of art. This is mostly modern and eclectic art. Everyone must visit. The only issue is the restrooms. We had a little trouble finding them.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/notfromla
40,Broaden your artistic horizons at the Broad,"The hard part about getting into the Broad is not the entry fee, since general admission is free. What is hard is getting a reservation for that free entry. During busy periods, plan on booking weeks in advance. Temporary exhibits have separate costs, so check the website before booking. Plan way ahead and be prepared to stand in line regardless. Since le tout LA is on line, you can feel part of a hip metro crowd as you wait your turn. The building itself is part of the experience; designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, it opened to standing room only in 2012. The permanent exhibits are contemporary and cutting edge art. Jean‐Michel Basquiat and John Baldessari are heavily represented, but the collections range from Alexander Calder to Jeff Koons. How you feel about the works of these artists will determine how you feel about the displays, but the building is spectacular. One among many details is that visitors can peep into some storage areas for the collections not on display. An affiliated restaurant, the Otium, allows you to eat your trendy as well as observe it. An added plus is the neighbourhood. Walt Disney Concert Hall is here and MOCA is across the street, so your hip-culture immersion is complete.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ParoleAnima
50,Do Not Miss This!,"Spectacular art museum featuring works by renowned artists. It was an amazing sensory experience, to turn a corner and realize you are standing with the works of Andy Warhol, Lichtenstein, Twombly, Ray, Koons, and more. Spectacular! Pay the extra $12 to see the current special showing of Cindy Sherman's work...worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MljH
50,"Excellent exhibits, much better than the MOCA across the street","If you have to choose between the MOCA and the Broad, choose the later. The Broad has bigger and better exhibits. We stayed at the Omni across the street. We also had dinner around the corner from the Broad at the ""Otium"". Superb.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/STC
50,Fun Visit,Went with family to see the infinity room display. You go in one at a time for about a minute. A parent can go in with a child. It was a fun experience. The rest of the museum is intereting as well but not all exhibits are kid appropriate.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Zeusallover
50,The Broad Mode,"Go to Broad (rhymes with Code) Museum to enjoy, yes-really savor some of the most revered contemporary works created by artists, many who still walk this earth in a setting reminiscent of London's, Tate Modern. The Broad's three level art sanctuary - designed by Diller, Scofidio, & Renfro - greets visitors with incandescent, led, and natural light flooding the upper galleries. First floor - comfy, cozy, cave like delineates the levels and displays compelling temporary exhibits such as Yayoi Kusama's ""Infinity Mirrored Room."" The mid 2nd floor section gives us insider art storage view: through the looking glass via oculus window. It is easy to roam from one area to another, employees are well trained, polite host and hostesses who answer questions about Broad Museum which is thankfully modulated to include and indulge us in L.A.'s most exciting, rise to the top best place to visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorenb801
40,Modern Art Mecca,"If you love modern art, this new museum is worth the trip. Warning--some exhibits graphically display sexually explicit and violent subjects which could be (are meant to be?) quite disturbing.The architecture of The Broad enhances the experience, with natural light diffusing throughout the space.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NLV-E
50,We truly enjoyed the Broad,"What an enjoyable couple of hours in The Broad! Super helpful and friendly service from the personnel (we were a bit late, didn't quite know how to get in etc) who helped us to find our way, helped us to get into the infinity room and assisted us in many ways. Exceptionally good. We loved the Cindy Sherman exhibition but also the permanent exhibition upstairs. Beautiful architecture. Great location close to another favorite Disney concert hall and close the the Grand Central market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/henna_mikkila
50,Great architecture - great collection,A beautiful building downtown that diffuse the right light inside.Great collection of modern art but nothing else is you don't appreciate Koon or Basquiat but the impressionists no need to go their and wait for three hours before being in.....As all the museum in L.A. their is no entrance fee - it is free!!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/pierrec577
50,"Fun Exhibits, Hip and Modern","I went here on a recent trip and I did not have a lot of time to spare. I specifically went to check out the Cindy Sherman exhibition. I was not disappointed. There were lines outside to get into the museum, but they moved quickly even though we did not have advance tickets. The workers were helpful in directing us. I was impressed with the museum and I am looking forward to returing when I have more time to explore. I recommend The Broad for people interested in modern art. The outside facade was also impressive in design. There are standby lines and if you are willing to wait, you can get in for free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/caitlinw776
50,Modern art in beautiful building,"A beautiful building, inside and out, with a good collection of modern art. It has a pleasant atmosphere with most of the work on the third floor. A very manageable exhibit you can get a feel for in only a few hours. We visited in the morning, went for lunch, and came back for another hour in the afternoon. Plenty of eating areas in the neighborhood. The museum also has a dining room but we did not try it.Close by we noticed on street 4-hour parking but we took a covered garage parking for all-dat $20.The infinity mirror room is fantastic. You get to enter for 30 seconds. Register online before you go so you don't have to wait in line. You get a time slot when you register.There is also an app ""The Broad"" that you can download and use during your visit.Very helpful staff.The natural lighting in the morning is a beautiful result of the architecture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MehdiJ484
50,Love it,"I love The Broad. The line without advanced tickets is incredibly long. I had advanced tickets I scored online the month prior. The earlier the time, the increased likelihood of seeing the light room. Parking underground is $12 but if you go over 3hrs it's $22. It's worth visiting for sure. The gift shop is minimal. I collect magnets and they didn't have a single one.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chrstne
50,A guaranteed hit with EVERYONE!,"From the fascinating exterior encasement to the intriguing and often playful art displayed within, the Broad is a destination visit for those enamored of modern art as well as its skeptics. The museum is just comprehensive enough that children can enjoy it without being bored and the layout is so easy to navigate and open that you won't get lost or feel claustrophobic. The museum staff is good about limiting the volume of people entering so the art can be appreciated on one's own time schedule. Reserve a ticket in advance to avoid an entrance delay. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mingfatsai
10,Super long wait times,"It is really crowded and unless you don't have a resereved ticket (which get filled months in advance), you have to wait gor hours. The museum opens at 11am on weekdays!!! We were there before the opening and the wait time was 2.5hrs for general admissions and 1:15hrs for the special exhibition. We went for the exhibition since it was shorter, but it was not worth it at all. And by the time we got in, the infinitiy mirror was fully booked! The parking is also $12 for only 3hrs, which most of it you stay in line. This was by far our worst museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sean_kti
30,"Museum 3, restaurant 5++++++++","I was excited to see the new museum. The 80+ foot long mural by Takashi Murakami was incredible! There are some famous artists' work there, like Warhol and Lichtenstein. There were some other large pieces that were fun. But I don't really understand a lot of modern art, like a canvas painted blue, or a chair cut in half glued to a canvas. The building itself is interesting and the restaurant, Otium, is to die for! I will write a separate review of that, but try it! The infinity mirrored room is worth it if you don't have to wait more than about 20 minutes. The Cindy Sherman exhibit was just weird. I guess I felt it was more narcissism than art. If you love modern art, you'd probably give this a 4 review.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HumboldtWoman
40,Nice collection,Nice collection of modern art. We reserved tickets 1 month prior. Reservations for the Infinity Mirrored Room were closed. The space is neat although not as large as other museums. There is a parking garage and some good restaurant options within walking distance.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Q8730YMsharonm
50,Art museum,Advise to buy tickets in advance before you go. We had to wait in line to buy tickets for 45 minutes.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gartravel15
50,"Thrilling, Challenging, Innovative Contemporary Art","The building is breathtaking as light filters through the curved concrete ceilings. Up the escalator, the art of Takashi Murakami explodes across the walls - incredible - if you like contemporary art or not, you will gasp as the complex multi layered huge panels that capture 'In the Land of the Dead' - it's strangely captivating, oriental, story filled. That is the entry to an emotional, visual, intellectual experience of the best of post war contemporary modern art - even if you're not an art lover, you will love this - from Warhol to the breathtaking Infinity Room with it's myriad of sparkling lights by Yayoi Kusama ... see it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/susanneg550
50,Incredible new contemporary museum!,"It took me 3 months to get tickets to this new museum,but the wait was worth it. There are so many different forms of artwork all in one building. It was fun for my pre-teen as well. Parking is affordable and in a parking garage. There is an exhibit that u will want to see that makes you feel like you shrunk..you cyouwalk under a gigantic dining room table and chairs!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lauraj192015
50,Amazing Art!,"Fantastic new contemporary art museum in downtown Los Angeles. It's filled with names you will recognize even if you aren't an art geek - like Warhol.

50,"Pretty darned incredible place with TONS of modern, contemporary art!","Very cool ""free"" museum . . . but you DO have to stand in line to get tickets unless you booked in advance. I happen to like modern, contemporary art and ALWAYS make a point to see what each city has to offer in this area. I was as blown away by ""The Broad"" as I have been at other great MOCA's around the country.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeanValJeanNAZ
40,Contemporary Art,The large 3rd floor gallery has a wide selection of works of Contemporary Art. The space is beautiful and well lit. The building itself is a work of art. The ground floor has a gallery for temporary exhibits. The elevator is cool but take the stairs down to get a glimpse of the second floor storage area. This museum is free and new so is very popular. Plan your trip well in advance to get timed tickets. Otherwise you will end up waiting in a long line to get in.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hikerbear2
30,I missed the Infinity Mirror Room!!!,"The Broad is a modern art museum located in downtown LA ! One of the most famous display is the Infinity mirror room which is a form of individual experimental art which needs advance booking ! I went on Sunday around noon and lined up for about an hour ! You can make advance booking online to avoid the long line up! Unfortunately , when we get in at 1:00, the infinity mirror room has already booked up for the day ! The staff told me that the best time to go is at 10:00 when they first open ! ☹️☹️ The admission is free except some feature exhibition ! I think this is a very good place to spend the afternoon without going to costly theme parks or if you've already got too much tanned at the beach !!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/joycen117
50,Outstanding!,"The building itself is very impressive, and the interior is very spacious and full of light. There is a great range of modern art pieces within the gallery, so there is plenty to see and enough variety to please everyone. My favourite piece was the huge bouquet sculpture by Jeff Koons, as its so colourful and fun. Plus there is plenty of parking in the area so its easy to access by car.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/C8137UUemmaw
50,Outstanding museum!,"Recently visited The Broad while vacationing with my wife and sons. We've taken them to museums in the past, and they have a knowledge of various artists, including those featured at The Broad. I think if you're going to take young children, try to educate them a bit on what they'll see. The art selection was simply phenomenal, and I highly recommend a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ajbalbo
50,"Well Curated, Contemporary Art Museum","The opening of The Broad is so well received it may be difficult to obtain tickets. This relatively small museum on two levels is packed with thought provoking, mind expanding installations. As you enter going up an escalator through a tunnel, one has the sense of being transported into a parallel universe where collections of artifacts are displayed for the explorer to see. Under the Table installation is memorable. The highlight for me was a painting depicting the burning of art by the Nazi's. A part of the downtown revitalization, it has memorable impact and provides another reason to experience the rise in LA's art and fashion culture.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Art-Fashion-Travel
40,"It's free, and not too big so quite manageable","While visiting I kept seeing the line at the Broad snaking down the block and around the corner, so one morning when I had planned to do the free audio guide tour at Disney Hall and when I saw that there were only three people in line I went for it. That was the beginning of an 1 1/2 wait in the sun in July. That's not terrible in itself because it is after all free, and a new venue, with a very popular installation (Infinite Expansion).The 3rd floor which is a selection of the permanent collection had some iconic pieces which I appreciated. As I had already spent so much time in lines I chose not to go to the Cindy Sherman retrospective. That would have to be for another time.I really liked seeing where the collection is housed.One, it was REALLY hot. Why not put up some spritzers for those who have to line up in the sun. I am surprised no one's keeled over yet.I did find it puzzling that I had to line up twice. Once for the museum, and another time for the installation. With computers it would be easy enough just to ask people as they enter if they want to enter the installation and assign them a number or a time to enter. Takes fewer staffers anyway.Also, I parked at the Disney Hall but Broad wouldn't validate it. This isn't the Broad's fault but why don't all these places share their validation and their parking. Do they really expect that I am going to park once at the Broad and then get in the car and drive it across the street to Disney. Really? How L.A.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRKPinCH41
50,Fabulous Modern Collection,"Our first visit to the Broad, especially went for the Cindy Sherman exhibit. At $12, it was well worth it and the works were displayed well. One suggestion, make the print on the walls bigger! Had to wait at every one for people to clear out so could get up close enough to read the excellent information. Come on, 30 year old installers, get your Mom or Dad in to help you select a type size. The layout is excellent, and the line to get tickets ""same day"" went smoothly and surprisingly fast. The galleries upstairs were well laid out and the collection is a strong representation of contemporary art. Not always speaking to me, but clearly the work of committed collectors and our thanks to the Broads for donating this treasure.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DrZ63
40,"I am Not the Biggest Fan of Art, But","I am not the biggest fan of art, but I enjoyed this museum.I suppose one would call the Broad Collection, Modern Art.The collection is interesting, thought provoking and sometimes vulgar.I found myself asking, how did they do this or that. I am often as interested in the technique used in creating or assembling a piece of art as I am in its artistic value.I must say that the building itself was a big part of experience and what I said about the art holds true for it as well.The entire museum can easily be viewed in a couple of hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kenmO7019MI
50,Great museum of modern art!,One of the best museums of modern art I ever visited! Free attendance. I've booked tickets in advance on a website.Download museum's app In advance and enjoy the audio guide with your own headset!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Doctor328

50,Exceptional!,"The building itself is eye-catching. The collection is eclectic and fun. We enjoyed it very much. I recommend getting tickets far in advance so that you don't have to wait in line. I was surprised that there is not more to see. If you're at The Broad, it's worthwhile going to the Disney Concert Hall next door, even if there is not a performance. The architecture and gardens are beautiful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wuvhawaii
10,Don't want visitors from abroad?!?,"We are traveling California for a couple of weeks, during our trip we are visiting LA for a couple days. Really stupid we can't get any tickets for tomorrow; tickets have to be booked in advance.....The most foreigner-unfriendly museum we ever found on our travels (all over the planet....)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dutchbuddies
30,Too little payoff for all that hype,"The building is stunning, but it is supposed to be about art, not about how great the building is. That's the best thing I can say about my visit to the Broad, that the building is amazing. The art? Please! This is second-tier art. Granted it is a private collection, so perhaps ought not to be subject to harsh criticism, yet it is open to the public, so I guess it's fair game. The art is just not worth: a) the hype; b) the drama to get tickets; c) the long wait if you don't have a reservation (I did have tickets that I bought in the THRIVING secondary market for the Broad). Is it worth visiting? I don't think so, but the crowds prove me wrong, I guess. Disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LATraveller77
40,The Infinity Exhibit Is Worth the Trip!,"So our friend scored some free tickets to the The Broad Art Museum in downtown L.A. If you're into modern art, then you'll like The Broad. Warhol and contemporaries line the walls. Some very nice and interesting pieces. I'm not really into modern art so I cannot give you an objective review of the art.However, the Infinity Mirrored Room is totally awesome! It is something you have never seen before and well worth the visit to The Broad. It is so popular that it has it's own reservation and wait line. And you can only make reservations at the kiosk inside the museum and then wait for your turn. Depending what day you visit, it may take an hour or more wait. And they only allow one or two (your partner) to enter the exhibit and you only get to stay inside for 45 seconds. I have never seen anything like it before. It is truly incredible and worth the trip in and of itself. It will end this year so see it if you can.I've attached photo but it does not capture the true look and feel.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ralphh909
50,My new favorite museum in LA,"It's not very large but has a great collection. The line is long, about an hour long, but when you think that there are some lines at Disneyland where you wait for an hour for a 30s ride, then this is not so bad... It's a very friendly museum, great to bring teenagers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilafajl
50,Museum itself is a work of art!,Amazing! We love The Broad. Go to the website to get general admission Tix (which is FREE!) unfortunately it's very hot so they sell out fast! So we decided to pay $12 (free for kids) for the current exhibition of Cindy Sherman. It's worth it so you don't have to stay in the long line. As soon as you get there make sure to go to the queue line for the Infinity Room! It's a magical 45 seconds!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/judibootyt
40,modern art,You can make on line reservation for free tickets.But still you have to wait in lines before you can get inside.Funny experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kcwyhoney
20,The scarcity of tickets does not equal the experience…,"From the moment I tried to reserve tickets to The Broad, I was not impressed with the experience and ultimately, the museum. You must reserve tickets one month in advance of your visit on The Broad’s website (tickets go on sale at noon on the first of the month). Fine, I logged on and got the spinning wheel of death for 15 minutes. I finally had to call The Broad for assistance and they gave me an entirely different web address to reserve tickets than what was listed on their home page or reminder email. By the time I logged on, the earliest reservation I could get was for 12:30pm on a Saturday in June. Fine, tickets reserved.Parking can be found at The Broad for $12.00 on the weekend (same as LACMA). We valeted by The Broad on Grand for about the same price. The tickets say to arrive early, promptly, blah blah blah, so we did. Even though our tickets were for 12:30pm, we did not enter the museum until 1:00pm. The museum has three floors (Ground: Infinity Room, Exhibit, Gift Shop; Second: Office Space, Curation, Classrooms; Third: Main Floor). When we walked in, we went straight to the Infinity Room Reservation iPad and found out the wait was five hours. Yes, FIVE HOURS by 1:00pm (the museum had only been open for three hours) so that was a big disappointment. The first floor was completely bare because the museum was between exhibits so we proceeded directly to the third floor. The space was much smaller than expected with really no organization (time period, artist, location) to the work and was a hodge-podge of styles, textures, displays. Only some of the works contain identifying plaques that detail the story around the piece while the museum relies heavily on their mobile app to give you a self-guided tour.I thought this would be a great museum for kids but was definitely mistaken. There were maybe two interactive pieces and docents at every turn warning people from getting too close to the exhibits (including an over-sized wooden table and chairs exhibit that you can walk under but not touch. Right.). We saw the whole museum in under a 1.5 hours (closer to 1 hour) and headed out to the Gift Shop. Again, I thought I could find some kid-related books or art kits, puzzles, etc. but found nothing for my friend’s children who made the trip out to the museum. It was one of the tiniest gift shops I have ever been in and was a complete let down.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Brooke_Hansohn
50,Making Modern Art Understandable,"If you want to get beyond Craig Damrauer's great summation ofModern Art = I could do that + Yeah, but you didn'tgo to the Broad. Make reservations, but standing in line isn't so bad. Get there early to get into the Infinity room. Reservations go fast. The layout of the museum and the pieces are amazing. It really helps to place the different era's of Modern Art in perspective. So, you can understand that no that is something I could not do even if it looks easy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/j_otter_1111
50,Great Exhibits of Modern Art,"We arrived here about an hour early. I would suggest arriving earlier. We got in, but not before sitting inthe hot sun for a while after the opening time. Bring sunscreen, water and an shade umbrella.We were able ot get late afternoon tickets to see the Mirror Room--special exhibit. They gave us a text message while we were eating lunch to say our time was in 10 minutes! Scary, but we made it. So, if they say 4 hours, figure a two hour wait time and be prepared to be close by after that.We loved some of the art works in the museum collections. But I think my favorite part as a former museum educator was seeing the behind the scenes collection storage area. Neat!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mama2potter
40,Reserve tickets ahead of time,"Checked online in the morning and they released tickets for that day, so got tickets for the day. It is actually pretty small - takes about 60-90 minutes to go through the whole free exhibit. The architecture is great, and you can see it from the outside. The main exhibit is on the 3rd floor. Take the stairs as you will get to see more of the building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/msa23_2000
40,"The Building or the Art, Which is Better","The Broad is the hot new museum in town and there is a high demand for tickets. My brother managed to get ten tickets and we all spent the day downtown. The building itself has a unique façade of perforated concrete in a wave pattern. The main gallery space on the third floor has skylights that allow in natural sunlight. The two main ways up are an escalator though a tunnel and a glass elevator. The second floor has storage, some of which can be seen from the stairs going down. I had seen many of the pieces before in the Broad gallery at LACMA but there are many new pieces as well. The first floor has the special exhibits.The L.E.D. Infinity light room on the first floor was quite interesting, although you need to reserve your space early since only one or two people can view it at a time and for only about 45 seconds. You step into the room, the door closes, and you are surrounded by L.E.D.s hanging on wires surrounded by mirrors.While parking at The Broad may fill quickly, there is adequate parking surrounding.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KennethL828
40,Arrive early,We didn't have pre sale free tickets so we arrived prior to opening.The crowd wasn't bad. We parkw down the hill at a flat rate and had a nice day.The museum is large enough to handle flow.The architecture alone is worth the visit!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gatecrasher
40,The cool building is only the start,"Nice art, fun architecture all around. Get your free tickets in advance, or else the wait could be an hour on weekends. Smart tip: pay to go to the Cindy Sherman exhibit, and you not only see more great art, the line is shorter so you see more, faster. The admission price to the exhibit was well worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravenspadre
50,Great new addition to the LA Museum scene,"This new museum in downtown LA is fun and free. I really enjoyed the size, which is good but not overwhelming. Mostly modern art, very nicely displayed. It is free to get in, but they do regulate the flow so either get your tickets on-line ahead of time or expect to wait in line. When I went they had just opened, so I don't know how much of a variety there will be in the collection as time goes on but I know they have a lot of art. The building is built in such a way that as you go up the escalator, you pass part of the art storage area, which also has some art displayed. It's pretty cool to think that this is a private collection of the Broad's!Also, when I visited there was a cool installation of mirrors and light. That was also free but an additional reservation time which you could make when you entered the museum.I look forward to returning to this museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatAtHome
40,Contemporary Art inside out...,"Finally got to see this place! It took us almost a year to do it... We tried trying our luck before by just going there but the line was soooo looong... I suggest that you reserve tickets online. They usually open the reservation of tickets a month in advance.Parking is located at the basement. entrance is along 2nd street. Make sure to get a validation ticket to get $10 off of $22.There was a long cue for the advance tickets but we were able to go in quickly. Staff are friendly and helpful. Love the museum store too!We were not able reserve and see the Infinity room since we came in the afternoon. The special exhibition of Cindy Sherman was booked solid as well. (gives us another reason to comeback) - and make sure to reserve early!The main gallery is located on the third floor. All highlighted works of art can be found here. From Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Jasper Johns and more...my daughter loved the blue balloon dog... Just a reminder though that there is a portion of the gallery that is not suited for kids due to the content... A lot an hour or two for the visit",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tameia
40,Like a college survey course on contemporary art,"The Broad is definitely worth a visit, but it's not nearly as satisfying as many other museums. It's like an art snack that is tasty but doesn't leave you particularly satisfied. The collection is impressive, but there is so little gallery space that all you get are a few works from any one artist, which can make it hard to really understand the artist's point or view, artistic arc, or breadth of work. Some artists' work--Ellsworth Kelly comes to mind--was too cramped in the space to give it its due. So visit, but know that this is not MOMA, the Met or similar. I probably will not return just to visit the museum, but (see below) I will go for a special exhibition in the future.However, if the Cindy Sherman special exhibition is still showing when you intend to visit (until October 2, 2016), you ABSOLUTELY should get tickets for that. It was an unbelievable show and was in every way just the opposite of my general review of the museum. Lots of work that really showed Sherman's career. AMAZING. Tickets are $12 in advance (and you should get them in advance online beginning the first day of the month before you want to go), and the price includes entry to the museum, so you don't have to wait in line to see the rest of the museum. If you don't buy tickets in advance, you can show up and wait in the special exhibition stand-by line; they do let people in if ticket holders do not show up, but not very many. Showings are every half hour.Finally, the museum shop was only so-so. The shop at MOCA across the street is much better.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FussyGrl

30,"Interesting place, not worth all the hype","The Broad is really a fantastic museum, maybe one of the best of the west coast. However, it really doesn't deserve all of the hype it has been receiving. It's not worth the wait, the reservation or the constant headache of trying to get in to the museum that every wants to get in to. There are lots of other places that are much more entertaining and better ways to spend your day in LA. Also, kids will be bored out of their mind at the Broad, keep that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/288tylerd
40,Fun Modern Art Museum,"The museum is free. They want to regulate the flow of people; so get tickets in advance. They are available online on the 1st of the month at noon Pacific time, for the following month. Not sure why some people stood in line for a long time, unless they didn't have tickets. Our tickets were for 2:00 and we got there about 1:45. We chose 2:00 so we had time to have lunch at Grand Central Market, see Angel's Flight and the Bradbury Building. All of them are within walking distance of the Broad.The works are from the private collection of Eli & Edith Broad. It has more than 200 artists and holds a wide variety of art, as you'll see in my photos. If you don't enjoy modern art, don't go. If you do, you'll like the museum. On thing I really liked was the space given to each pieces. There's lots of room.The Broad is across the street from Disney Concert Hall. Make sure you go there too. They have a docent tour and an audio tour. We opted for the audio.The museum is close to the metro and is a couple of stops from the 7th street station.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SuzieeQ
50,Wow what a collection!,"This museum is spectacular. The collection is so large that the work shown on the 3rd floor is rotated. The architecture of the building is breathtaking. As you are heading up or down from the 3rd floor, you can view the stored pieces on the second floor through windows. We also visited the Cindy Sherman exhibit which was incredibly interesting and well curated. The tickets to the museum are free but you need to reserve ahead of time or stand on a line and just wait until they let you in. The Sherman exhibit was $12 but it also bought you access to the rest of the museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CuriousTraveler6

50,Groovy Artsy Fartsy Collection in a Magnificent Setting ?!,"We live in N Cali and are from NYC so we have seen our fair share of art museums and exhibits. This new museum and publically-shared collection is top notch and worth your time. Great exhibit with fairly deep representation of a number of important 20th century artists. Well curated with constantly changed pieces from their ridiculously large holdings (you can peer into their storage space in the stairwell) the staff was helpful and it is one of best modern art collections by a single collector, in a public space that I have experienced.

40,Very artsy morning.,"The Broad was a nice view into modern art. The Cindy Sherman exhibit was quite interesting. Talented and bazaar. Seems like the original ""selfie"" started a long time ago. Beautiful building. Nice flow to the exhibits. Fun and cultural day! Go if you are in town you won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Basays
50,Great day at the Broad,Went with my daughter and friend for my birthday. Didn't have reservations. Stood in the line where you could purchase tickets for $12/adult so it was quick getting in. Enjoyed it immensly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melissamac411
40,A Wonderful New Asset to LA which is FREE,"I finally made a visit to The Broad today after it has been open about tem months. Right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, next door to the Disney Concert Hall, Grand Park, the Music Center, MOCA, and City Hall. It was a gift from longtime philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad. The first floor has the main lobby, gift shop, and special exhibitions/installations. Currently featuring Cindy Sherman: Imitation of Life Highlights (which has a $12.00 upcharge but also allows access to the rest of the museum), and Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room: The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away. The second floor are administrative offices, workshop areas, collection storage, lecture hall, and storage for the collection. There are windows where you can look into the storage and prep areas. The third floor is the main galleries featuring works by Warhol, Lichtenstein, Koons, Basquait, Jasper Johns, and Ellsworth Kelly to name just a few.It is a small museum and takes about two hours to see and enjoy without being rushed. Since it is so new and popular there is a timed admission program. Simply on the 1st of every month you can confirm up to eight tickets for any day or time the following month. There is also a stand-by line for those without reservations but the wait can be well over an hour or two. As far as the Infinity Mirror room goes, once you get in the museum you simply follow the majority of entrants over to an iPad where you enter your name, cell number and number in your party. It gives you a return time and you simply show up and wait in a short line. I went with my sister on a Thursday. We had our reservations for opening at 11:00am. We were in the museum within ten minutes. Waited in the Infinity room sign-up line for about another ten minutes and were given a return time of 12:05 pm. We started touring the museum when my phone vibrated to alert me with a text, and we went to the Infinity room about 11:45. Then we say the rest of the exhibits. All in all we got there at 11am, got into the Infinity room at 11:55 and were done with our visit about 12:45pm. So it can all be done in a non-rushed casual pace. Just make reservations and have common sense. If you want to see the Infinity Room (I believe it's there till some time in October) get there early with a reserved time and head straight to the iPad station to sign-up. If you get there late and your Infinity appointment is hours away, you can leave the museum and when you get the text you can re-enter. We had no problem with any of it. I know some people have complained about the staff/guards watching you like a hawk. I saw nor experienced any of that. I even got quite close, inches away to look closely at some paintings and was never warned once. And while the museum and all it offers is free, we went by Metro Rail so nothing to pay as far as parking goes and no frustration of driving. It was a very enjoyable morning and afternoon with no expense other than lunch and Metro fare. Thank you Broad's!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Beachkidboy
50,Fun and interesting art!,Great museum and interesting exhibitions. Some displays a bit squeamish and not for the faint of heart. If you get tickets ahead of time wait time is non-existent otherwise you may get have to wait 2+ hours to get in. Nice photo ops once inside.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djdariusjoseph
50,"Free Admission, Great Artwork, Free Admission, Great Artwork, Infinity","We were pleased to visit The Broad in last month despite not having reservations. I must admit that we didn't want to wait 1 1/2 hours in the free entrance line to see the 3rd floor exhibit. It was well worth the $15 to wait only 30 minutes and experience the awesome photography of Cindy Sherman. Luckily, we only had to be put on a 2 hour wait list to experience the Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room which was pretty cool. The museum will text you when it's your turn to see it. We grabbed some food at Ocho Mexican Grill which was in walking distance as we waited for text. The museum's docents were all friendly. Most were art students and were very informative. I would highly recommend a visit to this museum next time you visit downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Unrestedmom1
40,The Broad,The Broad has some great pieces in the exhibit. The only downside is having to wait outside for 30 mins to get in. Worth checking out when in Los Angeles.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IAMTHETRAVELGOD
50,Great Contemporary Art Collection - FREE,Visit Eli Broad Collection at this stunning new museum in DTLA and the permanent collection is free to visit. Make a reservation for your timed visit.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travel4bourne
40,"Great museum, very long wait to get in.","Got there before opening hours during a week day and had to wait for over 2 hours. You need to count on being in line for quite a while. Once we were in, we were allowed to go out for lunch without losing our spot ( we were starving). There is another exhibit inside that you need to reserve in advance for, so we were not able to see it because it was so late. Paintings are very interesting, some of them we had already seen at an exhibit at Lacma. Regardless of the wait, it is a must visit site for all Los Angeles residents.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chatis75
50,An amazing museum,"I've been tried to visit The Broad since it opened, but my trips are usually booked at the last minute so I've been unable to purchase tickets. But they have added the standby line, so I took a chance on that. I went on a weekday when the wait is shorter. When I left the hotel, their Twitter feed said that wait was 40 minutes, and when I arrived they updated it to 10 minutes. I spent three hours there and I would have stayed longer, but I took so many pictures that my cell phone battery was almost depleted (you can't get an Uber with a dead battery). I will definitely visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FordGM
50,Gorgeous museum,"A friend of ours recommended we check out this Broad and we're very glad we did. We went on a Saturday, without reservations and were fully ready to wait in the standby line for an hour or two to get in. Luckily, we overheard one of the museum personnel explain to another couple in line that if we pay for the Cindy Sherman exhibit, we would only have to wait 30 minutes or so to get in, so of course we invested in the $12pp tix. And it was worth it. Not only to skip the line, but the exhibit was really good. We were not able to get into the infinity mirrored room (6 hour wait), but the rest of the regular exhibits were also amazing. If you like modern art, this is must do. And if you're an organized traveler, be sure to reserve tickets in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Littlemops
40,Tar pits.....,We were told by friends that the tar pits were not really worth the time but decided to go see them for ourselves......sadly they were right. I think a lot more could be done in making the pits worth a visit. The only highlight was seeing squirrels!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amanda1363
50,Must see for modern art lovers,"Must see for modern art lovers. The museum itself has a bold design with the perforated white exterior, whimsical cave-like stairwells, and open, expansive, light filled galleries. The art collection features instantly recognizable masterpieces that are frequently reproduced in art history textbooks as well as more recent works from current critical favorites. There is a satisfying variety of work on display (and it is my understanding that the displayed works will rotate over time), but viewers can easily take in all the art in one visit. Highly recommended. (I also strongly recommend reserving tickets in advance online as demand is very high right now!)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sheilastepsout
50,The Greatest Hits of Modern Art,"The Broad is a wonderful addition to the LA art scene. I really like the exterior of the building and the great lighting for the art on the third floor. The art is remarkably good, with remarkable works from a wide range of artists. Not everything is to my taste, but there are so many top-drawer pieces that make the visit worthwhile. There's parking below the museum that will cost you about $20. In the museum, there is really no place to sit or eat. It will take about an hour to see everything. You can stand on line for a walk-up ticket, or you can go online and get a ticket and then wait on a line to be let in. Or, you can pay $12 and get an online ticket for the special exhibit and walk right in. We saw the special exhibit of Cindy Sherman where she dresses up, gets made up to look like a variety of characters and then photographs herself. I don't know what anyone sees in it. In any case, I'd get the tickets that allow you to just walk in and then skip the Sherman exhibit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaTraveler7777
50,Great collection in an amazing building,"Went to The Broad for a special exhibition but also for the permanent collection, with great artwork from the 20th century. Also the building in itself is a must see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sergio_Nogueira
50,Fantastic,"Great bulldog, great exhibition, great locations. Fully recommend this if you are downtown LA. I walked there from my hotel and was able to is the free exhibition lane which was fantastic",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/El_expl0rad0r
50,Good contemporary art museum,"If you are into contemporary art, you will probably like it.If you are not, go to Getty instead.Their collection is just the right size, not too big nor small.Once you get in, a couple hours should be enough.It's free, but since it just opened last fall, you WILL be waiting in the lines, even if you were lucky enough to have reserved advance tickets online.My advices:1) Consider paying $12 to get in, and check out the special exhibition, it will save you time.2) If you go by car, park at The California Plaza (entrance on Olive St.) and get validated for $8 a day3) Might as well visit nearby MOCA if you've parked at the california plaza!While you are at it, visit the nearby MOCA Geffen (either walk 20 mts or go by car & park nearby in Little Tokyo), which I thought was much more interesting than the one on Grand!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chia2005
40,Art in LA,"The Broad was across the road from my hotel so I was able to stop by in between meetings. The building itself is beautiful, making the visit worth doing just for that reason. The art is modern and eclectic and includes several familiar, iconic pieces (Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol - there was also a show of Cindy Sherman work on when I visited)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TObiker
50,Nice addition to the museum scene,The museum is not too big and not too small. We bought timed tickets to the exhibition that includes general admission. When we left it looked like the line for those who hadn't purchased tickets in advance was a few hours long.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonBumblebee
30,Long wait despite reservation,"We got finally in, but were not really impressed with the exhibit. May be we just don't connect well with modern art?! Some pictures and photos are definitely not for small kids, be aware!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/UlrikeZ280
30,Right now it's too much about the event and not about the art.,"As of June 26, 2016, The Broad suffers from way too much hype and way too little organization. At this moment it's like a new restaurant that does not have it's act together. If you have a reservation, fine, go. If not, just don't. The exhibit is not worth the wait - yes I found it entertaining once inside, a nice cross-section of modern, a few examples per artist, interesting for an hour +, or about half the time I waited to get in.The staff and check-in is cumbersome and clueless at best. They insist on an email then print a receipt from a little printer strapped to the waist, but wait, then they have to scan the receipt to let you in (after two hours in my case). They do very little to clarify the wait time except tell you they're much busier than they expected?? Oh and with only five people ahead of me to get in, the frustrated couple behind me got out of the ""free"" line went to another line, paid $12 and got right in. NOWHERE was that option made available online or on sign. I would have done that in a heartbeat.One last note, for a new building, the floor of the third floor gallery is a mosaic of cracked concrete. Given the hype of the building design they should have given some more attention to the quality. Already aged. Now head right into the Disney escalator tunnel, Jeff Koons awaits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gordon5656
40,Beautiful new museum with friendly attendants!,"The line still wraps around the blck for admission to this great new free museum. It's a bit of a process to get the reserved free tickets. At latest, they release tix for the month at noon on the first day of the month. Three of us wanted to go together on a certain day so each of us were in front of our computers at the deadline & only one of got tix for the day & time we wanted. It was worth it. The architecture is fab - great contrast to the Disney Hall across the street - collection is very modern - the attendants were friendly & enthusiastic. We met Jesse on the 3rd floor & any questions she couldn't answer off the top of her knowledgeable head she looked up on her tablet computer.The Infinity Room is worth the wait! Made my visit!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justbetweenyouandme
50,Had to check out The Broad!,"I love Museums, so this definitely made the list. Great collection of Contemporary Art (Basquiat, Warhol, Koons). I really wanted to visit the infinite room as well, but all the tickets had been sold that day. Wish there was more room for art 'cause I could have spent all day there, but it was definitely worth the trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MontrealCanadian
50,Great contemporary,"What an interesting building with an interesting history even though it is relatively new. Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha are among the many artists on display.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninab301
40,Rare Free Art Museum,"Get your free tickets online before going. I heard that you may have to stand in line for a long time, but for us it was only 1/2 hour. Because of construction, we only got to see one floor, but the little that we did see was mostly conceptual and/or abstract. This was not a traditional art museum. The modern outside gives you an idea of what's inside. I think that if I went again, I would take a guided tour so that I could get into the thoughts of the artist.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Mauty
30,The broad,"This is the place for abstract modern contemporary art. The pricing is reasonable and the best exhibit is the infinity mirrored room. It is an exhilarating room to be in, however since it is so small, you only get 45 seconds to stand in the room. Not many people get to enter this exclusive room since the wait is long. If you want to go into it, you have a better chance if you get there earlier. To me the Cindy Sherman exhibit wasn't a special interest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hongw360

50,Wow,"Make sure you reserve your tickets on their website so that you know exactly when you can go. Advise to go as early as possible and sign up for the infinity room, near the entrance. The building is as unique as the art. Take your time and enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Trekduet
50,Modern Art reflecting a family's passion and vision in a unique setting,"If you like modern art, you must visit this museum. The Broad family's collection has expanded into one of the best we have ever seen, and it is displayed in an architecturally superb setting. I recommend taking a guided tour. You won't be disappointed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/96ralphd
40,It's free if you like to wait in lines,The Broad Museum is a wonderful contemporary designed museum that showcases all the best and creative artists in the 20th and 21st centuries. The Cindy Sherman exhibition was going on and there was a separate fee for that. The collections are a wide breath by each artist and each is given there own room display. On a Sunday it is especially nice as it is quiet and you have plenty of time to walk around.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R4960NKjustinw
50,Breathtaking collection of contemporary art,"If you enjoy contemporary art, and frankly even if you don't, this museum should be on your list. The architecture alone is worth the visit, but the collection of paintings, sculpture and other media will leave you in a state of wonder.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carolhN5654UE
50,Free admission,"Modern Art Museum you must see, but arrive before the line gets too long so you don't have to wait too long to get in. There is one room in particular you won't want to miss and you have to sign up to get into it, then it may take another hour to get into it but trust me it is so worth it and you don't have to wait in line for it you can view the rest of the installations before you go back to the Infinity Room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/192illag
30,Cool but eh...,"The Broad was a very cool to see-I have heard such good things about it! But, as with so many things in LA, if you don't make a reservation (for the Infinity Room), you won't get in. Big disappointment. I was able to see the rest of the museum, which was very interesting and had some great things to see. But overall: a disappointing visit. And there is almost nothing else to do around the area in DTLA. Save your time and money and go to the Natural History Museum or the Science Center.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/napakettu7
40,Fantastic experiences at the Broad,Right now the Broad has two very interesting exhibitions: one is Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirrored Room; the other photographer Cindy Sherman’s Imitation of Life. Both are special. The Infinity Mirrored Room takes one or two people at a time onto a small platform surrounded in a small room where hundreds of lights are hanging and what seems like dozens of mirrors are reflecting that light. It is at once gazing into deepest space and at the same time looking at the traffic lights of LA from high on the hills above the city. Disconcerting and remote. Cindy Sherman is an artist who photographs herself in poses typically or media influenced gender roles. She is questioning but not very confronting. Well worth the experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JohnSB3
50,A Must Do in Los Angeles,"We were in LA this past weekend and we were really looking forward to see Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. It was an endless LED display and you have only 45 seconds to enjoy it. While waiting for our appointed time, we planned on how we are going to enjoy the experience.We did not have a reservation and we were ready to stand in line to get an appointed time. As we were standing in the hot sun, one of the employees for the museum suggested that we stand in line for the Cindy Sherman exhibit which will cost $12. a person and the wait is not as long and also we didn't have to stand in the hot sun. Boy, it was worth it. We got to get in sooner and enjoyed all the modern art display. There were three Murakami walls that we really enjoyed and of course the Cindy Sherman exhibit was great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yatsivad5

20,"If this is art, I'm a Martian","Ok. I'm an art lover and collector. I love the Getty, LACMA, you name it. I've never been to a museum I didn't like - until now.GORGEOUS architecture. THAT being said, and with a (very) few exceptions, THIS IS NOT ART. This is garbage. Like a trip to a Kindergarten arts and crafts class. (no disrespect meant to kindergartners, who are FAR superior artists than you'll find here).I don't know who buys the art, or decides what to show, but, if it's the curator, he/she should be tarred and feathered and displayed as ""art"".",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffB45
40,Overwhelming!,"The Broad's years of collecting contemporary artists can be shared and enjoyed by all. This is an amazing museum, with enormous 82 foot long works by Murakami, as well as huge installations of modern art.

50,Beautiful Modern Museum with Fabulous Art,"The Broad is a beautiful new museum with a fabulous collection of modern art. I was thrilled to see some of the pieces on display as they were definitely at the top of my art bucket list. The 3rd floor art display is well lit by natural light and the arrangement gives ample space for optimal viewing. Be sure to peek in at the second floor on your way down the stairs to see a glimpse of how the non-exhibited parts of the collection are stored. General admission is free, but I'd highly recommend reserving in advance through their website.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/luv2takepics
40,Well worth it!,I am not an art lover and i still really enjoyed this visit. Unfortunately we had to wait in a queue outside.

Definitely must do in LA.See my photos.The actual building is impressive on its own.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/822philipb
50,Infinity,"Great collection of contemporary art from different years and various styles. The wait time for the ""Infinity Room"" is not as daunting, since you don't have to be physically present at the museum to pass the time. Also, the wait time is an estimate, so it is actually much shorter that what the iPad tells you. Just make sure to get to the museum early enough (before 11:30 - noon) to book your spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/vbutrimova

40,Interesting ... Different ... Worth One Visit,"As advertised, not your standard art museum. These are different works of art in varied media. All very colorful, fascinating, some strange, all interesting. A great date event (i.e., take your girlfriend, walk around for an hour, and you have stuff to talk about afterwards). And it's free !! Can't beat that!Lots of places to eat nearby. Just plan ahead for the tickets and how it will fit into your day because it will take just an hour. Quite nice for this philanthropist to house his own collection in such an architecturally significant building and make it available to the general public at no charge. We should all be so generous in some way in our lives.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgY8891TF
30,Interesting modern art but limited,"This is an interesting museum -- nice collection of modern art. But it's very small, and being focused on modern pieces, many of the exhibits are a bit silly. For example, there's a room with a giant table and chairs, accompanied by a rather confusing statement from the artist about why that is meaningful art. It's not all like that -- there are a few nice Warhol pieces -- but many other pieces were not artistically significant.It's true that part of the fun in going to a museum is judging for yourself whether a particular piece is artistically significant and if so how. But this museum seemed to have a lot of pieces that were more ""pranks"" or funny objects than serious art. Not a bad way to spend some time but not a ""must see"" museum either.As a free museum, visitors are required to queue up for a fair bit before being allowed into the museum. Not sure why -- it seemed like a waste of time, and there didn't seem to be any option of making a donation if you don't want to wait. Not a big deal, but I hope museum management will consider just letting people in when they arrive. The place wasn't busy at all when I finally got it, so it seemed as though they were making us wait around for no reason.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jjhughes3
50,Great Museum! Excellent Collection!,"I was there late in the afternoon visiting the Disney Musical Hall and wasn't aware of the existance of the museum. Spoke with someone of the staff and she told me there was a 2 hour line and you had to make a reservation for tickets. I only had planned this day in LA downtown and she walked away to get me a ticket! Awesome! The museum building and the collection were more than I expected, great experience going up, and the collection was amazing. Really enjoyed the time I spend there!

By 11:30 we were still outside in the hot sun (could they supply some benches or shade?) so checked the web site and the last tweet said '2 hour wait'. So we bailed, and paid $12 to park for nothing.

50,Amazing and totally worth going early to get tickets,We went for my daughter's 21st bday. (She is an art history major! And my family all enjoys going to art museums in general.) We didn't have tickets. We went on a Wednesday and arrived at 1015 and got in with the 1st group at 11:10. We immediately got logged in for the line where they text you when it is your turn for the mirror - totally worth it! I'm not a huge contemporary art buff but this exhibit was all the contemporary artist I knew!! The design of the building is like none other. You actually get to see where they store the extra art. It is hard to believe this is someone's personal collection!!This is on my short list of favorite museums!! I can't wait to go again!!Don't miss the restaurant either!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mgordon713
20,Book ahead or forget it.,"Our hosts in LA recommended the Broad highly and we decided to take a chance and go. We were told we needed to get in early to catch a spot in the walk-in line. We reached at 9.45 am for a 11 Am opening and the line was already around the building! we reached the entrance at around 12. We were then told that the highlight exhibit - the infinity room had another line and a time would be allotted to us. So we stood in another line ( 20 min more) and got an entry time of 415 PM!so a walk in attempt to see the broad will take away your entire day, not a happy thought for visitors with limited time on their hands and the whole city to see.sadly we decided that there was much more we could do in the 4 hours and left.Maybe the next time we will have better luck.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/758shivs
50,Coolest Modern/Contemporary Art Museum on the West Coast,"This museum is popular. Book advance tickets online if possible. If you can't do that, do what I did. I woke up early on a Sunday morning and arrived at 8:45 AM. There was already a stand by line and the museum was scheduled to open at 10AM. Once 10AM came around, I was in the first group they let in from the stand by line. As soon as I got in, I signed up for the Infinity Room. They send you a text when it's your turn. To be perfectly honest, the Infinity Room is overrated. All you do is stand on a ledge for 45 seconds and take pictures. It's pretty yes but it's not the end of the world if you miss it. The rest of the museum is awesome. The lighting is perfect. The art is unique and cool. The building is modern and unusual. It's a great way to spend the afternoon. Did I mention it's free? It's an LA must see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sdbooklover13
40,"Great exhibit, poor visitor management","It is not a large exhibit space, but the works are excellent. One of the best small collections I've seen. But their advance ticket management is constructed for their convenience, not for their visitors'. Hard to believe, but advance ticket bookings are only available from the first day of each month for the following month, and only the following month. So booking any day in July can only be done from June 1 onward, but on June 1 you can't try to book even June 30th, or any day in August, or later in the year. If your planning doesn't accommodate this scheme, you will have to wait in the general admission line - in my case, 1 hour and 30 minutes from the time doors were opened on a Thursday. Forewarning to future visitors and a note to management that this is not a good system - for the visitor, anyway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stropht
50,Great Intro to Contemporary art,"As a new art museum goer, I really enjoyed the collection. It had a great mix media and some interactive pieces. Loved it and will take out of town guests there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/844sharlar
50,Amazing collection in a wonderful building.,"Here's the deal: The Broad entrance fee is free, but in order to walk in you need a reservation, however dates are already booked months ahead. Thus, you need to wait in a walk-up line if you want to visit sooner. We knew the situation and were prepared to wait, which for us took about an hour on a Saturday afternoon. The wait was well worth it! Right now there is a new exhibit being installed on the main floor, but the third floor collection was more than ample. The collection is comtemporary, varied, and eclectic. I found some of the pieces to be absolutely spectacular, others not so; but that is par for the art museum course in my experience. All pieces are from the Eli and Edythe Broad private collection of more than 2000 items. Apparently they will be rotated every few months so what I saw you might not so I will not go into the details other than to mention that multi works from many supestars of the contempary period are on display. The building has a unique architecture which includes some interesting views of parts of Disney Hall and lots of natural indirect light. Enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorne29
50,A Broadway Spectrum,"Had the opportunity to attend the Broad Museum during April, and was impressed with the wonderful art work. I am not a museum person, and this was new and local trendy art. A lot of young people in attendance, great food in the near area. I say visit, explore and have a great time",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melanieb69

40,Nice but too long of a wait,"We waited in line 1hr 20 min. It took 1 hour to go through the whole museum. Then you have to enter your name and phone number to enter a special exhibit called 'infinity mirrored room'. We had a 3 1/2 hour wait for that. So we left the museum and walked to Tokyo town - ate sushi and returned. We were allowed 45 SECONDS in the exhibit. It was really cool but .... 45 seconds is not enough time for an art display. The other art throughout the Broad was interpretive and some I thought ""I could have done this"". It was ok but won't go again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TerryM111
40,Extraordinary Art Collection,"Mainly american modern classical artists such as Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Liechtenstein, Andy Warhol to the newer Basquiat, Haring & Koons in a extraordinay space, excellent curation. Also some objects of german Joseph Beuys.The architecture of the museum is stunning. Dont miss the infinite mirror room. The only downpoint was the rude way of how they close the museum and literally kicked us out 5 min before closing...lack of education.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PhoenixSaoPaulo
50,Really interesting museum and its free!,"Last month my husband and I visited this museum along with our daughter and her boyfriend. Now I must admit that we don't usually seek out contemporary art, but having heard so much about the Broad, I knew we had to visit. Its necessary to make your reservation several weeks in advance. But the reservation system does guarantee that the place isn't mobbed, so I appreciate the process. And who can complain when a world class museum is free?The art was great. I didn't realize how many contemporary artists I recognized, and how much I do enjoy this genre of art. And the Broad building was designed specifically for display of this art.Whether or not you think you like contemporary and modern art, I definitely recommend at least one visit here. I know I plan to go back soon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WendyL963

50,One of a kind,"There's probably too much hype right now, as the lines are super long (in my opinion). We were lucky enough to see the museum at 11:00 pm on the closing night of the inaugural exhibit. The museum closed at midnight. No lines and the place was almost empty. This is great for everyone (kids, families, dates, or go solo). It's easy to spend the afternoon/evening here. The staff are super helpful. Check in the LED illuminated room and they'll text you when to get back in line. It's truly a fun, edgey, swank, contemporary museum with great pieces. Got to see some of my favorite artists. Love the culture! There's an app you can download and do your own self guided tour. All the exhibit's info is on this app.We didn't eat there, but the food options looked pretty good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Islanddiva7
50,Fabulous new museum on Bunker Hill,"The interior of this museum is spectacular and the collection is shown in a very edgy, fun to digest way.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/772kyungy
50,Go in the afternoon without reservations,Reservations fill up quickly and so we played our hand by showing up around 3pm when most people were leaving and go in without waiting in line. This was a thursday and not a weekend. Of course the museum was great with perhaps the best collection of US modernists ever assembled. I think there are over 2000 pieces in the collection with some 100 or so on display. Many of the great pieces are on loan. Reservations can be had but only 1 month in advance and they sell out quickly. there is no charge for entering the museum with or without a reservation.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tfizzle
30,"Long wait, still fun","We arrived about 9:45, and waited outside for about 2 hours to get in on a Tuesday. I had my 9 and 13 year old girls with me and they wanted to give up waiting a few times, but we waited anyway. Once inside we headed inside we went straight over to get on the wait-list for the mirrored room, but it was completely full for the day. Bummer! We had a good time checking out the exhibits, and we spend a while in a room of videos. We only spent about 1-2 hrs total in the museum which was sad, because we waited longer than that to get in. We saw everything, and may have hung around longer, but after standing for 2 hours just to get in, and then another hour or two on our feet in the museum, we were hungry and needed to sit a bit. All in all, it was a pretty cool museum with some neat pieces. It will be nice when the place isn't so new and you can get in easier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/angieh460

50,Brilliant Architectural Experience,Extraordinary collection housed in magical building with surprise designs everywhere. You must see the Mirror Room. Advance admission tickets required,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lurkinc
50,Absolutely must visit,"Everything about this museum is amazing except for the wait times. Museum opens at 10 AM on a Sunday and we reached around 9:45 AM. Onsite ticketing line was pretty big and we got into the museum around 11:45.To the left of the hall, there is an IPad where you can add your name to see the infinity mirrored room ( the main reason why you need to arrive before the museum opens). We had about 3.5 hrs wait for that!The museum itself is not very big so you'll finish seeing everything in 1-2 hrs. I would suggest that you start from the 3rd floor. Even if you don't get to see the infinity mirrored room, it's totally worth the visit.As long as you have your ticket, you can go out and come back when it's your time to join the queue to see this room. For me, this was totally worth the hype.Infinity room is on the first floor near the elevator. When the door opens to the infinity mirrored room, you get a glimpse of it if you really want to see and aren't lucky to get into the room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mamthaaa

40,Love what you've done with the place Eli,"Eli Broad and his wife Edythe have given us a new museum in Los Angeles Upper Grand Ave making this street just ooze of culture. I loved the current exhibit and was looking forward to the infinity room but the wait was 4 hours. It was so disappointing, but I understand the demand is high. That was point 5 of 5 but everything else is totally available to see now. A must if you are visiting, and absolute must if you are a Local.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hectorh865
50,"Great art, great museum","These folks really do it right...large gallery spaces, helpful staff, and an organized way to get tickets. Plus it's free! Make sure you reserve your spot for the infinity room as soon as you get there because it may be several hours before you can return. It moves fast, though, and they really do their best to accommodate you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jperoni
50,WONDERFUL MODERN ART MUSEUM,"The newest art museum in Los Angeles County.Special exhibit is the Infinity Mirrors. Sign up for this free unique exhibit oftwinking lights, mirrored walls and a 45 second visit only!! Very intense. The modern art museum has a large collection ofof well known artists such as Andy Warhol and many otherartists and works you will immediately recognize and feel fortunate to see in person. Located next to Disney Hall with a unique architecture of its own. Free admission, but reservationsrecommended",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ARLENEB710
50,LOVE,This is one of the best collections I've ever seen!! The building itself is amazing. One of my fav things about LA!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bizoub
40,It's worth a visit!!,"I did not do my homework, so I could not pre-book tickets to get in. However, the standby line was not so bad on the Tuesday I visited. The wait outside was about half an hour.Now, the building itself is a piece of art. The facade decorates the building, shields the interior from the sun, and uses these openings to channel sunlight into the building in a diffused manner. It's bright and airy inside on the top floor, but it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable at all. You really have to see it to appreciate it!The museum is not the biggest out there, but the exhibits were pretty cool, and there was a piece I find a little controversial. LOL! Of all the exhibits, there was one that really impressed me and also touched my heart. It was ""The Visitors"" by Ragnar Kjartansson. I really recommend spending the time to see it from start to finish. The execution was different and quite clever actually. I won't go into detail as I think finding out for yourselves may increase the wow factor!There is also the infinity mirrored room, which I did not get to see. You have to sign up when you get there, and spaces are very limited. I did not get to experience it, so I can't tell you if its worth seeing. I'll let you be the judge on this one!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/VincentN640
50,Fun,Nice variety of modern and pop art culture. It's fun and relaxed environment. Free entry which is rare in LA. Parking is kinda expensive in the near area. The gift shop has cool stuff at medium prices.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucass540
50,Awesome Art Museum,Absolutely one of the most fantastic art museums that I have ever been to.Art from Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol. ...just awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/toni861
50,"Beautiful building, wonderful art. Here are my tips:","I parked in front of Walt Disney Concert Hall (a block away) which is $18 for longer than 1:30 hrs. I think that was really pricey but I wasn't sure where else I could have found a better place.Arrived to The Broad on a Thursday at 10:55am. The stand by line was almost a block long. The wait feels long but it moves faster than I thought. The lady told us that every half hour the doors opened for the people that reserved their space. I think about 250 people can get in at a time so if only 200 with reserved space gets in at 11:00 then they let 50 stand-bys in. We got in around 12:40.The mirror room is the reason why most people go, including me. There's an iPad right outside the room where you sign up. Only one person at a time can go in and they are given 45 seconds. Because of this, the wait line by the time I got into the museum was 297 minutes. Given, we didn't go in.Great news: after the museum we went to Starbucks a couple of blocks away and when we walked back, around 2:30pm there were no stand by lines. This is a great time to come!!!I will definitely come back on my next trip to LA and I recommend people to come as well. You'll love this place.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mariangiec
40,Beautiful Building!,"Was excited to finally visit The Broad Museum in downtown L.A. Arrived end of day on a Friday and happily didn't find much of a crowd or lines. After a short wait, we were allowed in and immediately took the long escalator up to the top where the exhibits mostly are. The modern artwork was a great sprinkling of various modern artists including Warhol, Ruscha and Rauschenberg but with such few art pieces from each, it was hard to delve into any one artist sufficiently to get a real sense of them. Still, it was an enjoyable visit and always fun to see the masterful contemporary artists at their best. Unfortunately, we were unable to get tix for the Rain Room which would have been really interesting to experience. Do visit the video installation downstairs if you get a chance. If you visit, do walk around the corner and enjoy Otium Restaurant after - stellar!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WestsideL
50,Get there before 1000 am,"For guaranteed stand by tickets for 1100 or plan ahead and book 2 months out (if those time slots aren't already taken). Entry is free. Bring something to eat & drink while you wait (no food/drink allowed inside), music, a book, and an umbrella for the sun. Amazing place though- very fun and unique. Would go back to see different pieces they rotate out (if they did that, I'm not sure, but they have a huge collection). I highly recommend but just be prepared either way. (PS: pronounced ""brode"")",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mizeryztool
50,The Broad Museum,"Our visit to The Broad was even better than I expected. The artwork was well laid out, and the whole first floor was devoted to newer artists, many of which I had never heard of. I like that the Broads are supporting newer artists. The Infinity Room is not to be missed. Enquire as soon as you enter about signing up for a time to enter this special exhibit. It's worth the wait. I was especially impressed with the guards in each room of the museum, because they are all art or art history students or practitioners who are trained down to the last detail to answer any question you have about any art piece. I've never encountered that in any other museum I've ever visited. Go and enjoy!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurieg686
40,"Cool, hip space","Very nice, new museum.We went during it's opening phase when they had timed tickets - I'm not sure if that is still going on.They have a lot of good, crowd drawing / photogenic pieces. Totally worth a trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/626alexm626
50,Must see!,"Excellent collection of art! Has works by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Barbara Kruger, Jeff Koons, Basquiat, the list goes on! Great mix of sculptures, paintings, to almost every other medium. Even if you're not an art lover, it is still incredible to see. Would recommend booking tickets, though, especially if you want to see Yayoi Kusama's infinity room - spaces can fill up within an hour of the gallery opening.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/christmas-enthusiast
50,A masterpiece of individual taste,"I've found in all of my visits to museums around the world, the most outstanding ones are the reflection of individual taste. The Guggenheim museum in Madrid has always been my favorite, but now I have another one--The Broad in LA.This is a day trip. The entrance is free, but you must make a reservation online. Check everything out carefully on their website first. You'll have a great experience if you follow the instructions.The art is something to see and it's some of the best from the personal collection of Mr and Mrs Broad. They have been collecting for the last 45 years.There's a good gift shop in the museum. The restaurant is tops, although when I tried to book lunch, there was nothing available for just around 45 days! So, if you would like to go there, plan ahead.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dlwintermia
50,"Book way, way in advance","This is a MUST see for any art lovers.Missed out on getting advanced tickets online during my stay in LA, so my first advice is to book way in advance. Luckily when I went the line was semi-short, so I only waited for 20-30 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. What a fantastic collection! So lucky to see works for all my favorite artists in one place. My second advice is to also secure your place in the queue for the Infinity Room. I missed out on this because by the time I went to sign up it was booked for the day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaggieR525
50,Contemporary art is inspiring!,"In planning my visit (I recommend going to website to book reservation) I thought I would not be inspired by more modern work, but there were such interesting, provocative and engaging works, I will go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ariess631
10,A Must see IF you can get a ticket,"The Broad is a must see attraction when in LA, and it is free to boot. But the problem is that getting a ticket is impossible. I would rate this 5 star had I not had the experience that I am about to describe.A trip to LA was planned months in advance. Not knowing tickets were impossible to get, we tried about 3 weeks in advance. Nothing. So we called the concierge of the hotel we were staying at and she told us that the only way to get in was by booking with an art tour company at $150 per ticket. She said that it should not be this way, but if we really wanted to go, that that was the only way. We did since we do not get to LA that often and really wanted to see the Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room as well as the permanent collection. We were happy to pay the price. We are on the mailing list of the Broad so the afternoon before our entrance, tickets suddenly became available and we booked 2 online for the next morning. When we told the concierge to cancel, we were told that there was a 24 cancellation policy and the tour company immediately hit our credit card for $300. When we got to the Broad, it appears that you can leave the facility and just show your ticket and gain re-entry. I am wondering if this is why the tour company had us scheduled for the afternoon so that they could reuse their tickets. Rumor has it that this company has some inside contacts to get tickets. So while we thought the museum which should be FREE was great, games get played. But I do say go if it is possible to get in, as this is one fine museum and the Broads have a wonderful collection. And what was on display is just a fraction of what is there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MisterKenn
40,Price is right,"I sat down and with a little planning 6-8 weeks ahead of time, I was able to secure a reservation for two at the Broad on a Tuesday afternoon through the web site. With a reserved entry time and printed ticket, it was a breeze to enter the museum even 10 minutes late. Non-reservation guest were qued for entry as well, but I'm not sure what their wait time entailed. Non-flash photography is allowed and back packs must either be hand-carried or worn on your chest while visiting. The number of visitors was substantial but not overwhelming making the reservation system an effective method of attendance control. The Infinity room was already full booked for the day upon our entry. The only real stressor was parking. By time we arrived at the Broad, the on site structure was full. Alternative parking sites are suggested, including the California Plaza with the entry off Olive between 2 and 3rd. Entrance is a little non-desrcript and under the overpass structure. The parking rate is $39 but with validation from the Broad, the flat rate payment is only $8. Just ask for a validation card upon entry to the museum from a staff member that you will use at the autopay station at the parking structure, which is located at the Omni hotel / Museum of Contemporary Art side of Grand, and a short walk to the Broad entrance. After the museum visit, which took us only about 75 minutes, a walk to the Grand Central Market for coffee and snack. The late afternoon hour was a nice time to explore the Market since there were no crowds and you had the luxury to check out all the vendors and amenities. Overall, this was a very nice way to take a 3 hour break on a weekday afternoon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/374calvine
50,Worth the long wait!,"This art museum is great. It has a lot of interesting pieces. I would say if you are into art, definitely stop here and The Getty Center. Both have an impressive collection.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kayla_Chrisman
40,hooray for the Architect!,"The architecture is a whole show, too! The design and lighting is unique. Who could image Veil and Vault could be so much fun. The first floor special opening exhibit is excellent! My favorite Ragnar Kjartansson, the Visitors was a treat. The permanent collection is up on the third floor where is it easy to be wowed away from the art by the window/ceiling lighting design. It will take many visits to appreciate it all. A must see!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dziran
50,Very cool!,"Visited the Broad on a whim to see the Infinity Room, Koons and Twombly. Very cool architecture, beautiful collection and interesting sculptures. Not sure it is worth waiting outside for hours, but certainly worth the stop if you can make it!",
30,Not worth a two hour wait,"Beautiful building. If you like weird contemporary art you will enjoy it.If you have a choice, go to the either of the Getty Museums.",
50,Exciting addition to the Los Angeles art scene,"What the Getty is for art the Broad is for modern art. Interesting, fascinating with a generous dose of whimsy is a way to describe the Broad. Do make reservations. They are easy to obtain on-line. Otherwise the waiting line is long, nearly a block long.",
50,Fabulous Museum,"The ""security"" guards are actually docents with backgrounds in the arts. They are very knowledgable and helpful and are eager to inform you about the art.They really enhanced the visit.",
50,Absolutely amazing,"Even for a museum attendee not necessarily into modern art, the Broads have created a fascinating museum experience. Containing the absolutely most iconic art work of the latter 20th century, the museum is a great addition to downtown LA.",
50,a top notch museum,"while tickets are difficult to obtain, they are free and if patient sign up now for a visit perhaps months from now. Not to be missed, a sensational gathering of fine art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jstntym
40,A Total Surprise!!,"First, I would say I am not a fan of modern art but I whole-heartedly enjoyed this museum. I purposely read nothing about the museum or the collection before going with friends. The building exterior is quite fantastic looking and is just south of Geary's Walt Disney Hall on Grand. You have to get a reserved ticket before coming. Tickets are free. Lines are still long and without tickets chances of getting in are slim and none. We stood in line briefly for our timed entrance at 1:30 p.m. The main gallery is on the 3rd floor. I found myself smiling a lot. Much of the work I don't understand but my eye gravitated to many, many things I enjoyed and marveled at. I loved discovering Mark Tansey. There is more gallery space on the 1st floor. It's about half the size of the main gallery. The collection is huge and you get a glimpse of the cold storage area on the second floor staircase landing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/marylouiseh2014
50,You'll Either Love it or Hate It,"The Broad is a contemporary mix of art that is playful, disturbing, shocking, comedic, bizarre and pop. The most mainstream art we saw was from Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rauschenberg and Jeff Koons.I knew there would be a line. I'd read a lot about the lines and the wait, so we arrived at 9:15 a.m. and were about 100 people back. Around 10 they were about to open the doors when a fire alarm sounded. We waited and waited, yet no trucks arrived for 40-45 minutes. Finally the trucks arrived, cleared the building and they began admitting visitors.I found myself strangely fascinated with David Wojnarowicz's work. But without a doubt, the strangest award goes to John Currin for Pearl and Patch.If you are into contemporary art you could easily spend 4-6 hours at The Broad. If you are not into contemporary art, you may not stick around long. If you are not sure whether or not you are into contemporary art, you will most definitely know the answer to that by the time you leave The Broad :)It took me a while to determine whether or not I enjoyed it … sort of the same way I feel after I see a Quentin Tarantino film. It was disturbing, at times funny, but it most definitely makes you think. I can now say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I would love to go back. I have not stopped thinking about the works of art we saw. That tells you something, right?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SandBAtlanta
50,The Broad Museum -Free,This museum is free but there is a wait on weekends. It is about an hour and so worth it. This Museum is bringing contemporary and modern art to many people who may not of gone if they had to pay $12.-$24 to see it. There many children exploring the rooms. The main space is on the third floor and is open and bright. the whole exhibit can be seen in about an hour. They own a lot of art that I assume will rotate into the exhibit so hopefully it will be changing on a regular basis. Plan to see the other nearby museums and sites if you are making a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/U4140QKmelissav
50,Incredible collection and it's free!,Places like the broad really make me feel a faith in humanity again. This massive collection is free to see and it's a good one! This is a prefect place for a date or just to go by yourself and experience it! Plus if you can get tickets the infinity room is a really brilliant application of light and interactivity. Loved the experience here and would recommend it to anyone interested in a good night out to a serious art buff.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/merandacarter
50,Wow!,"This is an awesome building housing an awesome collection of modern art. There are works by very famous and not so famous artists. The sense of a collection vault, the works that are not on display, is fabulous. Currently there is a long wait to get tickets. The good news is, tickets are for a time and date and they are free. A must see art museum.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigaloz2015
50,"An amazing experience, well worth the wait","The Broad is the new, high intensity, must see art museum in downtown LA. It forms a triumvirate with the MOCA opposite on South Grand Avenue and the Walt Disney Concert Centre next door.Essentially it’s the dynamic, highly personal and idiosyncratic collection of Mr. & Mrs. Broad (over 2,000 works), from over five decades of collecting. Housed in a high profile architectural statement, its form and detail, holding its own with the Gehry WD Centre next door. Unlike its contemporaries it’s free to enter, but is massively popular requiring queuing or if possible booking an advanced time slot on-line (currently about two months ahead).The museum houses a collection in depth, of contemporary art, themed by movement/ period over two floors. It’s well worth the visit because as well as many well-known names, there are many new artists with some challenging exhibits, which you are unlikely to see anywhere else.If you only have time to visit one art museum, go to MOCA you can pay and go in straight in rather than spending an hour or two queuing. Ideally, do both, but not on the same day, it’s too much to assimilate in a short period of time. The Broad has a very good website showing the work it houses.Enjoy.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J5042FYanthonyp

50,Excellent museum of contemporary art,"We got our free tickets for our Spring Break online a few months before. We took the metrolink train into Union Station, then 1 stop on the Red line subway and you are in the center of beautiful Grand Park. Head up the hill, and turn left. Broad is a few blocks away, right near Disney Hall. Reading TA we learned that you have to immediately go to reserve entrance tickets to the Infinity room, which was great. 45 seconds in there, and you can take photos. We all loved it. Start at the top floor (3) and work your way down. The circular clear elevator is really cool. Kids loved the huge chair piece and many others. 11 am was not crowded at all. A long line of people were waiting to get in w/o tickets (but staff said that most likely they would get in). We saw the restaurant outside and it looked great, but by 1 p.m. had a wait, so we headed for Clifton's Cafeteria, and then the Bradbury building and called it a day.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WalkingInLA

Congratulations L.A. for having created a fine contemporary art museum and filled it with tantalizing exhibits. Good mixture of pop art, some amusing, some thought provoking, some ridiculous. Enjoy the Broad's architecture - then go next door to the Disney Concert Hall and walk through the gardens behind it (picnic!) and the walkway over the roof - nice view to City Hall.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HermanTheGerman-inTX
40,Very Interesting Art Collection,"The Broad is quite an interesting collection. Definitely worth a visit to see the incredible amount of art that the Broad's have collected over I believe it was 30 years. Some of the art is modern. Some is contemporary. Some digital. Some controversial. All of which helps get you speaking about and thinking about various themes and context, which makes it worth the visit.The museum is two floors and there is a lot of see so I would give yourself about 2 hours to really enjoy seeing everything and reading about each artist. We were lucky enough to get into the waitlist line and make it in (waited about 30 mins). If you can get a timed reservation, Im sure that would make like much easier, but they seem to be sold out weeks in advanced these days, so just try to go and wait in line.We'll go back again and see some new exhibit changes so Ill be watching the calendar for openings!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bobbydigital04
30,Nice space. Not my idea of great art.,"Beautiful building. Less space for art than you'd think given the size of the building. But my taste in art is way different from Mr. Broad's. He favors contemporary and pop art, which I find amusing, and perhaps decorative, but not worthy of building an entire collection around or filling an entire museum with. Also, excellent people watching, since the museum has certainly proven popular with the trendy 20 and 30 somethings and young foreign tourists.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/smgradman
50,Fabulous modern art collection,Get a timed ticket... this place is popular.What a collection! Fabulous architecture... gotta believe the designer is devoted to Gaudi.The docents are very competent to elaborate on the art. They are much more than security people.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/seattlesez
50,Spring break visit,Took my kids to the Broad this week. I highly recommend this to everyone visiting or living in LA.Get tickets as soon as possible. My kids 12 and 15 loved every minute of this experience.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sjk7470
40,Good for an hour,"The good thing about my visit was that I was with a group and did not have to wait in line.Basically it is a one floor museum (third floor). There are a few rooms on the first floor, but the major exhibit is o the third floor.The highlights of the collection on the third floor, for me, are Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shardsman
50,Beautiful,Beautiful on the outside and excellent presentation on the inside. We enjoyed every inch of the museum.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rachelbyrge
50,First Class Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art,"Yes, the work displaced is sometimes troubling and controversial, but it encompasses the latter part of the 20th Century and beginning of the 21st Century and makes us face the issues of just a few years ago and the issues that we are struggling with today. You will find the crowd here is very young and they relate to the art more than older folks. Art is in the eyes of the beholder and The Broad gives a keen perspective on our times and the society we live in. This is art that doesn't necessary make you feel good (there are some of those pieces here), but art that makes you think and examine yourself.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
50,Make sure you pre-arrange tickets!,"The Broad was one of the highlights of our trip. Modern art at it's best with knowledgeable, friendly staff, all encased in a stunning building. You can pre-book tickets (which we didn't know at the time) and I suggest you do, as the line up can sometimes be up to 3 hours long, as it was the day we decided to go. We went across the street to the MOCA Gallery and then found a shorter line for the Broad a couple of hours later. Highly recommended and most definitely worth the wait!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tery642
40,Decent place to visit...if you had tickets,"If you like some contemporary artwork, the Broad is the hip place to be. Almost as the MOCA at the Geffen I saw years ago showing street art. This museum has a mix that will bring hipsters and hypebeast kids here, and even wait in the line (don't chance it). We had tickets booked months in advance, and even had extra to give one away.However, we couldn't wait 3 hours for the Japanese artists exhibit but I'm sure I didn't miss anything. The halls were cool though, plenty of pics to take. I hope they can bring more street artists the next time I come.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/got-rice
40,"Modern Art with some ""questionable"" art","Modern Art, as a genre, can certainly encompass questionable art or pieces accepted just because an artist has a good agent, anyway, this museum houses only Modern art with many pieces displaying dubious artistic talent... Yes, there were some wonderful, dynamic pieces but I found that a majority of the art here would have sent most art instructors screaming. I mean, really, a gold plated latrine? So, if I gold plate a toothbrush will that make me an artist? There was a large room filled with framed alphabet letters, big splatter painted canvases, a dead goat in formaldehyde that is supposed to represent life death science and religion... Uh huh. OK whatever. Even the giant table that is in everyone's' photos - just looks like someone stole a prop from ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids""...That said, the museum is free so, why not check it out? I had reserved a free entrance over a month earlier so that I could be sure to see the inaugural installation: Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room which was really cool. Once you enter you had to run over to the entrance and reserve an entry ticket because it's one person at a time for 45 seconds. We got there early enough that we got out and got tickets again for 30 minutes later.As far as entrance to The Broad - If you don't get entrance tickets ahead of time online you can still go because there is a waiting line for people without advance tickets and they are constantly letting people in from that line. 15 minutes before The Broad opened, that line was already half a block long so get there early.The underground parking structure advertises $20 for parking, or $12 with a validation from The Broad - but beware - in the fine print, that is for 3 hours only. After that it goes back up to $20. So if you dawdle or stop to each lunch, calculate that you just added $8 to your bill. There was cheaper parking diagonally across the street which I didn't notice until after we parked.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LA_dweller
50,I was visiting with my brother and our friend from South Carolina and we were just taking her around LA.,"The Broad was great. If you love art, it has some amazing things to see. It has an enormous table and chairs you can walk under and you still can't even touche the top of the table with your head and I am 5'9"". Great exhibits like the Infinity room and my favorite was all the different videos from different artist in like mini theater rooms. 3 levels.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josueg888
50,A must see if you like contemporary art,"Yes, tickets are a problem. We tried a couple months in advance for any day during our visit and struck out. However, I got a mailing that additional tickets had just become available and we were able to get them on a day we could visit. I would not try to go without tickets, as you could be in line for hours.This is a private collection so there are rooms dedicated to one artist. If you like what the Broad's have collected, you will love the museum. The architecture is also interesting. It is certainly worth a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lblg
50,Worth a visit,"This was on my must-do list for my most recent trip to LA, after watching its construction over most of 2015. We tried to book, but tickets were reserved up until May so we chanced it after work one Tuesday. We arrived at 5:45pm and got in with 6pm tickets. I'm not a huge art lover, however after a recent visit to NGV in Melbourne to see a Warhol exhibition, I was convinced that I wanted to go yo the Broad. I loved it. It's a great space and had a fantastic collection on display. The main disappointment was that the tickets to the LED light display were all distributed, so I didn't get to see this. Otherwise, I'd recommend this to anyone of any age...fantastic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/em_be53
50,Our finest contemporary art museum visit.,"We had to wait about 25 minutes in the late afternoon on a weekday to get in, but wow, it was worth it. We were so enthralled that we didn't take pictures until the end. Saw works by: Jeff Koons, Andy Warhol, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Keith Haring, Takashi Murakami, and discovered John Currin (new to us!) and it was FREE! Get there soon before the price goes up to $12, but it will be well worth that cost, too.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/learnincurv
50,LOVED The Broad,"Even though we waited an hour and 15 minutes to get in, we had an awesome visit to The Broad. We got in line at 10:30 am on a Tuesday, and we got in at 11:45. I wasn'tn in a great mood after waiting, but with a few minutes of wandering the galleries, I felt better. They have an amazing collection of modern art, and I loved that it wasn't too big- it felt manageable to see it all in a couple of hours. It was totally worth the wait (though of course it would have been better to get tickets in advance!) even the elevator ride was an experience. It's cylindrical and all glass. Make sure you wander under the giant dining room table - so cool!And the Mirrored Infinity Room is on view through Sep 2016. Make sure you see it! As soon as you enter the museum, go to the (short!) kiosk line to put in your cell number. They will text you when it's your turn to go into the Infinity Room.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abh345678
50,Must see if you are in Downtown Los Angeles,"We got our 6 tickets for March 23 two months in advance. You may still be able to get in by getting in line before they open. Some people started lining up by 8 am even if they open at 11am. If you have a ticket, you may start lining up 30 minutes before your admission time on the side of the left side of the entrance. It is good to get there early and line up to get to Infinity Room where each person gets to spend 45 seconds to enjoy the art inside the room alone--which we didn't get to do because the line was too long and we came in at 3pm. The Infinity room is located on the left side of the escalator. The escalator will take you to the third floor where the main exhibits are. The museum was very modern and spacious. Although I prefer to have less people when I am taking pictures, there were times when a section was empty. There are works of art on the first and third floor. The restroom and their storage is on the second floor. I had a backpack and although I could have carried it with me, I decided to leave it and I was given a ticket in exchange. It took us 2 hours to complete the museum without the infinity room. The gift shop is located next to it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/magviajemas
50,A great museum of modern art,"The Broad Museum is a wonderful museum of modern art if you like modern art. I don't, but I still enjoy the museum. When you arrive, go directly to the sign up line for the Infinity Room. It is a very special exhibit where you get to spend 45 seconds alone in a room of mirror and lights that give you the sensation of being in infinity. Take your camera. Makes a great photo. You will then be texted with the time you should return to see the exhibit. You get a second text 10 minutes before your assigned time. There are no docent tours of the Broad. But do ask anyone dressed in black wearing a red tag about any artwork that interests you. They are not just guards, they are knowledgeable artists and art students eager to share their experience. Parking at the Broad is validated and costs $8, but is limited to 3 hours. If you exceed that time, you will be paying $22.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/850annettem
50,Are you in a bad mood? Go to the Broad!,"I love modern art and the Broad has a good collection. You can take great pictures. The building is amazing. You just need 2 hours, and then visit the Disney concert hall gardens.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidpC6878JH
50,Contemporary with an edge,"This is a beautiful museum, staffs are friendly, and the location is centralized with easy access to public transportation. Admission is free only online, come early and reserve time spot to see infinity mirror. There are staff all over to make sure you don't touch or get too close to the art. Do not park near the museum walk few blocks for cheaper parking!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sugaylange
50,So much good stuff! Be prepared to feel!,"This place is free and it's incredibly cool, so the line outside is a bit unsettling, but I waited in it because I knew it would be worth it. You can spend most of your day just meandering and taking it all in. There will be art that will inspire you, move you, provoke you, and some that will make you feel like a kid again. Sure, there are the oversized objects you've probably seen in people's Facebook photos ~ and there's a reason for that, they make great photos! There are also rooms that stir your emotions and break your heart. I think of the shadow art on a curved wall that traces the injustices inflicted on African Americans over centuries. But after being gutted by that you can enter a darkened room filled with screens of musicians in different locations but playing the same song that will soothe you into knowing everything is going to be alright.This place is awesome.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WinnerLauren
10,Life is too short for the Broad,No museum is worth waiting 2.5 hours to get in and definitely not this one! This popular sight in no way lives up to the hype and the administration of hundreds of people queueing is ridiculous. Go spend your time somewhere else...,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/993madsh
30,Architecture Supersedes Art,"It's interesting architecturally, but the art collection could be more interesting/diverse, the process to visit could be less involved, and the overall experience far better. I made a reservation two months in advance and had to stand in line to enter and couldn't step in the Infinity Mirrored room for 60 seconds. This was unacceptable to me, since I wasn't given any other option. I'd be happy to pay an entry fee if it means having more order around the place, since it felt more like a busy market when I went than a museum for art appreciation and quiet contemplation. Did I mention that I had to stand in line for nearly 30 minutes despite having reserved my ticket two months in advance?As an art lover, of course I appreciated many of the works on display. It's just that I don't believe the current overall TripAdvisor rating of The Broad is representative of what's actually there.Los Angeles has some fine museums. The Broad is not one of them. At least not yet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/inavigator
50,Just go,"We had wanted to visit ever since it opened but tix were a little hard to score on the weekend. So when we found out that a new set had been released, we jumped on the opportunity. So, first recommendation: plan in advance. Yes, you can stand in line for hours for the opportunity to visit but really...hours in line? If you're up for that, fine. But, c'mon. The building's exterior is fascinating, a visual counterpoint to the Disney hall across the street. As for the collection, it is overwhelming what Mr. and Mrs. Broad have amassed. Not one or two Warhols but an entire room. Not one or two Lichtensteins but an entire room and including 2 rare sculptures. Not one or 2 Jeff Koons but ... well, you get the idea. With the MOCA across the street (and the Geffen extension a mile away) this is now a major gallery destination. My last recommendation: The Broad is attracting hordes of people, especially young people, on the weekends. If you have the option, visit during the week. If you must visit on the weekend, don't hesitate. Just go. Oh, and the gift shops here, at the Disney and at MOCA are wonderful!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/davidgZ6747AB
50,Get Free Tickets in Advance,"As one of the newest additions to the LA museum scene it is definitely worth the effort to get tickets. The Broad (pronounced Brode) is a philanthropist's collection, and obviously their taste in contemporary art. We had seen some of it several years ago when there was a loan to LACMA, but there are many new pieces as well. Lots of big names, Koons, Rothko, Walker, to enjoy. Parking is $22.00, which sounds bad, but it isn't for LA. Some will really like the building's architecture... we thought it was incredible.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoneAgain02
50,Fantastical,The Broad is a very new contemporary museum located near the Disney Concert Hall. Getting there is easy and parking convenient to site. The architecture is very carefully thought out and enhances the viewing experience. Well worth the price-FREE.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BoboTravlr
50,Can't Wait to Return,"Although not usually huge fans of contemporary art, this collection and its presentation impressed us beyond what we thought possible. The information available to explain the often otherwise undecipherable pieces was invaluable and made the history and concepts of the art accessible. The two rooms with films we watched/listened to created unexpectedly emotional experiences. Outstanding",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/aquaBend
30,different,"reservations are necessary but that does not mean that there will be no lines, the lines may be because it just recently opened and there was a greater demand .it was not worth the wait , maybe it is my taste but i felt that The Broard was put together by someone who has too much money and wants to indoctrinate others in what they THINK art should be.in reality i was not impressed and was in fact bored at the Broadimagine a room with 4 walls with a few letters on each wall or a balloon sculpture or a photo of cemetery with naked people looking at a photo of the depository of a grave. i found nothing that was of interest that i can remember other than the curiosity of what is next.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/183matthewl
50,Blown Away,"This is by far my favorite museum to date. I traveled from Texas and did my research beforehand to maximize my visit. My original plan was to get there on a Tuesday around 10:30 a.m. (half an hour before the museum opened) to get in the standby line. I was prepared to wait as long as necessary to get in. On a whim, around 9 that morning, I decided to try one last time to reserve tickets online. By pure luck I was able to secure one ticket for the noon time slot! I got there around 11:50 and waited in a short line while they scanned tickets. As advised on here, once inside the museum I immediately looked for the Infinity Room kiosk and was able to sign up for my :45 second time slot. I ended up waiting 4.5 hours which was 100% worth it to me!! It was just unreal. As for the museum itself, WOW is all I can say. What a gift from Eli and Edythe Broad to provide FREE art to the public right in downtown LA. They had such vision to collect contemporary art for 50 years that is so relevant in today's society. Can't wait to come back! Main tip: Come as early as possible if you want a chance to get into the Infinity Room!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/carlyqpsu
20,Less would be more...,"No visit to any museum is a waste of time, but a visit to The Broad comes close. I don't regret waiting on line for more than an hour and a half to get in on a Sunday morning, because the weather was balmy, the conversations were pleasant, the museum personnel were helpful and unobtrusive, and the price is right. Given the hype, had I not seen the museum, I would have thought I'd really missed out on something exciting. But waiting on line proved to be a bit better than the museum itself. The Broad is the museum equivalent of Disneyland--all pre-imagined and PG. There's not a single artwork or artist that would make The Broad a must-see. The collection is a cookie-cutter checklist of all the right stuff, from the con artistry of Jeff Koons to the Jemimah-one-note drivel of Kara Walker. The lobby is a cross between the TWA terminal at Kennedy Airport and a Fred Flintstone cave house. Indeed, The Broad is the museum equivalent of any modern airport anywhere--sterile and placeless. There are a few predictable pieces by L.A. artists Ed Ruscha and John Baldessari, but much better works by them are on view at LACMA and any number of other museums. The Cy Twombley alcove might have offered a more reflective opportunity, but the works seem cramped and the weak wall cards seem to have been written by someone looking up the artist on the internet. Even on a sunny day, the top floor main gallery didn't seem bright and shiny. It felt sterile and more like being in a Target. The first floor galleries were not well laid out, and some great artworks failed to stand out. All in all, The Broad is a weaker version of Glenstone, the private, visit-by-reservation-only museum of modern and contemporary art in Maryland. There, too, the artworks represent all the usual suspects (and, like The Broad, hit rock-bottom with another set of Koons' Hoover vacuum cleaners), but the smaller number of pieces, the low-key obligatory tour guide, the quiet atmosphere, and the magnificent setting that blends art, architecture, and the landscape make it a more fulfilling and thought-provoking experience. Less would have been more at The Broad. Well and good to devote the large fourth floor space to pieces from the permanent collection. But the first floor galleries ought to be dedicated to a themed, short-term exhibition.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlanB801
50,Refuge if you can get in,"Plan way in advance. You need to reserve for tickets to get in the museum months ahead. If you are lucky to get in, plan to wait to get reservation to get into Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room. It will be 2 to 4 hours before you can get into the room. Fortunately you can come and go with your museum ticket. When you come back because you got a text your reservation is coming up, you wait again to get into the room. Like everything that's amazing you wait a long time for a brief moment - 45 sec to be exact.The rest of the museum is smartly planned so each art piece as well as grouped collections are features. The natural defused light is brilliant and makes the viewing an ideal experience.I love The Broad and grateful it's near work. If I plan it well it's my best lunch spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CINART
40,sold out but wait in line for tickets each day,Love modern & contemporary artLove this building and vibeTickets sold out for the next couple monthsNo ticket and arrived at 10:40am prior to 11:00 opening. Broad website indicates a 20-30 minute wait on weekdays. People in the line were relaxed and casual with a great mix of tourists and locals.There was a long line- about 1 block and I was in at 12:15pm (an extra 45 minutes or so)Mirror exhibit had a 4 hour wait!-- skipping that!Staff inside and outdoors are relaxed and pleasantLove modern artLove this building,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,A treat,I visited this museum with a senior group so we were able to bypass the lines. The audio guide on the Broad app is worth downloading although not all works are described. The collection is both whimsical and perplexing but the architecture is most interesting. Be sure to reserve tickets in advance. We were lucky to see a wonderful exhibition.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jfd
50,Art Museum visit during lunch time was energizing.,Great opportunity to see the newly opened exhibit for free. Register online for reserve time. Parking was convenient and reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/butchrey
40,What a gem,"We had a delightful visit at this museum. The visit is totally free except you need to reserve early a few months to get in, but you can also wait in line on the outside each day and if not enough people, they'll let you in. The only thing is you have to pay for parking. $12 I believe. The building is gorgeous and displays are done nicely. Theres plenty of room to roam around. The bathrooms are really clean and new. Many volunteers to give you information. Take a couple of hours to visit.",
50,Spectacular Modern Contemporary Art collection,"Wow, what an awesome gallery. It's spacious and easy to navigate which allows the chosen selection of wonderful artwork to be displayed in the best possible way. The gallery is modern and innovative in its design. It's free to visit and definitely worth a visit for the avid art lover. Plenty of friendly staff to guide and advise visitors.",
50,A fabulous way to experience modern art,"An incredible collection of some of the best examples of late 20th Century art in a 21st Century building. While there is perhaps no signature piece that requires a separate gallery there are plenty of works that will be familiar. (Having said that, I note how contemporary the collection is including a photographic piece of the recent Ferguson, Missouri unrest.)Be sure to download ""The Broad"" app to your phone to take an audio tour of the building and collection. Spend some time experiencing the building from the outside and in. Note how every skylight window is ""north-facing"".Particular collection favorites are Koons ""Balloon Dog"" and Therrien's ""Under the Table"". And as soon as you enter the museum, line up to experience Kusama's ""Infinity Room"".Just don't overstay your parking.",
50,Unique Pieces,There are a lot of lots of modern art pieces. I pretty much have visited most of pieces in the museum. A lot of them are very interesting to look at. It's also completely free. Sometimes you can still get in even without getting a ticket.,
40,Major new modern art gallery downtown,"The Broad is in downtown LA near MOCA, shifting the cultural weight of LA back towards the downtown area a little. While LA's cultural attractions (Getty Centre, LACMA) can be a little spread out, it's nice to be able to walk easily between locations.Best feature - the museum is free. $0, 0 pounds and 0 yen. Inside they've got major artists like Jeff Koons' bubble-light objects that are actually, apparently, stainless steel (you won't believe it when you see them but it's true apparently). This is all top-class stuff!Only slight down side - if you don't pre-book tickets they make you wait 20 minutes for crowd control. So we waited for 20 minutes with 10 other people (only) outside a not *so* busy museum. Or maybe we're there for advertising or to create an impression of scarcity. Or maybe we were art also, who knows? Anyway, you should definitely go if you have even a slight liking for modern art. Just book a free timed ticket and enjoy. Closed Mondays.",
50,Simply Amazing - Quality and Quantity beautifully displayed,"Every aspect of the museum is thought out. You must visit and partake in every exhibit they have. You will have to wait about 3 months to get general admission tickets, however, there is an exhibit called the mirror room that can only be booked on the day of your visit. So when you book your tickets, get an early start, then once inside, sign up for the mirror room, if you finish early, leave, go have lunch, and return for your time slot in the mirror room. Have fun,",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NickellFamilyTravel
50,Wanted to experience The Infinity Room,We reserved our free tickets for Spring Break but on a spur moment decided to hang out in LA on January 1st. Waited in line for 45 minutes and got in around noonish and was told the Infinity Room was booked solid. Was advised that we have to be the first wave of guests that come through the door and sign up in order to experience it. The museum is on a smaller scale of exhibits compare to others in the area. So you sign up for the IR and complete your tour in less time than your appointment then what? You would think they find a way to accommodate all guests.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TTH888
50,Best Museum Experience Anywhere,"I didn't know much about the museum or the exhibits, but I got tickets several months ago and went with friends. The museum is free, and I advise trying for the first entry of the day. When we arrived, the line for those who did not have advanced reservations was around the block. We were admitted and went straight for the queue for the Infinity Mirrored Room (it's really well organized....you enter your cell phone number and then you get a text when it's your turn to get in the physical line to enter for your 45 second stay). The collection is really fun to view and there are lots of great photo ops. My favorite in the entire collection was the nine screen video piece by Ragnar Kjartansson located on the first floor. I almost missed it when I walked by and thought it was a storage room. We were there about an hour and a half, but I would leave about two hours. We also had lunch next door at Otium which is sort of considered the ""museum cafe"". I have been to art museums all over the world and when one couples the architecture of the building with the interest of the collection, it is now my favorite museum anywhere..",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/YorbaLindaStar
50,Beautiful!,I had a wonderful visit with my friend here. We came without reservations but only waited about 10 minutes before we were allowed in which was great! We spent about 2 or 3 hours here.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/npptravels
30,Nice but limited collection,"So it's free to enter The Broad, so be prepared for lines on the weekend. It took us about 90 minutes or so to gain entrance. Once inside you'll find a pretty building, though nothing that particularly stands out for museums that have a modern art spin. The collection takes about an hour to see, though if you want to enter the mirrors room, you'll need to arrive within the first hour of the day. That is a separate ticket and it goes fast. I liked the museum, but in comparison to others, I wouldn't describe it as a destination. Personally I wish it had more sculpture or installations, but there is a pretty nice diversity of artists. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely pay it a visit.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wgforester
50,Amazing Museum for Modern Art!,"This is probably the best contemporary art museum I've ever visited. Amazing architecture and beautiful works of art on display. I would have loved to see the Infinite Mirror exhibit, but it was completely booked and reservations were up by 11:00AM when I visited at about 3:00PM. There is so much to see and take in and the docents are very friendly and knowledgeable about the exhibits being showcased. General admission is free, but seeing as this is an essentially brand new blockbuster of a museum, be sure to book your ticket well in advance, as mine was booked since December at least and March was the next available time to go. Cannot recommend this place enough, definitely check it out when you have the time.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/colbys2014
50,Wonderfull,"The Broad gain my heart: beautiful building, really nice staff and a complete collection of my fav contemporany artists. It's a MUST see in LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fabiog482
50,Another must stop on your LA visit.,The Broad is an interesting building architecturally. The art collection is also very nice. You don't feel overwhelmed while there. Free Tickets are available on the Internet but not needed the last hour it is open.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrappe
50,Wow! Very impressive,"The Broad Museum features the private collection of contemporary art amassed by Eli and Edythe Broad. We were a bit skeptical after all the hype it's been receiving in the press since opening last fall. We were SO wrong! It's quite wonderful.The exterior of the building has a very interesting façade, but the interior is even more impressive. The top floor houses 35,000 square feet of gallery space with no columns, so it is divisible into many configurations. The ceiling includes more than 300 skylights that diffuse the SoCal sunlight perfectly.The current (opening) show is a survey of the collection. Particularly notable for me are the Ellsworth Kelly, the William Kentridge films, the Rauschenberg, a magnificent Chuck Close, Kara Walker (very unsettling), and large format photos by Struth.You go first to the third floor galleries by escalator (or elevator), then descend by stairs which afford glimpses of the extensive storage area on the second floor.Right now, the Broad is so popular that you must reserve your tickets (which are free) a couple of months in advance. Do it! You won't regret the effort.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Switzerdude
50,Stunning place!,"Get here by any means, but make reservations! This is the place to spend a great afternoon exploring the exhibits. Once you're able to get in, be sure to queue for the ""mirror"" room! They don't take reservations for it so the earlier in the day you come, the better your chances to go, 60 seconds at a time, in the mirror room. Many if not all the other exhibits were fantastic and a delight to the senses! Also be sure to pack some water, as you're going to stay a while.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AFonger
50,'Broaden' your Modern Art Experience,"The Broad museum opened last September 2015 and it has had over 300 000 people visit. Advanced Free Ticketing is recommended but not a necessity. I chose to go 45 min before opening and managed to get in no problem. (note that is closed on Mondays) While standing in line take advantage of the surrounding view of the spectacular Walt Disney Concert Hall. Or just bask in the gorgeous Southern California sun. The criss cross architecture of The Broad is interesting but it is really inside that it takes on a more sculptural form.Once inside head straight to the Infinity Room Line to reserve your place. This room is given dimension and sparkle through the use of mirrors and twinkle lights and it is mesmerizing. Note you only get 50 seconds in this space but once inside and your are enveloped, and after, it all seems worth it.There is lots of modern artworks to see, paintings by Andy Warhol, hyper realism by Chuck Close. The Broads love Jeff Koons kitsch, there's Julian Schnabel, Basquiat, Mark Bradford and my fav Takashi Murakami. And many more.The environment feels very inviting and interactive. Its so lovely to walk under a gigantic table and chairs. The museum ""guards' (the folks who stand watch over the art) are dressed in a casual friendly way making them very approachable. (this is imp to me because at most other museums in LA the guards are dressed in a very bland suit/uniform). Take your camera phones and snap away...I know you won't be able to resist this....",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edenrox10
50,Gorgeous space .. gorgeous art,"Get there! The building is so fine and amazing. Really a shell set over an architecturally perfect space. Roomy, breezy, bright, clear ... this is the way art should be seen. And the art! so much of the really good stuff of the past 100 years or so. And fun items like the crystal light room. The iPhone app is perfect. The variety of art is really a pleasure. No expense spared by the Broads and they did a damn fine job .. and continue to do so, adding a piece a week. Go.. no, really.. GO!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/R7244TJjiml
40,"Spectacular Building, OK Art Collection","We waited in line for almost two hours to get into the Broad. Pre-purchase tickets are sold out until mid-May. It seems as if they could give you a timed ticket when you walk up and that you come then return at the appointed but that isn't the case. The building is a work of art. The collection is very modern and has many well known items. The special exhibit can only accommodate one person at a time, and is a separate long line that we didn't wait in. The people that saw it said it was worth the wait. The Disney Concert Hall is next door and is well worth seeing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech1
50,"Spectacualar and Free, with the exception of natrue, when does this happen? I happens here.","A not to be missed museum. In a city of great art institutions, this one has quickly topped my list. The collection is manageable is size, and exactingly curated with clean and clear focus. It is a gift to the city, and something not to be missed on a trip to LA. Something we can be very proud of.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/618PeterH618
50,A Stunning Building And A Spectacular Collection,"We read articles in England about the new Broad art centre in LA and therefore were particularly keen to visit, not only for the Collection, but also to see the building. Having not booked in advance, we were expecting to wait in line for possibly an hour or more, but were pleased to find that arriving at about 3.30 pm, we were through in about five minutes. The building is stunning, not only the exterior, but the internal design flowing through and enabling the visitor to see the gallery stores and other sections. Needless to say, the artworks are fabulous, and it was interesting to note how many we had seen elsewhere whilst out on loan. A great experience and a must see",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsandrs
50,"Worth the Lines, Great Art Inside","This amazing structure was under tantalizingly close to completion the last time I was in LA, so it was a treat to finally see what the fuss is about. Amazing collections of fun, make you think, and often make you smile, modern art. It's free and every one should go. Fabulous building, inside and out.Take photos, because the book is 85 bucks, plus shipping, and there are only a very few postcards for sale.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shulaquilz
40,Excellent display of the material,"I'm not a huge fan of contemporary art, but the range of material displayed at the Broad certainly had something for everyone. If you don't like scribbled black stuff on a canvas, then you can enjoy the 85 foot Dragon Dance or one of the huge photographs of crowds or the 10 foot high dining room furniture. Personally, I thought almost half of the material was not to my taste, but I did enjoy the other half.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DavidG574
50,Drag the Kids along,"As parents we traded off the requisite Disneyland and Universal trips for a few trips to LA Museums and galleries... the kids actually really enjoyed the Broad, it was very accessible for young and older art lovers. And very free and affordable for a family.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mickraymond
50,Incredible and FREE,"One of things I most love about LA is the variety of museums to visit and the Broad is one of the best I've been so far. Despite how much you understand about art, just keep in mind that modern art is all about experience and in that sense this museum will not let you down. The place has been a big hit since its inauguration last year. As I write this review the tickets were sold out until may (3 months ahead). But don't lose hope, you can come early, around 10 am and line up for a line that moves up slowly but steady. Once inside, be a little patient and line up for yet another line for the installation ""Infinity Mirrored Room"" where you will be given a estimated time to enter the room. It's really interesting (and great for pictures).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShigueS
20,"Go for the Architecture, Not the Art","Have yet to get the point of much Modern Art, and there is lots to question in Broad's ""collection."" Like many modern collections, the building is a lot more interesting than the art. It's free, so there's nothing lost from popping in if you're in the area, but there's not much point unless you're a real fan. Exhibits are unimaginatively laid out, and little information supplied.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/eheyman
50,"A ""Must See"" on a any visit to LA!!","What a fabulous museum! The size was just right for a 2 hour visit with our teens. The layout was wonderful, and we loved exploring all of the art. There was such a nice variety of works, some more accessible than others, but all were interesting to see and learn about.We reserved our tickets a few months in advance, so we didn't have any wait to enter. There were staff members everywhere available to answer all of our questions.We definitely recommend this museum, and we can't believe that it is free!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Givati8

50,"Excellent, interesting art collection, in a unique building","Located next to the Disney Concert Hall and MOCA, The Broad, which opened recently in late 2015, contains the art collection of the Broad family, with various eclectic and creative artists located in different parts of the museum. Entry is through the ground floor and proceeds up sets of stairs to the main galleries, which comprises a single floor. Other galleries are located on the ground level, as well as the gift shop. The entire building facade is composed of a single diamond grate skin, which holds up the entire building, with no structural columns. Paid parking is available across the street, but public transportation is recommended.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tute66
40,Fun Museum,Overall I enjoyed this museum but if you are trying to see the Infinity Mirror Room you need to arrive a few hours before the museum opens. Otherwise you won't get a reservation for the exhibit. But the rest of the museum is free which was awesome!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Y9860FJjessicab
50,Extraordinary but make your reservations long in advance,"The new Broad Museum is stunning. The building is architecturally unique and beautiful, and the art is some of the most significant in modern day. It limits the amount of people inside so reservations should be made several months in advance otherwise, you can take your chance standing in line outside to get in. Midweek is the best bet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/habitatp2014
40,Eye candy,"Frank Gehry's Disney Concert Hall is a pretty challenging neighbor to keep up with but The Broad museum manages to pull off this great architectural challenge. The exterior is ""sexy ugly"" to use a dated term but it works. The white diagonal window patterned walls are a non structural sheath which folds over the top of the building to serve as the roof as well. The effect that these roof windows has on lighting up the interior collection is brilliant. Daylight without glare. The interior space on the entry level is dark and cavelike , hence referred to as the vault. The second floor where most of the collection is displayed is bright, bold and sharp. Although I didn't particularly care for the collection itself I loved being inside the space and being surrounded by the colorful art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/skatsof
50,Contemporary Art at its best,The new Broad museum is not only filled with wonderful contemporary artists work but the building itself is a work of art. Free to enter it has a wonderful app that can be used to book your tickets as well as become your tour guide.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TonyB873
50,Super Fun Museum,"Apart from the distinctive architecture, The Broad is a quirky museum that's a feast for the eyes! Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room was a highlight!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelling_Brogue
50,"Marvelous, Fresh, Uplifting","A key aspect of The Broad that works very well is that it's FREE, and thus it attracts a whole lot of people who would otherwise never visit a museum. And that's marvelous. As to the art, it's not all to my taste, but overall it is first rate. I especially enjoyed the video piece by Ragnar Kjartansson. Also, the building itself is a triumph of creative architecture. Fun and wonderful.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/abecedarius
50,Wonderful Morning,"The Broad expands the museum concept, a fascinating structure with wonderful light, varied and engaging works of art and excellent exhibits. The Infinity Room mesmerizes and if you can manage the time it is worth the wait.

The exhibits themselves were all interesting. Something to ake everyone smile.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/543SusanP
50,It's not a museum it's a gallery.,What a magnificent addition to the LA architecture and Art scene this gallery is.I won't call it a museum because that evokes dust and cobwebs. This is a beautiful vibrant bright cheerful gallery.I got a ticket for mid day on a Wed by going online several months ago. Unless you line up outside at 9 am that's what you have to do.The gallery is made up of three floors of huge rooms filled with equally huge magnificent art pieces.The collection on display is beautiful.I'll return often.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BodhranBeater
50,"Not too big, fun artwork, nice variety","We visited a couple of months after the museum opened. It is well worth the visit. I'm not a big museum person, but I do enjoy fun art work. Everything is very well displayed with lots of natural lighting. The art work is interesting and engaging. Get your tickets ahead of time so you won't miss out. You will get a timed entry ticket, but you can stay as long as you want. It's a fairly spacious building with plenty of room to see everything. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Justmycupoftea
50,Highly relevant,I was struck by how recent some of the acquisitions were. Not only did I see iconic pieces but very recent as well. Smaller than I anticipated but still well worth It.A great collection of contemporary art. A little disappointed that none of the Cindy Sherman was displayed. Next time I will check the exhibitions on the web site.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Arestrepo111
50,Modern Art,A new museum in Los Angeles that a friend recommended. The building itself is very interesting. You can make reservations online and it is free. There are special exhibits that require separate reservations. You can park in their garage but must pay $12 (recommended.) Art varies and it is mostly from the last 60 years. Definitely a must visit attraction in Los Angeles if you enjoy art. The Patina restaurant is next door.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JulioRB
50,Fun!,"This new museum is a fine, and not overwhelming collection. There is lots of space, and many interesting pieces. The museum does not take itself too seriously, and it is not stuffy in the least. There are numerous ""famous"" pieces, and many others equally worthwhile to see.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jebowley
50,Gem of a museum,"If you like modern art, you will love this small, well-organized museum in the heart of downtown LA next to Disney Hall. Even if you don't like modern art, the architecture of the building is innovative and the surroundings are worth exploring, too. Good for kids (but they're strict about not touching the art!), who get a kick out of the the giant furniture, the ballon dog, the soup cans...good food options nearby, too. Grand central market, down the hill, has something for everyone.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Redtree54
50,Very good,"Had to stay in line for 1 hour. Give you a tip: come here some 20 min before the opening and you will not have to stay in line like me. It is a free and gorgeous museum starting from the outstanding architecture of the building! You can try to book your line on this museum internet if it’s not too late. In this case I’ve noticed that the line was way shorter and it’s a separate line. Some paintings do not deserve to be displayed for public, but many do.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/k0za

40,Excellent Art Space,"Book you free entrance a couple of months before you want to go. Manageable size for about two hour visit. Love the building. I found the collection to be highly curated and although I love so much contemporary art, was not inspired by all the choices. Not a single Alex Katz, one of my favorites. Parking in the building is $12. Nearby CA plaza with validation is $8. On Sunday you may be lucky and get a free parking meter.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OBD2142
50,Fun time to be had,We visited the Broad over the holidays. What a great museum. Lots of cool artwork and the building is cool too. Looking out at the Disney concert hall from the gallery is surreal. Biggest drag is seeing people handle the artwork. It is nice that so much of the artwork is out in the open but I see why so many museums hold people back behind ropes and plastic bubbles. I think the poodle is one of my favorite pieces.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/823MarkF
50,Amazing art experience,Everything about this place is modern and just the arquitecture of the building is an experience in itself. The art is bold and you don't need to be an art expert to feel it,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/claudiast

50,Free collection of great contempoary art,"This addition to the museum district contains large contemporary works by major American artists. Even better, it is free. You can reserve an entry time on-line or take your chances in queue. The staff are young and friendly, and the collection is stunning. You might not like everything, but the large paintings by Cy Twombly are worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Z6458TNsusanm
40,My first visit at the Broad..,"This museum just opened last year and heard good reviews about it. So, my sisters and I paid a visit on a Sunday, which I think wasn't a good idea because we waited for almost 2 hours to get in......yes, that long. In all fairness, you could reserve a ticket but because they just opened less than a year ago, it's free and everyone in Los Angeles wants to go (duh?!), the tickets may be dated couple of months after you reserved it.The museum itself is not very big. I would say, the see the whole place would take you 1 hour and half the max. On the first floor, you will see the lobby and it is designed well as it shows the concept of the museum, which is contemporary-modern. There's also a gift shop in the lobby which sells interesting souvenirs and more. On the first floor, you will see inspiring paintings and photography art works. There are also continuous videos that are music inspired art works. Also, you will also find the infinity room, which I would say the most visited part of the museum. The Infinity room is excluded from the free entrance ticket, hence, you have to buy it. The tickets sold out early, so I believe those who has reserved tickets in the morning has a better chance of getting in.In the middle of the elevator, you will see an escalator that will take you to the second floor. There, you will see more paintings, photographs and sculptures. One of the most interesting part of the museum, is the Giant's room.There's a parking structure behind the museum, which has abundant parking spaces. Since the museum tour will only take you less than 2 hours, you could also see the museum of contemporary art, which is across the Broad and have your pictures taken in amazing Disney Concert hall, which is next to the Broad. You can also walk to the Grand Central Market (very recommendable for foodies out there!) or just stroll around downtown.I would highly recommend to reserve a ticket and wait a couple of months, rather than walking in. It's better to reserve in the morning so you have a better chance of getting a ticket for the Infinity room (which I failed to see because I just walked in). If reserving a ticket cannot be an option, I would avoid to visit the Broad on a weekend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/francesinred

I highly recommend you go first thing in the am (we went Sunday at 10am) as there is no crowd at that time. We finished around 1230 and went to lunch at the Grand Central Market which is in walking distance. My 13 year old loved it too and posted a lot on instagram, so you know it is great!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sondravaz
50,The newest of LA's many great museums,"This new private museum next to the Disney Music Hall in downtown LA is impressive inside and out. The building itself is a big piece of sculpture, with a kind of wire mesh effect covering the structure. Inside it's both grand and intimate--sometimes resembling the old TWA terminal at JFK and sometimes more like the new Whitney or the LACMA. The collection is mostly contemporary and very well curated. The visitors who were there the day we arrived were largely young and very hip. By the way, we didn't have advance tickets (they limit daily access to the museum) but we stood in line for 10 minutes and were ushered in.The Broad is a short walk to other downtown attractions like the Pueblo, Olivera Street, Union Station and the Museum of Contemporary Art. It was a great experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BlueNWashington
30,"Cool museum, put not worth waiting 2 hours in line for","So, me and a group of friends drove out to The Broad, specifically to see their infinity room that is on display. We had all heard great things about the room and all the photos of it look beautiful. We got there around 1 and the line was out the door, and around two separate corners of the building. We waiting 2 hours in line to only find out once inside that the infinity was booked for the rest of the day. We walked around the rest of the museum, which was still cool, but not worth waiting 2 hours in line to see. In my opinion they should have had a sign outside or someone come out to inform everyone that the room was all booked up, because I definitely wouldn't have stayed in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/volcomwr17
50,A must see,"Before visiting The Broad (with our group of 15) we went online to make our advance online reservations only to find out they were sold out until May. Since we still wanted to go, we waited in the onsite ticketing line. Onsite ticketing line is first come, first served and wait times range from 30 to 45 minutes on an average weekday, and 60 to 90 minutes on an average weekend. On holiday weekends, wait time in the onsite ticketing line can be up to two or three hours. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a line that stretched around the block, which meant we would have to wait inline for 2.5 hours.Once we got in I was surprised at how open and spacious the museum was. While walking through you greeted by an amazing collection of contemporary art. Keith Haring and Takashi Murakami were among my favorites.This place is a must see for art lovers. While I was disappointed by the fact that I didn't get to see the Infinity Room, I am sure I will be back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rafeek626
40,Interesting modern collection,"For me the Murakami collection is well worth the visit. There was no line when I went on a Thursday afternoon. But we could not get into the infinity room. There are interesting pieces from modern celebrity artists. like Warhol, Lichtenstein, Basquiat, Koons. Not really my thing but worth seeing nonetheless. Admission is free which is nice.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/USCKaboom

50,Amazing collection of contemporary art,"The new Broad museum is a real jewel! Even if it is free, tickets are required. While those available online are fully booked until April (and maybe later), only a part is booked online, so it is worthy to go and stay in the line (better during a working day). We were there on a Sunday and it took us around 40 minutes to enter. Once inside, the FIRST thing to do is to go to reserve the visit to Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room, which requires special reservation on-site, and after that you can enjoy the rest of the museum until the time to visit the Mirrored Room. The collections are excellent. If you love contemporary art, this is the place!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EmanuelaDC
50,Free admission,"The newest and most hippest museum in Los Angeles has arrived in Downtown LA. Since its opening there are constant lines to get into the museum. You can either make reservations months in advance or get in line before they open to get inside the museum. If you’re hoping to see the Infinity Room, there’s a line for that as well and it can take a couple of hours before actually enjoying the 45 seconds you have in there. The work here is very modern so no historic art. There are three levels, my favorite is the 3rd level. It has the coolest art pieces and it’s more spacious.There is no actual “store” for the museum, but on the opposite corner of the entrance there are some nick knacks for sale. There’s also a café right outside the “store” or walk a bit more to go to Grand Central Market.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kisssmee

Also a great opportunity to tie this visit with a visit to the ginormous array of crazy good new restaurant openings happening seemingly every hour in DTLA these days.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DBronchick

50,Must-see museum in L.A.!,"The Broad is absolutely, 150% worth a trip to DTLA -- the architecture both inside and out is mesmerizing, and the collection rivals MoMA and other top modern/contemporary museums, especially for American artists active in the 60s-70s-80s. Incredible to think that this is a private collection! Remember to organize your trip and get tickets in advance as you could wait for hours to get a day-of ticket.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AWills10026
50,Art and Architecture,"We visited The Broad on a weekday afternoon. Museum entry is free, however you must obtain a reservation online and there is approximately a three month long wait, (or take your chances and wait in a long line if you don't have a reservation.)The buildings architecture has been called ""the veil and the vault"", and combines public exhibition space and storage for their extensive Collection. The vault is surrounded on all sides by the veil, a honeycomb type structure which also creates filtered natural daylight. The buildings architecture creates optimum conditions for viewing the collection.The contemporary art includes works by Warhol, Basquiat, Kelley, Rauschenberg, Murakami, Ruscha, and Lichtenstein.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Violettini
40,Interesting,"We were lucky that a friend had paid for a group package a few weeks ago, allowing us to get in without queue-ing in line which was nice.The Broad, pronounced B-road, is a pretty unique museum. The museum set up is open but there's a linear flow that gives the museum a sense of order. It is suggested that you experience the museum from top down.Upon entry, you're greeted with a dimly lit open area with a line of people queueing for the light show and a small gift shop and a gigantic curvy white wall. This a little resemblance to The Guggenheim in NYC.The 'real' museum is an escalator ride up 3 stories. Once you're at the top, you're greeted with more endless white walls with paintings strategically littered on the them.There are plenty of provocative art and sculpture and others that leaving you scratching your head. With 30,000 sq feet of space, you can easily get lost for an hour or two just on the top floor perusing all it has to offer.The 2nd floor gives you a glimpse of where these artworks and sculptures are meticulously cared for.Remember the entry way, well, there's actually another gallery, albeit smaller than the 3rd floor one but with a very interesting exhibit that includes an hour loop of musicans singing and playing the same song from different rooms in a house. It's quite the experience.Like all new things, the interest for The Broad is unimaginably high so expect to wait if you want to come check it out. But if you have a group of friends, it is definitely worth it to get a group package to skip the queue and seeing what everyone is talking about.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/crabwalk_koala
50,Worth the Wait!,"The museum is still very new and extremely popular. Be advised to arrive at least 1-2 hours before opening if you do not have reservations. We did not have a reservation and arrived about one and a half hours before opening time. There were already about 100 people in front of us. The line moved fast once the museum opened. To view the famous Infinity Room you must sign in on the iPad on the first floor, then you are assigned a number and are alerted via text when to come down. It took around 4 hours until we were able to view the room, however you are able to leave the museum and re-enter easily with your original ticket. It was worth the wait, and the art inside the museum is worth viewing. Admission is free to the public.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mrdortiz
50,A Blockbuster for Art,"There has been a lot of buzz surrounding the opening of this new contemporary art museum. There are a lot of haters who love to critique this collection as much as they like to critique the entirety of the LA Art Scene. Well I'd like to invite all these NY Trolls to go back to their cave, because this museum is wonderful with an exciting potential to continue to develop its collection and programs.The base of the collection includes sublime works by Lichtenstein, Koons, and Murakami. I was personally delighted by the impressive works by the late Ellsworth Kelly, the amazing Kara Walker, and of course Cindy Sherman. It's is a who's who of pop- contemporary art and if you are in LA you should put this museum on your to do list. When you see ""the greats"" it can naturally feel a little showy...but the Broad embraces this in a sublime way. After all this is LA - we do put on a good show!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LAartadvisor
40,Beautiful,"You must get your tickets in advance online. The day of lines are very long, and not often a guarantee to get in. Advance tix get booked months in advance to you need to plan!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tikidream
50,A great collection....... right in city central!,Great modern art! The fact that this is free and open to the public is amazing and a wonderful plus for LA!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Leisure50
50,Must see free museum!,This museum was absolutely amazing! They have many different styles of art and exhibits that are all free to the public. Definitely buy tickets in advance or you will have to wait in a long line. Plan for at least two hours so you can see everything!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Monicaicequeen
50,A great way to spend the day,"Had breakfast at the Grand Market and then walked to The Broad. What a wonderful place to see some iconic art.Lots of modern art. Be sure to download the app to get the full experience.Admission is free, but tickets are timed. Be sure to book a few days ahead to get the time you want.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BuckCRNA
40,A lot depends on getting advanced timed tickets--and they just aren't available,"The Broad, is, let's face it, a vanity project. Fortunately Broad has the money and a strong enough sense of self to assemble a pretty good collection. And finance fine architecture to house it. Although he is clearly not spending money, time or thought on the labels that purport to describe his art.The collection is clearly the product of an individual's taste. It isn't encyclopedic or even all that inclusive in terms of contemporary art. For me it has WAY too much Jeff Koons. It does, however, include some exceptional pieces, and some worthy surveys of individual artists.But the museum is also a product of its marketing--and to some degree an incentive for marketing. The museum is free to visit but you need a ticket to enter. As of January 2016 entrance tickets were booked up through March or into April. And Yayoi Kusama's Inifinity Mirrored Room is even harder to get into. We couldn't stay and stand in line on the off chance there would be space.We fortunately had to wait only about 25 minutes and got in standing on line. But I don't like standing on line and I think contriving to have a line outside the door pretty much all day long is about advertising the name ""Broad"" more than the art inside. I don't like the idea that Broad is selling his museum by getting people to stand in line--as though good art must have a line to get in or deluding people into thinking that if there is a line, whatever it is must be good.The collection is pretty good though. The installation is thoughtful even though the labels are perfectly horrible. (Yes, I believe a posted on the SD Museum of Contemporary Art a few days ago with the same complaint.) The language is gobbledegook, arcane artspeak that uses words in a way that no dictionary would recognize. Labels don't elucidate the objects they are attached to; instead they natter on with vague and indecipherable chatter about the artist, the movement or art ideas in general.For some reason titles not in English are not translated. I find this just arrogant. Titles are important and I don't think it reasonable to expect museum goers in the US to be able to read German. And given the number of Asian visitors (and the Asian populations in LA) translating labels into Japanese and Korean might have been a good idea. Spanish too. Perhaps they did on the app (I had left my phone behind and so did not download the app or use it) but there was not printed signage in anything other than English. Except for the German titles.The Broad is an excellent addition to the LA contemporary art scene--and the national and international one. But Eli B. needs to understand more fully that a museum is not a private gallery. It is a public space and an educational endeavor.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lnwyd
40,Great collection of contemporary art,"Love this collection of contemporary art. I reserved tickets online and parked underneath the Walt Disney Concert Hall (right across the street) since I had tickets for a performance that evening. You can't reserve tickets online for the Infinity Room, you can only get those when you enter and by that time (mid afternoon), it was a 4 hour wait. Probably best to get there right in the morning if you want to get inside the Room within a reasonable timeframe. Otherwise, I loved getting close to Jeff Koons's beautiful work!On the weekends, food trucks park in front so you can grab food which is great.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thiscozyskull
50,Excellent Contemporary Exhibits,This museum was easy to walk through. The exhibits were unique to say the least and the imagination of people is amazingI went with my daughter and spend time walking through the museum. We practically saw everything as it was nicely spaced-out.I will definitely return and recommend this place to any Angeleo and out of towners. I believe they change the exhibits quarterly.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GeorgeLinCPA
50,Excellent. Free.,Beautiful Meuseum. Did it with 3 kids ages 20 to 24. Fascinating stuff and exhibits. You can do it in an hour or two. Long lines about 20 min,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/badbaruch57
50,A must see while in LA,"I was looking forward to the opening. Got the tickets online and it was a no hustle experience to get in. My only wish is that there is an option to make a reservation for the special exhibits. I arrived at 12pm and the Mirror room was all booked. It was very disappointing. I had a great time, enjoyed the experience. Would highly recommend the video installation on the main floor- it is mesmerizing! There was nothing available to sit down and grab a bite, so we had to leave and come back. Hopefully this will be fixed soon (if not already). The lines for the people that showed up without reservation were long. I can not wait to go back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freemaee
50,Exceptional!!!,"Great experience, really enjoyed the mirrored infinity room as wall as all the other art. The building is very well designed to showcase the collection. Just very impressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMRNJ
50,The Infinity Mirrored Room Levels Up the Experience,"If I didn't get to experience the Infinity Mirrored room, my thoughts on The Broad may well be different.Since we had advanced timed tickets for the museum opening, we were able to see the Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room within 20 minutes of opening. You are allowed 45 seconds to experience the room which is a real treat. After that, you leave the room with a new sense of wonderment and everything is just simply exciting.The lower level has an entire room of Takashi Murakami and there was also a dark room with different projectors of music being played at different rooms in a house which was also fun. Upstairs on the third level, one can enjoy some works by Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol etc. I spied Damien Hirst' sheep in formaldehyde there as well. ;-(The museum is free so there's really no excuse not to visit, but you may want to get those advanced time tickets to be able to see the Yayoi Kusama as the wait can be pretty long.By the way, if you have young kids with you, you may want to supervise them as there is no interaction and you can't touch or go a foot or so near the various artworks.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nadarien
40,An interesting collection,"The Broad is the latest addition to the Grand Avenue art venue in Los Angeles. It is a very stark neighbor to the Disney. We were not disappointed by the collection, but there were no real surprises either.Perhaps because it was January 2nd, or perhaps it was because it is so new, or perhaps it was because there was no entry fee, but there were a very, very, very long line. We tried something that we had found to work at other museums. There is a separate entrance for the museum store and so we entered there, asked if we made a purchase could we then enter the museum proper and found that the Board has such a policy. So, we made a purchase of a new piece and were provided with 6 entry tickets. So, it worked on this date, but with no entry fee if the line is short it is a choice to make.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PeterandJinx
40,Awesome!,Free admission after advanced reservation. Infinity room was well worth waiting 3-4 hours for a 45 sec experience since we had to take a chance that someone won't show up.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ninangku
30,An Art Market Triumph,"In recent years, the traditional arbiters of taste—curators, critics, art historians—have ceded much of their former influence to big-spending collectors. Arguably the most powerful collector on Los Angeles, Eli Broad has built a collection that is a triumph of market savvy. His collection presents the past sixty years of (mostly) American art history as compendium of best-sellers. The collection is heavy on market darlings like Warhol, Koons and Damien Hirst. In a token bow to political correctness, there is a smattering of works by women and people of color. But here too the emphasis is on the theatrical; e.g., the bold sloganeering of Barbara Kruger. To be sure, any inaugural installation is prone to taking a greatest-hits approach. It remains to be seen whether the Broad will later on probe the more complicated and conflicted byways of recent art history.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Widget2016
50,"Worth visit, plan it properly...","This new museum comprise of two different attractions: the first one is a big collection of contemporary art. The second one is kind of sensual experience, taking place in a room inside the building and lasting less than a minute long.If it doesn't sound as I know what it is exactly it is true, and it is because in both times we tried going there we couldn't make it: the first time we arrived at 2pm and were told that the rest of the day is booked out. So another day we arrived there shortly after opening (they open at 10am, closed Monday), only to discover a huge line of people stretching around the building...You may book in advance but right now booking is filled up till March! So, in order to be able to make both attractions at the same day, you probably need to come mid week, off season / holiday (we were during the Christmas / New year...) or come there well before opening...One more thing about the line: the whole waiting take place outside the building, in the open! So if it's raining or very cold, might be an unpleasant experience, on the other side likely less of a line... They allow people in in groups od 25-40 every 20-30 minutes, so the line moves in batches.Never the less, the exhibition of contemporary art works are by itself worth seeing and visiting, at least if you are only an art fan and not art expert (I read some other reviews playing down the exhibition, which to my judgment were totally wrong). We found the collection to be very interesting, unique and big...But to our understanding, the second attraction is magnificent so you want to try and do both...Entrance is freeEnjoy",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gilan7
40,I think it would have been great - make reservations or get there early.,"we arrived at 11:20, the doors open at 11...we did not have reserved tickets and the wait was already 3.5 hours! I have high hopes for when I do get in. Everyone seemed happy when they left.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TaniaCarriere
50,Beautiful new museum with works by big name artists,"Stunning venue. Everywhere you turn..works by major artist such as Ruscha, Basquiat, Koons. A bit crowded because it opened recently. Reserved a ticket two months in advance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Traveling_Lady_456
50,Great museum - and free,If you are interested in modern art you should not miss the Broad. Eli Broad and his wife have amassed a great collection of modern art. The works are shown in the just completed museum next to Disney Hall. There is a great view from the window(see below). I thought the museum was very well laid out. You can hear about the works on your phone. They are really good examples of each artist's work.Entrance is free but you have to make a reservation although there is a standby line. You can park under the building for $10. If you really love modern art and have the stamina you can visit MOCA across the street.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/morrisk446
50,Hottest Ticket in Town for a Reason,"The Broad Museum just opened in September and is one of the hottest tickets in Los Angeles. If you have a chance, and have any interest in contemporary American art, you will definitely want to see it.Admission to the Broad is free, and you can get timed tickets on line. It is, however, extremely popular at present and as of November 1 the on-line tickets were sold out through 2015. You can also get tickets there, however, although you may have to stand in line. If you are there around a holiday or busy weekend, you might not get in at all, but I was able to walk in without any wait on a Tuesday afternoon in early December.The Broad itself is architecturally interesting, with a distinctive façade next to the equally interesting Frank Gehry-designed symphony hall and across from MOCA. The inside is also interesting, with curved, almost organic seeming walls. The main galleries are on the 1st and 3rd floors, but there is also a great deal of art in storage you can glimpse through windows along the staircases.The art itself is a donation of a generous couple (Eli and Edythe Broad) who also funded the museum construction. It is heavily, and possibly exclusively, focused on American contemporary art after around 1945. The galleries are more or less arranged by artists or pairs of artists. One, for example, has the complementary art of Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns. Another is devoted to Roy Lichtenstein, and another to Andy Warhol. The remainder is a veritable who’s who of contemporary art (John Currin, Takashi Murakame, Keith Haring, Jean Michael Basquiat, Jeff Koons, Robert Rauschenberg, Damian Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly, etc.). The descriptive materials in each gallery about the artists are helpful.If you like contemporary art, this collection will be a delight to you. Some, however, will ask the reasonable question whether some, or even all of this, is actually art. If you fall into this group, you will likely have fun anyway if for no other reason that to amuse yourself with what others consider art or just for the experience of people watching.The museum has wi-fi and a helpful app, so you might want to bring along earbuds or headphones if you have a question about a particular piece. The app also has various tours, including an architecture tour, if you are interested and even a family audio tour narrated by Roots and Star Trek TNG star LeVar Burton.The galleries are large, well-lit, and do a very good job of displaying the art. Although the museum was relatively busy, I did not feel at all crowded and actually found myself alone at times in some of the galleries.They don’t limit photography, and certain pieces, like an oversized dining room set (Robert Therrien’s “Under the Table”), were popular sites for couples to have pictures taken of themselves visiting. They don’t allow selfie sticks, which is great if you’ve ever been in a popular museum that doesn’t have such a ban. Everyone is in a good mood, so just find someone to take the picture for you.One of the more amazing pieces is the Yayoi Kusama infinity room. It only holds about 4 people and is in extremely high demand. The wait when I was there was 2 hours and 45 minutes. Fortunately, I had seen it elsewhere, but if you arrive when the line is a bit shorter or if you are able to get one of the timed tickets it really is amazing. The room is full of lights and mirrors so that when the door is closed you basically feel like you are in the middle of space that goes on forever. Is it art? You decide, but it is really cool by any standard. They do have timed tickets separately for this exhibit and I would highly recommend getting one.It is obvious that the collection will rotate and there are windows into the extensive storage space on the second floor, suggesting that they are trying to cultivate return patrons who will come back to see the art as it comes onto display.The Broad is a very welcome addition to downtown Los Angeles.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ElaineAndGreg
50,A must see in LA,"If you like modern art and are in LA, you need to go to The Broad. Free admission but need to get your tickets on line early. You can get tickets at the door but you wait in line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Estjwm
50,"Stupendous, a Must See in our City of Angeles","What a stupendous everything; experience, Art, display of art, architecture, generosity of spirit, awe inspiring, lay out, design. I highly recommend The Broad to all. The Broad captures the essence of so much for so many. A must see and do, more than once. Thank you Mrs & Mr Broad.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JAR411
50,A Wonderful Gift of a Must See Contemporary Art Museum,"Go see this fantastic new museum right now! Then thank the donors, Eli and Edythe Broad (“Brode”), who have given LA and the rest of us (even from Brooklyn!) their wonderful collection in this amazing building for free. That includes free admission although you need a ticket to enter. Tickets can be reserved online, but they are already sold out through February. Walk-up onsite ticketing is also possible with wait times varied according to the time of day. The website notes anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours. My wait was under ten minutes at 4:00 on a Thursday afternoon, acting on info cheerfully provided by the museum staff the day before.The collection includes a wide range of mostly very large pieces of influential artists working from the 1950’s to yesterday. Although all your old friends are there to include such satisfying standards as a Jasper Johns flag, Lichtenstein’s ben day dots, some Joseph Beuys felt and Basquiat scrawls, there are plenty of other striking and challenging pieces as well, to include a strong representation of LA artists. The galleries are beautifully lit and the installations intelligent and spacious, with earnest and informed labeling. Most intriguing, hundreds of other works are in storage just waiting their turn on the stage.The building, of course, tells you right away there is something significant and maybe even mysterious inside, but what I found most refreshing is how inviting the space and the docents are. Security is surely there, but it is subtle and unobtrusive. The visible “guards” are all young artists, scholars and art lovers obviously chosen for their knowledge, dedication and sense of hospitality. They make sure you don’t touch, but they will also enthusiastically tell you all about any of the pieces. Sited on Grand Avenue next to the wonderful Disney Center, the Broad anchors what is becoming the serious, formal cultural center of the city.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EdgarCosset
50,"Awesome!! Free to get in, but have to pay for parking","Didn't have tickets, we waited in line about 40 minutes, they let the ticket holders in every 30 minutes, on the hour and half hour, then let in those in line, they took 50 of us after the ticket holders went in. First, get a time for the Infinity Light room, you are let in for 45 seconds, really cool!!!! Then, up the escalator to the art, take pictures, check it all out, but the best were the docents who are anxious to share their knowledge about the art, just ask them, they were GREAT! Small gift store, nice bathrooms, didn't see dining, but they have restaurants outside and coffee carts in the grass, and food trucks on the street. Gotta go back and spend more time with the art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JeffBransford
50,This magnificent beehive is exactly what Downtown needed!,"I work nearby, so I watched this thing rise from the ground up. It used to be a crummy parking lot full of pigeon squalor. I love art, so I looked forward to the museum's grand opening. We reserved our tickets in long in advance (we strongly recommend you book online) and visited on a Friday afternoon.The art starts before you step inside. The exterior of the building is a sight to behold. The first thing you should do upon entering is to get your name on the list for the Infinity Room. The Infinity Room is a confined art space filled with colored lights and mirrors, but it can only be viewed by one visitor at a time. Time slots for this installation are limited.Take the lift to the third floor and work your way back down the building. Enjoy the exhibits. What I love about the collection at the Broad is that so many of the pieces are whimsical and satirical. The Broad also features many renowned artists like Damian Hirst, Roy Lichtenstein, and Chuck Close. Take time to watch the film exhibits, too, but please don't use the film viewing rooms to check your phone and send text messages. I shouldn't have to say that, but some people are just ignorant or rude.Once you're finished perusing the uppermost gallery, come down the stairs and see the museum's inner workings on the second floor. There are some offices, but there is also a window into the museum's storage facility, where you can see the collection's pieces hanging on sliding indexable frames, much like the warehouse of doors in 'Monsters Inc.'Then head downstairs for a tour of the downstairs gallery. Even when you take your time in each gallery, you should finish your tour within 2 hours. Buy something fun at the gift shop on your way out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GumdropGirl
50,The Broad made a modern art lover out of me!,"I joined a group of friends from Claremont CA to go to The Broad last week in the afternoon. We were greeted outside by an enthusiastic woman who gave us an overview of the museum. We then entered and took the long escalator to the third floor. The architecture of the museum is definitely unique and surreal. The lighting of the art work through the oval windows allowed well focused natural light.The escalator ascends through a ""tunnel"" through the interior of the museum. I started off with the Andy Warhol exhibit featuring works that I had been familiar with since the 1960's. Several other artists from around the world were featured, in a space that allowed me to be private and personal with any of the works that I wished to interact more with. People were posted throughout the museum, several very knowledgeable and eager to share their insight into a particular artist. The variety of works pushed my conception of space, both physical and historical. The use of shapes, textures, colors, images were diverse and intimate.I walked down to the first floor passing the windows that opened on the collection storage areas. I was particularly struck with the work of Takashi Murakami, who long before the psychedelic age of the 1960's painted scenes that could have been straight from Alice in Wonderland.The entry area to the museum has some benches and the gift shop. The variety of merchandise in the gift shop was a bit disappointing, but it was the museum that I had come to see.To see the Infinity Mirrored Room, we were told we would have had to arrive early in the day to get an entry number.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AlisonS600
40,Great day spent soaking in some contemporary art,"A definite must go for art lovers. It's a free museum. Go early as the Q can be long. Minimum wait is 30 mins. Otherwise book online tho tix are fully booked way in advance. But you can still walk in. For those specifically going for the infinity mirror installation, try getting in before 12pm as reservations are full by then. After that you may still try to join the standby Q. On a busy day, wait for that entrance can be up till 2 hours. I waited 2.5hrs for a 45secs of experience in the mirrored room. Still worth the wait coming all the way for it. All in all, a day well spent",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Weilingho
50,Excellent new museum in an exhiting area of LA,"We made a beautiful weekend out of a visit downtoun, centered on the new Broad museum in Los Angeles. We stayed across the street at the Omni Hotel, attended an avante guard operetta at the Redcat Theater built into the Disney Hall complex and walked the street from the Music Center to the site of the closed Angel's Flight funicular.

50,A superb new Museum,The Broad is spectacular from the outside and has some great art work and installations inside. It is very light and spaced out and one can truly appreciate each piece of contemporary art either hung in the galleries or innovative installations and films.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tilda162
50,A new must see site in LA,"This museum is important both for its art and its architecture. The art is contemporary blue chip - all the big names from Warhol onward with few surprises. The private collectors who financed the building, purchased major works from major artists early in their careers. The result is a collection that is large and impressive, and that will give visitors a good introduction to one aspect of the contemporary art world - the part that is concerned with big names and money. Go elsewhere if you are interested in political art, socially engaged art, and for artists of color. Nevertheless, this museum does what it does well. The works are displayed beautifully, and the interior spaces were created to show off these major art works. The architecture is a real delight - a building that looks both space age and organic at the same time. LA is now a major cultural destination, and this is yet another example of why. And perhaps best of all, it is free. Just remember to get your reserved ticket online beforehand, to avoid the lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bookistan5
50,Impressive Collection in approachable setting,"By now everyone has told you the collection is phenomenal and they are right Imagine one family having all of this! The audio tours available on the app add a lot of background and often have commentary from Eli Broad himself on what made them like this piece or the story of the acquisition. If you are planning a trip they do have advanced tickets but only a limited number. We were there on a Sunday at 12:15 without advance ticket, didn't make that entry but got in at 12:30. The real bummer is getting into the light installation. It was already fully booked the day we went. They told us if you want to do that your best bet is a weekday before noon.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hidesertdweller
40,interesting collection,"this is brand new, a ""starchitect"" building in the LA downtown arts district. the Broads have amassed a huge collection of predominantly big-name modern artworks, largely dating from about 1970 to the present. For someone wanting to see the range of contemporary art, it is a starting point. For someone who has spent much time in other contemporary art museums, such as the LA MOCA, MassMOCA, the New Museum, etc, the Broad lacks some of the ""zing"" and depth that one would like to see. it is one couple's vision, and i am thankful that they have amassed it. however, it is not a place one would go back to over and over in expectation that a new vision of art on a theme, or an in-depth presentation of one artist might be shown. for that type of examination, one will likely go across the street to the LA MOCA, or to the Hammer, among other venues.so go, see the building, see more Damian Hirst and Jeff Koons than you will every want to see again.parking is not bad: aside from the lots serving the government buildings near the courthouse, there is 8$ parking (get the validation ticket from a museum worker) at the California Center, which is accessed really easily from the 4th st ramp off the 110 north.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/812jeffreyk

50,Great,We got to The Broad at 9:30 on a Sunday morning and had to queue for an hour as they let around fifty people in every half hour. We then immediately queued for the infinity room which was only a ten minute wait to register but a two hour wait (they text you when it's your turn) while we looked round the rest of the gallery. The architecture is amazing and the artworks are very accessible and varied. We spent over two hours there but only explored the top floor properly. There's another flood of equal size on the ground so you could easily spend most of the day there.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ben_blt
40,Great new museum (Worth the 30 minutes wait),This is a great collection for the average audience (like me).

Im not an art-affectionado but I found the majority of the pieces interesting and made me think, definitely worth a visit especially with free entry.I got in fairly easily (friday early afternoon) but there was a queue forming as I left so bare that in mind.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/19AndyC90
50,"Iconic Modern Pieces, Interesting Architecture","We visited the Broad yesterday -- without tickets and were able to get in with about a 1/2 hour wait--and it was worth it. The building is very interesting and some of the art is outstanding. We really enjoyed the Jeff Koons pieces, particularly the baloon dog and the rabbit, the Ellsworth Kelleys, and the Lichtensteins, as well as Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup cans, and the Jasper Johns American Flag--and many others. The size of the inaugural exhibit is good--we spent about an hour and a half and saw everything except the specially ticketed mirror room.After visiting the museum we had a wonderful lunch at the new Otium restaurant in the adjacent plaza. Altogether a very pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PickyTravelerMDR
30,Certainly NO must,"We love art, but the Broad is most certainly not a must see. It is an exhibition of art collected by the Broad family. The art works are nice, but not cutting edge or really thrilling. If you never see art then it might be interesting. If you are a regular visitor of art museums, then it is highly unlikely that you will find anything thrilling in this museum.The building is not very nice, even though the elevator is nicely configured.The Broad is not worth the visit if you have limited time. The LACMA is in that case your preferred option. The Broad is rather mediocre.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/364Jaap_v
50,A must see in LA,"A wonderland of fantastic, fun pieces in one place that were legendary - Koons, Lichtenstein. Murakami and beyond. The Infinity Mirrored room is an absolute must - breathtaking! But go soon because the exhibit is not guaranteed to be there past March. And, arrive early for signup because it has been selling out, even in the middle of the week.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CVP626
50,New Museum,Beautiful new museum in the L.A. area. I even love the the stairway and elevator.The stairway is like a cave and has views of the stored art and the elevator is cylinder with a sky light.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/603lailar
50,The hot spot for Contemporary Art in Los Angeles,"The Broad is my new favorite museum. The layout is elegant and fresh, the architecture is superb and the art is top notch. All tickets are free but the waiting lost is long so put your order in now. Reserve an early ticket so you can check out the mirrored infinity room right away. Then proceed to explore the rest of the museum. My favorite room is the Ragnar Kjartansson music installation which is so hauntingly beautiful that I couldn't stop the tears from rolling down my face. The room that is covered in Takashi Murakami paintings is incredibly detailed. Go if you haven't yet!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/genevrav
50,Contemporary Art & Architectural Delights ...,"LA is very fortunate to have the contemporary art centric Broad family create a modern architectural marvel building, fill it with their world class collection - then allow Free entry for visitors. That's philanthropy at its best! We lucked into tickets & rode the Metro downtown to the Broad, it's collection is a priceless marvel. We enjoyed greatly and will return many times! Thank yo Broad Family! ...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Wonderful museum experience,"The Broad contains an encyclopedic collection of American contemporary art within an accessible and well-conceived building. Most of the best-known American artists of the past fifty years are represented, and the galleries are open and airy, making for a very pleasant tour.If you can't get advanced tickets on-line (I think they're full through March, 2016) line up outside by 10:30 AM on week-days, and you should gain admittance. (Week-ends are more problematic).When we visited, the cafeteria was not yet built, but for a wonderful lunch, run over to the Disney Center Deli.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/mplsmarko
30,Latest buzz in Los Angeles,"Only opened since September 2015, the Broad is the latest talk in town. To get tickets, reserve your tickets online (best chance to avoid waiting long). Most reserved tickets are already all booked out until end of the year, so my advice would be to go during a weekday to wait in line if you can't get an advance online ticket.The Broad has a pretty diverse collection of contemporary art pieces and installations, spanning over 3 floors. There's a mobile app that you can download in advance that has self-guided tours, which can prove to be rather informative about the art pieces or the architecture of this place. My favorites are Under The Table, The Visitors (you spend over an hour sitting there and watching a 9 screen installation of separate and simultaneous performances happening in the same house, which I find pretty interesting). And of course, the highlight of this museum is the Infinity Mirrored Room, which requires a separate reserved time slot on-site.Upon entering the museum, head straight to an iPad located on the 1st floor and enter your details. When I went, I was informed that there is a 5 hour waiting period (which ended up to be around 3 hours or so). You then receive a text that has a link to update you your waiting number, and basically use that waiting time to start your exploration of the museum.If you are not a fan of contemporary art, it is still worthwhile to visit the museum and admire its architecture. It's designed by world-renowned architectural firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler. I particularly enjoyed walking down the staircase that leads through the ""vault"" storage where they keep their art pieces.Either way, visit this place at least once just so you can brag to friends and family that you have been here.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/linaspiration
50,LA's hottest new art experience,"First - how do get a tix? All tix are free but with a specific time of entry. Most people are getting tix in advance online. BUT, as of mid-November, all tix are gone through early next year. So you're option is to go day-off and wait in line (like me). I got there at 11:15 (the museum opens at 11am). There were about 200 people in line for day-off tickets so the wait was more than an hour. (50 people from the line got in every 30 min).In line, staff hand out brochures and there is a free app with great info so use your time wisely by reading and planning ahead.The main entrance is cave-like, so take the big escalator up to the third floor and work your way down through the galleries (as the museum recommends).Most of the 20th century modern art collection is on the third floor with galleries for Warhol, Koon, Lichtenstein, Johns etc. Wide, tall, well lit galleries make it a pleasant museum going experience. Because crowds are restricted, you don't feel rushed or claustrophobic.From the third floor, take steps or elevator to the first floor. The second floor had offices but you can peak through windows to a huge storage area for art.The first is seemingly all 21st century art and will likely rotate. Make sure to go to gloat gallery to see the Murakami mural. I highly recommend the video -- The Visitors. Best to wait until the video restarts and watch from the beginning.There is a separate free tix requires for the Infinity room. If you're interested immediately upon entering on the first floor stand in line again to get a ticket. But the wait can be daunting -- five hours (!) when I went in.You can see the museum in a hour unless you are a committed lover of modern art.Because this is LA, it's definitely worth seeing soon for bragging rights.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RCStaab
40,Fantastic new museum,"This is a fabulous contemporary art museum with many great works of art. The Broads have good insight and taste which make up a nice collection here.Art work is well presented and thought out. The overall experience I had was that my visit was fun, interesting and actually rather glamorous. Staff is very polite and well organized. Entrance times are every half hour and only so many people are allowed in at a time which is very smart. A great weekend activity for everyone and anyone since admission is free for the first year it is open. Very generous of them!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Couture7
50,Don't Wait - Reserve Your Tickets Now!,"Eli and Edythe Broad have done it again - another free space to enjoy art in the heart of Downtown L.A. Tickets must be reserved online in advance; once you arrive you'll wait in line for a little bit until your entry time is called. Head straight for the kiosk where you can reserve your entry time for the Infinity Mirrored Room (or if you come first thing in the morning, you can just walk in). The museum is chock-full of really cool contemporary art. My favorite is Ragnar Kjartansson's The Visitors, a film shown on 9 screens which runs just over an hour. Another standout is Kara Walker's thought-provoking and disturbing work. There is no food within the museum per se, but there are many nearby restaurants for lunch before or after the museum. Across the street are the Disney Concert Hall and Museum of Contemporary Art. Nearby are the L.A. Central Library, Pershing Square and Grand Park, and Staples Center / L.A. Live are a short bus ride away. Both Pershing Square and L.A. Live will have ice skating rinks for the holidays.Tip: Park across the street at California Plaza ($8 all day with validation at the museum; parking at the Broad is $12 for 3 hours).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Travelgirl90049
40,Evocative,"Contemporary art is a love/hate relationship for me. I mostly don't get it. It seems if you make it big enough a museum will buy it, and The Broad is no exception to this. However, whether I like a piece or not, it often evokes an emotional response, and that alone can make it worth it. This museum has a great display space, good flow, lots of white space between works, so your mind isn't cluttered by one piece while examining another. The registration and wait to get into the mirrored room is frustrating, but worth it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AtlantaLadybugBarb
40,Good collection,"New museum in LA, modern and cool building, extensive collection of modern artists, including top-artists, like Lichtenstein, Wharhol, Basquiat etc.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kopilashvili
50,The BROAD,"I went to The Broad Oct. 24, 2015, we didn't think we'd be able to get in because we didn't have tickets but we waited in line for maybe 40 minutes and we were able to experience it. And it is indeed an experience. When you first enter you are met with a larger than life stack of plates, which is just a small taste of the other larger than life artwork they have displayed. We loved all the exhibits, but my favorite pieces were the ones by Jeff Koons, We weren't able to see the room with the infinity mirrors so we have to go back. But it is indeed a great museum and the tickets were free.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WonderWomanTee323
50,Spectacular Architecture and Amazing Contemporary Art,"The Broad is a gift to Los Angeles...It nestles next to Disney Hall and somehow does not compete with Disney's also extraordinary architecture. The Broads have a particular point of view in their wonderful private collection. The rooms are light filled, inviting and happy. The interior several story tunnel-like escalator, glass tube elevator and staircase are an amazing experience unto themselves. It is all free so that everyone has access!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kneedlersr
50,"Making Downtown L.A. Exciting, Again.","A ""must see"" if you are in the downtown L.A. area. A feast for the eyes. Everywhere you look, both inside and out, this new art museum is sure to please. From the ""cheese grate"" architecture of the building to the cave-like escalator and Star Trek ""beam me up, Scotty"" elevator and the pop art collection, you will not be disappointed. Entrance fee is free, but you will need a ticket that you can get on-line. Artists such as Koons, Litchenstein and Warhol are just some of the works you will see there. Another bonus is that the Disney Music Hall is right next door waiting for you to explore.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GoGlo1406
50,Great new addition to LA Art scene,I just brought my mother from out of town and we spent a great 2.5 hours visiting and time flew by with a great collection. The only bummer is restaurant is still not open and we had a horrendous time getting out of parking lot. We had validation ticket that did not work and dealt with an incompetent staff in the garage where it took us over 15 minutes to get out which somewhat made the great experience a little less great.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gaetanom741
50,Must see museum while you are in LA,"We made a trip to LA expressly to visit the new Broad Museum and it did not disappoint. Be sure to arrive early if you are unable to get the advanced tickets (avail on-line). All tickets are free but the queue starts about 10:15 for a 11:00am open and, from what we understand, there may be times when you can’t get in if it’s too crowded. Selection of contemporary art is just outstanding, especially considering this is a private collection. Big thumbs up!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rsk1333
50,Impressive collection showcased in a beautiful space,"I am a lover of many contemporary artists and their work, and the broad collection is exceptional. Mostly big-name artists like Koons, Basquiat, Hirst, Rauschenberg, etc. so if you are seeking lesser-known artists this is probably not the best choice for you, but honestly, it should be on everyone's must do list while in the LA area. It is interesting to see popular original art pieces that have been so overused as mass-produced prints and printed on various items, that you almost become desensitized to seeing the images. Basquiat's ""skull"" is housed here, and is an example of this for me personally, along with several Warhol pieces, like his popular Elvis screen prints. Be prepared for many, many people with their phone cameras at the ready - understandably, this place is social media central. The architecture of the structure itself is most impressive on its own. The layout makes sense and is quite easy to maneuver. A highlight of my visit, surprisingly, was a series of plexi glass panels that were placed at the landings in the stairwell, which provided a glimpse of the artwork not on display, being stored/hung in the massive art vault below the galleries. Docents were friendly and helpful. There is a small gift shop/area that carries some unique items, as well as the not-so-easy to find Basquiat China and Hirst folding chairs. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this museum is the fact that it is FREE. Such a wonderful gift to the LA arts community. That being said, it was very crowded when we were there (Saturday) but I imagine a bit of the chaos will dissipate after it has been open for awhile. Must put this on your LA to-do list.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LWM3575
50,A Visual Stimulant,"The Broad LA's newest museum is a must should you be planning a trip to the area.So much to see from Andy Warhol, John Curin, Roy Litchenstein, Jeff Koons and so many other wonderful artist. If the art was not enough the architecture is an art piece in its self. The flow from exhibit to exhibit leads you to new surprises. The ambiance is full of energy. It's not stuffy or quite people are happy and excited.I highly recommend visiting, you will not be disappointed. My two older children could not get enough of this place.Make sure to reserve your tickets online. There is parking at the museum and plenty of public parking across the street. Well located in downtown LA near freeways.If your lucky on your visit you may find some great food trucks outside.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lauramaldonado34
50,Totally Unexpected Museum,"What an amazing place to explore! This is the best museum I've experienced to date. This museum definitely has various mixed cultural exhibits with a fun, eclectic appeal to it. The paintings and photography is thought provoking, which takes you on a rollercoaster. The color scheme and imagery is spot on. I look forward to many future visits.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/reneehI7133ZA
50,This is a magnificent LA cultural experience!,"What a wonderful time we had at the museum… The art that was exhibited has been seen all over the world in so many other places… I am so glad that it has finally found its own permanent home. The museum is spacious and there is something to see everywhere that you look. The architecture is fantastic! Each room has its own special feel… What I loved about it the most is that the people were free to interact with the art and people were actually laughing and enjoying it… it was not a stuffy experience, but instead, it made the art come alive and people were coming alive all around us! And that included us! We were filled with joy and could not get enough of the place… You must go there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daveholden
40,Contemporary art in a super cool space,"Very new, very cool, very stylish. From the helpful staff to the amazing art and the building itself. The vault and the veil, dark to light. Loved it.

It is free but you pay for parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/traceyc36

50,Superb Museum Experience,"Just delightful aggregation of contemporary art in a magnificent building. Lots of helpful staff to help you navigate the experience, apps to download if you want a more personalized auido tour, but easy to walk through with good labeling and reasonable wayfinding for a museum. The building's architecture truly complements the collection. The Japanese artist Kusama light experience Infinity Mirrored Room --The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away, just brilliant (literally and figuratively)...just wish the wait wasn't so long or the experience so short. Truly terrific museum experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PlatinumHoney

How different to be in a world class museum that has actual, real modern art, not actually old art.","How different to be in a world class museum that has actual, real modern art, not actually old art. Artists represented who are alive, or recently dead. (Some died young.) I learned a lot. I loved the light that comes in through the bricks holes. It is beautiful, surprising, interesting and it works really well. It is bigger than it seems and they but art by the same artist in the same rooms, or close by, so you can see how they changed.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dollys533

50,Great collection and a must stop,"Broad Museum is a welcome addition to the art scene in Los Angeles area. Admission is free, but the weekend tickets are sold out until the second week of January. Your only option is show up early and line up in order to get access to the museum. The weekend we visited was unusually hot and the temperatures were in the mid to high nineties in the mid morning. Of course that did not stop people from lining up. It took us about 40 minutes after the museum’s opening to get in.The collection was great and was worth the wait in the heat.You can see the pictures at:travel4foodnart",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lovetobeinparis
50,Brilliant,"If you're in or visiting LA, and have an interest in art and architecture , this is a must.If you can, go online and book your day and time of entry, in advance, but be warned, it's heavily booked ( and free ).I arrived at about 10.30 am, about 30 minutes before opening,without a ticket, and joined the general admission line which stretched down the street for about 100 metres.Staff were very efficient, and I got in about 11.45,not too bad really.If you want to see the temporary exhibition get in as early as possible and register once inside before you do anything else.The building and art works are stunning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/maurieh
50,This museum is absolutely world class,"Just visited ""The Broad "" this afternoon. I must say I was overwhelmed with both the physical museum and the collection. This is not only fantastic addition to downtown but an enormous addition to the cultural life of Los Angeles. The experience was outstanding as was the art. This is world class and now it is a must see to anyone coming downtown. It exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to visit again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Srklaw7
40,Great addition to Los Angeles,"First impression was one of wonder and a bit of puzzlement. It's a glorious piece of architecture on Grand Ave but the entry leaves you un-wowed. The lobby area is dark and very grey. You are met by very friendly greeters and then face a long escalator up. At first you may not realize there are galleries on the first floor. The second floor is filled with lovely natural light. It is truly one of the nicer art spaces I have seen and that is the paradox. Some is fabulous and some is a puzzle. I went back a second time and liked it even better, concentrating on the art instead of the building. It is quite a collection and I thank the Broads for sharing it with us. It is a wonderful gift.Tip of the day for first time visitors: immediately proceed to the special exhibit to the left of the escalator. You must add your name to a very long list to get in. You will receive a text when it is your turn. Do not miss this. It is magical and that is all I want to say to save the element of surprise and wonder!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KG583
50,One of the best modern American art collections west of the Mississippi!,"The museum is free. We didn't make reservations on a Friday afternoon and fortunately, there wasn't a line. The docents and guards were helpful. The collection itself is phenomenal, from artists such as Lichtenstein, Johns, Koons to Murakami and Baldessari. I thought the layout was just fine. You don't even notice the building itself once you enter the galleries. There is no cafe there but you can walk across the street to MOCA and get food and drinks downstairs at Lemonade. I was impressed and look forward to returning!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CaShakuhachi_12
40,Beautiful and Confusing and Free,"I enjoyed my visit, the building is beautiful, but the layout inside is a bit of a maze.Take your time and sort out which way your going before you get started, you could miss something - I did :(It was great getting to see such amazing work from some of my favourite artist up close, but sometimes I felt like the space overwhelmed what we're meant to see, in other areas you felt like you crammed into a corner.The admission is free, but I wasn't able to register online, I went in person was given a ticket and told to return a few hours later. The people working here are so kind, insightful and ready to direct you to the washroom.I don't like the location, it was difficult to find food or a cafe nearby. The food selection next door was meh...There's free Wifi !!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MillsR_12
50,Run don't walk!,"OMG! Best museum in LA in my opinion. The County is great for some of the more classical pieces and permanent exhibits but the Broad is off the charts great for contemporary art. MOCA needs to step up its game for sure.Currently it is very popular so reserved tickets need to be acquired online early. The museum is free but parking was $12.00 the day of our visit. If you reserve a ticket you have an assigned time to enter and perhaps save some standing in line time. We chose to go at opening and wait in the regular line. We were there about 30 minutes early and were, maybe, 50th in line, maybe more, not sure. They let a few non reserved people in and then some reserved people and take turns that way. Our wait was about 45 min. maybe an hour. That sound like a lot but it was soooo worth it. If you want to see the infinity light installation you need to get to the kiosk first thing as it is another thing you need to sign up for early because of the controlled viewing and long line. Other than that, the museum is beautiful and lit perfectly and easy to navigate and view the art with minimal crowd issues. Another possible strategy would be to go in the last few hours of the day. When we left at 3pm it seemed you could get in rather easily, but you'd only have 2 hours in the museum, at least on Saturday. The museum cafe was still under construction when we were there but the restaurant right next door was deeelisciouuusss. If you add MOCA to your day and maybe a stroll or tour of the Disney Concert hall, you'd make a great day downtown. RUN to the Broad if nothing else. I mean it, RUN! :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StaceyQM
50,A don't miss experience,"Modern art is not art to many people, and there are some pieces on exhibit here that I believe makes that a true statement. However, most of the artwork is superb and wonderful. The pieces make statements about all of us and portrays the world in a manner that defies definition. It is a great viewing in a magnificent setting. The admission price is also great: $0.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/petetom
50,"Really cool, and worth the wait","Beautiful, striking new contemporary art museum in Downtown LA. Went same day without a ticket and waited in line for 25-30 minutes, not bad at all.

50,"A mind-blowing, existential experience.","If you are tired of the old masters head over to this sensational gallery. There is a lot of hype about this place so there are queues to get in and queues again to do the 'Infinity' exhibit. Tickets are booked out months ahead. I flew in from Australia not knowing if I would get in.There was a line of ticket holders then another line of about 50-60 of us standby folk. The queues are longest at the 11am opening time but I did get in after about a 20 min wait. Better to book months ahead to ensure a spot for Infinity. If you cannot book ahead then it is unlikely you will beat the rush for the Infinity experience. In that case go after lunch.There is a audio self guide but it did not really work out for me. I found it easier to read the info boards on each exhibit so that I could fully appreciate the work. Then do the souvenir photo. Sometimes juggling those damn headphones, player, camera plus a paper map sucks.The Broad is big and bold and mandatory viewing for every lover of modern art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/williamsN3015EP

40,FREE art museum in DTLA,"Artists and curators will quibble over this modern art collection. But the addition of a free art museum in downtown in LA is hard to knock. A perfect place for visiting couples and families to get a taste of a broad range of work - it's small enough to see in 1-2 hours, but there's enough to linger on for a 2-3 hour visit.

50,Best museum in LA,"I'm not a huge modern art enthusiast, but this amazing beehive of beauty left me giddy with discovery.Arrived 45 mins before the ticket holders were allowed in, and being without a ticket in hand, and standing about 30 people deep in the onsite ticket line, my daughter and I thought we may not get in during the first wave.But we (and about 70 others behind us) did get in just after the doors opened at 11 am.The docents were kind and helpful at every turn, even when reminding guests to back two feet away from the art.I loved the media piece The Visitors. Won't spoil it by trying to describe, but we stayed for all 64 minutes of it, laughing, pointing, and nearly crying from its joyful beauty.Highly recommend trying all three modes of transport to the third floor: stairs for a glimpse of the vault, escalator for that womblike exit, and the elevator for a futuristic rocket tune ride.

50,The Broad - New DTLA Modern Art Museum,"First off, the name rhymes with ROAD, not ROD. It is named after Eli and Edyth Broad. I was so excited for this museum to open, and upon my first visit I was definitely not disappointed. The building itself, which is not the original design, is still a unique look in the neighborhood. Admission is FREE, as long as you go online and reserve tickets. The art collection is awesome, and will rotate periodically. Two of my favorites - Jeff Koons and Roy Lichtenstein are nicely featured right now. The galleries are bright and spacious. If you need more modern art after visiting The Broad, then MOCA is right across the street. Also, Disney Concert Hall (a work of art in itself) is right across the other street. Although there are no dining facilities inside The Broad, there are several options within walking distance.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/stevew11

Glass elevator, tunnel, plaza gardens - all beautiful, up to date modern yet not cold and unapproachable. Great photo ops. No flash.

Many new eating experiences within walking distance. Love it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Suzanne7Losangeles
50,World Class Art,The opening of The Broad is the most electrifying event in the art world in the Fall of 2015 and perhaps the whole year. It is a powerful collection of contemporary genius presented in an aesthetically crafted structure. It is a museum that can make the City of Los Angeles and The Broad proud to be considered a must see destination for contemporary art lovers.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/normana698
50,Spectacular,"I'm not a huge fan of contemporary art, but the architecture of this place is AMAZING. A must go destination in downtown LA if you are an architecture fan. Very original layout and circulation which I thought works very well. The effect of the light via the exterior veil into the main exhibition space on the third floor is very cool. One exhibit really not to miss is ""the visitors"" on the ground floor...I was mesmerised for close to one hour. Overall, a wonderful new museum to visit in downtown LA.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BigSur707
50,OMGGGG the best new museum in LA!,"I LOVE THE BROAD. It's such a unique building and the space is not overwhelming. I felt completely competent visiting on my own. Parking was easy (though not inexpensive) but the museum itself is free, so it balances out. They have a fantastic gift shop, and the galleries are full of all the usual suspects when it comes to modern art. I was very impressed by the two installation pieces that are currently up as well. Very good curating. Can't wait to go again. I recommend this place for visitors to LA for sure!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SparrowFox
50,Small but Classy Museum,"Went to The Broad for the first time today (10.06.2015). It's not a large museum but its collection of contemporary art is pretty spectacular. Great balloon dog and tulips by Jeff Koons, paintings by Jasper Johns, Ed Ruscha, Cy Twombly, Ellsworth Kelly, Basquiat, Warhol and many others. Photography by Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky. One surprising artist that is missing is Jackson Pollock. You only need about two hours but it's two hours well-spent. As an added bonus, MoCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) is located across the street, and the Disney Concert Hall is next door. Pretty amazing when you consider that this represents one couple's collection. I really liked The Broad. Highly recommended if you are a fan of contemporary art.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TravelsWithStephen
30,free admission,"The Museum: Museum is on 1st & 3rd floor. 2nd floor is restroom, conference room and the administration offices.From outside the building looks huge but limited artworks compared to other museums in LA. It won't take too long to finish the whole museum. Didn't like the layout of the museum, very confusing, like a maze?Now they are offering FREE admission tickets. Reserve the tickets on their website.Once arrive , there are two lines for general admission and also on-site tickets (limited tickets offered per day and wait line is long). For the online reserved general admission tickets, they are timed entrance, every half an hour. They will start let you wait in line 30 minutes before your appointment time.The Parking:1.

30,IT IS FREE,"Something to see but probably just one time and it is free. The architecture is interesting. If you love contemporary art, you will enjoy this museum. Not that great for young children, as the art can be disturbing and some pieces lean towards pornographic. Most of the artist are unknowns. Takashi Murakami's art is colorful and fabulous. Too much Jeffrey Koons….boring. Just my opinion. The art was not so much cutting edge as it was artist pushing boundaries. There are some rare fine pieces. I gave up on trying to intellectualize what message or political statement the artist was trying to convey. As I said, it is worth a visit and it is free. Tickets ahead of time (on-line) are advised. We did get in without a long wait in the stand-by line. (By the way I am an artist with a degree in art/art history and I remind myself that ""beauty is all in the eye of the beholder"").",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GailySanDiego
50,Very Interesting architecture and collections - Parking tip !,"We went to the Broad last week, one week after their opening. We have heard that we need to reserve the tickets for the museum and when we called, of course the tickets were all booked until November.We decided just go and take a chance.…well, we were lucky !The line for non-ticket was not long, about 20 person in front of us, while the line for people with tickets was short. After 7 minutes, they announced they will get 50 people in and we went in.The museum was very well organized, many people in uniform readily to assist.We thought the inside was as interesting as the outside. I won't go to details since you can google and see more details and also, I won't want to be a spoiler.Here is the tip for you all.-Park the car at the corner of Olive and 2nd street, here were quite a few of them, one at $6.00 flat fee for the day, another one at the other corner charges $8.00 flat fee per day and a little further down at Olive and 1st street at $10 flat fee per day. We parked there and walked up.-If you don't want to get the tickets ahead, go in the afternoon (we went there at 5pm), it will take about 2 hours to throughly visit all the collections.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HowQute
40,"Amazing collection, weird flow","I was thrilled to get tickets for the first week of the Broad's debut despite it being booked. I reached out to the ticket office and they kindly accommodated my schedule on a quick trip to LA. I have been curious to see Kasuma's Infinity Room for years, and it is as magical as I could have imagined. We arrived at 11am as the museum opened, and the kiosk line to schedule an experience (they'll send a text when it's your turn) in the Infinity Rm was as long as the admission line, but we only waited about 40 minutes. If it is a priority, I suggest visiting the museum early.The collection is amazing....The flow of the space on the first floor felt clean, but the third floor exhibit is somewhat chaotic.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MountainBeach11
50,The Broad Museum,"New contemporary art museum ~ built to house galleries and store the collection of about 2,000 works of art from the Broad collection. The “veil” is the exterior you see from the street and the “vault” houses the collection. The escalator takes you from the street through the vault and up to the galleries on the third floor. The third floor gallery is bright and open, “35,000 square feet of column-free space.” There is another smaller gallery on the first floor. Overall, lots to see . . . check out Yayoi Kusama's Infinity Mirrored Room and the 82-foot-long painting by Takashi Murakami, In the Land of the Dead, Stepping on the Tail of a Rainbow.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CMc818
20,Great potential. We're waiting...hoping...,"This brand new and quite spectacular museum has everything money can buy, from exciting architecture to a collection of blue-chip ""masterpieces."" The art is very large, colorful, shiny. If you know nothing about contemporary art, you may find the experience appealing for its sheer scale and glitter. If you know something about contemporary art the experience may leave you cold. I've never seen so much wonderful art and felt so little in its presence. A room full of Jeff Koons...totally flat. The Broad has everything it needs. Now...what will its curatorial team do with it?",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Josh547
