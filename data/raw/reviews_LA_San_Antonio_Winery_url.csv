50,Great local winery,"Was a guest for the Tournament of Roses and this was one of our offsite dinners. Such hospitable hosts who shared with us the history of the winery and a short tour. Unfortunately, they can't send to Indiana so we'll have to be back.",Francene C

40,Fun local wine tasting,"We have been wanting to go here for a long time as we always see their sign from the 5 Freeway. Made it there yesterday with our daughter/son-in-law. The wine shop is good sized with selections from all of the brands owned by San Antonio. There are ""Premium"" and a regular tasting options. We got 2 of each among the 4 of us. The premium wines were very good, I am partial to Cabernet Sauvignon and did like that the best. We ended up purchasing a Cab and a bottle of the ""Chocolate Bar"" Port as a dessert wine.",David G
40,Wonderful Ambiance!!,"Food was good, wine plentiful, and the gift shop was great. Service was wonderful as well. Would definitely recommend.",paharlen

50,"Perfect Pairings! Family, Wine, and Food!","The most important thing is to get up and get down to the San Antonio Winery and indulge in this experience for yourself. Everything about this establishment spells perfection. All you need to do is decide what you want to do; wine tour, wine taste, wine shop and or have a fabulous meal in the restaurant. All 5 star ideas! I frequent the winery often to pick up a few bottles and/or have a bite of delicious food. This Thanksgiving holiday we hosted a small dinner party for family and friends. A great time was had by all. Giorgio, thank you and a special shout out to our head waiter Martin, a wonderful host and attention to detail, were the icing on the cake, or should i say the cork out of that perfect bottle of wine! Perfezionare!",MoAuggie
50,Tour and Tasting,"My tour guide was Bruce, he was phenomenal! He did a great job of story telling and making sure we had all the information as well. My tasting was done by Ben, he did a great job of connecting, and was very personable. He also gave me other sights to see in the area. Luana checked me out and she was funny and easy to work with. Overall staff was amazing and I will be visiting again and bringing friends with me!",Kelsey T
50,Excellent Food and a Gorgeous Venue,"The food is great, and not surprisingly, the wine pairings are quite good. My wife had a wonderful Riesling with lunch and she commented on how gracious the sommelier was as he poured and described the wine. Our food was wonderful. I had a pastrami sandwich and I am firm in my belief that the absolute best pastrami Los Angeles is had at a well known deli near MacArthur Park. This ranked up with that, but my wife remarked that the bread at the San Antonio Winery made this a better sandwich. She noted that it's hard to find an excellent rye bread and that this one was perfect. I am a diehard loyalist to the other place, but this sandwich was excellent. We sat long enough that I decided to try the carrot cake which had a nice creamy frosting - couldn't resist. We stopped by the tasting area and took a couple of bottles and a few gifts for family with us. This is really a hidden gem in Los Angeles.",RangerBobN
50,great time at San Antonio Winery,"A group of us visited San Antonio Winery in LA for a tour and tasting. The staff and event could not have been better and exceeded our expectations on every level! Anna Marie and Dominic were wonderful, knowledgeable and accommodating. They served us several varieties of wines and our tasting was in a private barrel room which gave the event a wonderful ambiance and we were never rushed. The tour was informative and we even go to meet the owner! We stayed for dinner in Maddalena restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. I would highly recommend a visit to San Antonio Winery. They offer an overall great experience and a wide selection of wines for every taste!",Trek103066

40,Fun Place to Eat and Shop!,"Not the best neighborhood, but the ambiance, food and gift store make it a worthwhile outing.

50,Great jewel in the Industrial district of LA,"Excellent choice to take visitors from out of town. The food is varied and reasonably price and the free 20-minute tour is an awesome step back in LA history and how an Italian owned winery survived the Prohibition era, plus details on the making of the 4 different types of wine they sell. You will not be disappointed.",Paul R
50,A Lovely LA Evening at the San Antonio Winery,"Just had dinner this past Friday at the San Antonio Winery. Had a lovely evening. The winery has on site parking, a large banquet room , extensive gifts shop, and wide selection of wines. We arrived at 5:30 and were advised that we had to order before 6:00 as the facility closes at 7:00 on Fridays. So be careful about timing if you choose to eat there. If you plan ahead, you can combine one of their daily tours with your lunch or dinner.The food offerings are displayed outside of dining room and one orders, cafeteria style, then the food is brought to your table. We ordered vegetarian lasagna, grilled pastrami sandwich, salmon, and a salad. The portions were a generous size and everyone liked their selections. We also ordered a bottle ($31) of San Simeon Cabernet and thought it was very good. The winery is located NE of China Town. Coming from the North, we found that the 210 Fwy. was the best route.",Motogo605
50,My daughters first visit!,"I had not enjoyed the San Antonio Winery in over 20 years. I had been to LA, numerous times, just had not made the time to go by.Has it changed, and for the better! I’m not one usually enthusiastic about change and growth, but it’s morphed into a true food and wine destination. My hat is off to the family for its rejuvenation to a winery that I think was always overlooked for its quality.",iflyuasea
30,The wine is good but dinner is cafeteria-style,"I have always been curious about San Antonio Winery, and while I did not do a tour of the facilities, my friends and I were in the area around suppertime and thought we'd try the restaurant. The place is in a dusty, industrial area east of downtown Los Angeles. What you at first think is the restaurant is a building with a locked gate.. Down that side-street you see large industrial warehouses and only after a trip around the block did we spot the entrance to the restaurant. It's rather confusing.Inside, you find yourself in a large wine-tasting room that opens into an equally large and well-stocked gift shop. Lots of cute items and wines from various sources to browse and buy.Then you enter the dining room, a big, busy room with displays of each dish under plastic wrap at the start of a cafeteria-style counter. No menu is posted or available. You make your selection, move ahead to the beverage selection and then the cashier before finding a table. Everyone is given a sign on a metal stand, indicating theirher food selection, and you sit until waiters bring the food and wine. Even though each of us had a 10"" sign sitting in front of us, there was still confusion as to who'd ordered the spaghetti versus the pastrami sandwich or shrimp salad. Funny, but ridiculous.The food is OK, as cafeteria food goes. The place is clean and not horrible. The staff are friendly, but it's exactly the type of place you expect to find when you step off a bus tour at the designated dinner stop.",Cheryl M
50,A wonderful family winery hidden in LA,"I visited San Antonio and was absolutely impressed by the winery itself, it’s history, a great range of tasting options but mostly by the wonderful staff that clearly love working there. The tour is great and free, you should take a glass of wine on the tour! I left thoroughly impressed!",-Guzzis-are-ace-
50,"An amazing day. Got here early, around 10 or 11, and took the tour","then had lunch, which goes very fast because it's cafeteria style. Delicious food, and large servings! We had wine with lunch, and more wine tasting afterwards! A really fun day. The gals enjoyed it!",WalkingInLA
50,Number One In My Book,"I have now visited LA’s hidden treasure San Antonio Winery two times in the past month and each time my experience was better.

50,This was a hidden gem,"We ate lunch there and had the buffet. It was absolutely great. The food was delicious, the wine choices were great but we went with the a simple one. This may be the last winery in LA and is still operated by the founding family. I would not miss this one.",Randy S
50,Wonderful local winery,"This little winery is a hidden gem. Not only was the wine delicious, but we received wonderful personalized service from Hector. He has worked there for 35+ years and he shared his wealth of experience with us. We even stopped for a little snack and the food was really good, as well. If you are in LA, I highly recommend stopping by!",Kelli H
50,Great old school winery to taste and to have a tasty meal!,"After many years of seeing signs and advertisements for this winery, the oldest in Los Angeles, we ventured the very short distance off of I-5 near downtown and had a pleasant treat. The neighborhood is kind of industrial for the 3-4 blocks it takes to get there, but the winery is in fantastic shape and there is plenty of on site parking. You enter into the tasting room, and you can taste all the way from the $5 Italian red they have been making since the '30's, all the way up to some fantastic red blends, cabs, chardonnays, coming out of family vineyards in both Napa and the Paso Robles areas. As you pass through the tasting room/gift shop, be sure to read the old news articles about the winery and family history, and then enter the dining area. The entrees are all presented on a table as you enter. When you see one you like step up to the counter, place your order, pay at the end after selecting your beverage, and find a seat. They bring your meal with a smile and great attention. We shared the lasagna and it was soo! good. Be sure to check out all the barrels along the wall, some over 3000 gallons. Quite impressive!",george p
50,"""The Last Remaining Winery Within the City of Los Angeles!""","I've been going to the Winery for over 30 years and it has yet to ever disappoint me. This is a great first date place or a 30 year wedding anniversary location. You can plan all types of events here from retirements to wedding stuff as well as just having a great meal.The food is displayed for you, as you walk in, in order to help you best decide. I highly recommend the spaghetti plate as listed below. If you plan on drinking wine with your meal, be prepared to stay a while. It is very relaxing in this location and you will not want to leave. There is also a small patio area outside to also enjoy your wine. The wine tasting will keep you long than expected and the wine Staff are subject matter experts.Hint...things really begin to pick up after Halloween due to the holidays. Once you take the walk inside, you will think of at least a half a dozen events that you would like to host there. Plan accordingly. If you plan on purchasing wine as a gift for the holidays, the doors open up at 9AM and it is non stop until closing. Thanks. Hope this helps. See you there. I just bought four bottles of their house Merlot and their white wine.",2MARY9

50,Generous tasting,"Came here after a whole afternoon of navigating through LA traffic and shopping in the LA heat. So the stop here was an absolute delight. Did a wine tasting of 4 different wines at $5 and they were very generous with the pours, what a deal!! The more you buy the cheaper the price, bought 30bottles of wine! Happy indeed!",PinnedForTravel
50,A gem in downtown LA,"I was not expecting to be amazed by a winery in the heart of Los Angeles, but this place turned out to be an excellent alternative for a California winery experience without having to do the 2-3 hour drive to Santa Barbara or Ojai. They have a great selection of wines to taste, a fun tour of the winery that gives some interesting history about the California wine industry, and pretty generous tasting sample. I plan to visit again on my next trip to LA.",cornellpaul
50,What an amazing find!,"We were trying to find a nice place to explore in LA for our last couple of hours in town, and Google helped us find this winery. We definitely got more than we bargained for! This place has fantastic options for even people who do not like wine. The food choices, candy choices, and non-alcoholic drinks choices are excellent. Service is wonderful too; we were given two juice samples for free when we bought coffee and enquired about the juice. I highly recommend at least tasting the juice. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we will return the next time we find ourselves in the Los Angeles area.",mont_sebastian
50,Charming surprise,"Went for first time yesterday since we love the Maddelana brand wines. The restaurant was very nice experience with live music and very attentive staff. The serving style is cafeteria style, but very good food. You can decide what you want from display, order inline including wine by glass or bottle and then staff takes your drinks and sides to table. Entree is brought when ready. Service is fast, but quality is very good and you are not rushed. We skipped the tasting, but take home a bunch of wine from the store. There is less formal deli and some outdoor tables. Onsite parking is plentiful and secure. All in all a great experience! Totally not expected for the neighborhood.",Dave W

Still owned and operated by the same family. The wine and food is not your Westside snob variety, but it down right enjoyable. You can sense the friendliness and dedicated effort here. But they close at 7 (last meal has to be ordered by 6PM). No body comes to this neighborhood after sundown.",Walter T
40,Interesting tour plus a great meal.,"We went to the San Antonio Winery for a friends birthday party a few weeks ago and had a great time. We had a couple glasses of wine while waiting for the short tour to begin. The grandson of owner, I forgot his name, was our guide through the bottling area and ageing rooms and told us about his family history and how they came to open the winery. After the tour we lined up to enter the cafeteria style restaurant. Upon entering the room you will see a table with all the different offerings displayed for your inspection so you can see exactly what your ordering, you then proceed down the line completing your order and checking out. A waiter then brings your order to your table. The room has a great ambience, but being a Sunday afternoon was quite crowded. I ordered swordfish with lemon caper sauce and bowtie pasta and enjoyed the tastiest, most juicy piece of fish I'd had in a long time. The rest of our party all commented on how much they all enjoyed their meals as well. After dinner we all went into the store and purchased several bottles of wine, my favorite being the Peach Moscato. It was a nice afternoon and I will definitely return for some more swordfish and to restock my supply of wine.",ragsdad aka Dusty Katz

50,Lunch with friends,"WowThis place is big and it’s amazing. Bit hard to find. The address is not the entrance but the entrance to the parking lot is just past it. I walk in and see a huge selection of wines. Then walk around to a gift shop area then to the actual restaurant. It’s cafe style. They have the dishes places up front to view. Once u chose a dish, u let the person behind the counter, then drinks, then cash out. There are employees that then asssit u to a table ( we actually grabbed a table first...) live music that day ( nothing fancy )Service was amazing, food was good and large portions, atmosphere was fun.

40,GREAT EARLY DINNER!!!,"We were a party of four and were there approximately 3hours. I had the Lasagna which was excellent. My husband had the Salmon, it was a bit dry, but well seasoned. Had a bottle of their brand, Maddalena Reisling,which was excellent. There was a g guitarist that played very very well. I thoroughly enjoyed our evening out after dinner we went through their gift shop as they have such a diverse selection of wonderful gifts, I always have find something I absolutely love and have to have. Once we were exiting the gift shop we went over to the wine tasting bar and we were assisted by Antonio, who was so very attentive. Thanks to him after a bit of sampling we carried out a few bottles of wine, including the Maddelena Riesling. It was a wonderful evening and we can't wait to go back, I love this place.",CapitanaSpanky
50,"Great food, great wine!","We visited the winery as part of a tour group for the Rose Bowl Parade, therefore, for lunch, we were not given the option of what to order, but the food was fantastic! We were served buffet-style chicken, lasagna, mashed potatoes, salad, rolls, and a cannoli. The atmosphere and décor is stunning. We then shopped the gift shop, which has a lot of wine-themed decorations/items for purchase, as well as an extensive selection of bottled wine to purchase. They also have wine-tasting, but we did not participate in that. While I was deciding on what wine to purchase, two employees offered assistance in helping me to pick out what wines to purchase, which was very much appreciated. We chose several bottles of wine and we were able to have the wine shipped from CA to PA. It was very nice to not have to pack the bottles of wine in our luggage and have the shipping and everything taken care of right there. The cashier, Hector, was extremely nice and helpful, which put the cherry on top for our wonderful visit to the winery. If given the opportunity, we would certainly return to the San Antonio Winery.",LauraandThomas

We are already counting the days, or should I say bottles, until we go back again. 1 down, 11 to go.",chevdiver
40,A winery in Los Angeles? Who knew?,"I am an Angeleno, born and bred, yet, I had never heard of the San Antonio Winery, located in the heart of L.A., until a friend invited me to her birthday party to be held at the historic location. I think it's definitely a place to visit at least once, especially out-of-towners. There is a wine tasting room, a charcuterie, and a large dining room with adjoining smaller rooms for private parties. So, there is a little something for everyone. The only negative thing I have to say about my experience is that the line for food and the way it was delivered/served was a bit Disneyland-esque. It was extremely efficient but definitely lacking love. Just felt like everything was part of an assembly line. However, the food was good. I had the chicken marsala with pasta and veggies, and it was way more than I could eat. I took home about 3/4 of it. Everyone seemed to enjoy their choice with the exception of the shrimp and pasta. Not a hit. There is a cute little store within the winery that has unique gifts as well as bottles of wine. If you go, plan to spend a couple of hours eating, drinking, and shopping.",Karin W

Great old black and white photos of the original owner and family. Inside is a beautiful tasting room and separate dining room. They serve cafeteria style but have servers bring your food to your table when ready so you can enjoy a glass of vino while waiting. All food served hot and delicious, but also really good sandwiches or salads. Plenty of food in the order so it's a good value for the money. Very friendly and helpful staff. I go whenever I'm in the neighborhood. Check it out.",HappyTraveler0109
50,Pleasantly surprised,What a discovery. Today was my first of and hopefully many visits to The San Antonio Winery. A family member invited my girlfriend and I for her husband's birthday. We had a great time. I am not much of a wine drinker but my girlfriend likes wine. Stella Rosa to be exact. As luck would have it San Antonio Winery is a major distributor of Stella Rosa wines. We were able to sample flavors we haven't seen before. We were hooked before we even sat down for dinner.The food there looked amazing. Very nice and friendly staff. This is the type of place you want to see if lived here or were visiting here. I highly recommend The San Antonio Winery. Hopefully I may meet you here.,Korey H
40,Not your average cafeteria,"So, this place is a bit odd. Tucked quietly into the far corner of an industrial area stands The San Antonio Winery. The service was excellent and the food was great, as for the delivery well... To start they close early, service ends at 6:30pm, closes at 7:00pm. It's a cafeteria hybrid, you get a tray, tell them what you want. There is no menu you just look at the dishes on display and say ""that one"". The sides are immediately placed on the tray and the main gets delivered to the table. The main will come out almost instantly as well, as for speed of service 5+ stars. All and all its a great place and a good value. I think once you gone once and have gotten the hang of it going again would be a breeze.",ATravelerCalifornia
40,Nice cafeteria style restaurant,"Although most people probably go here for the wines, the best aspect has to fro with their food. Served cafeteria style, the coaches are bored and the portions are large.They have a fine gift shop as well as a wine shop and tours.",BlakievanHemert
50,Never displeased,"Stopped in for lunch, once again an excellent meal. Had the chicken cacciatore. Chicken was cooked excellently, pasta was yummy. Comes with salad and bread.

Also, great shopping on the way out.",paula k
50,Great!!,Tom assisted us and made for a wonderful experience at the winery. Not a bad wine in the house. Every variety was enjoyable and the staff made the experience one to repeat when back in town. Will NOT disappoint;),Raken111
50,Great combo of wine and food!!!,"It's always a treat going to the Winery. There is plenty of parking and plenty of shopping in the store for memorabilia and some of the best wine ever!!! The menu has changed to include breakfast omelets along with baby back ribs as just a couple of new items. The salads are ginormous and filling. The atmosphere is amazing and there is a guitarist playing some jazz as you eat and mingle during the lunch hour. The food is some of the best food I have had. The ribs, pastrami sandwiches, spaghetti, lasagna, etc is so good! If you have never had any of the Stella Rosa wines then you are in for a treat! The wines are so good....and you can do some taste testing! To top off all of this is their hospitality! The Riboli family displays some of the best customer service and attention that you could ever want in a restaurant. The Riboli family really know how to make you feel welcome by extending their hospitality by showering you with attention and paying attention to details. Located in the downtown area it is a historical landmark that must be seen.",Jeane141
30,Who knew?,"A winery in the industrial section of LA? Yes indeed! We went there with a large group for a celebration luncheon. They have private dining areas, which worked well. There is a tasting room and the staff appeared knowledgeable. They give tours of the winery (grapes are from other areas and the juice is trucked in to be fermented, blended and cask aged). There is a wide selection of food in a cafeteria-like setting (pastas, salads, specials). Unfortunately, the pasta in all cases was w-a-a-a-y paste ""el dente"" - it was ""el mushe"" and the sauces were bland. Fun place, but I know of many places with much better food",Ron C
30,Worth visiting for wine history lovers,"I came for a visit at the very least to say that I was one of the oldest wineries in California. The wines were good, but there wasn't much more info on the winery beyond what your next pour would be. Since they are a large scale commercial winery that also owns Stella Rose, there are a wide variety of wines to choose from; not only to taste but to also purchase in their tasting room. The tasting room is definitely on the kitchy side, but the group I was visiting with definitely enjoyed our lunch at the restaurant.",Brandy G
50,Wine from the Heart of LA,"Don't be put off by the gritty (but safe) industrial neighborhood. Once inside, a visit to this historical landmark feels like a day with family. The Italian family who opened the winery in 1917 kept it alive through prohibition by making wine for the Catholic Church -- and they still do. On the free tour, you can still see a few of the original redwood barrels (now replaced by steel) that were used to make wine from grapes that were harvested all over California.100 years later, the same family still owns the place, and it has been lovingly restored many times with cool touches, like barrel staves paneling some of the private rooms and pieces of the original buildings. Kids will like watching the contraptions that put the corks, foils and labels on the bottles.There's no ""menu"" in the Maddalena restaurant -- samples of the day's offerings are on display with the price. You order and pay, and they serve the entrees at your table. My lobster ravioli and side salad were fresh and delicious at a reasonable price. Wine Tasting is only $5 -- or $15 for the higher-end flight (bring your ID). You've probably heard of the massive Stella Rosa brand made here, but there are also estate wines from Paso Robles to discover. The cute wine-themed items in the gift shop made me smile. Pure California gold. And free parking!",Terry Anzur
50,Wine tasting a great lunch w/ambiance,"Just wanted to do a little wine tasting , have a great lunch with out traveling 2 hours to wine country. San Antonio Winery and Maddalena's restaurant were perfect. Located in Downtown Los Angeles a few blocks from the likes of Olvera Street and Chinatown you only need a couple of hours to get your wine tasting fix and hunger satisfied to rest. They also have winery tours and rich history within their walls worth going for. Give it a try you wont be disappointed.",Mike M
50,Worth a visit,"We went for lunch and couldn't have been happier. The four of us placed our order using the actual entree display (what a great idea!), paid and were seated by one of the staff. Lunch was delivered and enjoyed by all. We then spent some time browsing through the extensive gift shop and proceeded to the wine tasting. There are two choices both modestly priced: a $5 and a $15 sampling. Our ""sommelier"" was fun, knowledgeable, and interesting to talk with about the winery and the wines offered.",Kathy B
50,Excellent wine and food,"Celebrated a friend's retirement at lunch on March 14; loved the salmon salad. Courteous staff, nice ambiance and delicious food. Highly recommend the San Antonio Winery.",katlover241
40,Good food usually,"I would have given this 5 stars, we go often and yesterday was the first negative time. One of the secretaries had the Rib Eye Sandwich, and she is not a person to complain but it had so much gristle in it, she couldn't eat it.The waiter had the manager come over, and instead of getting her something else or giving her money back they made another one and of course all of us were through with lunch before they made it.. had they of let her have something else that would of been faster, but no, she had to have it packed to go and when she got back to work, too much work was waiting. We were all upset about the oversight.....However that is the first time ever. The person who had the Ahi Ahi salad said it was very fresh, in fact better than Roys, so that is a biggie.It isn't open at night, not sure if it is only open to 5 or 6 pm but it would be nice to be able to have dinner there.Maybe because it was valentines day, they had music which was a bit to loud to visit, a back ground music would have been so much better.The shop is full of wonderful goodies, and the wine samples are wonderful..Enjoy,",Ella O
50,A great day with girlfriends,"I love the San Antonio Winery. I go there with girlfriends at least once a year if not more. We were just there today for a pre Super Bowls wine tasting and lunch. The staff are so friendly and offer suggestions about what you might like. Today we had Hector as our wine pourer, We all loved him because he was so engaging and made us fell so welcome. Lunch was so good bought a bottle of wine for that.",Carol T
50,Excellent lunch & (complimentary) wine tastings,"After visiting the Autry Museum of the American West, we came here for lunch and wine tastings. It made for a perfect day! :)The restaurant is really a ""bistro"" where you look at prepared food (instead of a printed menu) and order from the counter what you'd like to eat. That's a great concept so you can see exactly what you'll be getting and the portion size. Then, you move down the counter to order your beverage and pay for your meal - then they seat you and bring your food as it is prepared.One of us had the ""Rib Eye Sandwich"" whilst the other two shared a ""Meatball Sandwich"". The ""Rib Eye Sandwich"" was very good as was the ""Meatball Sandwich"". Only comment I can make is that I prefer meatballs with more substance and these were on the soft size....no big deal, though. Lunchtime entertainment was a Saxophone player.Would definitely recommend both the bistro and the (complimentary) wine tasting. :DIf you can get MATT to help you with the wine tasting, you'll be very pleased as he is knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.Cheers! :D",AvidTraveler507

50,Girls night out,"A group of my friends decided for the new year we would hang out more and no cellphones. This was my 1st time at the restaurant. I ordered the steak, it was great especially the steak fries. My friend ordered the chicken with mushroom sauce, I tasted her chicken and it was amazing. We had a great time and plenty of laughs. The service was excellent. After dinner we went wine tasting. I left with 5 bottles. I will definitely come again. Don't let the drive to the place scare you. The whole atmosphere was beautiful.",Shelly K
50,Winery lunch,"As part of our Rose Parade Tour we had lunch at the San Antonio Winery. It was Italian food served buffet style with 3 main entree's to choose from. They had 2 bottles of wine on the table, one white wine and one red wine and Italian bread, all as part of the meal. Everything was tasty and there was time left to sample and shop several wines in their store/gift shop. There was plenty of people to help with tasting, questions or purchasing.",saminkc
50,Very very nece lunch and ambiance,"We loved this place! We were there for lunch. There isn't really a menu but, they offer 2-3 entrees of Italian cuisine each day. As the name implies it is a winery and they sell good wine at very competitive prices. They also offer samples!",Gary S
50,Yearly Family Tradition,"Several family members have attended the yearly Riboli Family Dinner. Great food, fine wines and excellent presentation by Dominic. He is informative, attentive and personable to guests. It's a favorite tradition and most enjoyable. The private rooms are fabulous for private parties...my birthday party was over the top (thanks to my sister's planning with staff members).",TresJolieMarie
50,Riboli Family Winemaker's Dinner,"This IS the best kept secret in town. The family dinner is a once a year event in November. It is limited to 60 guests and maintains an intimate and warm setting in the original room this historic winery began. 5 courses to please the winos and foodies alike. This years menu began with Gravlax in a horseradish cream w/micro greens followed by rosemary gnocchi in a mushroom sauce my fellow diners were literally scraping their dish to get every drop, duck leg confit, osso bucco and an almond salted caramel tart...all this with some of their best wines, including an occasional bottle of their private collection not available for sale.",Memelovesfood
40,Nice people and good wine,"We've been to San Antonio last week and it was a very nice experience. People there are lovely, we were guided by Hector, a wonderful person, he really sells happines in a bottle, impossible not to buy the wines after his kind explanation and his sharing of generous doses of happiness and joy. The winery is small, their wines are correct, some very good, but it's worse the visit. I recommend",Adriana G
40,Unique Lunch Stop near Downtown,"I unique spot for lunch and a wine tasting room with a large selection of wine for purchase. Food is good, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed. Word of caution, located in an industrial area near downtown L.A. You want to make sure you are done and leave the area prior to nightfall. No issues during the day that I know of. Good choice for a weekend lunch if you are a local.",FredInCalifornia
40,Great place for lunch!,"This was my third visit to the San Antonio Winery and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different. They have plenty of parking and the tasting room has doubled in size since the last time I was there. There are several rooms of gifts and souvenirs that will delight any visitor. It was fun just to browse too. The main reason though that people come to the winery is to eat. It is sort of a cafeteria style when ordering but then they bring you your food. I tried the meat lasagna and it was delicious! My father had the shrimp scampi and also enjoyed his plate. The plate prices range from $9 to $30 depending on what you get. They have everything from salads to sandwiches to steak. For dessert, we split a creme brûlée and it was the perfect finishing touch to our meal. And if you leave room, try a few wine tastings while you're there. They have every flavor of Stella Rosa amongst many other wines and spirits. Overall, you just can't go wrong here.",Caroline L
30,Nice atmosphere,The restaurant is really nice the room is surrounded by the massive wine caskets. Unusually you had to order your food at the counter and collect your drinks like a cafe.The food was quick to arrive and freshly cooked. The staff were helpful and friendly.We didn't have time for the complete experience of the tour or wine tasting which would have been a great end to our visit,Paul G
50,Fantastic,"Great Family outing! Great Dinner & Dessert. Not a huge selection, but enough to treat the palate. Family seating, nice Staff & really really nice ambiance",Ella811
50,A MUST!!! Ask for Hector!!!!!!,I was very happy with my visit.We were a group of 5 we did 2 tastings 1 was free which we were pleasantly surprised about. The wine was delicious and we did purchase a few cases. Hector was our server he worked for the winery for almost 40 years he was very knowledgeable not to mention fun!!! We had a Blast here!!! There is a gift shop and a restaurant I had the Chicken Ravioli delish !!!!,Lynn C
50,Hidden Treasure,"I am a big fan of Stella Rosa table wines and San Antonio Cardinale. After some research, I found the winery was in LA. It is a wonderful day trip. The wine tour was quick and informative. The wine tasting is a set menu that changes and is four tastes for $5. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable . The wine store carries some wines from partnering vineyards as well as all the labels from the Riboli family. The restaurant has wonderful dishes. It is cafeteria style, but the food is great. The lasagna was one of the best I've tasted.",guzellc
50,Great atmosphere and staff!,"From the history lesson and tour to the wine tasting to lunch, we couldn't have asked for a better afternoon. We even met a couple of members of the Riboli family (long time owners of the winery)! A must do outing if you are in downtown LA.",brandt_family
50,Ahhhh wine tasting,"Love the atmosphere when walking in. Lots of wine :) As usual, we had our dinner first, which all their main dishes are awesome. Our party of 12ish ordered a different dishes or same and we would taste a piece of someone else's meal. And their bread is awesome! We always ask for seconds and sometimes thirds for the bread! A little bit of relaxation and talking and then it's off to the wine tasting. The $5 fee to taste 4 different wines is new but that did not stop us. Long story short, our party ended up buying at least 15 bottles of wine! Want to give a big shout-out to Richard and Everett!",xkianna63x
50,Sunday wine tasting,"After a short walk from the Gold line (we missed the DASH) we had a nice relaxing afternoon of wine tasting. We did the $5 for 4 tastings and then ordered a glass of wine. We enjoyed the San Simeon label, Pinot, Cab, Riesling were my favs,",JenJen1865
50,Very amicable place to try great wines.,"This is a great place to go as a couple, you hear all about the winemaking process, and can sample a handful of great wines afterwards together!",Mauricenederland
50,Nice Experience with Arturo's Tour,"Several of us decided to go on the San Antonio Winery tour and enjoyed our experience. The tour gives information about the history of the San Antonio Winery which is quite interesting as well as a walk through both non-working and working parts of the winemaking process. It was really cool to see the giant old barrels that were used in the past and nice to see the current tools used for winemaking. While I would not say it is the most exciting tour I have ever been on in my life, Arturo did an incredible job! He was engaging and friendly and made our experience enjoyable.The tasting room gives an opportunity to try complimentary wines or a tasting of more premium selections for 15$. We chose the complimentary one which was just find and then had a bottle of wine. There are a lot of tchotchkes in the tasting room area, way too many, for sale (t-shirts, gifts, etc.) It is a bit cluttered and overwhelming. Otherwise, it is a nice space to visit.",GlendaleCA
50,"Fun, inexpensive, and informative","The staff at San Antonio winery is informative and friendly. When you go in you see a long counter with about six pourers, all of whom can answer your questions and suggest wines to suit your taste. Kat, my server was very pleasant and helpful. The winery offers four tastings for five dollars and give you choices as to which wines you want to drink. The wines vary from fairly sweet whites such as Reisling to full-bodied reds such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. The restaurant in the winery has good Italian food, which is reasonably priced. I had a delicious manicotti which I couldn't finish, and my friend had A gigantic piece of lasagna.",Barklie E
50,Find Clifton - He will make your Day!,My husband and I love wine and have planned trips around the globe to taste it. Obviously that was not the focus of our trip to LA but when we saw the flyer we thought we should go. With our 21 year old daughter it would be her first wine tasting opportunity with us too. We were going to include lunch too. What a fun place. I have to say it was all about the staff. It was obvious they were all having fun - joking with the customers and each other. We had a bored 10 year old with us and Clifton kept including her in the conversation. He was a delight.When we went to get the food we were surprised by the cafeteria style but were short for time so decided to try it. Was one of our best meals in LA. Even the ten year old who is picky LOVED her chicken ravioli.,PatriciaTravelTil100
50,No need to drive to Napa Valley,"We had a great time, wine tasting, sumptuous lunch and great ambiance, live music even... Highly recommended to go to when in Los Angeles,",FLORIAN M0
40,Wine!,I prefer this location in comparison to the Ontario one because it is much larger but both are great. There are tons of wines to choose from and lots of great samples to try. I always find something I must have in the gift shop area.,bhurt22
50,Funtastic Place for a Date!,"This was my first time here, mainly because I had not idea this place was even here. I was shocked to hear that there was a winery so close to downtown LA, so naturally I was skeptical!While this place is not a winery in the sense that there are no grapes being grown or harvested at this location, they do ferment the wine, age it in cedar barrels, and finally bottle on site. The free to tour of the place lets you see the whole operation from the fermenting room to the wine cellars to the bottling plant.This place has been here since the early 19th century so it has an old world charm to it. It of course has gone through some renovations and additions to the building, the most major of which happened in the 1980s. They now have a restaurant, and a store front.The store front has a great selections of their wines made on the primes, plus other wines made by them in California and Italy. They also have a nice selection of hard liquors and spirits from many regions of the world. I am so happy to found this place because I will definitely be making a trip out here again.",David S
50,Great for the family & you'll feel right at home,"My family and I celebrated my high school graduation by having lunch here at San Antonio Winery (Los Angeles), and we all had an unforgettable experience. From the food to the people to the design of the place itself, this place is great across all boards. It's also wonderful for kids, as my nine year old brother evidently enjoyed the food and the gift shop.San Antonio Winery exudes a homey ambiance that will make you feel right at home, which is emphasized by the friendly staff (who gladly offered to take our group photo).Meeting Mr. Santo, a member of the founding family who also gave us a highly informative tour, was the highlight of our visit. Personable and charming, he ensures that everyone has a great time there at the winery.So I leave with three things that make San Antonio unforgettable:1. Great food and drinks2. A homey ambiance3. Wonderful people",ReinaRose
50,Surprisingly Informative and Interesting Tour,"Who would have thought that there was such a productive winery in the heart of the industrial area in downtown LA? The free tour was quite informative and conducted by a knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide. The bottling line was not operating when we visited on the Sunday afternoon, but that did not materially detract from the substance of the tour itself.In contrast, the tasting room was a bit crowded and the ambiance and atmosphere was commercial and retail oriented. In contact to other tasting rooms, this projected a focus on retail sales rather than on the wine being featured. No matter, however. The location was very convenient for a quick something-to-do on a lazy Sunday afternoon.There was a restaurant on the precession but we did not sample it on this visit.Considering the location, I am considering following up with a call later this week to explore using the location and facilities for a possible corporate event venue.",JoshPhD
50,What Great Fun!,"We started our visit with a fascinating and educational (free) tour conducted by one of the owners.The history of the winery was worth the trip. We then the moved on to the wine tasting area where we were very impressed by the knowledge of the servers, as well as the tremendous quality wines that sell themselves as you sample them. We never realized some of our favorite wines are produced by the San Antonio winery family. (They still produce wines in Italy as well as the U.S.) We then ate in the restaurant which was somewhat cafeteria style, but you order your food and they bring it to your table. However, the food was much better than cafeteria food; I had a grilled Salmon salad that was top quality, and every bit as good as any I have eaten in an upscale restaurant without the high price and dress code. My wife had the quiche and salad which she said was excellent. We finished our San Antonio Winery experience with a creamy Tiramisu and coffee, and a little shopping in the store. The winery is only 1 1/2 miles from Union Station, and a cab ride will set you back about $10.00 with a tip. We then rode the Metro-link home to give the wine time to wear off before driving. This was a great experience, and we will be encouraging all of our friends to come with us next time.",James G
50,A fantastic find in the city,"I went to the San Antonio Winery on a Saturday with family members. We did the wine tasting and found some exceptionally good wines. We then had lunch in the restaurant, which was very reasonably priced. We shared an antipasto platter with French bread and a fantastic peach wine, all for around $30. This is a destination I highly recommend and would definitely go to again.",Karen P
50,We have been going there since 1980,Tucked in the back of an industrial area of Downtown Los Angeles (Not far from Olvera Street and Union Station). San Antonio winery has been a regular stop for us when we are in the area. They have an Italian restaurant that is very good (have often seen LA Dodgers baseball players and Hollywood notables here). They have a great gift shop and they have gift boxes and baskets that make great gifts. Worth a stop if you are in the area.,csarchibald

We waited a few minutes for the wine tour and was assisted by a very informative employee that gave the two of us a very personal and up close look at the wine making process.

The food is Northern Italian cuisine and simply fantastic. The service is very gentile and fabulous. The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautifully decorated oak wine barrels. They offer a very nice selection of Pasta, Salads, Sandwiches Desserts, and more. Stay for the fascinating Winery tour held on the hour and wine tasting afterward. This is a great gem near the center of Downtown LA. Buon Appetito.",Mark L
50,A Los Angeles Institution,"A lovely place, especially around Christmas time. Whether you go there for snacks or a full meal the place serves great food. Not only that, they have the best wine in Southern California. If you don't like wine try their beers, but their Sangria is the best. It is decorated for the holidays. I just went there for a private event but the regular dining room, decorated for the holidays and looking like a winery is really charming. After dinner peruse the items for sale..cheese, sauces, and of course all kind is wine. The service is friendly, efficient, and makes you feel at home. Parking this time of year is problematic but keep circling, it's worth it.",Skyros7
50,Very interesting,Had never been to a winery and we checked this one out while in LA. What a great experience. The tour is free. Our tour guide was great and knowledgable. This winery produces the Stella Rosa brand amongst others. They also told us that they produce wine for the churches. Very interning. You have a free wine tasting also. It does have a restaurant attached to it. Great place to see while in LA.,Julia D
50,"Great Wine, Great Food, Free Tours","First of all this is totally a spot that you want to make a day of. Go there and enjoy the free hour tour of the historical venue and the owners. Then end with a complimentary wine tasting. They have some of the best to taste from I might add. My fav is the stella rosa orange sparkling moscato. Then make your way to the restaurant. I would make reservations it has always been crowded on all my trips there. You can choose from many different selections in a cafeteria type of style. Almost reminds me of the historic clifton's downtown. I heard that on some days they play jazz as well. Perfect for a date, a company lunch, holiday party or even a reception of some sorts! Def recommend you going there!",Niketa C
50,Wonderful service!,"The Service: The Wine Shop Manager, Dominic, is FANTASTIC!! He has great personality. Wonderful customer service!! He is super knowledgeable and informative. He gave our group private wine tasting and winery tour. We had a blast!!The Wine Tasting: $5 wine tasting. Can't beat that price!! Dominic chose great selection of wine. He separated our group into ""sweet"" & ""dry"". So we all could get to try the selection of wines that fit our preference.The Winery Tour: This winery started in 1917.... two more years it is going to be 100 years anniversary. I hope they are going to do a big celebration! Dominic is such a great tour guide, he knows the history so well. We learn so much about wine!The Parking: They have their own private parking lot. If the lot is full, lots of street parking (free).This winery is hidden in the industrial area. Huge space.... wine tasting room, retail portion (wine, snacks, accessories, etc). They also have a restaurant, private party rooms, wine classes, etc. And yes, they are in Los Angeles!! No need to drive up north for good wine anymore!!! Love it~",ILoveFoodComa
50,Best place to buy wine and have lunch.,"My wife loves Stella Rosa Russo and this is the place that offers them by the cases at a below the retail price. Lately the new wine called ""Platinum"" was just released and this is phenomenal much better than Stella Black. I bought 6 bottles. The restaurant is also great for taking my visitors for lunch. What is great about this place is the winery tour and the information on the wines they make, in addition to the free wine tasting of three wines. I recently brought my immigrant cousin here to see the winery. Parking is but avoid lunch time as it gets crowded and limited space. Lunch order tend to be a bit pricy but affordable for the location and ambiance.",butchrey

40,A Jewel in the Midst,"While taking care of business downtown, my son and I decided we were hungry. He suggest the San Antonia Winery. I'm game, some place new for me. Upon arrival I notice the 'Stella Rose' brand, I have seen this on bill-boards though out the city, I did not know the winery was right here in LA, just north of downtown. Winery offers 3 free taste testing. I was surprise by the selection of non-alcoholic beverages.I picked a peach non alcoholic to take home and have with lunch. The restaurant was nice... Had to be creative for a non meat meal. The workers were very accommodating and attentive.",ANOINTEDDANCE
40,"Good food, excellent wines","We tasted several wine then went for late lunch. I had a seared ahi tuna salad and Terry had chicken Marcella. Both were very very good. It is served sort of cafeteria style, in that you order and pay at the counter, they take your tray to a table. Of course wine is available. A sign at your table indicates what you are eating, then another waiter brings your entree when it is prepared. It was pleasant, the ambiance was nice and they didn't rush us.",Linda Sue N
50,Worth every minute,"This place is the gem of LA. Los Angeles is known for its sports and it's nightlife, but this place should be considered along with it. Amazing selection of wine with a great wait staff to help with your selection. I'd recommend it to any wine lover.",Mary W

We missed the crowds and we had the leisure of walking through and taking our time shopping, eating, and wine tasting.

I also would love to take their free tour offered each hour.",Angie M
40,Nice!,The food here is good and very reasonable. The staff were very insightful to helping you make the right choice on the wines you chose to drink. A hidden jewel in the heart of Los Angeles.,Riz213
50,We love this place,"We live in Orange County which is maybe 30 miles from the San Antonio Winery. Of course, on Southern California freeways those 30 miles could take 2 hours to cover.But the San Antonio Winery is worth it.We have been going there for years. The tasting bar offers 3 or 5 tastes for free, but I have never seen them stop pouring. There is a huge selection of wines -- many from San Antonio's numerous Central California vineyards and many imported.We absolutely love the restaurant. There's no menu -- all the dishes are presented on the plates and covered with plastic wrap on tables as you enter. The prices are good and the variety is incredible.I usually get spaghetti with sausage, but the salads and sandwiches are delicious as well. They have steaks, lamp chops, you name it.You order and they give you your bread and salad on a tray which you push along. At the end and the waiter takes your food to the table and, later, brings the entree.Order a bottle of wine and maybe a piece of carrot cake and a latte for desert and you have a relaxing meal that can stretch for an hour and a half. The restaurant is always busy.The nice meal puts you in the mood to buy some wine on the way out.Enjoy.(There's a free winery tour available).",Tom078
50,Great wine experience in LA!,"Loved visiting this family owned winery. Free tasting, up to 3 wines; friendly knowledgeable people pouring wine. All staff very welcoming and friendly. Arrived not too long after the 11am opening on a Saturday to avoid potential crowds. There is a convenient, adjacent parking lot, very nice tasting room and fabulous gift shop! Took the wine tour with great access to their ""back room"". Tom was an excellent guide. Understandably, it was a bit cold during the tour and I wish I had brought a sweater! Had the opportunity to meet family members, Santo and Dominic, as we were leaving the winery. Spent some time chatting with them before heading back to our car. Enjoyed the visit and would certainly return again!",Cleomissy
50,Great customer service and food,We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Everyone was so very nice. I love how they had no paper menus but all the food displayed at the door. You could see exactly how the presentation of food was. It's like upscale cafeteria style service. The restaurant was beautiful with barrels of wine displayed and different rooms names with vineyard themes. We finished with a twine tasting. Our wine guy runs this part of store. He was super nice and the wine is awesome,Felicia S

50,Definite must do in LA!,We went on a Saturday at about 11:30 and it wasnt crowded yet... we had some time before the 12:00 wine tour so we went to the bar.. Wesley was so friendly and he knew every wine we asked about in great detail.. The tour was very entertaining- you see the tanks and barrels and the facilities that they have for private events (there was a bach party and a wedding happening that day) were really nice.. we returned to Wesley after the tour and the space was very crowded. (until the next tour) we ended up with about 9 bottles of wine - they have a huge selection with the Stella Rosa brand -but their brand I must say is better :). My parents did talk to one of the owners and were amazed that he would take the time to talk to them.. would def. be back - maybe next time try the restaurant...,k176

40,Saturday afternoon Wine Tasting and Tour,"We have been to the location in Paso Robles, but we wanted to try the downtown Los Angeles location since it was closer to our home. We arrived at this location around 2:00Pm. They have free parking. It was crowded, but we found an empty counter space and Dominic greeted us right away. They have free wine tastings and free tours of the the facility. They also have other tastings that you can buy. Dominic had us try several different wines. We ended up buying 3 bottles of wine and met a few nice people while we were tasting. We also did the tour, which was very informative and maybe about 30 minutes. I learned some new things that i had not heard before from other tours we have gone on.The tasting is in their store,which also includes a gift shop area and a small area where you can buy food to munch on (cheese, crackers, pastries). They have some tables inside and outside where you can relax and sip on your wine. If you are a beer drinker, they also sell beer. Then they have a restaurant in the back with a bigger menu. We tried the steak sandwich and a salad. It was good! I would go back again because there were a few other items on their menu that I would like to try. Also on this particular Saturday they had a gentleman playing jazz music in the background in the restaurant.",rcrook21
40,Surprisingly unexpected!,"I honestly thought this winery sits somewhere in Napa Valley. It's right in the middle of Los Angeles! This winery will celebrate it's 100 years in 2017 (if my memory serves me right). During our visit, we actually saw the fourth generation owner while we were touring the winery. But before that, we had a good authentic Italian meal served fresh and hot! It was very delish! Unfortunately, there's this one female employee stationed at the counter serving drinks at the time of our visit who was extremely rude. Actually, I felt racially offended when she served the drink I didn't order. I think someone before me ordered the wrong drink and that lady served it to me instead so she won't have to get another glass. But I found out that my friend had a similar experience of rudeness while eating our meal. However, when I complained about her attitude, the other server was quick to rectify. That being said, the trip was still very much worth it! You will enjoy their discounted wines and good cheese :)",thefabtrav
40,Pleasant visit,"We visited the Ontario Location to sample the wine since we actually live close to San Antonio, Texas! Great wines and employees are very knowledgeable about the products.Purchased several bottles and they were packaged in styrofoam bottle holders and boxed! We were able to check this onto the plane and they arrived safe and sound! But caution, they told us they ship like this using FEDEX so assumed the airlines would accept them. Only if in a baggy to contain spills so make sure they put in a baggie also before wrapping. Luckily, I had put them in an insulated tote with handles so they accepted them to be checked as baggage.",Roberta D
50,Wine tasting,"Great place to try some very good reasonable prices wines. They also have a few of the high end wines like Myacamus, Opus 1 etc. Our favorite was the Opaque Zinfindale. $30.00 and worth it.",Brant D
50,San Antonio Winery Ontario - AWESOME STAFF and Location!,"It was a Saturday morning and I was just waking up at a hotel in Ontario, CA after a fun evening and Heart concert at the LA County Fair, and as usual, I was searching for local adventure. The hotel guidebook mentioned the San Antonio winery and I thought to myself, ""wine tasting at 11am on a Saturday? Sure!! Why not?"" So off I went to check out one of LA's oldest wineries.I lucked out and was assisted by such a sweet, helpful and knowledgable girl (wish I knew her name!) who was so great to talk to. She filled me in on some of the incredibly robust history of the San Antonio Winery and the part it played in Los Angeles history.Founded in 1917 by a hard working Northern Italian immigrant, Santo Cambianica who made his way to Los Angeles to discover the American Dream. While most all other area wineries were forced to close as a result of Prohibition and the Great Depression, thanks to his strong ties to the Catholic Church, Santo's winery actually flourished as it was granted permission to make wines for the Catholic Church (sacramental purposes only of course! Ha!) See? It really does pay to be a good Catholic!After Santo passed away in 1956, his nephew Stefano and wife Maddalena carried on the San Antonio Winery tradition and even expanded their ownership of vineyard lands. Fast forward to today, and this winery is still standing in the original location on Lamar Street in downtown LA as well as locations in Ontario and Paso Robles. Note to self: get downtown to see the original winery!The Ontario location, however, is a BUSTLING business with wine tastings, wine retail store and gift shop. A plethora of historical photos line the walls and their personable staff is there to help guide you through the decision making process of which wine(s) to take home with you that day.I love the history and passion behind the making of wine. It's so much more than a glass of crushed grapes. Although, if done right, those crushed grapes do taste oh so yummy! What a great place to visit any time you are in the area!",Sally M
50,Super- San Antonio Winery,"With friends visiting from Canada, we chose unique LA activities. We enjoyed selecting 3 free healthy sized tastings per person and ordered lunch through a café line carrying our salads and bread, while a waiter brought us our yummy entrees (2 salmon, chicken 2 parmagiana). Then we shopped a bit, enjoyed another set of tastings and took the winery tour. Beyond winemaking and bottling, the tour explained the history of the area and the history of wineries in LA.You might combine this activity with museum row - just a few miles to the west on Wilshire.As our timing was over New Years weekend, we went to see the Rose Bowl Parade floats in Pasadena and then a short hop to the winery.Cheers!",805barbaraj
40,Interesting Locatin,Not sure I would drive out of my way to visit this location. Had lunch here today and enjoyed it very much. Its in an industrial part of of LA I always turn before I get to the parking lot so follow the signs. You stand in line to order food but they carry it to your table. Very clean the food was above average.,HowieEmbry
50,an la gem!,"although located in an industrial area of LA, this family owned (yes the 94 yr old owners still visit the shop every day) has an amazing selection of wines, and the restaurant offers a wide variety of valued priced meals (of course wine is extra but it is reasonable) ..A must see when touring LA.",jackpine2
50,You Have To See It To Believe It!!!,"If someone had told me that a historic winery was nestled next to ChinaTown in LA...I would tell them they had finished one bottle too many! Yet the San Antonio Winery (Family owned and operated for four generations) is a contradiction in so many ways. I read the negative reviews of the winery, but decided that I would make the decision for myself. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID!!!Living in the South you have many winery tours that end in a specific ""room"" where you are given a flight of selected vintages. They do things differently here...Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, can come up to the tasting area and get three tastes. This makes the area seem crowded and often noisy. What it does, in my mind, is allow those who may not be brave enough to try something different...to try something different! We also took the tour of the facility. This was without question the most educational, inspirational, informational, and FUN event in LA. It is heartwarming to see the dreams of an individual be lived out in the day to day work of four generations of family.The restaurant was very clever. Unlike some who commented that the cafeteria system was a turn off...I was this as one of the only ways to efficiently service as many people as they do. The quality of our food (Ahi Tuna Salad, and the Tuna Melt) was outstanding. A glass of wine with lunch made it even better! The item I appreciated most was the guitarist that played LIVE throughout the meal.As I have said of many attractions reviewed on Trip Advisor...You have to experience some things for yourself!!!!",DrM225
40,SAN ANTONIO WINERY-ONTARIO LOCATION,"Driving up the 15 going north , we noticed some traffic and curious to see what was around. San Antonio Winery.After clicking on it, and seeing it had food as well. We were a bit bummed to discover that is only at the LA location. Still we strolled around and suprised to discover the winery labels over 10+ wines under various labels.To our delight the chance to sample a few choices complimentary and or option to purchase a premium selection of tastings. we chose rather just sample the complimentary choices.I leaned heavily towards the Ports, while my date sampled the Pinot and Cabernet.The friendliness of Terri was great, walking us through the various choices, characters of the wines enjoyed. Kudos to her for such wonderful personalized service.I purchased a bottle of the port, and if passing through and traffic gets thick, will know where to pull off and rest for awhile. Though no restaurant is on site, snacks are abundent in the shop and Next door is a delicious Mexican restaurant Jaunchos.",Stuart F
40,Urban Winery in the heart of Los Angeles,"The only one to have survived the hundreds of wineries which were located here. Delicious lunch which consisted of Linguini Scampi, Shrimp Salad, soup, and Tarragon Chicken Sandwich. Allguests were happy. Gracious staff, festive atmosphere. Will return to try the wine tasting, explore the wines on sale and to take the tour. Familiar with the Paso Robles location.",Kay O
40,If you love sweet wines you must stop here,"Holy crap this place has 3 free complimentary tastings.If you are a lightweight like me you will feel the buzz quickly.Lots of sweet wines to sample. This place is crowded but there are a good number of servers to assist you. I ended up purchasing 9 bottles, yes I will be seeing you again San Antonio Winery!Don't forget to tip your server.",MrsBrandt
50,"Food, Wine, and tour",This is a hidden gem inside city of Los Angeles. We came here to celebrate a birthday. Food is cafeteria style. All items are displayed in a large table. Our party has chicken marsala and Beef of the Day. They were both fantastic. We went Sunday noon and it has live music. We missed the tour every hour on the hour. We will definitely go back.,francesychen
40,Strange but interesting location,The wine shop is big and holds a wide selection of wine. The staff at the counter was very helpful and knowledgeable.I appreciate the visit there but I just find it strange that its location is somewhere that looks like an industrial/factory zone. I guess I had a different perception of a winery.,Elaine C
40,Very good,"They have ample parking. It is an old winery which lives up to it's name. If you are into wine, this is the place.",john r
50,Royal Treatment,"We visited for an office birthday party. The restaurant had a pre-order variety menu for our group. We chose a salad and sandwich menu - made our lunch for 18 people fast and efficient.When we arrived, we were shown a table with the actual food items prepared and wrapped in plastic so we could see what we would acutally order - it all looked great ! And the best part - it tasted great as well.The dining area is beautifully decorated. We had a wine barrel wall behind our seating, All the ladies were escorted to their tables, chairs pulled out for them. The wait staff was friendly and available for refills, etc.We also did the tour...interesting and personable. They make some of the wine there...some from their grapes, some grapes they buy. This place is HUGE with an enormous variety of wine to purchase. They have many other wine related items to purchase as well. Fun gift store!Weird location in an industrial area but worth the trip is you are love wine ! And a good lunch with ambience !",Off2SeeItAll
50,Hidden gem in DTLA!,I absolutely love this place. I've been coming here since 2007 and rave about it to friends and co-workers. The free tours and tastings are awesome and the food is delicious. I love the ambiance of the restaurant and that the prices are very reasonable. This is a great excursion for friends but it's also a perfect setting for a date night.,Jennifer
40,A Tour and Some Wine,"We went on the San Antonio Winery Tour and Testing with friends from L.A. that had lived in L.A. their whole lives and had never gone. It was fun, a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. They give tours on the hour. Luckily we got there right at 1:00 and went on the tour. One of our group is in a wheelchair, but it was not a problem. Wesley gave us our tour and he made our day. Since they don't grow grapes in L.A. anymore, they just process and bottle the wine here. The tour was interesting especially if you have not been on a wine tour before. It wasn't very long but Wesley let us ask questions about everything.When you walk in, there is a huge bar and salespeople behind it to give you three free wine tastings. We went on the tour first which I think is a good idea. When we came back we spent some time browsing the gift shop and then noticed that Wesley was behind the bar. The seven of us went to his area and started tasting. Wesley made the day - - he was funny, he had great suggestions, he took wonderful pictures - he is a true salesman......but when I go back, I am going to look for him.",DonandMaro
40,Short stop at the Winery.,"We had a short stop at the winery for lunch during a bus tour for the Rose Parade. The lunch was very good and the service was great. The gift shop was huge with tons of wine and accessories available. They even ship for you. Didn't tour the winery part. Not wine drinkers so not to interested. Overall, the food was great but I can't help you much with the tour.",scratchgolfer19
30,Decent way to pass some time,"As another reviewer mentioned, this wasn't exactly what I expected from the oldest winery in CA. It does feature a lot of wines produced by the various wineries they own through out the state. You can taste many of them for free. The guy who helped us found out what style of wine we prefer & offered us tastings he thought we'd like. It's a busy place and is more like a wine store, but we got to taste some things that were new to us and it was an easy way to spend some time. We also had a light lunch in the restaurant there (Maddelena).",mommyinmotion
30,Winery - Store,"If you are thinking you are visiting a winery with this stop, it is not. It is basically a wine store with a lot of external wines, not only those produced by San Antonio Winery. Also the wines are pretty pricy. They do offering tasting for their own wines, however, we were basically neglected at the tasting counter in favor of folks who came in to purchase other products. With all of the wonderful, true wineries in Temecula, it is best to skip this stop and just head over there.",J T
50,Free wine-tasting (and a free winery tour!) in downtown Los Angeles,"What a wonderful wine-tasting experience we had today! It was a great girls' day out for sure. Our wine server Robert obviously passionate, smart and knowledgable about the wines he poured for us, his dry wit and humor (not to mention his good looks) put us all in such a great mood that we ended up buying well over a case of wine between the four of us. We also took the winery tour and learned about winemaking from Hector (hard to believe he's been working there 38 years!). Also enjoyed the lunch with live music in the background and browsing in the gift store which would be an excellent place for last minute holiday gifts: really cute stuff! Given that the wine-tasting was free, as well as the tour, one could really say that the historic San Antonio Winery is a hidden gem of Los Angeles. Prost!",Itzi B
40,Nice Place,"This place was pretty decent. The free wine tasting was great and free tour very informative. After the first visit and horrible customer service, the manager did an ok job of remedying the situation after being alerted. The place was crowded when I went - both times! Seems to be very popular. There seems to be a large selection if various wines. The location may throw you off at first but once arriving, it's fairly nice inside and out. There's a restaurant attached but I did not visit. The wine tasting (3 samples) was a nice experience and the tour of the winery was cool. The tour guide was very informative. The food and snacks are expensive! A tiny cheese and cracker plate was about $7. Overall, a good place that I'd be willing to visit again.",jerz609
50,Winery in downtown LA a great place to visit and taste!,"San Antonio Winery is a great day trip attraction for Los Angeles locals and visitors alike. It's a family run business over 100 years old, and though the location is in a somewhat seedy part of downtown L.A. (what isn't?) the place itself is classy and well-cared-for. You can get a complimentary tasting, but we went for the 'deluxe' tasting so we could try more of the wines. There is a huge upgrade in quality when you sample the ones which are grown (and bottled) in Paso Robles. Not only that, but they are an excellent value as well. Both the white and red were big hits with our group and we would definitely all go back again. After our tasting we had lunch right there, and though the ambiance is somewhat lacking, since the whole 'deli' setup is right in the huge building the tastings are in, the food was excellent and everyone was pleased with the quality and flavor. Overall, highly recommended!",Greg S
50,"Tasty, fun and unexpected","We were looking for the San Antonio Winery in downtown Los Angeles after having been to the wineries in the Santa Barbara area. We found ourselves in an unlikely spot for this - an industrial park. Only the murals of vines gave it away. When the door opened, the sight of lit barrels and a beautiful wine tasting room stunned us. Not only do they not charge for the wine but they offer a tour and have an extensive gift shop and restaurant as well. Everything was delicious and added to a perfect wine experience. Don't let the surroundings put you off. Once inside you will be carried away. And thee is free parking right across the street.",ViviColumbiaMaryland
50,A Great Place to take your Guests!,"I always take my out of town guests here! It has been here forever, the people are nice, they comp you 3 wine tastings, and the restaurant is very good! I have never done the tour, we just sample & eat lunch & everyone has a Great time!",Avocado-gal
30,too commercialized to quote my Father In Law,"I live in LA this was another attraction my In-laws wanted to visit. I was surprised by location, in a pretty deserted area. Large scale wine store, if you want to purchase wine lots of variety. Went for the tour it was a mere 15 minutes, plus we had a group of ladies who talked through the whole tour, so we did not hear the tour guide much and he was clearly annoyed. Went to the tasting bar 3 free tastes...I liked the ones I tried, I did all whites a pinot grigio and a sauvignon blanc and prosecco. My husband , In-Laws and friend did reds and were seriously not impressed. I ended up purchasing a strawberry infused sparling wine from South America. Did not dine at the restaurant so cannot comment. My Father-In-Law was very dissapointed...",Chewtoy33
30,great deals on wine.,I come here a few times a year to pick up wine in bulk. great deals here. I have never ate at the restaurant. I am dying to try it. I have heard great things about it.,toshinacrockett
40,Has a great feel you are not in Downtown LA.,I Had lunch there on a Sunday with my BF. I had the spinach ravioli with the San Simeon Caberet and my friend had the tequila chicken. I loved my meal but my friend didn't care so much for her food. The wine was ok but the place was great and you do feel your out of the city. Would I return? Yes I would.,Coconuts4
40,"LA,s own winery",We usually go to the winery on a sunday afternoon with one or two other couples. First stop is at the wine counter to get our three free samples. Always a pleasant atmosphere and very friendly and knowledgeable servers. If there is something you want to buy they will take care of your purchase and hold it till you are ready to leave. We now go to eat at the restaurant which has samples of what they are serving put out on display. Anything from pastas to sandwiches is available for purchase. You pick out what you want and it is brought to your table. We are usually at our table for close to an hour and there is never a rush to get us to leave. Lots of atmosphere letting you know you are in a winery which in it self is very strange to be in Los Angelas,Charlie V
50,Terrific experience...,"What a great day. The San Antonio Winery is a wonderful place to get away from the suburbs and get into the city. The winery is immaculate and restaurant is very good and the service is wonderful. The best part of the visit was the owners hand-on welcome and friendly conversation. His love of family and knowledge regarding the history of the area was fascinating to our group. The gift/wine shop is lovely, displayed beautifully and great prices. Thank you Santo for making our day special.",patdileva3
50,Best lunch place in downtown LA!,"Love this winery in the middle of no where in LA,the lunch is good too with music in the middle of week in the middle of downtown commercial district,the area is commercial but don't miss it if you are traveling to downtown LA for business,work or study.It's nice place to see and experience if you visit LA,I highly recommend it if you drive around that area.",KhatM
50,Great fun for ALL,"This venue combines so many concepts into one property. A wine/liquor store, a restaurant, a catering hall for receptions, and the winery complete with a tour from very knowledgeable staff. I have frequented many vineyards and learned a lot, but this tour taught me things I never knew. Its history and transformation throughout the years can be seen even by speaking with one of the founders who still works full time at 90 years old. His wife runs the restaurant named after her, Magdalena's. I highly recommend this when you think you've seen it all in Los Angeles. What a great treat in the middle of Downtown, LA",clfigueroa18
30,Average,"San Anotonio Winery is a place you have to go to atleast once if you live in L.A. The wine room is pretty good, the restaurant is pretty boring. First time I came to the winery was back in the 70's, been a few times since and things haven't changed much. The food is bleh. Only reason I would go again is if someone wanted to go their, I wouldn't go by my own free will.",Ninachka1
40,Nice Getaway,Anytime you have free time to do a meal away from home you and your mate go to the San Antonio Winery. You can have a meal and have a good time wine tasting. If you are a wine lover this is the place to be.,Yolanda M
50,Very worthwhile,Very good wine a tucked away location and great ambiance... .. good service and good food... plus a tour of the winery,562belmont

50,"Terrific spot for a business lunch. Great food, great service.","Surprisingly convenient location. Free ample parking. Casual atmosphere in a beautiful room. Genuinely nice staff and delicious food, super reasonable pricing and nice portions. What a find!I understand they also give wine tastings and winery tours. Haven't yet done that.",R S
50,Five stars!!!,"Great little place.Very cute,would definitely go.Little unexpected at the heart of L.A downtown.great looking and tasting wines.defineatly a top note...very nice.",Tayfuns
50,Who knew there was a winery in the heart of LA!,"On our journey into the LA Valley we saw billboards for the San Antonio Winery so I looked it up and saw that it was located in the heart of LA near downtown. We decided to take a look, of course our expecations low.We were pleasantly suprized to find this cute, historial winery in the heart of LA blocks away from Chinatown. Upon entering the faciltity you see a cute gift shop with typical wine gifts, then if you continue on you see their cafeteria style restaurant and then the tasting room The tasting room is nicely set up. They allow you to chose any three from their normal wines to taste free of charge. If you want their premium stuff its $10 but you get to keep the glass.We ended up opting for the free samples and my husband and I chose different ones so we would have a little taste of more. We ended up buying three then wanted to try one more. The wine clerk offered us an additional taste from the premium wines and we ended up buying the bottle. They gave us a discount also, I'm guessing because we were buying more than just one. They also offer free winery tours, but we did not stay for one.The winery is no Napa, but, its a historical landmark and the wine really is not bad.Should our journeys take us to LA again we will sure be back!",JENSAVERINO
10,The McDonald's of Wineries,"This place is terrible. It has no organization, the staff is rude and the dining is the equivalent of a cafeteria. While waiting over 30 minutes for the ""restaurant"" I heard the staff complaining about their customers in front of other customers. They also complained about how busy it was and how they were never going to ""get out of here"". Instead of a restaurant like any other winery I have been to you choose what you want from a display on a table. A checker then takes your order and barks it to the short order cooks. There is no personalization you get what they give you. You then sit in the ""dining room"" which is loud with soft rock music playing so loudly you cannot have a conversation. I was going to go to the tasting room, but they shut down and 7 pm and kicked everyone out. This place has no class and I would never go back.",UPGlobeTrotter
50,Something nice and different to do in LA,"My husband and I just went last weekend to the San Antonio winery and had a lovely time. I had read the reviews on Trip advisor looking for things to do in LA, other than the tipical Hollywod walk of fame...and we were surprised to find a winery in the city (my husband lived in LA for 10 years and didn't know about it).The tour itself isn't very long, but it's fun and we learned a lot from the tour guide ""Craig"", who was very nice and knowledgeable.We got to try several wines and never felt pressure to purchase.Looking back at our trip to LA, the Sna Antonio Winery was definitely a highlight.",thsweetlife123
50,Great Little Winery,"While in LA last week, my husband and I stopped in at the San Antonio winery and we were very impressed by it. While it’s located in the downtown area, it’s more off the beaten bath – in more of the industry area. That was fine by us b/c we had plenty of parking and it was pretty easy to find.We did a wine sampling with one of the nicest gentleman. He let us sample about six different wines and we ended up buying two bottles that were reasonably priced. And the only reason we didn’t buy more was because we had to fly with it. They had such a wide variety of wines, not to mention sweet fruity wines and sakes. I was also happy to hear that they sell some of their brands at a store down the road from us at home.The winery also had a restaurant at the LA Site that looked very nice and we also thought the menu looked nice. A definite to try if we’re ever back in the area.",JenniferLynn
50,WINE TASTING IN LA - San Antonio Winery,"Who knew that there is a ""diamond in the rough,"" and an ""oasis"" in the outskirts of downtown Los Angeles. Just a ""hope, skip & a jump"" from Union Station is a wine tasting room and restaurant called San Antonio Winery. Bonus! Just like the old days, free wine tasting or you can choose, for a minimal price, to upgrade your tasting and keep the logo glass. We had a marvelous time with a friendly wine server, Christopher, learning about the history of the winery and their wines. The gift shop sold cute, seasonal items. But it was the restaurant that turned out to be a terrific surprise! For a very fair price, you can choose from a variety of gourmet selections, buy a bottle of their wine, and sit near their aging room to enjoy the food and drink. The real thrill, however, was meeting an employee who has been working for San Antonio for 35 years! And, we met the owner who, even though is in his 80's, was there behind the wine bar answering the phone and informing guests of the finer points about wine. Wow - impressive. If you like to wine taste, don't miss this opportunity to try San Antonio Winery in Los Angeles.",Cyn11
50,The Maddalena Restaurant at the San Antonio Winery,"Family-owned winery for almost a century. The Maddalena Restaurant within is of course run by the beautiful Maddelena, the matriarch of the family. See her portrait in the wineshop. Semi cafeteria style service. Several salad, sandwich, and pasta dishes can be selected; the waiters bring them to your tables. Friendly atmosphere. Sometimes music. Beautiful dining area. Wine tasting in the gift shop. Fun tourist place to L.A.",Rosquete
50,A highlight in Los Angeles,"One of the highlights of our recent trip to the Los Angeles area was the San Antonio Winery. We happened to be there on New Year's Eve day, one of their very busiest days of the year. We had lunch at the winery's Maddalena Restaurant and it was delicious. We had a party of six and everyone was very happy with their meal. The restaurant is a combination of cafeteria style with a fine dining environment. The meals available for that day are displayed when you come in. Once you choose your meal and beverage (glasses of wine are right there for the taking), you sit down at your table. The restaurant is beautiful and it looks like you are in a huge barrel, appropriate for a winery. There was live music when we were there and that added to the ambience. The bread was to die for and the food, as I said, was very good. Go to their website www.sanantoniowinery.com and look at the pictures.Our group was from Minnesota and we were really looking forward to taking a tour of the winery. We were told that it was too busy and there were no tours, which was understandable. The owner, Santo Riboli, heard we were disappointed and took it upon himself to make sure we had a short, private tour and also took us in the back for a private wine tasting of five different wines. That's what I call going above and beyond, especially on such a busy day for their winery! We couldn't have been more impressed. Santo went out of his way to make sure we were happy and having fun although he had a million other things to do. Go to the San Antonio winery and tell Santo the girls from Minnesota sent you!! Have lunch and buy some wine...you won't be sorry!",Lifes2short4me
50,Wonderful romantic hideaway,"My significant other and I went to this LA hideaway during a romantic weekend and were thoroughly impressed.Start with lunch (they don't serve dinner because they believe their staff should be able to eat dinner with their own families) at the Magdalena restaurant. Although you choose your meal cafeteria style, it is then freshly prepared and brought to your table. I had the gnocci, my boyfriend had the eggplant parmesean, and we shared a chocolate mousse for desert. All meals come with salad or soup and bread as well. We each enjoyed wine with our meal, which totaled abou $50. The setting is very romantic, with dim lighting and authentic wine casks lining the room.Then, move onto the winery tour which is offered every hour on the hour. You will get the chance to learn about some little known LA history and get a first hand glimpse of what winemaking is like. If you go during the week, you also get to see the wine-mixers, bottlers, and labelers in action. Bring a sweater for the tour though, the aging rooms can be quite chilly.Then, end you visit with a complimentary wine tasting in the tasting room. We tried several specialities and left with 3 or 4 bottles of wine and champagne at great prices. The store also is an importer of rare and hard to find wines, so it is a great stop for connoseurs. I can guaruntee that we will be going back often!",chloe173
