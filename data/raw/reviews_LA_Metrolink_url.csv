10,Crappy Customer service,"I bought an adult 7-day pass but wanted to swap it for a student youth one. They first wouldn’t give me a refund and the lady was rude as hell about it. Information is confusing and the times are unreliable. Trains themselves are not bad tho, just ran by crappy people.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/282rikis
50,One of the best we have experienced,"Have used metrolink a few times over the years. Everything from going to the John Wayne airport in Irvine, to LAX, to having fun up in LA (Los Angeles). Where to start on what makes this so good...Usually take from Oceanside (farthest southern stop) and go from there. Lots of cheap pay parking available here if you need . Have always bought 1 way tickets (you can get monthly passes if you ride regularly) in Oceanside and then the return from LA. Tickets can be bought online (create a login and download the app (or print 1 way ticket out)) or from a kiosk - intuitive (but sometimes has problems reading cc - be patient) and you can purchase these for a date in the future. And speaking of costs - on weekends you can ride as much on metrolink (the same day) for $10.Trains are comfortable - lots of seats in good shape - some seats have tables with them. Restrooms available. Trains have always been timely when I have ridden and has never been too packed. And if you are along the coast, you have a good water view thru San Clemente.Do not confuse metrolink w/ the metro bus/train system in LA. They are two different systems but the good part is that your metrolink ticket allows for free rides on most metro buses/trains - really how cool is that. You can also connect w/ shuttle to John Wayne airport (free) from the Tustin station and flyaway shuttle to LAX (fee applies) from LA Union Station.Such a better alternative than driving to and from LA for us as long as you can get where you need to go w/ public transportation. The only downside is the amount of trains that run. If I missed the train coming back, would hop on the next Amtrak going south.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jenLeCreate
40,Reliable for getting around,"I've taken the Metrolink for two trips from Irvine up to LA, and for both, the trains left on time which I appreciate.When I went this month (Jan 2020), there was also ample seating, so you don't ever have to worry about finding seats. Some seats (could only find one) have power sources next to them.Some of the mezzanine levels also have tables if you need to do work/eat, which was great for me.The trains are mildly shaky, but not to the point that it's distracting, and I find them quiet enough.My favorite part about taking the Metrolink is free transfers to LA's Metro subways and buses. At the stations, you just scan the QR code of your Metrolink ticket (I bought my tickets on the app) to enter the platform. For buses, you just show your QR code to the driver. I thought it was very convenient and definitely a good incentive to take the LA Metro.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lelahbelle
50,We extensively used it,"We travelled extensively around LA, all by public transport that overall we found quite efficient.Trains were the best, taking them to Pasadena, Santa Monica and Hollywood. Coming home from Rancho Palos Verdes we hopped on the Silver Line for the last segment to Downtown.Artistic designs and pieces are lovely features of stations. In particular we admired Hollywood / Vine, Memorial Park and Hollywood / Highland stations.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/permia
10,Shouldn't be happening.,Took the metrolink last week to the union station from San Bernardino. It took three hours! Because we had a 40 minute delay. It shouldn't take longer to get to L.A on the train.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/insaneo2019
40,metrolink calif. orange line,"if ever in LA area take a ride on the metrolink orange line to oceanside ca. the ride is decent. you go from city sights. to the fullerton station .which i would recommend to pay a visit to if you are in any way a railfan. it is a very good spot for railfanning , from UP, to BNSF, to Amtrak, to Metrolink. it hen continues south to san juan capistrano station. the tracks then preceed to running right next to the beach for many miles including san clemente pier you can look out to the west and the pacific ocean is there along the beach front. oceanside is destination which is also along the ocean front. if you want a ride with ocean view for a while try the metrolink orange line.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/okfine9
50,Great way to avoid traffic,The $12 fee from Mission Viejo to LA was wonderful. Easy to purchase tickets at kiosk. Well lit station in Mission Viejo. Busy downtown but a wonderful option to be able to get into town and not have to pay expensive parking,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ritatayenaka
50,Great way to get home after a long bike ride,"We live in Irvine California and often take long rides on the weekend to Oceanside (50 miles) for lunch and take Metrolink home. It’s cheap on weekends ($10 anywhere they go for the day), reliable, does not need reservation for bike (like Amtrak), has a dedicated bike car, and is a relaxing fun ride back home. We need to try it to LA destinations in the future!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/campfamily50
50,Short ride,Took train to Irvine from San Juan Capistrano short ride it was greatBetter than fighting the freeway,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/garypK3165RD
50,Rolling out of LA,"After taking the Flyaway bus from LAX to LA Union Station; I jumped on the Metrolink Orange County line headed south to Oceanside. Train left on time, it was uncrowded and I was able to take advantage of the $10 weekend fair; made it home no worries.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/I9421BKgregb
50,"Union Station, convenient, clean and affordable!","Union Station, convenient, clean and affordable. My experience is on the Metrolink from Ventura County to Union Station. The trains on all the train routes are similar, so I would expect the train experiences would be alike.Convenient to buy the Metrolink ticket at the Camarillo train station. The ticket machine was intuitive and easy to use. Train schedules are posted at the station. They are also found on line.Metrolink train arrived on time and arrived at Union Station as expected. The Metro Station is in the Union Station basement. Easy to get to Long Beach, Pasadena and Santa Monica from Union Station.The Ventura County Metrolink stops at the Burbank Airport. It is a short walk to the terminal. Easy to tie the train time to the Southwest airline schedule. Better and cheaper than leaving a car at the airport.Take time to explore Union Station. Beautiful building.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Cavydad
30,Decent Enough,"If you're experienced with commuter train service in big cities like New York, Washington DC, and Chicago, LA's Metrolink service approximates the experience. Where it falls a bit short is in the chaotic layout of Union Station. Signage is poor, help is scarce, and the whole experience feels more like a dingy old old bus station than a train station. Even New York's Penn Station feels more open and inviting. At least, that was the experience after being dropped off by the FlyAway bus. I'm told it is nicer elsewhere in the terminal. Anyway, the trains are basically clean although they could use some TLC. The service itself seemed quite reasonable and inexpensive. I went from Union Station to the Burbank Airport North station in under 30 minutes and under $5. You can buy tickets from vending machines that are pretty straightforward to use. Travel tip: if you're heading to Burbank airport, go to the South Station on the Ventura Line. You can also get there from the North Station on the Antelope Valley Line but it's a bit of a walk or you can call for a free on-demand shuttle.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ALocksley
50,Weekend pass for day trips!,"We took the Goldline to Union Station and then Metrolink to San Juan Capistrano for the day and it was fantastic!! Reasonable cost per-person and free transfers for Metro + NO driving or traffic!! We will be day-tripping with Metrolink again in the future.Out of town visitors, the Metrolink is a fantastic way to see Orange Country from your base in LA, or alternatively, your basecamp in OC or Riverside or Palmdale to visit LA without needing a car or dealing with our congested freeways. Just be sure to research your destination beforehand to know what is avail at each stop to eat, see, and do. Note that some stations are more commuter oriented and less touristy. Also, some cities will have better public transportation to/ from the station, just plan ahead and enjoy the ride!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CAZADOR-CA
50,Fantastic Value,"We went on a city tour and it took us 2 hours by road to get from our hotel in Downtown to Santa Monica where the tour started. The tour was great, but the following day we went to Santa Monica by the relatively new expo metro line. It was fantastic. You have to purchase a card which costs you $2 and then top the card up for your travel. To get to Santa Monica from Downtown, it cost just 35 cents off peak for seniors (62+) and only took an hour. Absolutely brilliant. If we come back to LA again, we would definitely use this, even instead of an Uber.Well done LA!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SagaloutsTour
40,"Inexpensive Way to Beat Traffic, Relax and See LA","I use Metrolink about twice a month to get to Union Station in Downtown LA. My commute is relaxing because I am not stressed driving in LA's traffic, and I get to my destination much faster than if I were to drive there.What's great about Metrolink is that it goes beyond LA, so you can skip the drive to various places past LA County and see the neighboring cities in a new light.And you can link up to metro station and bus stops.Plus, you'll be saving unnecessary CO2 emissions by taking Metrolink.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AniGarib
10,Worst commute service,"If you are planing to take Metrolink to work, be prepared to be late every single day. Inaccurate information provided about delay times.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelerbugv
40,Good Experience,"I took the Metrolink from Fullerton to Union Station at rush hour. The train was on time, but a little late getting into Union Station. It was a smooth, quick ride. Good views of the clogged freeways from the upper level., Both stations were clean. The senior rate was only $4.25.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AZ1912
50,Great first experience,"Last week I flew into Burbank Airport and was able to catch the 12:30 pm Metrolink train to Union Station. This midday train, which had turned st Burbank Airport, only had a few passengers, but was clean and attractive and the conductor very friendly. I purchased the tickets on the app and it was good for a free transfer to the subway. This ride was much better than the return trip on Amtrak to Burbank on Sunday afternoon, which was jammed. If I have any criticism of Metrolink, it is that the off hour schedules are rather sparse and this line does not operate weekends.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EAZELIFF
10,Frequently delayed,"If you want unreliable transportation with awful customer service, Metrolink is the way to go. They lie about their compensation policy for delays. The ocean views near San Clemente are nice. But you can't depend on Metrolink getting you to your destination.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MrPaul1080p
50,Cheap way to commute to/from LA,"I had an awfully long layover at LAX in my attempt to get home during a snow storm. My friends who live up in Santa Clarita got me from airport but were unable to drive me back down. My option on a Sunday night was limited to Lyft/Uber from Santa Clarita to LAX, which was over $50. Then I found the Metrolink option, which took 1 hour to get into LA Union Station for $7.50. I then got an Lyft for $27 to LAX.LA Union Station has Metro connection (red, gold & purple lines) within the station. You can take them to other places (ex. Koreatown & Chinatown). If it wasn't a Sunday night, I could have taken the FlyAway bus OR via Red, Blue & Green lines for alot cheaper to LAX.And don't forget around the corner from Union Station has a taquitos joint (Cielito Lindo) for a quick cheap bite!Both the local station & Union Station were clean, well light, and was easy to navigate. The train was on time. It was a very pleasant experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Globetrot4Food
50,Best way to get around,"If you are traveling anywhere along the Metrolink lines, consider it over driving. The freeways in LA and OC are horribly crowded and not safe if you are a newbie. The train is clean, safe and prompt. My ride today from Tustin to Laguna Niguel cost $6.25 and Uber would have been $30 for the same trip. It’s the way to go.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/littlemomma_1955
50,Vincent Hinojoso,Honestly Vincent is perfect for this job. He treats everyone with respect and makes my trips worth the money. Thank you for hiring him which allows passengers like myself enjoy the train so much more.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trinafloresre
50,Great way to beat the traffic,Great ride from Irvine to LA Union Station for a day exploring the downtown. Great way to go. European lifestyle in the USA - train it!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/trishsoto
40,Great Weekend Value,"The 10 dollar unlimited rides and transfers is an amazing deal.I get on the early train from San Bernardino depot and zip downtown to Union Station, then transfer to the Expo line and wham, I'm at the beach in Santa Monica. It gets you close to the pier and promenade.You still have time to hit up Chinatown and even Hollywood I'd you are a savvy rider. The absolute best way to see LA in a day!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RangerNate
50,Buena Park Metrolink train Station,"Went to the Buena Park Metrolink Train station to watch the trains for a while. I was just blown away by how BEAUTIFUL it was. Thus was my first visit to this station!!It has a beautiful Gazebo, the architecture is Amazing and it’s less crowded than the Fullerton station is.If your kids like 🚂 trains...this is the place to bring them. They can see Metrolink, BNSF freight trains and Amtrak. Watch out though....the Amtrak flies through the station. The weekends are better since the parking is wide open. I’m sure during the week the parking lot is full due to people who ride the train into work.Have fun!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/119yvonnej
40,on staff's recommendation we took the train to San Clemente and were glad we did,"I am an Angeleno native but haven't lived there for 17 years so I am loving that now when I come to LA the system is developed enough that with the help of Uber that I can actually use public transportation even for long distances.The lovely lady at El Monte station told us about the $10 all day tickets so we took her advice and took the train to San Clemente and back. Just make sure to check if trains are running at the times you want as it is quite limited especially on the weekends. For instance for us to get to San Clemente from El Monte there were only two trains so we had to actually go all the way to Union Station from which there are four southbound trains per day.It was late getting out of Union Station as the connecting train was late, but otherwise once we were underway the ride was uneventful and smooth. The scenery is quite industrial so it's good if you're into that kind of thing. But once you are in southern Orange County it is absolutely lovely and when you get off the train literally your feet are in the sand.There were lots of families getting on and off the train all along the route so I am very glad to see that it was being well utilized. Trains are comfortable. Stops are very brief so no dilly dallying!HIghly recommended for visitors, for locals, everyone get on board!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PRKPinCH41
40,Allday weekend travel for discounts,"I actually decided to head to san clemente for the ocean festival in july, but just decided i didn’t care to drive all the way down and then of course one has to deal with the hourly parking rate. Anyways there are multiple ways to purchase a fare including via the metrolink app. It turns out on weekends metrolink offers a $10 all day pass so one could make a cheap visit to places like san clemente beach which unlike the jam packed crowds in LA beaches. For folks catching the train from LA union station what a deal",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hoben01
10,Burbank Airport Service - let’s keep it a secret,"Arguably the best airport train service in the country - only one hitch. The train gods have decided to label two stops on two different lines as “Burbank Airport” - it’s my understanding that only the Burbank Airport South VC station is actually at the airport. The other one is kinda close, but not close enough.... Super confusing to us riders - not sure why they don’t clear up the confusion.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/peterm312
10,Shocking Service,I bought two tickets from the machine at the Anaheim station to Los Angeles but the machine only printed 1 ticket. There was no Metrolink staff at the station and the station and Amtrak staff were not able to assist. As the machine hadn't given me the correct tickets I had to buy 2 Amtrak tickets and travel on their service instead.When I got to Union Station I spoke to a Metrolink staff member who gave me a $17.50 refund but would not give me the other $17.50 refund as I had to provide a bank statement.I was told that I had to send my bank statement once I got back to the UK. I should not have to do this as the problem is the problem of Metrolink.I was treated badly and made to feel like I had done something wrong when I hadn't. I feel like Metrolink have stolen $17.50 off me and I am not happy about it. I would never attempt to use their service again.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/846deang
30,Easy way to get around,The Metrolink system in Los Angeles is a great way for visitors to get around. It runs from Long Beach to the San Fernando Valley and from Santa Monica to Pasadena. The trains are clean and easy to use and the costs are reasonable.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/buffalojim67
40,Clean and quick,"As long as it is going where you need to go (or near where you need to go), this is an excellent urban rail system. The stations and trains were clean and well marked. The prices are on par with other major cities in the world. Will be great once it is connected with LAX and downtown.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsj5777
50,Great for a weekend day trip,"You can ride all day on the weekend for one low price and the schedule is frequent enough that you can have a nice getaway from Union Station to places like Anaheim, Irvine, San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente and even to Oceanside in San Diego County. You can also go to other places on other lines. The trains are efficient and on time and the ride is very comfortable.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/geotech522
40,I wish it was like this when I worked in Los Angeles!,"I'm retired now but I wish taking the Metrolink was really an option for me when I worked in downtown Los Angeles let alone Riverside.But my just-turned-3 grandson is all about trains. Like probably every other 3 year old boy, he loves Thomas Trains and just goes nuts anytime he gets the opportunity to ride a real train. Even the shopping mall trains excite him tremendously.So one of the things this grandpa gave him for Christmas was a ride on the Metrolink from the ""West Corona"" to the ""Orange"" station. I selected the Orange location due to its proximity to restaurants for lunch (read my Ruby's / Streamliner TripAdvisor review). It was wonderful. As a kid my mom and I used to drop dad off at the Southern Pacific station for transit to San Francisco up the Peninsula. But I don't remember trains like this.The Metrolink is really big and its passenger cars (at least the one I was in) had 3 levels and space for your bicycle or skateboard or whatever. It was smooth, spacious, quiet (on the inside as boy it is loud as it approaches the station), clean, smoke-free and cost-effective. Seniors (over 65) ride at half price and accompanied children under 5 ride for free. So talk about a great way to take your grandchild for an outing ... this is it! Just make sure to hold children's hands tight as the trains are deceptively fast and cannot stop as fast as a child can run.We took it during a weekday departing in mid-morning and returning just after lunch. Since I had not been on a train in 40 years I asked the Conductor to remind my grandson ""Mr Owen"" (but it was really for me) when it was his time to get off. And can you believe it? He actually announced it over the intercom after his normal announcement for that stop! The conductor also allowed us to take pictures of him taking Mr Owen's tickets. I'm blacking his face out on the attached picture ... but he was soooo happy.We enjoyed it so much we are planning another Metrolink ride to Riverside and maybe another to the San Clemente Pier. What a great way to enjoy ""an adult drink or two"" and not have to worry about driving, let alone those outrageous Fast Track fees and obnoxious 91 Freeway traffic! How I wish the Metrolink would have really been an option for me when I worked in downtown LA. I could have cut my commute time, car and parking expense, AND been able to do some work on my laptop or just relax and read the paper.Speaking of parking ... at least for now they are not charging for parking at the ""West Corona"" station. A HUGE plus. But I hope the folks at Metrolink read this review as they could do a much better job of providing train station information (ie which side of the track you must board the trains) than they currently do. Fortunately the Security Guard (not employed by Metrolink) was enormously helpful in that regard as well as being probably the best non-paid spokesperson that Metrolink could ever have.You have to go over a 50+ step (or elevator) to get to the other side of the tracks. So if your train picks up on the other track and you are running tight on time you might miss your train. And that is the ONLY reason I give it a 4 out of 5 rating. Fyi, the attached picture of the signage at the Orange Station is more like what it should be.I hope all of the parents and grandparents that read this review now look at Metrolink in a new light. Your kids and grandkids will never let you forget the experience that both of you will enjoy.PS One of the questions I just answered before submitting this review was whether this offered an activity. For most everyone, no. For my purpose in this trip, definitely YES!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/help32250
40,Great way to get around without the worry of where to park.,"It is easy to find your way around LA using the Metro. Buy a TAP card for $1 at any station and load it with a day pass for $7.00 and you can travel anywhere in LA. We travelled mainly during the day and even ventured out to Long Beach. I am not sure I would take the Long Beach line at night and there were lots of public service warning messages on that line. Having said that, we felt safe both ways and Long Beach was well worth the journey. We were also able to use the TAP card on some bus routes and the was a great way of getting to locations not on the rail lines.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/rustygrecian
50,Excellent! England take a lesson,Metrolink runs from surrounding areas into LA with reasonable frequency on weekdays and poor frequency on weekends.Trains are double decker with plenty of seats in good condition. The trains are clean and comfortable.Ran pretty much on time and if there was anything to delay it even for a few minutes a clear and timely announcement was made.Prices were fair and INCLUDE Metro travel for the day when buying a return Metrolink ticket.My only criticism is the small number of ticket machines on the station.If ever I need to go into LA I will take Metrolink. It is excellent and in comparison to similar services in England it puts the UK to shame!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Torlus
30,Easy Way to Get to LA,"We are so lucky that we can travel via rail to LA from SB Valley. We embark at the origin of the route at the historic Santa Fe Depot in San Bernardino. Our destination is the iconic Union Station in LA. Our journey takes only 1 hour and 40 minutes, after 11 stops. After exiting Union Station, it's so easy to walk across Alameda St. to Olvera St. and El Pueblo de Los Angeles, the center of Mexican culture in LA. There are wonderful restaurants and museums to explore. Also, nearby is Little Tokyo and Chinatown. I would have given a higher rating, but the bathrooms on the train are sometimes out-of-order from the beginning and can get really messy at the end of the train ride.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/socaltravelers2016
10,We would give it zero if possible,I used this a few years ago and loved it but we actually did anaheim all 4 days instead of our planned 3 due to our experience. First their announcements are confusing. They said a train was cancelled then it was coming but kept doing the cancelled one which is it? Then our train was over a half hour leaving from LA. It stopped due to a computer issue at the first station but then after a half hour they said we had to get towed back to union and crammed on the next train which left late again then almost needed a mechanic half way through the trip. Is this typical because we have a similar system at home and I have heard of this happening but never on the trip all at once. We got back to our hotel 5 hours after we should have left and I just felt sorry for the people with kids as we were hungry as adults and no announcements was made for food vouchers at the station or taxi money etc. I had an issue with amtrack delayed a few years ago so not sure if it is the station or what.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/StephanieC79
40,Fullerton Station,"The Fullerton, CA station is a fun place to take kids who love to watch trains up close. The Metrolink, Amtrak and freight trains stop here on a regular basis. Have dinner or lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory before or after. The parking lot is available for both the OSF and the train. There are some tables inside the restaurant where you can see the trains and if you request one, they usually will accommodate your request if a table is available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KarenK518
50,Best kep secret in southern California,"After examining all the ways to get around in LA area, specifically from Inland Empire to San Diego, we discovered Metrolink. It travels on the same tracks as Amtrak for about 10% of Amtrak's price. So instead of taking the Surliner or Pacific Coastliner or any Amtrak, we took Metrolink on the same track, with the same ocean views, from Ontario East to Oceanside for $8.25 (senior price). Another $2.75 on the Coaster took us into San Diego's Santa Fe Depot. We did not have reserved seats - instead, we had the upper level of a car all to ourselves, had a table in a 4-seat section, and could change seats if we wanted to. There are restrooms and water fountains on board, but no cafe car and no luggage racks or any provision for luggage. It is basically a commuter train, but every bit as comfortable as Amtrak with padded seats and lots of leg room. Total round trip for a couple of days in San Diego was $22. We had to change at Union Station but it was easy - just move to another track.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClassicTheatre
