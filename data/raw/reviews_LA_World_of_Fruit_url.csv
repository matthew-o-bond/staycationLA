50,Great Stop,I completely enjoyed this pop up The staff goes above and beyond to interact with every member of the group. Also being very knowledgeable of camera settings and taking that picture for you is amazing. So many photo spots are available. But the best thing of all is the variety of fruit you get to try and the Popsicle sticks. Watermelon room is the best plus some pineapple. @Acobian2 August to view a slideshow and pictures,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Acobian2
50,AWESOME! Do it!,"If you love fruit, pictures, fun, have kids, want IG/Facebook/Snapchat pics, this is the place to be! My daughter is 14 and absolutely loved this place. The pop up market is huge these days, but this one is a very underrated, huge hidden secret! One of the guys at the front, forgive me, I think his name is Alexander? had such passion, energy, excitement we were immediately immersed in positive, good vibes and anticipating our experience. We’ve been to the museum of ice cream and just the sheer number of people, waiting in line to get in, you feel like a herd of cattle, the experience is not really individualized or customized. This one was just the opposite and I’m thinking bc it’s not as well known, or just the saturation of the market. The rooms are well thought out, the host/hostesses are accommodating, sweet, and go at your pace, you never feel like you are being rushed bc the next group is coming in. In our case, we came early, since I read that sometimes they have valet, but most parking is street parking and based on previous experiences with these we didn’t want to risk missing our time slot. Instead we found parking right when we got there on the street, we jumped out and checked in 15 minutes early as it says, but no one else was there, so they arranged for a girl to host just my daughter and I and it made for the best experience with no one else in the way or background in any of our pictures! There are unlimited cute fruit rooms and picture opportunities and our hostess was fabulous, bc she gave us ideas of what other people have done and posed, and positioning and our pictures came out exactly the way we envisioned them too! The fruit treats were amazing, we got a watermelon pop in the watermelon room, probably our favorite room and treat, then you get an açaí bowl in another room and last we had a buffet of exotic fruit! Although we are from Hawaii and knew almost all the fruits, my daughter found one, jackfruit that she had never tried and kept raving about how delicious it was. There were fruits from Africa, Asia, all over, the one thing was they didn’t know a lot about the exotic fruit that they should probably google and read up on since they are part of the world of fruit! All in all, I would highly recommend taking a break from Disney, shopping, theme parks, and connect over fruit with your family at this fun concept......plus fruits are so good for you!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alohaoe808
