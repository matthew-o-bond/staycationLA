40,Busy but beautiful,Busy as you would expect for an August weekend but a nice beach spot with a lovely lagoon which attracted some nice birds to watch.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/clairemeech
40,Pleasantly surprised!,"This place is actually pretty good! I was skeptical because I saw pictures of the lagoons with the stagnant water and gross-looking birds, but the beach itself, the ocean side, is really gorgeous! And it is mellow, not crowded at all! LOTS of surfers were there so it was kind of interesting to watch that, too. It is surprisingly clean of litter, except for the sea life that ends up ashore. The sand is smooth, the waves are fun, it is a nice place to go! The lifegaurds were conscientious, too. Only knock on the place is that I didn't see a place to shower/rinse off sand and the port-a-potties there were horrific. Other than that, we had a blast there!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hussyfskap
20,Not so good experience,"Area was lacking support facilities like bathrooms, food places etc. Sea weeds was all over the beach was full of rocks as well. Life guard was available on-site however I am not planning to visit the same place again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/uqailimz
50,Excellent base for some beach exploration,"Has spectacular cliff views. Descent requires some agility, however well worth it. Sand is super clean.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/avidtraveler5
30,Wish I had a better experience..,"We were in Simi Valley for the day, and on our drive back to LA decided to detour through Malibu as we wanted to see the place everyone talks about. Granted, it was a horribly wet and rainy day, but we did stop and try to look around. It would probably be a better experience on a hot, sunny day, but overall we weren't sure what all the raves were about to be honest.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/worleybird98
50,Excellent base for some beach exploration,"This place was quite a find. For a reasonable parking fee (as little as $3 for one hour or $12 for all day), you have access to a lovely stroll around the lagoon (lots of birds to be seen) with plenty of benches and picnic tables to stop and relax. Once you walk all the way around the lagoon, you are on the Pacific Ocean beach, where you can sunbathe, swim, surf or just walk and enjoy the view. You are also a short walk from the free Adamson House exhibit. This was a very civilized and easy way to get to spend some time at the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KatrinaPa
50,Great quite beach,"Nice and quite beach, plenty of cheap parking. Beach is a 5 min walk from car park. Not as busy as some of the beaches we passed - a couple of porta-loos if you get caught short. Plenty of waves for surfing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/epic9990

10,Discrimination Against Disabilities,"I came here with my service dog at about 11 am on October 5th, 2018.I was promptly denied access by a lifeguard after paying for parking. I asserted to the lifeguard my dog is a service dog and I could even provide paperwork in the car.Lifeguard ignored this offer and replied that I would only be allowed to stay with my service dog if I had another disability: specifically if I was blind or epileptic.There are other disabilities that require service dogs including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.LA County Beaches does not allow disabled persons with service dogs.When I called the office to file a complaint, the employee criticized me for wasting their time.This is blatant discrimination against disabilities.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/378jennb
50,Relaxing fun in the sun,We love to go here and in the evenings watch the fish jump and skip across the water. At times is seems as if they're racing each other and look like a stone skipping across the water.It's a nice walk to view the lagoon and then go to the beach.Across PCH is the Malibu downtown where you can get something to eat and take it with you to the lagoon.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DennisFF_13
50,Spectacular cliff views,Really beautiful part of the Cali coastline. Tough descent but worth it to go to each below. Sand is clean and clear,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LaurieK187

50,Beauriful lagoon and beach,"The water was so nice and the waves of moderate proportions. The lagoon is off limits but watching the birds was very interesting. We spent a nice afternoon swimming and relaxing on this beach. The Malibu Village is right across the parking lot on the PCH and that‚Äôs a great plus. You can add shopping, lunch at Malibu Kitchen and ice cream at GROM to your Malibu Lagoon beach day. :)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ForeverCharmed

40,Very Cool Experience!!,Everyone has heard of Malibu beach and lagoon and the surf beaches.

50,I think my favorite Malibu beach,"I love going to the beach, and love this short stretch of beach. I find parking every time in the lot, 8 dollars a day/takes credit cards. Walking to beach is not overwhelming and for me that makes such a big difference when carrying stuff for family from the car. There is a bathroom right next to lot. Theres also museum next store. I think this is also known assurf-riders beach. Just pay attention to the signs on beach as one side designated for surfers. Oh and lifeguard always on watch. You could also walk to pier from beach. There is also a lagoon which you would walk down beach to get to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DayTrip597326

50,Crowded PCH and a nice beach,Crowded PCH and a nice beach. Outstanding place to watch and observe the surfers. Beach is often crowded.

10,"The good, the Bad and the Ugly...","Our Godson, who loves to boogie board was visiting from Germany. He's a very sweet kid (16 years) and we took him here, just a bit north of Surfrider beach. The lagoon beach itself is decent. You arrive there after walking through a lagoon filled with birds. We saw some snowy egrets on the way. Our good time, though, ended after we sat down on the beach between the two orange flags just north (I think) of Surfrider Beach. We had stopped at the lifeguard tower and had checked the info, so we knew it was ok for him to boogie board between the orange flags (the tower chalkboard explicitly stated so). Once we sat down, though, a lifeguard sat down next to our Godson and really hassled him, telling him that the beach ""IS FOR SURFERS ONLY!"" and that he was not allowed to boogie board!! That, we knew was a lie. We were polite but told the guy that our Godson was going to boogie board and that was that as far as we were concerned. The lifeguard (who by the way looked as far away from athletic as a guy could look..) wouldn't leave and kept insisting that if our Godson ""bothered"" the surfers there would be dire consequences for us. The guy was beyond an a*hole and, a few days later, we reported the incident to the state park system. Completely ruined the day for us!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Hakally
50,Worth the walk,It is a bit of a hike from the parking area but the walk to the beach is aside the lagoon which is packed with wildlife. There's these jumping fish which is just a wild thing to witness.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/fayegarrow
40,Cool stop on the PCH,"We were on a road trip up the PCH and stopped here for about 2 hours. The weather was beautiful, the skies were clear, the conservation efforts are a real perk of this attraction. We didn‚Äôt see much wildlife but we were here during the middle of the day and I believe they come out more in the evening. Great stop along the PCH and I do recommend you check it out.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
50,First visit to a beautiful lagoon - well worth more visits!,Was thrilled to see such a beautiful and well kept lagoon. Impressed with the conservation efforts to maintain the natural habitat and encourage wild life and vegetation to maintain the beauty of the area. Easy access to the beach with excellent surfing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/377Rosa

Beware that the Pacific ocean is very cold, but the views are just stunning! Candidly, this should be a ""bucket list"" item for all beach lovers like myself. I am so glad I got to see it.

30,Nice Stop Off of Pacific Coast Highway,"I stopped here with my family on the way to another State Park in Malibu to go camping. It was a nice spot to stop and eat our picnic lunch. We walked on the path that lead to the beach. On the walk we saw some sea birds and fish jumping out of the water. There were areas of the laguna that had a very foul odor and we saw a couple of dead animals while walking on the path. The beach at the end of the path was nice and there were a lot of surfers coming and going throughout our two hour visit. There are port-o-potties available at this park. Just like other California State Parks, there is a cost for parking with hourly and daily rates available.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Duffyruns

40,"Beach, wetlands, and surfers",We took a short walk along the path to get to the beach. There are several signs describing the ecology of the area. Lots of bird life in the lagoon. It was amusing to see a rusting VW minibus on the beach at the end of the path. Lots of surfers off the beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/chitownsam
20,Let Down,"The drive from Santa Monica to the park was the most interesting part. California is experiencing a drought, so that may have contributed to the lack of water in the lagoon. However, all we saw was a mud pit... so we turned around and drove back to Santa Monica. At least we can say we drove along the Pacific Coast.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Macon08
50,Lovely: BUT PLEASE RESPECT NATURE,"They have done a beautiful job restoring the wetlands here. You can see many species of birds and the tidepools are beautiful. BUT I saw many people sticking their hands INTO the living tide pools and pulling things out. SOme were taking things home?! PEOPLE these are living things. Protected. this is actually a protected natural habitat. do not touch anything and please dO NOT stick your hand in the tide pools. even if you see a shell uninhabited,,, this serves as a future home for another sea creature! This is not "" free shells time""! and also you are not being more respectful if the shell is empty and that is the only time you would ' take it"" . Just do as the signs say and DO NOT TOUCH the tidepools . RESPECT NATURE. Live it, learn it. Thank you.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lucylover44
50,Gorgeous Beach,I went with my husband and teenagers today. The weather was wonderful and the views were stunning. It was a nice surprise how our teenagers quit texting and quit with the Snapchat for the two hours we spent walking on the beach. We had such a great time together!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/7books
50,Great spot to walk and relax,"This is a great little spot right off the PCH to pull over, stretch your legs and enjoy the scenery. You can look south towards Los Angeles as the coast bustles with homes and buildings, or look right in front of you at the lagoon and beach where birds and nature exist as they have always done. Sunsets are great from this spot, but there are no facilities, so be forewarned.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bsimonis

40,Very beautiful hot September day!,"Visited Malibu on a Sunday afternoon. It was one of those scorcher days in LA and this was a wonderful escape. So fresh and I loved the nature...it was so close to LA. I was expecting a much longer drive. The traffic was actually quite acceptable too. I can definitely see why it is as popular as it is with the Hollywood elite. Beaches are beautiful, people are very friendly, nice restaurants (healthy ones too) and dog friendly! I will definitely return to this beautiful place but since I live in Miami (actually Key Biscayne, which is for Miami a lot like what Malibu is for LA) I will NOT be swimming. The water is freezing!!!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/punnina65
50,Beautiful beach,"We really loved Malibu. When you enter Malibu there is a sign saying '27 miles of scenic beauty'. That's exactly our experience. The beaches, the beautiful villas, the surfers,... Everyone who visits LA, should take a day to see Malibu as well.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OzTn
40,Go early if you want to park,"Malibu beach runs for about 12 miles (20 km) and its southern end is about 20 miles from Santa Monica. You can drive to it from Santa Monica along the Coast Highway 1 (El Camino Real) or go north west on highway 101 from which there are many roads going to the coast. We used Los Virgines which takes you via the Malibu State Park, then back via Highway 1.Both Malibu beach proper and Zuma Beach further north were very crowded late on a Sunday morning towards the end of August, and parking was nearly impossible. We only got parking at Zuma because we were going to the Sunset Restaurant and Bar which offers patrons valet parking for $5. If you drive further there is supposedly more parking for $10 but I don't know how many hours this covers. The beach reminded me of scenes from the Baywatch TV show but I didn't recognise Pamela or David.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jmeem42016

40,Beautiful beach,"We stopped by here after having breakfast at the Malibu Country Mart, which is pretty much across the street. Parking in the lot was available on Fri. morning but full when we left before noon. There's a bit of a walk around the lagoons to get to the beach. It was busy when we were there, with a surf camp for kids, a few different helicopters whizzing by, and many families. Beach itself was very nice - fair amount of kept but nothing too bad. It looked like the only bathroom facilities were port a potties.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/shannany2015
40,Nice view,We walked up and down the beach after eating at Paradise Cove Caf√©. The view of the water is beautiful. It was a 100 degree day and the water was so cold. The waves brought in a lot of kelp so it was somewhat dirty.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kirbyfive
50,A Surprise for sure! Great for birding and exercise.,"This was a really interesting place. As you pull up you wonder, if this is place is worth getting out.At first glance you see a few pools of water and the ocean in the distance. When you walk around their are signs that explain why the pools form and the wildlife attracted to them.As you walk further down the road towards the ocean you notice all the wildlife that surrounds you. Between the houses and the ponds, rabbits, squirrels, lizards and birds are easy to spot.As you make it to the ocean.. a bit of a walk though very fine sand. (a workout for sure) you can walk along the beach. At low tide (we went at 8am I think) you notice some tide pools. Or at least sea anemones. Didn't really see anything else in the little pools of water.If you look out into the ocean in the distance there is an island filled with pelicans and other birds.As a photographer I wasn't surprised to see a few other folks out there with some nice gear. I was shooting with a 28/300 lens and it was a little short for the island shots that I wanted but pretty good for everything else.The beach was clean and was just a nice place to sit and watch the ocean waves.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LVgabeg

Previous visits we have seen plovers and sandpipers, but not today.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ManjidelMondo
40,Went on a small organized water birds walk with a local guide-very good,"9 o'clock on a breezy but bright Saturday morning. I've been down to the lagoon several times, but have never written a review about it. This particular guided water bird walk (2 hours) was very enjoyable, but what has really impressed me this year is how the renovation work has not just improved the site for visitors (boardwalks and paths), but dramatically changed it for the better. Easy place to walk, wheelchair / pushchair accessible (except for the beach). Take binoculars if you have them - it's worth it!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ESB-UK
50,A short beach walk,Just had a small stroll along the beach in front of the Malibu Lagoon. A very nice and quiet place to spend some time away from the craziness of the city. A good spot for surf too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/theodors2013
50,Great place to take a long walk,"We parked at the Malibu Pier and after checking it out for a while we decided to take a walk on the beach.It turned out to be a long, wonderful walk. We made our way down to the beach and as we walked things got better and better. It was a beautiful, warm, clear, sunny February day. The beach was kind of narrow at first but as we turned the corner, down where the beautiful houses lined the shore, the beach got wider and wider. It was fun looking at all the different style houses.The beach kept getting wider and the water from the ocean separated some different beach areas. We splashed through to a big beach area and we were surrounded by pelicans, seagulls and some odd, little birds with long beaks that stuck them down into the sand looking for snacks.On the walk back there were surfers, young couples and families enjoying themselves. On this glorious day, in this wonderful place it was hard not to.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Bombersfly10

Parking was a tad pricey on the weekend!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AussieAceCo
50,AKA Surfrider Beach,I had never been to this beach before and decided to come to watch the surfers. Parking is $10 in the lot by the pier but spots were plentiful. Walked to the end of the pier and got a fairly good view of the waveriding action although it was a bit far off to the right. You can go up the beach and get considerably closer to the surfers but didn't end up doing it partly because accessibility on that side of the pier seemed dicey on account of private residences. I think there's another lot that you have to use or something. There's a better-than-kitsch gift shop and cafe at the end of the pier also. Go there!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZadieB2
40,Nice walk through a nature path leading to the beach,Nice spot in Malibu to stop and take a walk. There is free parking and benches to sit. The walking path leads to a nice long stretch of beach. It is across the street from a nice shopping center.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/laurapoint

Nice, but least favorite of all look outs","This was a nice and free stop on our Pacific Coast drive.El Matador was our favorite and the Malibu Pier was our second.This place has a lot of unique birds in the wetland area.

I don't know, maybe weather cause differences, but after I enjoyed Venice, and Santa Monica beaches, I would rather come back there again. Tonight is going to be a full moon also. I went in to the water at Malibu beach, and noticed, that water was full of seaweed. Every wave was moving this seaweed around my legs, and I was always trying to free myself from it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/larisao254
30,Worth a stop but not as special as expected,"My husband and I wanted to visit at least one beach in Malibu while in the LA area, and the descriptions of Malibu Lagoon State Beach made it sound like a good choice. Reading the reviews here, I'm not entirely sure we were in the same place as some of the reviewers, because we did not find the area particularly scenic (other than the ocean, of course, which is beautiful anywhere in California).As others have noted, parking can be a problem. We arrived Friday mid-afternoon in July and knew it would be particularly difficult, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money for parking since we were only planning to stay an hour or two. We first tried going to the Malibu Country Mart on the other side of the highway--it has several stores and restaurants and a fairly large parking lot. However, signs there said No Beach Parking and we didn't want to risk being towed. So we drove a little farther north the highway and found a free space on the ocean side. We had to walk the equivalent of maybe a couple of city blocks to get to the entrance to the state beach parking lot.We had read that the Adamson House at the state beach has a platform on the grounds that is a great place to view wildlife, and the grounds are free, but for some reason we could not figure out how to get to the grounds. Instead, we went on the walkway around the lagoon and then on to the beach. We did see a blue heron, snowy egrets, pelicans, and ducks, but the lagoon area did not seem particularly pretty. There were quite a few people on the beach, and the ocean and general coastal view were nice, but honestly we saw much more spectacular beaches and coastal views elsewhere on our Southern California trip.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/freedshop

Malibu Beach is all you imagine it be & more,"An amazing place, its is as beautiful as I imagined in to be, not too easy to park though.There beach was empty apart from a homeless guy asleep... but hey, if you are gonna be homeless, why not be homeless in this beautiful place! Great drive to Malibu from whichever direction you come from, check out the properties too... out of this world!I would love to travel here by harley!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Alison3333
40,Top Beach - Right in Malibu,"Wonderful location to say the least, right in the midst of things. Super beach for walking, water sports and sight seeing. Parking is a challenge, but is doable & there are charges. You'll love it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dblmed
50,Great day trip from LA,"Oh and the beaches are beautiful! Stroll along the beach, bring a picnic and spend the day or have a meal at one of the ocean view restaurants and cafes.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MelissaPeery
50,Breath taking,"This is outstanding beach, the view is gorgeous is giving you a sense of tranquility, the color of the water is amazing. I recommend to go there you are not going to be disappointed!!!!!!! Trust me üòâ",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ritajalca
50,Malibu vacation,A beautiful beach. Beautiful area. Prefer Santa Monica nearby for shopping and dining. Many beach parking lots charge fees. You can park along hwy 1. Don't forget to see the Getty Villa museum. It's awesome.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Shopsalot88
30,"Brought Family, but didn't find it to be spectacular","The beach is beautiful with the mountains in the background, but when my family visited, I wish I would have taken them somewhere else, like somewhere in Orange County because there were just waaaaay too many people there, so if you plan to go, take a number. Also, driving the PCH in this area is treacherous because so many people driving nice luxury cars think they should speed around every curve. I also couldn't stand that so many of the people had the nerve to be wearing their love handles out, but that's only my opinion. You can take it with a grain of salt. I just found ti to be unsightly and unpleasant. My family and I loved the crashing waves. The water is nice and cool year-round and there are plenty of great breezes. Oh, and park strategically, because like I said, it's ridiculously populated",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nicholash965
40,A fun place for the family and kids.,Great for the family on the weekend. Get there early because parking is tough. Pretty safe for kids. Bring food and make a day of it.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/wvillamil
50,Lovely place to spend an afternoon,"A really lovely location, on the beach at Malibu with a colony of Brown Pelicans to entertain you. We spent hours watching them flying from the lagoon, over the sea and back to the lagoon, where we were able to watch them fishing.The beach is beautiful with a newish boardwalk taking you from the car park and around the lagoon to the beach.Car park is a bit expensive at $12, however it is worth every penny to ensure that the lagoon and surrounding area is kept in the first class condition it currently is.All in all, a great way to pass a few hours.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bracknellcrew
40,Walked from the hotel,"Nice park for a relaxing walk & enjoying the outside without having to leave the hotel area. Walked from Malibu Beach Inn more than once during my stay and checked out what had washed up on the beach, waded across the inlet, watched the birds in the lagoon. Nice!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/defiantone
30,"Neat place, small beach","Be prepared to park on PCH a mile away or pay for the small parking lot. It's a decent walk around the archipelago to the actual beach, which is pretty small and usually covered in seaweed. It was neat to visit, not that great to hang out at for some relaxing, calm and quiet beach time.There are better beaches within a few miles. Choose those. Especially at low tide (the lagoon stinks).",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/399jeremyg
50,So incredible,This beach was so incredibly beautiful! It was fun to climb some rocks on the cliffs and watch the breathtaking view of the great pacific from above. Saw some playful seals jumping in the water. Absolutely loved this beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/natzelim2014
50,A beautiful little beach,"The Malibu Lagoon provided just the quiet California beach experience I was looking for. Most of the local beaches in LA are wide expanses of sand, but this cute little lagoon is an exception worth checking out, with its shore-bird and sea-bird population. The informative tables dotted around the lagoon are a nice touch, as they give you info on the whole Malibu watershed and you can get a good overall view of Malibu, with its ridiculous mansions dotted around the dry canyons. The Malibu pier is just next door, and the area is famous for its surfing history. The ""thwock"" of rich people playing tennis is a gentle reminder of the enormous privileges enjoyed by the natives of the area, as are the blockaded ""private"" beaches next door. The parking is an outrageous 12 dollars, but the money collection is so poorly organized by the ever-more bankrupt state park system, that I didn't bother, and didn't get caught.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/drbecca
40,Good for photography,"This is a gorgeous area for photography. The beautiful water, rocks, landscape, backdrop, clean sand, etc. There are a lot of birds and surfers. This is a great place to relax and watch all the surfers (or watch the birds). But if you're not a surfer or sunbather, I wouldn't recommend planning to spend a long time here. It didn't appear to be a good place for swimming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
50,Got to spend a morning here on a field trip a great experience,With a 3rd grade class and a science field trip the Lagoon is a great place for exploration and hands on learning. Maximize on the tactile options for learning and enjoy.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeganL787
50,Beautiful beach oasis,A great wide open beach in Malibu to hang out and relax. Loved all the birds... Tons of them all over the place. The pelicans were particularly striking.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gabrielleflawless
30,Not for family trips,"We were on our first vacation from South Africa, to the States, and Malibu was one the the sights that we had on our list of places to ""Must"" visit. Especially since we see it in american music videos and movies.We were staying in an apartment in Hollywood, and took a long bus ride to Malibu. We found it quite pedestrian. Stunning views, quite rocky and more for surfing than swimming.The views were great though. Was dissapointed, wasting so much time getting there only to spend a short while and head back.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ravesh
30,Great if you are a surfer or like to watch surfers,"A bit crowded for my taste. Lots going on in the water surfing (not a place to swim) prefer Zuma beach for that.The atmosphere on the beach and in the water was a little weird.A little to pumped up ...for what ???. If you are not a seasoned surfer go elsewhere,there are better places to catch a wave / lay on the baech without the Hype.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vincent414
20,you need to know this if you are a beginner or mediocre surfer,"There are many great features of malibu, but unless you are an awesome surfer, with a tough skin, surfing is not one of them. I visited this beach in August and the surf was up. The shops in town are keen to rent to anybody and boards were flying out of the doors. BUT although there were over 200 people in the water, there were only about 20 surfers catching all the waves. The vibe was aggressive and intimidating. I am a female surfer and have never experienced anything like it having surfed in many locations. It is not suitable for beginners, even if almost flat, because the shallows are rocky, and the white water weak, which is what beginners need. The surf shops will not tell you this. What is supposed to be an iconic surfing beach is actually the worst advert for what is a great sport.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/josiec432
50,Wish I lived there,It really is a beautiful place to visit. White sand beach. Tons of surfers up and down the coast. Really cool beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/bigguns182
50,Awesome,"Nice beach, sand is white and lots of space. Lots of family. Volleyball is played. Nice pics of sunset.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tashax4
40,Nature preserve,"You reach the beach by following a boardwalk and sandy path that curves around a marshy area that is closed off from the wider ocean and provides protection for various wildlife and plants. Gives a relaxing view. This beach is past the major surfing area so you can swim in the shallower water; lifeguards call you in if you go deeper where you might collide with a surf board. There are porta potties and a series of picnic tables and stone chairs in the shade near the parking lot. Beware--parking is limited and they keep letting cars in and charging even after the lot is full. But down PC Hwy going south there is another, larger lot about a five minute walk away.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DorothyB97
40,Great for kids,"This lagoon is shallow and great for small swimmers. If you want to walk the beach to the right and look at the beautiful beach homes, it is legal to walk on the coastline near the water. Ignore the signs since all beaches in CA are public. Don't bother residents!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SlyGuy21
40,Awesome beach,"Great beach, clean sand, good for surfing.Easy to find highway street parking if you get there early enough.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Tunaidi
40,Malibu is just that.......Malibu,"I was born and raised in Santa Monica and kept my horse at my friend's house in Malibu. We used to ride our horses along the beaches of Malibu and Zuma Beach (where a lot of the Annette beach movies were filmed) and had the best time. If you are in the area of Los Angeles or Santa Monica, you must take a drive North, along the Coast Highway, towards Malibu. There is one area called Pointe Dume. This is where I kept my horse. It's changed since the 1960's when I was there, but it's still an interesting stop to make. Enjoy Santa Monica and the ocean because it's one of the nicest places you'll find in the area.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TucsonGrammy
30,Still trying to get it healthy,"After much controversy, the lagoon was re-engineered, re-furbished and an attempt to help it get healthy. Locals should visit--This is an important part of the eco-system not only for surf-rider beach area but all of our coast.Still waiting to see the long-term effects of what the state has done.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
50,Great place to view people and scenery,"First off, the picture on Trip Advisor is not Malibu Lagoon, it is a picture of Pt. Dume. They have done some extensive work on the Lagoon, so it's not quite the same as before. I like to park at Surfrider Beach, maybe a half mile south on PCH and walk the beach from the Malibu Pier around the point of Surfrider Beach to the Lagoon area. The scenery along this walk is spectacular. It is fun to to watch or actually surf here, the waves are perfect most of the time. There is no swimming at Surfrider Beach, it is reserved for surfers, but you can swim closer to the pier or closer to the Lagoon. Restaurants are a quick walk away in either direction on PCH. Great place to hang out even if you are not a surfer.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ZumaDawg
40,Good bird-watching spot,"Not surprisingly, it's quite difficult to reach many parts of coastal Malibu, but this is a great exception. There are a number of places to view the wild life but we thought the platform located inside the grounds of the Adamson House was best. Just a beautiful spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MSH-Sussex
30,"Unfortunately ""they"" Let Sewage Flow Into Lagoon & Ocean","Traveled down to LA and stopped at Malibu Lagoon State Beach for what we hoped to be a nice walk (after paying $8 to park!). The odor was telling. Then all the many dead sea creatures littering the beach. The closer we got to the lagoon the worse it smelled. A local walking on the beach told us to be careful to not touch anything and that ""they"" (unsure if local, state office or sewage agency) had let out a LOT of sewage/grey water, etc that made for a foul smelling mess in the lagoon where a lot of birds were avoiding the disgusting ""water"" and so many dead octopi, lobsters, crabs, birds, etc... SO, when it is not filled with sewage runoff or whatever foul, life-killing junk they let out into the lagoon and ocean, it would be a lovely beach and walk to watch and see many birds.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MeNMiSelf
50,Birdwatchers should not miss it... good for surfing and sunbathing too,"The lagoon hosts a great variety of birds: brown pelicans are a common view on California beaches and seagulls are common almost everywhere; but here, in addition to them, we saw two kinds of plovers, some white-headed pelicans plus a lot of other birds, whose names we do not know.We are too old to even try surfing, but many younger guys (including one of about 10 years, supported by his father :) apparently enjoyed the waves a lot.Last but not least, the beach is wide and inviting, as in about the whole area: perfect for sunbathing!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Sergiob703
40,relax away from the crowded beach,"We came out to the beach for a picnic. Parked on hwy and walked in... what a nice place... people we around, surfers were out, life guard on duty... Great place to get pics.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Amaple27
50,The Lagoon,The Lagoon is so beautiful. The variety and amount of birds you'll see will amaze you. It is also a bonus to be at surfrider beach. So classic California.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lazydaisey
50,Also known as Surfers Beach,"This beach is located just north of the Malibu Pier. Street parking in hardly ever available on the Pacific Coast Highway and parking lots are in the $8-10 range. The beach is sandy and low tide reveals many rocks with little sea critters. I have yet to see a live lobster (they must be in deeper water) but their carcasses wash up on shore and are eaten by birds. Lots of wonderful birds... pelicans, Snowy egrets, and more. This is adjacent to the Adamson House, which is a historical site and interesting to visit. The gardens are free to visit, but there is a fee for a guided tour of the house.The surfers are fun to watch and on occasion you see something whacky, like a chair surfer. Bring a picnic, a blanket and beach toys for the kids. There is an area with shallow water for the kids. There are two lifeguard stations, restrooms and an outdoor shower. Spend a fun afternoon and watch the sunset, you'll be entertained. There's a Jack in the Box across the street, but you can do better than that yourself. The famous Malibu Inn is just across the street and has pretty good food.A word of caution: NEVER cross PCH except at the signal. The cars travel pretty fast along this highway.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Ambersea
50,Confirmed - among the world's best beaches,"Malibu beach is a hidden gem. Along the Pacific Coast Highway (and access points) it looks crowded, and eroded along the highway. In reality, the lagoon sand spit extends, almost empty, beyond the crowds near the highway where you can find your own spot and watch as many as 30 surfers try their hand at large, consistent waves.Would recommend parking along the highway and walking well out from crowds to Lagoon beach point.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MaineCascoBay
50,Lovely Malibu Beach,"We were looking for a place to sit and look out at the Pacific and this State beach fit the bill. It has a bird preserve, sandy and rocky beaches, surfers, a lifeguard. No food vendors. All good.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PatSnyder
40,"Beach, birds and waves.","The beach at Malibu Lagoon has a a couple of great advantages....parking nearby if you aren't staying in walking distance, fantastic birds in the lagoon and good surf on both the surf board and swimming sides of the posted signs. Best of all you can walk over to Howdy's for lunch or an afternoon snack. Don't worry about trying to see stars in the Colony. You will or you won't. Just enjoy a great beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KansaTraveller
40,Looks like a favorite beach for surfers,"I took my kids here but it probably is not the best beach for kids who actually want to go in the water. I would say this was more of a surfing beach. There are specific zones set up for surfing and swimming and quite frankly we hauled our boogie boards quite a ways to get to the swimming zone. The water was full of seaweed and mud at the time and not sure if this was from a storm or not but again, kids didn't like it. We usually go to zuma beach but wanted to try somewhere new which probably was not the best idea. It is clean though and scenic and probably better for photographers and surfers and people just tanning.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Carolinelomeli
40,Beautiful Setting,"If you get tired of looking at all the surfers in action, redirect your gaze to Malibu Lagoon and the Adamson Museum grounds directly behind the beach. You can also look at the pier. All very soothing to the point of being zen.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/BBS-FGS
40,currently under massive construction,"As we were startled by the ""bold"", stripped foreground of the lagoon - what used to be a lush rainforest, we were also told (by a local) that the governing agent said ""this was for the environmental improvement."" Bare, nonetheless, and not pretty, to say the least - for the moment, they say. But the beach was really laid back, and with lots of small rocks, ton of sea crawlies are easily found -- sea anemones, sand crabs, and even sea urchins. And for that, it was a hit for the little ones.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/charliewen1
30,Nothing special,"If you are looking for a romantic white sand beach, this is not the place. This beach was a laidback place amid a marsh area. There was hardle anyone when we went there.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CalGirl84
20,Such a Shame,"Was thrilled to find parking close to the entrance...only the entrance was displaced by construction..?? Wish I had known. No change rooms, bathrooms...disappointing.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JannieBoo
40,Tons of rocks!,The beach has a large area with tons of small rocks. If you like rocks you will love it here! A fun place to watch the surfers too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RockynRobyn
20,Pelicans Galore!!!!,"We were rather disappointed to see this beach after reading many favorable reviews. The water level in the lagoon area was rather low & there were few birds. A good portion of the beach was closed off due to protection of some birds. ( We saw no birds in the fenced off area ) The most interesting sight was observing the large amount of resting pelicans, especially when they yawned & stretched. We spent little time there & the fee was excessive ( $12.00?)",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NatureLover99_11
40,Nice beach with small waves!,"This is a great beach to go to with kids. Small, not too crowded, bathrooms are close by and parking is easy and inexpensive.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/491elisae
50,Fun beach with tons of nature to explore,"We loved to see all of the creatures hidden among the rocks on this beach. I wish I had brought water shoes though, I was walking barefoot on the rocks which were quite sharp and full of shells and barnacles. There is also a sandbar that was full of pelicans, it was so fun to watch them. We parked our car for free at the shopping center across the highway then walked along a little path for about ten minutes. It felt very secluded even though there were a lot of other people there. Definitely recommend it.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ksquarednyc
50,Beautiful,"There are so many different kinds of birds, in such quantity, that your head will spin. Bring water shoes, so you can go out on the sandbars and look for sea urchins and stuff.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AiZeeKay
