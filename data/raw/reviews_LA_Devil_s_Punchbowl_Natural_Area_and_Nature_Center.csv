50,"Great hike. Bring sunscreen, bug repellent or net, and plenty of fluids :)","It was a wonderful hike. We hiked in August 2019, and brought sunscreen and plenty of fluids with us. This helped as it did get hot. What we did not prepare for is the tiny bugs (flies I believe), especially at the part when it was shaded. While we got relieved for 0.5 second because it starts to get cooler in the shade, the bugs came right for us. Good thing we brought caps with us and can use the caps to wave the bugs away. If we had bring head net, or some insect repellent, it will be a more enjoyable hike :) Nevertheless the scenery at the very end is worth it. We did not stay too long out at the punchbowl since it was hot. There was a vista right before the gated track to the punchbowl, and that was more shaded (also with no bugs!) :) That may be a place to catch longer rest or get some food :)",Marco Tjioe
40,Good but difficult,"This is a beautiful place to walk; however, some of the uphill areas can be very difficult. The scenery is beautiful - make sure you bring a camera! Trails are marked well, and sometimes deer will come out to graze. Great place for animal and nature lovers!",Marisa
40,Nice area,"We did the 1 mile loop trail and honestly, it wasn't that great. You can see the same views from the overlook at the top of the area so it was not worth it for us.",Ginas418
50,Great views and hiking.,If you enjoy a hike with beautiful sights then you'll love this place as we did. The temps were in the 50's the day we went and it was perfect for hiking. We took the 1 mile route to the bottom of the bowl and back up. Pictures don't do it justice.,MnMidwesTraveler
50,Beautiful Uptilted Rocks,"The random landforms in unexpected places that I find while exploring California continue to impress me such as the uptilted rock formations in Devil's Punchbowl. While staying in the area (Palmdale), my son and I made the 45 minute drive to visit and do the one mile loop hike. It is a moderate hike where you descend 300 feet into the floor of the punchbowl and come back up. We struggled finding the trail path to loop back up after we reached the creek. Finally, we climbed an area to return to the path.The small nature center is nice. It would be neat if they had some t-shirts because while the area is small, it really is an easily accessible and beautiful hiking area. A short video on the area would be beneficial too. I'm one of those that always likes to learn about the area before exploring.",LeslieinTN
50,"Nice hike, but pay attention on the return route – easy to take the wrong fork","Good hike, not too difficult. The trailhead is directly off of the parking lot so if you go to the ranger office and beyond, you’ve gone a bit too far and need to circle back to the parking lot. The rangers set us straight. On the return we missed a turn, but fortunately for us we have my bike GPS with me so I looked at the helicopter view of the terrain and found a quick shortcut back to where we needed to be. Never leave home without it! Turns out it was very easy to miss the correct route, sort of a one way up, but two ways back. Has some steep sections, but anyone in reasonably good condition will have no problem with this hike. Note that the trail is actually called ""Devil's Chair"". I would expect the rangers to explain this better than I can.",joemontana16
50,Jawbreaking natural attraction,"This is one of those places that are so gorgeous and breathtaking that it makes you realize how small you are compared to the grandness of our world. The scenery at Devil's Punchbowl reminds me a bit of Yosemite. Of course, Yosemite is way more beautiful but this place is definitely worth the visit, especially if you live close by! There's several different hikes: 7 mile, 1 mile, or 1/3 mile. Regardless of the hike you pick, there is an amazing view just as you get out of the parking lot and begin the trail. The weather gets pretty hot, so wear a hat, sunblock, sunglasses, comfy hiking shoes, and drink plenty of water. This is a good hike for adults and teens, I wouldn't recommend bringing little kids here",Cyndee L
50,Hiking at the punch bowl.,"Very nice hike, trails well marked and maintained well. Waterfall and stream. Rock climbing all good.",Kelly S
50,Great place to check out,"Been here a few times. The small building has various local animal and area information. The rangers inside are very nice, friendly and informative. You can tell they love their job. Then there's a ton of hiking and exploring to do. Went to the Devil's Chair twice. It's a pretty good hike. I belive 8 miles round trip. If you go in the summer, beware as it's hot as hell!!! Take tons of water and wear a hat and sunscreen. Best to go when the weather is mild or even colder. Check it out. It's FREE, too!!!!!",RLHINCA
50,Nice place to hike,"I’ve been here many times and love going. It never gets old. I enjoy doing the 1 mile loop hike a lot. It’s just nice to get fresh air. There are many trails and things to see. I’ve done most of the devils chair hike but haven’t yet completed it. Relatively close to Lancaster and palmdale, this place is a short drive away and easily accessible all year round. Check out the owls near the parking lot.",Joseph Vanlon
40,A hidden gem..a good short hike,"A hidden gem, amazing landscape. There are 2 hikes - 1 mile long hike properly marked hike gives you a closer look of the canyons. Another 7.5 mile long hike takes you to Devils chair. We did 1 mile long hike, which took us good 40 mins. Don't forget to check owls, snakes and lizards near the visitor center.",Gitika J
40,A nice halfday outing.,"Friday, Nov 10, 2017 was a no school day, we decided to take a family trip to Devil's Punchbowl for a half day outing, Personally, I will do whatever it takes to avoid amusement parks especially when we can experience nature. The drive from the Los Angeles area is approximately 75 miles each way, there is some stop and go traffic along the 5 freeway but once you cross over to Highway 14, speeds increase. The exit to Pearblossom is a nice drive up to the site area, the town has a nice rural feel.The nice thing about this Los Angeles County facility is that it is free to enter and enjoy. Parking is limited to about 30-40 cars, we only saw 6 parked vehicles when we arrived. There are restrooms but it may be best if you stop by the McDonald's on the way up. There is a small visitors center with live snakes and tarantulas behind glass along with a stuffed coyote and fox to view. They have two live owls outside in large cages for viewing, our favorite was the larger one named Squint, he actually hooted for us.The Devil's Punchbowl is a deep canyon caused by the earth's compression along the San Andreas fault, this is what keeps our state from staying flat (like Kansas) but also gives us earthquakes. The hiking trail is a loop, as long as you follow the trail markers and use common sense, it is a safe hike that you can take kids above the age of 7. Most of the trail is easy to moderate though you can lose your footing on steep declines, wearing hiking shoes is suggested over sneakers. The trails do not have hand rails and there are signs of erosion along the path, you need to be careful of these hazards and mind your children or anyone in your party that may slip and fall down hill.Once you reach the bottom of the canyon, the only way back to your car is uphill. I would say the level of difficulty on the way up is mild to moderate depending on your level of fitness and this is definitely a good way for you to get your daily cardio exercise. Try to avoid the hottest part of the day if you can, hiking this canyon after 3pm is much nicer than 12 noon. It took our family about 90 minutes to finish off the loop but we also stopped for photos, looked around, and be still for the peaceful silence.Due to the condition of these trails, we only rated this location a 4 out of 5 in but please don't let this discourage you from visiting this place. You will still have a nice experience with your visit here but just use common sense. Everyone in our group felt better after visiting this canyon.Tip #1: watch your speeds on the way back from the canyon to Highway 14, there is a slight decline to the road and it is easy to exceed the posted speed limit. Unfortunately, we saw many vehicles pulled over by the California Highway Patrol - this area is a speed trap! Use your cruise control by setting it near the speed limit if you can on the way back. A speeding ticket with fines and fees will easily be over $100 in CA not to mention the traffic school or the possible increase in your auto insurance policy.Tip #2: most of your kids will probably be hungry after the drive up and short hike, there is an In-n-Out Hamburger restaurant on the way back on Highway 14, you cannot miss it.",James C
50,Great trip,We came here after seeing it online and it was a great time. The visitor center has a few different snakes and other insects that you can take a look at. There is a .3 loop that was great for our 3 1/2 year old. My wife and I took our little one and our 10 year old on the 1 mile loop. The trail is well marked and there is an elevation drop by the time you reach the bottom. The stream was flowing and was great to take a break at. Overall it took us about 1 hr to hike the entire trail. Will definitely come back and hike some of the other trails.,Donald B
50,Great Hike for beginers,"I've tried several hikes around the devils punchbowl, but there is a 1-mile loop within the devils punchbowl that is great for begineers. I've heard some begineers take around 2+ to finish the loop. There is certainly an elevation difference that can take a toll. You may see a stream while at the bottom shortly after winter, into spring due to the snow pack on the mountains. The stream is small around April.",Cristina Weaver
50,Great find!,"I saw the sign for Devil's Punchbowl on my drive into the mountains. It was well worth the detour.My first stop was the visitors center, a small spot filled with area animals, including many live snakes behind glass. I was reassured that it was too cold for them to be out on the trail. The staff directed me to the mile-long loop trail, saying an hour was needed.I was concerned about how much daylight I had left, so I pushed it to finish in 40 mins. That may have been a bit ambitious since I probably didn't take enough time to soak in the beauty of the canyon. It was a great workout though. I met some nice people who got me back on the trail when I veered off.Overall, make this stop. Lovely find!",UnionGirl
50,A Natural Treat,It is a beautiful place to visit in all seasons. We share it with friends when they visit our area. It is so much nicer than driving to the city to some amusement park! A Natural treat.,MoeFagan
50,A great hike,"This is an easy hike but requires lots of water, sunscreen, pair of great hiking shoes and a wide rim hat. There is not much shade here, must make it to Devils chair, it's we're all the breath taking views awaits!",Sugaylange
40,Great hiking spot,We love Devils punchbowl the terrain is interesting and varied. There is a small ranger station with some exhibits and a few different trails for different abilities. Interesting rock formations and lots of different plants.,JKPImageFusion
40,Fascinating Geography,"I went during the summer, which was a mistake, but still I was able to get the gist of the location, and I want to go back, when it's not so hot. It's fascinating geography, and I'd love to walk down to the bottom, on the trail. But when I went, it was way too hot.",mrliterature
50,Great Park!!,"Had an excellent hike here during the summer. We had a 10 y/o and 7y/o with us, they didn't have a problem. Hiked early in the morning, so the heat wasn't an issue. Be sure to take water. Trail not well marked down at the bottom, got off the trail once, but found it again without a problem. Kids absolutely loved seeing the stunning rock formations that the park provides.",GSD671
50,Devil's Punchbowl.,"Beautiful, wonderful serene park. We are seniors and easily hiked the mile hike into the Canyon. Will visit whenever we are in the area. Love the little museum.",Jill B
50,Hike in the San Andreas fault. Easy hour hike or more intense hikes into the mountains.,"Great place to see the San Andreas fault exposed. It's on my list of places to take people from out of town. You get to see the high desert, the fault, get a quick hike in...and if you are adventurous there are several hikes in the mountains.My favorite hike is to Saddleback ridge. Best for experienced hikers in good shape. About 14 miles round trip with some serious elevation. When you are at the punch bowl and look at the top of the mountains...that's where you are headed.the chair hike is a nice mellow hike. Good for a few hours with several places to stop for lunch.",philetos
50,Never Disappointing,"This place is always stunningly beautiful, especially in the snow!! Definitely worth even a quick stop for the gorgeous view!",Beth C
50,Amazing place,Just saw a signpost and followed it. A wonderful discovery.! We got a warm welcome and very friendly advice. Loved the display os snakes and animals and especially the owls. Nice walks. Wish we could spend much more time walking there. Hope to return again.,Tony C
50,Always exciting experience.,My kids love reptiles. This time snakes were awake. It is great to see them in action. The ranger is very helpful and friendly. He helped us to identify some lizards we have caught in the past to take a picture.It is best to go as early in the morning as you can if you want to roam the hills. Anytime is good for ranger's station.,ArtRussianMom
50,Rock on!!!,This place is just beautiful! You can hike around for hours or take a short scenic jaunt that is handicap accessible. Incredible scenery... the rock formations are majestic! Watch out for rattlers when its warm...,Doozer2015
50,Beautiful,"Wonderful hiking experience. The scenery is nice, and has a ""pre historic"" feel to it. I wandered around the loop trail (moderate level on some parts). Nice views and small stream was running. Popular area, parking lot was almost full when I arrived around 9 am. Lots of picnic tables and barbecues near the visitor center. There are some live critters on display. Good photo ops. youngsters will enjoy it.",J S
50,Great day trip from LA,"This is a fabulous place to see snowcapped mountains and huge Desert Vista is only a couple hours out of Los Angeles. It's a county park so it's absolutely free, and on our visit the park ranger was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and friendly.",Sharon S
50,None,Incredible views and opportunity for personal reflection and prayer. Be sure to stop by the Ranger Station to see the exhibits and learn about how the Punchbowl was created.,Mary H
50,Hike to Devil's Chair,"The round trip is 7.4 miles and takes roughly three hours to complete for an intermediate hiker. The first 0.9 miles from the trailhead is a gradual incline. Signs to Devil's Chair are well positioned. At the trail fork (take the left fork) the trail remains relatively flat until just after the 3.0 mile marker. Then there is a series of ups and downs followed by a decidedly descending trail. At the trail fork (again veer left) Devil's Chair is just another 0.2 miles. Once at destination, Hikers are rewarded with spectacular views. Take plenty of water and a snack or picnic. Fine for children who are experienced hikers, however, not advised for under 12 years of age.",Frank M
40,Great place to visit,Devils Punchbowl in Pearblossom Ca is a real nice place to take the family. It has a few hiking trails from easy to difficult. The one mile loop down in the Punchbowl itself is a little step at times however worth the struggles. The is also a nice little Nature center one can take the little ones to and see snakes and other wildlife from the area.,thibbs1955
40,"A ""Uniquely Desert"" Experience","The Devil's Punchbowl is a large depression that has two ring trails around the top and one leading into the basin. The site is one of the only places to hike in the AV and is good for a quick day long getaway. The wife and I went there and hiked the loop in less than 3 hours (we're hikers). Bring water as it is a desert environment and some water. Also, keep an eye out for rattlesnakes in the Spring and Summer months - stay away from them and they'll do the same. Parking is fairly limited, but you can park on the road leading up.",kbroski42
40,"Rock view and mid-length trail, get there early not many parking","The Punch bowl name, I get it, the short trail with 1 mile length is really a giant bowl-shape basin that's punched by some huge troll long time ago. Really fun and not that hard for any age. The rocks are easily to be explored and sighted in any viewpoint. And the Devil's Chair one is 3.5 miles long and take some time if you're not a senior trail walker. Need to pass nearly 1 mile dessert path, easy but dull since not so much splendid view and change. The following 1.5 miles is covered by trees and with view points along which makes it more pleasant. The last 0.5 mile is a little tough due to the slope, but totally worth it with the view point at the end. And there's also a spot not on the trail but I consider it as the real devil's chair since it looks more like it. Oh, don't forget to bring coat, the woods part is really cold now especially near sunset. And I think no need to say why it's important to get down before sunset.Get there early, before 11:00 I guess, just 40 parking tops, so~",Ying L
40,Unique rock formations and good hiking,"What more can I say? The rock formations are interesting and the hiking trails are great.... while out that way, stop in at Charlie Browns for some overload of schlock and kitch. And good BBQ.",HatCat44

50,Fun hike,"Great place to get a little exercise and beautiful scenery. I was just bored and had a couple of hours to kill. I have seen the area from the air and thought that I would check it out. I never get enough exercise so I thought that I would take the loop. It's an enjoyable hike and nothing too strenuous. Plus the price is just right, and I enjoyed seeing the snakes in the cages.",Bill R
40,Perfect nature setting near Pearblossom,"Up in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains, this gem of a park pacts everything you could ask for in desert flora and fauna. Great for kids, the 1 mile loop trail leads you through the punchbowl without much effort. Kids older than 10 can walk it. For the more adventurous, a longer trail (3.7 miles) will take you up to ""Devil's Chair."" The visitors center displays stuffed and live animals of the area, including Ruth the Barn Owl and several snake species, including rattlers in enclosures. This is a great destination, but bring water with you; the fountains were disabled during my visit.",Frank M
30,Interesting,"I was a little disappointed in Devil's Punchbowl. I didn't do a lot of hiking on the day I was there because I didn't have the proper footwear, but it just looked like an average place to hike.",Connie S
40,Great local hike,"Our family goes quite often and does the ""loop"" hike. Moderate trail that can be tough coming back up if you're out of shape. Takes about an hour if you don't stop and play at the creek at the bottom. It's free ! Water fountains and bathrooms are available. cool little artifacts in the info buildings there. If you don't hike, check out the owls in captivity and take some pictures from the great vista at the beginning. It will surprise you. Much more beautiful than the ugly high desert.",Enzo L
50,Hiking the Punchbowl,"Spent a great Saturday morning hiking through the Devil's Punchbowl. Beautiful place with some amazing geological formations right on the San Andreas fault. Returned a second weekend and hiked up to the Devil's Chair, a great lookout on the Pacific Crest Trail.",Wedgie01

40,Devil’s Punchbowl Natural Area,"A nice moderate hike at nearly 5,000 feet, take it serious and be prepared. Love the geology and the great views. Another SoCal surprise, this is an LA County Park, a bit rustic and that is the point of a natural area... right? Area was formed by the Punchbowl and Pinyon Faults and pressure from the San Andreas Fault.",DaveandKimTravel
40,Interesting geology,Devils Punchbowl is a natural bowl created by the intersection of two earthquake faults. There is a small museum at the site and several information kiosks. A long trail circles the bowl and a few shorter trails. There are not a lot of facilities but it is worth a stop if this type of thing interests you. The earth has been folded and distorted and it's good for scenic photos.,Kenneth L
50,Beautiful and peaceful,"Great place to hike, picnic and enjoy the beautiful scenery with all the family. We saw a desert fox by chance which was cool. Will definitely be coming back in the near future to do the Devils Chair hike and take advantage of the BBQ and picnic area.",Paula

50,best workout ever!!,i love hiking here def one of the most scenic and interesting workout you will ever have.there's a natural rock slide there if its deep enough def a fun drop.but be careful of the under tow.bring water shoes and sandals and dry clothes and a towel.you'll wanna get in that cool water on a hot day and you will need to dry off.after this hike my friends and i normally drive to charlie brown's on route 130 and grab organic produce as a snack :D,may0529
50,Stunning Vistas in Desert County Park,"Another jewel in the L.A. County park system that feels more like a national monument.This is a pretty fun trek to the edge of the high desert, right against the north side of our San Gabriel Mountains; while there are longer hikes mentioned elsewhere here, the main attraction is the 1+ mile loop that drops into the dramatic rock ""punchbowl"" formed by the San Andreas fault, passes by a gurgling stream, then ascends back up to the parking lot.As you walk down the switchbacks you get one great view after another of the rock uplifts, as well as up-close views of sandstone boulders, pinon pines, Spanish bayonet and (in season) lots of colorful wildflowers. Most of the times we go, plenty of snow is visible along the San Gabriels that looks close enough to touch.For the very small or disabled, there is a nice 1/3 mile nature loop right at the parking lot level which nevertheless boasts wonderful views as well as unique plant and tree species to enjoy.They have a great visitors center with friendly, well-informed young rangers who will explain anything you'd like to know about the live snakes, scorpions, lizards and ants they have on display. There's an interesting working beehive built right into the wall that you can view and hear; stepping outside you can see the bees traveling in and out of the building through a pipe high up on the wall.If you are fortunate you will be there when they have Ruth the barn owl out of her pen and perched inside the visitors center - you may be able to pet her (she's soft!) or at least admire her up close. Ruth is so popular she has her own Facebook page, and does a lot of 'community outreach' visiting local schools. If you add the Punchbowl to your Facebook ""likes"" you'll get alerts about the frequent star parties they have on moonless nights.Most people I know in L.A. have never heard of this place, let alone visited it - you should check it out and be one of the lucky ones! it's free, too.",SoCalRambler
50,Gorgeous and photogenic,It is a hike and one of the quietest places I have ever been to. A variety of native flora live there and the geological formations have been featured in many photo essays.,Linda R
50,Spot for nature lovers,"It's a great hiking location. My kids love nature center of Devil's Punchbowl. It has different snakes, some lizards, scorpions, bees, honeypot ants, some owls too. Naturalist is present at this center. First time we met a ranger over there and he showed us some pictures of his pets ""King-snake eating rattle-snake"". Last time there was a young guy who was very helpful and sociable. It's great scenery. Walking shoes are must. There's a picnic area near parking.",ArtRussianMom
