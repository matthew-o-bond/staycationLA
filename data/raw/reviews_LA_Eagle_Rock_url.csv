50,Haley Solar,"Eagle Rock’s boutique, Haley Solar, is merging sustainable fashion with accessibility in wear-me-now pieces all designed, manufactured, and sold under one roof. The new location offers extended class times for neighbors looking to learn sewing, pattern making, or work in our fashion design lab.Haley’s passion for the business merged with the artisan nature of designing is what has driven her to create a collection that embraces the customer and brings back the unity of fashion. Selling wholesale since 2011, Haley pivoted to retail 3 years ago in order to get back to small batch-manufacturing, sustainability, and her obvious love for her customers.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hereafterpr
50,Most amazing place to have a perfect sandwich.,"Although this place has a large and wonderful variety of cheese, they make the Most tasty and delicious sandwiches. From time to time they will have special events where they have a wine and cheese night, craving the cheese demonstration. If I had the time I would definitely come here daily for lunch. Don't forget to get a stylish apron, and cheese cutting tools. You can eat outside or at a long table in the back of the restaurant. they also have bathrooms. Do not think twice and come here to have an unforgettable experience.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/FrostElement

30,Why is this listed?,It’s funny that this is listed as an attraction or thing to do in LA. It’s a neighborhood and quite a decent one at that. It is quaint with many hills. I know there are a lot of Armenians here and my friend lives but that’s about all I know of this place.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
10,"sure, why not?","it's a fine place, but isn't close to LA, really. also, one time I went to look for a taco truck on the street that is usually there, but it wasn't. I ended up eating over cooked pasta at 3am.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/anniethemagnificent
30,Hmmm?,"I guess it does, if you quiet a wee bit, look like an eagle. It's also a nice middle-class and diverse neighborhood and good place toslI've and raise a family. Forget about the rock!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/CarmichaelVentura
30,I Live Here,"This is not a location, just a neighborhood but with some history. I understand it was the first neighborhood added to LA.It did not get a freeway enterance because Marlon Brando's mother was living here & wanted the place to remain peaceful.It worked as there are still lots of people who never heard of Eagle Rock around here.The Eagle Rock just looks like an eagle. I wonder about it as it has clearly been rolled into a round shape by water. But what water & when. I'm betting it was before the San Gabriels & the Verdugos pushed up.The character of Eagle Rock, I would say, is that of hidden attractions for college students, nightclub in the middle of a neighborhood, various businesses open half a day which apparently are only findable by the internet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JanettaS26
