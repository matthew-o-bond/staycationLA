50,Surf Watch,We enjoyed watching the surfers while on the beach. The hotel Surfrider has an amazing rooftop bar.. only for people staying there. Heads up,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Holdthebread
50,Best place for surfing,"I love this beach. It’s very beautiful, calm chill and great waves to go surfing or just relax and enjoy the view.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/418tanyab
40,Fun beach,This beach is quite busy. We stopped here along our drive up the PCH from LA to San Fran. We parked alongside be road where all the cars were and it’s free. The beach was a short walk. There are bathrooms but they’re quite dirty. The washing stations did not work. The beach was pretty clean and it was fun watching all of the surfers!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kellyduong
40,"Clean beach, nice waves and coastal views","My girlfriend and I did enjoy this beach as a stop on the PCH. It's very relaxing, has beautiful coastal views of Malibu, and nice waves for surfing or body surfing. The only negative was that once you get about waist deep in the ocean it's rocky, which is not as enjoyable as sand. Regardless it's a nice spot.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Jeffreeshen
40,Great surfer beach,"The surfing was amazing to watch. They dedicate a portion of the beach for surfers. The beach to swim was on the small side. It felt crowded even on a Monday. The access points from the street you need to walk down a sandy hill, which can be tough when carrying items. There is a pier right next to the beach with a cute shop, ice cream vendor, and Malibu farms organic cafe. We stayed at the Surfrider hotel and enjoyed the beach from their rooftop deck. We went on evening walks at this beach and did our ocean swimming for a day at Zuma beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/439ChrisM
50,Best Beach,"I love the beach, but this one really stole my heart, along with Santa Monica. It's just so peaceful. The food on Malibu Pier was absolutely gorgeous and I'm so excited to go back. At the end of the day, I sat and watched the surfers on the water as the sun went down and it was one of the best days of my life. I would highly recommend.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/949chiarak
50,Looking to bask in the sun(sand)?,This is the place to be if you want tranquility. Clean beach. No vendors. So be ready with your water and snacks.You can also play volleyball here. :),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Gerweiss
50,Summer is Best Time to Visit,"Visited during a Christmas holiday and waves and surfers were not out in full force however there were a few paddle boarders around the Malibu Pier which created an even more lively picturesque setting, especially during the long sunrises and expansive sunsets.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Charlesmdawe
40,Surfers catching waves,That was the most interesting on this stretch of beach. Some were just amazing at manoeuvring their boards with the waves. Well worth the stop.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Usia2014
40,Great spot to watch surfers and rent paddle boards and kayaks.,"Not the best beach in Malibu, but one of the better spots to sun, swim, eat and people watch. The waves are crowded so unless you can hold your own with the best be weary. Swimming is limited to the pier area, but typically it is calmer there so it is kid friendly. There are a few options to rent paddle boards, kayaks, etc. and it is really nice to get ""out there"" without having to lug around all the gear. Always an interesting crowd with great people watching and right next to the pier which has some really good dining and a few cool shops. Be warned, parking is a nightmare...",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/11adama
50,Excellent beach for swimming!,"This beach is pretty calm below the pier, so not a lot of surfers here and excellent for playing and swimming.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/HnossDesign
40,"Nice beach, but parking is hard","This is a nice beach - but as the name suggest, its best for surfers. The waves also mean that it's not good for kids. Also there are restrictions on where swimmers can go.Parking is hard, so come early if you want cheap parking.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Soren_Odense
40,Great to watch the surfers,I can’t surf and really wouldn’t want to but it is certainly cool to watch it. The waves were decent and many people knew exactly what they were doing and some not so much. It was fun to watch them all the same though.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/G3743BSdaniela
40,Another great beach,It's hard to miss the fact hat this coast is one fantastic pocket beach after another. Great job of preserving public access to the coastline,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Vonschmidt
40,Get a board at Surf Shack and Try the Tasty Waves,Great place to surf although try and get there early as there are lots of surfers later on and everyone is fighting for same wave. Great for beginners as waves aren't that large or if you just want to watch the surfers its a nice stretch of beach.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/J0hnPM10
40,Fun To Watch,We went here not realizing there was zero wading/swimming as it is strictly a surfing beach. That ended up being ok as it was so much fun to watch all of the surfers waiting to catch a wave. And when they did it was even more entertaining :) Beautiful sights all around and lots of pelicans too.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JenniferP315
50,Fun To Watch The Surfers,"When there is a swell, it's fun to sit on the beach and watch the surfing because the waves produce a long wave. This is also a good spot to look in tide pools during low tides.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/whiteshome1
50,Magic,"Great place to surf or watch the surfers riding the waves and understand why this 3-point break has contribute to create the Surf Culture. Tucked between the lagoon (with wild life), the Adamson House (beautiful museum) and the Pier, this little strip of sand is magic. Sometimes. the strong waves go over the sand strip to the lagoon. Great to see and chat with the old time surfers in their old motor home parked along the Pacific Coast Highway !",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RedSkirrel
40,Relaxed and a little cool,"Without being surfers, it is easy to appreciate this beach. So close to densely populated areas and yet so peaceful.The proximity to the Malibu Pier is a big plus",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Phayao13
30,The break has changed,i am old school and remember malibu from yesteryear. The break isnt what it use to be. a great place when not crowded to get a slow long ride if the swell is right. Not really worth the trek anymore as there are better spots along the coast to ride a wave or hang at the beach,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Marcthornton1
30,Awesome beach.... incredible wild life refuge,"This is a surf beach next to Malibu lagoon/wild life refuge. It is quiet and out of the way. No crowds on the beach. Surfing tends to be a little crowded, but long breaks and good for novice surfer. A nice place to hangout with friends or just solo. Pay parking by honor system.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WaltG_12
50,Visit Malibu Surf Shack for friendly service,"I hit it on a rare, quiet weekday and had a great time. I'm new to surfing and found this a good, non-intimidating place to learn. Leslie and the team at Malibu Surf Shack were super helpful and made it a day to remember!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/cflan22
30,"Crowded, polluted but iconic","Surfrider is crowded whether there is swell or not.Surfrider is polluted with or without rain run-off (drought but still dirty)Surfrider is iconic. I get to surf here several times each week (11 minutes from home)Everybody from wannabe and/or has been pros to groms and everyone in between. If you surf, ya gotta make your pilgrimage here. Follow courtesy and don't be a kook.Parking can be challenging. Just pay the machine and save yourself money",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Summerasalifestyle
40,Best visited around low tide,"This is one of the placed where California's surf culture was launched, with one of the longest/gentlest natural surf breaks on the planet. Just be sure to go around low tide so that you can walk the length of Carbon Beach down the coast from the pier.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Newsdoc
30,Not Great,"Went on a Sunday and everywhere was packed, not sure how this can e described as a quiet spot. Nowhere to park, eat or move! Surfing was miserable as simply too many people being very aggressive!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NICHOLASC562
50,"Perfect, low key beach!","Went to meet some friends at this beach today and loved it! Watching the surf campers learn to surf all day was great! Very consistent waves rolling in, but gentle enough for little ones to play in. Not crowded. Very friendly. We'll be back!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/396tonyah
50,Friendly people,This is a relatively small beach but I had a couple of nice conversations with some of the locals. They gave me some advice regarding moving out to California which was very nice of them. The beach itself was beautiful has a much different feel about it than say Zuma. It seemed a bit more crowded but I guess that's because it's better for surfing.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/623arjunr
40,Surfing!,"This is definitely the beach in Malibu to visit if you want to watch surfers! I'm not sure how they figure out who will get up and ride the next wave, unless it's just a matter of who moves first. Sometimes it appeared that they were going to hit each other when several were riding the same wave. Entertaining to watch. You can park on the side of Pacific Coast Highway instead of paying to park in a lot. If you're lucky enough to find an open spot!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TNHarleyChick
50,Great place to surf,This is a quintessential California surf spot. The people out there were very friendly and I never felt like an outsider. I will be returning here every time I come to LA. Rent your board from Malibu Surf Shack. The owner Sean could not be nicer and more helpful!,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ClintM490
40,Quiet and relaxing,"This is the beach to go to in Malibu if you want to take a relaxing stroll and enjoy watching the waves. We went around mid-day, there were few people and we took our time walking along the beach and lagoon.If you can, park on the street, the parking fee is pretty steep.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/733nathanw
30,Not bad...,"I've always wanted to surf so I made a point to check this out. The beach was cool and I liked that the swimming and surfing areas were separated by signs. What I didn't know is that the place that you rent your board from ""surf shack"" is a ways down the road, more by the pier. So after paying for parking I found out from the lifeguard I had to walk back down the road. And the surf shack let's you park at their place for free if renting a board so I wasted 6 bucks, no biggie. So after renting a board (the surf store workers were very nice) I had to walk it back which kind of stinks when the board is 11ft. I guess I was disappointed to find that the bottom of the shore was all rocks, and the waves were weak, so it was very hard to surf. I got up a couple times but that was it. Really thought since it was called ""surf beach"" the waves would've been bigger. But overall had fun. My girlfriend liked it a lot also. And they do have bathrooms but they are barely average.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dejaentendu247
50,This is Malibu at it's best,Surfrider Beach is a must see/experience part of your visit to Malibu. It is right next to the Malibu Pier and just a 15 minute walk from the Malibu Country Mart. Very scenic place with a lot of surfing history behind it. This is pretty much where the whole surfing craze started out years ago. Get there early since the parking along the PCH and in the lot next to the pier goes fast.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/craigjt12
50,This is Gidget and Moondoggy,"This is the essence of California surf culture. Yep, in the middle of some of the most expensive beach real estate, some board shorts, a wetsuit in winter and a board and its all a free ride here. This is a classic surf spot that gets some great swells and wonderful beach characters. its worth a stop.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SausalitoTravelGuy
40,Mostly good,"Been coming here since 1986. It's shoreline has changed a bit. There's less sand and the water's edge is closer now. Parking is tricky on the street. I have no idea how much the Surfrider lot costs, probably $10-$15, at least. I always arrive before noon, even on weekends, and I get a spot on the street. You may have to make a few passes and do a U-turn but it's very possible. The lifeguards can be annoying when they favor the surfers like they are to be worshipped. One time, after we had kids, I complained after surfers were heading in too close to my then young son at the water's edge. So, the wise a-- lifeguard walks over and extends the surfer boundary by putting the swim/surf sign farther over by my son, forcing him to re-locate, instead of warning the surfer(s) to be more careful. Generally, though, it a nice beach. Another year, my then 8 year old daughter was treated by a very nice lifeguard named Pat who paddled her out on his surfboard to the pier and he peeled her off a starfish, which was very cool of him to do. Surfrider proper runs into Cross Creek beach which has it's own lot and path entry. That abutts to the private Malibu Colony beach. Cross Creek has a stagnant pond that drains to the ocean at various times. Most times you can cross the running water and go over into the other beach.In the summer, it's crowded and there is a hot dog guy. Our ritual, though, is a 2 minute walk across the street to Jack in the Box, which I have been doing for 27 years! There used to be Malibu Liquors there to get a brown bag cold one, but it's been gone for years. There are a couple of food places on the pier but that's a different review.This is not the sprawl of Zuma beach. It fills up quickly in the summer and year 'round on the weekends. Great shell and rock collecting here at low tide. Of course, surfers and dolphins provide some interesting viewing, not to mention the lovelies on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/GaryMon
40,Make me wanna surf,"I'm no expert on surfing, I even can't swim. But views and atmosphere here really is a good pep talk for people like me. Maybe I should learn to surf here, right wind and weather.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/562yingl
50,Fun in the sun!,Loved surfing here. Even though there was a no swell the little waves were still fun ride. Get there early if you want the free parking on the street as it was full by 6am! Plenty of places to eat my favorite being Gladstones at Sunset with a drink in hand! lol literally its where Sunset ends at the ocean.,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gr8familyman
50,Surfers delight,"Although we are beyond the surfer age, it is still enjoyable to watch the young people tackle the waves at these three points. I marvel at how they are able to judge just when to accelerate through the wave and when to let one go by. Some of the more skilled surfers really milk the last gasp of the wave. Then, turn around and either dive under the incoming waves or ride over them.Looks exhausting to me as I sit on the beach with a glass of wine and watch in awe. There are so many beaches in Malibu that are accessible to families I don't begrudge one place where surfers rule.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/998JamesH998
50,Classic Malibu South facing beach break,"This is the classic ""Gidget"" surfer movie spot in Malibu. Easy break and a ""preserved"" surf spot. This is a ""surf-only"" location so leave the boogie boards at home. There is normally a mix of locals and folks visiting from around the world. Probably the most consistent working wave in Malibu with showers and bathrooms. There are hotels and places to eat located within walking distance. There is paid parking at the beach, however, it fills up fast, but not as fast as the free parking on the PCH.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/thomassG3669AB
40,Good Surfing,"We came here just to surf, so I can understand why other people may be put off by the area. It was a little crowded, but we still had a good time in the water. It is a clean beach with good restrooms, and I would go back again.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/JaxonB_13
40,Picture Gidget and Moondoggie,"Nice beach, clean, and with working restroom facilities. What's not so hot is that there are some homeless men sleeping there sometimes. It's not that anyone bothered me, it's that it's mind-boggling that in a community as rich as Malibu, people have to resort to sleeping on the beach.",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/AiZeeKay
50,Surfrider Beach Do's and Don'ts,"This world surfing reserve (first ever!) is fragile. Make sure you don't swim in the water within 72 hours after a rain storm. The homes in Malibu use aging septic tanks that leach poo and the like into the water table. A storm saturates the ground leaching septic tank goo and storm runoff into this beach. Even on dry days, check online for the water rating.A General Beach Water Quality overview by NRDC: http://www.nrdc.org/water/oceans/ttw/200beaches.aspDO enjoy the surf, but beginners, take lessons elsewhere, this is an advanced surf spot.DO wear/buy good sunglasses with UV protection.DO bring water in a re-usable water bottle. You'll look like a respectable local.DO reduce, re-use, recycle food and drink containers you bring to the beach.DO put money in the meter! (parking lot - free street parking)DO watch the surfers. These folks are amazing athletes and put on a great show.DO use the public restroom when you have to go. (not the ocean)DO stay on the trails in the marsh.DO check the tides, there are some great tide pools at low tide.DON'T COLLECT SHELLS. These are part of the beach and become sand eventually.DON'T be a kook.DON'T trash the beach.http://surfriderwlam.org/http://www.msasurfing.org/",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/annacapa
20,Surfing only at 3rd point,"I visited Malibu Point today for the first time in about 2 years. It's $8 on weekdays for the few parking spots in the lot that might be vacant, $10 on weekends.I found out that they no longer allow swimming and bodyboarding out at 3rd Point. The surfers have completely taken over the entire beach where bigger waves break.There used to be no surfboards allowed way out at the rightmost point, but I guess with the increased popularity of surfing and SUP that they have decided to give the surfers the entire beach.What a bummer!If you are thinking about catching some waves while body surfing or boogie boarding the lifeguards will kick you out of the water. I'm an expert body boarder and was catching some prime waves at 2nd where there were just a few other surfers enjoying the small swell, but the lifeguard kept yelling at me! None of the surfers had an issue with me and we'd actually been sharing the waves and talking about how clear the water was.They were also conducting surf camps there, with dozens and dozens of kids learning how to surf. It is a great site for that now. But the days of catching a few uncrowded waves are over for that place.It might be okay to try it in the early morning before the lifeguards get there but as far as I'm concerned they have killed Surfrider for swimming, bodyboarding and bodysurfing. RIP!",https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Orion_240
