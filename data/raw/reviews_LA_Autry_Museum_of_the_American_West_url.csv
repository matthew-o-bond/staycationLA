40,Field Trip Destination,"This is an interesting museum to learn about western movement to California. Volunteers set up carts around the halls to give visitors hands-on experiences. I've been here with three different classes for field trips and the kids all learned something. Usually they like the gold guns, panning for gold, and the hands-on stuff. It's worth a visit.",irsh21
50,Great Museum,This is a hidden gem.Didnt really know what to expect but this museum was fabulous. Visited with a 2-1/2 year old who also seemed to enjoy it as there was room for him to run and explore.,TG L
40,Much more than museum to Gene Autry,"Nice surprise when we went on New Year's Day as the admission was waived. So much more in the museum than information about Gene Autry. Articles and clothing from western movies, videos, and even an interactive ""horse"" to ride with a video in the background that was enjoyed by kids and adults. Nice restaurant on site, too.",Richard Hildebrand
50,Broad and Deep exhibits of All Things Western,"We had never visited, but I'm glad we did! Such a broad exhibit of the American West. From native cultures, thorough the settlement of the west, to the west in media, it is here. The quick tour was just that, but a goid overview of what's available to base the rest of your visit. And free parking in LA? Who knew?",Kathy B
50,Well worth the Money!,"Very interesting place of country cowboy stars' memorabilia. Brought back my childhood memories of Gene Autrey, Roy Rogers, etc. Some very nice exhibits and information about the time period. Only costs $10/person and Vetereans get in free..",John G
10,Highly dissapointed,"We went to visit with all the family. We did not find practically anything of interest! Apparently a few exhibits have been rented to other institutions and that is why they do not say much (for example some exhibits showed art work of artists we did not know about, and was rather boring). Overall, nothing I would recommend.",Fabian M
50,Native american art,"This is a well geared Museum for collectors and admirers of Native American Art. Quite extensive collection, that is on constant rotations. During the Art Market, it's a unique gathering of different tribes from all over America, including Alaska.",Gordon D

50,Los Angeles sight seeing locations,"Gene Autry was a pioneer singing cowboy and had an extensive career that morphed into owning a TV station, a major league baseball team (Los Angeles Angels) and numerous other business ventures. This museum is laid out perfectly and has an extensive exhibit of all of the history associated with Gene Autry and his career in western movies.",Anthony G
50,"Exceeded our expectations - handsome building, diverse exhibits","We knew the history of the Autry and it’s namesake cowboy movie star, but we were very impressed with the diversity of the exhibits - two (Fonseca and David Bradley) featuring contemporary artists with Latino and Native American roots, a very strong interactive exhibit about the California ecology, a predictable but interesting and rather insightful exhibit about the history of cowboy movies, and others. The facility is spacious and airy. The Museum Store is large and very well-stocked with Native American and Mexican sculpture, pottery, and jewelry, a nice selection of weavings, Western wear (including Justin and Tony Lama belts and Pendleton shirts), lots of books, and a sizable children’s section. Friendly staff, too. The events list is attractive, too. We were inspired to become members on the spot. Can easily fill an afternoon. Directly across the road from the LA Zoo in the northeastern corner of Griffith Park.",highway_song
50,Visit with my Mom,"Came into town to visit my mom, she being an artist she wanted to see a show at the Autry. We saw ""The Art of Henry Fonseca"" and ""The Art of David Bradley"" both excellent shows, well worth seeing if your in the area. The museum provides a very relaxed atmosphere.",Gregory K
50,Native American history,we especially appreciated Native American history artifacts this museum works hard to present to the public.,Rory
50,Excellent Museum!,"I really can't say enough about this museum. They've got great exhibits. I love how they showcase new artists, and they have lots of different exhibits on Native American history, horticulture, and of course Gene Autry, John Wayne and the like. Lots of Western history and Cowboy Hollywood history. Its very interesting and really not all that expensive. Much of their displays are donations from personal collections. It really is a wonderful museum.",123kariz
50,Excellent Museum with wonderful exhibits,"Wonderful building for exhibits. But, Why do the signs, info on the pieces, have to be so small. You need to be huddled close to the signs to read them and miss the beauty of the art while blocking others from seeing the sign or the art. There is plenty of room to make the lettering even 2 inches high. Then they could be read from a distance and the art enjoyed at the same time.",Christina C
50,Remembering the days of Gene Autry,"Opens up your memory of the early ""Western Movies"" with a lot of others in addition to Gene Autry. Exhibits and a great film.",Douglas T

50,Wonderful,"One of the best afternoons spent looking at original exhibitions about the American West. Educational, time well spent with a socio/environmental angle on the impact of white people in the West. I would gladly go again given the chance. Some nice interactive displays. Easily accessible to wheel chairs.",Catherine M
50,WHAT FUN! GREAT WAY TO SPEND THE DAY!,"Been living here for decades and am embarrassed to say that this is the first time we've come here in 30 years! Wow what a treat! First of all it is a beautiful, fresh, clean environment. The exhibits are well laid out and very diverse. There is something for everyone. I'm not much of a ""country"" fan - but the history, the art work, antiques and explanations, and all the presentations - gosh - there's a lot to learn and it all really opened up my mind! They have such a robust calendar of ever changing events, that I actually went back after purchasing and touring the museum, to the front desk and asked if I could change what I initially paid for as an entrance fee to an Annual Membership. Yup! I could...and I did!That also gives you a 10% discount in the gift shop that is probably one of the best all around museum gift shops I've seen besides the one at the Art Institute of Chicago. It also gives you 10% off at the restaurant which is right in the court yard and very nice. I noticed (for the next time) you can really get something to eat and then tour to extend the stay which is probably what we will do as the menu looked pretty good. This is absolutely a worthwhile place to spend a lovely day - rain or shine! Enjoy!",judysinger
40,"Good historical spot, NOT an art museum","Nice split of Western items, covering cowboy movies, Western performers , towns, stores. Good effort to include minority groups.Super collection of guns, esp Colt.Only a few paintings, sculptures, but those were of hi quality.Unfortunately, docent guided tours only on weekends.",travelroc12
50,The museum has many rooms full of old Western movie memorabilia,This place is a trip down memory lane for anyone who watched western TV and movies in the 50's and 60's.,Kenneth1955
50,Interesting and diverse,"The museum was much more varied and interesting than I expected. It had traditional exhibits of western history and artifacts, as expected, as well as exhibits about movie westerns, but also had lots of attention to native American culture, contemporary native American artists, the natural environment, and other things. I really enjoyed our afternoon here. And the staff was friendly too.",Glenn S
50,Authentic American West Historical Memorabila,"I'm a museum fan, and been to many all over world. And I rate them by how visually appealing their displays and the layout of museum are. For everyday people like myself, who have only casual knowledge about what they are looking at. The Autry Museum ranks high in what they curated depicting the American West. The museum has on display Buffalo Bill's personal leather field jacket.Along with iconic artifacts from the Wild West like a fully restored stage coach.Plus the original character costumes worn by 1st. Lone Ranger and Gene Autry too. Furthermore, if you have kids, your little critters will love this place. For locals, with a BofA account you get in FREE the 1st.weekend of every month. Likewise, for WellsFargo acct. holders it's FREE too on the 2nd. Tuesday of each month.It's a great place to check-out for tourists and locals alike. And while you're in the area, get a bite to eat at a locals favorite Giamela's Submarine at 3178 Los Feliz Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90039. Their hot sandwiches are big and tasty. A large sandwich is $11.25, stuffed generously to feed 2 people. Yes, it's a tad expensive, but it's MASSIVE. There regular is $1 less. They've been in biz since 1964. And a personal favorite since my high school days. Especially for anyone who lives nearby to Atwater Village / Los Feliz, & Griffth Park area. They have customer parking in small lot next to their store.Finally, if you aren't stuffed yet w/the Giamela's offerings. You can head over to Wanderlust Creamery on the main drag of Atwater Village at 3134 GLENDALE BLVD. LOS ANGELES, CA 90039. To get your fix on some seriously delicious exotic flavored ice cream. 2 Big-scoops in a cone will set you back $8+. And you'll wish I didn't mention this place to you. Because you'll be back to try all the other tasty flavors on their menu.",Joe A
40,"Interesting, but the less museum-oriented in the group weren't impressed.","It's small and has a disparate mix of themes and exhibits, but I really enjoyed the large exhibit on Western movies and the evolution of the portrayal of the west. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to win over the less museum-inclined in the group.",plsjustletmepost
50,Great Museum!,"This museum has great docents and artifacts from all aspects of the American West, from the Native people who lived here to the pioneers who came to settle. They have wonderful western art as well.",bkute65
50,Love this small museum,"Very nice museum with a western flair and exhibits with historical artifacts. The exhibits change and if you are interested in the west or Native American stuff, you'll like it.",vanchiro
50,Wonderful Museum,"Located across from the zoo with easy and free parking. Typically there are some wonderful temporary exhibits. And the permanent collection is worth checking out too. The staff is friendly. Nice gift shop. If you’re interested in western and Indian Art, check out this museum. Entrance is not expensive. If you have a Bank of America account or credit card, one weekend per month you can get in for free.",Nancy D
50,Truly Enjoyable,"Came here after a hectic day at Universal Studios, was just the right combination. Quiet, beautiful location, not too crowded. Interesting exhibits, a fun ""detective"" game for kids that kept our nine year old engaged throughout the visit (as did the gold panning on the museum grounds afterwards). Check the special programming -- we weren't there long enough to take advantage of evening programs, but they seemed to have an interesting line-up of things.",standerson
50,Interesting,"A big museum with very much to see. The museum has different rooms with different exhibitions. I found the art exhibitions not as interesting as the American West exhibitions. Here you can see authentic equipment from old movies, and also from ""real life"".",kajsa234
50,Fun for All Ages,"Besides great location, right across the street from the Zoo. This Museum has something for everyone, and the beautiful grounds, There are lots of exhibits and hands on things for kids. Beside the Museum's indoor exhibitions, it sponsors many activities in the evening outdoors, also geared to the whole family.",Michael M
50,great museum,happened upon this by accident and i was pleasantly surprised that i enjoyed it so much. a lot of western history and beautiful american artifacts here,GypsyMiki

50,Great museum for Western art.,Really enjoyed the paintings and sculptures depicting the old west. Should be included in any visit to Griffith Park.,Steve
40,Radio Plays and Western and Indian Art at the Autry Museum,"I've been to the Autry Museum many times and they always have a visiting art show with frequent outdoor events going on that all have to do with the old west - except for one attraction that I love see. SAG/AFTRA Radio Plays have been doing a few plays a year here for over 5 years now. They take you back to pre-television days with entertaining foley sound effects and the cast does the commercial breaks. It's a lot of fun - look for one. Christmas they usually have an evening of plays.Mics, actors and foley - they're great shows.That aside? This museum is great for kids or adults who've lost sight of where we came from. It harks back to the cowboys and Indians with profound exhibits that educate and inspire. Go see if you're a local or a visitor.The cafe serves very decently priced food and it's pretty darned good.",EMFredric
50,SUch a cool museum,This place is so neat. It is not just about cowboys but it is also about all of life in the west. About how western films evolved and all of the influences it has had on our life. It is really neat and worth checking out,kvmullett
40,Saw an excellent exhibition and stayed to tour the resident collections,It's very accessible and has a lot to offer. It's become a community gathering place for the region's native american residents with many artifacts and a resident theater company to draw attention. The information and memorabilia about Gene Autry and his era and movie genre; plus his business successes was very interesting.,LAchik
50,Incredible!,"We were not sure what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised by this museum. We spent 4 hours enjoying a wide variety of Native American art, items from the history of the western as entertainment, a huge historic firearms collection and the history of the west. The museum has tried to include all groups and provide information about different viewpoints. They are moderately priced and parking is free. This is a must see for any history/western/art enthusiast.",Lisa G
50,great museum,"My husband and i visited a few years ago, and really enjoyed the American Indian exhibits. Fun history. But the bookstore is amazing. Carry's titles you would see elsewhere. Very interesting and intelligent stuff for a gift shop. We will surely return.",Shuggiplum

40,Very impressive,"We came here without knowing exactly what to expect, but it turned out great. We spent about two hours walking around and i wouldnt mind doing it again.",Patrik H
30,Yeehaw,"This is a haven for cowboy- and western film enthusiasts. There’s lots of cowboy gear to watch - like saddles and clothes from western films. As a European with limited exposure to western films I recognized few of the references in the collection.There’s also an impressive collection of revolvers, guns and other sorts of weapons.I would not bring kids here thinking they will get interested in the old west. This felt like a grownup activity.What I appreciated most was the exhibition with art from David Bradley. It depicts how the native american culture conflicts with the ”white man” in an ironic tone. It was thoughtful and beautiful.A few of the other exhibitions made little sense. I didn’t really understand what they intended to let the guest experience. There was a lack of coherence.The museum is easily accessible and the architecture is modern and spacey.",Helena Ö
50,Offers an extensive overview of the history of the western U.S.!,"It is well worth a visit to this museum, created by everyone's favourite singing cowboy, Gene Autry! It offers an extensive overview of the history of the western United States, and details the many ethnic and social groups who live in that part of America. As well, it has a great giftshop, as well as a wonderful cafe which specializes in dishes from the southwestern U.S. Highly recommended!",arejaysee
50,Much more than Autry,"There is an impressive but small exhibit of Gene Autry, but much smaller than you would expect for his namesake museum. The list of sponsors included just about every famous western movie star of the past century and the exhibits are varied across all areas of the history of the American west. Hint: the first Tuesday of every month offers free admission for everyone and there are several senior and military discounts at all times.",mesatraveler
50,Amazing Show,"Went here to see a special show featuring the soundtracks from Enzo Marricone Spaghetti Western Films like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly series with Clint Eastwood, to celebrate a friends birthday. So much fun!!!",Baffo1
50,Superb Art Show and Museum,"Our horse club journeyed to So Cal to visit the Autry Museum to see the Art Show and the other exhibits at the museum. A group of 12 went and we opted for the self guided tour instead of having a docent guided tour. Having been on a docent guided tour in the past, I would recommend them to groups who have not been to the museum before. Our group had a mixture of first time visitors and museum veterans so we decided for us to go at our own pace. The cafe has very good food, though a little pricey but you get a good sized portion so it equals out. I had half a turkey sandwich and it was filling. I highly recommend this museum. They have plenty of diverse exhibits on display so keep an eye out for what interests you.",Jetk9
20,Disappointing - not what we expected,"We expected a museum that offered exhibits that gave insight into the development of the west and the movie studios and stars that gave us all the great westerns. Although there were some limited displays of this type of memorabilia, most of the museum is dedicated to various types of art, such as baskets and paintings. A large portion is basically empty. This museum has taken political correctness and environmental guilt to a level that diminishes the enjoyment of the venue.",Travel92253
50,Love this museum.,I haven't been here in 15 years. Loved the art exhibit and the new features of the museum. Thought the lunch menu was great. Would highly recommend it to my friends.,theatrelady
50,Full of information and fun,"I had been here 20 years ago and was glad to visit again. The exhibits are very well themed, with lots of artifacts and informative text. Although the history of different groups in California was interesting, my favorite part was the history of Western films and TV. The cafe was good, too--nice variety and moderately priced.",AnnBWMD
50,Wide range of Western History,"Went over and checked this place out after visiting the zoo. It only took an hour to hour and half to get thru. The top floor is mostly changing art galleries. The lower floor is history of the American West. It covers from the first settlers to movies portraying the west. They have several artifacts from chuck wagons, saloons, firearms, and everyday living. It also went into famous cowboys and Hollywood movies. If you have any interest in these things this is worth the stop. If you are a veteran or active duty you get in for free.",Mnako
50,Wonderful Surprise,"This museum was far better than we expected. Of course, the have fascinating displays about the history of western movies and popular culture, but they also have a wonderful collection of western art and displays about local ecological issues and the history of the West.",Larry P
50,Excellent day,"This museum is directly across from the LA Zoo, so why not hit both on your visit. Hey even though western motifs not my style I found it quite interesting after walking around the zoo.",Alwaystravel999
50,From old west to western art to western movies,"The Autry Museum was always one of our favorite museums to visit when we lived in LA in the late 1990s. It often featured interesting traveling exhibits plus fun items of the permanent collection of Gene Autry's memorabilia from movies, music and baseball. So when we were in LA in Jan. 2019 we stopped by. The day we visited was Tuesday, which was free admission. The new exhibit wasn't opening for a few days but we got to see our old favorites as well as a small special exhibit of western artists, primarily of landscapes. Museum shop has some unusual items too.",Liz G
40,Great place to take older visitors for like westerns.,"Took my visiting family and it was a great relaxing visit. Lot of interesting this about the the old west. It's also close to the Zoo, so it can be a great starting point before the LA Zoo.",liketotravel619
50,Great for Fifth Graders,"Every year I used to take my fifth grade classes from the school where I taught. They always enjoyed visiting this museum as it fit so well into our Social Studies curriculum. The docents were amazing. On another trip, I even took my grandson to it. He loved the jail and the chance to ride a horse statue in a movie. I retired six years ago, but would recommend teachers experiencing this with their students.",JerryFischer
40,Great Museum of the West,This is a great museum too go through in a couple of hours. The special exhibits were interesting and added much to the experience. The salad at the cafe was just mediocre and the kale was wilted. We had a very good time.,Jeannie D

40,Very nice visit,"We hadn't been here for a number of years...we weren't sure what to expect. It was easy to get to, the museum folks were helpful, senior admission was reasonable, lunch was good. We enjoyed the museum. Wished there were more exhibits on Mr. Autry",417peggyw
50,A Museum of the American Southwest,"This is not only for fans of Gene Autry (though I count myself as one), but for anyone who loves the Old West. There are extensive permanent collections and a few galleries for changing exhibitions. The theater puts on a program of movie Westerns on some weekends (check their website). The attached snack bar is fairly decent.",James P
50,Cool museum for California and Hollywood history,"Definitely a place for those who are interested in general history or old Hollywood. Might be a little boring to others, but if you're into it, they have really cool exhibits and tons of information.",Cris4412
50,I Enjoyed the Visit,"I didn't know what to expect from the Autry Museum when we went there and was surprised and pleased by what I found.First, let me comment that they offer free admission to veterans so if you're a veteran, make sure you have some proof of your service. I had my VA Health Card.There's a lot of painted art in the museum, which my wife liked, but I gravitated to the display of 19th Century weapons. Interesting exhibit containing rifles that I never knew existed (revolver style rifles).Other exhibits of equipment used in the American West was also interesting.Anyway, we spent several hours wandering through the museum and were interested and educated by what we saw. If you go in, as we did, with no preconceptions, I think you'll find things that interest you.",P Michael H
50,Worth a visit!,"We came to see the an art exhibit here and were very pleased with the artwork, mostly of Native American Indians of the old west. Beautiful. We also enjoyed the old west history in the museum itself including learning about Gene Autry and other cowboys and movies of that era. They have an interactive movie where you can be in an old western which is great fun! Good selection of Native American art including clothing, blankets, beadwork and basket weaving. I had read about this museum years ago in a magazine. Glad I finally got to visit it!",travelingCAgal
50,The place to be for California history ...,"It was a treat breaking away from meetings, what a cute little museum packed with information, everything you need to know about the West, the tour guide was outstanding with really in-depth explanation of California history.",Ana L
40,Enjoyable visit,"Admission is $14/adult with discounts for AAA, seniors, children and museum members. Parking is free. There are two floors accessible by elevator and stairs. If you like Western art and cowboy history and films, start downstairs. This was my favorite part. There is also contemporary art exhibits and a photography exhibit upstairs. These change during the year. There is a nice collection of Native American artwork, baskets and other pieces. The gift shop has a nice selection of items and books, etc. A restaurant is on the premises. We spent at least 2 hours here.",pasherry
50,I love this museum,Visiting my daughter I was very interested in two of the exhibits currently at the Autry Museum so we went and saw them. In addition to these two excellent exhibits the museum contains other fascinating exhibits. We were only limited by my aged legs and strength. If I lived in Los Angeles I would become a member most definitely.,caramello51
10,"This is an Art Museum, not a Western Museum",Hoping to see a Western Museum we were very disappointed when the first two galleries we enterred were contemporary art. Museum staff graciously refunded our admission charge.,easterniowatraveler
40,A Very Worthwile Museum,"The Museum offers much more than a tribute to Gene Autry, one of America's favorite cowboys. It features exhibits on West Coast culture. It is nostalgic to see exhibits devoted to the cowboys that were featured in the movies and television programming. They always have special exhibits. Our favorite was an exhibit on Route 66 that took place a year or so ago. Currently, running through January 2019 is an exhibition featuring Rick Bartow, a contemporary artist who was a member of the Mad River Band Wiyot Tribe. Ample free parking and, if possible, combine visit with a stop at the LA Zoo which is in the same location.",springpa
50,I love this museum,"I didn't love G.A., but he and his wife put money to good use. This museum is wonderful, really terrific programs and temporary exhibits. The collection of rugs, pottery, jewelry, is breathtaking. This museum combined with Museum of the Southwest (I believe), making it even more wonderful than ever before.",June L
40,Great small museum,"This is not a large - get lost in type of museum. We really enjoyed taking our time and seeing all of the exhibits. Definitely a ""jewel"" in our book.",firewalkerranch
50,Great Museum - Great Events,Really enjoyed the Salsa Night. Live band in the courtyard with dancing and free lessons! Also enjoyed the quiet exhibit hall. Wish i could have stayed longer.,Jamie W
50,Worth a visit,"Especially through December 2018, to see the Rick Bartow exhibit. He's the late American Indian artist from Oregon. Unbelievable work. The regular exhibitions are fine. Very interesting artifacts of the American west. Child friendly. Active duty military and vets get free admission.",sdog41
30,3 could be a 4 out of 5,"The Autry was a nice museum. The movie/TV memorabilia and gun exhibits get a 4 out of 5 rating from me. The art exhibits were disappointing. I was looking for art reflecting the early west and the expansion of the nation. Most of the displays when we went were more modern and were done by people from the west but I could not see anything in the work that captured the western spirit. Definitely not into the La Raza exhibit. That part of our visit got 2 out of 5, thus lowering the overall to a 3.I would still recommend the museum, just check what the displays are before going so you have the proper expectations. Also this was close by the Griffith Observatory so we tied the two together. The museum is also park of the LA Zoo complex also. Worth knowing when you are planning a trip.",Mark Q
50,History - Great Artifacts,This museum has so many artifacts! Great place to visit.Enjoyed the indoors but there is a beautiful outdoor area. Love the water displays!,sksaine
30,A very average museum but clean,"Its not a huge museum but its presented well and the exhibits are clean. It took about 40 minutes to go through the whole thing, there are some interesting displays but mainly feels like visiting an antique store as there are many old pieces of furniture and clothing on display, with not much mental stimulation. My favorite part was seeing Michael Jackson's glove and boots, and you can sit and watch an old black and white film that is randomly playing through the day.I ate at the on site cafe and it was okay, the food was fine but the service personnel didn't seem to happy.Parking is free and easy and its near the Zoo in Griffith Park so the location is awesome, however I wouldn't visit it again.",Ashley S
50,A Great Stop Off I-5,"This is a very nicely laid out museum with two floors of exhibits that cover western heritage. There are exhibits covering the early pioneers moving west, Native American culture, western sculpture and paintings. It includes a tribute to the Hollywood cowboy film and TV industry, as well as rotating special exhibits.We were pleasantly surprised to visit on a free pass Tuesday, plus no parking charge. A win,win for us.This museum closes at 4 on weekdays and we barely finished the exhibits the museum has to offer. Unfortunately the cafe and gift store were closed when we exited.This makes a great stop while traveling I-5. It can be reached by using the Western Heritage Way Griffith Park exit from either Northern CA or San Diego. It’s well worth the stop.",DIC267
50,Wonderful Western collection,"The Western collection here is first-rate. Both cowboys and Indians are represented and not surprisingly, there is a TV cowboy exhibit. After seeing a Hopalong Cassidy child's shirt on display that was not quite as nice as my childhood shirt, I donated my shirt to their collection, where they switch it into the display periodically to minimize damage to the fabric.",CaTraveler7777
40,Western art and gun,There is more to this museum than Gene Autry. A beautiful collection of guns with a great history of their manufacturing and use. I found the volunteer fire engine fascinating.,Bill7Nott
50,A Winner!,"Loved this Place! Great exhibit of ""La Raza"" currently being shown, great photographic history of LA's Hispanic community and their struggles during the 1960's and 1970's. The permanent exhibits were also very engaging as well as the outdoor native plant display! It is a doable size that we easily covered in 1 1/2 - 2 hrs. Pleasantly surprised at all the other events that go on there, employees give information about these events freely. Check it out!",LPinAZ

50,Great place to spend an afternoon,"Visited here last Friday afternoon. We’ve driven past the museum many times but never been before, so this place had been on our list for some time. This is a great place to spend the afternoon. Enjoyed the diversity of exhibits. The museum comprises two floors. The first floor had two particular exhibits that were very well curated – one related to the artist Rick Bartow with a real nice representation of his works. There was also the La Raza exhibit – thought provoking and an interesting slice of Los Angeles history. Additional galleries downstairs presented an overview of western history including the Cowboy Gallery, Western Frontiers and a few related exhibits. Having a soft spot for western history, there is much to absorb here. The gift store is well stocked with much to peruse at the end of your visit.",The Places Where We Go Podcast

50,Had no idea it would be so fun,"The Autry Museum isn’t just about the cowboy - although there’s a permanent exhibit dedicated to cowboys and westerns - but also has temporary exhibits on West coast culture. They have one currently focused on landscapes with paintings and sculptures, and my favorite exhibit was dedicated to the Chicano/a movement in LA from stories told by La Raza newspaper.",loveDCA

For October, the climate was dry and temperatures continued to be in the 90s. (We all know now the hot, dry weather led into one of the worst fire seasons in California.) When you travel by public transportation and on foot, be prepared with bottled water, a visor or hat, light clothing, and good walking shoes—and these days, a fully charged phone in case of emergencies. The Autry has lovely park-like grounds, across from the Los Angeles Zoo, and bonus, it’s the same bus stop for both destinations—just make sure you take the bus all the way to the museum/zoo parking lot, otherwise it’s a long, long hike. Anyway…from one year to the next, I’ve seen a number of the exhibitions as well as the galleries. From a person who loves the West, and loves the process of creating visual arts, I have to say I was a bit disappointed with Play! and didn’t “get” CA Cont’d. Maybe I was just too over-heated to appreciate the displays, but I think there could have been more intriguing things to look at. Sure, maybe less is more, but I found the same thing to be true with the Route 66 exhibit a couple years ago. There were some fabulous items in that exhibit, like the original typed scroll of On the Road by Jack Kerouac, but cool items were so far spread out that the impact was lost. The friend I went with to that exhibit loved it; I was like, Meh? (I did like the Jackrabbit Homestead exhibit by Kim Stringfellow on that trip.) Now, La Raza, on the other hand…was amazing. I was studying journalism and photography during the 1970s; the writings were so expressive and the images so gritty, so vivid—it was real life depicted. Freedom of the press and “truth in advertising” is a wonderful thing to celebrate. I spent more time in there than I did the whole rest of the museum. I know it was a departure from the common Western theme, but there really has to be WoW factor and other than La Raza I just didn't feel it on this trip.",Sabrina N
50,"Great Museum, easy location","We’ve meant to visit this museum for awhile, and with a couple of hours to kill before a flight from Burbank, we’re glad we did. From natural history and Native Americans to Gold Rush and settlers, this museum shares all of the history of the West, then the movie and music it inspired. Very nicely laid out, great local food at the cafe. A worthwhile LA stop.",Susan P
50,Well Worth a Visit - Again,"I hadn't been to the Autry in years and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the 4-5 hours I spent in this lovely museum. It's located just off I-5 near the Los Angeles Zoo, there was a lot of free parking the day I went, and the admission was reasonable ($14 for adults, with some discounts available). There is a pleasant mixture of genre', with everything from Moran and Remington paintings and bronze statues to modern Hispanic art, as well as film history and modern film connections.I hope to visit once again. By-the-way, the on-site cafe was good, reasonable and had a pleasant atmosphere.",mrliterature
40,A nice slice of Hollywood & the West for the entire family,"I visited the Autry just a couple of days before Christmas when family got together for the holiday in the L.A. area. I had never made it there on previous visits to the area, so looked forward to the experience. It turned out to be a nice afternoon for the entire family.Relative to other attractions in the area, admission is very affordable. Staff in the museum are very courteous, and security quietly rotates through the exhibit areas to subtly ensure that people aren't acting inappropriately or mishandling the rare exhibits being featured.Parking at the museum seems ample, though to be fair, it seemed like we were there on a quieter day relative to normal L.A. pace and crowds.There is a nice array of exhibits, featuring the life/career of Gene Autry, the West as portrayed in Hollywood over the years, western art, historical artifacts, and a large and historic firearm collection. The museum also features space for at least two rotating exhibits. At the time of our visit, there was a special exhibit on La Raza, and one called Play that more than occupied the time and attention of my six-year-old niece. Outside there is a gold-panning setup that is good for young children, as well as play area adjacent to the park. The gift shop is also very good, featuring a wide array of items that appeal to a broad audience.There is also a pretty nice cafe on site. It seemed that - even on a quieter day - they were out of stock on several items on the menu, and prices were (as expected for an eatery at an attraction) a little high, but the food was tasty.If there was any minor criitique, it was that I think I expected just a little bit more in terms of exhibits and items on display. I was a little surprised by how quickly I/we got through all the exhibits, even while taking time to look at individual items and read the displays.All in all, I was pleased by my visit to the Autry. I would visit again, especially if there was a rotating exhibit of particular interest. I would recommend it for individual or family visits; it is appealing to a broad spectrum of people, and of all ages.",Generic90
50,Always wanted to go here and well worth it!,"Easy parking,great exhibits and a real pleasure to visit. Really interesting venues for western history including Hollywood cowboys,western guns and saddles. A great collection of western art and rotating exhibits. Would go again for sure",Dave N
50,The Best Museum I've been too in Ten years,This was absolutely the best museum I've been to --I thought it was going to be all about Gene Autry but I was so surprised that it was all about the West and of course the western cowboy heroes and their films. The exhibits were so authentic and all the history was explained so well. I planned on being there for an hour and wound up spending over four hours. It was a perfect afternoon!BTW Veterans get in free,Bill F
50,Love it!,"This is one of our stops every time we are in Los Angeles. The area it is in is a very nice spot, right across from the Los Angeles Zoo. They do have an interactive exhibit that they change out every so often that is always a lot of fun.",Darcy P
40,Bank of America Free Museum Day at Autry,"Very well organized museum. Large indian basket and pottery collection. Rifle and gun collections and history.Special La Raza exhibit.Interesting history of American West and native Americans.Saved $20 using B of A ATM card for two senior admissions. Very nice hour long docent tours available at 11am, 1pm, and 3 pm.Cafe and store on sight.Native plant garden.Spent 3.5 hours.Free parking",margarita
50,Surprisingly informative and engaging,"I had mixed feeling about driving all the way to the Autry in LA traffic. Would it offer anything other than cowboy stuff? The answer was Yes! I was genuinely surprised about how informative and engaging the museum is. The history of the region is beautifully laid out. The environmental and social justice issues of this history were exhibited in an excellent and honest way. If you go, you should definitely have take one of the free docent tours. They last about 45 minutes to an hour and are well the time spent.",KeSuLu
20,Disappointed. Expected more of a western experience,"Appears this museum is dedicated more to other themes and artistic statements rather than the American western heritage, both historically and entertainment. Although there is some of this, it's not the majority of this facility and what there is has some artistic or political overtones. The displays also didn't lend themselves to the history behind the exhibits. Rather they tend to focus on the how, where or why the exhibit came to be. What also degraded from my visit was the ill-mannered, screaming, disrespectful, poorly chaperoned local grade school kids that overtook this museum. Lastly the gift shop......no traditional western/cowboy items to take home as a remembrance of the Gene Autry westerns era. What a disappointment.",WisconsinRanger
50,Worth visiting,We really enjoyed the layout and displays and we were lucky enough to go of Free Tuesday. Lots of memorabilia but also shows you a good slice of western history. Highly recommend.,rmbuck
40,I was actually a bit disappointed in this museum.....,"as I expected so much more. The place is well worth the time and effort but I suppose I am spoiled by our local western art museum as well as others we have visited at the expense of this place.Exhibits include--as one would expect anything founded by and named for Gene Autry and in LA--lots of Hollywood memorabilia and that is fascinating to view. Exhibits dedicated to life in the old west, fire arms, and Native American art are wonderful.Exhibits also include modern issues of the American west--particularly the LA area--including a touring exhibit on Latin American rights as seen through the Latin American newspaper ""La Raza"" and on the modern ""Chicano"" that make you think. There is also a section (outside) devoted to ecology and the use of plants by cultures that is quite interesting.",tencatdaddy
50,Ride the Horse,"This is a Gem as almost all the reviews state. We visited it when we were in LA seeing our daughter between Xmas and New Years. It is an educational, eye opening experience as to what the pioneers went through and also entertaining. You can ride a horse (not real) and the museum will supply the background. Its great fun for kids of all ages, I am in my 70's and Loved it. Its a must see in LA.",Rolandtz
40,An undervalued gem,"A really fine museum, focusing on the American west and only tangentially so on Gene Autry. Fine exhibits, very good art, interesting all the way through. Good parking, and right across the street from the LA Zoo.",bkane8
40,A good museum to visit,"The AMAW is a great place to visit. The museum is informative and fascinating. I liked the mix of ecology, religion, culture and history. The cafe serves a decent meal at a good price. My only gripe is that it took some effort to travel by the metro from Hollywood. Uber might be a better option.",PBM2010

It's a fun time for adults and even though it needs greatly expanding a fun time for kids with their interactive wagon part and a dude doin ropin trickery.Older visitors will marvel at how small Barbara Stanwyck's waist was, others will marvel at legends in photographs or by seeing their belongings. Wear comfy shoes and if you love yer little rascals mosey on over to the zoo when you're done. Happy Trails buckeroos.",Michael S
40,Good family museum,"My husband, our 3 year old daughter and I visited this museum in July 2017, it's a good museum for all ages, quiet visually stimulating and engaging, very representative of the history of the West. There are a few good spots for the kids ( fake horses to climb on, green screen with western film to ""act"" in, etc.., and since it's nested in Griffith park, the outside is beautiful, lots of space to run around before/after the visit. The reason my review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found the admission fee to be rather steep given the rather small size of the museum. They do, however, offer free parking.",Soha S
40,Nice museum,"It's a nice museum. It covers lots of different topics, my favorite being the film area. The costumes and posters, they are so neat to see.

At the time they were highlighting the civil way and man do they do great exhibits. The interactive portions of it were amazing, the quality of the exhibits were flawless, and the docents were very informative. We enjoyed the exhibit so much we decided to walk around the rest of the museum. It was a great museum, very interactive, there doing things outside ( I think mining for gold) with the little kiddos. Which they really enjoyed. I loved it so much, I made sure to donate, because its such a great museum, and I wanted to make sure I did my part for it to stay open. If you happen to be in the area, and want a quick date, or day trip.. I would check it out.",Alberto
50,Play Exhibit for limited time,"There was a wonderful toy and play interactive exhibit when we were there. We took our 4 year old there and he loved it. Much to see and do for little ones. I wish this exhibit would stay longer as we would return with him. A stage with costumew was included. We didn't find this until the end. Our little one loved this too.The rest of museum was also great. There were stationary horses, with cowboy hats, clothing, etc. One had a video camera with western music and scenes in the background. This was a permanent exhibit.Prices varied. My husband was a veteran and free. Seniors only $10. AAA discount.So, very reasonable day for a family.",Wanda H

50,Place to remember the old western TV shows.,"This was our second time there, the first time with our small children. That time we actually met Gene Autrey! It was so memorable that my wife and I decided to take some time out our schedule to visit it again. It was much larger now, with quite a few new educational exhibits, but the old standards were still there. Costumes and props from almost every old western star of the early days of television and the old movie matinees. A wonderful trip down ""Nostalgia Lane"".",EdinHawaii
50,"Smallish, but very well done.","For a smaller museum, this was great. A little bit about Gene Autry, some about westerns on TV and in the movies and more about the American west in general, but emphasis on CA. A good many older firearms used in the settling of the west. Warning - pretty cool inside! The cafe was good - a great buffalo burger - you can eat inside or out. Only negative, I'd have liked to have more info about Gene Autry. Depenidng on your interest, you could spend 1 to 3 or 4 hours.",brwerner
50,Great fun,"Pleasantly surprised to see this museum. It was clean, informative and well worth the visit. Great very every age group. Large enough for everyone to spread out. Interactive things for kids to do as well. Even a place to watch a little movie. Highly recommend this museum.",MrsAgiedc

50,Great museum of the American West,"There are things for every age group here. A great place for kids to play and reenact the western movement. As a teacher in CA, I took my classroom on annual trips and took my out of town family on visits here as well. There are usually traveling exhibits along with their regular exhibits. They've done much to improve and move away from just the ""cowboy"" displays and the pioneers to the westward movement and its impact on the original people ""Native Americans"" along the way. There is 1 cafe and a restaurant, I believe, as well as a nice courtyard area. The museum is across fro the beautiful Los Angeles Zoo and just a bit further drive is the AMAZING Griffith Park Observatory. Nearby hiking too. All so worth while.",Chi-Girl

50,Not a stodgy museum!,"Love this museum because the exhibits are so varied. On our last visit, there was an exhibit on play (including everything from American Indian toys to an original Barbie doll and video games) and an exhibit on the influence of the cowboy on popular culture (everything from a tricked out Harley Davidson motorcycle to movie posters and videos). The museum's collection is comprehensive and serious but also quite appealing to lots of different interests. The book store is a must see also!",kindeltfamily
40,Gene Autry has 5 stars on the Hollywood walk of Fame,"The museum is good for information on western movies, colt revolvers, for information about California native Americans, for a sample of plants that grow in arid land, and much more.There are ever changing sections. The museum is much larger than I imagined. We spent 2 hours in the museum with our friend who is a docent and he hurried us through to be able to learn what all the areas contained.When we go back, I think I'll start at the beginning and read all the movie posters and study the saddles, etc and not be concerned about how much of the museum I see. One could spend several days here.One can rest on benches; however, the museum could use a few more in some areas.Currently Play is an area for kids to see and play with ""old"" type toys.I don't think most children under the age of 10 would get much out of wandering the museum. However, docents make touring the museum a much better experience.Not counting time for lunch in the Cafe, I think 2 1/2 hours in about the maximum time one should plan. Plan to come again to see other parts of the museum.",Karen D

If you're in your 6th, 7th, or 8th decade, this museum will take you back to the days we were all glued to our black and white tv sets watching Gunsmoke, Roy Rogers, The Lone Ranger, and of course, Gene Autry. The museum presents a well balanced presentation of authentic museum pieces, (there's a remarkable weapons collection) and a terrific collection of movie clips, costumes, and sets from Tom Mix through Kurt Russell and Clint Eastwood. The museum shares a parking lot with the LA Zoo so you can spend the day enjoying these two attractions without moving your car!

50,A quaint look into the Old West,"Located in a lovely park, with other attractions nearby, the Gene Autry Museum of the Old West is small enough to do properly in one day, and is very family and ADA friendly.I am quite mobility challenged, but with just the aid of my rolling walker (they also provide wheelchairs if you need one) I spent 5 hours going back into another time that had very interesting exhibits laid out on 2 floors that allowed plenty of room for visitors of all types to enjoy at their own pace. The facility also provides guided tours 3 or 4 times a day, but I was visiting my adult son who lives in the area, and we decided to tour on our own with the assistance of a venue program.If you're a fan of westerns, John Wayne, Gene Autry, or just a history buff in general, I think you'll enjoy this museum and some of the interactive and innovative exhibits provided, including some photo ops for the kiddies on horses, dressed up behind bars in an old time jail, and you can star in short western videos that can be self taken. A lot of the visual interest comes from above, when you walk into an exhibition and the floor seems alive with a movie that seemingly comes from nowhere. Gun/pistol enthusiasts will be in Heaven, and although this is not usually an interest of mine, I was amazed by some of the beautiful weaponry on display.There is an outside area with a lovely waterfall to enjoy, local medicinal plants used in years past, and a really nice restaurant just as you come onto the property, with delicious (and not prohibitively expensive) fare if you come hungry as we did. There is panning for gold scheduled 2 or 3 times a day, and although we did not choose to do that the day we visited, it is also outside and the weather in the area is perfect for that sort of activity.There were families of all make-ups there, from infants to teens, and although all seemed to be enjoying the museum as much as we were, I would say that children of at least 10 and up would enjoy it more than toddlers, with seniors in their glory. Most of the exhibits were from MY era as a child (I'm 69) and earlier so I could share things with my son (42) that had nothing to do with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. :-) Plus, if you really want to get your cowboy on, there's a horse riding stable across the road, where the fee is half price if you pay online!",Priscilla G
40,Cowboys and fame,"If you are interested how the American west was actually populated, what it feels like being on a wagon trail, what dangers and threats you had to bear - this is the place to visit.

50,"Fact, fiction, fun!","Lots of Americana, as we went west. Hollywood has taken the dust, sweat, and hard work out of a grimy existence and entertained us very well. High quality museum with art, song, history all woven together. Don't miss it---good for one hour to all day!",skiNebraska
50,Wild West History,"When I was young, cowboys were my superheroes and TV and movie westerns were the best entertainment. The Autry Museum definitely showcases that aspect of western history, with costumes, posters, saddles, and guns aplenty on display. But it also tells the story of the real western migration and struggles to settle the western half of the United States. In addition to these permanent exhibits, there are galleries which feature western art, Native American arts, and visiting exhibits on a temporary basis. There are special areas with activities for children, and there are often live music shows or movies. A fine gift shop and a pleasant cafe round out the experience.",Suzanne E

50,Hidden Gem,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this fine museum. Although I have lived in southern Cal for 30 years, I never even heard of the museum until about a year ago. The museum covers the American West. It is not a biographical history of Gene Autry; in fact, he wanted the museum not to be about him.There are great exhibits including firearms in the old west, TV and films about the old west, villains, heroes, and a lot of great art. The building and grounds are beautiful. Great place to be if you're visiting the LA area. It is also conviently located close to the LA Zoo and Griffith Observatory.Also, we took an hour tour. The docent was very knowledgeable.",Fuzzy K
50,Great Memories,The Autry Museum has different exhibits throughout the year but the TV/movie cowboy show exhibits are great fun and bring back a lot of memories for 50's kids.,Dana V

40,Western historical museum,"Have been there several times, Enjoyed learning about the history of the Cowboys and Indians of years past. Special areas for children. They can play dressup, pan for gold,take a picture on a bucking bronco and listen to a docent explain about how the fur from animals had many different uses.Of course there is an entire section devoted to Gene Autry and Roy Rodgers.",vickiwinthrop

50,No better museum of the American west!,"This museum is extraordinary, especially if you're a fan of cowboys, American Indians, or the expansion and settling of our western territories. The last time I was there they had a special exhibition of Sergio Leone's western movies. And of course many gorgeous works of art. I highly recommend everyone to come learn why the name Remington is famous world wide, and who Maynard Dixon is. This is California!",Sanholding
30,Great facilities and may be sometime something as great happening there,"The disposition of the building and the space around it,courtyard and interiors are very impressive, but the collection of the museum especially the art section is very everege . May be when they have some special exhibits or some special movie showing it make sense to visit. It was full of school children and nothing really significant to see.",Lyuba T
30,Informative,"The Admission: $14 adult. With Yelp check-in, $2 off.The Museum: There are cafe, museum store and theater on site. This museum is two stories. Nice painting collections.

50,First Time,"We have been in the Autry Museum Store before but this was the first time we had gone in the museum.We enjoyed it completely. With a mix of permanent and changing exhibits we enjoyed the variety. There were several school groups which we were heartened to see and it seemed a major effort was made to keep them engaged and out of the way of other visitors.Depending on the exhibits, ewe would definitely go back.",phh26541
50,"If you love ""The Old West"" please visit","This is a lovingly curated museum. Classic era motion picture star Gene Autry, ""The Singing Cowboy"", has collected an amazing array of western art, film props, costumes and genuine old west items for your viewing pleasure. If this is your thing, don't miss it!",Wendor818
50,"""Our Western Heritage","Originally opened as the ""Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum"". The entire Museum is a tribute to our early American ""Western"" Settlers. With focus on Gene Autry's early years as a ""Cowboy"". Many other early Western Movie Stars i.e. John Wayne, Tom Mix, Clayton Moore (The Lone Ranger) etc. Roy Rogers horse ""Trigger"", dog ""Bullet"" (both stuffed) and jeep ""Nelly Belle"" are on display as well. Sections of the Museum are wide and varied, to include our ""Native Americans"". Well worth the experience and education.",Christopher R
50,A must-see place,"It's a beautiful place and along with all the Gene Autry artifacts they often feature showings and paintings from some of the greatest artists of both today and the past. My wife and I had such a good time we joined for a year, There is always something going on there and we go back often.",Pat B
50,Super Activities to Interest both Kids and Adults,"The museum covers the American West from many points of view--paintings and sculpture, the multiple ethnic groups that populated the West (including African Americans and Chinese) historical objects (guns, saddles, cattle drive chick wagons), exhibits on the ecology of California -- and, of course, clips of old cowboy movies from Tom Mix to singing and yodeling cowboys such as Gene Autry. The museum offers many fun things to interest both kids and adults, and it is uniquely Los Angeles. Plus the museum building is beautiful, the café is excellent, and the gift shop offers many unusual items. This is do-not-miss attraction.",Marc B
50,Wonderful museum.,"Upstairs is full of wonderful art galleries, downstairs is about weapons, and early West living. Both floors pay tribute to American indians, cowboys, and the settlement of california. One of the galleries is all about western movies. Great fun. Even the cafe was very nice.",debbieabbott1965
40,California Cowboy History,"An activity pick from my visiting parents. More history than art. If you are interested in western art & history this place is a great visit for you. A wonderful building, helpful guides. They day we went it was swarmed with grade school kids, but i think that is everyday. I found the Mabel McKay basket exhibit very interesting and my favorite exhibit.",L P
50,Fascinating visit!,"My son got in free because of his Bank of America card, my daughter in law because she works for the park service, myself for being a veteran. Only had to pay the $10.00 senior rate for my wife. If you're into old westerns this is the place to go. I can't even begin to tell you how much there is to see. A must visit!",Donald S
50,Yippee ki-yay,"Should be on anyone's list of things to see in L.A. Beautiful grounds. Staff was friendly and informative. Great histories told here. Really cool when they get authors and historians to visit. Even if you're not particularly interested in anything western, there is still enough keep your attention.",BadBlake
40,"Good value, interesting","They offer free admission with current ID for active military personnel and veterans, peace officers, and park rangers. They offer a AAA discount, as well as student & senior pricing - all of which make visiting affordable. Remember they are closed on Mondays.Over the past few years, they have really made some nice improvements to the museum and its displays. The displays are professionally done and are not ""hokey"" at all.I will say that between 10 am and 12:15pm, you can expect a lot of school groups on weekdays and then some of the areas will be closed to the general public during that time.It's worth a visit. Plan about 3 hours, if you want to see everything and not feel rushed.Located directly across from the LA Zoo, so if you want to do both in the same day, that's definitely do-able. Instead of the zoo, we combined our visit with the San Antonio Winery (for lunch & complimentary wine tastings) which is about 11 miles away.Cheers! :D",AvidTraveler507
40,Everything you want to know about Cowboy movies & more!,We spent a couple of hours here on LA's annual Free Museum Day. Now I know a more about cowboy movies & can tell Gene Autry from Will Rogers! I recommend following a docent around to learn more fun facts. I enjoyed the outdoor area with local flora too. There are some cool photo spots there.,lonestar21
50,A fun and educational experience,"In addition to Autry and other Western memorabilia, there are exhibits on nature and art that are both beautiful and informative. Active military and veterans are admitted for free (with a reasonable proof of service).",Cap93
30,Interesting Stop,Took my dad here to look at some of the old Gene Autry memorabilia. My dad was a long time fan and greatly enjoyed the museum.,CaribbeanFan79
50,Fabulous Art and Sculpture,"Before we walked in, we were hooked by the sculpture and description of the Pony Express rider. It is magnificent! The museum is surprisingly diversified, with exhibits ranging from Native American medicinal plants and artifacts to displays of Hollywood cowboy memorabilia. The art galleries have a range from the 1600's to modern art, all related to the settlement and development of the West. Remington cowboy sculptures are displayed beside Native American works for an unusual and thought-provoking experience. This is a wonderful and eclectic place and yes, I did ride the fake horse in front of the green screen with a stampede in the background. It was my 70th birthday and I knew it would be as close to a cattle drive as I would ever get!",Kate S
50,Not what we expected; better!,"If you want to see a brilliant collection that attempts to encapsulate some of the experience of the history of the American West whilst also doing some myth busting, come here. A much more balanced view and wonderful exhibits with plenty about the Native American experience as well as the ""Cowboys"" and settlers. SOme beautiful paintings and sculptures. Also a great garden with some Native American remedies",CassandraHolly

50,Autry Museum of the American West,"This was excellent. Very well worth the effort. What a tribute to the West a d the cowboy and western movies and series. Without The Autry, many western themes would be lost to upcoming generations.",mrsdrotar
50,Surprisingly great!,"Really didn't know what to expect, but there's something for everyone...for art, film, and history buffs. So happy we went.",Laura P
30,Decent museum....,"Spent a couple of hours here on New Years Day. Glad they were open. This was a nice museum, although far less western art than I thought they'd have, which was my main reason for going. Plus they had a very annoying alarm system in the art area that visitors were constantly setting off, which resulted in a loud, shrill alarm tone, but I could never figure out why it was going off and if I was the culprit-- there were no signs to tell you what to do and not do. I am guessing it was related to the paintings, but I don't really know. And it was going off constantly. Like I said, really annoying.The best paintings, IMHO, were in the California Historical Society Gallery, but unfortunately this was not laid out very well, with some paintings up high and one even stuck behind a giant plexiglass display so you could not view head on, and the lights glare made it tough to see at all. It's hard to appreciate a painting on a wall in the corner 8-10 feet off the ground.The lower level galleries were good but not really my thing. Nice collection of firearms. The photography exhibit was good. All in all a decent museum.",acadonnelly
40,Nice small museum,"The Autrity is much more pf an art museum than a museum of the west. Know that going in or you might be disappointed, `The gun collection could use some explanation of context. Overall a nice way to spend 3 or 4 hours.",mcarrara
50,Wonderful Collection of the History of the American West and Progress,"This is a small yet very well thought out Museum dedicated to the story of the American West from the early beginnings through the present time. Many interesting artifacts including some of the most stunning art work in the world. There is one of the most complete Colt Revolver Collections in the world including many of the presidents personally designed and awarded (i.e. JFK, Reagan, Nixon, etc.) Interesting for the entire family and a great way to invest time when looking for something interesting to do for half a day!",Sherri B
50,The Autry Museum offered so much more than we expected,"The ""Life and Work of Mabel McKay"" exhibit (about a Native American master basket weaver and healer) was so captivating that we didn't get to see all the rest of the museum. My partner was fascinated by videos of the history of ""Westerns"" in TV and the movies. And the f/64 photography exhibition thru Jan. 8 is wonderful. Everything here offers a different, fascinating slice of life in a place (the West) full of contradictions and change. Some of it is sad, but all of it is interesting. We'll go back.",Elizabeth H. T
50,Gene Autry Museum,This is a must see for people interested in Western history. The gun display is amazing. We did not allow enough time to explore the entire museum. Plan on being there for 4 hours or so.,susanfE2470LP
50,A gem of a museum across from the L.A. Zoo!,Went to a Native American Art show held at the Museum and was impressed with the show and the museum. The collection is first rate and the facility is very nice. The Museum features Western and Native American Art (older and contemporary) and offers many programs. The Museum store offers a nice selection of books and gifts. The cafe on site is very good also.Very happy with both visits over the weekend.,loesshawk2015
50,Worth the Visit-Has Some Priceless Items,"I stopped here on a Friday right at the opening time. There were several school groups also coming on buses that day. I had this on my list to visit as it was listed as one of the top 10 Old West Museums in the US. The parts about the Old West didn't disappoint. They have some items that are priceless like Billy the Kid's rifle, Black Bart's shotgun, Wild Bill's pistol and a war club which is believed to be from Sitting Bull. If you are a fan of the Old West this is as good as it gets. Many other items too numerous to list on display. Also displays on just about every single old west movie star you could think of. Even a display of Michael Jackson's western clothes he wore.They also had some art galleries that did not interest me and I didn't think pertained much to the Old West. Overall if your a fan of the Old West you won't want to miss this place. I spent a little over two hours here.",OnTheRoadAgain1056
50,"Nice Visit to Museum and Enjoyable Special Event: American Indian Arts Marketplace, Nov 2016",We enjoyed going to the Autry Museum of the American West.

50,"If you love the Southwest and Western Movies, you will have a great time","The Autry Museum is in Griffith Park, but not the easiest to find. It is not large and there are not a lot of great signs. Just make sure to get to Western Heritage Way and you will see it.The place is spotless and I have never seen it crowded. It is for Southwest lovers and lovers of old Western movies. There are great exhibits and not just of Gene Autry. There are Native America exhibits and some very cool movie exhibits.The prices are far and if you are a senior, they are great. Kids are welcome and will love it.It is not a full day trip, so go on up to the Observatory later. Have fun.",elizabethlascheid

50,did not get a chance to visit last year but was one of the first things on our to do list this trip,my wife is a huge western fan. was upset last year we did not have the opportunity to get to the museum. so this year was one of the first things to do. impressed with all the western memorabilia. especially the gene autry repeating cap gun - was made in a factory in my home town in ohio - but all the actual weapons on display from the old west along with clothes - horse tack etc was well worth the visit. being a vet my admission was free. thanks to the board for that.,tndawoods
40,Interesting exhibits,Called to see the Native American Indian exhibit but also enjoyed the TV/Movie Cowboy exhibit too. Being able to 'ride' with a backdrop of cattle ranching was hilarious to watch!,jars64
50,Surprised at how well done and fascinating,"Extra day in LA and went to Autry Museum. Did not expect much but it turned out to be one of the highlights of trip . Took tour with docent-- which added greatly to experience. An enjoyable combination of art, history and nostalgia.",ladybegood
50,Really made you think about the old WEST,Located off main highway. Small entry fee and lower for seniors..Well kept and very clean.. Visited during the middle of the week and the museum was close to empty. great for older folks who remember Gene Autry.,GARY W
50,A must do.......,"If you love the American Southwest, as I do, then this is the place for you. Fantastic displays, art and artifacts bought the old west to life for me. It's pretty good for lovers of westerns as well with displays of props from the days of Tom Mix through to ""The Hateful Eight"". Wonderful.",Marc L
50,Wonderful exhibit,Not only does this have great information about Mr. Autry and his time but also the era when he was around Los Angeles and Burbank,Andamy18
50,Great place for kids or adults,"The museum is divided into two perspectives......real old west and perceived or ""movie and television old west"". Beautiful collections of indigenous peoples' beadwork, actual blacksmithing and saddlery equipment and brutal, hand twisted barbed wire contrast dramatically with Hollywood set ""cowboy clothes"" and movie related merchandising displays. It's excellent! And regardless of whether your party wants to see actual Remington sculptures or ride a movie horse being chased by bad guys, this museum has something for you! In addition, there's a lovely native garden out in back.",leighlaughing
50,Great place,"The Gene Autry Museum visit exceeded our expectations in every way. It's kind of a mini-Getty.And very much to our surprise the food from the on-site cafe was five star - not fancy, but a wonderful taste treat. I recommend the Caprice vegetarian sandwich. The only museum we ever visited where the food was given the same care as the exhibits.And the price for 3 of us was $15.",MIke D
40,Autry Museum - Western Art,"We went to the Autry Western Museum last evening 10/1/16 for the Autry Gala celebrating California Continued. What a beautiful Museum with the new wings of the Museum featuring beautiful Indian basket Displays of the American West. Highly recommend visiting this beautiful and interesting Museum of the American West.The LA Zoo is located across the street, so it's a treat to see both.",Cathie P
50,Great sidetrip away from the LA crowds,"Anyone interested in the history and culture of the American West will enjoy this large museum complex, just a short drive from downtown LA. We visited when a substantial portion of the main exhibit area was closed for renovation, but it was still worth the trip. We enjoyed an excellent display of black-and-white photographs of the American West; a collection of California Impressionist paintings; and an ongoing exhibition titled “Art of the West” that included stunning bronze sculptures, paintings, and Native American baskets, pottery, and beaded items. A really distinctive and entertaining portion of the museum is devoted to the West as depicted over the years via radio, TV, and movies, including various “singing cowboys” and such old-time stars as Tom Mix, Roy Rogers, and, of course, Gene Autry, among many others. More up-to-date interpretations of the Western mythology are covered in exhibits on contemporary directors such as Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarentino. Visitors old enough to remember the many TV Westerns of the ‘50s and ‘60s will enjoy an array of memorabilia and artifacts, including costumes, pistols, and a page of the script--hand-written in pencil on a legal pad!--for the pilot episode of Bonanza. The section devoted to movies includes a space that explains how a “green screen” works on a film set: the visitor can sit on a stationary saddle in front of an actual green screen, hit a button, and see his or her image on a video display with a lively background of cowboys on galloping horses superimposed. Great fun for kids and their adult companions! And, in the “unexpected” category, a case of dazzling costumes and boots worn by Michael Jackson shows just how pervasive the Western influence has been in popular culture.The café that’s part of the complex offers a very nice lunch menu of reasonably priced burgers, other sandwiches, salads, and soups; and the large gift shop has a good selection of books, jewelry, art work (including original oil paintings--something I don’t recall seeing at any other museum gift shop), toys and games, cards, and other items.",Kamala4812
40,The there's gold in them there hills!,"Enjoyed our visit. We are still a bit jet-lagged, so this was a nice and not too strenuous outing.

40,Very enjoyable and relaxing place to go!,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this museum was to visit and tour. Not that I had low expectations - I'd been meaning to go given it's in Griffith Park and had been past it several times. I was just thoroughly impressed with the amount of memorabilia, photos, and good old fashioned information and facts it had. I find myself watching the History Channel and even old western movies and TV shows (Bonanza; Have Gun, Will Travel; etc) with a newfound appreciation and sense of nostalgia.",divisiblebyzero
40,Double The Visit,Everyone knows that Griffith Park is great to visit but what is not so known is that the Autry Museum of the American West is adjacent to it. Gene Autry is a legion to Southern California. See the early film making years of Hollywood. You just might also time it right to have a visiting exhibit.,Todd J
40,Worth a quick trip,"There are many great exhibits to see here. Definitely worth exploring! It's a bit busy on free days, but I would recommend trying to go those days unless you're a big Western history/culture buff. Admission is also free for Eat, See, Hear movie patrons, so check that out as an option too!",EmBentley
50,Sunday day trip,The museum had several exhibits to enjoy. The admission prices were very reasonable too. The photography was amazing and truly enjoyed the western tv exhibit. It was a great way to enjoy a summer day in LA. They also have panning for gold!,Linda R

50,"For a kid that grew up on western movies, I was enthralled!","I was passing close to the Gene Autry Museum and I had been wanting to go there for a long time, so... I did! After paying my senior rate ($6.00) I was inside the Autry at last. They had a wonderful photography exhibit with Ansel Adams and others. Then, I proceeded into the area with marvelous sculptures by Remington and others.It's not a large museum and it can be done in an hour. Once inside the Autry Museum, I found a beautiful sculpture of Gene with the title ""Back in the Saddle Again."" I also found stunning beadwork... not only in the Autry Museum, but also in the amazing gift shop. It was beautifully done and I was happy to have spent time here.",Ambersea

40,Great for Wild West fans,It is too bad this place is a bit out of the way or we would visit more oftenAll the exhibits we have seen here have been outstanding. It presents the historical development of Southern California and the South West very well with many cultural factions represented. It's a GREAT place to bring a family with kids. The director and curators of this organization are some of the best around.,roxskin
50,More than you can imagine in this wonderfully peaceful location!,"Contemporary art, antique saddles, Gene Autry's costumes, a horse made from car fenders and space to wonder, contemplate and think. Across from the LA Zoo this wonderful collection of art, historical documents, vintage costumes with TV and movie momentos make this a great place to spend some quality time.",Michael G
30,Small museum; for novices/kids or BIG Western buffs,"I visited this museum on a Sunday and joined a free guided tour. The tour lasted about an hour and focused mostly on the main exhibit on the bottom floor. The tour guide was perfectly adequate but the exhibits themselves (as well as the tour) did not provide any information that anyone with a decent history background didn't already know. The exhibit placards didn't provide any in depth information to explain the exhibits and from what I know there are no audioguides either. The target audience appears to be children or people that are just learning the basics about Western migration. The museum also has many child friendly, hands-on exhibits that the kiddos appeared to be very excited about.One cool thing about the museum is they have a lot of Western movie memorabilia and some interesting artifacts from the Gold Rush migration. On weekends they do guided tours which I would recommend since the exhibits themselves do not provide much explanation. They also had some type of sing-a-long of Western songs and the musicians were *really* into old Western songs complete in Western attire. In the summertime they also have movie nights under the stars and dances. I have not attended one of these events but they're free and from what I can see have great line ups. An hour, two tops, should be plenty of time for visiting. Free parking too.",Tanya M
40,Surprisingly Interesting,"After living in LA for more than 5 years, I finally visited the Autry Western Museum and was pleasantly surprised. It is filled with authentic western art and artifacts and is laid out in a convenient format for quick visits or extended outings.

Very helpful staff.,Betty33958

40,Interesting and Enjoyable,"The admission price was very reasonable compared to other museums in the area, and parking was free. We spent about three hours there. The exhibits are all about some aspect of the history of the American West, with an emphasis on the 19th and early 20th centuries. Everything is very well organized, and there are plenty of explanatory signs. The day we were there, there were several country or western singers performing in the main hall. We also ate at the cafe, which is accessible outside the museum. Prices there were reasonable (unlike the highly overpriced food at most museums) and the food was good.",Rosemary W

40,Movie cowboys and real Indians,"This museum fuses a permanent collection of movie cowboy kitsch (which is fun to see, especially with kids, but maybe not worth an entire museum) with a collection of Native American art, as well as temporary exhibits on things like Route 66, etc. Also, they have a gift store with the same eclectic range -- eye-popping turquoise Native American jewelry, side by side a faux leather fringe skirt. Always quiet, good place to go with kids!",AnonymousDragon

There is literally something for every one.",David_DeMulle

20,Maybe good for Sr. Citizens that are really interested in the old west,"Unfortunately we aren't senior's who are really interested in the old west. We had a groupon so it wasn't really expensive. My husband and sons did enjoy looking at the antique guns but if we had skipped this our trip wouldn't have been any less enjoyable. If you've done everything else in LA or are huge fan of the old west and old west art, go for it. Otherwise, I'd spend my time somewhere else. For the record it's a clean, well laid out museum. The staff was friendly and the facility is top notch. It just wasn't our cup of tea.",deltaduck2
50,Great place for people who love the west!,"We visited the Autry museum on a Saturday afternoon. It is in Griffin Park, right across from the Zoo. It has free parking and an admission fee.It is dedicated to the history of the west. It was established by Gene Autry, a forties and fifties Radio, film and TV Singing cowboy. There are several galleries in the two story building with different themes. Cowboy art depicted in sculpture, paintings and textiles. There is a lot of native American art depicted in paintings and sculptures.There are also galleries dedicated to firearms,used in the west. What I found most interesting was the display of memorabilia from cowboy movies and tv shows. The fifties cowboys like, the Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, hop a long Cassidy and many others. There is a broad display from actors like John Wayne to Clint Eastwood to recent movies like the hateful eight. Of course there are displays of Gene Autry and his varied career.The day we were there they had a bunch of musicians playing old west music and singing songs while dressed in western costumes. There was also a performing arts center and theater It was a good place to visit for a few hours. Very interesting. If youenjoy the old west, you would like to visit here.",Mazuza2

50,Western art and mofe,Great displays for Western art and sculpture. Native American artifacts and displays as bound. Great collection of guns and firearms.Loads of memorabilia of Western cowboysfro Tom Mix to John Wayne! Tons of founder Gene Angry personal memorabilia and artwork. Located right across from LA Zoo in Griffith Park. Great afternoon of fun and celebration of Western heritage.,Thomas P
40,More of an Art Gallery than a Museum,"The top floor of the ""museum"" is an art gallery that sells paintings and sculptures characterizing the old west..most all are quality but rather glamorizing of the old west..much like the 1920 movies the old westerns depicted.The sculpture exhibits were of very good quality.down on the ""2nd floor is the museum portion of the facility that contain a fair amount of artifacts and the refurbishment of the stage coach is a great exhibit""",LAFFSTOP
40,Excellent representation of the West,"This is an excellent museum. The exhibit downstairs about the history of the West is superb. There are many artifacts that show real life and it also goes very in depth about the history, and the story of the West. Two very interesting exhibits were the room about the different cultures in different parts of California, and the exhibit with the assorted types of guns, which went a bit over the top, but was pretty informative (especially for me who knows nothing on the subject). However, while the art of the west section upstairs was very good and thorough, it was not quite as good as some other art museums in the area, which also have sections on the art of the west. It did however have some interesting pieces, ( even for me, who doesn't particularly love art, and is obsessed with history) such as a large Native American Totem and Cross, and some interesting quilts, as well as some pieces on Metro LA. The two minor issues I had were: one, there is a lot of construction going on, so two of the exhibit halls were closed, and one huge murals, which looked like it is beautiful, in the downstairs grand lobby, was covered in a tarp. Second, there is no plain cafe, rather there is a restaurant, so if you want to buy a water, it is extremely expensive, and you need to wait for a waiter. All in all it is an excellent history museum, with a fine art exhibit, and a couple of minor pitfalls.",Yaacov D

50,More Than the Singing Cowboy,"Many people who have never visited this museum go (or won't), thinking it is a monument to Gene Autry. They could not be more wrong. The museum is dedicated to the study and exhibit of all things west. It is so good, my wife and I have been members for many years. Last year they offered an exhibit of Jews in the L.A Mosaic. A study of the history of the development of Los Angeles and the role the Jewish people have played in it. It covered history, personal stories, the changing relationship between various ethnicities as the city has grown. At our last visit, the lawn had been turned over for an American Indian Arts and Crafts fare with representation from tribes and nations across the country. While that was going on inside, there were readings of plays and skits in the theater. Our visits there have always been interesting and informative.",Victor N
50,Masters of Western Art Exhibit,Great museum promoting western art with some permanent movie and TV exhibits as well. The current show is well worth seeing. Great little shop and a cafe as well. There will be some fun musical events in the Summer. Well worth the visit...and the L.A. Zoo is right across the parking lot!,Jack C
50,ENJOY THE REAL WEST,"Having joined this marvelous museum when it opened, I was privileged to experience from the beginning Mr. Autry's incredible collection of memorabilia. What made it all the more exciting to me was the fact that years before it opened, I was Jimmy Wakely's music director, and thus had close contact with Mr. Autry, who insisted upon being called Gene. The museum reflects the class, as well as the desire to share of the man. It was an all too rare experience to visit something of this magnitude without the usual gaudy frills, and silliness that usually accompanies a topic such as our western heritage. If you haven't seen it, may I humbly suggest that you do, along with your children, grandchildren, and friends. Sadly, the current generation thinks of history as last week's episode of The Simpsons. This is an ideal place to show them that our country grew from east to west, through the courage and Homeric labors of our nineteenth century forebears.",Tony H
50,Great Collection,Saw stunning works of Western American Art. They also had the Gardena High School art exhibit which spans a collection of over 30 years. Great pieces by all the masters plus an assortment of Tv Western memorabilia.,Jim N
50,Not your average museum,The galleries are not arranged in the traditional sense. Each gallery has pieces from multiple disciplines and timeframes in order to create a conversation about a particular topic. This is really stimulating for discussion as a visitor. I was impressed by the programing they offer such as talks or artistic opportunities. Two thumbs up. If I lived out there I'd become a member.,Marshtackynut

There is also memorabilia culminating in seeing Gene Autry's actual guitar. Don't miss this throwback to the old west. It will surely bring back all sorts of memories, especially for those visitors born prior to 1960. Lunch in the courtyard is another treat!",John S
50,Amazing Route 66 Exhibit,My son took us to the Route 66 exhibit at the Autry. Such a trip back into time. They even had a classic car in the middle of the exhibit.

50,Updated and bigger than ever,"The Autry's American West collections were impressive even before they acquired the Southwest Museum's archaeological holdings. Now they are a significant locale for Native American history as well as the old (white) West. The interior and cafeteria had been given a facelift, and the fall Native American market is huge and of high quality. Highly recommended.",Techlady

40,"""The West is the Best... Get Here and We'll Do the Rest""","Another one of Los Angeles' smaller but worthwhile museums.The regular collection continues to evolve and the special exhibits are often very interesting too. They are very active supporter of the Native Arts. I have been to Pow Wows here (outside) and joined my Screen Actors Guild ""Native American Caucus"" for original plays in their theater. So they are active in the community and the staff is nice. I always want to support organizations that support community, especially when I get to enjoy works of art in the process.The kids will like the ""Treasure Hunt"" forms available at the entrance. And when they find the works of art and check them off, they get a ""passport"" stamped and a free gift. There are different places to put on western wear including the Greenscreen where they can ride a horse on camera through a stampede and other fun through the magic of video. It's in the same section where the grandparents can see memorabilia from their youth, such as the Lone Ranger Costume.I liked the Totem Poles, the sculptures, and especially the real deal artifacts like the historic guns, gambling tools, stage coach, fire wagon, bicycle and photographs.And I loved the 1948 ""Indian Chief - Roadmaster"" (because you cant tell the ""Story of the West"" without a big motorcycle!)I'm a sucker for museum gift shops. Mostly because they have stuff that is hard or impossible to find elsewhere, Like the Observatory and JPL have meteorite jewelry; the Autry has Native jewelry of Silver and Turquoise, and other themed gifts and books etc.. One can visit the gift shop without even going through the museum. There is a separate entrance right out front. So if you find yourself at the zoo or hanging out in Griffith Park, know that it is there for your shopping and/or browsing enjoyment.The entrance to the Autry faces the entrance to the L.A. Zoo and it is possible to do both in the same day, depending on your style (of visiting museums) and your stamina.FREE to the public on the second Tuesday of every month - Closed Mondays.Adults: $10 - Students (with current ID) and Seniors (60+): $6 - Children (3–12): $4 - Children under 3: Free - Free entrance with current ID for active military personnel and veterans, peace officers, and park rangers. And for Native Americans with Tribal documentation. - AAA members receive 10% off adult admission and Autry membership.",Bentheredunthat
40,Top notch and beyond just Cowboy Kitsch.,"I thought this was going to be Roy Rodgers memorabilia. It wasn't! Amazing stuff about life in the west in the last 150 years or so. Expert well written and explained displays in the exhibits, impeccably clean, rich in history, beautiful in art! Half the place was empty as they were changing exhibits but what I saw I liked so much I became a member for my birthday. The gift shop has some authentic Native quality items, a huge collections of books and plenty of fancy cowpoke stuff. What floored me was California Coastal Native American items for sale which are pretty rare to find in So Cal. Still not enough Native American History for me. Which they would put that up from the closed museum.",maddies m

40,This is a great place to see and learn about the history of the West,"The Autry Museum deals with the settlement of the West in very good detail - both historically and pictorially. The history area does deal with the Indians but another area of the museum features beautiful Native American art in many forms - silver, inlay, basketry, pottery, sculpture. We did the history part backwards and did not feel that the signage showed where to start; by the time we realized it we just kept going backward.Pay attention or ask - much is to be learned",westchicago
50,Great Museum and Indian Market,The museum is top quality western and Native American art. I enjoyed the exhibits and the Indian Market they had the weekend I went. They are the only place in the LA area to host one of that caliber and it was top notch! Can't wait to go back!,theladyknownascady
20,The Museum would have been wonderful had we not been hostage to a nasty docent.,"I visited the Autry museum on a private tour with my childrens' private school. In our group there were 19 children and we broke them up into groups of 3 or 4 students with a chaperone that was either a parent or a teacher. Our children are in fourth grade and are extremely well-behaved. I have twin boys and was put in charge of my two and two of their best friends. We were assigned a docent named Mike. All the other docents were just lovely -- there was one woman named Judy who had been a fourth grade teacher and couldn't have been nicer. But unfortunately, we were assigned to an autocratic, highly unpleasant and new docent on some sort of a power trip. As we entered the museum Mike looked at me and said: ""You will stay at the back and not speak. Only I will interact with the boys."" Are you kidding me? Who does this person think he is? The boys' mouths were open. Since I am not shy -- and since my children were involved, I told him I would do no such thing. My regret is that I didn't complain immediately and demand another docent. But since we were with my sons' school, I remained quiet. Inside the museum, Mike tried to engage the kids. But it was clear he had no idea what fourth graders know or don't know. His language was inappropriate and he refused to let them see what they wanted to see. He was, again I use the word ""autocratic"" and determined to be ""in charge"" of their tour. There was no going with the flow. I saw that the four boys were chafing and wanted to know certain things. Since I am the room parent in charge of one of the boys' class and extremely involved in the school, I also happen to know what they are studying -- and the tour was the culmination of their study of the State of California. Mike kept referring to ""the West"". Politely I said to him: ""Sir, would you mind to please explain what ""the West"" means in context of the map of the United States? The kids simply didn't know. He answered me thus: ""You are to be quiet. I don't want to hear anything out of you!"" The four boys were shocked. They looked at me with shocked eyes and open mouths. One boy -- my friend's son -- said to me, ""He is so mean!"" Mike refused to let the boys see the exhibition of badges. He also gave them misinformation and stated facts that were incorrect. Several times as he was expounding, I read the captions on the exhibits -- and in more than one instance saw that what he was saying was different than what the museum had put in writing. He kept asking one of my sons questions -- and my son kept pulling away from him. I told my son to pay attention and answer please. But then I realized why my son kept pulling away: the docent had horrendous hygiene and my son couldn't take it. The man was pushy, rude and disrespectful. How dare a person who is guiding schoolchildren aggressively try to embarrass and shame the student's or students' mother? The docent had no idea who the boys were, that two were brothers, and certainly did not have any idea or sensitivity to their level of knowledge or their interests. Nor did he care. His sole interest was to regurgitate his canned shpiel. Had I been the nastiest, most inappropriate mother on the planet -- it would still be unacceptable for a museum ""tour guide"" to point that out to that mother's children. Afterwards, I complained to another docent -- I was told that this Mike was new. Frankly I am simply horrified. Quite frankly, he was -- to put it politely -- unpleasant from the start. How he passed the museum's muster, I frankly cannot imagine. We entrust our children to people like this to help in their education -- and the school paid for the privilege of visiting here. The Gene Autry Museum completely failed us; it is incumbent upon the museum to vet their employees and/or volunteers -- especially if they will be interacting with children. No child should have his parent rebuked or embarrassed in his or her presence. I feel that my children, their friends and I am owed an apology. And until and unless said apology is received -- I will notify my childrens' school that this study tour is inappropriate for future classes.",jkaHD

50,Autry Museum - The natural beauty and historical horror of the early United States,"I visited with little of what to expect, I came away amazed at this little known museum.It holds exhibits on the Civil War, the many ethnicities of the pre and post Civil War Western states, the Mexican war and where California and other not-yet states of the west came to figure into the increasing conflagration between the Southern and Northern states opposed over the economics of slavery, the lives and weapons of cowboys, Chinese, African Americans and Chinese, the modern day culture of the Western as entertainment and film as well as modern day artwork of cowboys and native people's of this part of North America.To be able to witness at close hand the personal effects of General Custer, to see and hear anecdotes of the horrors and deceptions perpetrated against native peoples and Mexicans in these states at this time, all provided a thought provoking and thoroughly moving experience at what manages to be an epic and very personal look at these momentous events which came to form the current day United States.The gift shop is also a remarkable collection of stylish, eclectic and attractive choices of gifts, books and treats to purchase.One of the best museums I've ever visited.",Matt H

The place has guided tours, features galleries on Cowboys, firearms, western trails / migrations, and Native American cultures. The latter is second only to the Smithsonian Institution in terms of the number and diversity of their collections, having more than 30,000 objects.

We saw some superlative american works of art, learned and saw many examples of Gene Autry's long television career. The museum is sensitive to and celebratory of Native American art and culture, while also romanticizing Western ""Cowboy"" culture and music.There are things here for kids, too. At one end of the museum kids can participate in a video of cowboys on the range. There are also a set of instruments used to producing sound effects for television.",Tony B

Simply not true. Not even close. Sutter built the saw mill at the river he did not own; he did not own the river banks or the land nearby.And California never had slavery, under Spanish, or Mexican rule, and The California Constitutional convention of 1849, which Sutter's attended, stated that neither slavery or involuntary servitude would ever be tolerated in California.",Richard B

It presents the ugly truth of how the West got to where we are now: think of it as the best American History class you've ever had or wanted. Give yourself a good two hours to go through this one exhibit. Then, follow up with the other galleries on the main floor.",sfvalleymom
50,First Class,"Trip to the zoo leads you across the street to a great museum. It isn't a cowboy museum, but more of a true history museum of the 19-20 century.. Very clean and easily accessible. Reasonable $$",Jud J
50,BEAUTIFUL Native American,"If you are a fan of the old South West you don't want to miss this gem. So much to see a feast for the eyes. Beautiful Native American art work, regional tribal clothing,bead work,pottery and baskets. Plenty of free parking.",spfeismom
50,Out west,Great collection of days past in the wild west and beautiful Indian beadwork.A small fee and free for card carrying vets.,fergie1969
50,Always fun to go the the Autry,Always fun to go to the Autry. The western and cowboy films are celebrated and the Southwest Museum collection is integrated into the collection.It is much better and more comprehensive about western life than the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City!,Cavydad
50,If you like Native American and cowboy stuff this is your heaven.,"Great staff, friendly, free parking. Nice exhibits. Make sure to find the horse and green screen movie exhibit. Borrow a hat and duster jacket and you can be a movie star. It's fun. I recommend the buffalo burger at the restaurant. Eat it outside and enjoy the sunshine. There is a cool gold and mining exhibit. Cool store for souvenirs. Right near the LA Zoo.",idrawart
40,Great place to learn some history,"The Autry Museum is very interesting with several different galleries. Currently, they have an exhibit on California and the American Civil War. There is a heavy emphasis on the Native American experience in the war. The displays are easy to read (big print, easy content to comprehend), and there are several interactive displays which are designed for children, probably 4th grade and older. The museum also has a gallery of western art which includes a few Remington's, some Navaho woven blankets and textiles, and various paintings. Finally, there was a wonderful gallery of Hollywood's portrayal of the west in movies and television. This alone makes a visit to this facility worthwhile as there are clips of television shows and some of the original costumes worn by the actors.The only side note I would add is that the museum may not be interesting to very small children and the Los Angeles Zoo directly across the street might be a better choice.",Mary A
40,Very good for the history buff,Went here and had plenty of time for exploring. Only complaint is that they had a no-photography rule.,jJNB
50,Bi Surprise,"This museum was an afterthought for me, was there for a community meeting. What a surprise to be so enthralled with the history. Lots of 50's memories!",malibumaven
50,Lots of awesome History,The displays are sensational. The history of the American Indian and all of their rituals is enlightening. Well worth your time,JTD1
40,Worthwhile Western Experience,"Try to visit the museum every time a new collection is featured. But, always interesting revisiting the permanent collections, especially the Colt display. I'm not a gun advocate, but it's the most impressive collection of its kind I've ever seen. The Native American exhibit is also worth a visit. Lots of nostalgia surrounding the singing cowboy...Gene Autry's film history and memorabilia. Might interest folks to also learn that he once owned the Los Angeles Angels baseball team. The center is small by most museum standards, but has enough displays to satisfy Western history buffs. It's also kid friendly.",foodhoundBurbank_Ca
50,Western movie heaven,The Autry Center is wonderful! From the gift shop to the exhibits they show the history of the western U S and cowboy movies.If you are a fan of Gene Autry...please explain to your group especially kids on the history of Gene Autry and his amazing career.,sundog54
30,interesting,"we aren't much of a history buff family, we came to the museum to go to the Odd Nights at the Autry craft fair. The museum was interesting and informative, the location was beautiful! but the Odd nights was excellent, craft fair, food trucks, bands!",sld417
50,Love the Colt collection!,"Lots of neat Western historical memorabilia. For me, being the gun enthusiast that I am, the highlight of the museum was the Colt collection, especially the custom engraved M1911 .45 caliber autopistols.",TrojanSkyCop1
40,Western Nostalgia,"Collections of artifacts, photos, TV and Movie related items relating to Westerns, and Western history of the early 20th Century. Very well displayed.",Doug B
50,"If you love the American West, this is the place.","Do not miss the Autry--whatever exhibition is up, you can count on it being good. The Hollywood and the West permanent gallery is worth the price of admission alone. Great gift shop and restaurant too. I never miss the chance to catch this museum when ever I am in LA. It's nostalgic and reflective of the modern West all at once.The current exhibit on the Civil War and the West was remarkable.",corinnejoybrown
50,Excellent place in the spirit of Gene,The family makes sure to raise money to preserve the memories and lives of all of the cast still alive from Gene's era and to many other local worthwhile causes. Stewardship is everything!,willeverly
50,The Real West and the Film Industry,"The museum covers the settlement of the west including exhibits of buildings, clothes, and saddles. It also shows the influence of the west on films and how films shaped our views of the west. The upper floors have western art including Indian art. The rotating exhibits are generally excellent. There is an annual western art auction and sale.",MargieLA
30,A small but interesting display,"The museum is small but had s very interesting display of western firearms and native American beadwork. The museum touches on western movies from the silent era through TV to the current time. Includes Spanish, african, native American and European influences on the west and the lifestyle led by the people.",brenirish
50,Western Fun,Very interesting with lots of facts and displays. Everything from Saddles to clothing. Even a pace to take pictures and a beautiful setting as the grounds a re well maintained also.,Sherry C
50,An excellent museum,"We really enjoyed our visit. The exhibits were interesting, although some areas were being renovated there was enough to see . The cowboy film information was great, we had fun naming tv and film actors.",UlverstonJanet
50,You have to go here!,Great museum. Lots of interesting things to see. Not too crowded or expensive. I especially enjoyed the historic gun collection. a great choice. We went for the Route 66 display and loved the whole place.,Richard E
50,A great place to spend the day.,Although the Autry is in the midst of remodeling there are still many things to come see and experience. I cannot wait for the grand re-opening when the Autry will be even better.,4EIEIO
50,New items to see on each visit.,"The Gene Autry Museum in Griffith Park will entertain and inform for several hours. I have made two visits and have still only seen about half of the displayed permanent collection.As you enter the building, you will see their rotating exhibits and while I was there, I saw two that made it worth the entire price of admission.The first exhibit was of the iconic Route 66 and it place in the history of the automobile. There are photos of the places to stay, the unique sights along this special route. The second exhibit is slightly more specialized but spectacular none the less. It was floral beadwork from the 1800's through today. There is a clear statement of the iconography of the images that appear. Current designs are as intricate as striking as those of earlier years.The permanent exhibit is found on both the first floor and the lower level. It includes memorabilia of not only working people but also of the known and not so well known figure of the movies. You can hear their words as well as their songs. Starting from the age of film to today, there is a vast collection to see with each item clearly described.It is well worth a few hours for each visit.",NJTravellingfool
50,Best Museum Ever,"Museum covers two floors. First floor was a mixture of paintings, sculptures, and western/native artifacts including western film. lower level was also very interesting. Part of it was being turned into the new display ( Civil War & the West ) which opens April 25th. If you grew up during the black n white TV era with Gene Autry, Gunsmoke, Lone Ranger & Tonto then you'll absolutely love the displays and artifacts in this museum. Also a lot of western & Native American history here. Artifacts including guns, badges, clothing, a full bar and telegraph, steam engine, film, saddles, movie posters, This was the most interesting museum I've ever been to. Across from the LA Zoo. Don't try to do both on the same day. Hours are tues. througth friday 10 to 4. sat & sun 10 to 5. closed monday. admission is $10 adults, $6 students & seniors, $4 children 3-12. web: theautry.org phone: 323-667-2000",Tim G
40,Great Museum with Varied Collections,"So many different things of interest about the American West - whether your interest is art, cinema, Native Americans or other.Nice but small exterior space.Note that this museum participates in the Bank of America free first weekends program.Very easy to visit in conjunction with nearby L.A. Zoo or Griffith Park. Easy parking.",Annabella G
50,Hidden Gem in LA,This is a fabulous hidden secret in LA just off the 5 Freeway near the park. I happened to find it by accident but can tell you it is an excellent experience. Visit it when you visit the LA Zoo.,Whitakerh
50,give yourself time to wander around this place,The Museum constantly changes its theme - so sign up for an email alert to let you know when you may want to go back for a new showing.,mecoh
40,"Great art, history and western era movie props","••• Be aware ••• gift shop staff extremely rude and disrespectful to children and adults.Museum has a wonderful collection of American artist art. Most of them for sale also. Many in the tens of thousands. That should tell you the type of art/famous artist showing their work.Extensive collection of native american art, artifacts and history. They also have a nice collection of western era movie props.••• about the gift shop •••Many kids wanted to purchase books and toys. Stuff was yelling and being extremely rude to 8/9/10 year old kids. Who neither of them seem to be disruptive or misbehaving. I talked to the staff about them and didn't seem to care and carry on. Sad to see this specially as kids get a bad impression of museums.This museum shares their parking lot with the Los Angeles Zoo.",lxjuarez
50,Totally people-friendly museum,"I thought the Autry was going to be cheesy. Imagine my surprise when I found it to be the most fun, interesting, and people-friendly museums I have ever been in.First of all is the astonishing curatorship. We saw an exhibit of Indian bead work that was fantastic, partly because other museums had loaned their most gorgeous stuff.Then, this museum is the most accessible one I have been in. I am legally blind, and they made so many great choices. Such as: in the bead work exhibit, I could get within a couple inches of the items, which allowed me to see their detail. The labels are mostly in places where I could read them close up, and the print was not tiny. In other rooms, instead of putting the labels in the cases, they have reader boards stashed to one side, so that several people can read all the labels for the case, at one time. And, there are about 15 disabled parking places out front.Families with kids were having no trouble having fun, including sitting on a saddle in front of a green screen.The cafe has great food and helpful people, too.",barbgal
50,Big Surprise - Free on the Second Tuesday of the Month,"Visiting from the east coast for a week we took our nephews to the zoo in Griffith on Sunday. Directly across the street is the Autry Museum. The kids said they had never been there. My brother and sister-in-law, said they had never been there. One Monday night we had dinner with cousins who live a stones throw away and had also never been there. So on Tuesday morning we decided to go there. What a surprise to find out it was a free day - the 2nd Tuesday of every month!We spent hours there. It is an eclectic collection of western art, native american art and artifacts, California history (downstairs) and cowboy TV and movie history and memorabilia. There was also an excellent and extensive juried art show/sale when we were there. I wish there had been more info about the individual artists.There is a lovely modestly priced cafe outside in the courtyard.We went back and told everyone they have to go.Tip: Bring a sweater. It was overly airconditioned inside.",panamama
50,Masters of the American West at the Gene Autry,"This exhibit has got to be one of the finest juried art exhibits in the country with paintings by contemporary living artists who can and do get up to $200,000 for their masterpieces. A jaw dropping exhibit that features outstanding paintings of the American west, early western history including native Americans and cowboys, and extraordinary wildlife. We have made it a point to go to this exhibit for several years. The rest of the museum is also a treat with great exhibits of cowboy memorabilia, native American baskets, and western movie memorabilia. If the day is planned well, you can walk across to parking lot for a day at the zoo. You will need at least one hour just for the Masters exhibit.",Christie C
40,Western art,"Art sale ends this weekend. Great must see paintings and sculptures. Lots of memorabilia of Gene Autry and other Western movie stars. Western art and changing exhibits. I love this museum. Free parking,cafe and gift shop. Right across from the zoo entrance in Griffith Park",Priscilla G
40,Autry National Center,Opposite the LA Zoo in Griffith Park this is the museum that could! Incredible museum of all things Western: beautiful art and sculpture collection.,Suzan C
50,If you remember TV Cowboys- A must visit,"I am from the 50's and 60's era of TV where families could watch together and kids enjoyed playing Cowboys. This Center offers western art, Cowboy memorabilia from movies back in the 20's to present day, gun collections from way back- 1800's and many special events,just Check on the Internet. It is directly across from the LA Zoo and has easy access from.110 HWY. I really think it is worth the visit even for younger kids. I was awed by the size of guns carried regularly and historically it made stories more visual for me about Pony Express riders and stagecoach trips. Did you know horses wore snowshoes sometimes!!",101NDTraveler2013
50,A Must See on LA Visit,"Our car club arranged a visit to the Autry and had a wonderful time. The group coordinator was more than accomodating.She blocked off parking spots for us, gave us a group rate, & made suggestions for onsight cafe. We had Skip as our free hour plus docent & it was like a college history professor was conducting the tour. The cafe there blocked off an area for our group to sit together & the food choices were excellent. The art & artifacts on display are very impressive and you should allow a few hours to see it all. This collection is well worth your time.",srashford
50,Wonderful art and history,A fabulous place for people of all ages. The art is wonderful with different themes and historical perspectives focusing on western art and life. The gift shop has some of the best jewelry and western artifacts you will find anyplace. The food at the cafe is a bit disappointing although the service is good.,Ellen0417
50,Must visit museum,"So many wonderful exhibits to view and explore at this Museum which honors the West. Great for all ages and interests. Movie costumes and memorabilia, stagecoaches, firearms, old saloon, art, Native American beading - the list just goes on and on. Free parking right out front. Nice gift shop. Some hands on programs for children. Just missed Route 66 special exhibit, but they will have art coming in for 3 months and then another special exhibit later this year. Highly recommend.",AngelWandering
50,"""Western History Up Close and Personal""",There wasn't anything about the Center I didn't like. Many famous weapons and artifacts from the old west.,1VBKemo
50,Went for the Route 66 exhibit and we plan to return soon!,"We loved it. We had plans after the exhibit so couldn't stay very long. We had never been before and didn't realize what a cool place it is. It is bigger than we expected and there are great exhibits around every corner. Loved the design as well. It has one of the biggest and best stores I've ever been to and I've been to a lot! I would have bought some things but we visited New Mexico this summer and had bought several items we saw there already. If you live in the area and have a Bank of America card, it's one of the free museums the 1st weekend of the month. If you're visiting LA it's definitely worth the visit and give it a couple of hours. The LA Zoo is right across the street and is also nice while your out there.",Happy California Traveller
50,Top Notch Museum,If you like Western scene & all that jazz you must make a trip to the AUTRY!!! This Museum is fantastic the children love it. I had a great time & so did my friend & son,YardSaleLdy
50,"A very nice Museum, near L.A. Zoo","We went for the Route 66 exhibition, but really enjoyed the rest of the museum even more. You can walk the entire place in about two hours and see everything. There were some really great pieces of Western art that I enjoyed. They also have a fine selection of historic Indian clothing which was interesting to see. There is a nice entertainment section, with lots of old time Western movie nostalgia. The museum is directly across the street from the L.A. Zoo.",ZumaDawg
40,"Great visit, very nice food","Went today on the bus to the Autry Centre. It took a long time to get there as we are staying in Hollywood but the journey was really interesting. First we had an early lunch and the food was reasonably priced and delicious. There is a small charge to get into the museum but I found it all very interesting. I have to admit I knew next to nothing about Gene Autry but the museum dedicated to his name is full of fascinating information and artefacts. It tells the story of the native Americans who were often shamefully treated and the pioneers who travelled in times of great hardship. There are also several quite short films about such diverse subjects as the dust bowl years and the singing cowboys in films. It has enough to keep children, young and old, interested. I'm old enough to know better but I still got on the horse and saw myself in a film with cowboys galloping by. The bead work exhibition is excellent, and it was interesting to read the history and development of Route 66. We spent about 3 hours there. It's just across the road from the zoo, which I didn't go to, so you can easily spend a whole day in the area.",JennyLS48
40,Good but after a couple hours exhibits seemed like a lot of the same,"We were glad we went here because we love western history and the exhibits were interesting, especially the bead work which was beautiful with amazing detail. I guess with all the choices of places to go during our 3 day visit to LA, this wouldn't make the top of my list after our visit After going to a half dozen rooms of exhibits, it was a bit of the same (which it should be, it is all western history) but I guess I compare it to the next day when we went to Getty Center which I could have been at for 6+ hrs no problem. My opinion, if you love western history, are a cowboy at heart and are in town for a full week, this is a beautiful museum but if you have limited time, this wouldn't make the cut for me. I cant remember the cost but there was a fee which I am sure they list on their site.",JennyPeter
40,THE AUTRY,"We have gone to the Autry Museum several times in the past and it is a really good place to get the idea of western history especially the history of the movie cowboys.The beading exibit that is their now is excellant and wirth the time to see the fantastic beading the native americans did and all of the different stiles. Very well done and informative.We really went this time to see the Route 66 exibit. The exibit was very interesting and informative about the early history of 66 with some really interesting early pictures. Some of the information was repeated several times throughout the exhibit which became a bit repetative. We were really hoping for more information about current conditions and places to see but the exhibit focus is the history and not the current so we were a little dissapointed that they did not have more on after it was replaced with the interstate. Some of the old photos should have been enlarged so they would be easier to see as most of them you cannot get very close to. The 66 exibit is well done with some interesting signs and props and lots of early history. Good job and worth the trip if you are interested in early west travel, cars, motor lodges, gas stations or diners.We are going to the lecture on the Route 66 this Saturday which should focus on the current road and what is left to see. We hope to spend some time next year traveling the western parts and information will sure help finding our way.",707clayg
30,THE AUTRY,"We have visited the Autry Museum of the American West several times to see the new exibits. The main Museum is very interesting with quite a lot on the American Indians bead work and art and the western 'B' movies. This time the main exhibit was the Route 66 history that we were really interested in seeing. The exhibit was interesting but not as good as they usually do. It was a lot of the history but not as many artifacts and pictures of interesting spots on the route as we had hoped. Their was a lot of repeating the same text in different locations and the photos were really small, they should have tried to enlarge them so they were easier to see.The exhibit on American Indian Beading Art that is there right now is really good.We have been several times so now we only spend about 3 hours catching up on the new stuff. A first time visit will take about half a day to get a good look at everything.The cafe has really good food for a Museum at a descent price.I normally give this a solid 4 rating but we are going with a 3 this time as we were disappointed with the Route 66 display especially after all of the excitement and cost to put it together.",707clayg
50,Western Art At It's Finest,I went for the Native American Beadwork Exhibit and it was gorgeous. The building is in a great setting and nicely done. The museum shop is unlike most and has some beautiful pieces. The Bierstadts are my favorite.,AOneWorldTraveler
50,One of the best in the West!,"The Autry National Center is a real gem that far too many tourists miss. The permanent collection is simply incredible and gives the visitor a very nice overview of the history of the American West and has some great pieces, such as guns owned by Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickok and Wyatt Earp. The temporary exhibits are well planned and expertly presented. There is a great shop on-sight and a great restaurant. Plan on staying at least 3 hours and I don't think you will be disappointed.",Nils62
50,A real surprise,"After reading reviews on this site, we decided to visit the Autry Center. I have to admit we were a bit concerned when we parked the car. There's definitely nothing flashy about the outside. Three hours were set aside on our schedule for this place--obviously way too much time we thought.We found the Route 66 exhibit interesting, but having never lived anywhere near it, there were no memories to recall.Next we went to the Native American bead display. Here we saw bead work from present times and back a couple hundred years. Truly an amazing display. Just when you thought you had seen everything possible, there was another presentation from another tribe or another time in history.The main part of the building was for a history of the Wild West. We were amazed as we went from room to room of displays. They must have every gun that was ever used in the West. There was an excellent display of tools, gambling displays, saloons, and numerous displays of videos and books from Westerns. If this was the only part of the Center, we would have been more than satisfied. To summarize, what we feared would take half an hour when we drove in wound up being closer to four hours--and could have been longer. If you've ever liked a Western, you should see this place. We will be back the next time we visit the area.",ec0minded
40,Best place to learn about history of the west,"This museum provides a pleasant and informative overview on the history, culture and arts of the west. From native American arts to western films, it covers almost everything you would want to learn about the west. As a foreign-born California resident I did learn a lot during the 3 hours there.The route 66 special exhibit is a must-see! It probably sounds like another typical Route-66-themed display, but believe me it's totally different from everything else you can find on earth. This exhibit provides very detailed historic context, material and interactive media to help you understand the highway. It also covers remarkable novels and films including The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and the Cars (2006). Rather than putting a bunch of nostalgic items in a room, every part of the exhibit is organized very well.Parking is free. $10 admission is fair. Expect 2-3 hours here. May be a good idea to visit the Travel Town and LA Zoo on the same trip.",Jerome Yang
40,Hope you make it to the Route 66 exhibit,"It had been years since I last went to the Autry. The regular exhibits about the West as it was and as it has been portrayed are still a lot of fun. But we went for the Route 66 special exhibit, which was really well done. It's a nice blend of education and nostalgia. AAA admission just $6, which is a great deal.Also, we had lunch in the cafe and were pleased with the food there.",Deborah P
40,Route 66 exhibit impressive,Solid Western museum alternative in the SoCal area. Autry's direct and related heritage are well presented. Fun way to spend an afternoon. We've visited three times over the years. Recommend.,packcal
50,Love the Wild Wild West....,"If you loved the wild wild west and enjoyed the Hollywood Western, like Bonanza, then this is the place to go. You not only see the things from your favorite Hollywood cowboy, but you will learn a great deal about the famous Westward Migration. This is an exciting place. It is right across the road from the Los Angeles Zoo.",TonyaKeittKalule
50,The Best Burgers,"Juicy, flavorful burger on a soft, tasty bun. Do not recommend the red cabbage salad, but everything else is wonderful.",Adryan2013
50,Easy free parking and always excellent exhibits,"We have been here many times. This time the exhibit was ""Route 66."" It was outstanding. I loved seeing Jack Kerouac’s original manuscript for On the Road typed on a single sheet in the form of a scroll. Highly recommended.",MelWacks
40,Very interesting; worth the visit,"We weren't sure what to expect; we went because my mom wanted to go. We were pleasantly surprised with this nice little western museum. It's not limited to western movie memorabilia, but also has exhibits about different aspects of the migration westward. There is a special exhibit about Route 66 right now, also, which was very interesting. Local country western singers performed in an open area, and could be heard around the museum as we were viewing exhibits. Reasonably priced; 1-2 hours to see everything.",SB1114
50,Great place for a capsule view of the west and cowboys.,"The Autry Western Museum has grown into a very good western museum. It had started as mostly as a museum featuring movie cowboy exhibits. It is now expanded into more of a western museum with an emphasis on cowboys. There are still the displays of Autry movie memorabilia from the thirties, forties and fifties but now there is much more. Lots of stuff about cowboys, cattle drives, a big six-shooter gun display, a saloon and stagecoach. Also featured are exhibits about the Buffalo soliders, Spanish, in particular Californios,Chinese and gold prospectors. It might get a little boring for younger kids, (3 - 8). but there is a great hands on section were kids can try on costumes, touch different objects and play with vintage type toys. In the movie section they can also get a sense of what it is like to be in a movie.There is also a very nice art gallery featuring art of the West. And different changing exhibits. We saw the one on Route 66 and it was stellar. As an added bonus there is very nice cafe with good food at reasonable prices. None of the microwaved usual museum pseudo food. They have a great chili with lots of meat, good BLT and a fry bread taco with carnitas which was excellent.",Philip R
50,Wasn't sure about this one...was I wrong!! GO!,Not really into cowboys...but went along as I was a guest. Ended up asking to stay the whole morning and would have stayed longer if not for my flight that afternoon. What a beautiful place and world class museum.,FilRon
50,First rate museum,"Well kept up museum, interesting special exhibits. A lot of diversity, a really stellar gun collection, a good movie section lots of interesting western history.",Matthew J
30,Bello!,"The museum is nice, but it's mainly focused on the cinematographical vision of the American West. Many hairlooms and relics of the most famous actors of Western movies and not so much about the REAL American West. However, the museum is well presented and intringuing. A good introduction to West-Usa and its ""idea"".",Valex866
40,Beautiful Gem,We visited the Autry National Center today. I had never been there. They are showing a Route 66 exhibition presently. It was great. The fee to get in was $10.00 dollars but I have an entertainment book and there is a buy one get one free coupon you can use. The grounds are beautiful although I stayed inside most of the time because it was very hot outside. There is also a cafe where you can get sandwiches and burgers. The museum was not very crowded for a Sunday. The zoo is directly across the street. You can walk over to the zoo. I would recommend this museum to all ages.,Sungal43
50,A good time was had by all!,"We visited the museum with our 2 grandchildren, ages 8 and 10. The admission is very reasonable especially with AAA discount and ample, free parking. The Route 66 exhibit was very interesting with a special section on ""The Grapes of Wrath"" , which I had recently re-read. The green screen western was great fun for the kids. Two docents who had exhibits on medicine and old toys were very informative. Be sure to visit the lower level where the Chinese See family has an interactive exhibit where the children may ""work"" in a Chinese reataurant, wear theater masks and costumes from the early 1900's. You can pan for gold outside. We hadn't been to this museum for about 25 years, so we were glad we revisited it. The only downside was all the work on the 5 freeway which made our trip long.",kathy32954
40,Enjoyed being a hometown tourist,"Great little way to spend a few summer Saturday hours out of the heat! The parking here is free, Admission is cheap ($9 with AAA and free for BofA card holders the day we went). Current exhibition of ""Route 66"" was very well done and taught me a bit about my own neighborhood history. Don't miss the downstairs floor with its recreated saloon and bank vaults enveloping you in the Old West romance and grit. Really worth a pop inside! Can't believe I've never done this before!",Leigth M
40,Fun and informative,"This was a fun museum. It had plenty to keep our (10&13 years old) boys entertained in a fun learning environment. The best part of the whole trip was recording the kids while they rode a horse through the Wild West with the help of a green screen. It was hilarious. They had plenty of ""traditional"" museum exhibits as well about the west. They also had volunteers located in various rooms to offer hands on lessons about different aspects of life in the Wild West.",SuperTxMom
50,Don't miss this!,"I have been to LA many times and never bothered to go to the Autry. Foolish! Located in the northeast corner of Griffith Park, the Autry Center is so much more than a tribute to Gene Autry and other cowboys. From June (2014) to January, 2015, a special exhibit on Route 66 provides a fascinating look at what Route 66 and its travelers meant to our country. It features movie clips, fiction tie-ins, major collections of items, plenty of neon, and a sense of what it was really like. The other parts of the Center have Western art exhibits, continuously running Gene Autry TV shows, exhibits on how the silent movie stars became talking western heroes, and then evolved into the TV shows we all grew up on. The facility is large, clean and has plenty of bathrooms and places to eat. Bring the family. We were there on a ""Cowboy/Cowgirl Day"" which had many extra family activities. Spend the day here, you won't regret it.",bverbos
50,Visit this summer!,"Now is the time to drop by the Autry. Admission is $10, parking is free. There are also free docent lead tours.2 great exhibits are now on display. First off, ""Route 66, the Road & the Romance"". This chronicles the history of probably our best known highway.Also available is ""Indian Floral Design Beadwork"". So many beautifully crafted works are on display.There's something for everyone here. If you're interested in the history of the west, this is the place to be.Right across the street is the LA Zoo; 2 stops in 1!",tedandbarb
50,Amazing Collection!,"I was very impressed with the collection at the Autry National Center. We were able to see the Route 66 exhibit which was a lot of fun! I've always been fascinated by Route 66 and it was great to see such a wonderful collection. I loved all of the original cowboy exhibits. Everything from the Lone Ranger, Tom Mix, Wild Bill Hickok and on and on. They have dresses and suits and the stories of the people who wore them. The entire center is a real history lesson on how the West was built. I'm very happy that we decided to spend our day off from Disneyland at the Autry Center.",scraphappy256
50,A real western museum,"What a surprise when I arrive at this museum, thinking it was small and I would be here for an hour or so, that hour turn out to be 3hrs. There is a complete exhibit on US Route 66, one of the best that I have seen over the years, it is at the Museum until Jan4,2015, if you are in the area and if it perks your interest....you won't be disappointed . The museum is a great place for children's and adults and provide so much information on the west that it is pretty difficult to remember it all. right across from the LA Zoo, parking is free and the adult fee is $10. This museum has historic Western US display that is worth investigating. It is definitely under value for what it brings to the region. Great staff and friendly too.",joseph b
50,Of great interest to any baby boomer,"I was staying at LAX Hilton, on a business trip, and had a day spare to see something. I was going to visit the Getty Villa at Malibu, which is a favourite of mine, but changed my mind and galloped off to the Autry Center for the first time. I took a metro bus from LAX (an adventure in itself) to Hollywood Bvd. I am terrified of driving in LA.I loathe crowds of gawkers,and ambling herds of pedestrians, so I got a cab from there to the Autry. ($25). The cab driver had difficulty finding it, as it is not a place tourists know about or want to visit. (it is opposite the zoo)I arrived at 1.30pm and arranged to meet the cab there again at 4.00pm. First mistake.I needed much more time.Admission is $10There are two floors, and each floor is divided into different display areas. Every facet of the Western genre is covered. The surroundings are quiet, and the exterior is harmonious with a restrained gift shop.The sheer scope of the displays is mind-boggling. The sections with historical artifacts encompassed all aspects of the West, and were in the appropriate context. the display halls flowed with a seamless logic, and one item led to another in close association. There was an underlying balance, and all the stories were covered, sometimes with the one key object among the cluster of objects waiting for you to discover.(ie Wyatt Earp's Colt)There is a large section on Art of the west. Both 19th Century and contemporary. The contemporary exhibits are stunning, particularly the American Indian contributionsThe collections of film memorabilia were awesome. Any childhood wrangler from the 1950s-60s would have been well pleased with that section alone. Ditto the TV Western section. For me, 2.5 hours was far too short. if you are an affectionado of the genre, then go by yourself and take the day. There is nothing worse than seeing something like this with someone who wants to move to the next display. (Send them to the zoo).Cab fare direct back to LAX was $85 (!) but is you get back to downtown somehow then it is only $46. Whatever, it was worth every cent.",John A
30,Small but nice,"This is quite a nice museum. It is really for ""cowboy"" enthusiasts but when we went it had two other small exhibitions. There is some really nice art work and some unexpected items like Michael Jackson's stage clothes. Did not take long to look around but it was quite enjoyable.",Tricia B
50,More than cowboys,"This center houses western cultural history from the earliest times to the present in North America in the form of visual, audio, activities, music. Along with the permanent collection, several western related short term exhibits are also on display. We visited the Beading History-Native American Indians. This was displayed and explained in an historical progression in great detail.This center is spacious in layout and has an outside garden of native grasses and waterfall. It is great for all ages. The is a cafeteria and gift store too. The gift store items are priced very high and staff were not helpful and showed little interest in helping customers. The LA Zoo is right next door and so you can do both in one day.",19022013
30,Route 66 exhibit - good...but could have been great,"I loved the idea of an exhibit devoted to the history of Route 66. And the items in the exhibit were very cool. But I was disappointed at how small the exhibit was. There was one minimally sized section devoted to the Dust Bowl era. And while the artifacts, films and photos were wonderful, they were so limited in scope. The same goes for the construction of the highway. It would have been great to see more about the people who actually built those roads and the early vendors who set up shop along the way. There's so much history along that road. I just wish we could have seen more.",auntie-irish
50,Exceeded expectations,"I visited the Autry Museum one afternoon last month mainly to see the Route 66 exhibit. I wouldn't have gone otherwise, because I had in my mind that the Autry must be some kind of ""cowboy"" museum. Much to my surprise it is more than that. (Yes, there is some ""cowboy"" here, but it's well done.)The Route 66 show is fantastic! I recommend it not just for travelers to LA, but for the people who live there. My impression as I walked through the multi-sensory experience, was that many people in the gallery were in fact LA residents, who came to learn what Route 66 meant to their 'ancestors' who settled in California and had traveled that road west during the dust bowl years. The history here runs deeper than that, however, noting the late 19th century ""Good Roads"" movement that was started by growing numbers of bicycle riders. Post-war Route 66 may hold the highlights of the show for many. Automobile travel changed it's landscape so dramatically and in the 1950's and early '60s it became a permanent part of American culture.Regardless of how old you are, I think you will enjoy this show. Don't miss the little juke box where you can listen to 120 versions of Bobby Troupe's ""Route 66"".After Route 66 I moved on to the exhibit of Native American bead work. A gem of a show -- also not be missed. On the same floor are several galleries of paintings and sculptures that I enjoyed.If you happen to read this after Route 66 closes, I would still recommend you visit the museum. I certainly will the next time I am in LA.",pigeon33
50,First visit but won't be the last....,"We have been meaning to visit the Autry but were motivated to visit for the first time because of the upcoming Route 66 trip we will be taking in our RV and there is currently a comprehensive exhibit all about ""The Mother Road"" here. The exhibit is wonderful as is the rest of the museum. It is well laid out & can easily be accomplished in one day. There is a wonderful café, museum store and plenty of places to eat if you choose to bring your own lunch.....well worth the visit, enjoy!",cdenoi
50,Great Place to Learn About the West,"We went to see a special exhibit, but toured the entire museum. It was excellent. They have so many artifacts of the old West! It's both fun and educational. They even have Wyatt Earp's gun in their collection. It's easy to go through the museum and see it all in a couple hours. I was also there for a field trip a different time and it was a positive experience for the students as well as the chaperones. Docents were knowledgeable and entertaining.",zoofamily
50,Great museum,Had a docent led tour of the museum that was just terrific. Route 66 display is wonderful. Also Native American Beading display is beautiful,CAdreamers2014
40,What a nice surprise,"I thought due to the name it would be all about cowboys, Wild West..it was so much more. The beauty of the paintings, dresses, footwear, metal work, etc, so worth a visit.I thought we would be done in an hour plan to stay 3-4 hours to do it justice. If you have smaller ones a little longer to stop and have snacks and play.There was a farmers market going on in the am so parking was hard on the weekend, had to park across the street (not far).",Holly K
40,Old West Artifacts At It's Best,"If you like to watch westerns and like the old west, this is the place to visit. So many things to see, watch and listen to. There's a beautiful 3 wall mural that shows the history of the old west. The museum is not just about Gene Autry, but there is a section about him and other western / country singers. The biggest kick was getting on a saddle, and being super-imposed into movie scenes that the rest of your group can watch you ""act"" !! They also have a panning for gold area in the courtyard outside. Their coffee shop / restaurant serves very good food too.",K D
50,Checking out the old west!,"This is a great place to go to find out about the historical aspect of California. The Native American influence and all other cultural influences throughout history. Pan for gold, see life size statutes of cowboys, learn fact from fiction, learn about Route 66.This is a historical museum and do sign up for email updates and informational texts.",Sittinghen
50,Route 66 Exhibit,"I know, I know, this is my 3rd review, but you simply must go see the Route 66 exhibit. It has things for everyone. For adults it has the draft of John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" and Jack Kerouac's manuscript roll of continuous paper for ""On the Road"" as well as Memorabilia of the Mother Road itself. For the Kids it has a lot of Disney stuff from ""Cars"" as well as old counter Juke boxes and interactive videos we all got a kick out of. So go, ""get your kicks on Route 66"". Also take a couple of minutes and visit the Native American Beadwork exhibit..fantastic.",Skyros7
40,Great to learn about this country's roots,"This was very interesting for us as foreigners: Route 66, the development of the west, living conditions in the early times in the west, and so on. Many authentic exhibits. You could spend at least 4 hours. Be aware that the museum closes at 4 pm. Also, the observatory can not be accessed through the park, you have to drive around. If you need a map you can get one at the visitor center which is very small and a little hidden: take a turn from Crystal Springs Dr to Griffith Park Dr and you will see it on the left.",Carlos C
50,What a Fabulous Place,"First of all, parking is free and admission only $10 for adults and $6 for Seniors! This place is wonderful. It's educational. It's entertaining. It's interesting. It even has a cafe serving decent food at respectable prices. During our first visit to California we visited many sites and places that we probably will never bother to see again but not the Autrey. I don't think I could ever tire of this place and I'm quite an old man. That said, there's plenty to keep kids busy including (when we visited) an opportunity to pan for ""gold"". I learned more about the origins of America, the native American people, the Wild West and Hollywood's version of events that I thought possible. I'll be back",alanpfc
50,Still great over a decade later,"I remember visiting the Autry Museum as a child and loving it, so this year for my birthday my husband surprised me with a repeat visit as an adult. It was just as fun as I remembered it! So many great exhibits, from the early days of California to amazing Hollywood memorabilia. The day we visited they had some great interactive centers set out for the kids, like painting and clay work. Make sure you make a stop to pan for gold! This visit only took us a few hours, and had we had more energy we would have headed across the street to visit the Los Angeles Zoo in the afternoon.",OliveOyl2001
50,Excellent museum of the history of the US west,"This museum has extensive collections of American Indian bead work, western saddlery, firearms, and related cowboy and American Indian artifacts. It has details of the various cattle drive trails and how these influenced the growth of the US West. Outside of the Smithsonian, NRA museum, and the Cody Museum, it has what must be the most extensive collection of Colt and Winchester firearms. It is also a member of the museum consortium that includes the Cody Museum, so admittance is free if you are a member of any of those museums.",Mark and Jane L
40,a nice place to discover the history of the West,"This place has large amount of historic pieces tp illustrate US history and especially how the West was won: people, culture, gambilng, guns, transportation, indians. it also has spaces for kids where they can dress-up and play and an outdoor patio illustrating the gold rush",Parvatee37
50,A Terrific Western-Style Museum,"The Autry is a real treat which brings the attitude and history of the West to a normally stodgy museum setting. Visit, stroll, learn, and bring the kids for a very nice outing.",feiden
50,A slice of the West!,"Interested in historic saddles, firearms, paintings? Come here. Interested in the early western movie genre? Come here. Interested in serious reflections on the west, and slices of life living in the wild west or driving cattle? Come here. They have permanent displays covering all the above that are all very well done and enjoyable by school age kids up to us seniors! And the temporary displays are great, with the one I viewed being on the bead work of the Native Americans. Very exquisite work with beautiful pieces on display.",george p
50,Blast at Autry western museum,"Back when ""blast"" was still a cool term, westerns reigned supreme on TV and in the theaters. The Gene Autry Western Museum (Autry National Center) is an awesome venue to see the history of the American (south)west, especially as it pertains to film and TV.",Jerry Crawford
50,"I HAD NO INTEREST IN THIS MUSEUM, BUT WAS DRAGGED HERE...","And wasn't I lucky!It's an outstanding museum, worth visiting for the Remingtons alone. It has easy parking, It's very well laid out and has terrific paintings.You may not think you're interested in the history of the Old West, but in this museum you'll quickly discover that you are!",Francis M
50,Cowboys and Indians Museum,"If you want to learn more about the history of the American west, this is the museum for you. The stuff about namesake Gene Autry is ok, but it's the real history you will find most interestins.",TravelinAlan
30,It Could Be Better,"I've been to the Autry several times for special exhibits and continue to be disappointed. The permanent collection is okay, but really only worth one visit. The special exhibits are often in spaces much too large for the number of objects, and frequently lit very poorly, even for a museum. The docents are usually well informed, so it's worth visiting when you can do a tour.",RabbiWendy
40,Great place for kids,"THere is a wonderful courtyard in the center--although we hear this replica of a canyon in a cowboy movie may be removed. Some days you can ""pan for gold"". There is a life size horse replica children can mount. The real deal is the exhibit where you can put yourself in a cowboy movie. a little tricky to figure out how to film it on your camera/phone but so much fun. Props available A remarkable exhibit hosted by author Lisa See that has a replica of a Chinese American home and a chinese restaurant--with props and costumes.",Watersprite91
40,A little something for everyone,"If you like paintings and bronzes that are not impressionist, cubist or descended from the many modern schools--that is trees look like trees, streams look like water, et al--then the art work in this place will be of interest to you. Many of the fine paintings recalled the Dutch masters who could paint an image that looked like a photograph. The antiquities, bead work and carvings were something only an aficionado could appreciate. And there was just a Huge collection of old saddles, clothing and six-gun outfits from the most famous and recent movie cowboys to silver screen actors from the '20s that were totally unknown to us. There was a large collection of Colt pistols, mostly presentation models, but sadly the museum staff did not feel it necessary to list the caliber of most of the handguns. As a consequence if you are familiar with firearms you'll get a model number, serial number and other numbers, but no cartridge information. There are also large sets for 'saloons', wagon trains and so forth that give a visitor a sense of that place in that era. The entry fee was fair for the quality and quantity of the materials presented.",oldpo
50,Not just westerns!,"I chose this museum because My hubs loves to watch westerns. He watches one every friday, doesn't matter if it stars George Montgomery and is in black and white. So the Autry National Center (formerly the Gene Autry Museum) was a perfect place to hit on vacation.It's a very southwest style campus, you enter in a plaza and are faced with different buildings. We entered the museum entrance, Not sure what is on the right besides the cafe. The first exhibit was a fine art exhibit and sale ""Art of the west"" it was very interesting how different artists portrayed the west. I wish we could have stayed longer in that wing and written down some names, but the kids were antsy so we started looking at all the pictures with animals in them.This museum has so much going on, there is of course the history of the movie genre westerns. There is also a history of the wild west, complete with colt rifles, and a fancy saloon. Also time is spent on the Native Americans, along with modern native american art. They have stuff for kids too, call for times when they do gold panning. They have a miniature kids play area. Because of Chinese new year they had it styled like a china town, with older and newer ways that people from Asia live.I only have scratched the surface here, There is so much so see and explore, plan a minimum of 2 hours here, I think 3 to 4 would better though.",ClineFam
50,Sometimes it's the food that gets you there ..,whoever wrote the review and mentioned the cafe food was RIGHT !! great food here ..and yes the good stuff is downstairs it must be it was the only place we did not get to ..,bhgoodwin
50,fun & educational way to spend the day!,"the things that go on here are many, and they are all exciting & wonderful... live radio dramas, musical shows, lectures and displays of everything western - including western swing music, cowboy movies, native american cultural materials, actual panning for gold in a little stream outside, occasional native american dances, and a ""i'm in the hoosegow"" photo op for all visitors who want a pic of themselves behind bars...being as it is the largest collection of western art in the known universe, their art collection is quite impressive - as is the collection of firearms & tools. and you can plan ahead to go on one of the days when there is no charge to get in.and their cafe is exceptional!i could spend days here, learning and having fun.ps. obviously, ""agia"" who panned this place never got below the ground floor - you have to go downstairs to see the good stuff. it's too bad that agia didn't ask anyone where the good stuff is (that's always my first question when visiting a museum: ""where will i find the good stuff?"")...",bazi43
50,Western heritage preserved,"A great collection of western art and artifacts at the museum. Their gun collection from the old west was outstanding. The stage coach was interesting along with the old chuck wagon gave you a glimpse of how traveling in the west was like. The cafe was an added high point, the best lunch at any of the museums we attended in Los Angles on our trip.",John N
10,Nothing Here,When I was in LA this museum was rated as the #2 listing for things to do. Based on this I visited this center.I have to tell you I question the reviewers that had such a thrilling experience here. This is nothing but an art gallery. Yes they have one or two minor interactive items but this is a complete waste unless western paintings are your interest.Save your $10 entrance fee.,agia
40,Check out the tranquil outdoor waterfall area,"My friends and I took the free entrance on new year's day. Spent the morning looking at the latest Jews in LA Mosaic exhibit, had lunch nearby in Glendale, then came back to look at the rest for a couple of hours. I enjoyed the lifelike statues, especially the one of Pony Express rider jumping on the horse while grabbing essential items. While the exhibits had a large collection of Hollywood memorabilia, they also represented different cultures such as Mexican / Latino, Chinese, and Native American with interesting stories that help us identify with people long ago. Hollywood exhibits bring back memories of our childhood TV shows and movies!I was just about to leave when I noticed a small outdoor area downstairs, about the size of a large patio, surrounded by large rocks and waterfall. My kind of place!A few other items stood out in my mind: 1. painting of the bear being captured 2. story of the native who was put in San Quentin for protesting the building of railroad tracks near her home, and 3. the 70 lb gold saddles.I want to bring my husband here to look at the saddles and cowboy exhibits as I know he'd get a kick out of them.Driving there is sort of weird. The LA Zoo street exit appears suddenly as the 134 and 5 freeways merge. You exit, then turn left onto the road to get to the parking lot, which is across the street from the zoo. Easy free parking.",superwoman902
50,One of the most engrossing museums ever,"I was mildly interested in seeing this, and the positive reviews on TA convinced us to go. This rates as a top 5 museum on my list, and having been all over the world, you can trust me. Plan on 2 hours minimum, but there is enough to keep you here longer, then you can visit the LA zoo, next door, or drive around to Griffith Observatory.This museum is filled with engrossing exhibits such as western tv and movie memorabilia, pioneers, cowboys, bandits, saloons, pony express riders, and so on. They offer gold panning in the garden, and a see-yourself-in-cowboy-movie experience, and kids over the age of about 6 or so should find plenty of interesting things to look at if they know anything at all about the Wild West. There is also an interesting temporary exhibit on Jewish people in LA which we found really engaging. There is plenty of beautiful western art too. This excellent museum should appeal to almost everyone, even if you think you aren't that interested in the Wild West. I am from LA and am ashamed to say that I have never visited until now, which is my loss. Not to be missed while you are in So Cal. Note that there are several days a month with free admission, so check.",lindagaf
40,Much more than cowboys and Indians,"I never liked those cowboys movies on Saturday afternoon, so I wasn't thrilled when a family member insisted that we should visit this museum. Boy, was I ever wrong! While it does have the obligatory room with old film star memorabilia (and current ones too) it has tremendous appeal for the historian, the art lover (a special exhibit included an Andy Warhol on loan), and the parent with little children who can appear in simulated movies, play with typical antique toys, and pan for gold. It was a morning well-spent. The food in the cafe was good too!",flasuz
50,Lovely & Manageable....,"Each time I visit the Autry, I wonder what took me so long to return. My friends encouraged me to join them to specifically see the exhibition ""Jews in the Los Angeles Mosaic"" before it closes on 1/5. It was a well thought out show & I'm glad I saw it. One should keep mind of this smaller museum. They have staged some wonderful temporary exhibits over the years. They also have some great ""cowboy & Indian"" Western exhibits...great for kids. The museum is not too big and you can see quite a bit even if you visit for...1 or 2 hours. Adult admission is $10. They even provide AAA discounts of 10%. A few days of the year admission is free...as was the case today 1/1. Lots of free parking is next to the museum. Have more time? The zoo is across the street. Even strolling in Griffith Park which surrounds the museum is time well spent on a nice day.",Nancy D
40,Take your time,"The western art collection was small but impressive. The firearm collection, especially the Colt collection was very extensive and well worth your time.",copperking
50,AMAZING!,"The Autry National Center is one of the most wonderful museum ever. I learned a lot of about Jewish people in Los Angeles County as well as the history of Western Cowboys. There is a also a good museum store there, and they have various kinds of interesting stuff. I got a nice music CD from the store.",Ambrose
40,Great museum of the West - with some display issues,"I finally made it to see this museum and I did enjoy it. I love the American West and it was fun to see all the movie and TV memorabilia. Like some other reviewers, though, my main hope was to see some of the 19th century paintings by artists like Bierstadt and Moran, which they do have. The highlight is Thomas Moran's very large 1875 painting of the ""Mountain of the Holy Cross,"" which became politically important in the ""Manifest Destiny"" movement that rationalized the accession of the western part of the continent. It's always a wonderful thing to sit in front of one of these great romantic paintings of the the western landscapes that inspired so many people and in many cases, in pre-photography times, introduced them to the grandeur of the West.One problem, however, was the way some of the paintings are displayed. They had a large glass case with a gown positioned right in front of one of the paintings I wanted to examine more closely and there was simply no way to really see that painting other than at an angle from a distance. Others were high on the wall and some small ones were fronted by wide platforms that prevent proper viewing access. These images were what I came to the museum to see and study, and it was a bit of a disappointment. The Moran made it worth the trip, though. It is a magnificent painting.",JaguarFeather
30,A fitting memorial to a good actor!,"My grandsons and I had our pictures taken in front of the Blue Screen riding a horse racing against a locomotive. It was fun. I believe there should be more young people there to look back at their heritage, but all I saw were mostly Baby Boomers like me!",CSR88550
50,Simply stunning museum,"This was my third visit over the last 10 years, why?, because it is simply the greatest place to visit if you love cowboys and were brought up on the Lone Ranger (the original) and other great cowboys. The displays are fantastic and take a couple of hours and read all about the history of the wild west. The exhibits are truly fascinating, great artefacts like the gun presented to Wyatt Earp by the town of Tombstone and what a collection of Colt 45's and other guns. Great for children too, I have taken my two daughters previously and they loved it. This is a number 1 attraction, go and enjoy.Also interesting to see the costumes for the new Lone Ranger and Tonto.",Andrew G
30,so so museum,"if you're really a western fan, great. I'm not and the Autry is only ok as a museum. We went to a special exhibition and there were mistakes and poorly designed signage to accompany the artifacts. I'm glad I went, but I'm not looking forward to future visits.",freedml
50,"Johnny Depp's ""Tonto"" Costume","It was fun to see Johnny Depp's ""Tonto"" outfit from the recent ""Lone Ranger"" movie while visiting the Autry. The highlight for me, however, was seeing Thomas Moran's large 1875 painting of ""Mountain of the Holy Cross"" from his visit to Colorado (near Vail). I was surprised with the other art on display. As a student of Western History, the Autry was a treat! In addition to the interesting displays downstairs, I also enjoyed its history of Western movies. This museum seems to have something for everyone and is well worth the visit!",Twinder
40,Don't Miss the Short Term Exhibits!,Currently the exhibit on the Jews in Los Angeles is worth a return visit if you haven't been to the Autry for a while. The Autry aslo has special fun events like the Native Comic Book Workshop.,DMcClureDVM
50,Very nice museum with Old West artifacts,We really enjoyed our visit to the museum. We particularly enjoyed the section with the items from the old TV shows and actors belongings.,CMcCarthy645
30,Different than expected,"We visited the museum of the American West expecting it to be like a traditional history museum. While there are elements of the region's history and some background of people who migrated to the area, most of the focus was on the entertainment industry. Sure, the industry is a big player in Los Angeles, and Gene Autury was obviously a major influence in the museum, but I was expecting more general history.The cafe was really good, and it was great that we could park for free. There was also a farmer's marking going on while we visited. It was nice to get some fresh fruit.If you're interested in western movies, this is a great museum to visit. If you're looking for a more general history of the American west, you may be disappointed.",radx4
40,Good museum - cafe good too,"Had an enjoyable visit, and the cafe is good too.There were no crowds, and I understand it is like that most of the time.This falls into the category of ""very do-able"" museums, that is, you don't have to invest a whole day.Loved the section on depiction of the west in movies and tv, and the care taken to explore the role of Native Americans, women, African-Americans...And who knew there could be a Michael Jackson link!",Arncliffegirl
50,Autry Farmers Market,"I've written a review of the Museum, but every Saturday from 8am to 12 noon, the Autry hosts a wonderful Farmers Market with fresh and very tasty produce, honey in combs, food and drink booths, clothing, hummus and fresh bread. A great change from the supermarkets and the price is right. Parking is free and it is handicapped friendly. There is usually live music to listen to as well as tables where you can sit and enjoy the scene. After you can visit the Autry.",Skyros7
50,The Autry...........,"Fabulous western museum !!! Historical hand guns, rifles, saddles, bridles, historical clothing, and amazing Indian artifacts....you'll love it!!",Karen S
40,Autry National Center,"There is lots of western articles inside & the Lone Ranger exhibit. There is even a exhibit of western clothing from a concert that Michael Jackson did in Australia, especially made for him for this with his glove & interesting foot wear. There are lots of western guns & Anna Oakley pearl handle guns given to her from her husband as a gift. They are lovely. It does take a while to go though so have at least a couple hours. Many school children go there on buses. They were just leaving when we entered after 12:30pm on a weekday.",gardentogarden

50,Natives,"Awesome place!It's the museum of the West. I've lived in LA so long I'm sad to say I haven't been here yet. I love Native Americans and the differnt tribes so that was what I was most excited about upon my visit. The exhibits they had were mostly for the Hopi tribe..I was hoping to see exhibits about other tribes.There's exhibits on the cowboys, the diffrent kinds of guns of the west, Native American stories, different horse saddles, etc.Free parking! Try to find a BOGO deal online and bring your student ID for extra discount.",kisssmee
50,USA History,"I loved the way everything was displayed and focused on the move of settlers from the East moving to the West and the reasons they chose to move there.There were quality educational programmes going on with hands-on activities for the children.Indian crafts and culture were a big part in the displays, as were the goldmining and ranching aspects of the settlement of the east part of USA.",lorraineChristchurch
50,A little gem!,"Touring around Los Angeles we stumbled upon this by accident. And what a happy accident it was. The museum is one of the most interesting I have been to. The artwork was phenominal, the other exhibits extremely interesting. For anyone interested in the history of the American west then this is the place for you.",SueyG2013
50,A must see!,"I'm really interested in the history of the West, so I was pretty excited about going to the Autry and it didn't disappoint. I paid just $6 since I had my students card with me.Lots of gorgeous painting, my favorite being ""On the Merced River"" by Albert Bierstadt.The part about cowboys in Hollywood movies was also very interesting, and I loved seeing all the authentic cowboy boots worn by the stars.",PoisonedIvy
50,Fun for the kids,The kids have lots of fun here and I enjoy it too. They enjoy seeing themselves in a cowboy video clip and learning how to play with the toys the Native Americans used to play with.,TTITL
40,Autry Center is Diverse,"It was very interesting and they always add something extra that is really different. We went one year when it was supposed to be an Indian Cultural even, but it was just a bunch of booths where they were selling jewelry and paintings. The museum itself is quite interesting. We have been 3 times.",RoseannaS
50,Spectacular Hopi katsina exhibit and super cafe!,"We visited for the special Hopi katsina exhibit, full of not only the sacred carvings but paintings, videos, interactive exhibits, and so much good information, I had to walk through a second time. While there are some Native exhibits, it is a museum of the west, so plenty of guns and cowboys to go around. I do appreciate a museum where you can visit the café and gift shop without having to pay admission. Yum, chicken adobo fry bread! The guy at the counter reminded us that there are in and out privileges for the museum. What a huge and wonderful place! Free parking doesn't hurt either.",kcdenman
50,Good for whole family.,"Super kitsch, wide range of western items. Covers western movies, especially ""B""s, tv shows. Has quality Native American and Western art, period artifacts, local artwork, local history, western guns. My five year old was entertained for over 2 hours. He loved the interactive movie making display and being allowed to use some period toys.",redorangewolf
50,Outstanding collection of Native American baskets,"For those who appreciate Native American (What Canadians call First People) arts, The Autry houses the basket collection that was formerly in the Southwest Museum. I do not know if it is the best collection of Native American baskets in the world. It may be. But, without a doubt, it is extraordinary! The Autry has made a particular commitment to the Anthropology and History of the Southwest. It is large enough to have an excellent space for changing exhibitions. I have attended some superb traveling exhibitions there. Adjacent to the L.A. Zoo and nearby the Griffith Park Observatory, one can easily spend a day in the area.",Henry K
50,A trip back in Time,"Get ready to transition from the reel to the real, as the Autry does this seamlessly. We went on the 3rd Sunday on the month when they have western singers from 12-2 pm. Don't miss this! The sculpture and bronzes throughout the museum are spectacular and the nostalgia is wonderful, especially if you grew up in the cowboy era of the 50's. The exhibits are ever changing and one visit is not enough. The Golden Spur Cafe ( which was wonderful) is now a full fledged restaurant and is going thru some growing pains but the food is still terrific and the service warm and friendly.",Skyros7
40,Great museum,"wonderful exhibits, check them out everytime they change. great gift shop too! the little café has pretty good food.",ferdferd
50,More than just cowboys!,"The Gene Autry National Center is more than just the history of Autry and his movies. This is a tribute to the true story of the Western U.S.. It's located on the edge of Griffith Park in Los Angeles, and is a unique museum, enjoyed by adults and kids alike!",VegasKen1
50,Some New Exhibits,"I pop into the Autry a few times a year and don't always tour the older galleries. This visit I toured the two temporary exhibits, ""Jews in the Los Angeles Mosaic"" and ""Katsina in Hopi Life"". I spent more time in the first, but only because Katsina has been there a year now and I've seen it twice already. Then I listened to a Gallery Interpreter as he held a group of children spellbound telling them what it was like to be a trapper 200 years ago. I started to take a quick walk through one of the older galleries and was surprised to see it wasn't so old. Nearly half of the permanent gallery on the main floor was new. On the lower level, the OK Corral exhibit, there is opening day, has been removed to be replaced soon. My wife was sorry she declined going, so now we have to go again.",Kenneth L
50,Always a treat,"We visited the Autry because there were signs all over LA advertising an exhibit on the ""Jewish Mosaic in LA"". This was an excellent program even though they failed to have a display about my family :-). The exhibit covered three families from the 1850s on and also the creation of Hollywood by Jewish moviemakers. If you grew up in LA you should enjoy this exhibit.",juless507
50,COWBOYS & INDIANS. YEE-HA!,"A combination of classic American art of the West and movie history as it relates to the Cowboy & Indian genre, the Autrey Museum in Glendale should be a must-see for your out-of-state visitors. Their lovely, intimate theater often presents plays performed by NAFTA, the Native American actors company. This museum complex offers a unique experience for Angelenos and foreigners alike, beautifully presented.",Kris W
50,"Pays Homage to Westerns, Native American History, and More","We hadn't been in years, and decided to take the inlaws. Amid school groups learning about animals and cowboys in the wild west is an amazing museum for all ages. A current exhibit shares the Jewish contributions to Los Angeles in the last 150 years. Other exhibits explain the Western movie experience. A beautiful collection of revolvers--from simply serviceable revolvers to high end bejeweled items.Parking is free, and AAA discounts are available. There is plenty of interactive areas for smaller kids, It's right across from the LA Zoo, so get to Griffith Park early and try to do both.There is a Farmer's Market on site every Saturday, so we'll definitely be back for that as well.",halobb
40,Autry National Center,The traveling exhibit about the Chinese coming through Angel Island near San Francisco and the reading done by Native Americans.,redhatelizabeth
50,Well worth your time if you loe the old west!,"The Gene Autry Museum far outreaches expectations. The layout, exhibits and displays are exceptional. This is the next best thing to the Buffalo Bill Historical Museum in Cody, Wyoming.",58livinlavidaloca77
20,Not what it use to be,"Gene Autry would not be happy, I think. As a western movie fan, I am not. When it opened, it was a great museum. Then they merged and today, the movies are lost and it is almost all high brow culture. The exhibit in the big room was dedicated to Hopi Dolls. The movie section has been downsized and even in this downsized area, there are chunks vacant where they are getting ready to add a section on art. The gift shop is pretty much like the museum - little movie stuff and a bunch of other stuff. Will not be going back.",wff5
50,The Birdhouse -- a Pleasant Surprise,"The Autry Center and Museum of Western Heritage offers a complete season of Native American plays in its cozy theatre on the grounds. My wife & I saw The Birdhouse written by a Native American woman playwright and featuring a number of Native American actors. It was an excellent experience and made us hunger for more! We plan to return in the daytime to tour the Museum, as it is a very special venue for American Western information.",miklep
40,Nice day out,"This is an interesting and well laid out museum experience. It is in many ways a smaller version of the National Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. However it has a bit of a broader collection in that it includes a variety of western experiences, such as the Chinese area that is also an interactive display for children and includes a walk through house for children to enjoy. There are a variety of child friendly displays, beautiful saddle and leather displays, movie cowboy costumes and so much more. I enjoyed spending the morning at this accessible and well planned museum.",BisoninLondon
50,Excellent museum with educational and entertaining exhibits,"Visited with spouse for the first time. Upstairs galleries have cowboy and Autry exhibits, as well as a temporary Hopi Katsina exhibit that is wonderful! Downstairs galleries feature the development and settlement of California, with excellent exhibits and artifacts. Lisa See's Chinese Family exhibit with interactive rooms for kids is also fun for adults. Gold panning outside. Nice gift shop with quality items including jewelry, books, and pottery. Will certainly go back!",Saranger
40,View of Regions' past like no where else,"Was here to see art show and missed the date.WTH-haven't been here in years lets look aroundA history of the entire region, done VERY well. This area, and All it's cultures, disciplines, animals, saddles, tack, outfits, weapons, etc---need to spend at least an hour, probably once a year--",DrWalter
50,If you grew up in the fifties.......,"Watching TV cowboys.....Don't miss this. Great displays of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger, plus other interesting old was west artifacts.",Eugene C
50,Very educational and enjoyable,"The museum was well laid out and organized. It would appeal to both adults and children. Information was presented in a very interesting way. On the 1st floor the museum's exhibits showed the development of the western movie from it's beginning to now. The museum also covered the actors/actresses who performed in these movies. On the bottom floor, the history of the west was covered. It was well done and informative.",ssl56
50,"Educational and entertaining- our history of ""The West""","Only had 3 hours and did not get to go 'deep' into every display - I have to come back again! The Staff were always helpful with answers and assistance. The varied displays keep you wanting to learn more after you walked away. Many childhood memories in the ""Media"" section for us from the '1950's' to smile about. Gene Autry did an outstanding job of starting this and I hope it only gets bigger in time. Wear comfortable walking clothes and shoes - its worth it!",John D
40,great,we would go here again when it is cooler. it is great for the whole family and very interesting. i would go again when in the area or when taking visiting relatives sightseeing.,Robert T
50,Really Great Museum!,"I highly recommend this for a day trip and so much to see. It has a little bit of everything from the western days with many exhibits to view. There is also a section of Native American artifacts as well as a great art gallery to view and purchase. You can pan for gold, dress up in western garb and pretend you're in a western movie! Plenty of free parking and easy to find off the freeway. Great cafe onsite for lunch. Easy walking as it's a self guided tour. Go early as it does get busy with bus tours.",Lynette51
50,Lots to see,"We could have stayed a bit longer but left at closing time. There is so much to see and a diverse collection of things. They had a basket weaving exhibition on when I was there. I can't wait to take my friend here, he will love it.",April402
50,"Incredible learning experience, and an interesting place to be!","Modern, well designed, and well funded. A great place for visitors as well as locals to learn about all of the peoples who made up the American west. Perfect for families with children in the 4th and 8th grades (aligns with state curriculum in social studies). Excellent resource for teachers, and/or any college student taking a course in western history.You enter into a large sunny plaza area. To the right is a café with outdoor seating. To the left is the gift shop. The gift shop is well stocked with something for everyone, in all price ranges. I was pleased to buy a t-shirt with artistic graphic, in my larger size, as well as two posters signed by the artists for only $2 each. An author was speaking that afternoon and many people were buying the author’s book.Upon entering, there were children’s activities in the lobby area. Docents, dressed in garb, walked by. Two employees were very helpful in showing me the location of specific collections that I was interested in, first on a map, and then directing me there. There was a very attractive couple, dressed in western clothing, that I was sure was someone famous (but didn’t want to bother.) Since it was the “3rd Saturday Jam” musicians walked by with their instruments. Crowds gathered to hear them perform.I was impressed with the “Opportunity” area of the museum. It featured real people from all walks of life in the past. Models, photos, clothing, tools, artifacts, all brought people to life. I’ve never seen so many guns in one place: the Colt Revolver exhibit was well displayed. You can see Billy the Kid’s gun as well as other gangsters. A life-size display of the shootout at the OK Corral comes to life with animation. An explanation of the causes of the routine violence in the west was well explained.America really is a beautiful country, and some of the most beautiful landscapes painted are on display at the Autry.A special exhibit on Katsinas & the Hopi is impressive. This has to be the largest collection of this kind. I appreciate the hands on exhibits too. Go ahead and bang the drum and shake the rattle!For students or anyone doing research, the Autry website has a huge “holding”. Some of the collections I was interested in seeing are only available online! Any teacher trying to integrate technology would be happy to find their online exhibits. Entire replica kits are available for classroom use. Each one is centered around a person who lived in southern California in the 1800’s.The only drawback is the limited parking. Maybe it is adequate during the week, but on this Saturday we couldn’t find a place to park. My husband had to wait in the car, circling the lot, while I toured the museum by myself. Yes, the Los Angeles Zoo is across the street but that looked full too. One recommendation if you can’t find a parking spot is to park at the picnic area closer to the freeway and take the short walk in. You don’t want to miss this museum and all it’s wonderful experiences!",KWoodson
50,One of the Best in The West,"Film, tv, paintings, artifacts, music-if it was part of the American west in fact and fable you can find it here. The museum has attractions for all levels of interest and all ages. The bookstore is one of the best I've seen. Allow plenty of time to look at the substantial holdings.",Lewis S
50,Great visit,"Had been to the old museum some years ago and wanted to see what had changed. The museum is easy to get to, we were driving but could see that it was serviced by public transport. The LA zoo is directly opposite and the place was busy. The museum has art galleries as you go in and if you like modern western artists , then you can see some excellent work on display. The exhibitions are very good and we quickly ran out of time only managing to see about half before it loses at 4.00, thought that we could get through in about 2hrs, you should allow 3-4. There are discounts for seniors, students and teachers, have proof in the form of an ID. Will be going back to see the rest and have a look at the zoo next time.",Gareth H
50,West comes alive,A very worthwhile visit. Nice location across the road from Griffith Park and near the zoo. Great collection of western and movie stuff.,Alan B
40,If you like the West...,I happened to hop of the bus and check this place out on a Tuesday afternoon. I think I was the only person in the museum! So Tuesdays are the days to go!

50,"Cowboys, Indians & history? Oh My?","I love the Autry Museum for a couple reasons. One, cowboys/indians, the little boy in me will always love them. Two, American/Western history, art is such a beautiful way to preserve our history/culture. The museum is fairly open and spacious. I've been there a couple times for visiting and even once for a private event. As a museum, it has several wings based on different groupings. My personal favorite is the section about music, such cool outfits and funny to see how small some performers are/outfit details. There is a beautiful wide open grass area out front, so pack a picnic if you can, on a nice day, it is great. This area has shared parking with the LA Zoo as well, I don't recommend both in the same day though.",Erik4Travel
40,A Beautiful History Lesson,"The facility is beautiful, and despite its close proximity to the Los Angeles Zoo the place is never very crowded. Everyone looking for a little bit of history on the west will find the exhibits interesting, and some of them awe-inspiring.",Paula S

You can spend as little or as much time as you want here - I recommend seeing all of it.",Linda C

50,Historical trove of America's Western Heritage,"We visited the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in November. It is an historical trove of memorabilia with interesting information about the western movie era, and the stars of that era.There was an exhibit of Indian rugs and Kachina dolls also. America's rodeo heritage was also well represented. We spent a full day here and enjoyed it very much. There was an exhibit of the Chinese influence on the western heritage, which was made even more interesting because I had recently read a book about the Chinese family that was represented in the exhibit.",moonstone0005
40,Great way to spend a few hours if Wester interests you,"The Autry is very well done and allows you to really experience a section of American history tied to Californian western history and the film industry. They have a massive amount of genuine memorabilia and the layout and displays are excellent. The food service is fantastic as well. The gift shop is one of the better I have seen at this type of venue. In addition to the normal junk, trinkets and books, they have a great selection of genuine western hats and other accessories. One warning though. It is entirely ho-down. Nothing but western here. If that is not your thing, you may be bored out of your skull!",David K

50,Great Museum,"If you like cowboys and old west history, then you will enjoy this museum. They had a great display of old guns. There was also a wonderful display of all the cowboys in television and movies. It is a very kid-friendly museum... in fact, there were several school groups there when we toured. That being said, we just visited opposite sections that the kids did and it wasn't crowded or noisy at all. Really a nice museum to visit!!",vakayplannerPa
20,not as exciting as expected,"I'm not sure if it was the lay out of this museum or the annoying people who were following us and loudly invading our space, but we weren't as thrilled with this museum as expected. We were only happy for about 1 hour.",kknew
50,Great for kids!,"From the outside, I had always thought the Autry to be rather stuffy, but went for a visit with the kids after the Farmers Market, and had such a good time that we're now members and regular visitors. The panning for gold, horse you can get on, and dress-up chinese restaurant are all super-kid friendly, and even the more ""grown-up"" displays like native american dolls and culture had examples you could touch, handle, shake, and see that made it a hit with the kids as well. Not to mention the movie stuff and model pueblos. They often have special events that include craft activities and music (Day of the Cowboy and Cowgirl was a BIG hit) that are great. Highly recommend this as an easy hour to spend with kids in a low-stress museum setting.",LA Red

Given we only got there at 2pm and no-one on the desk said anything, (happy to take our money it seems), this was a drag. Still, the museum is so interesting I'd certainly go back next time in LA. Note : Current show on Hopi culture very much worth seeing.",squonkMelbourne
50,Not Just for Gene Autry Fans,"Although the Autry is named for Gene Autry, and he was the main contributor, the museum covers Roy Roger, Bill Hart, and many other Western TV and movie stars, and art, historic artifacts, and the entire story of the west.There are two main levels and outdoor spaces. You enter the second floor from the courtyard which is often used for events. A theater, cafe, education center, and gift shop also ring the courtyard. There are three main exhibit spaces on the second floor, two for temporary exhibits so you can visit several times a year and seen new things. The first floor has a large open space also used for events, ringed by a 'U' shaped gallery. You can also enter an outside area. I'm told that Disney Imagineers had a hand in the design of the museum and that is most evident in this outside area.I've been to the museum dozens of times but still don't remember which exhibits are in which galleries, so I'll just list some of them. A large section for western art, a large section for the Hollywood Western, exhibits on western history, a gun exhibit, a jail/photo op, a life size diorama of the OK Corral, a beautifully restored horse drawn steam fire pumper, a chuck wagon and stage coach, and more. There is also a children's discovery area.The museum offers many special events throughout the year and shows films. There was a plan for expansion to house the exhibits from the merged Southwest Museum, but the recent economic situation has that on hold.The museum is across the parking lot from the LA Zoo in Griffith Park near the intersection of I-5 and 134.",Kenneth L

50,Interesting collection of western artifacts,"I'm not a big museum lover, so I'm embarrased to admit that I've hesitated going to the Autry Museum in Griffith Park for many years. I was pleasantly surprised to find very interesting western displays, ranging from native American to the western movement and settlements and also the place the ""old west"" holds in our hearts in the form of old westerns on television and the big screen. There is a huge display of old guns, sheriff's badges, period clothing and western theme artwork. It's a beautiful museum with something to offer everyone. Children can even pan for gold on Saturdays!The museum's hours are 10:00 to 4:00, Tuesday through Friday and 10:00 to 5:00 Saturdays and Sundays. Admission is $10 for adults, $6 for seniors and admission is free on the second Tuesday of each month. It's located directly across the street (Zoo Drive) from the L.A. Zoo and parking is free.While there, be sure to visit the Autry Cafe. Its hours are 9:30 to 4:30, so it's possible to grab a quick breakfast before entering the museum or lunch after your visit. We were very surprised at how reasonable the prices were (for instance, a Bronco Burger with fries and a large drink for $7.50) and how good the food was!They have a nice breakfast menu, and for lunch they offer burgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches, pizza, quesadillas and tostadas, salads, cold sandwiches and a children's menu. plus assorted desserts and drinks.The Autry National Center is a day well spent!",travelingrandma91355

I suggest you start on the lower level to make sure you get through the most interesting things. We started on the main floor and it was time to leave before we got through all of the exhibits downstairs. The cafe on sight is a great place to eat.

50,The Cowboy Center of the World,"I grew up glued to the television watching the old TV Westerns. So when I learned that the Autry Museum in LA contained a lot of memorabilia from the old TV Westerns, I had to go. Unfortunately we arrived toward the end of the day with only an hour left before the museum closed.I was taken back by just how much there was to see. I was running out of time just viewing the first floor. I was told that what I really wanted to see was on the lower level so I raced down there. I was speechless to see the costumes of all my boyhood hero’s. Especially the complete outfit for the Lone Ranger. To see this was like having the past meeting the present.I was soaking all of this in when I heard that the museum was closing so I rushed along when all of a sudden I was stopped dead in my tracks when I saw the guns exhibits. I love guns and to have found this huge collection so late in the day was a big disappointment.I left the museum feeling like I had been cheated. I wanted to spend the whole day there and digest and soak in everything. I'm going back and I suggest you go to.",Alain L

My husband could watch westerns for days on end, so he really enjoyed all the memorabilia here. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it, each exhibit shows something different, so if one isn't to your taste, you can move on and see what's around the corner. Paintings in the gallery showcased Native American life, and no one yells if the adults use the hands on exhibits made for kids. Our only regret was they weren't open later, and not a whole lot of inexpensive souvenir options that were marked ""Autry Museum"". Take some time and enjoy!",luvpink11
50,Chock full of things to see,Well laid out with plenty of things to see. Beautiful setting. Would definitely go back or take visitors to this delightful slice of Americana.,DeeDee7952
50,Great for Western fans,"We grew up in the 1950's with heavy doses of Hopalong Cassidy, Cisco Kid, Lone Ranger, etc., so this museum was a lot of fun for us. It probably wouldn't be as good for non-cowboy-oriented folks. There are some interesting original pieces, including the outfits, guns, and saddles of several TV and real Western figures. Also some good explanations of behind-the-scenes stories. If you have, or ever had, the Western ""bug"" then you'll enjoy it.The complex it's in has a good cafeteria too -- moderate prices, decent food & selection, and very friendly staff.The only problem we encountered was getting to it. It was a beautiful spring day and the kids were off school for some reason (Easter-related?), and we spent over an hour in a traffic jam getting into Griffith Park.",J.C.
50,Best Western Collection!,"Growing up not far from where most westerns were filmed, I always had a love of the Wild West and everything about cowboys, the Gold Rush, and Indian lore. I've been to the Autry National Center many times and every time I see more and different things. It's educational, but more than that it glorifies all things West and gives visitors a taste of everything from art to the actual clothing the Indians wore to mock cabins and the real fire trucks and wagons. No one rushes you and crowds are always manageable (except that one time there were tour buses lined up all over the parking lot and there were crowds around all the exhibits--so if you see lots of tour buses, take a detour to the zoo or Travel Town not far away). There's a cafeteria style restaurant, lots of bathrooms, and easy access to everything.I've taken relatives from Europe there and they love it--it validates all their fantasies about what the Wild West was about and they get to be hands on with displays. It's one of my top 5 places to visit in LA!",BritFrenchPol
40,Yee haw!,"I went recently for an art exhibition- they have superb gallery spaces here. The collection of artifacts is excellent, though the displays could use some refreshing. A big hit with the under 10's, though teens begrudgingly enjoy it.",LATripp
50,Bringing friends to the 'old west'.,"Wasn't exactly sure of the date, but took friends from out of the country and they really had a good time enjoying sights of the old west. I had kind of an idea of what to expect, so I dressed in character with my boots, colorful shirt, and bright scarf. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to get a taste of the early days in the west and early days of movie making.",EMPtyOneMUNICH
50,If you love all things western,If you are a fan of the western or cowboy history you will love this museum. The bottom has a ton of guns and other wild west artifacts . You feel like you are stepping back in time . This museum is directly across from the LA Zoo. The gift shop is great also I got some good stuff .,istanbulrocks
30,if you like western stuff it's a nice place,"Beautiful museum but the contents were just so so to my liking. Lots of pictures/paintings upstairs, the better stuff was downstairs so maybe start there. We went on a day that was free via Bank of America.",bubbles911
40,most enjoyable,i really enjoyed the museum. the exhibits were very well done. Very informative. pictures were fantastic. a very relaxing time. just stroll through. it was great to see all the children going through the museum. i would recommend going when not so many children are around. it is nicer to go with someone that was my only regret. there is lots of parking. there are people going threw the parking lot on carts. i think its to give rides if necessary. they were very friendly,arthur63-ardie
50,Return to yesteryear,"I implore all fellow baby boomers to pay this museum a visit. It took us back to the days of B&W TV & uncomplicated lives. Oh, to be a child again! You won't regret the time spent here.",tedandbarbfromla
50,A great collection,"We had a great few hours in this hidden gem. A lot of fun memorabilia, nice art, and interesting historic artifacts. Fun for kids and adults. We went later in the afternoon and almost had the place to ourselves.",jk566
40,Great history of the west,"great museum, I go there often; and I hope to see one of the live shows that have been happening there.",REDMOON_8
40,Brought back memories,Everything is laid out well and was impressed with all the memorabilia. This will bring back fond memories for all of us baby boomers.,1momo1
50,love the history of the cowboys,had a wonderful time taking our family for the day really enjoyed it,cruzzmom
40,"Nice museum, and quiet.","It had several exhibits ranging from The West in the Movies to historical information about the real west. Highlights include props & costumes from legendary westerns such as John Waynes eye-patch from True Grit, Gene Autrys first guitar, & Roy Rogers and Triggers costumes. Also the colt collection was interesting, it had guns that had been owned by several real cowboys aswell as celebrities including presidents.Not a bad price for what you get, we were expecting to be done quite quickly but ended up being there for 3 1/2 hours.",LA-JH1
50,So well done and original,"The great part about this museum it houses something unique to our area....the culture of the old west. For visitors from other parts of the country it provides a unique experience into the development of the west. Well done, pleasant atmosphere and easy to navigate.",clglenn
40,Varied exhibits,Looked at western history from multiple perspectives. Good mix of the serious and the fun.,ygale
40,You don't have to love cowboys to enjoy the Autry.,"There is cowboy (and native American) art on display. When we visited, there was a native American basket exhibit which was phenomenal. You can learn the history of the cowboy, both real and in the movies.",js551
30,Good place to visit for western movie fans!,"When I was a kid, I was able to go to our local theater and watch a horse opera featuring Tom Mix, The Lone Ranger, Gene Autry, et al. And when I first arrived in LA from the midwest, this was one of the first places that I visited in this area.",amercorp
50,Oh WOW..... the memories !,"A MUST see for those in the area. Great exhibits and a terrific staff.Ample parking and a VERY NICE snack bar. Enjoy the museum, have lunch, and go back in. Well worth it.AAA membership card gets you a discount.Free parking.",Mark C
40,"Sweet memories of the ""Good Old Days""!","The Aurty Museum is filled with memorabelia from my childhood era. Gene Autry, movie posters, examples of his guns...This was so much ful!",CherylandBrett
50,You don't need to be a cowboy buff to love it.,"Been here many times; am an Angeleno. What I especially love is its history and art as well as a very worthwhile gift shop. The interactive cowboy displays are fine for those who like that kind of stuff (not me) but the rest is well worth it. A beautiful building. Well worth the visit. Excellent for intergenerational outing: kids, teens, adults, grandparents",RiceMom11
50,BANG BANG!!!,Go every 2-3 months. They rotate the exhibits and there's always something for everyone!!,BigBooster
50,Great Western Museum,"This museum features all the Western film and TV stars like Autry, Roy Rodgers, John Wayne, etc. This would be more enjoyable for baby boomers.",ChinoSJP
50,An off-the-track gem about history of the West,"This museum is a must - I discovered it after living here for years and now I'm a regular visitor and highly recommend it to out of town guests. For anyone who has ever wondered about the history of the Western USA, the pioneers who came here, the American Indians and how music and culture portrayed the American West, this is the place. The permanent exhibits are very good and there are rotating special exhibits plus the Indian Market/trading post events that are fun and include beautiful jewelry/wearable art.",highlandbride
50,Wonderful Hidden Gem!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This not to be missed if you're a fan of tv westerns-or westerns in general. It has an absolutely fascinating collection and includes many many artifacts from shows such as Bonanza, the Roy Rogers Show, Gunsmoke, Sky King.",RoyM1336
40,Western art and memorabilia.,"The exhibits are well presented and explained. Really give you a good idea about what life was like in the ""Old West"".",Slim S
50,A FIne Museum of Western and Indian Culture,"The Autry was founded and funded by Western Movie Star Gene Autry. It is in Griffith Park with free convenient parking and a nice small restaurant. Also a fine gift shop. The numerous galleries have wonderful displays of Western movie memorabilia, articles relating to ""the old West and native American arts and life. It is truly one of LA's world class attractions. No trip to LA is complete without a visit.",rossbacher
50,Saving the history of the Southwest,The collaboration of the Southwest Museum and the Autry has been a boon to the preservation of some wonderful Southwestern art and lore. A really fun destination for the entire family.,JuezJoe

50,"If you like American History, do not miss this.","This museum is an amazing collection of artifacts, history and stories from the past 150 years of the American West. This is an important era of the United States and the Autry Museum presents it in a clear inspiring way. Cowboys, Native Americans, mining, movies and settlers are all part of this museum.

40,Everything Western,"Great morning seeing everything western. Had a wonderful, limited time, exhibit of baskets and basket making. Very interesting and informative about the west being settled. Loved all the western movie clips and exhibits. The only negative I have is that there wasn't enough western music to enjoy. There was several groups of school children visiting and the museum handled them great. Not a problem at all for the other visitors. Bring your AAA card for a 10% discount.",theheatonfamily
50,Wonderful western museum.,Even the cafe serves good food. Great for young and old alike!!,BobCurran
50,LA isn't just about amusement parks!,We wish we had left more time to explore this museum. It had a thoughtful exhibit about the experience of Chinese-Americans that triggered several good discussions with the kids (8 and 10). That was balanced by lots of historical guns on display (5 yr old!).,GlobalFamily
40,Great temporary exhibitions,"Always interesting. Low-key museum portraying the range of the western experience from all viewpoints. Good gift shop, too, with some kitschy cowboy items and fine crafts.",Phineas55
40,Interesting and Educational,We really enjoyed the Autry Museum. It was full of historical photographs and artwork. High recommend this destination spot.,TravelDiva50
50,The old west.,If you like the old west you'll like this museum. AND it's also the neighbor to the L.A. Zoo.,bjd39
40,More to See and Do,I would like to go back as I did not have enough time there!,Caper66_12
50,Always impressed,"This was our 3rd trip here - we're still impressed! It is clearly a difficult balance to strike but the Autry Museum successfully shows the privations of the early incomers, be they of Chinese, European or African origin and the impact felt by indigenous peoples and on their way of life.We saw an exhibition on basket weaving, which was far more interesting than it sounds - this native American practical art was in danger of dying out but a new generation is now getting involved - it was good to see that. Perhaps you need places like this to celebrate those successes.Must recommend going at 9, the Museum opens at 10 but you can get a good breakfast at the cafe then be first in the queue for tickets!There's quite a bit for younger children but for everyone else you do have to engage your brain - other than a couple of static horses, there's no rides here. Ah well!",Hampshire123
50,All Things to All People - A Must!,"This is our fav stop in LA, never miss it when in town several times a year . Best exhibits of all things American, from the beginning of civilization as we know it, from our indigenous ancestors to the modern day wrangler. Special exhibits are top notch. Museum store can be visited without entry fee, as can the really good restaurant, a real value with a lovely courtyard to sit & enjoy, including a glass of wine. Always easy parking. Special events, i.e., Dia de las Muertas is not to be missed!",Barbara C
20,Boring,"Its in the heart of the movieland that made the West and cowboys famous and also seems to have the funding to be an exemplary attraction. So why when I take my 3 teens to this museum are they bored out of their minds? And so I am I except for a few exhibits. So much potential, so little to learn or enjoy. I hope they can learn to improve cause the concept is great- We visted for our 3 rd time and are all disappointed-again",jimboesq
50,More than Hollywood,Really like the Autry because it gives a clear perspective on what the Western frontier was really like in the states and how it differs from that it Hollywood. Very rich history with lots of mentionables if you like old western films.,Dara M
40,A Pretty & Very Comprehensive Museum!,"There are quite a few exhibits here covering a wide range of western interests. Currently, there is a nice exhibit of chicano art as part of a larger Los Angeles retrospective. This museum is also great for kids and has a wonderful gift shop with higher end goods.",thewindatourfeet
40,Gene Autrey Museum provides a nice introduction to the world of Western Art and history of Western Expansion.,"The Autry Museum contains fine examples of Western art including paintings by Bierstadt, Tenny-Johnson, Remington and Russell among others. The Native American Basket collection is large and has beautiful basketry from various tribes. The western movie memorabilia (posters, clothing and saddlery) will entertain the old western movie buffs. The museum is located across the parking lot from the Los Angeles zoo and the area around the museum is nicely landscaped. It is a lovely way to spend a 1/2 day while in Los Angeles. .",Sharon B
50,Enjoyed this unique museum.,"It is a little out of the way - across from the L.A. Zoo - we spent the morning at the zoo and the afternoon at the Autry Museum. There is information about Native American Culture, the old west as it really was and as it was portrayed in television and films.",Tmamacita
40,Cool artifacts and great set up.,"This museum has some amazing history and cool artifacts, pictures and antiques from back in the day. Lovely structure, great for families who are into the museum thing. A must if you are visiting LA.",Nick M
50,Very unique museum,"We visited because my mother-in-law is a huge Autry fan. The museum includes so much informative western items, information, and photos. The gift shop is fully stocked and has items I have never seen before. Well worth a visit if you enjoy our western heritage, Gene Autry, and a new adventure in museums.",qtpi1969
50,Enlightening,"I really enjoyed this museum. They have some great collections, and it all just felt wonderful to see.",Nick_Renwick
50,Great place.,If you like Western art and history this is the place to go. It has amazing TV costumes along with beautiful art.,PaVistor19460
50,Great Experience,Visited the Autry Museum again. Easy to get to in Griffith Park. Wonderful museum. Excellent section on Westerns in the Movies - my favorite section. Lots of displays and varied subjects. Nice gift shop - not cheap. Excellent sandwich shop on premises. They show movies in their theater from time to time. Highly Recommended,wff5
50,So much to see!!!,This is the best of the west we can't say enough about the artifacts and the history that has been recorded here...Thanks to the Autry family.,Jackey_sDad
50,If you like American Indian history and Western/Hollywood history You'll love it,I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to the Autry Museum. It is full of ancient and new American Indian and Western artifacts and in the lower floor a Hollywood history of the cowboys of movies and TV. The guide was excellent and knowledgable. There is a senior citizen discount,walter0406
40,"I give this a great review because it's a fun little museum, but also my grandfather loved it, as a fan of Westerns","My grandfather, who has since passed, loved this museum. He took time at every exhibit and thoroughly enjoyed the entire place. He was 90 years old when I brought him. It doesn't take too long to go through the whole place, but if you want to see the costumes and read the stories, this is a fun thing to do for a few hours. It's only $9 for adults, $3 for children, free under 12 and $5 for seniors (I looked it up again).",Outofdodge_10
40,Well worth a visit,It was the choice of this museum or the Zoo opposite and I am so glad we chose the museum! Our tour guide was called Skip and he was great. He had everyone interested in the various sections with the trunks of various items that he got out. Everything was explained and was passed around for all to look at.This museum seems to be very well looked after and all of the staff were extremely helpful and polite.,Paula
40,Interesting Museum covering Unique Topics,"Being from the Midwest, I know next to nothing about the ""Great American West"". I learned a lot at the Autry Museum, which was incredibly well done. A very neat look at not only the ""Hollywood"" American West that Autry was a part of, but Western American History, and Native American History. The exhibits have neat items, a few nice short films, and a lot to see. I also noticed how clean the museum seemed - not new, but well taken care of. We had a nice afternoon here.",ryanprint
50,Not just for movie fans!,"This museum has more to offer than just cowboy movie memorabilia. The Autry Museum is dedicated to all things West. From the early settlers, to the start of the rodeo there are beautiful artifacts dedicated to the history of all things west. Its also got free parking, and is across the street from the zoo.",Mariemarblehead
40,Fun Day for the Adults and Kids,I attended the Day of the Cowboy at the Autry Museum on July 23 with my son and his twins. I had never been to the museum and really enjoyed it. They had plenty of activities for the little ones (3 years old) like painting your own bandana and learning to rope a pretend steer and rope tricks. They had square dancing and gunslinger exhibitions. I thought the kids might be bored but they even enjoyed the museum part that had great exhibitions of old west items.,Mise48
50,"A fun, lovingly crafted museum","I'm a bit of a western culture buff, and my wife could care less about it. We both were surprised how much we enjoyed this neat museum.",ChrisR35
40,Great Childhood Memories Place for us 1950's and 1960's kids,"I grew up watching the cowboy TV shows like Roy Rogers, Rin Tin Tin, Sky King, Stoney Burke, and playing with my cowboys and horses like Jane West, Johnny West and the Bonanza gang. The museum was fun to see all of the history of the Westerns in TV, to see the various original costumes they wore, the saddles they used, and more. See Roy Rogers outfits and boots, some famous saddles, outfit of the Lone Ranger and even current cowboy gear from recent westerns like the one with Sharon Stone, Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon, and more. It gives you the history of the entire West. The art museum is really nice, some beautiful paintings and sculptures by Remington and others. Outside in the garden they have panning for gold setup for the kids and school groups. The restaurant was good with a good variety of choices. I had the Gorgonzola ravioli and it was excellent. The museum itself is very nice, good design, very nice inside, laid out well. Easy to nagivate through. I spent 2 hours in it and had a nice time. My only complaint was that it was very noisey at times and too many school kids at one time after about 10:30.",LadyAboutTown
50,"I love the museums I call ""the Autry"".","It is hard to fathom what a singing country cowboy from Oklahoma could contribute to the world, but I tell you, the richness of the exhibits, both on-site and visiting collections, at the Autry National Center are something not to be missed. In addition to the collections, there is always something going on that puts the fun in the fundraisers--even with a simple membership, I wish I could visit more often. Gene Autry contributed so much to our world and the preservation of Western heritage that I hope people will continue to experience the museum for many generations to come. Congratulations to Dan Finley for becoming the new CEO.",Sabrina N
50,Just amazing,"If you are interested in history of the American west or western art and movies, this is the place for you. Gorgeous paintings, movie memorabilia, and western artifacts are just a few of what you will see at the Autry. Plan to spend four hours if you want to see everything. This is probably not the best place for kids since it is a museum and the docents keep the place quiet. I love the Autry and I will be back the next time I am in the area.",dodg1988
50,Giddy UP!,"They have FREE day on the 2nd Tuesday of the month for everyone. Parking is FREE too. Bank of America has a FREE day on the first weekend of the month too (if you have a card).I took my 2 year old on a FREE day. I thought just go if we don't like it then we can go to Travel Town. Win Win.First it wasn't crowded which I was surprised being FREE. He did very well looking at everything.Things he loved - riding the saddle and watching himself in a movie. Getting on a fake horse and dressing up like a cowboy. Being in jail. Seeing the buffalo. Wasn't really into the Children's Place...I think it was cause we didn't really get a chance to look since there were students there.He loved being outside going into the wagon, seeing the waterfall, and fish.Definitely a place to go. We brought lunch and ran around in the park. Never went to Travel Town that day cause we were there the whole time.",socalpcktmemories
50,The Fascinating Old West...,"The Gene Autry Museum is one of the more interesting museums I've visited. The museum has several ""galleries"", each with its own theme. There are cowboy and Native American artifacts, beautiful Old West oil paintings and sculptures, potteries, saddles and apparel of the Native Americans and cowboys. There is an absolutely beautiful, huge mural of Western history. Also, a few stagecoaches...one you can climb into.A fun gallery is the one on old TV & movie cowboys with old posters and costumes. You can even watch some of the old TV shows...and try your acting skills, too.There is a patio landscaped like the scenery of the Old West, including a lovely waterfall....and a huge sculpture of Gene Autry and his horse at the entrance.",loveLA
